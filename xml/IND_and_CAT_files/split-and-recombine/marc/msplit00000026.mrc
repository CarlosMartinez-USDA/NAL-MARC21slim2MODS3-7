These hosts were shown previously to have different relative effects on caterpillar performance, resulting in an apparent host-related life history trade-off between large adult body size on the one hand but low offspring survival on the other. To further assess the potential ecological and evolutionary importance of this trade-off, an observational field study of the relationship between male body size and mating success was conducted. Across mating trials, larger males had a higher probability of being observed mating. Independent of the effect of size, the amount of wing damage an individual had sustained (a measure of relative age) was negatively correlated with the probability a male was observed mating. Within mating trials, the mated male tended to be larger than the average unmated male, but there was no difference in wing damage. Overall, results of this study were consistent with a positive effect of male body size on mating success, consistent with the idea that larval host plant history and its effects on adult body size matters in terms of adult male fitness. However, all sized males were observed mating over the course of the study, and the size advantage did not appear to be particularly strong. 3aadults 3abody size 3acorrelation 3adry forests 3afield experimentation 3ahost plants 3alarvae 3alife history 3amales 3amoths 3aprobability 3aprogeny 3atrees 3aCosta Rica 0aArea de Conservacion Guanacaste 0agiant silk-worm moth 0ahost use 0alife history trade-off 0amating 0atropical dry forest 0awing damage0 tBiotropica.g2010 Mar., v. 42, no. 2 p.201-207dMalden, USA : Blackwell Publishing IncwJournal:jnl45461x0006-36067nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1744-7429.2009.00556.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20100313b20100403c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02194naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001400145245006700159300001400226500002400240520108100264650001901345650001301364650001201377650001101389650001001400650002301410650001001433653001501443653001901458773013501477852000901612856008501621856005701706930003301763945001301796946001101809655001201820IND2202403920221120111352.0000207s1999    enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220240392DNAL7 a10.1108/000707099102514412doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aImram, N.10aVisual texture perception in formulated chilled dairy desserts  ap. 22-31.  aIncludes references  aThis study aimed to examine in detail the underlying factors which affect visual texture perception based on existing sensory methodology. The usual properties of dairy dessert samples were manipulated via a full factorial design, with four factors, screened from a fractional design of eight factors. Fifteen assessors, trained solely in visual profiling based on the Quantitative Descriptive Analysis (QDA) method, analysed 16 formulations of mousse dessert products over ten visual texture attributes. The visual profile data were examined using analysis of variance (ANOVA), principal component analysis (PCA) and generalised Procrustes analysis (GPA) methods. ANOVA results showed that cream levels significantly affected all the visual textures (p < 0.05). It was also found that levels of blue colourant significantly affected the perception of creaminess (p < 0.05). The results suggest the possibilities of food formulators producing detectable variation in visual texture parameters which may subsequently affect quality perception in chilled dairy dessert products. 3adairy products 3adesserts 3atexture 3avision 3ataste 3asensory evaluation 3acolor 0aperception 0avisual stimuli0 tBritish food journal.g1999, v. 101, no. 1 p.22-31dBritish Food JournalaBritish food journal (Croydon, England)x0007-070X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1108/000707099102514413Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://www.emerald-library.com/3electronic resource  a20050224b20050301c00000000  aINDdLDP  aNon-US 7aarticle03255naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001900152245011800171300001600289520176400305650001502069650001702084650001802101650001502119650002902134650001002163650001502173650001302188650001802201650001702219650001502236650001302251650001102264650001402275650001502289650001902304650001002323650002602333651002102359653001402380653002602394653001802420653002402438700002002462773010802482852000902590856009202599930003302691946001302724655001202737IND4433775220221120111400.0100313e201003  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443377522DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1744-7429.2009.00572.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOppel, Steffen10aBird Assemblage and Visitation Pattern at Fruiting Elmerrillia tsiampaca (Magnoliaceae) Trees in Papua New Guinea  ap. 229-235.  aMost tropical trees produce fleshy fruits that attract frugivores that disperse their seeds. Early demography and distribution for these tree species depend on the effects of frugivores and their behavior. Anthropogenic changes that affect frugivore communities could ultimately result in changes in tree distribution and population demography. We studied the frugivore assemblage at 38 fruiting Elmerrillia tsiampaca, a rain forest canopy tree species in Papua New Guinea. Elmerrillia tsiampaca is an important resource for frugivorous birds at our study site because it produces abundant lipid-rich fruits at a time of low fruit availability. We classified avian frugivores into functional disperser groups and quantified visitation rates and behavior at trees during 56 canopy and 35 ground observation periods. We tested predictions derived from other studies of plant-frugivore interactions with this little-studied frugivore assemblage in an undisturbed rain forest. Elmerrillia tsiampaca fruits were consumed by 26 bird species, but most seeds were removed by eight species. The most important visitors (Columbidae, Paradisaeidae and Rhyticeros plicatus) were of a larger size than predicted based on diaspore size. Columbidae efficiently exploited the structurally protected fruit, which was inconsistent with other studies in New Guinea where structurally protected fruits were predominantly consumed by Paradisaeidae. Birds vulnerable to predation foraged for short time periods, consistent with the hypothesis that predator avoidance enhances seed dispersal. We identified seven functional disperser groups, indicating there is little redundancy in disperser groups among the regular and frequent visitors to this tropical rain forest tree species. 3aColumbidae 3aMagnoliaceae 3aParadisaeidae 3aRhyticeros 3aanthropogenic activities 3abirds 3ademography 3aforaging 3aforest canopy 3aforest trees 3afrugivores 3afruiting 3afruits 3apredation 3aprediction 3aseed dispersal 3aseeds 3atropical rain forests 3aPapua New Guinea 0afrugivore 0aGymnophaps albertisii 0aParadisaeidae 0atropical wet forest1 aMack, Andrew L.0 tBiotropica.g2010 Mar., v. 42, no. 2 p.229-235dMalden, USA : Blackwell Publishing Incx0006-36067nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1744-7429.2009.00572.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20100313b20100403c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle01916naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002000110245003400130300001600164500001500180520075400195650001400949650001100963650002200974650001500996650001401011650002401025650001301049650002601062650001801088650002701106650001801133650002501151650001801176650001101194653002301205653001901228653001701247700002101264700001701285773009001302852000901392930003301401945001301434946001101447655001201458IND2321582120221120111227.0010618s2000    ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232158212DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTejavathi, D.H.10aSomatic embryogenesis in Flax  ap. 155-159.  a2019-12-05  aCallus was initiated from hypocotyl explants of three elite varieties of Linum usitatissimum L. on Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium supplemented with various growth regulators.

The early transfer of anthers brought about a significant reduction in the number of embryos formed, but nevertheless significantly improved the frequency of plant regeneration. Combining an optimal date of anther transfer with the early addition of colchicine to the induction medium (100 mg l(-1) for 1 and 3 days) led to an increase in the number of doubled haploid regenerants. The results indicate that transferring the anthers after 28 days and adding 100 mg l(-1) colchicine to the induction medium on one day only caused a significant improvement in the ability of green plants to regenerate (7.0 compared to 0.50) as well as in chromosome doubling (success index: 4.0 compared to 0.33). 3aTriticum aestivum 3aanther culture 3ahaploidy 3aandrogenesis 3acolchicine 3aembryo (plant) 3aduration 3aculture media 3aapplication rate 0aregenerative ability1 aIslam, S.M.S.1 aButer, B.1 aStamp, P.1 aSchmid, J.E.0 tPlant cell, tissue, and organ culture.g2000, v. 63, no. 3 p.167-172x0167-68577nnas  aDNAL  a20010702b20010710c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US 7aarticle03257naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100001900171245009500190300001800285520162000303650002601923650001201949650000901961650001401970650001301984650001301997650001902010650000902029650001002038650002102048650002702069650001402096650001502110650001702125650001202142650003202154650001102186650001302197650001502210650000902225650003702234650002402271650002902295653002202324653002402346700002502370700003402395773011702429852000902546856009202555930003302647946001102680655001202691IND4398999420221120095218.0071216e200712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439899942DNAL7 a180929912pmid7 a10.1111/j.1365-294X.2007.03492.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSUNI, SEVAN S.10aMale parentage in dependent-lineage populations of the harvester ant Pogonomyrmex barbatus  ap. 5149-5155.  aWe investigated the extent to which workers reproduce in a dependent-lineage population of the monogynous harvester ant Pogonomyrmex barbatus. Dependent-lineage populations contain two interbreeding, yet genetically distinct mitochondrial lineages, each associated with specific alleles at nuclear loci. Workers develop from matings between lineages, and queens develop from matings within lineages, so queens must mate with males of both lineages to produce daughter queens and workers. Males develop from unfertilized eggs and are haploid. Worker production of males could lead to male-mediated gene flow between the lineages if worker-produced males were reproductively capable. This could result in the loss of the dependent-lineage system, because its persistence depends on the maintenance of allelic differences between the lineages. To investigate the extent of worker reproduction in P. barbatus, we genotyped 19-20 males and workers from seven colonies, at seven microsatellite loci, and 1239 additional males at two microsatellite loci. Our methods were powerful enough to detect worker reproduction if workers produced more than 0.39% of males in the population. We detected no worker-produced males; all males appeared to be produced by queens. Thus, worker reproduction is sufficiently infrequent to have little impact on the dependent-lineage system. These results are consistent with predictions based on inclusive fitness theory because the effective queen mating frequency calculated from worker genotypes was 4.26, which is sufficiently high for workers to police those that attempt to reproduce. 3aPogonomyrmex barbatus 3aalleles 3aeggs 3agene flow 3agenotype 3ahaploidy 3aharvester ants 3aloci 3amales 3amating frequency 3amicrosatellite repeats 3aparentage 3aprediction 3areproduction 2aAnimals 2aAntsxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aFemale 2aGenotype 2aInbreeding 2aMale 2aMicrosatellite Repeatsxgenetics 2aPopulation Dynamics 2aReproductionxphysiology 0ainclusive fitness 0aworker reproduction1 aGIGNOUX, CHRISTOPHER1 aGordon, Deborahq(Deborah M.)0 tMolecular ecology.g2007 Dec., v. 16, no. 24 p.5149-5155dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0962-10837nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-294X.2007.03492.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20071216b20080102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle01949naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245012900126300001600255520082400271650001501095650001601110650001201126650001801138650001401156650002001170650002201190650002501212650002301237650003701260653001401297653002101311653002301332700001901355700001501374700001901389773009001408852000901498939003301507946001101540655001201551IND9204630320221120095235.0920722e199201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920463032DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPurohit, S.10aEffect of phenolic compounds on ABA-induced changes in K+ concentration of guard cells and in epidermal diffusive resistance  ap. 103-110.  aThe study of the structure-activity relationship of phenolic compounds in reversing the ABA-effect on stomata led us to investigate the changes in K+ concentrations in guard cells and in the epidermal diffusive resistance of leaves, after treatment with ABA and phenolics. The amount of potassium localized in guard cells usually corresponds to stomatal aperture in different treatments. Umbelliferone, however, permits stomatal opening without retention of potassium in the guard cells, which is an exception. The effect of phenolics in retaining K+ in epidermal peels is matched by recorded epidermal diffusive resistance changes in the leaves. Although flavonoids and some other phenolics behave differently showing recovery in epidermal peels with K+ in guard cells, epidermal diffusive resistance is not recovered. 3aVicia faba 3aguard cells 3astomata 3aabscisic acid 3apotassium 3amineral content 3astomatal movement 3astomatal conductance 3aphenolic compounds 3astructure-activity relationships 0aepidermis 0astomatal opening 0astomatal aperature1 aLaloraya, M.M.1 aBharti, S.1 aNozzolillo, C.0 tJournal of experimental botany.g1992 Jan., v. 43, no. 246 p.103-110x0022-09577nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03260naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001700128245011900145300001600264520145300280650001801733650002101751650001701772650001501789650002501804650002001829650001801849650001601867650001901883650002801902650004901930650003201979650002302011650002302034650002002057650004502077650002102122650002302143650002402166650005002190650002902240650001302269650002102282650004802303650004502351650004202396650004002438653001802478653002302496700001802519700001802537773006202555852000902617939003302626946001102659655001202670IND9204630920221120095225.0920722e199204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920463092DNAL7 a13753132pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShyr, Y.Y.J.10aGlyphosate selected amplification of the 5-enolpyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate synthase gene in cultured carrot cells  ap. 377-382.  aCAR and C1, two carrot (Dacus carota L.) suspension cultures of different genotypes, were subjected to stepwise selection for tolerance to the herbicide glyphosate [(N-phosphonomethyl)glycine]. The specific activity of the target enzyme, 5-enolpyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate synthase (EPSPS), as well as the mRNA level and copy number of the structural gene increased with each glyphosate selection step. Therefore, the tolerance to glyphosate is due to stepwise amplification of the EPSPS genes. During the amplification process, DNA rearrangement did not occur within the EPSPS gene of the CAR cell line but did occur during the selection step from 28 to 35 mM glyphosate for the C1 cell line, as determined by Southern hybridization of selected cell DNA following EcoRI restriction endonuclease digestion. Two cell lines derived from a previously selected glyphosate-tolerant cell line (PR), which also had undergone EPSPS gene amplification but have been maintained in glyphosate-free medium for 2 and 5 years, have lost 36 and 100% of the increased EPSPS activity, respectively. Southern blot analysis of these lines confirms that the amplified DNA is relatively stable in the absence of selection. These studies demonstrate that stepwise selection for glyphosate resistance reproducibly produces stepwise amplification of the EPSPS genes. The relative stability of this amplification indicates that the amplified genes are not extrachromosomal. 3aDaucus carota 3astructural genes 3atransferases 3aglyphosate 3aherbicide resistance 3agene expression 3amessenger RNA 3agene dosage 3atissue culture 3acell suspension culture 2a3-Phosphoshikimate 1-Carboxyvinyltransferase 2aAlkyl and Aryl Transferases 2aBlotting, Northern 2aBlotting, Southern 2aCells, Cultured 2aDNAxgeneticsxisolation & purification. 2aEnzyme Stability 2aGene Amplification 2aGenesxdrug effects 2aGlycinexanalogs & derivativesxpharmacology. 2aHerbicidesxpharmacology 2aKinetics 2aMolecular Weight 2aPlantsxdrug effectsxenzymologyxgenetics. 2aRNAxgeneticsxisolation & purification. 2aRNA, Messengerxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aTransferasesxgeneticsxmetabolism. 0aamplification 0ain vitro selection1 aHepburn, A.G.1 aWidholm, J.M.0 tMGG.g1992 Apr., v. 232, no. 3 p.377-382x0026-89257nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02802naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024004200133040001800175100001700193245018400210300001400394520122000408650001301628650003101641650001401672650002101686650001201707650001901719650001101738650006201749650006801811650007301879650004201952650002701994650002302021650003202044653001502076773013202091852000902223856009202232930003302324946001102357655001202368IND4433777620221120095208.0100313e201004  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443377762DNAL7 a204158572pmid7 aPMC28418412pmcid7 a10.1111/j.1365-2249.2010.04135.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShanahan, F.10a99th Dahlem Conference on Infection, Inflammation and Chronic Inflammatory Disorders: Host-microbe interactions in the gut: target for drug therapy, opportunity for drug discovery  ap. 92-97.  aThe commensal microbiota, most of which resides in the gut, is an environmental regulator of mucosal and systemic immune maturation. Epidemiological studies suggest that changes in the microbiota may represent a link between a modern lifestyle and risk of certain immuno-allergic diseases. This suggests that the microbiota is an appropriate target for therapy or prophylaxis, the rationale for which is addressed here using inflammatory bowel disease as an example. It is also evident from comparative studies of germ-free and conventionally colonized animals that the microbiota is a source of regulatory signals for full development of the host. In some instances these signals have been defined molecularly, and may be suitable for exploitation in novel drug discovery. Most of the versatile drugs in common usage today were derived originally from living matter in the wider environment; could it be time to mine new drugs from microbial-derived signalling molecules in the inner environment of the gut? Several examples illustrate the potential of the gut microbiota as a rich repository from which bioactives with immunological impact can be mined, and translated to human health care or to animal husbandry. 3aimmunity 3ainflammatory bowel disease 3alifestyle 2aAnimal Husbandry 2aAnimals 2aDrug Discovery 2aHumans 2aHypersensitivityxepidemiologyximmunologyxmicrobiology. 2aImmune System Diseasesxepidemiologyximmunologyxmicrobiology. 2aInflammatory Bowel Diseasesxepidemiologyximmunologyxmicrobiology. 2aIntestinesximmunologyxmicrobiology. 2aMetagenomeximmunology 2aNutritional Status 2aProbioticsxtherapeutic use 0amicrobiota0 tClinical and experimental immunology.g2010 Apr., v. 160, no. 1 p.92-97dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0009-91047nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2249.2010.04135.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20100313b20100403c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02996naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100001900184245013500203300002000338506007600358520154700434506003701981650001202018650002302030650001402053650002002067650001402087650001102101650002602112650004302138650001702181700002402198700001702222700002102239773017602260852000902436856008302445930003302528946001302561655001202574IND4394882420221207123021.0070909e20070904xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439488242DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.07008041042doi7 aPMC19648182pmcid7 a175026042pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShim, Sang-Hee10aAutomated 2D IR spectroscopy using a mid-IR pulse shaper and application of this technology to the human islet amyloid polypeptide  ap. 14197-14202.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe capability of 2D IR spectroscopy to elucidate time-evolving structures is enhanced by a programmable mid-IR pulse shaper that greatly improves the ease, speed, and accuracy of data collection. Traditional ways of collecting 2D IR spectra are difficult to implement, cause distorted peak shapes, and result in poor time resolution and/or phase problems. We report on several methods for collecting 2D IR spectra by using a computer-controlled germanium acoustooptic modulator that overcomes the above problems. The accuracy and resolution of each method is evaluated by using model metal carbonyl compounds that have well defined lineshapes. Furthermore, phase cycling can now be employed to largely alleviate background scatter from heterogeneous samples. With these methods in hand, we apply 2D IR spectroscopy to study the structural diversity in amyloid fibers of aggregated human islet amyloid polypeptide (hIAPP), which is involved with type 2 diabetes. The 2D IR spectra reveal that the β-sheet fibers have a large structural distribution, as evidenced by an inhomogeneously broadened β-sheet peak and strong coupling to random coil conformations. Structural diversity is an important characteristic of hIAPP because it may be that partly folded peptides cause the disease. This experiment on hIAPP is an example of how computer generation of 2D IR pulse sequences is a key step toward automating 2D IR spectroscopy, so that new pulse sequences can be implemented quickly and a diverse range of systems can be studied more easily.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aamyloid 3acarbonyl compounds 3acomputers 3adata collection 3agermanium 3ahumans 3ainfrared spectroscopy 3anoninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus 3apolypeptides1 aStrasfeld, David B.1 aLing, Yun L.1 aZanni, Martin T.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2007 Sept. 4, v. 104, no. 36 p.14197-14202dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.07008041043Available from publisher's Web site  a20070909b20071002c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle03338naa a2200661 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001700129245010600146300001400252500002400266520137100290650000901661650000901670650002101679650001901700650002801719650001801747650001901765650001701784650001101801650002701812650001901839650001501858650001501873650002001888650001601908650001201924650002301936650003001959650006801989650002302057650001102080650002602091650004102117650000902158650003502167650001402202650002402216650003302240650001202273651001202285700001802297700002302315700001702338700002102355700001602376773013002392852000902522856007602531930003302607945001302640946001102653655001202664IND2202480420221120095054.0000210e199907  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220248042DNAL7 a104094172pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRekwot, P.I.10aFertility in zebu cattle (Bos indicus) after prostaglandin administration and artificial insemination  ap. 53-58.  aIncludes references  aA total of 137 cycling zebu cows, each receiving a single dose of prostaglandin PGF(2alpha) were used in an oestrus synchronization programme on three different farms. Of the cows on the three farms, 60.6 and 90.5% showed overt oestrus and luteolysis, respectively. Pregnancy rate to fixed time inseminations following single injection of PGF(2alpha) was 61.4% for farm 1, significantly higher than the values of 45.7 and 46.9% for farms 2 and 3, respectively. The pregnancy rates to second service of rebred cows were 53.3, 50.0 and 50.0% for the three farms, respectively, with no significant differences between each. Fertility classification of the cows based on progesterone (P(4)) concentration showed that 6.6% of cows on the three farms were incorrectly diagnosed as having corpora lutea; 2.9% of them had incomplete luteolysis and 5.1% may have lost their embryos between days 21 and 45 post-insemination. The pregnancy rate was 10% higher in the rainy season than in the dry season. Cows with body condition scores of 3 and 4 had a higher overall pregnancy rates than those with a body condition score of 2. The findings of this study further confirm the luteolytic efficacy of prostaglandin in inducing oestrus in zebu cattle and indicate that the nutritional status of the cows must be satisfactory before embarking on oestrus synchronization programmes. 3azebu 3acows 3afemale fertility 3aprostaglandins 3aartificial insemination 3acorpus luteum 3apregnancy rate 3aprogesterone 3aestrus 3aestrus synchronization 3abody condition 3adry season 3awet season 3asexual behavior 2aAnimal Feed 2aAnimals 2aCattlexphysiology 2aCorpus Luteumxphysiology 2aDinoprostxadministration & dosagexstandardsxtherapeutic use. 2aEstrusxphysiology 2aFemale 2aFertilityxphysiology 2aInsemination, Artificialxveterinary 2aMale 2aNutritional Statusxphysiology 2aPregnancy 2aProgesteronexblood 2aRadioimmunoassayxveterinary 2aSeasons 0aNigeria1 aOyedipe, E.O.1 aMukasa-Mugerwa, E.1 aSekoni, V.O.1 aAkinpelumi, O.P.1 aAnyam, A.A.0 tVeterinary journal.g1999 July, v. 158, no. 1 p.53-58dHarcourtaVeterinary journal (London, England : 1997)x1090-02337nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://journals.harcourt-international.com/wbs/tvj3electronic resource  a20000501b20000508c00000000  aINDdCLD  aNon-US 7aarticle02330naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003200111040001800143100002500161245005500186300001600241500002400257520069600281650001400977650001400991650001701005650002601022650002401048650004001072650002101112650002801133650002001161650000901181650003501190650006601225653002201291700002001313700001901333700002101352700002301373700001801396773019001414852000901604856008201613856008201695930003301777945001301810946001301823655001201836IND2202513520221120095049.0000212e199907  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220251352DNAL7 a104555012pmid7 a10.1038/sj.jim.29006822doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSilveira, F.Q. de P.12aA new xylanase from a Trichoderma harzianum strain  ap. 682-685.  aIncludes references  aA new xylanase (XYL2) was purified from solid-state cultures of Trichoderma harzianum strain C by ultrafiltration and gel filtration.

Leaf area index (L) increased with rise of temperature, and after 85 d was about 10-fold larger at 31 degrees C than 19 degrees C. Over most of the range of temperature, both L and fractional interception of solar radiation were functions of thermal time accumulated from sowing (above a base of 10 degrees C). In this respect, they were tightly coupled to developmental rate at the main apex. In one experiment, only 38% of seeds emerged at 22 degrees C and 21% at 19 degrees C, compared with more than 70% at 25 degrees C and 31 degrees C, but the low population density was compensated by faster leaf expansion by each plant (at 22 degrees C only) and a greater fraction of solar radiation intercepted by unit leaf area. The amount of solar radiation intercepted by stands increased with rise in temperature, but the greatest differences between treatments occurred before the canopies achieved complete ground cover (i.e. solar radiation > 0.9) and the relative effect of a rise in temperature diminished the longer the duration of growth. The dry matter produced for unit solar radiation intercepted was not strongly affected by temperature between 22 degrees C and 31 degrees C. where the mean was 2.1 g MJ-1; the value at 19 degrees C was uncertain since the stands were sparse throughout the experiment. After 85 d, the stand at 31 degrees C had produced eight times the dry matter of that at 19 degrees C--a difference caused mainly by the effect of temperature on the rates of development and expansion. 3aArachis hypogaea 3adry matter accumulation 3aair temperature 3aambient temperature 3asolar radiation 3aleaf area 3aleaf area index 3aphotosynthesis 3aseedling emergence 0agrowth rate 0ainterception1 aSquire, G.R.1 aTerry, A.C.0 tJournal of experimental botany.g1992 Jan., v. 43, no. 246 p.95-101x0022-09577nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03633naa a2200709 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001900129245011300148300001400261500002400275500001500299520149100314650001501805650001601820650002601836650001701862650001101879650001601890650001201906650001801918650001101936650001101947650001901958650001501977650002401992650003302016650001202049650002802061650001602089650001902105650002302124650003502147650001102182650005402193650004102247650000902288650004502297650003402342650002402376650003302400650002402433650001202457650003002469650004602499653001502545653001202560700001702572700001802589700001702607700001502624773013002639852000902769856007602778930003302854945001302887946001102900655001202911IND2202480620221120095216.0000210e199907  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220248062DNAL7 a104094182pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKamgarpour, R.10aPost partum subclinical hypocalcaemia and effects on ovarian function and uterine involution in a dairy herd  ap. 59-67.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aEpisodes of subclinical hypocalcaemia occurred in the first 6 weeks after calving in 6 out of 12 multiparous Friesian cows calving in the winter period and 7 out of 23 calving in the summer in a subtropical environment. In the winter calving group, there were significant (P < 0.05) decreases in mean plasma calcium concentrations (PTCa) on days 6, 27 and 36 after calving in those animals unable to maintain PTCa > 2.0 mmol/L in the first 21 days. These cows had a significantly higher mean body weight and higher mean milk production than normocalcaemic cows. In the summer calving group, the seven cows with episodes of subclinical hypocalcaemia had significantly lower mean PTCa over periods of 21 and 60 days. Intervals until involution of the uterus were negatively (P < 0.05) correlated with mean PTCa over the first 21 and 30 days after calving in the winter and summer calving groups (r = -0.62 and -0.42), respectively. The mean size of the first ovulated follicles was significantly smaller in cows showing episodes of subclinical hypocalcaemia in the winter group and the mean number of ovulatory size follicles was less in these cows at 15 days (P < 0.001) (1.2 +/- 0.17 vs 2.3 +/- 0.21) and at 30 days (P < 0.03) (3.5 +/- 0.43 vs 5.2 +/- 0.54). During the first three dioestrus periods, mean plasma progesterone concentration as a function of corpus luteum area was significantly lower (P < 0.05) in the cows with episodes of subclinical hypocalcaemia in the winter group. 3adairy cows 3adairy herds 3a3-hydroxybutyric acid 3ahypocalcemia 3awinter 3abody weight 3acalcium 3ablood glucose 3auterus 3asummer 3aenergy balance 3amilk yield 3apostpartum interval 2a3-Hydroxybutyric Acidxblood 2aAnimals 2aBlood Glucosexanalysis 2aBody Weight 2aCalciumxblood 2aCattlexphysiology 2aCervix Uterixultrasonography. 2aFemale 2aHypocalcemiaxbloodxphysiopathologyxveterinary. 2aIon-Selective Electrodesxveterinary 2aMilk 2aOvaryxphysiopathologyxultrasonography. 2aPostpartum Periodxphysiology 2aProgesteronexblood 2aRadioimmunoassayxveterinary 2aRegression Analysis 2aSeasons 2aStatistics, Nonparametric 2aUterusxphysiopathologyxultrasonography. 0ainvolution 0aovaries1 aDaniel, R.C.1 aFenwick, D.C.1 aMcguigan, K.1 aMurphy, G.0 tVeterinary journal.g1999 July, v. 158, no. 1 p.59-67dHarcourtaVeterinary journal (London, England : 1997)x1090-02337nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://journals.harcourt-international.com/wbs/tvj3electronic resource  a20000404b20000411c00000000  aINDdCLD  aNon-US 7aarticle02127naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002300110245008200133300001400215520095700229650001301186650002801199650001101227650001801238650001301256650002101269650001401290650000701304650001801311650002101329650001001350650001901360650002101379650002701400650001101427653001501438653001101453700001501464700001801479700001801497773008801515852000901603930003301612945001301645946001101658655001201669IND2321580820221120095252.0010618s2000    ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232158082DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFigueiredo, S.F.L.10aRollinia mucosa cell suspension cultures: establishment and growth conditions  ap. 85-92.  aDifferent types and concentrations of plant growth regulators were tested in order to obtain the best callus and cell suspension culture growth conditions of Rollinia mucosa (Jacq.)

Cellular morphology and viability, fresh and dry weights, pH and medium sugar concentration were determined for cell suspension cultures. Dissimilation curves were used for the characterization of the growth of cell suspension cultures. Picloram provided the most rapid growth and produced the highest biomass, with little variation in morphology (differentiated cells). It also provided the highest dissimilation, when compared with cell suspension cultures maintained in media with 2,4-D or NAA + BA + GA3.

At pH 6.5 the ammonium was without effect. At pH 11.0 even a brief application inhibited translocation for many minutes, while longer applications inhibited translocation for considerably longer. Solutions of 10 mol m(-3) sodium chloride were without effect at either pH. At pH 6.5 ammonium chloride solution contains predominantly ammonium ions (NH4(+1)) and at pH 11.0 predominantly dissolved ammonia gas (NH3). Hence we conclude that phloem transport within bean stems is inhibited by dissolved ammonia gas but not ammonium ions. 3aPhaseolus vulgaris 3aammonia 3aphloem loading 3apH 0ainhibition 0adissolved ammonia gas1 aMinchin, P.E.H.0 tJournal of experimental botany.g1992 Jan., v. 43, no. 246 p.51-54x0022-09577nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03786naa a2200649 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100002500171245015300196300001800349520179100367650001702158650001702175650001402192650002102206650001402227650002002241650003302261650001802294650001902312650001302331650001102344650003002355650001602385650001802401650001202419650001402431650001402445650001802459650001702477650002902494650003502523650003202558650002102590650002802611650001402639650003002653650002602683650002302709650003702732653002202769653000902791653000802800653000902808700002402817700002102841773011702862852000902979856009202988930003303080946001103113655001203124IND4399000920221120090144.0071216e200712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439900092DNAL7 a179959242pmid7 a10.1111/j.1365-294X.2007.03576.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTHORNHILL, DANIEL J.10aMeasuring rDNA diversity in eukaryotic microbial systems: how intragenomic variation, pseudogenes, and PCR artifacts confound biodiversity estimates  ap. 5326-5340.  aMolecular approaches have revolutionized our ability to study the ecology and evolution of micro-organisms. Among the most widely used genetic markers for these studies are genes and spacers of the rDNA operon. However, the presence of intragenomic rDNA variation, especially among eukaryotes, can potentially confound estimates of microbial diversity. To test this hypothesis, bacterially cloned PCR products of the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region from clonal isolates of Symbiodinium, a large genus of dinoflagellates that live in symbiosis with many marine protists and invertebrate metazoa, were sequenced and analysed. We found widely differing levels of intragenomic sequence variation and divergence in representatives of Symbiodinium clades A to E, with only a small number of variants attributed to Taq polymerase/bacterial cloning error or PCR chimeras. Analyses of 5.8S-rDNA and ITS2 secondary structure revealed that some variants possessed base substitutions and/or indels that destabilized the folded form of these molecules; given the vital nature of secondary structure to the function of these molecules, these likely represent pseudogenes. When similar controls were applied to bacterially cloned ITS sequences from a recent survey of Symbiodinium diversity in Hawaiian Porites spp., most variants (~87.5%) possessed unstable secondary structures, had unprecedented mutations, and/or were PCR chimeras. Thus, data obtained from sequencing of bacterially cloned rDNA genes can substantially exaggerate the level of eukaryotic microbial diversity inferred from natural samples if appropriate controls are not applied. These considerations must be taken into account when interpreting sequence data generated by bacterial cloning of multicopy genes such as rDNA. 3aSymbiodinium 3abiodiversity 3achimerism 3aeukaryotic cells 3aevolution 3agenetic markers 3ainternal transcribed spacers 3ainvertebrates 3amicroorganisms 3amutation 3aoperon 3apolymerase chain reaction 3apseudogenes 3aribosomal DNA 3asurveys 3asymbiosis 2aArtifacts 2aBase Sequence 2aBiodiversity 2aDNA, Ribosomalxgenetics 2aEukaryotic Cellsxmicrobiology 2aGenetic Variationxgenetics 2aGenomexgenetics 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPhylogeny 2aPolymerase Chain Reaction 2aPseudogenesxgenetics 2aSequence Alignment 2aTranscription, Geneticxgenetics 0abacterial cloning 0aDGGE 0aITS 0arDNA1 aLAJEUNESSE, TODD C.1 aSANTOS, SCOTT R.0 tMolecular ecology.g2007 Dec., v. 16, no. 24 p.5326-5340dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0962-10837nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-294X.2007.03576.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20071216b20080102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02962naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003900111040001800150072000900168100001700177245008000194300001600274500002400290500001500314520172300329650002002052650002102072650002402093650002002117650001802137650001402155650001202169650001502181653001902196700001402215700001802229700001402247700001602261773008802277852000902365856007302374930003302447945002502480946001102505655001202516IND4382532720140723000000.0060803e200610  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438253272DNAL7 a220628382pmid7 a10.1016/j.meatsci.2006.03.0232doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ5021 aTeixeira, A.10aIn vivo estimation of lamb carcass composition by real-time ultrasonography  ap. 289-295.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThe objective of this study was to evaluate the accuracy of ultrasonography to measure fat thickness in live lambs and predict carcass composition to find a system that can assess carcass composition easily and accurately, without damage to the product and can improve carcass classification. Fat thickness (FTh) between the 12th and 13th ribs and between the 3rd and 4th lumbar vertebrae, was measured in vivo using real-time ultrasound, in 67 Churra Galega Bragançana males (mean weight 36.0 kg, range 21.5-47.0 kg), using an ALOKA SSD-500V equipped with two probes (5 and 7.5 MHz) in order to predict carcass composition. The most satisfactory correlation between carcass and ultrasound measurements was between the 3rd and 4th lumbar vertebrae fat thickness (FTh). The first variable admitted in the models to predict carcass composition (live weight, LW) explained between 63% and 96% of the total variation of the weight of the components of the carcass. In fact, 96% of the variation in total amount of muscle was accounted for by live weight. The inclusion of the ultrasound measures with the 7.5 MHz probe improved, in all prediction equations, the coefficient of determination (R2) with a substantial reduction in the residual standard deviation (RSD). In relation to the subcutaneous fat of the carcass, 85% of the variation was explained by live weight and the FTh 12-13 7.5 measurement. In the prediction model for total carcass fat weight, live weight and ultrasound fat thickness measurement explained 88% of the variation. The results indicate that in vivo ultrasound fat thickness measures in association with live weight can be used to predict carcass composition in Churra Galega Bragançana lambs. 3aultrasonography 3ameat composition 3adressing percentage 3aovine carcasses 3afat thickness 3alean meat 3abackfat 3aprediction 0alamb carcasses1 aMatos, S.1 aRodrigues, S.1 aDelfa, R.1 aCadavez, V.0 tMeat science.g2006 Oct., v. 74, no. 2 p.289-295dElsevier Sciencex0309-17407nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.meatsci.2006.03.0233electronic resource  a20061030b20061102c00000000  aINDdPNNe2006/10/30  aNon-US 7aarticle03427naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100002000184245010800204300002000312506007600332520180100408506003702209650002202246650001502268650002502283650001802308650001902326650001102345650001002356650002002366650001602386650001102402650000902413650001202422650001502434650001702449650002302466700001902489700001902508700002002527700002702547700002102574773017602595852000902771856008302780930003302863946001302896655001202909IND4393628120221207122944.0070729e20070724xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439362812DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.07053461042doi7 aPMC19414992pmcid7 a176408802pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMarutle, Amelia10aModulation of human neural stem cell differentiation in Alzheimer (APP23) transgenic mice by phenserine  ap. 12506-12511.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aIn a previous study, we found that human neural stem cells (HNSCs) exposed to high concentrations of secreted amyloid-precursor protein (sAPP) in vitro differentiated into mainly astrocytes, suggesting that pathological alterations in APP processing during neurodegenerative conditions such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) may prevent neuronal differentiation of HNSCs. Thus, successful neuroplacement therapy for AD may require regulating APP expression to favorable levels to enhance neuronal differentiation of HNSCs. Phenserine, a recently developed cholinesterase inhibitor (ChEI), has been reported to reduce APP levels in vitro and in vivo. In this study, we found reductions of APP and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) levels in the hippocampus of APP23 mice after 14 days treatment with (+)-phenserine (25 mg/kg) lacking ChEI activity. No significant change in APP gene expression was detected, suggesting that (+)-phenserine decreases APP levels and reactive astrocytes by posttranscription regulation. HNSCs transplanted into (+)-phenserine-treated APP23 mice followed by an additional 7 days of treatment with (+)-phenserine migrated and differentiated into neurons in the hippocampus and cortex after 6 weeks. Moreover, (+)-phenserine significantly increased neuronal differentiation of implanted HNSCs in hippocampal and cortical regions of APP23 mice and in the CA1 region of control mice. These results indicate that (+)-phenserine reduces APP protein in vivo and increases neuronal differentiation of HNSCs. Combination use of HNSC transplantation and treatment with drugs such as (+)-phenserine that modulate APP levels in the brain may be a useful tool for understanding mechanisms regulating stem cell migration and differentiation during neurodegenerative conditions in AD.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aAlzheimer disease 3aastrocytes 3acell differentiation 3acell movement 3acholinesterase 3acortex 3adrugs 3agene expression 3ahippocampus 3ahumans 3amice 3aneurons 3astem cells 3atherapeutics 3atransgenic animals1 aOhmitsu, Masao1 aNilbratt, Mats1 aGreig, Nigel H.1 aNordberg, A.q(Agneta)1 aSugaya, Kiminobu0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2007 July 24, v. 104, no. 30 p.12506-12511dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.07053461043Available from publisher's Web site  a20070729b20070802c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle03219naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100001700184245008400201300002000285506007600305520171400381506003702095650002402132650001702156650001002173650001902183650000902202650002202211650002202233650002702255650001602282650001602298650001502314650001302329650002902342700002302371700002102394700002002415773017602435852000902611856008302620930003302703946001302736655001202749IND4394884720221207122930.0070909e20070904xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439488472DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.07068171042doi7 aPMC19521382pmcid7 a177208042pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCarroll, Joe10aIdentification of membrane proteins by tandem mass spectrometry of protein ions  ap. 14330-14335.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe most common way of identifying proteins in proteomic analyses is to use short segments of sequence ("tags") determined by mass spectrometric analysis of proteolytic fragments. The approach is effective with globular proteins and with membrane proteins with significant polar segments between membrane-spanning α-helices, but it is ineffective with other hydrophobic proteins where protease cleavage sites are either infrequent or absent. By developing methods to purify hydrophobic proteins in organic solvents and by fragmenting ions of these proteins by collision induced dissociation with argon, we have shown that partial sequences of many membrane proteins can be deduced easily by manual inspection. The spectra from small proteolipids (1-4 transmembrane α-helices) are dominated usually by fragment ions arising from internal amide cleavages, from which internal sequences can be obtained, whereas the spectra from larger membrane proteins (5-18 transmembrane α-helices) often contain fragment ions from N- and/or C-terminal parts yielding sequences in those regions. With these techniques, we have, for example, identified an abundant protein of unknown function from inner membranes of mitochondria that to our knowledge has escaped detection in proteomic studies, and we have produced sequences from 10 of 13 proteins encoded in mitochondrial DNA. They include the ND6 subunit of complex I, the last of its 45 subunits to be analyzed. The procedures have the potential to be developed further, for example by using newly introduced methods for protein ion dissociation to induce fragmentation of internal regions of large membrane proteins, which may remain partially folded in the gas phase.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aargon (noble gases) 3adissociation 3agases 3ahydrophobicity 3aions 3amembrane proteins 3amitochondrial DNA 3amitochondrial membrane 3aproteinases 3aproteolysis 3aproteomics 3asolvents 3atandem mass spectrometry1 aAltman, Matthew C.1 aFearnley, Ian M.1 aWalker, John E.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2007 Sept. 4, v. 104, no. 36 p.14330-14335dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.07068171043Available from publisher's Web site  a20070909b20071002c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02807naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100002400184245011200208300002000320506007600340520128000416506003701696650002901733650001501762650002201777650001701799650001001816650002701826650001301853650004901866650001301915650002001928650001201948650002601960650001701986650001102003700002102014773017602035852000902211856008302220930003302303946001302336655001202349IND4393627720221207122945.0070729e20070724xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439362772DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.07055331042doi7 aPMC19205372pmcid7 a176361262pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNüesch, Jürg P.F.12aA viral adaptor protein modulating casein kinase II activity induces cytopathic effects in permissive cells  ap. 12482-12487.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aAutonomous parvoviruses induce severe morphological and physiological alterations in permissive host cells, eventually leading to cell lysis and release of progeny virions. Viral cytopathic effects (CPE) result from specific rearrangements and destruction of cytoskeletal micro- and intermediate filaments. We recently reported that inhibition of endogenous casein kinase II (CKII) protects target cells from parvovirus minute virus of mice (MVM)-induced CPE, pointing to this kinase as an effector of MVM toxicity. The present work shows that the parvoviral NS1 protein mediates CKII-dependent cytoskeletal alterations and cell death. NS1 can act as an adaptor molecule, linking the cellular protein kinase CKIIα to tropomyosin and thus modulating the substrate specificity of the kinase. This action results in an altered tropomyosin phosphorylation pattern both in vitro and in living cells. The capacity of NS1 to induce CPE was impaired by mutations abolishing binding with either CKIIα or tropomyosin. The cytotoxic adaptor function of NS1 was confirmed with fusion peptides, where the tropomyosin-binding domain of NS1 and CKIIα are physically linked. These adaptor peptides were able to mimic NS1 in its ability to induce death of transformed MVM-permissive cells.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aRodent protoparvovirus 1 3acell death 3acytopathogenicity 3acytotoxicity 3adeath 3aintermediate filaments 3amutation 3anon-specific serine/threonine protein kinase 3apeptides 3aphosphorylation 3aprogeny 3asubstrate specificity 3atropomyosins 3avirion1 aRommelaere, Jean0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2007 July 24, v. 104, no. 30 p.12482-12487dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.07055331043Available from publisher's Web site  a20070729b20070802c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02766naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003900111040001800150072000900168100001600177245016400193300001600357500002400373500001500397520114100412650004701553650001701600650003701617650002001654650002101674650001601695650001601711650001301727650002701740650002801767650002601795650001401821650002101835650001301856650002001869650002701889651001001916653001401926700001301940700001601953700001601969773008801985852000902073856007302082930003302155945002502188946001102213655001202224IND4382533120221120080330.0060803e200610  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438253312DNAL7 a220628372pmid7 a10.1016/j.meatsci.2006.03.0202doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ1221 aIacumin, L.10aMolecular and technological characterization of Staphylococcus xylosus isolated from naturally fermented Italian sausages by RAPD, Rep-PCR and Sau-PCR analysis  ap. 281-288.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aCoagulase-negative cocci (CNC) are important microorganisms in fermented sausages because they release lipases and proteases that are able to free short-chain fatty acids and peptides and aminoacids, respectively, that are responsible for the aroma of fermented sausage. The purpose of this study was to characterize Staphylococcus xylosus strains isolated from naturally fermented sausages, produced in three different processing plants in the Friuli Venezia Giulia region in the Northeast of Italy. Two hundred and forty-nine strains of S. xylosus were identified by species-specific PCR and subjected to molecular and technological characterization. RAPD-PCR with primer M13, Rep-PCR using primer (GTG)5 and Sau-PCR with primer SAG1 were used for the molecular analysis, while the capability of the strains to grow at different temperatures and in the presence of NaCl and their lipolytic and proteolytic activity were tested in order to define the technological characteristics. The results obtained allowed us to differentiate strains coming from different plants, thereby admitting the presence of strains that are plant-specific. 3arandom amplified polymorphic DNA technique 3afermentation 3acoagulase negative staphylococci 3afermented foods 3afree amino acids 3aproteinases 3aproteolysis 3apeptides 3atriacylglycerol lipase 3ashort chain fatty acids 3amolecular systematics 3alipolysis 3amicrobial growth 3asausages 3aenzyme activity 3aStaphylococcus xylosus 3aItaly 0aisolation1 aComi, G.1 aCantoni, C.1 aCocolin, L.0 tMeat science.g2006 Oct., v. 74, no. 2 p.281-288dElsevier Sciencex0309-17407nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.meatsci.2006.03.0203electronic resource  a20061030b20061102c00000000  aINDdPNNe2006/10/30  aNon-US 7aarticle02967naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100002600184245010600210300002000316500001500336506007600351520110400427506003701531650001601568650002501584650002701609650001801636650001601654650001501670650002601685650002901711650000901740650002201749650002501771650001001796653001001806700002301816700002401839700002101863700002101884700001501905700001201920700001901932700002201951700002201973700002001995700002802015700002002043773017602063852000902239856008302248930003302331946001302364655001202377IND4393627020221207122933.0070729e20070724xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439362702DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.07048701042doi7 aPMC19414882pmcid7 a176408842pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGosling, Katharine M.12aA mutation in a chromosome condensin II subunit, kleisin β, specifically disrupts T cell development  ap. 12445-12450.  a2019-12-04  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aCondensins are ubiquitously expressed multiprotein complexes that are important for chromosome condensation and epigenetic regulation of gene transcription, but whose specific roles in vertebrates are poorly understood. We describe a mouse strain, nessy, isolated during an ethylnitrosourea screen for recessive immunological mutations. The nessy mouse has a defect in T lymphocyte development that decreases circulating T cell numbers, increases their expression of the activation/memory marker CD44, and dramatically decreases the numbers of CD4⁺CD8⁺ thymocytes and their immediate DN4 precursors. A missense mutation in an unusual alternatively spliced first exon of the kleisin β gene, a member of the condensin II complex, was shown to be responsible and act in a T cell-autonomous manner. Despite the ubiquitous expression and role of condensins, kleisin βnes/nes mice were viable, fertile, and showed no defects even in the parallel pathway of B cell lymphocyte differentiation. These data define a unique lineage-specific requirement for kleisin β in mammalian T cell differentiation.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aepigenetics 3aalternative splicing 3amultiprotein complexes 3aT-lymphocytes 3achromosomes 3athymocytes 3achromosome morphology 3atranscription (genetics) 3amice 3amissense mutation 3acell differentiation 3aexons 0agenes1 aMakaroff, Lydia E.1 aTheodoratos, Angelo1 aKim, Yŏng-hŭi.1 aWhittle, Belinda1 aRui, Lixin1 aWu, Hua1 aHong, Nancy A.1 aKennedy, Gavin C.1 aFritz, Julie-Anne1 aYates, Adele L.1 aGoodnow, Christopher C.1 aFahrer, Aude M.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2007 July 24, v. 104, no. 30 p.12445-12450dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.07048701043Available from publisher's Web site  a20070729b20070802c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02871naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100001500171245017500186300001800361520107200379650002401451650001401475650002001489650002201509650001301531650001501544650000901559650001601568650002101584650001301605650001201618650001201630650002801642650001401670650002901684650001401713650001701727650003701744650002201781650002601803650002401829651001201853651001201865653002201877653002201899653002301921700001601944700001301960700001201973700002201985773011702007852000902124856009202133930003302225946001102258655001202269IND4392947320221120080227.0070708e200707  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439294732DNAL7 a176149122pmid7 a10.1111/j.1365-294X.2007.03353.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBROUAT, C.10aPopulation genetic structure of two ecologically distinct multimammate rats: the commensal Mastomys natalensis and the wild Mastomys erythroleucus in southeastern Senegal  ap. 2985-2997.  aUsing the same set of microsatellite markers, we compared the population genetic structure of two Mastomys species, one being exclusively commensal in southeastern Senegal, and the other being continuously distributed outside villages in this region. Both species were sampled in the same landscape context and at the same spatial scale. According to the expectations based on the degree of habitat patchiness (which is higher for commensal populations in this rural area), genetic diversity was lower and genetic differentiation was higher in commensal populations of Mastomys natalensis than in wild populations of Mastomys erythroleucus. Contrasting estimates of effective dispersal and current migration rates corroborates previous data on differences in social structure between the two species. Isolation-by-distance analyses showed that human-mediated dispersal is not a major factor explaining the pattern of genetic differentiation for M. natalensis, and that gene flow is high and random between M. erythroleucus populations at the spatial scale considered. 3aMastomys natalensis 3agene flow 3agenetic markers 3agenetic variation 3ahabitats 3alandscapes 3arats 3arural areas 3asocial structure 3avillages 2aAlleles 2aAnimals 2aAnimals, Wildxgenetics 2aEcosystem 2aGene Frequencyxgenetics 2aGeography 2aHeterozygote 2aMicrosatellite Repeatsxgenetics 2aMurinaexgenetics 2aPolymorphism, Genetic 2aPopulation Dynamics 3aSenegal 0aSenegal 0acommensal habitat 0agenetic structure 0ahabitat patchiness1 aLOISEAU, A.1 aKANE, M.1 aBÂ, K.1 aDUPLANTIER, J.-M.0 tMolecular ecology.g2007 July, v. 16, no. 14 p.2985-2997dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0962-10837nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-294X.2007.03353.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20070708b20070802c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03737naa a2200661 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100002100171245010700192300001800299520173200317650001602049650001302065650002002078650002202098650002602120650001502146650001002161650001502171650001102186650002002197650001502217650002302232650002202255650002002277650002502297650001202322650002102334650001202355650005302367650002402420650001602444650002202460650003102482650002302513650002402536650002102560650003302581653003202614653001402646653001902660653002202679700001802701700001902719700001802738700002402756700002002780773011802800852000902918856009202927930003303019946001103052655001203063IND4395099020221120063026.0070916e200709  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439509902DNAL7 a178505492pmid7 a10.1111/j.1365-294X.2007.03441.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aANTON, CHRISTIAN10aPopulation structure of a large blue butterfly and its specialist parasitoid in a fragmented landscape  ap. 3828-3838.  aHabitat fragmentation may interrupt trophic interactions if herbivores and their specific parasitoids respond differently to decreasing connectivity of populations. Theoretical models predict that species at higher trophic levels are more negatively affected by isolation than lower trophic level species. By combining ecological data with genetic information from microsatellite markers we tested this hypothesis on the butterfly Maculinea nausithous and its specialist hymenopteran parasitoid Neotypus melanocephalus. We assessed the susceptibility of both species to habitat fragmentation by measuring population density, rate of parasitism, overall genetic differentiation (θST) and allelic richness in a large metapopulation. We also simulated the dynamics of genetic differentiation among local populations to asses the relative effects of migration rate, population size, and haplodiploid (parasitoid) and diploid (host) inheritance on metapopulation persistence. We show that parasitism by N. melanocephalus is less frequent at larger distances to the nearest neighbouring population of M. nausithous hosts, but that host density itself is not affected by isolation. Allelic richness was independent of isolation, but the mean genetic differentiation among local parasitoid populations increased with the distance between these populations. Overall, genetic differentiation in the parasitoid wasp was much greater than in the butterfly host and our simulations indicate that this difference is due to a combination of haplodiploidy and small local population sizes. Our results thus support the hypothesis that Neotypus parasitoid wasps are more sensitive to habitat fragmentation than their Maculinea butterfly hosts. 3abutterflies 3adiploidy 3agenetic markers 3agenetic variation 3ahabitat fragmentation 3aherbivores 3ahosts 3alandscapes 3amodels 3aparasitic wasps 3aparasitism 3apopulation density 3apopulation growth 3apopulation size 3apopulation structure 2aAlleles 2aAnimal Migration 2aAnimals 2aButterfliesxgeneticsxparasitologyxphysiology. 2aComputer Simulation 2aEnvironment 2aGenetic Variation 2aHost-Parasite Interactions 2aPopulation Density 2aPopulation Dynamics 2aSocial Isolation 2aWaspsxgeneticsxphysiology. 0ahost-parasitoid interaction 0aMaculinea 0ametapopulation 0aspatial structure1 aZEISSET, INGA1 aMUSCHE, MARTIN1 aDURKA, WALTER1 aBOOMSMA, JACOBUS J.1 aSettele, Josef.0 tMolecular ecology.g2007 Sept., v. 16, no. 18 p.3828-3838dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0962-10837nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-294X.2007.03441.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20070916b20071002c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02959naa a2200649 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100001600171245011200187300001800299520097500317650001601292650002001308650001901328650002001347650002201367650001501389650002701404650002201431650002201453650002501475650001201500650001701512650002401529650001801553650001201571650002601583650003301609650002501642650002201667650003701689650002801726650002401754650002301778650002701801651002001828653002101848653002601869653001701895700001601912700001701928700001801945700001601963700002001979700002001999700001602019773011702035852000902152856009202161930003302253946001102286655001202297IND4392248420221120063023.0070610e200706  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439224842DNAL7 a175619042pmid7 a10.1111/j.1365-294X.2007.03291.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIYENGAR, A.10aRemnants of ancient genetic diversity preserved within captive groups of scimitar-horned oryx (Oryx dammah)  ap. 2436-2449.  aScimitar-horned oryx, now considered extinct in the wild, persists in large numbers in captivity. In this first molecular genetic study on this species, we explore the patterns of genetic diversity across European, North American, and a few other captive groups using microsatellite markers and mitochondrial control region sequencing. Strong population structure was not evident from microsatellite data but we discovered deep divergence within the mitochondrial DNA haplotypes from a network analysis where three disconnected networks were obtained, with estimated divergence times of c. 2.1-2.7 million years. Mismatch distribution analyses suggest population expansions c. 1.2 and 0.5 million years ago. We discuss our findings in the context of historical climatic changes in North Africa and use information obtained on current patterns of genetic diversity within captive groups to make recommendations for future captive management and reintroduction strategies. 3aOryx dammah 3acaptive animals 3aclimate change 3agenetic markers 3agenetic variation 3ahaplotypes 3amicrosatellite repeats 3amitochondrial DNA 3apopulation growth 3apopulation structure 2aAnimals 2aAnimals, Zoo 2aAntelopesxgenetics 2aBase Sequence 2aClimate 2aDNA Primersxgenetics 2aDNA, Mitochondrialxgenetics 2aEvolution, Molecular 2aGenetic Variation 2aMicrosatellite Repeatsxgenetics 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPopulation Dynamics 2aSequence Alignment 2aSequence Analysis, DNA 3aNorthern Africa 0acaptive breeding 0aconservation genetics 0aHippotragini1 aGilbert, T.1 aWOODFINE, T.1 aKNOWLES, J.M.1 aDINIZ, F.M.1 aBRENNEMAN, R.A.1 aLOUIS, E.E.

(Cicer) inoculation and N fertilization on six chickpea cultivars (Baladi, Gabel marra, NEC 25-27, NEC 2010, ILC 1919, and Flip 85-108). Plants were either inoculated with three Rhizobium sp. (Cicer) strains (TAL 480, TAL 620 and TAL 1148) separately, or N fertilized (50 kg N ha(-1)). The results of the two seasons indicated the absence of infective strains for chickpea in the soil. Rhizobium inoculation or N fertilization significantly increased the total nodule number per plant, 100 seed weight, yield and protein content of seeds. The results indicated that the three Rhizobium strains are infective and effective in nitrogen fixation. Inoculation with Rhizobium strain TAL 1148 resulted in a significant increment in most of the parameters studied, compared to other strains and untreated control. Cultivar ILC 1919 was the best yielding cultivar, whereas, cultivar NEC 2010 contained the highest protein content, however cultivar Gabel marra showed the highest amount of protein due to inoculation or N fertilization, in the two seasons. Inoculation with Rhizobium strain TAL 1148 increased yield by 72 and 70%, whereas, 50 kg N ha(-1) increased it by 70 and 69% in the first and second seasons, respectively. The amounts of protein accumulated (kg ha(-1)) due to N or Rhizobium inoculation were determined for all cultivars. The results obtained from the inoculation were comparable to those of 50 kg N ha(-1). 3aCicer arietinum 3aRhizobium 3asoil inoculation 3aurea 3acultivars 3astrain differences 3aroot nodules 3anodulation 3acrop yield 3aprotein content 3anitrogen fixation 3aapplication rate 3aSudan 0aseed weight1 aElsheikh, E.A.E.0 tNutrient cycling in agroecosystems.g1999 May, v. 54, no. 1 p.57-63dKluwer Academic Publishersx1385-13147nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.wkap.nl/kapis/CGI-BIN/WORLD/jrnltoc.htm?1385-13143Tables of contents  a20000302b20000309c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US 7aarticle02934naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100002000184245006500204300002000269506007600289520161500365506003701980650002602017650002302043650002202066650001302088650002402101650001602125650001402141700001602155700002902171700002202200773017602222852000902398856008302407930003302490946001302523655001202536IND4394883120221207134335.0070909e20070904xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439488312DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.07009591042doi7 aPMC19648552pmcid7 a175510152pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChung, Hoi Sung10aTransient 2D IR spectroscopy of ubiquitin unfolding dynamics  ap. 14237-14242.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aTransient two-dimensional infrared (2D IR) spectroscopy is used as a probe of protein unfolding dynamics in a direct comparison of fast unfolding experiments with molecular dynamics simulations. In the experiments, the unfolding of ubiquitin is initiated by a laser temperature jump, and protein structural evolution from nanoseconds to milliseconds is probed using amide I 2D IR spectroscopy. The temperature jump prepares a subensemble near the unfolding transition state, leading to quasi-barrierless unfolding (the "burst phase") before the millisecond activated unfolding kinetics. The burst phase unfolding of ubiquitin is characterized by a loss of the coupling between vibrations of the β-sheet, a process that manifests itself in the 2D IR spectrum as a frequency blue-shift and intensity decrease of the diagonal and cross-peaks of the sheet's two IR active modes. As the sheet unfolds, increased fluctuations and solvent exposure of the β-sheet amide groups are also characterized by increases in homogeneous linewidth. Experimental spectra are compared with 2D IR spectra calculated from the time-evolving structures in a molecular dynamics simulation of ubiquitin unfolding. Unfolding is described as a sequential unfolding of strands in ubiquitin's β-sheet, using two collective coordinates of the sheet: (i) the native interstrand contacts between adjacent β-strands I and II and (ii) the remaining β-strand contacts within the sheet. The methods used illustrate the general principles by which 2D IR spectroscopy can be used for detailed dynamical comparisons of experiment and simulation.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3ainfrared spectroscopy 3amolecular dynamics 3aprotein unfolding 3asolvents 3astructural proteins 3atemperature 3aubiquitin1 aGanim, Ziad1 aJones, K.

Here, we examine the influence of anthropogenic habitat changes on traits typically associated with natural and sexual selection in the little greenbul (Andropadus virens), an African rainforest bird species. Using satellite remote-sensing and field survey data, we classified habitats into nonhuman-altered mature and human-altered secondary forest. Mature rainforest consisted of pristine rainforest, with little or no human influence, and secondary forest was characterized by plantations of coffee and cacao and high human impacts. Andropadus virens abundance was higher in secondary forest, and populations inhabiting mature rainforest were significantly larger in wing and tarsus length and bill size; characters often correlated with fitness. To assess the extent to which characters important in sexual section and mate choice might be influenced by habitat change, we also examined differences in plumage colour and song. Plumage colour and the variance in plumage luminance were found to differ between forest types, and song duration was found to be significantly longer in mature forest. The possible adaptive significance of these differences in traits is discussed. Despite relatively high levels of gene flow across habitats, amplified fragment length polymorphism analysis revealed that a small proportion of high-FST loci differentiated mature from secondary forest populations. These loci were significant outliers against neutral expectations in a simulation analysis, suggesting a role for divergent selection in differentiation across habitats. A distance-based redundancy analysis further showed that forest type as defined by remote-sensing variables was significantly associated with genetic dissimilarities between habitats, even when controlling for distance. The observed shifts in morphology, plumage and song were consistent with divergent selection on heritable variation, but a role for plasticity cannot be ruled out. Results suggest that anthropogenic habitat changes may have evolutionary consequences, with implications for conservation and restoration. 3aamplified fragment length polymorphism 3aanthropogenic activities 3abiodiversity 3abirds 3acolor 3aforest types 3agene flow 3ahabitats 3ahumans 3aloci 3amating behavior 3aplantations 3aplumage 3arain forests 3aremote sensing 3asecondary forests 3asexual selection 3asurveys 3avariance 2aAmplified Fragment Length Polymorphism Analysis 2aAnalysis of Variance 2aAnimal Communication 2aAnimals 2aAnklexanatomy & histology 2aBeakxanatomy & histology 2aBiological Evolution 2aBody Size 2aEcosystem 2aGenetic Variation 2aHuman Activities 2aPasseriformesxanatomy & histologyxgenetics. 2aPigmentationxphysiology 2aPopulation Density 2aPrincipal Component Analysis 2aSelection, Genetic 2aTrees 2aWingxanatomy & histology 3aCentral Africa 0aCameroon 0aEquatorial Guinea 0agenetic structure 0ahuman disturbance 0aplumage divergence 0arainforest diversification 0asong divergence1 aMILÁ, BORJA1 aGRETHER, GREGORY F.1 aSLABBEKOORN, HANS1 aSEPIL, IREM1 aBUERMANN, WOLFGANG1 aSaatchi, Sasan.1 aPOLLINGER, JOHN P.0 tMolecular ecology.g2008 Jan., v. 17, no. 1 p.58-71dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0962-10837nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-294X.2007.03478.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20071223b20080102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03382naa a2200601 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100001800184245008200202300002000284500001500304506007600319520158800395506003701983650001802020650001602038650002102054650001602075650001502091650001702106650001602123650002602139650000902165650001202174650001602186650001002202650001202212653001002224700001502234700002002249700001602269700001802285700001702303700001602320700001602336700001702352700001902369700001602388700001402404700001402418700002202432773017602454852000902630856008302639930003302722946001302755655001202768IND4393626720221207134328.0070729e20070724xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439362672DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.07055021042doi7 aPMC19247922pmcid7 a176409032pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Dongmei10aEfficient genome-wide mutagenesis of zebrafish genes by retroviral insertions  ap. 12428-12433.  a2019-12-04  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aUsing a combination of techniques we developed, we infected zebrafish embryos using pseudotyped retroviruses and mapped the genomic locations of the proviral integrations in the F₁ offspring of the infected fish. From F₁ fish, we obtained 2,045 sequences representing 933 unique retroviral integrations. A total of 599 were mappable to the current genomic assembly (Zv6), and 233 of the integrations landed within genes. By inbreeding fish carrying proviral integrations in 25 different genes, we were able to demonstrate that in [almost equal to]50% of the gene "hits," the mRNA transcript levels were reduced by >=70%, with the highest probability for mutation occurring if the integration was in an exon or first intron. Based on these data, the mutagenic frequency for the retrovirus is nearly one in five integrations. In addition, a strong mutagenic effect is seen when murine leukemia virus integrates specifically in the first intron of genes but not in other introns. Three of 19 gene inactivation events had embryonic defects. Using the strategy we outlined, it is possible to identify 1 mutagenic event for every 30 sequencing reactions done on the F₁ fish. This is a 20- to 30-fold increase in efficiency when compared with the current resequencing approach [targeting induced local lesions in genomes (TILLING)] used in zebrafish for identifying mutations in genes. Combining this increase in efficiency with cryopreservation of sperm samples from the F₁ fish, it is now possible to create a stable resource that contains mutations in every known zebrafish gene.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3amessenger RNA 3aprobability 3acryopreservation 3amutagenesis 3ainbreeding 3amutagenicity 3aspermatozoa 3aMurine leukemia virus 3afish 3aprogeny 3aDanio rerio 3aexons 3aintrons 0agenes1 aJao, Li-En1 aZheng, Naizhong1 aDolan, Kyle1 aIvey, Jessica1 aZonies, Seth1 aWu, Xiaolin1 aWu, Kangmai1 aYang, Hongbo1 aMeng, Qingchao1 aZhu, Zuoyan1 aZhang, Bo1 aLin, Shuo1 aBurgess, Shawn M.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2007 July 24, v. 104, no. 30 p.12428-12433dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.07055021043Available from publisher's Web site  a20070729b20070802c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle04119naa a2200637 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100001900171245012000190300001600310520208100326650002502407650002202432650001202454650001702466650002802483650001002511650001402521650002202535650001902557650002102576650001502597650002002612650002402632650001302656650003702669650005202706650002502758650001502783650001902798650002402817650002202841650001402863650002402877650003702901650002402938650003402962650004702996650002403043650002403067653002403091653002103115653002403136653003303160700001703193773011403210852000903324856009203333930003303425946001103458655001203469IND4399350220221120054543.0071223e200801  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439935022DNAL7 a179082132pmid7 a10.1111/j.1365-294X.2007.03538.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDLUGOSCH, K.M.10aFounding events in species invasions: genetic variation, adaptive evolution, and the role of multiple introductions  ap. 431-449.  aInvasive species are predicted to suffer from reductions in genetic diversity during founding events, reducing adaptive potential. Integrating evidence from two literature reviews and two case studies, we address the following questions: How much genetic diversity is lost in invasions? Do multiple introductions ameliorate this loss? Is there evidence for loss of diversity in quantitative traits? Do invaders that have experienced strong bottlenecks show adaptive evolution? How do multiple introductions influence adaptation on a landscape scale? We reviewed studies of 80 species of animals, plants, and fungi that quantified nuclear molecular diversity within introduced and source populations. Overall, there were significant losses of both allelic richness and heterozygosity in introduced populations, and large gains in diversity were rare. Evidence for multiple introductions was associated with increased diversity, and allelic variation appeared to increase over long timescales (~100 years), suggesting a role for gene flow in augmenting diversity over the long-term. We then reviewed the literature on quantitative trait diversity and found that broad-sense variation rarely declines in introductions, but direct comparisons of additive variance were lacking. Our studies of Hypericum canariense invasions illustrate how populations with diminished diversity may still evolve rapidly. Given the prevalence of genetic bottlenecks in successful invading populations and the potential for adaptive evolution in quantitative traits, we suggest that the disadvantages associated with founding events may have been overstated. However, our work on the successful invader Verbascum thapsus illustrates how multiple introductions may take time to commingle, instead persisting as a 'mosaic of maladaptation' where traits are not distributed in a pattern consistent with adaptation. We conclude that management limiting gene flow among introduced populations may reduce adaptive potential but is unlikely to prevent expansion or the evolution of novel invasive behaviour. 3aHypericum canariense 3aVerbascum thapsus 3aanimals 3acase studies 3aevolutionary adaptation 3afungi 3agene flow 3agenetic variation 3aheterozygosity 3ainvasive species 3alandscapes 3aplants (botany) 3aquantitative traits 3avariance 2aAdaptation, Biologicalxgenetics 2aAmplified Fragment Length Polymorphism Analysis 2aBiological Evolution 2aDemography 2aFounder Effect 2aGene Flowxgenetics 2aGenetic Variation 2aGeography 2aHypericumxgenetics 2aMicrosatellite Repeatsxgenetics 2aPopulation Dynamics 2aQuantitative Trait, Heritable 2aRandom Amplified Polymorphic DNA Technique 2aSpecies Specificity 2aVerbascumxgenetics 0agenetic bottlenecks 0alocal adaptation 0amolecular diversity 0aquantitative trait evolution1 aPARKER, I.M.0 tMolecular ecology.g2008 Jan., v. 17, no. 1 p.431-449dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0962-10837nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-294X.2007.03538.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20071223b20080102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02571naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245017800127300001400305500002400319500001500343520128900358650002101647650002101668650001701689650001301706650001601719650002301735650001301758650002801771650001001799650002501809651001101834653001001845653001101855700001501866773011701881852000901998856008502007930003302092945001302125946001102138655001202149IND2202148120221120054608.0000104e199905  ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220214812DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKatterer, T.10aGrowth dynamics of reed canarygrass (Phalaris arundinacea L.) and its allocation of biomass and nitrogen below ground in a field receiving daily irrigation and fertilisation  ap. 21-29.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aBiomass and nitrogen in the roots, rhizomes, stem bases and litter of reed canarygrass (Phalaris arundinacea L.) were repeatedly estimated by soil coring, and root growth dynamics of this potential energy crop was studied for two years using minirhizotrons. Results are discussed in relation to above-ground biomass and nitrogen fertilisation. Five treatments were used: C(0), unfertilised control; C(1), fertilised with solid N fertiliser in spring; I(1), irrigated daily, fertilised as in C(1); IF(1), irrigated as I(1) and fertilised daily through a drip-tube system; IF(2), as in IF(1) but with higher N fertiliser rates. Biomass of below-ground plant parts of reed canarygass increased between the first and second years. Up 50% of total plant biomass and nitrogen were recovered below-ground. The highest proportions were found in C(0). The calculated annual input via root turnover ranged between 80 and 235 g m(-2). In absolute terms, up to 1 kg and 10 g m(-2) of biomass and nitrogen, respectively, were found in below-ground plant fractions. High inputs of stubble and accumulated below-ground biomass will occur when the ley is ploughed, which will result in a highly positive soil carbon balance for this crop in comparison with that of conventional crops such as cereals. 3anitrogen content 3aapplication rate 3aplant litter 3anitrogen 3afertigation 3abiomass production 3arhizomes 3adry matter partitioning 3aroots 3aPhalaris arundinacea 3aSweden 0astems 0agrowth1 aAndren, O.0 tNutrient cycling in agroecosystems.g1999 May, v. 54, no. 1 p.21-29dKluwer Academic Publishersx1385-13147nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.wkap.nl/kapis/CGI-BIN/WORLD/jrnltoc.htm?1385-13143Tables of contents  a20000302b20000309c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US 7aarticle03875naa a2200661 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100001900184245010800203300002000311506007600331520175000407506003702157650001402194650001602208650001702224650002602241650002202267650003502289650001702324650001202341650001802353650001402371650001902385650002802404650001402432650002202446650000902468650001002477650002902487650001702516650001302533650005002546650004002596700002102636700002302657700001902680700001602699700001602715700002202731700001802753700002302771700002002794700002302814700002602837700002402863773017602887852000903063856008303072930003303155946001303188655001203201IND4394886720221207134328.0070909e20070904xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439488672DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.07035771042doi7 aPMC19648502pmcid7 a177261042pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAdvani, Andrew10aRole of VEGF in maintaining renal structure and function under normotensive and hypertensive conditions  ap. 14448-14453.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aInhibiting the actions of VEGF is a new therapeutic paradigm in cancer management with antiangiogenic therapy also under intensive investigation in a range of nonmalignant diseases characterized by pathological angiogenesis. However, the effects of VEGF inhibition on organs that constitutively express it in adulthood, such as the kidney, are mostly unknown. Accordingly, we examined the effect of VEGF inhibition on renal structure and function under physiological conditions and in the setting of the common renal stressors: hypertension and activation of the renin-angiotensin system. When compared with normotensive Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats, glomerular VEGF mRNA was increased 2-fold in transgenic (mRen-2)27 rats that overexpress renin with spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR) kidneys showing VEGF expression levels that were intermediate between them. Administration of either an orally active inhibitor of the type 2 VEGF receptor (VEGFR-2) tyrosine kinase or a VEGF neutralizing antibody to TGR(mRen-2)27 rats resulted in loss of glomerular endothelial cells and transformation to a malignant hypertensive phenotype with severe glomerulosclerosis. VEGFR-2 kinase inhibition treatment was well tolerated in SDs and SHRs; although even in these animals there was detectable endothelial cell loss and rise in albuminuria. Mild mesangial expansion was also noted in hypertensive SHR, but not in SD rats. These studies illustrate: (i) VEGF has a role in the maintenance of glomerular endothelial integrity under physiological circumstances, (ii) glomerular VEGF is increased in response to hypertension and activation of the renin-angiotensin system, and (iii) VEGF signaling plays a protective role in the setting of these renal stressors.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aadulthood 3aalbuminuria 3aangiogenesis 3aanimal disease models 3aendothelial cells 3agenetically modified organisms 3ahypertension 3akidneys 3amessenger RNA 3aneoplasms 3aneutralization 3aneutralizing antibodies 3aphenotype 3aprotective effect 3arats 3arenin 3arenin-angiotensin system 3atherapeutics 3atyrosine 3avascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2 3avascular endothelial growth factors1 aKelly, Darren J.1 aAdvani, Suzanne L.1 aCox, Alison J.1 aThai, Kerri1 aZhang, Yuan1 aWhite, Kathryn E.1 aGow, Renae M.1 aMarshall, Sally M.1 aSteer, Brent M.1 aMarsden, Philip A.1 aRakoczy, P.

In addition, recent studies showed deregulation of some of Eph/ephrin genes in human malignancies, suggesting the involvement of this signaling pathway in tumorigenesis. The ALL1 (also termed MLL) gene on human chromosome 11q23 was isolated by virtue of its involvement in recurrent chromosome translocations associated with acute leukemias with poor prognosis. The translocations fuse ALL1 to any of >50 partner genes and result in production of chimeric proteins composed of the ALL1 N terminus and the C terminus of the partner protein. The most common translocations in ALL1-associated leukemias are t(4;11) and t(9;11), which generate ALL1/AF4 and ALL1/AF9 fusion protein, respectively. In the present study, we sought to determine whether ALL1 fusion proteins are involved in regulation of Eph/ephrin genes. Screening of K562 cells producing recombinant ALL1/AF4 or ALL1/AF9 fusion protein revealed transcriptional up-regulation of the EphA7. Consistent with this finding, siRNA-mediated suppression of ALL1/AF4 in SEMK2 cells carrying the t(4;11) chromosome translocation resulted in down-regulation of EphA7. ChIP analysis demonstrated the occupancy of tagged ALL1 fusion proteins on the EphA7 promoter, pointing to EphA7 as a direct target of the formers. Further studies demonstrate that EphA7 up-regulation is accompanied by ERK phosphorylation. Finally, we show apoptotic cell death, specific for leukemic cells carrying the t(4;11) chromosome translocation, after treatment of the cells with an ERK phosphorylation blocker.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aapoptosis 3acarcinogenesis 3achromosome translocation 3achromosomes 3agenes 3ahumans 3aligands 3amitogen-activated protein kinase 3aphosphorylation 3aprognosis 3areceptor protein-tyrosine kinase 3arecombinant fusion proteins 3ascreening 3asignal transduction 3atranscription (genetics)1 aNakamura, Tatsuya1 aCanaani, Eli1 aCroce, Carlo M.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2007 Sept. 4, v. 104, no. 36 p.14442-14447dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.07032111043Available from publisher's Web site  a20070909b20071002c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02689naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100002800184245006400212300002000276506007600296520113400372506003701506650001401543650002301557650002001580650001201600650001701612650003901629650002801668650001501696650001901711700002001730700001901750700001801769700001801787700002201805700002701827700002001854700001901874773017601893852000902069856008302078930003302161946001302194655001202207IND4393809720221207135409.0070805e20070731xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439380972DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.06107551042doi7 aPMC19375132pmcid7 a176644332pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRoeffaers, Maarten B.J.10aSingle-molecule fluorescence spectroscopy in (bio)catalysis  ap. 12603-12609.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe ever-improving time and space resolution and molecular detection sensitivity of fluorescence microscopy offer unique opportunities to deepen our insights into the function of chemical and biological catalysts. Because single-molecule microscopy allows for counting the turnover events one by one, one can map the distribution of the catalytic activities of different sites in solid heterogeneous catalysts, or one can study time-dependent activity fluctuations of individual sites in enzymes or chemical catalysts. By experimentally monitoring individuals rather than populations, the origin of complex behavior, e.g., in kinetics or in deactivation processes, can be successfully elucidated. Recent progress of temporal and spatial resolution in single-molecule fluorescence microscopy is discussed in light of its impact on catalytic assays. Key concepts are illustrated regarding the use of fluorescent reporters in catalytic reactions. Future challenges comprising the integration of other techniques, such as diffraction, scanning probe, or vibrational methods in single-molecule fluorescence spectroscopy are suggested.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3adetection limit 3aenzymes 3afluorescence 3afluorescence emission spectroscopy 3afluorescence microscopy 3amonitoring 3aspace and time1 aDe Cremer, Gert1 aUji-i, Hiroshi1 aMuls, Benîot1 aSels, Bert F.1 aJacobs, Pierre A.1 aSchryver, Frans C. de.1 aDe Vos, Dirk E.1 aHofkens, Johan0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2007 July 31, v. 104, no. 31 p.12603-12609dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.06107551043Available from publisher's Web site  a20070805b20070902c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle04434naa a2200793 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024003900133040001800172072000900190072000900199072000900208100001800217245014000235300001600375500002400391506007600415520185900491506003702350650002402387650001102411650003502422650001802457650002102475650001902496650002602515650002002541650001702561650001502578650001502593650002102608650002902629650002802658650001302686650002002699650003602719650001802755650002202773650004302795650003802838650002502876650003502901650004102936650003402977650001103011650003003022650001703052650003103069650002003100650003703120650002903157650005603186650002603242653002303268700002703291700001303318700001603331700001703347773011103364852000903475856007303484930003303557945002503590946001303615655001203628IND4380717220221207135352.0060607e200604  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438071722DNAL7 a161094822pmid7 aPMC14732192pmcid7 a10.1016/j.jnutbio.2005.05.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aT300 0aT200 0aX3801 aGriffin, J.B.10aBiotin supplementation decreases the expression of the SERCA3 gene (ATP2A3) in Jurkat cells, thus, triggering unfolded protein response  ap. 272-281.  aIncludes references  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aProtein folding in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) depends on Ca2+; uptake of Ca2+ into the ER is mediated by sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase 3 (SERCA3). The 5'-flanking region of the SERCA3 gene (ATP2A3) contains numerous binding sites for the transcription factors Sp1 and Sp3. Biotin affects the nuclear abundance of Sp1 and Sp3, which may act as transcriptional activators or repressors. Here we determined whether biotin affects the expression of the SERCA3 gene and, thus, protein folding in human lymphoid cells. Jurkat cells were cultured in media containing 0.025 nmol/L biotin (denoted “deficient”) or 10 nmol/L biotin (“supplemented”). The transcriptional activity of the full-length human SERCA3 promoter was 50% lower in biotin-supplemented cells compared to biotin-deficient cells. Biotin-dependent repressors bind to elements located 731-1312 bp upstream from the transcription start site in the SERCA3 gene. The following suggest that low expression of SERCA3 in biotin-supplemented cells impaired folding of secretory proteins in the ER, triggering unfolded protein response: (i) sequestration of Ca2+ in the ER decreased by 14-24% in response to biotin supplementation; (ii) secretion of interleukin-2 into the extracellular space decreased by 75% in response to biotin supplementation; (iii) the nuclear abundance of stress-induced transcription factors increased in response to biotin supplementation; and (iv) the abundance of stress-related proteins such ubiquitin activating enzyme 1, growth arrest and DNA damage 153 gene, X-box binding protein 1 and phosphorylated eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2α increased in response to biotin supplementation. Collectively, this study suggests that supplements containing pharmacological doses of biotin may cause cell stress by impairing protein folding in the ER.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3avitamin supplements 3abiotin 3anutrition-genotype interaction 3ainterleukin-2 3acalcium channels 3acarboxy-lyases 3aendoplasmic reticulum 3aprotein folding 3acytotoxicity 3aDNA damage 3acell cycle 3aoxidative stress 3aubiquitin-protein ligase 3aprotein phosphorylation 3amegadose 3aadverse effects 2aBiotinxadministration & dosage 2aBiotinylation 2aCalciumxanalysis 2aCalcium-Transporting ATPasesxgenetics 2aCarbon-Carbon Ligasesxmetabolism 2aCytoplasmxchemistry 2aDNA-Binding Proteinsxgenetics 2aElectrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay 2aGene Expressionxdrug effects 2aHumans 2aInterleukin-2xsecretion. 2aJurkat Cells 2aNuclear Proteinsxgenetics 2aProtein Folding 2aPyruvate Carboxylasexmetabolism 2aRNA, Messengerxanalysis 2aSarcoplasmic Reticulum Calcium-Transporting ATPases 2aTranscription Factors 0ahuman jurkat cells1 aRodriguez-Melendez, R.1 aDode, L.1 aWuytack, F.1 aZempleni, J.0 tJournal of nutritional biochemistry.g2006 Apr., v. 17, no. 4 p.272-281dElsevier Sciencex0955-28637nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jnutbio.2005.05.0053electronic resource  a20060809b20060906c00000000  aINDdPNNe2006/08/09  aOther US 7aarticle03080naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100002100184245007500205300002000280506007600300520159400376506003701970650001302007650001402020650002602034650002302060650001402083650000902097650002302106650001102129650001402140650001102154650001402165650000902179651001502188700002202203700002102225700001602246700002202262773017602284852000902460856008302469930003302552946001302585655001202598IND4394885420221207135348.0070909e20070904xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439488542DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.07025991042doi7 aPMC19501002pmcid7 a177042542pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRundus, Aaron S.10aGround squirrels use an infrared signal to deter rattlesnake predation  ap. 14372-14376.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe evolution of communicative signals involves a major hurdle; signals need to effectively stimulate the sensory systems of their targets. Therefore, sensory specializations of target animals are important sources of selection on signal structure. Here we report the discovery of an animal signal that uses a previously unknown communicative modality, infrared radiation or "radiant heat," which capitalizes on the infrared sensory capabilities of the signal's target. California ground squirrels (Spermophilus beecheyi) add an infrared component to their snake-directed tail-flagging signals when confronting infrared-sensitive rattlesnakes (Crotalus oreganus), but tail flag without augmenting infrared emission when confronting infrared-insensitive gopher snakes (Pituophis melanoleucus). Experimental playbacks with a biorobotic squirrel model reveal this signal's communicative function. When the infrared component was added to the tail flagging display of the robotic models, rattlesnakes exhibited a greater shift from predatory to defensive behavior than during control trials in which tail flagging included no infrared component. These findings provide exceptionally strong support for the hypothesis that the sensory systems of signal targets should, in general, channel the evolution of signal structure. Furthermore, the discovery of previously undescribed signaling modalities such as infrared radiation should encourage us to overcome our own human-centered sensory biases and more fully examine the form and diversity of signals in the repertoires of many animal species.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aCrotalus 3aPituophis 3aSpermophilus beecheyi 3adefensive behavior 3aevolution 3aheat 3ainfrared radiation 3amodels 3apredation 3arobots 3asquirrels 3atail 3aCalifornia1 aOwings, Donald H.1 aJoshi, Sanjay S.1 aChinn, Erin1 aGiannini, Nicolas0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2007 Sept. 4, v. 104, no. 36 p.14372-14376dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.07025991043Available from publisher's Web site  a20070909b20071002c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle03738naa a2200637 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100002100171245014000192300001800332520178700350650002502137650000802162650001202170650001402182650001402196650001402210650001402224650003102238650001502269650002802284650000902312650002502321650001302346650001602359650002402375650003502399650002502434650002602459650003502485650002302520650002002543650002202563650001302585650001502598650003702613650001402650650002302664650002702687653002402714653001202738653001302750653002302763700001902786700002102805773011702826852000902943856009202952930003303044946001103077655001203088IND4392947820221120041406.0070708e200707  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439294782DNAL7 a176149172pmid7 a10.1111/j.1365-294X.2007.03298.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBROCK, MARCUS T.10aSequence diversity and haplotype associations with phenotypic responses to crowding: GIGANTEA affects fruit set in Arabidopsis thaliana  ap. 3050-3062.  aIdentifying the molecular genetic basis of intraspecific variation in quantitative traits promises to provide novel insight into their evolutionary history as well as genetic mechanisms of adaptation. In an attempt to identify genes responsible for natural variation in competitive responses in Arabidopsis thaliana, we examined DNA sequence diversity at seven loci previously identified as members of the phytochrome B signalling network. For one gene, GIGANTEA (GI), we detected significant haplotype structure. To test for GI haplogroup-phenotype associations, we genotyped 161 A. thaliana accessions at GI and censused the same accessions for total fruit set and the expression of three phenotypic traits (days to flowering, petiole length, and inflorescence height) in a greenhouse experiment where plants were grown in crowded and uncrowded environments. We detected a significant association between GI and total fruit set that resulted in a 14% difference in average fruit set among GI haplogroups. Given that fruit set is an important component of fitness in this species and given the magnitude of the effect, the question arises as to how variation at this locus is maintained. Our observation of frequent and significant epistasis between GI and background single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP), where the fitness ranking of the GI allele either reverses or does not differ depending on the allele at the interacting SNP, suggests that epistatic selection may actively maintain or at least slow the loss of variation at GI. This result is particularly noteworthy in the light of the ongoing debate regarding the genetic underpinnings of phenotypic evolution and recent observations that epistasis for phenotypic traits and components of fitness is common in A. thaliana. 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3aDNA 3aalleles 3aepistasis 3aevolution 3aflowering 3afruit set 3agreenhouse experimentation 3ahaplotypes 3aintraspecific variation 3aloci 3anucleotide sequences 3apetioles 3aphytochrome 3aquantitative traits 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism 2aAnalysis of Variance 2aArabidopsisxgenetics 2aArabidopsis Proteinsxgenetics 2aEpistasis, Genetic 2aFruitxgenetics 2aGenetic Variation 2aGenotype 2aHaplotypes 2aLinkage Disequilibriumxgenetics 2aPhenotype 2aPopulation Density 2aSequence Analysis, DNA 0aassociation mapping 0afitness 0aGIGANTEA 0asequence diversity1 aTiffin, Peter.1 aWeinig, Cynthia.0 tMolecular ecology.g2007 July, v. 16, no. 14 p.3050-3062dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0962-10837nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-294X.2007.03298.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20070708b20070802c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle01972naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002600145245012000171300001600291520069300307650001701000650001701017650001001034650001801044650001101062650002601073650002901099650001301128650002501141650002601166700002401192700003001216700003101246700002201277700002501299773010001324852000901424856008501433930003301518946001101551655001201562IND4422430520221120024208.0090626e200906  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442243052DNAL7 a10.1365/s10337-008-0913-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDe Souza, Jacqueline 10aLC-UV Methodology for Simultaneous Determination of Lamivudine and Zidovudine in Plasma by Liquid-Liquid Extraction  ap. 231-235.  aThis study describes an accurate, sensitive, and specific chromatographic method for the simultaneous quantitative determination of lamivudine and zidovudine in human blood plasma, using stavudine as an internal standard.

Rain may be intercepted by the canopy, refill the soil pore system, taken up by plant roots or drained. Transpired soil water may be replenished from a shallow water table, so water table loss is indirectly tied to evapotranspiration (ET). The purpose of this study was to use continuous data for the different components of the water cycle to back-calculate Sy for both wetting and drying conditions. Two time periods were considered for a toeslope site in an Iowa corn (Zea mays L.) field: growing season from 22 June to 10 July 2007, and post-growing season 13-30 October 2007. The field was instrumented with eddy covariance instrumentation for ET estimates, tipping bucket raingage for precipitation, automated well-depth recorder for water table depth and water content reflectometers (CS616s) for soil water content. During drying in the growing season, mean Sy was 0·19, but drying Sy could not be determined post-growing season because of no net upward water movement at this time. During wetting, estimates of Sy were improved when soil water increase was subtracted from total rainfall; then the mean wetting Sy was 0·052 versus 0·31-0·46 without this correction. Large differences between seasonal and post-growing season data reflected the seasonal strong upward gradient created by soil dried from water uptake. Post-growing season data was dominated by drainage, but seasonal root water uptake intercepted drainage water.

Hutjes, P. Kabat, B. Bass, C. Field, S.W. Running and W.J. Shuttleworth.  aVarious components of the land surface, their individual hydrological processes and the process-oriented models are reviewed in this paper, with the focus on their application in global climate models (GCMs). The Biosphere-Atmosphere Transfer Scheme (BATS) is examined regarding its performance for three different surfaces (crop, forest and grass), with available data from HAPEX-MOBILHY, ABRACOS and Russian data sets. The simulations of the key land surface prognostic variables, such as soil moisture and snow cover, are examined in detail because such validation has been lacking. Using the HAPEX-MOBILHY data, the impact of errors in the forcing variables on the uncertainties in the partitioning of total run-off and evapotranspiration is investigated, and the influence of the periodic forcing on soil moisture simulations is examined. Furthermore, an alternative empirically based approach for the soil evaporation efficiency is tested. The current framework of BATS soil hydrology, vegetation and snow schemes adequately reproduces observed soil moisture profiles for the three surfaces considered, and captures the seasonal evolution of snow mass. The simulations can be enhanced when site-specific information on surface parameters is available. Because of the realism of the overall framework of BATS, its inclusion in a GCM [the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) Community Climate Model (CCM)] leads to reasonably realistic simulations of surface hydroclimatological variables. Further improving surface hydrology in global climate models is dependent on thorough tests of the available models using the available data, on the collection of long-term, seasonal, high-quality data, both at point and on larger spatial scales, and on the effective representation of the surface types on GCM scales. 3aclimate models 3adata collection 3aevaporation 3aevapotranspiration 3aforests 3agrasses 3arunoff 3asnow 3asnowpack 3asoil water 3auncertainty1 aDickinson, R.E.1 aShuttleworth, W.J.1 aShaikh, M.0 tJournal of hydrology.g1998 Dec., v. 212/213, no. 1/4 p.109-127x0022-16947nnas  aDNAL  a19990702b19990709c00000000  aINDdRF1  aNon-US 7aarticle02682naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001500110245007400125300002000199500012400219500002400343520150700367650001301874650001801887650002101905650001301926650001901939650002601958650002301984650001702007650001502024650001602039650001702055650001702072650001502089650001802104650001802122700001702140773011802157852000902275655001202284IND4372049820221123030957.0050706e200410  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437204982DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCherla, G.10aRole of L-arginine in the pathogenesis and treatment of renal disease  ap. 2801S-2806S.  aPaper presented on Arginine Metabolism: Enzymology, Nutrition, and Clinical Significance held April 5-6, 2004, Bermuda.  aIncludes references  aL-arginine is a semi essential amino acid and also a substrate for the synthesis of nitric oxide (NO), polyamines, and agmatine. These L-arginine metabolites may participate in the pathogenesis of renal disease and constitute the rationale for manipulating L-arginine metabolism as a strategy to ameliorate kidney disease. Modification of dietary L-arginine intake in experimental models of kidney diseases has been shown to have both beneficial as well as deleterious effects depending on the specific model studied. L-arginine supplementation in animal models of glomerulonephritis has been shown to be detrimental, probably by increasing the production of NO from increased local expression of inducible NO synthase (iNOS). L-arginine supplementation does not modify the course of renal disease in humans with chronic glomerular diseases. However, beneficial effects of L-arginine supplementation have been reported in several models of chronic kidney disease including renal ablation, ureteral obstruction, nephropathy secondary to diabetes, and salt-sensitive hypertension. L-arginine is reduced in preeclampsia and recent experimental studies indicate that L-arginine supplementation may be beneficial in attenuating the symptoms of preeclampsia. Administration of exogenous L-arginine has been shown to be protective in ischemic acute renal failure. In summary, the role of L-arginine in the pathogenesis and treatment of renal disease is not completely understood and remains to be established. 3aagmatine 3aanimal models 3achronic diseases 3adiabetes 3adisease models 3aessential amino acids 3aglomerulonephritis 3ahypertension 3ametabolism 3ametabolites 3anitric oxide 3apathogenesis 3apolyamines 3apre-eclampsia 3arenal failure1 aJaimes, E.A.0 tJournal of nutrition.g2004 Oct., v. 134, no. 10S p.2801S-2806SdAmerican Institute of Nutritionx0022-31667nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle02338naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002500110245008700135300001600222500016300238520116800401650001501569650001901584650001401603650001501617650001901632650002201651650001701673650002401690650001801714650001501732700001601747700001701763700002101780773008501801852000901886930003301895945001301928946001101941655001201952IND2198821520221123031115.0990520e199812  ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND219882152DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBastiaanssen, W.G.M.12aA remote sensing surface energy balance algorithm for land (SEBAL). 1.

The relationship between visible and thermal infrared spectral radiances of areas with a sufficiently large hydrological contrast (dry and wet land surface types, vegetative cover is not essential) constitute the basis for the formulation of the new Surface Energy Balance Algorithm for Land (SEBAL). The new algorithm (i) estimates the spatial variation of most essential hydro-meteorological parameters empirically, (ii) requires only field information on short wave atmospheric transmittance, surface temperature and vegetation height, (iii) does not involve numerical simulation models, (iv) calculates the fluxes independently from land cover and (v) can handle thermal infrared images at resolutions between a few meters to a few kilometers. The empirical relationships are adjusted to different geographical regions and time of image acquisition. Actual satellite data is inserted in the derivation of the regression coefficients.

Plant fresh weight, plant dry weight, shoot number and phenolic excretion to the culture medium were recorded during shoot formation. Shoot number increased for 30 days of culture but formation of new shoots was greatly reduced from 31 to 40 days. Phenolic excretion also increased during the first 20 days of culture (gallic acid represented 82% total phenolics) and decreased during the last 10 days (31-40 days of culture). The most intensive period of phenolic excretion (11-20 days) preceded the most intensive period of shoot formation (21-30 days). The same relationship does not seem to exist between the accumulation of fresh and dry weights. Subculture onto fresh medium at the beginning of proliferation (10 days after culture initiation) was detrimental to shoot formation in the subsequent period (11-20 days). However, such a detrimental effect could be avoided if gallic acid was added to the medium. Addition of cysteine to the culture medium reduced both excretion of phenolics and shoot formation but not fresh weight. The use of temporary immersion systems, the increase of culture medium volume per initial explant and the addition of paclobutrazol promoted both phenolic excretion and sugarcane shoot formation. Results presented here indicate a relationship between phenolic excretion and shoot formation but not with accumulation of plant weight. 3aplant secretions and exudates 3aquantitative analysis 3acell growth 3aSaccharum 3ashoots 3aexplants 3aphenolic compounds 3amicropropagation 3aculture media 3acysteine 3aorganogenesis 0ain vitro culture 0aregulation1 aBlanco, M. de los A.1 aPelaez, O.1 aGonzalez, A.1 aCid, M.1 aIglesias, A.1 aGonzalez, B.1 aEscalona, M.1 aEspinosa, P.1 aBorroto, C.0 tPlant cell, tissue, and organ culture.g2001, v. 65, no. 1 p.1-8x0167-68577nnas  aDNAL  a20010903b20010910c00000000  aINDdMKS  aNon-US 7aarticle03184naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100002300171245017500194300001600369500002400385520135200409650000801761650002601769650001301795650001201808650001101820650002301831650001901854650002301873650001901896650001001915650001001925650001501935650001601950650001201966650002401978650002302002650004602025650003502071650004202106650002102148650007202169650003802241650001302279650005502292700002102347700002402368700002602392700002602418773011002444852000902554856005502563655001202618IND4400566020221123031001.0080127e200803  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440056602DNAL7 a182373042pmid7 a10.1111/j.1462-2920.2007.01491.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBalestrino, Damien14aThe characterization of functions involved in the establishment and maturation of Klebsiella pneumoniae in vitro biofilm reveals dual roles for surface exopolysaccharides  ap. 685-701.  aIncludes references  aThe ability to form biofilm is seen as an increasingly important colonization strategy among both pathogenic and environmental Klebsiella pneumoniae strains. The aim of the present study was to identify abiotic surface colonization factors of K. pneumoniae using different models at different phases of biofilm development. A 2200 K. pneumoniae mutant library previously obtained by signature-tagged mutagenesis was screened in static and dynamic culture models to detect clones impaired at early and/or mature stages of biofilm formation. A total of 28 mutants were affected during late phases of biofilm formation, whereas 16 mutants displayed early adhesion defect. These mutants corresponded to genes involved in potential cellular and DNA metabolism pathways and to membrane transport functions. Eight mutants were deficient in capsule or LPS production. Gene disruption and microscopic analyses showed that LPS is involved in initial adhesion on both glass and polyvinyl-chloride and the capsule required for the appropriate initial coverage of substratum and the construction of mature biofilm architecture. These results give new insight into the bacterial factors sequentially associated with the ability to colonize an abiotic surface and reveal the dual roles played by surface exopolysaccharides during K. pneumoniae biofilm formation. 3aDNA 3aKlebsiella pneumoniae 3aadhesion 3abiofilm 3aclones 3acolonizing ability 3adynamic models 3aexopolysaccharides 3agene targeting 3agenes 3aglass 3ametabolism 3amutagenesis 3amutants 2aAdhesins, Bacterial 2aBacterial Adhesion 2aBacterial Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aBiofilmsxgrowth & development 2aGene Expression Regulation, Bacterial 2aGenes, Bacterial 2aKlebsiella pneumoniaexchemistryxgeneticsxmetabolismxphysiology. 2aMutagenesis, Insertionalxmethods 2aMutation 2aPolysaccharides, Bacterialxchemistryxphysiology.1 aGhigo, Jean-Marc1 aCharbonnel, Nicolas1 aHaagensen, Janus A.J.1 aForestier, Christiane0 tEnvironmental microbiology.g2008 Mar., v. 10, no. 3 p.685-701dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx1462-29127nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1462-2920.2007.01491.x 7aarticle02467naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001300110245008200123300001600205520154800221650001401769650002201783650001901805650001501824650002401839650001601863650001801879650001701897650001601914650001501930700002401945773008201969852000902051930003302060945001302093946001102106655001202117IND2196979920221123014247.0990212e199809  ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND219697992DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRuan, H.12aA model to couple overland flow and infiltration into macroporous vadose zone  ap. 116-127.  aMost vegetated land surfaces contain macropores that may have a significant effect on the rate of infiltration of water under ponded conditions on the ground surface. Owing to the small-scale variations of the land topography (microtopography), only portions of the land area may get ponded during the process of overland flow. As the macropores transmit water at much higher rates than the primary soil matrix, higher macropore activation in ponded areas produces larger effective infiltration rates into the soil. Therefore, overland flow and infiltration into the macroporous vadose zone are interrelated. Representing the microtopographic variation of the land surface by a simple sine wave function, a method was developed to relate the ponding area to the average ponding depth which was determined by overland flow. A numerical model coupling overland flow and infiltration into the macroporous vadose zone was developed. Overland flow was simulated using the St. Venant equations with the inertia terms neglected. A single macropore model was used to simulate the infiltration into the macroporous vadose zone. The interaction between overland flow and the infiltration into the macroporous vadose zone was analyzed for a hypothetical watershed. The sensitivity analysis revealed that the interaction of macropore flow and overland flow is significant. For the conditions tested, the macropore flow and the overland flow were found to be more sensitive to the macroporosity and less sensitive to the microtopographic surface variation. 3aequations 3ainfiltration rate 3amacropore flow 3amacropores 3amathematical models 3amicrorelief 3aoverland flow 3aporous media 3avadose zone 3awatersheds1 aIllangasekare, T.H.0 tJournal of hydrology.g1998 Sept., v. 210, no. 1/4 p.116-127x0022-16947nnas  aDNAL  a19990301b19990308c00000000  aINDdRF1  aNon-US 7aarticle03750naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245007500126300001600201500016300217520218800380650002202568650002602590650001902616650001902635650001202654650002002666650001402686650002002700650001402720650002402734650001002758650001502768650001102783650001302794650001502807650001902822650001102841650001102852650001602863650001102879651001202890700001902902700002502921700001802946700002002964700001702984700001503001700001703016773008503033852000903118930003303127945001303160946001103173655001203184IND2198821020221123014423.0990520e199812  ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND219882102DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHalldin, S.10aNOPEX--a northern hemisphere climate processes land surface experiment  ap. 172-187.  aIn the special issue: Biospheric aspects of the hydrological cycle / edited by R.W.A.

Boreal forests play an important, but not well known, role in the global hydrological and biogeochemical cycles. NOPEX (a NOrthern hemisphere climate Processes land surface EXperiment) is devoted to the study of land surface-atmosphere interaction in a northern European forest-dominated landscape. The main NOPEX region represents the southern edge of the boreal zone. It consists of a highly heterogeneous landscape, with forests, mires, agricultural land and lakes. A second study site, in northern Finland, representing the northern edge of the boreal zone, will be introduced into NOPEX in connection with its coming winter-time field activities. Field activities, dominating the initial phase of NOPEX, are conceived to strike a balance between the need to cover multi-annual observations and the resources required to carry out measurements covering all relevant spatial scales. The long-term data collection activities. the Continuous Climate Monitoring (CCM), form the backbone of the field programme. A suite of Concentrated Field Efforts (CFEs) covering periods of summer, spring and winter brings together scientists from more then 20 countries during month-long campaigns. CFEs have been carried out in May-June 1994 and April-July 1995. A third, winter-time CFE is planned for 1998-99. The System for Information in NOPEX (SINOP) is the database which forms a backbone for modelling and analysis work, dominating the second stage of NOPEX. A series of PhD courses are run in parallel to the research activities. Analysis and modelling are done in four interacting areas, including local-scale processes, meso-scale surface-atmosphere coupling and remote sensing techniques. The fourth area, regionalization methods, aims at bringing the previous three together in order to provide improved parameterization schemes for exchange of energy, momentum, water and CO2 between land and atmosphere in hydrological and meteorological models from the meso to the global scale. 3aagricultural land 3abiogeochemical cycles 3aboreal forests 3acarbon dioxide 3aclimate 3adata collection 3adatabases 3aenergy transfer 3ahydrology 3ainformation systems 3alakes 3alandscapes 3amodels 3amomentum 3amonitoring 3aremote sensing 3aspring 3asummer 3auncertainty 3awinter 3aFinland1 aGottschalk, L.1 aGriend, A.A. van de.1 aGryning, S.E.1 aHeikinheimo, M.1 aHogstrom, U.1 aJochum, A.1 aLundin, L.C.0 tJournal of hydrology.g1998 Dec., v. 212/213, no. 1/4 p.172-187x0022-16947nnas  aDNAL  a19990702b19990709c00000000  aINDdRF1  aNon-US 7aarticle03205naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001400110245013300124300001500257520220800272650001402480650001602494650001802510650001402528650001502542650001602557650000902573650002402582650001802606650001702624650001602641700001302657700001402670773008102684852000902765930003302774945001302807946001102820655001202831IND2196979720221123014309.0990212e199809  ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND219697972DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aQiu, G.Y.13aAn improved methodology to measure evaporation from bare soil based on comparison of surface temperature with a dry soil surface  ap. 93-105.  aAccurate estimation of the resistances to water vapor movement is a major difficulty in evaluating evaporation from soil. By including the temperature of a dry soil surface (the temperature of the surface of a dry soil column buried in the field), a method for estimating evaporation from soil is proposed. The necessary input variables for the suggested method are temperature, net radiation, and soil heat flux. There are three advantages of the proposed method over the conventional methods. First, soil surface resistance and aerodynamic resistance are not required. Second, the variables included are fewer. Third, measurement and analysis of the parameters involved are relatively easy. Sensitivity analysis shows that the suggested method is sensitive to temperatures. Test experiments were conducted in a sandy field, where a weighing lysimeter was installed. Evaporation from soil, together with the variables specified above, were measured. For temperatures measured by thermocouples, experimental results showed that the mean absolute error (MAE) for the daily evaporation over 22 days was 0.17 mm day-l. The regression between calculated and measured evaporation was highly significant (r2 = 0.89). Moreover, the intercept and slope of the regression equation were not significantly different from zero and unity, respectively, at the 0.05 probability level. Furthermore, by using the temperatures measured by infrared thermometers, the MAE between measured evaporation and estimated evaporation was 0.15 mm day-l. The regression between them was highly significant (r2 = 0.94). In addition, the intercept and slope of the regression equation were not significantly different from zero and unity, respectively, at the 0.05 probability level. These results show that evaporation calculated using the proposed method is in good agreement with lysimeter measured values. By comparing with the temperature difference method, it was shown that the suggested method estimated soil evaporation more accurately than the temperature difference method. Therefore, it is concluded that the proposed method is not only a simple way for application, but also an accurate way to estimate soil evaporation. 3aequations 3aevaporation 3aheat transfer 3ahydrology 3alysimeters 3aprobability 3asoil 3asurface temperature 3athermocouples 3athermometers 3awater vapor1 aYano, T.1 aMomii, K.0 tJournal of hydrology.g1998 Sept., v. 210, no. 1/4 p.93-105x0022-16947nnas  aDNAL  a19990301b19990308c00000000  aINDdRF1  aNon-US 7aarticle02003naa a2200313 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100002500171245007500196300001600271500002400287520107100311650001301382650001001395650002201405650001001427650002401437650001601461650002401477650001701501773009501518852000901613856005501622655001201677IND4457415020221123014409.0110429e201105  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445741502DNAL7 a208072442pmid7 a10.1111/j.1745-6584.2010.00747.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKawecki, M. Wojciech12aA Model to Simulate Pumping Tests in Wells with High Loss and Backflow  ap. 445-449.  aIncludes references  aTraditional methods of analyzing pumping tests in single wells fail when the well loss is very high due to a low transmissivity skin. Because of the restricted rate at which water can enter a high loss well from the aquifer, well casing storage becomes a significant factor. Additionally, if a slug of water enters the well from the pump column immediately after the pump is switched off, it has a long-lasting significant effect on the recovering water level in the well because it cannot be absorbed rapidly by the aquifer. A theoretical model is derived here that simulates the water level in a well in these circumstances. In the model, the continuously changing rate of water inflow from the aquifer to the well is approximated by a step function with a finite difference time step. It is demonstrated by a real example that the model can be applied easily to analyze pumping tests, including tests with a varying pumping rate. The analysis confirms suspected high well loss, calculates the unknown rate of backflow, and determines the aquifer's transmissivity. 3aaquifers 3apumps 3asimulation models 3awells 2aComputer Simulation 2aFresh Water 2aModels, Theoretical 2aWater Supply0 tGround water.g2011 May, v. 49, no. 3 p.445-449dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0017-467X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1745-6584.2010.00747.x 7aarticle02166naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001400110245006100124300001400185500001500199520095500214650001401169650002801183650002001211650001801231650001201249650002201261650001101283650001101294650000901305650000901314650001801323650002101341650001601362650002201378650001801400650001901418653001101437653002201448653002101470653001601491700002301507773008801530852000901618930003301627945001301660946001101673655001201684IND2323143520221122234520.0010919s2001    ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232314352DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKodym, A.10aLow-cost alternatives for the micropropagation of banana  ap. 67-71.  a2019-12-05  aA 90% resource cost reduction in tissue culture of banana was achieved by replacing tissue culture grade sucrose and Gelrite in the medium with locally available commercial sugar and a starch/Gelrite mixture and by using sun light instead of artificial light. The micropropagation of Musa 'Grande Naine' by shoot tip culture was used as model. Thirteen commercial sugars from different countries were tested. Best results were achieved using white and light brown sugars with low electrical conductivity. Sugars of cane or sugar beet origin were suitable. Starches of corn or potato could partially substitute for Gelrite and agar. In all experiments, micropropagation rates under natural light conditions were equal to or higher than under the controlled conditions of a growth room with PPFD of 65 micromol m-2 s-1 and a 16-h photoperiod.

The primer pairs were designed using porcine EST sequences allowing amplification of introns. These SNPs were tested for their association with the number of piglets born alive in German Large White sows using a discordant approach. Significant effects (p < 0.001 and p < 0.05, respectively) of intronic SNPs on litter size were found for four genes: mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase 3 (MAP3K3), vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (KDR), erbb2 interacting protein (ERBB2IP) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor delta (PPARD). These SNPs can be further tested in upcoming association studies for their influence on litter size in different breeds using larger sample sizes. 3apiglets 3aMeishan 3aGerman Landrace 3apolymerase chain reaction 3avascular endothelial growth factor receptors 3aexpressed sequence tags 3aDuroc 3aLarge White 3asows 3aPietrain 3aembryogenesis 3alitter size 3amitogen-activated protein kinase 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism 2aAnimals 2aBreeding 2aFemale 2aFertilityxgenetics 2aLitter Sizexgenetics 2aPolymorphism, Restriction Fragment Length 2aPolymorphism, Single Nucleotide 2aSwinexgenetics 0aGermany 0agenes1 aHamann, H.1 aMuller, S.1 aDistl, O.0 tReproduction in domestic animals.g2010 Aug., v. 45, no. 4 p.579-584dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0936-67687nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1439-0531.2008.01304.x 7aarticle03185naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002300110245013300133300001400266500001500280520186000295650002102155650001602176650002002192650001002212650001702222650002502239650001602264650001802280650001302298650002102311650001902332650001602351650001002367650001202377650002102389653001802410653001602428653002602444653001802470653001102488700002102499700001702520773008802537852000902625930003302634945001302667946001102680655001202691IND2323135120221122051147.0010919s2001    ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232313512DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEstrada-Luna, A.A.10aPhysiological changes and growth of micropropagated chile ancho pepper plantlets during acclimatization and post-acclimatization  ap. 17-24.  a2019-12-05  aLittle is known about physiological changes that occur with micropropagated chile ancho pepper (Capsicum annuum L. cv. San Luis) plantlets during acclimatization. Plantlets were transferred to ex vitro conditions to study selected physiological changes and growth performance during acclimatization and post-acclimatization. The physiology of the plantlets was characterized by measuring leaf gas exchange and water status. Plant growth was determined by assessing plant height, leaf number, total leaf area, relative growth rate (RGR), and leaf, root, and stem dry matter (DM). Chile pepper plantlets became acclimatized within 6 days after transplantation. During this period, physiological adjustments occurred, which were critical for plantlet survival. After initial ex vitro transplanting, plantlets experienced water deficit [leaf wilting and reduced relative water content (RWC)], which corresponded with reduced stomatal conductance (gs) and transpiration (E), and an increase in stomatal resistance (rs). Thus, leaf stomata that developed in vitro were functional ex vitro. Because of this stomatal control, plantlets minimized transplant shock, recovered and survived. Prior to transplanting, plantlets were photomixotrophic, as indicated by low photosynthetic rates (A). During acclimatization, RWC, gs, E, and A were significantly lower two days after transplanting. However, within 6 days after transplanting, plantlets recovered and became photoautotrophic - attaining high A, gs, and E. Water use efficiency was initially low during the first days after transplanting, but increased dramatically at the end of the acclimatization period in part due to increased A.

The effects were also evaluated of using sterile filter paper to support explants and treatment with a high osmoticum medium (0.2 M mannitol/0.2 M sorbitol or 0.4 M maltose). In the optimised procedure, wheat microspore-derived embryos (MDEs), were placed on filter paper and incubated on medium containing 0.4 M maltose, for 4 h pre- and 45 h post-bombardment. Five microliters pAHC25 (0.75 mg ml(-1) in TE buffer) was precipitated onto 25 microliters gold particles (60 mg ml(-1) in sterile water), using 20 microliters spermidine (0.1 M) and 50 microliters CaCl2 (2.5 M). The particles were centrifuged and resuspended in 75 microliters absolute ethanol prior to the preparation of 6 macrocarriers. A microprojectile travel distance of 70 mm, a rupture pressure of 1300 p.s.i., and a vacuum of 29" Hg were employed. Maltose at 0.4 M in the support medium was the most important factor influencing GUS activity in bombarded tissues. GUS activity, 1 day post-bombardment, reached 52 +/- 17 GUS-positive foci/MDE (mean +/- s.e.m, n = 3), with 17 +/- 4 foci/MDE at 15 days, giving a 3.0-fold increase (p < 0.05) compared to expression in MDEs bombarded on medium without a high osmoticum treatment. 3agenetic transformation 3ain vitro culture 3abiolistics 3atransgenic plants 3agene expression 3aTriticum aestivum 3amicropropagation 3aculture media 0agene transfer 0amethodology1 aPower, J.B.1 aLowe, K.C.1 aDavey, M.R.0 tPlant cell, tissue, and organ culture.g1999, v. 57, no. 3 p.207-210x0167-68577nnas  aDNAL  a20000702b20000711c00000000  aINDdMKS  aNon-US 7aarticle02622naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001500110245006900125300001600194500001500210520155500225650001401780650001801794650002101812650001801833650001201851650001301863650001801876650002101894650002201915650001801937650002401955653001201979653001101991653001602002700001302018700001302031773009002044852000902134930003302143945001302176946001102189655001202200IND2204174920221122051203.0000429s1999    ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220417492DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhou, S.P.10aInduction and characterization of in vitro corms of diploid-taro  ap. 173-178.  a2019-12-05  aWhen in vitro plantlets were cultured in Murashige and Skoog liquid medium supplemented with 8-10% sucrose and 22-44 micromolar 6-benzylaminopurine, all of the stem explants formed corms. 170-850 micromolar paclobutrazol increased corm formation, whereas 1700 micromolar paclobutrazol inhibited corm development. Inclusion of 66 micromolar 6-benzylaminopurine in 170 micromolar paclobutrazol treatment resulted in smaller corms, and bigger corms formed in the combination of 1700 micromolar paclobutrazol and 66 micromolar 6-benzylaminopurine. No corms formed in 63-630 micromolar cycocel treatments. In vitro corm growth was also affected by the culture methods. Deep-layer agitated culture yielded corms of up to 2.03 g, with an average fresh weight of 0.7 g, 40 days after induction. In thin layer cultures, corms were up to 1.87 g, with an average fresh weight of 0.5 g. SDS-PAGE analysis of water-soluble proteins revealed changes of polypeptides with corm growth. Compared to smaller ones, corms over 0.2 g had higher dry matter, carbohydrate and anthocyanin content. These corms had a 99-100% survival rate upon transplanting directly to soil after storage at 4 degrees C for 10 months. This study indicates that the most economic production method of diploid taro seed corm is by thin-layer liquid culture in Murashige and Skoog medium supplemented with 22-44 micromolar benzylaminopurine and 8-10% sucrose for 6 weeks. The formed corms can be stored at 4 degrees C up to 10 months and transplanted directly into soil without acclimatization. 3acultivars 3apaclobutrazol 3ain vitro culture 3adose response 3asucrose 3aontogeny 3abenzyladenine 3amicropropagation 3agenetic variation 3aculture media 3aColocasia esculenta 0acycocel 0aploidy 0amethodology1 aHe, Y.K.1 aLi, S.J.0 tPlant cell, tissue, and organ culture.g1999, v. 57, no. 3 p.173-178x0167-68577nnas  aDNAL  a20000702b20000711c00000000  aINDdMKS  aNon-US 7aarticle02886naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001900110245016200129300001600291520170600307650001202013650001302025650001202038650001502050650001602065650001102081650001302092650001302105650001502118650000902133650001802142650002002160650002002180650001902200650001002219651001202229700001702241700001702258700001902275773008002294852000902374930003302383945001302416946001102429655001202440IND2199577220221122051100.0990701e199805  ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND219957722DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDiGnazio, F.J.10adelta15N of nitrate derived from explosive sources in a karst aquifer beneath the Ammunition Burning Ground, Crane Naval Surface Warfare Center, Indiana, USA  ap. 164-175.  aMilitary institutions involved in the production and demolition of explosives, propellants, and pyrotechnics have the potential to degrade groundwater aquifers through the addition of numerous contaminants including nitrate. A nitrate plume has been identified in a karst aquifer beneath the Ammunition Burning Ground (ABG) at the Crane Naval Surface Warfare Center, Indiana, USA. Wells located in the vicinity of surface impoundments and burn pans used for treatment of explosive materials show the highest concentrations of nitrate ranging from 11.2 to 19.6 mg l-1 as NO3-. Little is known about the isotopic composition of nitrates originating from these processes. Eight wells within the ABG were sampled and analyzed for nitrogen isotopic composition of nitrate. An enrichment in the delta15N (delta15N = +8.9, +12.0, +13.1, and +13.5 per thousand) occurred at four wells located near the primary areas of disposal activities within the ABG. Four wells located near the outer limits of the ABG had delta15N values significantly lower than those observed in the central area of the ABG (delta15N = +4.0, +4.1, +4.6, and +2.0 per thousand). Soil samples and burn-pan ash samples were collected and analyzed for the nitrogen isotopic composition of nitrate. Three soil nitrate samples had low delta15N values of -1.7, -1.8, and +2.2 per thousand. The burn-pan ash sample produced nitrate with a delta15N value of +2.99 per thousand. The observed enrichment in delta15N from samples taken from wells located near the ABG has been postulated to be a result of photodegradation or biochemical modification of RDX and TNT contaminated sludges and volatilization of NH3 in storage lagoons within the ABG. 3aammonia 3aaquifers 3aburning 3aexplosives 3agroundwater 3akarsts 3anitrates 3anitrogen 3aphotolysis 3asoil 3asoil sampling 3astable isotopes 3atrinitrotoluene 3avolatilization 3awells 3aIndiana1 aKrothe, N.C.1 aBaedke, S.J.1 aSpalding, R.E.0 tJournal of hydrology.g1998 May, v. 206, no. 3/4 p.164-175x0022-16947nnas  aDNAL  a19990901b19990909c00000000  aINDdRF1  aNon-US 7aarticle02311naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001300110245009400123300001600217500001500233520110800248650002101356650001901377650001601396650001301412650000901425650001501434650001401449650001101463650001001474650002101484650002201505650001801527650001101545653002201556653001101578653002501589653001601614700001601630700001601646700002301662773009001685852000901775930003301784945001301817946001101830655001201841IND2323162720221122051151.0010920s2001    ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232316272DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRoux, N.10aEffectiveness of three micropropagation techniques to dissociate cytochimeras in Musa spp  ap. 189-197.  a2019-12-05  aIn vitro mutagenesis of multicellular meristems of Musa spp. leads to a high degree of chimerism. Repeated vegetative propagation must be carried out to dissociate chimeras but the minimum number of cycles required is unknown. In general, mutated cells are difficult to monitor but mutations which result in a change in genome number are an exception. We simulated this case by colchicine treatment, followed by flow cytometric analysis. Colchicine treatment induced ploidy chimerism (mixoploidy), and chimera dissociation was assessed using three different propagation systems (shoot-tip culture technique--ST, multi-apexing culture technique--MA and corm slice culture technique--CS). The average percentage of cytochimeras was reduced from 100% to 36% after three subcultures using shoot-tip culture, from 100% to 24% when propagating by the corm slice culture technique and from 100% to 8% after the same number of subcultures using the multi-apexing technique. All propagation systems failed to eliminate chimerism completely. Factors that may influence chimera dissociation in vitro are discussed. 3aapical meristems 3atissue culture 3amutagenesis 3aexplants 3aMusa 3acolchicine 3achimerism 3aclones 3acorms 3amicropropagation 3agenetic variation 3aculture media 3ashoots 0ashoot tip culture 0aploidy 0aregenerative ability 0amethodology1 aDolezel, J.1 aSwennen, R.1 aZapata-Arias, F.J.0 tPlant cell, tissue, and organ culture.g2001, v. 66, no. 3 p.189-197x0167-68577nnas  aDNAL  a20010929b20011005c00000000  aINDdMKS  aNon-US 7aarticle03001naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001500110245010100125300001400226500010000240520182400340650001502164650001302179650001302192650001402205650001402219650001502233650001102248650001502259650000902274650001802283650001202301650002202313650001502335653001402350653002402364700001702388700001702405773007902422852000902501930003302510945001302543946001102556655001202567IND2200341520221122035956.0990827e199902  ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220034152DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchoen, R.10aModelling of solute transport in a large undistributed lysimeter, during steady-state water flux  ap. 82-93.  aIn the special issue: Preferential flow of water and solutes in soils / edited by C.J. Ritsema.  aTransport models have often been tested in laboratory studies using soil columns, usually of the order of 1 dm3 in size. Even if the columns are undisturbed, their small size does not allow water flow and solute transport to occur as they would in the field. We therefore used a 1.7 m3 column and applied steady-state flow rates of the order of 1 mm h(-1), and then applied pluses of tracers Br(-), Cl(-) and (2)H2O, and of atrazine (2-chloro-4-ethylamino-6-isopropylamino-S-triazine) to the surface. Classical models for tracers with these boundary conditions are the Convection-Dispersion model (CD), the two-region (mobile-immobile water) model with first-order exchange of solutes (MIM), and the transfer function models, among which the most widely used is the Convective Lognormal Transfer Function model (CLT). Thanks to simple boundary and initial conditions, analytical solutions are available for all these models. The CD model (1 parameter) was not able to fit the tracer elution curves, but use of the MIM model was satisfactory. The CLT model and the CD model (2 parameters) also gave satisfactory fits. To choose the best model we used the parameters fitted to the elution curves to predict vertical concentration profiles in the lysimeter. These predictions are compared to the profile obtained after thorough sampling of the soil when tracers reached about halfway down the lysimeter. The MIM model yielded a better prediction. However, accurate predictions would require taking into account the highly stratified characteristics of this soil. Atrazine simulation was done with the CD-based one-site kinetic sorption and first-order decay equation. Again analytical solutions are provided for our experimental conditions. Values of decay and absorption parameters are in agreement with previous studies. 3aabsorption 3aatrazine 3abromides 3achlorides 3aequations 3alysimeters 3amodels 3aprediction 3asoil 3asoil sampling 3asolutes 3atracer techniques 3awater flow 0alysimetry 0atransport processes1 aGaudet, J.P.1 aElrick, D.E.0 tJournal of hydrology.g1999 Feb., v. 215, no. 1/4 p.82-93x0022-16947nnas  aDNAL  a19991003b19991007c00000000  aINDdRF1  aNon-US 7aarticle03242naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245011100127300001500238500011500253500002400368520195200392650002202344650002402366650001902390650001602409650003002425650002902455650001502484650001302499650001302512650001702525651001102542651001202553651001302565651001602578700001702594773013802611852000902749856008602758655001202844IND4459255420221122035913.0110623s2011    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445925542DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMcGhee, G.C.10aErwinia amylovora CRISPR elements provide new tools for evaluating diversity and microbial source tracking  ap. 99-107.  aPaper presented at the Twelfth International Workshop on Fire Blight, held August 16-20, 2010, Warsaw, Poland.  aIncludes references  aCRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindrome repeats) arrays consist of direct repeating units interspersed with similarly-sized non repetitive spacers and are thought to mediate immunity against extra-chromosomal agents and limit horizontal gene transfer in prokaryotes through a proposed RNA-interference-like mechanism. Spacers are derived from sequences of preexisting transmissible genetic elements such as bacteriophages or conjugative plasmids and are presumably acquired during exposure to these elements. The number of CRISPR arrays in a bacterial chromosome is variable, and the content of each array can also differ in both repeat number and in the presence or absence of specific spacers. This variability provides a historical record or genetic footprint of a bacterial strain that is potentially reflective of a specific geographic region or host environment and may provide insight into the diversity of E. amylovora strains and assist in the genetic tracking of individuals. Forty-five strains varying in geographic location of isolation (from within Michigan and throughout the United States, Europe, and the Middle East), host range, plasmid content, and streptomycin sensitivity were evaluated for CRISPR array number and spacer variability. The CRISPR repeat sequence among E. amylovora strains consists of 29 bp and is universal despite host range, geographic distribution, or array number, and nearly identical to those found in E. pyrifoliae CRISPR 1 and 2 but not 3 and 4. A total of 357 unique spacers have been identified to date in CRISPR arrays present in E. amylovora. Spacer patterns from Michigan strains were mainly distinct from strains isolated in the western US, although strains from France and Lebanon included in the study shared the same patterns as some strains from Michigan.

On the nucleotide level, differentiation of individual E. amylovora strains from North America and from other countries was achieved with single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the genes gale and in acrB and hrpA. The discriminating PCR primers were specific at the 3’end and were applied at a high annealing temperature during the beginning of the PCR runs. Discrimination was possible in conventional PCR and in quantitative PCR. E. amylovora strains were further distinguished biochemically by synthesis of L-2,5-dihydrophenylalanine (DHP), an inhibitor of the shikimate pathway of bacteria, fungi and plants. DHP production was tested by thin layer chromatography and by growth inhibition of the yeast Rhodotorula glutinis. The compound was not produced by the E. amylovora strains isolated outside of North America. Approximately half of the American strains were positive for DHP. Raspberry strains share the characteristic SNP pattern of the fruit tree strains from North America, but may carry additional changes in gale. The gale gene of E. pyrifoliae differs for strains isolated in Korea and in Japan. We designed specific PCR primers from the gale gene to distinguish between strains from both countries. All E. pyrifoliae strains produced DHP. 3aDNA primers 3aErwinia amylovora 3aErwinia pyrifoliae 3aRhodotorula glutinis 3aannealing 3abacteria 3afruit trees 3agenes 3agrowth retardation 3apathogens 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3ashikimate pathway 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism 3atemperature 3athin layer chromatography 3ayeasts 3aJapan 3aKorean Peninsula 3aNorth America1 aGeider, K.1 aRausch, T.0 tActa horticulturae.g2011 May, , no. 896 p.95-98dInternational Society for Horticultural SciencewJournal:jnl46289x0567-75727nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.actahort.org/books/896/896_10.htm3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02832naa a2200289 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092024002200134024001900156040001800175100001500193245014800208300001400356520177200370653001902142653002402161653002902185653003702214773013402251852000902385856009202394930003302486946001102519655001202530IND4421670020221121235545.0090612e200909  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442167002DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-2249.2009.03951.x2doi7 aPMC27154362pmcid7 a196308662pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBallow, M.10aClinical experience with Flebogamma® 5% DIF: a new generation of intravenous immunoglobulins in patients with primary immunodeficiency disease  ap. 22-25.  aThe development of effective, safe, liquid intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIG) preparations has represented a major therapeutic advancement in the treatment of patients with antibody deficiencies. Flebogamma® 5% was the first liquid IVIG licensed in Europe that has been widely used in the treatment of immunodeficiency diseases. It has been proven to have an excellent efficacy and safety profile. Flebogamma® 5% dual inactivation and filtration (DIF) is a newly developed IVIG preparation that shares formulation characteristics and identical biochemical and stability profiles with Flebogamma® 5%. In addition to pasteurization, already performed in Flebogamma® 5%, solvent-detergent treatment and sequential nanofiltration through filters with pore sizes of 35 nm followed by 20 nm have been added to further enhance the pathogen safety margin. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and pharmacokinetics of Flebogamma® 5% DIF for immunoglobulin replacement therapy in patients with primary immunodeficiency diseases (PID). Flebogamma® 5% DIF was administered at seven clinical sites to 46 subjects with well-defined primary immunodeficiency diseases at a dose of 300-600 mg/kg every 21-28 days for 12 months. The serious bacterial infection rate was 0.021/subject/year. The incidence of adverse events considered potentially related to Flebogamma® 5% DIF during or within 72 h after completing an infusion was approximately 10%. The half-life in serum of the administered IgG was around 31 days. In summary, Flebogamma® 5% DIF is efficacious and safe, has good pharmacokinetic properties, is well-tolerated and maintains the profile of Flebogamma® 5% for the treatment of patients with primary humoral immune deficiency diseases. 0aclinical trial 0aFlebogamma® 5% DIF 0aintravenous immunoglobin 0aprimary immunodeficiency disease0 tClinical and experimental immunology.g2009 Sept., v. 157, no. s1 p.22-25dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0009-91047nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2249.2009.03951.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20090612b20090703c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03057naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024004200133040001800175100002700193245010800220300001400328520159000342650001401932650003701946650002301983650001402006650001102020650002802031650003702059650006702096650005602163650000902219650006702228653002402295653002002319653001702339773013402356852000902490856009202499930003302591946001102624655001202635IND4421669820221121235739.0090612e200909  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442166982DNAL7 a196308642pmid7 aPMC27154352pmcid7 a10.1111/j.1365-2249.2009.03952.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCunningham-Rundles, C.10aLung disease, antibodies and other unresolved issues in immune globulin therapy for antibody deficiency  ap. 12-16.  aDefects of antibody production are the most common of the primary immune defects of man. While these defects have been described in clinical terms for more than five decades, in most cases, the pathogenesis is still poorly understood. The most common clinically important of these is common variable immune deficiency. However there is no strict definition of this defect and the criteria for initiating immune globulin therapy are not standardized, leading to wide variation in treatment practices. In addition there has been no clear means to adequate assess progression of lung disease or elucidate the causes of progressive pulmonary inflammation found in some subjects. Moreover, there are still questions such as what are the best predictors of chronic lung disease and how can we prevent this disorder. Other complications such as autoimmunity, granulomatous disease, gastrointestinal inflation, are similarly poorly understood although treatment with various biological agents has been used with some success. A few bio-markers for assessing clinical and immunologic status have been proposed, and some have proved to be useful, but additional methods to gauge the benefits of therapy, predict outcomes, and harmonize treatment practices are needed. Aside from Ig replacement, additional means of prevention of lung disease may need consideration to reduce lung damage apart from prophylactic antibiotics. These might include using macrolides as anti-inflammatory agents, inhaled corticosteroids, bronchodilators, mucolytics or mechanical or rehabilitative respiratory methods. 3ainfection 2aB-Lymphocyte Subsetsximmunology 2aBiomarkersxblood. 2aHalf-Life 2aHumans 2aImmunoglobulin Gxblood 2aImmunoglobulinsxtherapeutic use 2aImmunologic Deficiency Syndromesxcomplicationsxdrug therapy. 2aLung Diseasesxcomplicationsxprevention & control. 2aMale 2aOpportunistic Infectionsxcomplicationsxprevention & control. 0aantibody deficiency 0aimmune globulin 0alung disease0 tClinical and experimental immunology.g2009 Sept., v. 157, no. s1 p.12-16dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0009-91047nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2249.2009.03952.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20090612b20090703c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03056naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092024002200134024001900156040001800175100001600193245019400209300001400403520178400417653003802201653003902239653002602278653002102304653003102325700001402356700001502370700001502385700001702400773013202417852000902549856009202558930003302650946001102683655001202694IND4421668620221121223915.0090612e200907  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442166862DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-2249.2009.03958.x2doi7 aPMC27105892pmcid7 a196597672pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOkamoto, T.10aHistamine H1-receptor antagonists with immunomodulating activities: potential use for modulating T helper type 1 (Th1)/Th2 cytokine imbalance and inflammatory responses in allergic diseases  ap. 27-34.  aBeing a first-line treatment for hypersensitivity allergic disease, histamine H1-receptor antagonists possess anti-inflammatory activity in addition to being H1-receptor antagonists. While it is not purely a histamine-related condition, hypersensitivity allergic disease is associated with an increase in the number of T helper type 2 (Th2) cells and Th2 cytokines, and a decrease in the number of Th1 cells and Th1 cytokines. Suppression of Th2-type cytokine production in addition to H1-receptor blockade may therefore represent a successful therapeutic strategy for the treatment of hypersensitivity allergic diseases. H1-receptor antagonists have been reported to modulate immune cascade at various points by acting on T cell-related inflammatory molecules, including adhesion molecules, chemokines and inflammatory cytokines. These effects of H1-receptor antagonists may be optimized for the treatment of allergic diseases. Besides their ability to regulate inflammatory molecules, some H1-receptor antagonists have been reported to down-regulate Th2 cytokine production. In particular, it has been shown that several H1-receptor antagonists specifically inhibit the production of Th2, but not Th1, cytokines. Accumulating evidence indicates a crucial role for Th1/Th2 cytokine imbalance on the development of allergic diseases. Accordingly, the use of H1-receptor antagonist with Th2 cytokine inhibitory activity to modulate Th1/Th2 cytokine imbalance might be a favourable strategy for the treatment of hypersensitivity allergic diseases. Furthermore, the identification of H1-receptor antagonists which possess immunoregulatory activities in addition to their anti-histamine activity will provide an important insight into the development of novel immunoregulatory drugs. 0ahistamine H1-receptor antagonists 0ahypersensitivity allergic reaction 0ainflammatory cytokine 0aT cell migration 0aTh1/Th2 cytokine imbalance1 aIwata, S.1 aOhnuma, K.1 aDang, N.H.1 aMorimoto, C.0 tClinical and experimental immunology.g2009 July, v. 157, no. 1 p.27-34dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0009-91047nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2249.2009.03958.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20090612b20090703c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03252naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001800110245006900128300001400197500017900211500002400390520181400414650002102228650003502249650002302284650003002307650001202337650001402349650001202363650001502375650002202390650001602412650001902428650001102447650001802458650002502476650001902501650001502520650001002535651001402545700001602559773013702575852000902712856008502721655001202806IND4459275820221121205424.0110624s2011    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445927582DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aArsanti, I.W.10aProfile of vegetable farming systems in upland area of Indonesia  ap. 29-35.  aPaper presented at the Third International Symposium on Improving the Performance of Supply Chains in the Transitional Economies, held July 4-8, 2010, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.  aIncludes references  aVegetable farming systems (VFSs) in Indonesia have a long tradition in the upland areas and were characterised by high productivity and competitiveness. However, in the last decade, the profitability of VFSs has been challenged by several issues including lower productivity, higher domestic prices, various export barriers, an increase in the volume of imported vegetables and environmental deterioration. This study was an attempt in part, to investigate the reasons for the decrease in the competitiveness of VFSs in upland areas of Java and Sumatra, in particular the social and gender circumstances. The present study was conducted in the three main upland vegetable producing centres in Pangalengan, Kejajar and Berastagi-Simpang Empat by distributing 150 questionnaires to farmers. Significant differences in social circumstances between Javanese (Pangalengan and Kejajar) and Sumatran farmers (BSE) were observed in the VFS practices in terms of the cultural and economic situation of households, farm size, education level, labour and wages, land ownership and investment, as well as the type of cultivation and cropping patterns. The VFSs in the three regions were also compared with regard to resource and labour inputs. Pangalengan could be categorized as a high-input system while BSE was a low-input system. Many farmers in Pangalengan rented land while this was less prevalent in the other two regions. Differences were also found with regard to the number of women in the work force, in particular for different cultivation activities. From the results of this study, it can be concluded that the VFSs in Pangalengan and Kejajar have improved their competitiveness through the more intensive use of inputs and high intensive farming practices. Social factors were observed to have less impact. 3acropping systems 3aeconomic outlook and situation 3aeducational status 3aenvironmental degradation 3aexports 3afarm size 3afarmers 3ahouseholds 3aintensive farming 3alabor force 3aland ownership 3aprices 3aprofitability 3apsychosocial factors 3aquestionnaires 3avegetables 3awomen 3aIndonesia1 aBohme, M.H.0 tActa horticulturae.g2011 May, , no. 895 p.29-35dInternational Society for Horticultural SciencewJournal:jnl46289x0567-75727nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.actahort.org/books/895/895_3.htm3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03285naa a2200601 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003400111040001800145100002300163245006900186300001600255500002400271520131400295650002101609650001901630650002101649650001601670650001801686650002201704650001301726650002601739650001601765650002201781650002401803650003901827650003401866650003701900650002201937650005401959650003802013650002902051650003602080650003102116650002802147650002902175650004202204650002102246650004802267650002302315700001902338700002702357700001902384700002202403700002502425700002002450773010802470852000902578856008402587655001202671IND4459274920221121205435.0110624s2011    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445927492DNAL7 a211718862pmid7 a10.1094/PHYTO-10-10-02742doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCandresse, Thierry10aAnalysis of the Epitope Structure of Plum pox virus Coat Protein  ap. 611-619.  aIncludes references  aTyping of the particular Plum pox virus (PPV) strain responsible in an outbreak has important practical implications and is frequently performed using strain-specific monoclonal antibodies (MAbs). Analysis in Western blots of the reactivity of 24 MAbs to a 112-amino-acid N-terminal fragment of the PPV coat protein (CP) expressed in Escherichia coli showed that 21 of the 24 MAbs recognized linear or denaturation-insensitive epitopes. A series of eight C-truncated CP fragments allowed the mapping of the epitopes recognized by the MAbs. In all, 14 of them reacted to the N-terminal hypervariable region, defining a minimum of six epitopes, while 7 reacted to the beginning of the core region, defining a minimum of three epitopes. Sequence comparisons allowed the more precise positioning of regions recognized by several MAbs, including those recognized by the 5B-IVIA universal MAb (amino acids 94 to 100) and by the 4DG5 and 4DG11 D serogroup-specific MAbs (amino acids 43 to 64). A similar approach coupled with infectious cDNA clone mutagenesis showed that a V74T mutation in the N-terminus of the CP abolished the binding of the M serogroup-specific AL MAb. Taken together, these results provide a detailed positioning of the epitopes recognized by the most widely used PPV detection and typing MAbs. 3aEscherichia coli 3aPlum pox virus 3aWestern blotting 3aamino acids 3acoat proteins 3acomplementary DNA 3aepitopes 3amonoclonal antibodies 3amutagenesis 3asequence analysis 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aAntibodies, Monoclonalximmunology 2aAntibodies, Viralximmunology 2aAntibody Specificityximmunology 2aBlotting, Western 2aCapsid Proteinsxchemistryxgeneticsximmunology. 2aEnzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay 2aEpitope Mappingxmethods 2aEpitopesxgeneticsximmunology. 2aEscherichia colixgenetics 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPlant Diseasesxvirology 2aPlum Pox Virusxgeneticsximmunology. 2aPrunusxvirology 2aRecombinant Proteinsxgeneticsximmunology. 2aSequence Alignment1 aSáenz, Pilar.1 aGarcía, Juan Antonio.1 aBoscia, Donato1 aNavrátil, Milan.1 aGorris, Teresa Maria1 aCambra, Mariano0 tPhytopathology.g2011 May, v. 101, no. 5 p.611-619dAmerican Phytopathological Societyx0031-949X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094/PHYTO-10-10-02743Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02027naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002000110245011700130300001600247500001500263520101000278650001801288650001101306650001201317650002101329650001901350650001401369650001101383650002301394653002201417653002201439653002201461653001701483773008701500852000901587930003301596945001301629946001101642655001201653IND2051847920221121045229.0960625s1995    gw |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205184792DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKatkowska, M.J.14aThe effect of external cesium ions on the muscle fibre resting potential in mealworm larva (Tenebrio molitor L.)  ap. 519-526.  a2019-12-05  aThe membrane potential of ventral longitudinal muscles of Tenebrio molitor larvae was studied as a function of time and of cesium substituted for all or part of external potassium. The conventional microelectrode technique was applied. The mean value of resting potential was -47.4 mV in standard physiological saline which did not change significantly with time (90 min). Cesium caused, almost immediately, a significant hyperpolarization of membrane potential the magnitude of which depended on cesium concentration. The presence of external potassium enhanced the effectiveness of cesium action, resulting in more pronounced hyperpolarization. The effect of Cs ions was fully reversible upon washing. These data support the idea that inward potassium current can be activated at resting potential level, at least in some cells, including the muscles studied. It is presumed that this potassium current might have some contribution to the resting membrane potential generation in mealworm larva muscles. 3amuscle fibers 3acesium 3acations 3aTenebrio molitor 3acell membranes 3apotassium 3alarvae 3amembrane potential 0ahyperpolarization 0apotassium channel 0aelectrophysiology 0apolarization0 tJournal of comparative physiology.g1995, v. 177, no. 4 p.519-526x0340-75947nnas  aDNAL  a19960801b19960808c00000000  aINDdNZM  aNon-US 7aarticle03363naa a2200625 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111024002200146040001800168100002900186245008200215300001800297500002400315506007600339520138700415506003701802650002501839650002601864650001301890650001001903650001401913650001101927650002501938650000901963650001701972650002601989650001302015650001102028650002602039650001702065650001302082650002402095650004802119650003502167650002702202650002802229650001402257650001902271650005302290650006202343650002302405650003402428700002602462700003002488700001702518700001602535700002102551773009602572852000902668856004802677655001202725IND4428467220221207131118.0091106e200911  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442846722DNAL7 a197985042pmid7 a10.1007/s00299-009-0775-22doi7 aPMC27664972pmcid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPanigrahi, Kishore C.

Here, we analyse the presence of classical auxin-binding protein (ABP1) homologues in the moss Funaria hygrometrica. Microsomal membranes isolated from protonemata of F. hygrometrica have specific indole acetic acid-binding sites, estimated to be about 3-5 pmol/mg protein with an apparent dissociation constant (K d) between 3 and 5 μM. Western analyses with anti-ABP1 antiserum detected the canonical endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-localised 22-24 kDa ABP1 in Zea mays, but not in F. hygrometrica. Instead, polypeptides of 31-33 and 46 kDa were labelled in the moss as well as in maize. In F. hygrometrica these proteins were found exclusively in microsomal membrane fractions and were confirmed as ABPs by photo-affinity labelling with 5-azido-[7-³H]-indole-3-acetic acid. Unlike the classical corn ABP1, these moss ABPs did not contain the KDEL ER retention sequence. Consistently, the fully sequenced genome of the moss Physcomitrella patens, a close relative of F. hygrometrica, encodes an ABP1-homologue without KDEL sequence. Our study suggests the presence of putative ABPs in F. hygrometrica that share immunological epitopes with ABP1 and bind auxin but are different from the classical corn ABP1.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aFunaria hygrometrica 3aPhyscomitrella patens 3aZea mays 3aacids 3aantiserum 3aauxins 3acell differentiation 3acorn 3adissociation 3aendoplasmic reticulum 3aepitopes 3agenome 3amosses and liverworts 3apolypeptides 3aproteins 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aBryopsidaxchemistryxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aIndoleacetic Acidsxmetabolism 2aMicrosomesxmetabolism 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPhylogeny 2aPlant Extracts 2aPlant Proteinsxchemistryxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aReceptors, Cell Surfacexchemistryxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aSequence Alignment 2aSequence Homology, Amino Acid1 aPanigrahy, Madhusmita1 aVervliet-Scheebaum, Marco1 aLang, Daniel1 aReski, Ralf1 aJohri, Man Mohan0 tPlant cell reports.g2009 Nov., v. 28, no. 11 p.1747-1758dSpringer-Verlagx0721-77147nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00299-009-0775-2 7aarticle01512naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001800110245006500128300001600193500011500209500002400324520029000348650001200638650002300650650003000673650001100703650002500714650001800739700001800757700001700775700001500792700001500807700001400822700001700836700001900853700002000872773013900892852000901031856008601040655001201126IND4459257720221120201054.0110623s2011    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445925772DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSmits, T.H.M.14aThe genome sequence of Pantoea vagans biocontrol strain C9-1  ap. 233-236.  aPaper presented at the Twelfth International Workshop on Fire Blight, held August 16-20, 2010, Warsaw, Poland.  aIncludes references  aThe genome of the biological control agent Pantoea vagans C9-1, a Gram-negative enterobacterial epiphyte found on a broad range of plants, was recently sequenced.

We investigated the possible role of these antioxidants in Pyrus communis ‘Conférence’ after infection with Erwinia amylovora. We analysed expression of the genes for SOD, APX and CAT and their diverse isoforms with Real Time qPCR. Infected and mock infected leaves, but also young and old leaves were included. In this study, we noticed a significant difference in transcription levels of some isoforms between mock and infected leaves en between young and old leaves.

A crucial constraint on signal transmission is imposed by background noise, which may include songs from other species. I investigated whether singing nightingales (Luscinia megarhynchos) avoid temporal overlap with the songs of other bird species in a playback experiment. I analysed the temporal song patterns of six males, each of which were exposed to songs of other species. The nightingales significantly avoided overlapping their songs with the playback songs, and started singing preferentially during the silent intervals between the heterospecific songs. This timing of song onset produced a greater variability in pause duration compared to the nightingales' undisturbed solo singing. These findings suggest that birds adjust their song timing to avoid acoustic interference on short temporal scales, and thus are able to improve the efficiency of acoustic communication in complex sonic environments. Moreover, the results indicate that temporal song patterns can be affected by the songs of other species, and thus such influences should be taken into account when studying bird song in the field. 3aLuscinia 3aacoustics 3aanimal communication 3abirds 3afemales 3ainterspecific competition 3amales 3aphysiology 3asexual selection0 tJournal of comparative physiology.g2006 Dec., v. 192, no. 12 p.1279-1285dBerlin/Heidelberg : Springer-Verlagx0340-75947nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00359-006-0158-x3electronic resource  a20061119b20061202c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02211naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002000145245007800165300001800243520120700261650001501468650001301483650001401496650000801510650001801518650000901536650001201545650001501557650001601572700001901588773013201607852000901739856006901748930003301817946001101850655001201861IND4384735020221120165309.0061025e200611  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438473502DNAL7 a10.1007/s00359-006-0149-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAutumn, Kellar 10aUltrahydrophobicity indicates a non-adhesive default state in gecko setae  ap. 1205-1212.  aGeckos may represent the world's most demanding adhesives application. The adhesive setae on the toes of climbing geckos must adhere strongly yet avoid fouling or attachment at inappropriate times. We tested the hypothesis that gecko setae are non-adhesive in their unloaded default state by comparing the water droplet contact angle (θ) of isolated setal arrays to the smooth surface of eye spectacle scales of tokay geckos (Gekko gecko). At equilibrium, θ was 98.3 ± 3.4° in spectacle scales of live geckos and 93.3 ± 3.5° in isolated spectacles. Isolated setal arrays were ultrahydrophobic, with θ of 160.6 ± 1.3° (means ± SD). The difference in θ of setal arrays and smooth spectacles indicates a very low contact fraction. Using Cassie's law of surface wettability, we infer that less than 6.6% of the surface of unloaded setae is solid and at least 93.4% is air space. We calculated that the contact fraction must increase from 6.6% in the unloaded state to 46% in the loaded state to account for previously measured values of adhesion. Thus gecko setae may be non-sticky by default because only a very small contact fraction is possible without mechanically deforming the setal array. 3aGekkonidae 3aadhesion 3aadhesives 3aair 3acontact angle 3aeyes 3afouling 3aphysiology 3awettability1 aHansen, Wendy 0 tJournal of comparative physiology.g2006 Nov., v. 192, no. 11 p.1205-1212dBerlin/Heidelberg : Springer-Verlagx0340-75947nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00359-006-0149-y3electronic resource  a20061026b20061102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02514naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001800110245016000128300001600288500001500304520130000319650001201619650002201631650000901653650001501662650001101677650002701688650002201715650001401737653002001751653002001771653001701791653001201808653001801820653001901838653002301857653001901880653002301899773009201922852000902014930003302023945001302056946001102069655001202080IND2332340520221120151737.0030501e200302  gw |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233234052DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPollack, G.S.10aSensory cues for sound localization in the cricket Teleogryllus oceanicus: interaural differences in response strength versus interaural latency difference  ap. 143-151.  a2019-12-05  aTwo potential sensory cues for sound location are interaural difference in response strength (firing rate and/or spike count) and in response latency of auditory receptor neurons. Previous experiments showed that these two cues are affected differently by intense prior stimulation; the difference in response strength declines and may even reverse in sign, but the difference in latency is unaffected. Here, I use an intense, constant tone to disrupt localization cues generated by a subsequent train of sound pulses. Recordings from the auditory nerve confirm that tone stimulation reduces, and sometimes reverses, the interaural difference in response strength to subsequent sound pulses, but that it enhances the interaural latency difference. If sound location is determined mainly from latency comparison, then behavioral responses to a pulse train following tone stimulation should be normal, but if the main cue for sound location is interaural difference in response strength, then post-tone behavioral responses should sometimes be misdirected. Initial phonotactic responses to the post-tone pulse train were frequently directed away from, rather than towards, the sound source, indicating that the dominant sensory cue for sound location is interaural difference in response strength. 3ahearing 3aperipheral nerves 3aears 3aphonotaxis 3asounds 3aTeleogryllus oceanicus 3aelectrophysiology 3areceptors 0asound direction 0aneurophysiology 0alocalization 0astimuli 0abinaural cues 0aauditory nerve 0aauditory receptors 0ainsect hearing 0ataxis (physiology)0 tJournal of comparative physiology.g2003 Feb., v. 189, no. 2 p.143-151x0340-75947nnas  aDNAL  a20030602b20030603c00000000  aINDdNZM  aNon-US 7aarticle02912naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001100129245011600140300001400256500001500270520133600285650001501621650002001636650002601656650001101682650001301693650001201706650002101718650000901739650003201748650000901780650003301789650002801822650002801850650002901878650003301907650001001940650002201950653002701972653002001999653001902019653001002038653001202048653001302060653001602073653002102089700001402110700001302124700001302137700001602150773009002166852000902256930003302265945001302298946001102311655001202322IND2332339920221120151718.0030501e200302  gw |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233233992DNAL7 a126070372pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYe, S.14aThe antennal system and cockroach evasive behavior. I. Roles for visual and mechanosensory cues in the response  ap. 89-96.  a2019-12-05  aCockroaches escape from predators by turning and then running. This behavior can be elicited when stimuli deflect one of the rostrally located and highly mobile antennae. We analyzed the behavior of cockroaches, under free-ranging conditions with videography or tethered in a motion tracking system, to determine (1) how antennal positional dynamics influence escape turning, and (2) if visual cues have any influence on antennal mediated escape. The spatial orientation of the long antennal flagellum at the time of tactile stimulation affected the direction of resultant escape turns. However, the sign of flagellar displacement caused by touch stimuli, whether it was deflected medially or laterally for example, did not affect the directionality of turns. Responsiveness to touch stimuli, and escape turn performance, were not altered by blocking vision. However, because cockroaches first orient an antenna toward stimuli entering the peripheral visual field, turn direction can be indirectly influenced by visual input. Finally, when vision was blocked, the run phase of escape responses displayed reduced average velocities and distances traveled. Our results suggest that tactile and visual influences are integrated with previously known wind-sensory mechanisms to achieve multisensory control of the full escape response. 3alocomotion 3ainsect behavior 3aPeriplaneta americana 3avision 3aantennae 2aAnimals 2aBehavior, Animal 2aCues 2aEscape Reactionxphysiology 2aMale 2aMechanoreceptorsxphysiology 2aOrientationxphysiology 2aPeriplanetaxphysiology 2aSense Organsxphysiology 2aSpatial Behaviorxphysiology 2aTouch 2aVisual Perception 0amechanical stimulation 0aanimal behavior 0avisual stimuli 0atouch 0aturning 0aposition 0aorientation 0aescape responses1 aLeung, V.1 aKhan, A.1 aBaba, Y.1 aComer, C.M.0 tJournal of comparative physiology.g2003 Feb., v. 189, no. 2 p.89-96x0340-75947nnas  aDNAL  a20030602b20030603c00000000  aINDdNZM  aNon-US 7aarticle02095naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001800110245010800128300001600236500001500252520110900267650001501376650001401391650002201405650001101427650001201438653001801450653001801468653001501486653001601501700001501517700001701532700001601549773009001565852000901655930003301664945001301697946001101710655001201721IND2207741420221120110746.0001113e200007  gw |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220774142DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPetrowitz, R.10aArrangement of optical axes and spatial resolution in the compound eye of the female blowfly Calliphora  ap. 737-746.  a2019-12-05  aWe determined the optical axes of ommatidia in the wild-type female blowfly Calliphora by inspecting the deep pseudopupil in large parts of the compound eye. The resulting map of optical axes allowed us to evaluate the spatial resolution in different parts of the eye in terms of interommatidial angles as well as the density of optical axes, and to estimate the orientation of ommatidial rows along the hexagonal eye lattice. The optical axes are not homogeneously distributed over the eye. In the frontal visual field the spatial resolution is about two times higher than in its lateral part and about three times higher as compared to the eye's dorsal pole region. The orientation of the ommatidial rows along the eye lattice is not the same for different regions of the eye but changes in a characteristic way. The inter-individual variability in the orientation of the ommatidial rows is estimated to be smaller than 8 degrees. The characteristic arrangement of the ommatidial lattice is discussed as an adaptation for efficient evaluation of optic flow as induced during self-motions of the animal. 3aCalliphora 3aommatidia 3aspatial variation 3avision 3afemales 0amotion vision 0acompound eyes 0aresolution 0apseudopupil1 aDahmen, H.1 aEgelhaaf, M.1 aKrapp, H.G.0 tJournal of comparative physiology.g2000 , v. 186, no. 7/8 p.737-746x0340-75947nnas  aDNAL  a20001204b20001212c00000000  aINDdNZM  aNon-US 7aarticle02217naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001400110245009400124300001600218500001500234520127800249650002001527650001201547650002101559650001301580650002601593650002201619653002701641653001501668653001301683700001801696773008701714852000901801930003301810945001301843946001101856655001201867IND2055196720221120100839.0970131s1996    gw |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205519672DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHamon, A.10aLocation and dynamic properties of the spike generator in an insect mechanosensory neuron  ap. 235-243.  a2019-12-05  aThe cereal bristle hairs of the cockroach, Periplaneta americana, are each innervated by one mechanosensory cell and 1-5 chemosensory cells. In transepithelial recordings, chemo- and mechanosensory spikes could be discriminated from each other by their relative amplitude. 2. When current steps were applied via the sensory hair, trains of impulses were triggered whatever the polarity of the current. 3. All responses adapted to the current, but the time course of adaptation was fitted by a power law for outward currents and an exponential law for inward currents. 4. During application of outward currents, the spikes showed a negative initial phase on which a small positive component was superimposed; strong polarizations produced purely negative spikes. More classical spikes with a positive initial phase were induced by inward currents. 5. The present work supports the hypothesis of a direct excitability of the apical dendrite in cereal bristle mechanoreceptors and confirms previous results suggesting that spikes are normally triggered within that region during mechanical stimulations. It is also established, for the first time, that adaptation to currents may be different in the apical dendrite and in more basal regions of the same mechanosensory neuron. 3aneurophysiology 3aneurons 3amechanoreceptors 3asensilla 3aPeriplaneta americana 3aelectrophysiology 0amechanical stimulation 0aadaptation 0adendrite1 aGuillet, J.C.0 tJournal of comparative physiology.g1996, v. 179, no. 2 p.235-243x0340-75947nnas  aDNAL  a19970303b19970307c00000000  aINDdNZM  aNon-US 7aarticle02523naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001300110245006700123300001600190500001500206520142700221650001201648650002201660650001201682650002701694650001401721650001101735650002201746650002301768650001401791653002001805653002601825653001201851653001901863653002001882653002001902653002601922773008701948852000902035930003302044945001302077946001102090655001202101IND2056000920221120100844.0970318s1996    gw |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205600092DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLang, F.10aNoise filtering in the auditory system of Locusta migratoria L  ap. 575-585.  a2019-12-05  aMany acoustically communicating grasshoppers live in crowded populations where sound of many individuals may cause permanent noise. Tympanic receptors and first-order auditory interneurons of Locusta migratoria code such noise tonically, whereas many higher order interneurons react only weakly. In response to simultaneously presented sound they exhibit a better signal-to-noise ratio than their presynaptic elements. Two possible filter mechanisms are suggested for noise reduction in higher-order interneurons: (i) high-pass filtering of receptor spike frequencies and (ii) filtering due to synchronization of receptor spikes. Different receptor spike frequencies were elicited by series of short noise pulses with variable repetition rates. Receptor activities differing in their degree of synchronization were elicited by sound stimuli with variable rising times. In contrast to the first order interneurons some higher order interneurons responded best to receptor spike frequencies above 150-200 Hz, thus showing the postulated filtering. Only one higher order interneuron (AN4) distinguished between synchronous and asynchronous receptor activities. It is suggested that high-pass filtering of receptor spike frequencies is responsible for the noise filtering observed in these interneurons. The synchronization selectivity of AN4 is proposed to be responsible for temporal pattern detection of conspecific sounds. 3ahearing 3aperipheral nerves 3aneurons 3aestrus synchronization 3afrequency 3asounds 3aelectrophysiology 3aLocusta migratoria 3areceptors 0aneurophysiology 0aauditory interneurons 0astimuli 0atympanic nerve 0anoise abatement 0aspike frequency 0aspike synchronization0 tJournal of comparative physiology.g1996, v. 179, no. 4 p.575-585x0340-75947nnas  aDNAL  a19970401b19970408c00000000  aINDdNZM  aNon-US 7aarticle02392naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002300110245009400133300001600227500001500243520127400258650002001532650001901552650000901571650001201580650001301592650001201605650001101617650002601628650002101654650002301675653003201698653001501730653002101745653001201766653002201778700001701800773008701817852000901904930003301913945001301946946001101959655001201970IND2054495020221120100935.0961216s1996    gw |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205449502DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWeisel-Eichler, A.10aNeuromodulation of flight initiation by octopamine in the cockroach Periplaneta americana  ap. 103-112.  a2019-12-05  aWe have tested the effect of a known insect neuromodulator, octopamine, on flight initiation in the cockroach. Using minimally dissected animals, we found that octopamine lowered the threshold for wind-evoked initiation of flight when applied to either of two major synaptic sites in the flight circuitry: 1) the last abdominal ganglion, where wind-sensitive neurons from the cerci excite dorsal giant interneurons, or 2) the metathoracic ganglion, where the dorsal giant interneurons activate interneurons and motoneurons which are involved in producing the rhythmic flight motor pattern in the flight muscles (Fig. 2). Correlated with this change in flight initiation threshold, we found that octopamine applied to the last abdominal ganglion increased the number of action potentials produced by individual dorsal giant interneurons when recruiting the cereal wind-sensitive neurons with wind puffs (Figs. 3, 4, 5) or with extracellular stimulation of their axons (Fig. 6). Octopamine increases the excitability of the giant interneurons (Figs. 7, 8). Also, when we stimulated individual dorsal giant interneurons intracellularly, the number of action potentials needed to initiate flight was reduced when octopamine was applied to the metathoracic ganglion (Fig 9). 3aneurophysiology 3aflight muscles 3awind 3aneurons 3aoctopine 3aganglia 3aflight 3aPeriplaneta americana 3aelectromyography 3amembrane potential 0aflight initiation threshold 0ainitiation 0aaction potential 0astimuli 0aelectrophysiology1 aLibersat, F.0 tJournal of comparative physiology.g1996, v. 179, no. 1 p.103-112x0340-75947nnas  aDNAL  a19970203b19970210c00000000  aINDdNZM  aNon-US 7aarticle02593naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245014500127300001600272520160100288650002001889650001301909650001001922650001001932650001901942650002201961650001201983650001901995653002602014653002102040653002902061773008702090852000902177930003302186945001302219946001102232655001202243IND2054495120221120100929.0961216s1996    gw |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205449512DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZiesmann, J.14aThe physiology of an olfactory sensillum of the termite Schedorhinotermes lamanianus: carbon dioxide as a modulator of olfactory sensitivity  ap. 123-133.  aThere are three morphological types of wall-pore single-walled sensilla on the antennae of Schedorhinotermes lamanianus workers. Among these, the sensilla of the type SW1 always bear two neurons that are distinguishable by their impulse amplitudes in electrophysiological recordings. Both neurons are odour-sensitive and respond with excitation to an equally narrow and strikingly congruent spectrum of odours. 1-Pentanol, 1-hexanol and 2-hexanol cause maximum excitation in both cells. In addition one cell responds to CO2. Short pulses of CO2 up to 3 s duration inhibit this cell totally. The duration of total inhibition increases with the logarithm of the CO2-concentration between 0.06% and 100%. Pulses of CO2 with concentrations above 0.15% cause an inhibition that lasts longer than the period of stimulation. Prolonged CO2-stimuli (> 300s) with a concentration between 0.5% and 5% CO2 initially cause total inhibition. However, after 1 to 5 min, activity reappears and reaches a new constant but dose-dependent frequency. None of the stimulatory odours leads to a response in the cell when applied together with CO2. The sensitivity to odours of this one cell type is "switched off" by CO2, whilst CO2 does not influence the other neuron in the same sensillum. The CO2-concentration, (high in the centres of termite nests low outside the nests) may give important information about the context in which an individual receives a signal. The described modulation of odour-sensitivity by CO2 allows the presentation of two hypothetical mechanisms of context-dependent signal interpretation. 3aRhinotermitidae 3asensilla 3asmell 3aodors 3acarbon dioxide 3aelectrophysiology 3aneurons 3achemoreceptors 0aolfactory stimulation 0aodor sensitivity 0acarbon dioxide receptors0 tJournal of comparative physiology.g1996, v. 179, no. 1 p.123-133x0340-75947nnas  aDNAL  a19970203b19970210c00000000  aINDdNZM  aNon-US 7aarticle02377naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001900110245010700129300001400236500001500250520132400265650001801589650001301607650000901620650002201629650002001651650002201671653002001693653002201713653001201735653002801747653002201775653002601797700001701823773008501840852000901925930003301934945001301967946001101980655001201991IND2054494920221120084419.0961216s1996    gw |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205449492DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDriesang, R.B.10aPhysiological changes in central neuronal pathways contributing to the generation of a reflex reversal  ap. 45-57.  a2019-12-05  a1. In the stick insect Carausius morosus the properties of the neuronal network governing the femur-tibia joint depend on the behavioral state of the animal. In the inactive animal flexion of the femur-tibia joint results in the generation of a resistance reflex, while in the active animal the same stimulus induces the so-called active reaction, the first part of which is a reflex reversal. 2. Recordings from motoneurons innervating the extensor tibiae muscle indicated that their time course of activity during the active reaction is due to inputs from intercalated pathways. We therefore investigated the role of identified nonspiking interneurons that transmit sensory information from the chordotonal organ onto the extensor motoneurons in the inactive animal. We can show that (i) the nonspiking interneurons received altered inputs whereas (ii) they provided qualitatively the same synaptic drive onto leg motoneurons. 3. From our results it is clear that (i) neuronal pathways contributing to the generation of the resistance reflex are also involved in the generation of the reflex reversal in the same control loop, (ii) thereby adopting the same principle of information processing (parliamentary principle), because both, supporting and opposing pathways contribute to the generation of the motor output. 3amotor neurons 3areflexes 3alegs 3aelectrophysiology 3ajoints (animal) 3aCarausius morosus 0aneurophysiology 0afemur-tibia joint 0aneurons 0anonspiking interneurons 0aresistance reflex 0asensory-motor pathway1 aBuschges, A.0 tJournal of comparative physiology.g1996, v. 179, no. 1 p.45-57x0340-75947nnas  aDNAL  a19970203b19970210c00000000  aINDdNZM  aNon-US 7aarticle01592naa a2200253 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002100145245011400166300001400280500002400294520075500318650002001073650002101093650001801114700002001132773011701152852000901269856004801278655001201326IND4440998920221120084516.0100806e201006  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444099892DNAL7 a10.3103/S014768741002002X2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPrikhodko, V.

It is shown that irrigated soils of weakly drained landscapes compared with drained change more rapidly as a result of humidization, leading to acceleration and intensification of the mutual influence of processes at all levels of their organization. Positive and negative phenomena are noted under irrigation, the rate and extent of which depend on soil type, degree of drainage of the landscape, changes in the water regime and moisture content of the soils, quality of the irrigation water, and level of agrotechnologies. 3airrigated soils 3airrigation water 3awater content1 aManakhov, D.

They were subsequently tested with different subtended visual angles of that spot, generated by different disk diameters and different distances from the decision point in the device. Bees were trained easily to detect bee-chromatic colours, but not an achromatic one. Chromatic contrast was not the only parameter allowing learning and, therefore, detection: alpha min, the subtended visual angle at which the bees detect a given stimulus with a probability P0 = 0.6, was 5 degrees for stimuli presenting both chromatic contrast and contrast for the green photoreceptors [i.e. excitation difference in the green photoreceptors, between target and background (green contrast)], and 15 degrees for stimuli presenting chromatic but no green contrast. Our results suggest that green contrast can be utilized for target detection if target recognition has been established by means of the colour vision system. The green-contrast signal would be used as a far-distance signal for flower detection. This signal would always be detected before chromatic contrast during an approach flight and would be learned in compound with chromatic contrast, in a facilitation-like process. 3aApis mellifera 3avision 3acolor 3adetection 3aphotoreceptors 3alearning 0avisual stimuli 0acolor vision 0achromatic contrast1 aVorobyev, M.1 aKevan, P.1 aMenzel, R.0 tJournal of comparative physiology.g1996, v. 178, no. 5 p.699-709x0340-75947nnas  aDNAL  a19961202b19961205c00000000  aINDdNZM  aNon-US 7aarticle02771naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001700128245013100145300001600276520128900292650001201581650001401593650001401607650002301621650001101644650001401655650001801669650001201687650002301699650001101722650002601733650000901759650001401768650001201782650002401794650001601818650003601834653002201870653001601892653001501908653001501923653001001938653002301948653001901971700002301990700002502013700002602038773008702064852000902151930003302160945001302193946001102206655001202217IND2053356520221120084419.0961003s1996    gw |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205335652DNAL7 a85834222pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCerbon, M.A.14aThe rabbit submandibular gland: sexual dimorphism, effects of gonadectomy, and variations across the female reproductive cycle  ap. 351-357.  aSex differences and the effect of various endocrine conditions on the histology of the rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus L.) submandibular (chin) gland were investigated. The female gland contained significantly more acini/field than the male gland. The diameter of acini was significantly smaller than those of the male gland. Gonadectomy reduced the number of acini/field and increased their diameter in females but provoked the opposite effect in males. Gonadectomy drastically reduced the percent of acini with crystal bodies in both sexes, and the percent of acini with apocrine secretion only in females. Estrous does showed a significantly higher number of acini/field than pregnant (days 20 and 29) and lactating (day 6) does. Acini containing crystal bodies declined from 22% in estrous females to 8% and 3% in pre-parturient (gestation day 31) and lactating (day 6) does, respectively. By contrast, acini showing apocrine secretion increased from 12% in estrous females to 43% in pre-parturient does and declined to 23% on lactation day 6. In all glands glycoproteins were noted in crystal bodies but not in apocrine secretion. Results show a sexual dimorphism in the rabbit chin gland histology and support the participation of gonadal steroids in its physiological regulation. 3arabbits 3ahistology 3asecretion 3agender differences 3aestrus 3apregnancy 3aanimal glands 2aAnimals 2aEstrusxphysiology 2aFemale 2aLactationxphysiology 2aMale 2aPregnancy 2aRabbits 2aSex Characteristics 2aSex Factors 2aSubmandibular Glandxphysiology 0alactating females 0agonadectomy 0asecretions 0achin gland 0aacini 0aapocrine secretion 0acrystal bodies1 aCamacho-Arroyo, I.1 aGamboa-Dominguez, A.1 aGonzalez-Mariscal, G.0 tJournal of comparative physiology.g1996, v. 178, no. 3 p.351-357x0340-75947nnas  aDNAL  a19961101b19961107c00000000  aINDdNZM  aNon-US 7aarticle02879naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001800128245011400146300001600260500001500276520134500291650002401636650001501660650002301675650001801698650001401716650001801730650001001748650001701758650000901775650001201784650002201796650002001818650001201838650001701850650003701867650001101904650002901915650000901944650003001953650001301983650002401996650002802020650004202048653001202090653002302102653001402125700002102139773008702160852000902247930003302256945001302289946001102302655001202313IND2053674320221120084524.0961022s1996    gw |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205367432DNAL7 a86182172pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aReinitz, C.A.10aBehavioral and cellular effects of serotonin on locomotion and male mating posture in Ascaris suum (Nematoda)  ap. 655-667.  a2019-12-05  aThe site and mode of action of serotonin on locomotion were investigated in the parasitic nematode Ascaris suum. Injection of serotonin into Ascaris immediately caused paralysis in animals that were generating locomotory waveforms. Injected serotonin also increased body length and decreased the number of propagating body waves. Similar injections into the male tail produced a ventral tail curl. Injection of N-acetyl-serotonin had no effect on the generation of locomotory waveforms, but increased the body length and decreased the number of body waves in the waveform. Other biogenic amines were also tested but were much less potent. Serotonin decreased the amplitude of a submaximal acetylcholine-induced muscle contraction and increased the time to attain this contraction. The time course of this effect on the response to ACh was much slower than the action of injected serotonin on locomotory waveforms, suggesting that additional elements are involved in the action of serotonin on locomotory behavior. Serotonin abolished spontaneous slow potentials in VI motor neurons and decreased the frequency of EPSPs in DE2 motor neurons, probably by a pre-synaptic mechanism. In the male tail, serotonin depolarized the male-specific transverse ventral muscle cells, but did not affect either dorsal or ventral longitudinal muscle cells. 3amechanism of action 3alocomotion 3amuscle contraction 3amuscle fibers 3aserotonin 3amotor neurons 3amales 3aAscaris suum 3atail 3aposture 3aelectrophysiology 3amating behavior 2aAnimals 2aAscaris suum 2aDose-Response Relationship, Drug 2aFemale 2aLocomotionxdrug effects 2aMale 2aMotor Neuronsxphysiology 2aNematoda 2aPosturexphysiology 2aSerotoninxpharmacology 2aSexual Behavior, Animalxdrug effects 0aneurons 0acopulatory posture 0atail curl1 aStretton, A.O.W.0 tJournal of comparative physiology.g1996, v. 178, no. 5 p.655-667x0340-75947nnas  aDNAL  a19961202b19961205c00000000  aINDdNZM  aNon-US 7aarticle02465naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001900110245007200129300001600201500001500217520130400232650002301536650001501559650001801574650002001592650001501612650001601627650002201643650002301665650001901688653001501707653002001722653001701742653001401759653001901773653001901792653002401811700001501835700001601850773008701866852000901953930003301962945001301995946001102008655001202019IND2052613620221120073634.0960815s1995    gw |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205261362DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFacciponte, G.14aThe innervation of a ventral abdominal protractor muscle in Locusta  ap. 645-657.  a2019-12-05  aThe innervation of the external ventral protractor muscle of the VIIth abdominal segment (M234) of Locusta migratoria is described using a combination of neurophysiological and neuroanatomical techniques. Cobalt backfills of the nerve innervating M234 revealed two neurons each with some and fields of arborization in the VIIth abdominal ganglion. In addition, extracellular stimulation of the nerve while gradually increasing the stimulus amplitude resulted in a stepwise increase in both the excitatory junction potential amplitude and twitch amplitude so that two different amplitudes of each were observed indicating the sequential recruitment of two motor neurons. 4-Di-2-ASP stains of M234 revealed pre-synaptic boutons at M234 and a neurohaemal plexus covering the nerve the latter being corroborated by electron microscopic examination of nerve sections. Electron microscopic examination of M234 revealed two axon terminal types, one which is similar to the neurohaemal varicosities over the nerve, containing granules of high electron-density, and one which contains larger granules of medium electron-density. Both terminals types also contained small electron lucent vesicles. Finally, twitch contractions of M234 were modulated by glutamate, proctolin, octopamine, and SchistoF-LRFamide. 3amuscle contraction 3aoctopamine 3aneuropeptides 3askeletal muscle 3aglutamates 3ainnervation 3aelectrophysiology 3aLocusta migratoria 3aultrastructure 0amodulation 0aneurophysiology 0aneuroanatomy 0aproctolin 0aneurochemistry 0aanimal anatomy 0aschistoflrf peptide1 aMiksys, S.1 aLange, A.B.0 tJournal of comparative physiology.g1995, v. 177, no. 5 p.645-657x0340-75947nnas  aDNAL  a19960903b19960911c00000000  aINDdNZM  aNon-US 7aarticle01924naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001900110245011800129300001400247500001500261520062800276650002200904650001800926650002100944650001600965650002500981650001401006650001501020651001101035653001601046653001501062653001701077653002001094653002001114653001901134653001501153653001301168700001601181700001901197700001501216700001901231700001301250700001601263773008501279852000901364930003301373945001301406946001101419655001201430IND2052689420221120073529.0960820s1996    gw |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205268942DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHolldobler, B.10aCommunication in the migratory termite-hunting ant Pachycondyla (= Termitopone) marginata (Formicidae, Ponerinae)  ap. 47-53.  a2019-12-05  aThe Neotropical species Pachycondyla marginata conducts well-organized predatory raids on the termite species Neocapritermes opacus and frequently emigrates to new nest sites.

Among the substances identified in the pygidial gland secretions only citronellal was effective as a trail pheromone. Isopulegol elicited an increase in locomotory activity in the ants and may function as a synergist recruitment signal.

The abundant centre model predicts that species abundance will decline from the centre towards the periphery of the geographic range. Thus, we expect to find decreases from the centre towards the edge in variables related to population dynamics such as population density and reproductive output. However, evidence for this pattern is contradictory, suggesting that geographically peripheral sites may not be ecologically peripheral. Populations may thrive in pockets of suitable habitat at the edge of the range or may be locally adapted to peripheral conditions. 2. This study examines how the position of a site within geographic and climatic ranges of 13 species is related to the population dynamics at one common location, The Desert Laboratory at Tumamoc Hill, Tucson, AZ, USA. 3. We used data on survival, fecundity, germination fraction and population density from a 25-year long-term data set on winter annual plants to determine whether there was a relationship between distance to the centre of the range and population dynamics. Geographic distance was calculated by determining the distance from the Desert Laboratory to the centre of the observed range determined from locality records. Climatic distance was calculated using the niche modelling software, maxent, and subtracting the mean climatic profile for the species range from that of the Desert Laboratory. 4. There was no relationship between mean population metrics and distance metrics. We found significant relationships between some geographic distance metrics and variance in fecundity, survival and per-germinant fecundity, but not germination fraction or population density. We did not find a relationship with any metric of population dynamic variation and climatic distance. 5. Synthesis. Our results indicate that geographic distance from the centre of the range of 13 annual plant species more strongly predicts their population dynamics than climatic distance. This study reinforces the importance of examining vital rates and their variation in order to properly capture the effect of position within a range on population dynamics. 3aannuals 3acomputer software 3adata collection 3aedge effects 3afecundity 3agermination 3amodels 3apopulation density 3apopulation dynamics 3areproductive performance 3avariance 3aUnited States1 aAngert, Amy L.1 aVenable, D.

This account presents information on all aspects of the biology of Stachys palustris (Marsh Woundwort) that are relevant to understanding its ecological characteristics and behaviour. The main topics are presented within the standard framework of the Biological Flora of the British Isles: distribution, habitat, communities, responses to biotic factors, responses to environment, structure and physiology, phenology, floral and seed characters, herbivores and disease, history, and conservation. 2. Stachys palustris is a monoecious perennial herb, with long creeping, strong, subsurface rhizomes. It is a common native herb growing by streams, rivers, ditches, ponds, in fens, marshes and swamps, and less frequently a weed of cultivated land. 3. Although widespread throughout most of the British Isles, S. palustris is typically a plant of land-water transitional situations that are not seral and, as such, appears to be under-represented in descriptions of plant communities. 4. Stachys palustris is typically found on intermittently flooded and poorly drained soils, which are weakly acid or weakly basic and highly fertile. 5. The production of numerous subsurface rhizomes by S. palustris helps to maintain shoot population density with little recourse to seedling recruitment. 6. Stachys × ambigua, the hybrid between Stachys palustris and S. sylvatica, is most frequent in northern and western Britain. 7. Stachys palustris is particularly valuable as a nectar source for insects, especially bumblebees. It has antispasmodic, antiseptic and astringent properties; the name ‘Woundwort' derives from its traditional use in staunching bleeding and healing wounds. 3aStachys 3anectar 3aseedlings 3apoorly drained soils 3ainsects 3ashoots 3amarshes 3ahybrids 3aponds 3aphenology 3aflora 3apopulation density 3afens 3aherbivores 3aweeds 3aswamps 3arivers 3aplant communities 3aBombus 3astreams 3aindigenous species 3arhizomes 3ahabitats 3aUnited Kingdom 0arecruitment1 aRowland, Phillip0 tjournal of ecology.g2011 July, v. 99, no. 4 p.1081-1090dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0022-04777nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2745.2011.01849.x 7aarticle02861naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092024002200127024001900149040001800168100002200186245012500208300001600333506007600349520136100425506003701786650002301823650002001846650001301866650001501879650001301894650001701907650001901924650002201943650001401965650001601979650001801995650001202013650002402025650001002049650001402059700001302073700002502086773012902111852000902240856008602249930003302335946001102368655001202379IND4391941720221207123656.0070529e200706  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439194172DNAL7 a10.1007/s00359-007-0218-x2doi7 aPMC19155832pmcid7 a173727412pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRoessingh, Peter 10aOlfactory receptors on the maxillary palps of small ermine moth larvae: evolutionary history of benzaldehyde sensitivity  ap. 635-647.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aIn lepidopterous larvae the maxillary palps contain a large portion of the sensory equipment of the insect. Yet, knowledge about the sensitivity of these cells is limited. In this paper a morphological, behavioral, and electrophysiological investigation of the maxillary palps of Yponomeuta cagnagellus (Lepidoptera: Yponomeutidae) is presented. In addition to thermoreceptors, CO₂ receptors, and gustatory receptors, evidence is reported for the existence of two groups of receptor cells sensitive to plant volatiles. Cells that are mainly sensitive to (E)-2-hexenal and hexanal or to (Z)-3-hexen-1-ol and 1-hexanol were found. Interestingly, a high sensitivity for benzaldehyde was also found. This compound is not known to be present in Euonymus europaeus, the host plant of the monophagous Yponomeuta cagnagellus, but it is a prominent compound in Rosaceae, the presumed hosts of the ancestors of Y. cagnagellus. To elucidate the evolutionary history of this sensitivity, and its possible role in host shifts, feeding responses of three Yponomeuta species to benzaldehyde were investigated. The results confirm the hypothesis that the sensitivity to benzaldehyde evolved during the ancestral shift from Celastraceae to Rosaceae and can be considered an evolutionary relict, retained in the recently backshifted Celastraceae-specialist Y. cagnagellus.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aEuonymus europaeus 3aMustela erminea 3aRosaceae 3aYponomeuta 3aancestry 3abenzaldehyde 3acarbon dioxide 3aelectrophysiology 3aequipment 3ahost plants 3ainsect larvae 3ainsects 3aolfactory receptors 3apalps 3areceptors1 aXu, Sen 1 aMenken, Steph B.

The ON1 neuron provides contralateral inhibitory input to AN2, thereby enhancing bilateral contrast between the left and right AN2s, an important cue for sound localization. We examine how the structures of the spike trains of these neurons affect this inhibitory interaction. As previously shown for AN2, ON1 responds to salient peaks in stimulus amplitude with bursts of spikes. Spike bursts, but not isolated spikes, reliably signal the occurrence of specific features of the stimulus. ON1 and AN2 burst at similar times relative to the amplitude envelope of the stimulus, and bursts are more tightly time-locked to stimulus feature than the isolated spikes. As a consequence, spikes that, in the absence of contralateral inhibition, would occur within AN2 bursts are more likely to be preceded by spikes in ON1 (mainly also in bursts) than are isolated AN2 spikes. This leads to a large decrease in the burst rate of the inhibited AN2. We conclude that the match in coding properties of ON1 and AN2 allows contralateral inhibition to be most efficient for those portions of the response that carry the behaviourally relevant information, i.e. for bursts. 3aOrthoptera 3abrain 3aneurons 3aphysiology 3aultrasonics1 aPollack, G.

The diffusion barrier approach loads a tiny protein sample volume into a much larger volume of dispersant, which contains the electrodes; the LDE measurement is then recorded before the sample can diffuse to the electrodes. We demonstrate that sample volumes are reduced by up to two orders of magnitude to volumes typically associated with separation techniques (∼50 μL), no reduction in measurement sensitivity occurs, samples can be retrieved usefully intact, post-measurement and typical measurement times are of the order of minutes. Measurements of BSA mobility up to 75°C and 1 M buffer concentration and lysozyme at a concentration as low as 0.5 mg/mL are demonstrated using the technique with good agreement with literature values. 3aelectrodes 3aelectrophoresis 3alysozyme1 aConnah, Malcolm T.1 aMattison, Kevin0 tElectrophoresis.g2011 July, v. 32, no. 14 p.1787-1794dWiley-VCH Verlagx0173-08357nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/elps.2011001083Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b00000000c20110722  aNon-US 7aarticle02325naa a2200301 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002300145245011400168300001600282520134900298650001301647650001301660650001701673650001501690650002001705650001101725700002401736773012901760852000901889856006901898930003301967946001102000655001202011IND4388209120221120024459.0070225e200703  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438820912DNAL7 a10.1007/s00359-006-0191-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGlantz, Raymon M. 10aOrientation by polarized light in the crayfish dorsal light reflex: behavioral and neurophysiological studies  ap. 371-384.  aIn decapod crustaceans, the dorsal light reflex rotates the eyestalk so that the dorsal retina faces the brightest segment of dorsal visual space. Stepwise displacements of white stripes elicit eyestalk rotations in the same direction as that of the stripe. Conversely, stepwise displacements of black stripes on a white background elicit eyestalk rotations in the opposite direction as that of the stripe. The reversal of the response with contrast inversion distinguishes the dorsal light reflex from an optokinetic reflex. When the visual scene is composed of polarized light, segmented by variations in e-vector orientation, displacement of segments containing near vertical e-vectors elicit responses similar to those elicited by a white stripe. Displacement of polarized stripes containing near horizontal e-vectors elicit eyestalk rotations similar to those elicited by a black stripe. The results are consistent with the use of polarized light in orientation. The stimulus conditions described above were also applied to visual interneurons (sustaining fibers) and oculomotor neurons and the results were generally in accord with the behavior. In the neural studies, it was possible to show that responses to polarized stripe displacements are predictable from the receptive field location and the neuron's polarization tuning function. 3aDecapoda 3acrayfish 3ainterneurons 3aphysiology 3apolarized light 3aretina1 aSchroeter, John P. 0 tJournal of comparative physiology.g2007 Mar., v. 193, no. 3 p.371-384dBerlin/Heidelberg : Springer-Verlagx0340-75947nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00359-006-0191-93electronic resource  a20070225b20070303c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle01438naa a2200301 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100002100115245009200136300001500228300002000243520057800263650001100841650002400852650001900876650002400895653001500919653001500934653002000949773009200969852000901061939003301070945000801103946001301111655001201124991610228530742620221120024513.0810618e198006  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI810013092DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNorback, John P.10aRouting school food service vehicles: Formal analysis for assistance in decision making  ap. 96-100.  ap. 96-100. ill.  aFormal analysis of school food service scheduling problems, with the aid of a computer and the modeling process, was undertaken for a central kitchen-satellite school situation in response to high energy costs.

The ability to synthesize and degrade prunasin and amygdalin in the almond kernel was studied throughout the growth season using four different genotypes for bitterness. Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry analyses showed a specific developmentally dependent accumulation of prunasin in the tegument of the bitter genotype. The prunasin level decreased concomitant with the initiation of amygdalin accumulation in the cotyledons of the bitter genotype. By administration of radiolabeled phenylalanine, the tegument was identified as a specific site of synthesis of prunasin in all four genotypes. A major difference between sweet and bitter genotypes was observed upon staining of thin sections of teguments and cotyledons for β-glucosidase activity using Fast Blue BB salt. In the sweet genotype, the inner epidermis in the tegument facing the nucellus was rich in cytoplasmic and vacuolar localized β-glucosidase activity, whereas in the bitter cultivar, the β-glucosidase activity in this cell layer was low. These combined data show that in the bitter genotype, prunasin synthesized in the tegument is transported into the cotyledon via the transfer cells and converted into amygdalin in the developing almond seed, whereas in the sweet genotype, amygdalin formation is prevented because the prunasin is degraded upon passage of the β-glucosidase-rich cell layer in the inner epidermis of the tegument. The prunasin turnover may offer a buffer supply of ammonia, aspartic acid, and asparagine enabling the plants to balance the supply of nitrogen to the developing cotyledons.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aasparagine 3aammonia 3acultivars 3abitterness 3anitrogen balance 3aaspartic acid 3asalts 3aamygdalin 3acotyledons 3agenotype 3aphenylalanine 3aalmonds 3amass spectrometry 3aPrunus dulcis 2aAmygdalinxbiosynthesis 2aCarbon Radioisotopes 2aCellulasesxmetabolism 2aFlowersxphysiology 2aFruitxenzymologyxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aGlucosyltransferasesxmetabolism 2aMicrosomesxmetabolism 2aNitrilesxmetabolism 2aPhenylalaninexmetabolism 2aPlant Exudatesxmetabolism 2aPrunusxenzymologyxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aTyrosinexmetabolism 0aseeds1 aJørgensen, Kirsten1 aOlsen, Carl Erik1 aDicenta, F.q(Federico)1 aMøller, Birger Lindberg0 tPlant physiology.g2008 Mar., v. 146, no. 3 p.1040-1052dAmerican Society of Plant Biologistsx0032-08897nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1104/pp.107.1129793Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02036naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002500145245009600170300001600266520073000282650001501012650001501027650002201042650001701064650001101081650001201092650001301104650001301117650002401130650001201154650002001166650002201186700002601208700002201234700002101256700002201277700001801299700002201317773012901339852000901468856006901477930003301546946001101579655001201590IND4387229120221120024346.0070128e200702  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438722912DNAL7 a10.1007/s00359-006-0200-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMotosaka, Katsunori 10aCyclic AMP-dependent memory mutants are defective in the food choice behavior of Drosophila  ap. 279-283.  aAcute choice behavior in ingesting two different concentrations of sucrose in Drosophila is presumed to include learning and memory. Effects on this behavior were examined for four mutations that block associative learning (dunce, rutabaga, amnesiac, and radish). Three of these mutations cause cyclic AMP signaling defects and significantly reduced taste discrimination. The exception was radish, which affects neither. Electrophysiological recordings confirmed that the sensitivity of taste receptors is almost indistinguishable in all flies, whether wild type or mutant. These results suggest that food choice behavior in Drosophila involves central nervous learning and memory operating via cyclic AMP signaling pathways. 3aDrosophila 3acyclic AMP 3aelectrophysiology 3afood choices 3amemory 3amutants 3amutation 3aradishes 3asignal transduction 3asucrose 3ataste receptors 3ataste sensitivity1 aKoganezawa, Masayuki 1 aNarikawa, Satoko 1 aFuruyama, Akira 1 aShinozaki, Kenji 1 aIsono, Kunio 1 aShimada, Tsukuba.0 tJournal of comparative physiology.g2007 Feb., v. 193, no. 2 p.279-283dBerlin/Heidelberg : Springer-Verlagx0340-75947nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00359-006-0200-z3electronic resource  a20070128b20070202c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle01767naa a2200265 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002800145245009600173300001600269500002400285520092500309650002001234650001201254650001501266700002701281773010101308852000901409856004801418990002301466655001201489IND4440405420221120021344.0100723e201008  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444040542DNAL7 a10.1007/s10961-009-9126-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGöktepe-Hulten, Devrim10aInventing and patenting activities of scientists: in the expectation of money or reputation  ap. 401-423.  aIncludes references  aWe propose that scientists use patents/invention disclosures as signals to gain reputation than financial benefits.

We find that expectation of gaining financial benefits are not related with the patenting activities of scientists without industrial cooperation. Instead, their expectation to gain/increase reputation through commercial activities is correlated with their patenting and disclosures activities. This may in turn also increase the possibility to gain academic promotion, financial benefits through industrial collaboration etc., rather than the immediate personal financial gains. 3adata collection 3apatents 3ascientists1 aMahagaonkar, Prashanth0 tJournal of technology transfer.g2010 Aug., v. 35, no. 4 p.401-423dSpringer USx0892-99127nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10961-009-9126-2  mNon-PubAg articles 7aarticle02064naa a2200373 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100002500115245007500140300001400215300002200229520098600251650001601237650001701253650001701270650002501287650002501312651001201337653001901349653002801368653003601396653002301432653002601455700002001481700002301501773009101524852000901615939003301624945000801657946001301665655001201678991610227010742620221120021409.0810108e198012  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI810001402DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCarlisle, Johnnie C.10aFood preferences and connotative meaning of foods of Alabama teenagers  ap. 19-26.  ap. 19-26. charts.  aSignificant differences in food preferences and food connotations with respect to sex, race, social class and grade were observed in 354 Alabama high school students. Preferred foods chosen all or most of the time by 75% or more of the students included rolls, French fries, iced tea, fried chicken, hamburger and soda pop. Least preferred foods were cottage cheese, pork and beef liver, and buttermilk. Blacks preferred a greater variety of foods than whites. Females preferred black-eyed peas, spaghetti and lettuce salad more than males. Food preferences significantly correlated with food connotative meanings indicated by at least 1 set of polar terms such as "young-old," "male-female," and "sick-well," for most of 32 selected foods; foods highly preferred by teenagers correlated strongly with foods connotating the meaning "young." Thus, food preferences are associated with the connotative meanings of foods, and this should be considered in nutrition education programs. 3aadolescents 3afood choices 3afood beliefs 3ahigh school students 3apsychosocial factors 3aAlabama 0aFood attitudes 0aFood preference ratings 0aInstructional program divisions 0aRacial differences 0aSex (Characteristics)1 aBass, Mary Ann.1 aOwsley, Douglas W.0 tSchool foodservice research review.g1980 Winter, v. 4, no. 1 p.19-26x0149-68087nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19810108c00000000  aFNC  aOther US 7aarticle02133naa a2200385 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100002300115245010100138300001400239300002200253520098600275650001201261650002401273650002101297650002601318650002801344650002401372650001701396651001301413653002501426653002401451653003601475700002401511700002301535700002301558773009101581852000901672939003301681945000801714946001301722655001201735991610226800742620221120021432.0810108e198012  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI810001412DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKende, Gabriele F.10aNutrition education and training needs of Michigan school food service directors and supervisors  ap. 27-33.  ap. 27-33. charts.  aA questionnaire survey of 142 school food service directors and supervisors demonstrated that only 21% had any post-high school education in food and nutrition. These respondents provide little nutrition education either to their school food service personnel or to students. However, most did not indicate a need for training. Interest in these food service concerns was expressed: increasing school lunch participation; improving public relations for school lunch; sharing lunch themes; reducing plate waste; and merchandising school lunch. Weight loss diets and nutrition education for food service staff were the only 2 nutrition topics of interest. Most directors preferred 1-day school-year workshops to 3-5 day summer workshops. This assessment indicates a great need for nutrition education and training of food service managerial personnel, despite their lack of awareness of such a need. Survey results may be useful in the design of such training programs and workshops. 3asurveys 3anutrition education 3aneeds assessment 3afood service training 3afood service management 3aschool food service 3aschool lunch 3aMichigan 0asupervisory training 0aInservice education 0aSchool food service supervisors1 aPerkowski, Susan J.1 aLackey, Carolyn J.1 aKolasa, Kathryn M.0 tSchool foodservice research review.g1980 Winter, v. 4, no. 1 p.27-33x0149-68087nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19810108c00000000  aFNC  aOther US 7aarticle02110naa a2200385 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100002400115245007800139300001400217300002800231520098100259650002101240650001701261650001801278650001701296650002401313653001601337653001801353653004301371653002301414653003501437653002601472653001701498700002001515700002301535773009101558852000901649939003301658945000801691946001301699655001201712991610226560742620221117170251.0810108e198012  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI810001442DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBalintfy, Joseph L.14aThe effect of preference-maximized menus on consumption of school lunches  ap. 48-53.  ap. 48-53. charts, form.  aPreference-maximized meal planning, developed with surveys and computer programs which mathematically predicted the maximum preference of food items as a function of their frequency on school lunch menus, significantly increased school lunch participation and food consumption. Preferences were maximized subject to frequency limitations imposed by budget and Type A pattern requirements. Preference-maximized and control menus were served alternately in a 12 week double-blind experiment. Both menus satisfied Type A pattern, but the programmed menus used student preferences to maximum advantage. Serving size and plate waste of each menu item was measured for each of 1782 students in 2 schools. When maximized menus were served, plate waste and food costs decreased as compared with controls. Thus, computer technology may be successfully applied to predict students' food preferences and translate these preferences directly into cost-effective Type A school lunch menus. 3afood consumption 3afood choices 3amenu planning 3aschool lunch 3acomputer techniques 0aplate waste 0ameal patterns 0aComputer Assisted Menu Planning (CAMP) 0aFood cost analysis 0aFood economics and consumption 0aSchool lunch programs 0aType A lunch1 aRumpf, David L.1 aSinha, Prabhakant.0 tSchool foodservice research review.g1980 Winter, v. 4, no. 1 p.48-53x0149-68087nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19810108c00000000  aFNC  aOther US 7aarticle02257naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002700145245012100172300001600293520114300309650001901452650002101471650001301492650001301505650001501518650001501533650001501548700002101563700001801584700001901602700002301621773012901644852000901773856006901782930003301851946001101884655001201895IND4387228220221117170325.0070128e200702  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438722822DNAL7 a10.1007/s00359-006-0177-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCarrington, Elizabeth 10aManipulating the light/dark cycle: effects on dopamine levels in optic lobes of the honey bee (Apis mellifera) brain  ap. 167-180.  aThis study examines the relationship between cyclical variations in optic-lobe dopamine levels and the circadian behavioural rhythmicity exhibited by forager bees. Our results show that changing the light-dark regimen to which bees are exposed has a significant impact not only on forager behaviour, but also on the levels of dopamine that can be detected in the optic lobes of the brain. Consistent with earlier reports, we show that foraging behaviour exhibits properties characteristic of a circadian rhythm. Foraging activity is entrained by daily light cycles to periods close to 24 h, it changes predictably in response to phase shifts in light, and it is able to free-run under constant conditions. Dopamine levels in the optic lobes also undergo cyclical variations, and fluctuations in endogenous dopamine levels are influenced significantly by alterations to the light/dark cycle. However, the time course of these changes is markedly different from changes observed at a behavioural level. No direct correlation could be identified between levels of dopamine in the optic lobes and circadian rhythmic activity of the honey bee. 3aApis mellifera 3acircadian rhythm 3adopamine 3aforaging 3ahoney bees 3aoptic lobe 3aphysiology1 aKokay, Ilona C. 1 aDuthie, Jane 1 aLewis, Robert 1 aMercer, Alison R. 0 tJournal of comparative physiology.g2007 Feb., v. 193, no. 2 p.167-180dBerlin/Heidelberg : Springer-Verlagx0340-75947nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00359-006-0177-73electronic resource  a20070128b20070202c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle01360naa a2200289 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100002000115245004200135300001600177500001800193520055300211650002000764650002400784650003000808650002300838653001900861653002200880773009300902852000900995939003301004945000801037946001301045655001201058991610226440742620221117170333.0830630e198206  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI830019422DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRoach, Faith R.10aFood production management: An update  ap. 120-125.  aBibliography.  aAn annotated bibliography presents 74 references (books and journal articles) categorized under 5 areas related to food production management: food quality; menu planning considerations; productivity; production planning and forecasting; and general.

This is in response to the recognition that conventional fisheries management is not equipped to deal with the complexities, uncertainties and challenges prevalent in small-scale fishery systems. Consequently, a new fisheries paradigm is emerging based on the principles and ideas underpinning systems thinking, complexity theory, participatory democracy and adaptive management. Although fishery science is required to inform management decisions, it must be seen as one of the inputs needed for effective governance. Incorporation of other disciplinary perspectives, knowledge sources and local information is considered necessary for understanding the fishery system and identifying appropriate management responses. Although South Africa has incorporated many of these ideas and principles into broad policies and legislation governing resource management, implementation of this new paradigm in the context of small-scale fisheries is proving difficult. However, recent developments such as the recognition of the socio-economic rights of this group of fishers, the formulation of a new draft small-scale fisheries policy, efforts to identify and address human dimensions in fisheries through research and stakeholder workshops, as well as opportunities for greater participation in policy formulation and management, are all indicative of a shift in institutional culture and approach to this sector. This paper aims to provide an overview of the main ideas underpinning the new small-scale fisheries paradigm and explores the application of these ideas in the context of small-scale fisheries in South Africa. Challenges and prospects for implementing this new management paradigm are discussed, as well as some practical ideas for progressing this new approach.  aPublisher supplied data 3afisheries 3afisheries management 3agovernance 3ahumans 3aissues and policy 3alaws and regulations 3aresource management 3asocioeconomics 3astakeholders 3aSouth Africa 0acomplex 0agovernance 0ainter-disciplinary 0apolicy 0asocio-ecological systems 0atraditional fishers0 tAfrican journal of marine science.g2011 Aug. 1, v. 33, no. 2 p.297-311dTaylor & Francis Groupx1814-23387nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2989/1814232X.2011.602875  aDNAL 7aarticle02228naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100005500151245007600206300001600282520080300298592002801101650001901129650002001148650002201168650002301190650001401213650001801227650001401245653001301259653002801272653002901300653002801329653002801357700005501385700005801440700005601498700005501554773011401609856008601723852000901809655001201818IND60738585920221116140139.0210812e202109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073858592DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tplants.2021.05.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDong, An-Yu1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4421-324610aBioinformatic tools support decision-making in plant disease management  ap. 953-967.  aFood loss due to pathogens is a major concern in agriculture, requiring the need for advanced disease detection and prevention measures to minimize pathogen damage to plants.

Developing highly efficient nonfluorinated superoleophilic separation materials for oil/water separation is urgently needed. Herein, a natural Juncus effusus pith was directly used as a raw material to prepare novel separation columns via a facile compression strategy. The pith possessed natural superoleophilicity (oil contact angle almost 0°) with inherent oleophilic properties and regular multilayer, porous, network structure. These pith characteristics endowed related separation columns with superior oil selectivity. The pore size of the prepared columns was controlled by adjusting the degree of compression. In this strategy, the separation eﬃciency the column reached up to 99.99 and 97.7% for eight types of oil/water mixtures and surfactant-stabilized emulsions under gravity, respectively. After repeated column recycling, these columns retained excellent separation performance and the separation mechanism was investigated. No new pollutants and hazardous substances were introduced into the environment in column fabrication and separation processes. Therefore, this study provided the basis for an ecofriendly, low-cost, and scalable strategy for reasonable utilization of natural biomaterials with superoleophilicity, thus exhibiting great potential for the rapid treatment of oil spillage and industrial oily wastewater.  aPublisher supplied data 3aJuncus effusus 3abiocompatible materials 3acontact angle 3agravity 3ahumans 3ahydrophobicity 3aoil spills 3aoils 3apith 3aporosity 3araw materials 3awastewater 0aJuncus effusus 0a3-Dimensional network 0aSuperoleophilicity 0aOil/water separation 0aCycle stability1 aRen, Luyao1 aWang, Jianyou1 aLu, Huixia1 aHao, Lan0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2022 Feb. 01, v. 334 p.130037-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2021.1300373Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02528naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245008900170500001900259520126900278592002801547650002401575650001401599650001701613650001501630650001101645650002301656650002101679650002801700653001901728653004001747653003201787653003101819653002101850700001601871700005901887773009001946856008502036852000902121655001202130IND60720597820221119065217.0210305e20210315xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072059782DNAL7 a10.1016/j.energy.2020.1195642doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJilte, Ravindra12aA novel battery thermal management system using nano-enhanced phase change materials  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe production of alternative clean energy vehicles provides a sustainable solution to the transportation sector. An efficient battery cooling system is necessary for safer usage of electric cars during their life cycle. The current work presents a novel modified battery module configuration employing two-layer nanoparticle enhanced phase change materials (nePCM). The design suggests m × n × p arrangement where m denotes the number of Li-ion 18,650 cells, n and p refer to the number of primary containers (filled with nePCM1) and secondary containers (filled with nePCM2). Each Li-ion cell was allowed to discharge at 3C condition for two different configurations: 7 × 7 × 1 and 7 × 1 × 1. The study involves a cooling performance comparison of proposed battery thermal management systems (BTMS) at an ambient temperature ranging from 30 °C to 40 °C with external natural convection conditions. The transient development of heat in batteries and the melting behavior of nePCMs shows better cooling performance for the 7 × 7 × 1 case. BTMS based on 7 × 7 × 1 configuration maintains the cell temperature below 46 °C with combined nePCM and external natural convection cooling even at the hot ambient temperature of 40 °C.  aPublisher supplied data 3aambient temperature 3abatteries 3aclean energy 3aconvection 3aenergy 3amanagement systems 3aphase transition 3atransportation industry 0aLi-ion battery 0aNano-enhanced phase change material 0aMulti-shell battery cooling 0aTransient thermal response 0aMelting fraction1 aAfzal, Asif1 aPanchal, Satyam1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8152-04510 tEnergy.g2021 Mar. 15, v. 219 p.119564-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12436x0360-54427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2020.1195643Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01987naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002000148245013600168300001600304520078000320592002801100650001601128650002001144650001001164650002201174653002601196653002601222653001001248653001401258653001401272700002301286700002301309700002001332700001601352700002101368773012101389856008201510852000901592655001201601IND60089840320221119132531.0160728e20131213xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008984032DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbrc.2013.11.0422doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLien, Huang-Wei10aZinc finger protein 219-like (ZNF219L) and Sox9a regulate synuclein-γ2 (sncgb) expression in the developing notochord of zebrafish  ap. 189-194.  aZebrafish synuclein-γ2 (sncgb) has been reported to be expressed specifically in the notochord. However, the mechanism by which the sncgb gene promoter is regulated has not been described. In this paper, we demonstrate that Zinc finger protein 219-like (ZNF219L) and sox9a are involved in the regulation of sncgb gene expression. Furthermore, we observed that over-expression of both ZNF219L and Sox9a resulted in increased sncgb expression. In addition, ZNF219L is physically associated with Sox9a, and simultaneous morpholino knockdown of znf219L and sox9a caused a synergistic decrease of sncgb expression in the notochord. Taken together, our results reveal that coordination of ZNF219L with Sox9a is involved in the regulation of notochord-specific expression of sncgb.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDanio rerio 3agene expression 3agenes 3azinc finger motif 0aSynuclein-γ2 (sncgb) 0aZNF219-like (ZNF219L) 0aSox9a 0aNotochord 0aZebrafish1 aYang, Chung-Hsiang1 aCheng, Chia-Hsiung1 aLiao, Yung-Feng1 aHan, Yu-San1 aHuang, Chang-Jen0 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2013 Dec. 13, v. 442 p.189-194dElsevier Inc.x0006-291X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2013.11.0423Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02247naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001300140245011100153300002000264520114500284592002801429650002201457650001901479650001601498650001301514650001501527700001501542700001601557700001701573700001301590700001501603700001301618700001801631700001701649773012401666856007401790852000901864655001201873IND60664191620221118020941.0190910e20121029xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066419162DNAL7 a10.1039/c2ra22198e2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXu, Feng10aHybrid single/poly-crystalline ZnO nanoawl arrays: facile synthesis and enhanced field emission properties  ap. 11601-11606.  aArrays of hybrid single/poly-crystalline ZnO nanoawls (HSP-ZNAs) composed of single-crystalline ZnO nanorod (ZNR) holders and poly-crystalline nanoneedles were for the first time fabricated via a facile two-step synthesis strategy that was based on firstly an aqueous electrodeposition and secondly an aqueous chemical growth (ACG). The two-step synthesis strategy not only can ensure reliable electrical contact between the ZNR holders and the substrates, but also can afford control over the crystal structure and aspect ratio of the nanoneedles. The as-grown HSP-ZNA arrays exhibited markedly enhanced field emission (FE) current at lower electric fields compared with the whole single-crystalline ZNA arrays or ZNR arrays without nanoneedles. The improvement could be attributed to more emission sites from the tips of poly-crystalline nanoneedles of the HSP-ZNAs. Our results demonstrate the HSP-ZNA arrays one of the promising candidates for FE devices, and also provide a new paradigm for synthesizing novel hybrid single/poly-crystalline nanostructures that could find many potential applications in electronics and optoelectronics.  aPublisher supplied data 3acrystal structure 3aelectric field 3aelectronics 3ananorods 3azinc oxide1 aChen, Jing1 aDi, Yunsong1 aCui, Yunkang1 aSun, Jun1 aSun, Litao1 aLei, Wei1 aXu, Chunxiang1 aZhou, Weilie0 tRSC advances.g2012 Oct. 29, v. 2, no. 30 p.11601-11606dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c2ra22198e3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03199naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002600140245011400166500001400280520206200294592002802356650001302384650001202397650002202409650002002431650001302451650002002464650002102484650001902505650001802524650001902542650001302561650001002574650002902584773012902613856007402742852000902816655001202825IND60707960820221123041456.0200821e20200811xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070796082DNAL7 a10.3390/rs121625862doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBurdziakowski, Pawel 12aA Novel Method for the Deblurring of Photogrammetric Images Using Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks  aNAL-light  aThe visual data acquisition from small unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) may encounter a situation in which blur appears on the images. Image blurring caused by camera motion during exposure significantly impacts the images interpretation quality and consequently the quality of photogrammetric products. On blurred images, it is difficult to visually locate ground control points, and the number of identified feature points decreases rapidly together with an increasing blur kernel. The nature of blur can be non-uniform, which makes it hard to forecast for traditional deblurring methods. Due to the above, the author of this publication concluded that the neural methods developed in recent years were able to eliminate blur on UAV images with an unpredictable or highly variable blur nature. In this research, a new, rapid method based on generative adversarial networks (GANs) was applied for deblurring. A data set for neural network training was developed based on real aerial images collected over the last few years. More than 20 full sets of photogrammetric products were developed, including point clouds, orthoimages and digital surface models. The sets were generated from both blurred and deblurred images using the presented method. The results presented in the publication show that the method for improving blurred photo quality significantly contributed to an improvement in the general quality of typical photogrammetric products. The geometric accuracy of the products generated from deblurred photos was maintained despite the rising blur kernel. The quality of textures and input photos was increased. This research proves that the developed method based on neural networks can be used for deblur, even in highly blurred images, and it significantly increases the final geometric quality of the photogrammetric products. In practical cases, it will be possible to implement an additional feature in the photogrammetric software, which will eliminate unwanted blur and allow one to use almost all blurred images in the modelling process.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaccuracy 3acameras 3acomputer software 3adata collection 3ageometry 3aneural networks 3aorthophotography 3aphotogrammetry 3arapid methods 3aremote sensing 3aresearch 3aseeds 3aunmanned aerial vehicles0 tRemote Sensing.g2020 Aug. 11, v. 12, no. 16dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:26717x2072-42927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs121625863Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02590naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094024002200130024001900152040001800171100002200189245009500211300001800306506007600324520103300400592002801433596004301461506003701504650000901541650002701550650001101577650001101588650001101599650002601610650001401636650002401650650001501674650002301689650001501712650001601727650001301743650001901756700003001775700002001805700006001825773013201885856008202017852000902099655001202108IND60635558920221207073903.0190402e201904  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063555892DNAL7 a10.1007/s13197-019-03657-12doi7 aPMC64437572pmcid7 a309964272pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShanker, Niharika10aMoisture sorption characteristics of ready-to-eat snack food enriched with purslane leaves  ap. 1918-1926.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aGreen leafy vegetables are important part of our regular diet that provides us with essential nutrients necessary to support human life and health. Since these are produced in surplus and have limited shelf-life, preservation of vegetables can help to prevent wastage and increase nutrient availability in the diet during off-season. Purslane leaves, rich in micronutrients were dried using tray dryer at 60 ± 2 °C for 7 h. and incorporated at 20% level in khakhra. Organoleptic and physico-chemical properties of the product were evaluated. Further, the sorption properties of khakhra, were studied at 27 ± 2 °C over a range of water activity of 0.10–0.92. Several models were chosen to fit sorption behavior, but the Peleg model showed the best fit. The present study in fact provides a platform to understand the rationalities behind the physico-chemical changes in the product, which, in turn, helps in predicting the best suitable packaging material for storage in addition to the stability of the product.  aPublisher supplied data  aRF -0472cUniversity Grants Commission0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3adiet 3agreen leafy vegetables 3ahumans 3aleaves 3amodels 3anutrient availability 3anutrients 3apackaging materials 3aprediction 3aready-to-eat foods 3ashelf life 3asnack foods 3asorption 3awater activity1 aManeesh Kumar, Mediboyina1 aJuvvi, Praneeth1 aDebnath, Sukumar1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5160-30930 tJournal of food science and technology.g2019 Apr., v. 56, no. 4 p.1918-1926dSpringer IndiawJournal:jnl16929x0022-11557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13197-019-03657-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01568naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001500140245014100155300001800296520032200314592002800636650001900664650001200683650001800695650001500713650002200728650001200750650002000762650002000782700002100802700001300823700001500836700001300851700001400864700001600878700002000894700001100914700001700925773012100942856007401063852000901137655001201146IND60664191820221118020932.0190910e20130114xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066419182DNAL7 a10.1039/c2ra22202g2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Chao10aGas leaching as a path to build hierarchical core–corona porous alumina nanostructures with extraordinary pollutant treatment capacity  ap. 1699-1702.  aHierarchical core–corona porous γ-Al₂O₃ nanostructures have been synthesized through the reaction of toluene diluted TMA with water by controlling the methane leaching.

Their commercial success depends on cost-effective purification processes. Membrane chromatography processes offer great potential for virus purification, however conventional devices are known to suffer from issues related to resolution and sample dilution. Laterally-fed membrane chromatography (LFMC) overcomes these issues by minimizing the dead-volume and establishing a uniform flow distribution pattern within the device. While the efficiency of LFMC has been previously demonstrated for protein purification studies, here we present a direct comparison of the performance of a LFMC device and a conventional radial flow device (both containing 1 mL of the same strong anion-exchange membrane) for the purification of adenoviruses. Using a gradient elution strategy, a 74% virus recovery with 4% of residual amount of total protein and 1% residual amount of total DNA was obtained using the LFMC device; for the radial flow device, only 20% virus recovery was achieved for a similar level of purity. Using a stepwise elution strategy, close to 100% virus recovery with 10% residual protein and DNA was achieved with both devices. However, the product was at least 50% more dilute with the radial flow device. Overall, this study demonstrates the considerable benefits of using LFMC over conventional membrane chromatography devices for purifying virus-based biotherapeutics.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAdenoviridae 3aDNA 3aanion-exchange membranes 3achromatography 3acost effectiveness 3aneoplasms 3aprotein content 3apurification methods 3atherapeutics 3aviruses 3avolume1 aMadadkar, Pedram1 aUmatheva, Umatheny1 aShoaebargh, Shabnam1 aMedina, Maria Fe C.1 aLichty, Brian D.1 aGhosh, Raja1 aLatulippe, David R.0 tJournal of membrane science.g2019 June 01, v. 579 p.351-358dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12468x0376-73887nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.memsci.2019.02.0563Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03326naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245015200159500001500311520183200326592002802158650002802186650001502214650001102229650001602240650001002256650001902266650001102285650002302296650001102319650001602330650001102346650001802357650001602375650002102391650002102412650001602433650002402449651001002473700001302483700001702496700001702513700001702530700001802547700001702565700001402582773012902596856007402725852000902799655001202808IND60707961020221120120134.0200821e20200805xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070796102DNAL7 a10.3390/rs121625162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aQiao, Shufeng 14aThe Effect of Water Transfer during Non-growing Season on the Wetland Ecosystem via Surface and Groundwater Interactions in Arid Northwestern China  agolden set  aThe use of ecological water transfer to maintain the ecological environment in arid or semiarid regions has become an important means of human intervention to alleviate vegetation ecosystem degradation in arid and semiarid areas. The water transfer to downstream in a catchment is often carried out during the non-growing season, due to the competitive water use between the upper and middle reaches and lower reaches of rivers. However, the impacts and mechanism of artificial water transfer on vegetation and wetland ecosystem restoration have not been thoroughly investigated, especially in northwest China. Taking the Qingtu Lake wetland system in the lower reaches of the Shiyang River Catchment as the study area, this study analyzed the spatial and temporal distribution surface area of Qingtu Lake and the surrounding vegetation coverage before and after water transfer, by interpreting remote sensing data, the variation of water content in the vadose zone, and the groundwater level by obtaining field monitoring data, as well as the correlation between the water body area of Qingtu Lake and the highest vegetation coverage area in the following year. The conclusion is that there is a positive correlation between the water body area of Qingtu Lake in autumn and the vegetation coverage in each fractional vegetation coverage (FVC) interval in the next summer, especially in terms of the FVC of 30–50%. The groundwater level and soil water content increase after water transfer and remain relatively high for the following months, which suggests that transferred water from upstream can be stored as groundwater or soil water in the subsurface through surface water and subsurface water interaction. These water sources can provide water for the vegetation growth the next spring, or support plants in the summer.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural watersheds 3aarid zones 3aautumn 3agroundwater 3alakes 3aremote sensing 3arivers 3asoil water content 3aspring 3astream flow 3asummer 3asurface water 3avadose zone 3avegetation cover 3awater management 3awater table 3awetland restoration 3aChina1 aMa, Rui 1 aSun, Ziyong 1 aGe, Mengyan 1 aBu, Jianwei 1 aWang, Junyou 1 aWang, Zheng 1 aNie, Han 0 tRemote Sensing.g2020 Aug. 05, v. 12, no. 16dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:26717x2072-42927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs121625163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03487naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001900148245015800167300001600325520164100341592002801982650001202010650001502022650002502037650001702062650001702079650002502096650003602121650002302157650001802180650001702198650001002215650001802225650001602243650001502259650001802274650001302292650001802305650002402323650002402347650002702371653002202398653001202420653001902432653001602451653001502467653002402482700001802506700002902524700002002553700002102573700001502594700002802609700002102637773012302658856008302781852000902864655001202873IND60779778920221120224012.0220921e202209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077977892DNAL7 a10.1016/j.sajb.2022.06.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCüce, Mustafa13aAn evaluation of volatiles and phenolic compounds in conjunction with the antioxidant capacity of endemic endangered species of Erodium hendrikii Alpinar  ap. 458-467.  aThis study considers the chemical composition of an endemic endangered Erodium species (E. hendrikii), which grows naturally in the Turkish flora. The non-polar compounds and fatty acids from air-dried above-ground parts of the plant were analyzed using GC–MS, while phenolic acids and flavonoids were evaluated using UHPLC-MS/MS. Palmitic acid (5.23 mg/g dw) followed by linoleic acid (3.81 mg/g dw) were the major fatty acids, and n-hexadecanal (60.75%, dw) followed by n-tetradecanal (12.99%, dw) were the main non-polar compounds identified in the plant. The major phenolic acids (nmol/g dw) in the plant were protocatechuic acid (90.07) in free, ferulic acid (430.90) in ester, gallic acid (2450.51) in glycoside, and ester-bound (527.05) forms. The crude extract was represented by the highest caffeic acid (3189.56) content. In addition, hesperidin (259.56 nmol/g dw) was determined as the major flavonoid in the crude extract. This crude extract was further fractioned via solid-phase extraction and its three further partial fractions were obtained using water, ethyl acetate, and methanol. The methanol fraction yielded the highest antioxidant capacity among the fractions. A strong correlation and linear regression were determined between the phenolic contents and antioxidant capacity values of the crude extract and the three further partial fractions of the plant. These findings represent the first data concerning the phytochemical composition of E. hendrikii Alpinar and may be useful in the future development of antioxidant and antimicrobial agents for food preservatives against problems of food deterioration.  aPublisher supplied data 3aErodium 3aair drying 3aantioxidant activity 3aantioxidants 3acaffeic acid 3achemical composition 3achemical constituents of plants 3aendangered species 3aethyl acetate 3aferulic acid 3aflora 3afood spoilage 3agallic acid 3ahesperidin 3alinoleic acid 3amethanol 3apalmitic acid 3aprotocatechuic acid 3aregression analysis 3asolid phase extraction 0aErodium hendrikii 0aEndemic 0aPhenolic acids 0aAntioxidant 0aFatty acid 0aNon-polar compounds1 aColak, Nesrin1 aĆavar Zeljković, Sanja1 aTarkowski, Petr1 aStrnad, Miroslav1 aGruz, Jiri1 aVehbi İmamoğlu, Kemal1 aAyaz, Faik Ahmet0 tSouth African journal of botany.g2022 Sept., v. 149 p.458-467dElsevier B.V.aSAABwJournal:jnl34108x0254-62997nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.sajb.2022.06.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03107naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100003600150245010200186300001600288520175400304592002802058650002202086650001702108650001702125650001902142650001802161650002702179650001502206650001802221650001502239650003002254650001802284651001102302653002502313653002102338653001502359653002902374653001402403653001702417653001902434700002202453773011402475856005102589852000902640655001202649IND50086816920221121004139.0140412e20110401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5008681692DNAL7 a10.1080/09064710.2010.4902332doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKværnø, Sigrun Hjalmarsdottir10aPerformance of pedotransfer functions in predicting soil water characteristics of soils in Norway  ap. 264-280.  aPedotransfer functions (PTFs), predicting the soil water retention curve (SWRC) from basic soil physical properties, need to be validated on arable soils in Norway. In this study we compared the performance of PTFs developed by Riley (1996), Rawls and Brakensiek (1989), Vereecken et al. (1989), Wösten et al. (1999) and Schaap et al. (2001). We compared SWRCs calculated using textural composition, organic matter content (SOM) and bulk density as input to these PTFs to pairs of measured water content and matric potential. The measured SWRCs and PTF input data were from 540 soil horizons on agricultural land in Norway. We used various statistical indicators to evaluate the PTFs, including an integrated index by Donatelli et al. (2004). The Riley PTFs showed good overall performance. The soil specific version of Riley is preferred over the layer specific, as the latter may introduce a negative change in water content with increasing matric potential (h). Among the parameter PTFs, Wösten's continuous PTF showed the overall best performance, closely followed by Rawls&B and Vereecken. The ANN-based continuous PTF of Schaap showed poorer performance than its regression based counterparts. Systematic errors related to both particle size and SOM caused the class PTFs to perform poorly; these PTFs do not use SOM as input, and are therefore inappropriate for soils in Norway, being highly variable in SOM. The PTF performance showed little difference between soil groups. Water contents in the dry range of the SWRC were generally better predicted than water contents in the wet range. Pedotransfer functions that included both SOM and measured bulk density as input, i.e. Wösten, Vereecken and Rawls&B, performed best in the wet range.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural land 3aarable soils 3abulk density 3aorganic matter 3aparticle size 3apedotransfer functions 3aprediction 3asoil horizons 3asoil water 3asoil water characteristic 3awater content 3aNorway 0aSoil water retention 0amatric potential 0acomparison 0acontinuous parameter PTF 0aclass PTF 0asoil texture 0aorganic matter1 aHaugen, Lars Egil0 tActa agriculturæ Scandinavica.g2011 Apr. 1, v. 61, no. 3 p.264-280dTaylor & Francis Groupx1651-19137nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09064710.2010.490233  aDNAL 7aarticle02822naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003700092040001800129100002800147245010600175300001600281500024100297500001500538520132700553592002801880650001901908650002601927650002701953650001201980650001801992650001902010650001802029650001902047650001502066650002602081650001902107651001102126653001102137700001802148700002202166773011902188852000902307856008402316655001202400IND4438209720221119001538.0181002e201005  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443820972DNAL7 a10.1097/SS.0b013e3181e04a452doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 ada Silva, Rodrigo Coqui10aAvailable Phosphorus Evaluated by Three Soil Tests in a Brazilian Tropical Oxisol Treated With Gypsum  ap. 233-239.  aAffiliations: 1University of Sao Paulo/ESALQ-Department of Soil Science, Piracicaba, Sao Paulo State, Brazil.

The soil was incubated in the laboratory at rates up to 75 g kg of phosphogypsum (PG) containing 0.3% total P, natural gypsum, or reagent-grade gypsum, and up to 100 mg P kg as triple superphosphate (TSP) or phosphate rock (PR). In the greenhouse, two consecutive maize crops were grown on the soil treated with 50 mg P kg of TSP and PG rates up to 75 g kg. The results of the incubation study showed that Mehlich-P and Pi-P increased with increasing PG rate for the treatments of TSP, PR, and control. Resin-HCO3 underestimated available P from TSP and PR because of the reaction between resin-HCO3 and gypsum. Mehlich-1 overestimated available P from PR compared with TSP because of an excessive dissolution of PR by the strongly acidic Mehlich-1. Pi underestimated available P from PR in the treatments of natural and reagent-grade gypsum because of Ca common-ion effect from gypsum on depressing PR dissolution. The results in terms of the effect of PG on available P are similar in both incubation and greenhouse studies. Both Mehlich-P and Pi-P correlated well with P uptake by maize, whereas resin-P did not.  aPublisher supplied data 3atropical soils 3anutrient availability 3afertilizer application 3aOxisols 3asoil analysis 3asoil treatment 3aphosphogypsum 3asoil fertility 3aphosphorus 3atriple superphosphate 3arock phosphate 3aBrazil 0agypsum1 aChien, Sen H.1 aProchnow, Luis I.0 tSoil science.g2010 May, v. 175, no. 5 p.233-239dLippincott Williams & WilkinswJournal:jnl44572x0038-075X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1097/SS.0b013e3181e04a453Available from publisher's site 7aarticle02029naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001500150245011400165300001600279520067200295592002800967650002200995650001701017650001801034650002001052650001201072650000901084650001301093650000901106650002001115650001001135650001201145650001301157653002701170653001401197653002801211653001901239653002801258700002201286700002801308700002401336700002501360773011401385856005101499852000901550655001201559IND50086817020221121014524.0140412e20110401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5008681702DNAL7 a10.1080/09064710.2010.4905352doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGreen, Ole10aReducing the risk of soil compaction by applying ‘Jordværn Online’® when performing slurry distribution  ap. 209-213.  aThrough a case study, it is shown that the potential of applying JORDVÆRN Online® as a decision-making tool aimed at supporting sustainable in-field traffic provided the farmer with the potential to improve and maintain the soil as a continued growth medium for the future agri-food production.

A number of strategies are available for increasing this local concentration, including increasing the capture probe density, using higher affinity binding molecules, or, as presented here, directly conjugating additional initiators to the detection reagent through the use of functionalized polymers. We have previously considered poly(acrylic acid-co-acrylamide) backbones for this purpose; with eosin as the photoinitiator, these efforts were hindered by solubility limitations. Here, we use a poly(amidoamine) dendrimer as a scaffold to produce conjugates with enhanced solubility. Through an investigation into the surface binding and solution-phase properties of these conjugates, we show that quenching effects impact the efficacy of these conjugates as macrophotoinitiators.  aPublisher supplied data 3adendrimers 3adiagnostic techniques 3aeosin 3asolubility1 aSikes, H.

RESULTS: A novel glutamate decarboxylase, BmGAD, from Bacillus megaterium was overexpressed and purified. BmGAD was approximately 53 kDa by SDS-PAGE analysis. Its optimum activity was at pH 5 and 50 °C. BmGAD had a specific activity of 59 ± 5.2 U mg⁻¹ at pH 6, which is the highest value reported so far. The apparent Km and Vₘₐₓ values of BmGAD were 8 ± 0.5 mM and 150 ± 4.7 U mg⁻¹, respectively. Through site-directed mutagenesis, two BmGAD mutants (E294R and H467A) showed higher Vₘₐₓ values than that of wild-type, with the values of 210 ± 6.9 and 180 ± 4.1 U mg⁻¹ at pH 5 and 50 °C, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The unusual high activity of BmGAD at pH 6 makes it an attractive GABA-producing candidate in industrial application.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacillus megaterium 3agamma-aminobutyric acid 3aglutamate decarboxylase 3ahosts 3aindustrial applications 3amutants 3apH 3apolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis 3asite-directed mutagenesis1 aCheng, Haijiao1 aMa, Xiaoqian1 aXu, Ning1 aLiu, Jun1 aMa, Yanhe0 tBiotechnology letters.g2016 July, v. 38, no. 7 p.1107-1113dSpringer Netherlandsx0141-54927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10529-016-2070-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03511naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094024002200125024001900147040001800166100002400184245013500208300001600343506007600359520194000435592002802375506003702403650001802440650001102458650001502469650003202484650001802516650001702534650001102551650000802562650002002570650001402590650001202604650002202616650001002638650000902648653002002657653002102677653001502698653001402713653001602727700002102743700002302764773012002787856007702907852000902984655001202993IND60620257920221207113331.0181107e20160711xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062025792DNAL7 a10.3945/an.116.0125182doi7 aPMC49428742pmcid7 a274225082pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHennigar, Stephen R10aMetallothionein and Zinc Transporter Expression in Circulating Human Blood Cells as Biomarkers of Zinc Status: a Systematic Review  ap. 735-746.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aZinc is an essential nutrient for humans; however, a sensitive biomarker to assess zinc status has not been identified. The objective of this systematic review was to compile and assess studies that determined zinc transporter and/or metallothionein expression in various blood cell types and to determine their reliability and sensitivity to changes in dietary zinc. Sixteen studies were identified that determined the expression of zrt-, irt-like protein (ZIP) 1 [solute carrier family (SLC) 39A1], ZIP3 (SLC39A3), ZIP5 (SLC39A5), ZIP6 (SLC39A6), ZIP7 (SLC39A7), ZIP8 (SLC39A8), ZIP10 (SLC39A10), ZIP14 (SLC39A14), zinc transporter (ZnT)1 (SLC30A1), ZnT2 (SLC30A2), ZnT4 (SLC30A4), ZnT5 (SLC30A5), ZnT6 (SLC30A6), ZnT7 (SLC30A7), ZnT9 (SLC30A9), and/or metallothionein in various blood cells isolated from healthy adult men and women in response to zinc supplementation or depletion. Cell types included leukocytes, peripheral blood mononuclear cells, T lymphocytes, monocytes, and erythrocytes. ZIP1, ZnT1, and metallothionein were the most commonly measured proteins. Changes in ZIP1 and ZnT1 in response to zinc supplementation or depletion were not consistent across studies. Leukocyte metallothionein decreased with zinc depletion (−39% change from baseline, <5 mg Zn/d, n = 2 studies) and increased with zinc supplementation in a dose-dependent manner (35%, 15–22 mg Zn/d, n = 7 studies; 267%, 50 mg Zn/d, n = 2 studies) and at the earliest time points measured; however, no change or delayed response was observed in metallothionein in erythrocytes. A greater percentage of studies demonstrated that metallothionein in leukocyte subtypes was a more reliable (100%, n = 12; 69%, n = 16) and responsive (92%, n = 12; 82%, n = 11) indicator of zinc exposure than was plasma zinc, respectively. In conclusion, current evidence indicates that metallothionein in leukocyte subtypes may be a component in determining zinc status.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aT-lymphocytes 3aadults 3abiomarkers 3adietary mineral supplements 3adose response 3aerythrocytes 3ahumans 3amen 3ametallothionein 3amonocytes 3asolutes 3asystematic review 3awomen 3azinc 0ametallothionein 0azinc transporter 0aleukocytes 0abiomarker 0azinc status1 aKelley, Alyssa M1 aMcClung, James P.,0 tAdvances in nutrition.g2016 July 11, v. 7, no. 4 p.735-746dOxford University PresswJournal:2280x2156-53767nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3945/an.116.0125183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02427naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001700146245015300163300001600316520130900332592002801641650001501669650001601684650001101700650001201711650001101723650001901734653001801753653002201771653002201793653002201815700001601837700001301853773011001866856008001976852000902056655001202065IND60616534520221119044926.0181017e201403  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061653452DNAL7 a10.1177/00405175134959412doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Yanping10aProtective properties of warp-knitted spacer fabrics under impact in hemispherical form. Part I: Impact behavior analysis of a typical spacer fabric  ap. 422-434.  aThis paper presents an experimental study of the protective properties of warp-knitted spacer fabrics developed for protecting the human body on impact. A drop-weight impact tester was used to test the fabrics in a hemispherical form to simulate the use of impact protectors in real life. The study consists of two parts. The first part, presented in the current paper, focuses on the impact behavior of a typical spacer fabric impacted at different levels of energy. The analysis includes the impact process and the energy absorption and force attenuation properties of the spacer fabric. Frequency domain analysis is also used, to identify the different deformation and damage modes of the fabric under various levels of impact energy. The results show that the impact behavior of the fabric under impact in the hemispherical form is different from that in the planar form. The results also indicate that the curvature of the fabric can reduce energy absorption during the impact process and therefore reduce the force attenuation properties of the spacer fabric. This study provides a better understanding of the protective properties of spacer fabrics. The effect of fabric structural parameters and lamination on the protective properties of spacer fabrics under impact will be presented in Part II.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3adeformation 3aenergy 3afabrics 3ahumans 3atextile fibers 0aspacer fabric 0aimpact protection 0aenergy absorption 0atransmitted force1 aAu, Wai Man1 aHu, Hong0 tTextile research journal.g, v. 84, no. 4 p.422-434dSAGE PublicationswJournal:jnl46536x1746-77487nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/00405175134959413Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02794naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002100150245011900171300001600290520131900306592002801625650005001653650001101703650003501714650002501749650001301774650000901787650003101796650001901827650002401846650003201870650000901902650001701911650002001928650001201948653002301960653001301983653002301996653002502019653001302044653001602057700002202073700001902095773010502114856008402219852000902303655001202312IND60581514320221119195907.0171005e201602  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058151432DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecoenv.2015.11.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMohamad, Noorlin10aSource apportionment and health risk assessment of PM10 in a naturally ventilated school in a tropical environment  ap. 351-362.  aThis study aimed to investigate the chemical composition and potential sources of PM10 as well as assess the potential health hazards it posed to school children. PM10 samples were taken from classrooms at a school in Kuala Lumpur's city centre (S1) and one in the suburban city of Putrajaya (S2) over a period of eight hours using a low volume sampler (LVS). The composition of the major ions and trace metals in PM10 were then analysed using ion chromatography (IC) and inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS), respectively. The results showed that the average PM10 concentration inside the classroom at the city centre school (82µg/m3) was higher than that from the suburban school (77µg/m3). Principal component analysis-absolute principal component scores (PCA-APCS) revealed that road dust was the major source of indoor PM10 at both school in the city centre (36%) and the suburban location (55%). The total hazard quotient (HQ) calculated, based on the formula suggested by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA), was found to be slightly higher than the acceptable level of 1, indicating that inhalation exposure to particle-bound non-carcinogenic metals of PM10, particularly Cr exposure by children and adults occupying the school environment, was far from negligible.  aPublisher supplied data 3aUnited States Environmental Protection Agency 3aadults 3aatomic absorption spectrometry 3achemical composition 3achromium 3adust 3ahealth effects assessments 3ahealth hazards 3ainhalation exposure 3aion exchange chromatography 3aions 3aparticulates 3aschool children 3atropics 0aParticulate matter 0aChildren 0aSchool environment 0aChemical composition 0aPCA-APCS 0aHealth risk1 aLatif, Mohd Talib1 aKhan, Md Firoz0 tEcotoxicology and environmental safety.g2016 Feb., v. 124 p.351-362dElsevier Inc.x0147-65137nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoenv.2015.11.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01197naa a2200277 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002000145245005700165300001600222520036300238592002800601650001600629650002200645650001900667700001800686700002000704700001900724773010700743856004800850852000900898655001200907IND4515825720221118032345.0151006e201109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND451582572DNAL7 a10.1134/S10619348110900362doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIvanenko, N.

The evaluation of the effect of HS on milk yield is based on the direct impact of HS on performance. However, in practical terms, HS also exerts its influence during gestation (indirect effect). The main purpose of this study was to identify and characterize the genotype by environment interaction (G × E) due to HS during the last 60 days of gestation (THI_g) and also the HS postpartum (THI_m) over first lactation milk production of Brazilian Holstein cattle. A total of 389 127 test day milk yield (TD) records from 1572 first lactation Holstein cows born in Brazil (daughters of 1248 dams and 70 sires) and the corresponding temperature–humidity index (THI) obtained between December 2007 and January 2013 were analyzed using different random regression models. Cows in the cold environment (THI_g = 64 to 73) during the last 60 days of gestation produced more milk than those cows in a hot environment (THI_g = 74 to 84), particularly during the first 150 days of lactation (DIM). The heritabilities (h²) of TD were similar throughout DIM for cows in THI_g hot (0.11 to 0.20) or (0.10 to 0.22), while the genetic correlations (rg) for TD between these two environments ranged from 0.11 to 0.52 along the first 250 DIM. The h² estimates for TD across THI_m were similar for cows in THI_g hot (0.07 to 0.25) and THI_g cold (0.08 to 0.19). The rg estimates ranged from 0.17 to 0.42 along THI_m between TD of cows in cold and hot THI_g. The results were consistent in demonstrating the existence of an additional source of G × E for TD due to THI_g and THI_m. The present study is probably the first to provide evidence of this source of G × E; further research is needed because of its importance when the breeding objective is to select animals that are more tolerant to HS.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHolstein 3acold 3acold zones 3agenotype-environment interaction 3aheat stress 3alactation 3amilk 3amilk yield 3apregnancy 3aBrazil 0agenetic parameters 0areaction norm 0atemperature–humidity index 0athermal stress1 aPereira, R.

Some general concepts related to proteins are overviewed followed by the discussion of the characteristics and composition of oilseeds and oilseed meal. The techniques and methodologies used to extract and isolate plant proteins and their formulation for specific applications are also reviewed, including measures to minimize the presence of antinutritional or toxic compounds in the isolates. A valorisation of protein isolates, in particular from rapeseed, with regard to their nutritional and functional properties is presented as well. It is possible to produce innumerous added-value proteins products from industrial by-products of oilseed oil production with applications in food and pharmaceutical industries, developing and applying innovative technologies providing environmentally sustainable solutions for agriculture and agro-industry.  aPublisher supplied data 3acrop production 3aprotein isolates 3avegetable protein 3aprotein sources 3aoilseed protein 3avegetable oil 3aindustrial byproducts 3afood industry 3anutritive value 3aoilmeals 3aplant extracts 3aoilseed crops 3avalue-added products 3afunctional properties 3asustainable agriculture 3arapeseed 0aproteins1 aCoelho, Jorge F.J.1 aCarvalho, M.

However, various types of surge tanks differently reflect in reducing water hammer and improve performance of HGS. This study aims to analyze the different performance of Air Chamber Tank (ACT) and Orifice Surge Tank (OST) during the successive load rejection process (SULRP). In this study, the mathematical model of the ACT is established and use to analysing the replacement the existing OST in Shitouxia Hydropower station consisting in three parallel unit system.A modified NSGA-II algorithm is used to perform multiple objective optimization ACT properties and to minimize pressure head in ACT and water head at the inlet of units. The optimization result indicates that the proper selection of initial indoor air height and delay time lead to the decrease maximum water head and fluctuation period in surge tank and falls in overspeed and pressure head at inlet of unit. The results show that, the diameter of ACT can be 2 m smaller than the existing OST and it can decrease the fluctuation period from 130 s to 110.7 s while slightly increasing the overspeed in the last unit. The increasing delay time of the closing guide vane of last unit decreases the water fluctuation in ACT and OST and the maximum water fluctuation in OST and ACT reduce with slope −6.2% and −15% when ΔTd is in range of [14,25] seconds. Finally, the optimized dimension of ACT and OST provides essential guidance for decision-makers to deal with hydraulic transient in SULRP.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3aalgorithms 3adecision making 3aenergy conversion 3amathematical models 3awater power 0aAir chamber tank 0aOrifice surge tank 0aInitial indoor air height 0aNSGA-II 0aSuccessive load rejection1 aDuan, Yiming1 aEgusquiza, Mònica1 aXu, Beibei1 aChen, Diyi1 aEgusquiza, Eduard0 tEnergy conversion and management.g2021 Sept. 15, v. 244 p.114449-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11831x0196-89047nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enconman.2021.1144493Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01406naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001700144245006400161300001600225520048200241592002800723650001300751650002500764650002000789650003100809650001300840650002300853700001300876700001700889773009900906856007801005852000901083655001201092IND60690241720221118153201.0200426e20110701xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069024172DNAL7 a10.4161/nucl.2.4.162662doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNayak, Vinod10aComposition, recruitment and regulation of the PRC2 complex  ap. 277-282.  aThe PRC2 histone methyltransferase complex is an important regulator of gene expression programs in metazoans.

Isotherms of CO₂, CH₄, and N₂ on PCN-222 at low and high pressures were respectively measured. At 298 K, CO₂ uptakes at 100 and 3000 kPa were 1.16 and 13.67 mmol/g, respectively. At 298 K and 100 kPa, CO₂/CH₄ (50:50, v/v) and CO₂/N₂ (50:50, v/v) adsorption selectivities separately reached 4.3 and 73.7. At 298 K and 3000 kPa, CO₂/CH₄ (50:50, v/v) and CO₂/N₂ (50:50, v/v) adsorption selectivities were 4.7 and 32.8, respectively. Importantly, breakthrough experiments confirmed that PCN-222 could achieve the effective separation of CO₂/CH₄ (both 50:50 and 10:90) and CO₂/N₂ (both 50:50 and 15:85) gas mixtures. The dynamic regeneration experiments showed that PCN-222 maintained its initial CO₂ adsorption capacity after five cycles of CO₂ adsorption–desorption. This work suggested that PCN-222 was a potential candidate for selectively separating CO₂/N₂ and CO₂/CH₄.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3acarbon dioxide 3acoordination polymers 3amethane 3anitrogen 3aprocess design1 aShi, Renfeng1 aChen, Yongwei1 aChen, Yang1 aWu, Houxiao1 aZhou, Xin1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4317-73541 aXi, Hongxia1 aLi, Zhong1 aXia, Qibin1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8563-67150 tIndustrial & engineering chemistry process design and development.g2018 Aug. 23, v. 57, no. 36 p.12215-12224dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23342x1520-50457nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.iecr.8b025963Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03666naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100002400188245013000212300001800342506007600360520193200436592002802368506003702396650002702433650002002460650001902480650001302499650001902512650002002531650001202551650001402563650001202577650001202589650002302601650002602624650001502650650001502665650001702680650001402697650002102711650002902732650001702761650001602778700002002794700002402814700003402838700002202872773012802894856008103022852000903103655001203112IND60520455220221207135704.0160520e201606  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052045522DNAL7 a10.1007/s00216-016-9512-12doi7 aPMC49067912pmcid7 a270392012pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBoggs, Ashley S.

There is a burgeoning need to develop specific direct-detection methods capable of providing simultaneous measurement of biologically relevant concentrations of multiple classes of hormones (estrogens, androgens, progestogens, and corticosteroids). The objectives of this study were to develop a liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method for multi-class steroid hormone detection using biologically relevant concentrations, then test limits of detection (LOD) in a high-background matrix by spiking charcoal-stripped fetal bovine serum (FBS) extract. Accuracy was tested with National Institute of Standards and Technology Standard Reference Materials (SRMs) with certified concentrations of cortisol, testosterone, and progesterone. 11-Deoxycorticosterone, 11-deoxycortisol, 17-hydroxypregnenolone, 17-hydroxyprogesterone, adrenosterone, androstenedione, cortisol, corticosterone, dehydroepiandrosterone, dihydrotestosterone, estradiol, estriol, estrone, equilin, pregnenolone, progesterone, and testosterone were also measured using isotopic dilution. Dansyl chloride (DC) derivatization was investigated maintaining the same method to improve and expedite estrogen analysis. Biologically relevant LODs were determined for 15 hormones. DC derivatization improved estrogen response two- to eight-fold, and improved chromatographic separation. All measurements had an accuracy ≤14 % difference from certified values (not accounting for uncertainty) and relative standard deviation ≤14 %. This method chromatographically separated and quantified biologically relevant concentrations of four hormone classes using highly specific fragmentation patterns and measured certified values of hormones that were previously split into three separate chromatographic methods.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3a17-hydroxyprogesterone 3aandrostenedione 3acorticosterone 3acortisol 3aderivatization 3adetection limit 3aequilin 3aestradiol 3aestriol 3aestrone 3afetal bovine serum 3aliquid chromatography 3amonitoring 3aprasterone 3apregnenolone 3ascreening 3asteroid hormones 3atandem mass spectrometry 3atestosterone 3auncertainty1 aBowden, John A.1 aGalligan, Thomas M.1 aGuillette, Louis J., Jr.cJr.1 aKucklick, John R.0 tAnalytical and bioanalytical chemistry.g2016 June, v. 408, no. 15 p.4179-4190dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx1618-26427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00216-016-9512-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03714naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100007000148245010400218300001300322520218700335592002802522650001902550650001902569650000902588650002302597650001902620650002902639650001302668650002002681650001202701650000902713650001202722650000902734650001602743653001702759653001202776653001902788653001302807653001102820700001902831700002302850700002302873700002302896700002002919700001802939700002802957773011902985856008303104852000903187655001203196IND60598176220221116152724.0190412e201805  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059817622DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jveb.2018.02.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAṣṭe, Aḍlūru Rāju,1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1490-113910aPilot study evaluating the effect of feeding method on overall activity of neutered indoor pet cats  ap. 9-13.  aIndoor housing of cats is associated with a higher incidence of multiple diseases, including obesity. Increased exercise is often recommended as a method of creating or increasing the negative energy balance required for weight loss. Food-dispensing toys have been suggested as a method of increasing cat activity and providing environmental enrichment but have not been systematically evaluated in client-owned cats. To compare the effect of meal feeding from a bowl versus a food-dispensing toy on overall activity, 19 client-owned cats were enrolled in a 2-way, 2-period, and randomized repeated-measures mixed-effects crossover study. All cats were acclimated to wearing an accelerometer attached to a collar during week 1. Cats randomized to the bowl-first condition were acclimated to bowl feeding during week 2, and activity counts were collected during week 3. Cats randomized to the toy-first condition were acclimated to toy feeding during week 2, and activity counts were collected during week 3. During week 4, feeding methods were crossed. Cats randomized to the bowl-first condition were acclimated to toy feeding during week 4, and activity counts were collected during week 5. Cats randomized to the toy-first condition were acclimated to bowl feeding during week 4, and activity counts were collected during week 5. The outcome measure of interest was the change in total activity during weeks 3 and 5 for both groups. No significant difference was found in average weekly (P = 0.30) or daily activity counts (P = 0.17) when cats were fed from a toy compared with a bowl. A treatment effect by day was observed with activity decreasing in the toy-first group and increasing in the bowl-first group between days 3 and 4 (P = 0.028). In addition, we found that overall activity of cats decreased 6%-7% with each 1-year increase in age (P = 0.041). Although the type of feeding method in this pilot study did not affect overall activity, providing meals to cats using food toys may provide other benefits related to satiety, stress reduction, and overall well-being. More research is needed to explore the benefits of alternative feeding practices for indoor cats.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaccelerometers 3aanimal feeding 3acats 3across-over studies 3aenergy balance 3aenvironmental enrichment 3aexercise 3afeeding methods 3aobesity 3apets 3asatiety 3atoys 3aweight loss 0acat behavior 0aobesity 0afeeding method 0aactivity 0aindoor1 aWitzel, Angela1 aAlbright, Julia D.1 aSiegfried, Kaitlin1 aGruen, Margaret E.1 aThomson, Andrea1 aPrice, Joshua1 aLascelles, B.

As soon as the resins are secreted, molecular changes start altering their chemical, mechanical and optical properties. The ageing processes are complex, and the chemical and structural changes associated with resin degradation are not yet fully known. Many questions still remain open, for instance changes happening in pimaranes, one of the two diterpenoid constituents of the resin. A systematic study of the ageing process of Pinus resins is done through Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) using chemical standards and complementing the obtained results with gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (GC/MS) analysis when necessary. Moreover, long-term degradation processes are also investigated through the analysis of a selection of dated historical resins. This study overcomes the limitations of GC/MS and brings new information about the reactions and interactions between molecules during Pinus resin ageing processes. It also provides information about which bonds are affected and unaffected, and these can be used as specific markers of the degradation and of the resins themselves.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aPinus 3aditerpenoids 3agas chromatography-mass spectrometry 3aoptical properties 3aresins1 aSalvadó, Nati1 aButí, Salvador1 aPradell, Trinitat0 tAnalytical and bioanalytical chemistry.g2016 June, v. 408, no. 15 p.4073-4082dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl3870029x1618-26427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00216-016-9496-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02219naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100002100138245010700159300001400266506002800280520089900308592002801207506003701235650001901272650001701291650001401308650001201322650002201334650001301356650001501369651001001384653001201394653001501406653003201421653001401453700002001467700002201487773021801509856007301727852000901800655001201809IND60774815820221207065203.0150922e200912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077481582DNAL7 a10.12899/asr-8692doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMarca, Orazio la10aProve di avviamento ad altofusto in un ceduo di cerro (Quercus cerris L.) del Gargano: primi risultati  ap. 25-33.  aResource is Open Access  a<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Conversion trials in turkey oak (Quercus cerris L.) coppices of Gargano (Puglia, Italy): first results.</strong></span> Six plots have been drawn in an aged turkish oak coppice stand, 35 years after last clearcut.

The malt bagasse was characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and specific surface area (BET method).Batch biosorption experiments were conducted in order to determine the following parameters: particles size, pH, agitation speed, temperature, contact time, biomass dosage, influence of the ionic strength and, finally, the influence of other textile dye on the OS-TGL biosorption. The optimum conditions for OS-TGL removal were obtained at pH 1.5, agitation speed of 150rpm, contact time of 180min and biomass dosage 2, 8gL−1. The results show that the kinetics of biosorption followed a pseudo-second-order model and by increasing the temperature from 293 up to 313K, the biosorption capacity was improved. The Langmuir model showed better fit and the estimated biosorption capacity was 23.2mgg−1. The negative values of Gibbs free energy, ΔG°, and positive value of enthalpy, ΔH°, confirm the spontaneous nature and endothermic character of the biosorption process. The results of the ionic strength effect indicated that the biosorption process under study had a strong tolerance in high salt concentrations. The removal capacity (>95%) was not affected with the presence of other textile dyes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aGibbs free energy 3aagitation 3aaqueous solutions 3abagasse 3abiomass 3abiosorption 3adyes 3aendothermy 3aenthalpy 3afabrics 3aionic strength 3amalt 3amodels 3apH 3asorption isotherms 3asurface area 3atemperature 0aMalt bagasse 0aOrange TGL 182% 0aTextile dye 0aBiosorption1 aChaves, Eduardo S.1 aSanchez, Jefferson D.S.1 aWatanabe, Erica R.L.R.1 aPietrobelli, Juliana M.T.A.1 aLenzi, Giane G.0 tEcotoxicology and environmental safety.g2016 Feb., v. 124 p.329-336dElsevier Inc.x0147-65137nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoenv.2015.11.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02571naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001600143245008200159300001600241520147900257592002801736650002201764650002001786650002501806650001501831650002301846650002201869650002301891650001801914700001801932700001901950700002001969700001701989773011502006856007902121852000902200655001202209IND60515009320221116201730.0160310e20151201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051500932DNAL7 a10.1089/fpd.2015.20132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFord, Laura10aApproaches to the Surveillance of Foodborne Disease: A Review of the Evidence  ap. 927-936.  aFoodborne disease surveillance aims to reduce the burden of illness due to contaminated food. There are several different types of surveillance systems, including event-based surveillance, indicator-based surveillance, and integrated food chain surveillance. These approaches are not mutually exclusive, have overlapping data sources, require distinct capacities and resources, and can be considered a hierarchy, with each level being more complex and resulting in a greater ability to detect and control foodborne disease. Event-based surveillance is generally the least resource-intensive system and makes use of informal data sources. Indicator-based surveillance is seen as traditional notifiable disease surveillance and consists of routinely collected data. Integrated food chain surveillance is viewed as the optimal practice for conducting continuous risk analysis for foodborne diseases, but also requires significant ongoing resources and greater multisectoral collaboration compared to the other systems. Each country must determine the most appropriate structure for their surveillance system for foodborne diseases based on their available resources. This review explores the evidence on the principles, minimum capabilities, and minimum requirements of each type of surveillance and discusses examples from a range of countries. This review forms the evidence base for the Strengthening the Surveillance and Response for Foodborne Diseases: A Practical Manual.  aPublisher supplied data 3aburden of disease 3adata collection 3adisease surveillance 3afood chain 3afood contamination 3afoodborne illness 3anotifiable disease 3arisk analysis1 aMiller, Megge1 aCawthorne, Amy1 aFearnley, Emily1 aKirk, Martyn0 tFoodborne pathogens & disease.g2015 Dec. 01, v. 12, no. 12 p.927-936dMary Ann Liebert, Inc.x1556-71257nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1089%2Ffpd.2015.20133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04145naa a2200769 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094024002200125024001900147040001800166100002600184245013300210300001800343506007600361520176200437592002802199506003702227650002602264650003102290650002302321650001202344650001502356650001702371650001902388650001602407650003002423650001802453650004802471650001802519650001102537650002802548650002002576650001702596650003002613650001602643650002202659650001602681650001702697650002102714650002102735650001302756650002202769650003102791650001702822650002702839650001602866653001402882653002202896653001502918653002002933653001802953700001702971700002502988700001903013700002203032700002303054700001903077700002603096700002003122773012203142856007703264961001303341852000903354655001203363IND60620258320221207105814.0181107e20160711xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062025832DNAL7 a10.3945/an.116.0125832doi7 aPMC49428752pmcid7 a274225122pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBlumberg, Jeffrey B.,10aImpact of Cranberries on Gut Microbiota and Cardiometabolic Health: Proceedings of the Cranberry Health Research Conference 2015  ap. 759S-770S.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aRecent advances in cranberry research have expanded the evidence for the role of this Vaccinium berry fruit in modulating gut microbiota function and cardiometabolic risk factors. The A-type structure of cranberry proanthocyanidins seems to be responsible for much of this fruit's efficacy as a natural antimicrobial. Cranberry proanthocyanidins interfere with colonization of the gut by extraintestinal pathogenic Escherichia coli in vitro and attenuate gut barrier dysfunction caused by dietary insults in vivo. Furthermore, new studies indicate synergy between these proanthocyanidins, other cranberry components such as isoprenoids and xyloglucans, and gut microbiota. Together, cranberry constituents and their bioactive catabolites have been found to contribute to mechanisms affecting bacterial adhesion, coaggregation, and biofilm formation that may underlie potential clinical benefits on gastrointestinal and urinary tract infections, as well as on systemic anti-inflammatory actions mediated via the gut microbiome. A limited but growing body of evidence from randomized clinical trials reveals favorable effects of cranberry consumption on measures of cardiometabolic health, including serum lipid profiles, blood pressure, endothelial function, glucoregulation, and a variety of biomarkers of inflammation and oxidative stress. These results warrant further research, particularly studies dedicated to the elucidation of dose-response relations, pharmacokinetic/metabolomics profiles, and relevant biomarkers of action with the use of fully characterized cranberry products. Freeze-dried whole cranberry powder and a matched placebo were recently made available to investigators to facilitate such work, including interlaboratory comparability.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aVaccinium macrocarpon 3aanti-inflammatory activity 3abacterial adhesion 3abiofilm 3abiomarkers 3ablood lipids 3ablood pressure 3acranberries 3adigestive system diseases 3adose response 3aextraintestinal pathogenic Escherichia coli 3afreeze drying 3afruits 3agastrointestinal system 3aglucoregulation 3ainflammation 3aintestinal microorganisms 3aisoprenoids 3alipid composition 3ametabolites 3ametabolomics 3aoxidative stress 3apharmacokinetics 3aplacebos 3aproanthocyanidins 3arandomized clinical trials 3arisk factors 3aurinary tract diseases 3axyloglucans 0acranberry 0aproanthocyanidins 0amicrobiome 0acardiometabolic 0aantimicrobial1 aBasu, Arpita1 aKrueger, Christian G1 aLila, Mary Ann1 aNeto, Catherine C1 aNovotny, Janet A.,1 aReed, Jess D.,1 aRodriguez-Mateos, Ana1 aToner, Cheryl D0 tAdvances in nutrition.g2016 July 11, v. 7, no. 4 p.759S-770SdOxford University PresswJournal:2280x2156-53767nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3945/an.116.0125833Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/ARS  aDNAL 7aarticle02971naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002100151245012700172300001600299520133100315536010401646592002801750650001401778650001301792650001701805650001601822650001701838650001501855650002701870650001701897650000901914650002101923650001601944650001701960650001301977650001401990650001002004650001302014650001502027650001502042650001202057650001202069653001602081653002602097653002402123653001302147653001202160700001702172773014602189856008502335852000902420655001202429IND60711300720221116155006.0200921e20200402xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071130072DNAL7 a10.1080/00288330.2019.16612592doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMeakin, Craig A.10aEvaluation of food competition and resource partitioning of recruiting fish with permanent residents in a seagrass habitat  ap. 149-166.  aRecruiting King George whiting Sillaginodes punctatus were studied to assess the potential for food competition with permanent resident fish species in a nursery habitat. Marine migrant post larval S. punctatus (<60 mm TL) consumed primarily harpacticoid copepods and had high (>0.6) diet overlap with permanent resident fish species Favonigobius leteralis and Stigmatopora nigra. Food electivity index indicated that S. punctatus juveniles preferred harpacticoid copepods and amphipods, while juvenile Heteroclinus adelaide and Gymnapistes marmoratus migrating to the nursery habitat targeted larger prey such as amphipods. Preference for larger prey by H. adelaide and G. marmoratus species coupled with differences in prey composition in the stomach was due to mouth size and feeding habits, resulting in different food preferences to S. punctatus. The whiting showed an ontogenetic shift in diet with early settlers (>60 mm TL) consuming less copepods and more amphipods, while previous year recruits (>120 mm TL) consumed polychaete worms. This study indicates that competition for food resources between the new recruiting S. punctatus juveniles and permanent resident juveniles is reduced through differences in temporal and spatial feeding behaviours, mouth morphology, and ontogenetic shift in prey consumption.  aThis study was part of a PhD project funded by Flinders University and the Playford Memorial Trust.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAmphipoda 3aCopepoda 3aFavonigobius 3aGymnapistes 3aHeteroclinus 3aPolychaeta 3aSillaginodes punctatus 3aStigmatopora 3adiet 3afeeding behavior 3afish larvae 3afood choices 3ahabitats 3ajuveniles 3amouth 3aontogeny 3apostlarvae 3aseagrasses 3astomach 3awhiting 0aCompetition 0aresource partitioning 0aKing George whiting 0aseagrass 0aestuary1 aQin, Jian G.0 tNew Zealand journal of marine and freshwater research.g2020 Apr. 2, v. 54, no. 2 p.149-166dTaylor & FranciswJournal:12297x1175-88057nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00288330.2019.16612593Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02246naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001600148245009400164300001600258520128400274592002801558653002301586653003701609653001701646653002901663700001801692700001601710700001301726700001401739773008801753856008201841852000901923655001201932IND60528062520221119072843.0160721e201603  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052806252DNAL7 a10.1016/j.pisc.2015.11.0272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXiong, Jian10aExperimental study on the physical and chemical properties of the deep hard brittle shale  ap. 166-170.  aIn the hard brittle shale formation, rock composition, physical and chemical properties, mechanics property before and after interacting with fluid have direct relation with borehole problems, such as borehole wall collapse, mud loss, hole shrinkage. To achieve hard brittle shale micro-structure, physical–chemical properties and mechanics property, energy-dispersive X-ray diffraction (XRD), cation exchange capacity experiment and hardness test are conducted. The result of laboratory experiments indicates that, clay mineral and quartz is dominated in mineral composition. In clay mineral, illite and illite/semectite mixed layers are abundant and there is no sign of montmorillonite. Value of cation exchange capacity (CEC) ranges from 102.5–330mmol/kg and average value is 199.56mmol/kg. High value of CEC and content of clay mineral means hard brittle shale has strong ability of hydration. The image of XRD shows well developed micro-cracks and pores, which make rock failure easily, especially when fluid invades rock inside. Shale sample soaked with anti-high temperature KCL drilling fluid on shorter immersing time has stronger strength, whereas shale sample soaked with plugging and film forming KCL drilling fluid on longer immersing time has stronger strength.  aPublisher supplied data 0aHard brittle shale 0aPhysical and chemical properties 0aClay mineral 0aCation exchange capacity1 aLiu, Xiangjun1 aLiang, Lixi1 aDing, Yi1 aLei, Meng0 tPerspectives in Science.g2016 Mar., v. 7 p.166-170dElsevier GmbHx2213-02097nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.pisc.2015.11.0273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01389naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002000153245010700173300001400280506002800294520011400322592002800436506003700464650003200501650001100533650001700544653001500561653004000576653005400616653005400670700002100724700001700745773018000762856008800942852000901030655001201039IND60774816020221207100109.0180806e201412  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077481602DNAL7 a10.22363/2312-979X-2014-4-67-792doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPlyushikov, V G14aThe research activities in Agrarian faculty of the Russian Peoples' Friendship University of 2011-2013  ap. 67-79.  aResource is Open Access  aThe analysis of the Russian Peoples' Friendship University Agrarian faculty research activities of 2011-2013.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3ainterpersonal relationships 3apeople 3auniversities 0aнаука 0aаграрный факультет 0aэффективность аспирантуры 0aпубликационная активность1 aRomanova, E.

Approximately 50% of Americans consume less than the EAR for magnesium, and some age groups consume substantially less. A growing body of literature from animal, epidemiologic, and clinical studies has demonstrated a varied pathologic role for magnesium deficiency that includes electrolyte, neurologic, musculoskeletal, and inflammatory disorders; osteoporosis; hypertension; cardiovascular diseases; metabolic syndrome; and diabetes. Studies have also demonstrated that magnesium deficiency is associated with several chronic diseases and that a reduced risk of these diseases is observed with higher magnesium intake or supplementation. Subclinical magnesium deficiency can exist despite the presentation of a normal status as defined within the current serum magnesium reference interval of 0.75–0.95 mmol/L. This reference interval was derived from data from NHANES I (1974), which was based on the distribution of serum magnesium in a normal population rather than clinical outcomes. What is needed is an evidenced-based serum magnesium reference interval that reflects optimal health and the current food environment and population. We present herein data from an array of scientific studies to support the perspective that subclinical deficiencies in magnesium exist, that they contribute to several chronic diseases, and that adopting a revised serum magnesium reference interval would improve clinical care and public health.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aAmericans 3aDietary Guidelines 3aEstimated Average Requirement 3aNational Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 3ablood serum 3achronic diseases 3aclinical trials 3adiabetes 3aelectrolytes 3ahypertension 3amagnesium 3ametabolic syndrome 3amusculoskeletal system 3anutrient deficiencies 3aosteoporosis 3apublic health 3arisk reduction 0aserum magnesium 0aplasma magnesium 0amagnesium deficiency 0areference interval 0achronic disease1 aElin, Ronald J1 aRosanoff, Andrea1 aWallace, Taylor C.,1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9403-27451 aGuerrero-Romero, Fernando1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9636-98701 aHruby, Adela1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6549-46251 aLutsey, Pamela L1 aNielsen, Forrest H1 aRodriguez-Moran, Martha1 aSong, Yiqing1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3642-67781 aVan Horn, Linda V1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1362-58060 tAdvances in nutrition.g2016 Nov. 10, v. 7, no. 6 p.977-993dOxford University PresswJournal:2280x2156-53767nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3945/an.116.0127653Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/ARS  aDNAL 7aarticle03310naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002000143245009800163300001600261520205800277592002802335653003002363653002302393653001902416653002302435653002402458700001802482700002402500700002002524700002902544700002802573700002202601700002502623700002402648700002502672773014002697856007802837852000902915655001202924IND60661780220221117234222.0191104e20191101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066178022DNAL7 a10.1089/vbz.2019.24422doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRemesar, Susana10aLongitudinal Study of Infection with Borrelia spp. in Questing Ticks from North-Western Spain  ap. 785-792.  aIntroduction: Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato (s.l.), the causative agent of Lyme borreliosis, is the most prevalent tick-borne pathogen in Europe, where it is mainly transmitted by Ixodes ricinus. This tick also circulates Borrelia miyamotoi, a member of the relapsing fever group of species. Objectives: A longitudinal study was performed to assess the prevalence of Borrelia spp. in questing ticks. Relationships between Borrelia prevalence in ticks and some variables such as tick development stage, sampling area, and questing tick density were assessed; in addition, the distribution of B. burgdorferi s.l. was analyzed to establish the periods of acarological risk. Methods: Ticks were collected monthly by flagging in three different ecological areas (coast, plateau, and mountain) in north-western Spain during a 2-year study. Borrelia DNA was detected by PCR, targeting the flagellin (fla) gene. Positive samples were also characterized at the rrfA-rrlB intergenic spacer region and the glycerophosphodiester phosphodiesterase (GlpQ) gene. Results: B. burgdorferi s.l. DNA was detected in 11.84% of I. ricinus. Five Lyme Borrelia species were identified (Borrelia afzelii, B. burgdorferi sensu stricto, Borrelia garinii, Borrelia lusitaniae, and Borrelia valaisiana). One single relapsing fever species (B. miyamotoi) was detected (0.85%). Questing Ixodes frontalis, Ixodes acuminatus, Dermacentor reticulatus, and Dermacentor marginatus yield negative results. The prevalence of B. burgdorferi s.l. was significantly higher in female ticks and in the mountain area. In addition, a seasonal pattern in the B. burgdorferi s.l. prevalence distribution throughout the study was not detected. Conclusions: The detection of a noticeable prevalence of B. burgdorferi s.l. in questing I. ricinus suggests a high acarological risk, especially in mountain area. There is no evidence of a relationship between the prevalence of B. burgdorferi s.l. and the density of questing ticks, nor traces of a seasonal pattern in the values of prevalence in ticks.  aPublisher supplied data 0aBorrelia burgdorferi s.l. 0aBorrelia miyamotoi 0aIxodes ricinus 0alongitudinal study 0anorth-western Spain1 aDíaz, Pablo,1 aVenzal, Jose Manuel1 aPrieto, Alberto1 aEstrada-Peña, Agustín,1 aLópez, Ceferino Manuel1 aPanadero, Rosario1 aFernández, Gonzalo,1 aDíez-Baños, Pablo1 aMorrondo, Patrocinio0 tVector borne and zoonotic diseases.g2019 Nov. 01, v. 19, no. 11 p.785-792dMary Ann Liebert, Inc.wJournal:J000000160x1557-77597nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1089/vbz.2019.24423Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03101naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001500148245014200163300001400305520190500319592002802224650001402252650000902266650001102275650001302286650000902299650002602308653001102334653002202345653001702367653001602384653001202400653001202412700002402424700002102448700002102469773012102490856008302611852000902694655001202703IND60598176520221116152818.0210708e201807  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059817652DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jveb.2018.05.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDyson, Sue10aBehavioral observations and comparisons of nonlame horses and lame horses before and after resolution of lameness by diagnostic analgesia  ap. 64-70.  aDifferentiation between alteration in behavior which is the result of pain and that reflecting other behavior is potentially challenging in ridden horses. A ridden horse ethogram has been developed, tested, and combined with a pain score. Nonlame horses generally had lower pain scores than lame horses, although there was a small overlap. To determine if the ethogram could be used to differentiate lame horses before and after diagnostic analgesia had substantially improved lameness, and to verify its use in comparison of nonlame and lame horses, a retrospective study was done. Video recordings of 10 lame horses were reviewed by a trained assessor before and after diagnostic analgesia resolved the baseline lameness and improved any gait abnormalities seen in canter. The ridden horse ethogram was applied to each horse under each circumstance that it was ridden. Occurrence (yes/no) for each of 24 behaviors was recorded. Data were combined with that of an additional 13 nonlame horses and 24 lame horses. After abolition of lameness, the total sum score of behaviors (P < 0.01), sum of facial (P < 0.05), sum of body (P < 0.05), and sum of gait (P < 0.05) scores were all significantly reduced. Fifteen behavioral markers occurred significantly more often in lame horses (P values 0.00–0.05), and an additional 4 markers were only seen in lame horses. For pooled data, all sum markers were significantly higher in lame horses compared with nonlame horses or after resolution of lameness (P < 0.05). The length of the video recordings was not standardized among horses, nor before and after diagnostic analgesia. It was not possible to hide the presence of lameness which could have biased the assessor. Application of the ridden horse ethogram was able to differentiate between lame horses before and after diagnostic analgesia and nonlame and lame horses, although there was some overlap.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanalgesia 3agait 3ahorses 3alameness 3apain 3aretrospective studies 0aequine 0aconflict behavior 0apain grading 0aheadshaking 0abucking 0arearing1 aBerger, Jeannine M.1 aEllis, Andrea D.1 aMullard, Jessica0 tJournal of veterinary behavior.g2018 July,  Aug., v. 26 p.64-70dElsevier Inc.wJournal:J000000117x1558-78787nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jveb.2018.05.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02892naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100001800138245010400156300001600260506002800276520145900304592002801763506003701791650002601828650001201854650001801866650001501884650001301899651001001912653002301922653002101945653002001966653004001986653002602026700002202052700002102074700002002095700001902115700002202134773022002156856007302376852000902449655001202458IND60774816120221207104534.0150922e200912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077481612DNAL7 a10.12899/asr-8792doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDucci, Fulvio10aDelimitazione di Regioni di Provenienza per la gestione dei Materiali Forestali di Base in Campania  ap. 133-142.  aResource is Open Access  a<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Delimitation of Provenance Regions for the management of Forest Reproductive Materials in Campania.</span></strong>The 1999/105/CE Directive has set Provenance Regions as the standard European management approach of forest propagation materials (mainly for “Source Identified” and “Selected Materials”) . The Authors report about a method for establishing Provenance Regions for forest species in Mediterranean environments (partitive-ecologic approach). The method consists of an iterative two steps procedure: a scheme of Provenance Regions is first worked out on the grounds of environmental factors and technical qualifications, and then validated by statistical analysis (Discriminant Analysis) performed on bio-climatic and geo-lithologic data. The method, applied to region Campania, led to the definition of six Provenance Regions. The initially considered regions of the interior and higher elevation areas under more “oceanic” conditions, R5 and R6 appeared really homogeneous and were merged to form two sub-regions. The same method was applied to merge regions R1 and R2 in sub-regions. Anyway, because of the supposed higher differentiation among fractionated ranges of many southern species, these Provenance Regions should be kept distinct in order local Forest Genetic Resources will be preserved.</p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><br /></strong></span>  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3adiscriminant analysis 3aforests 3afractionation 3aprovenance 3aresearch 3aItaly 0aProvenance Regions 0apartitive method 0abasic materials 0areproductive materials, seed stands 0aforest nursery system1 aVannuccini, Mario1 aCarone, Giovanni1 aVedele, Stefano1 aCilli, Stefano1 aApuzzo, Salvatore0 tAnnals of Silvicultural Research.g2009 Dec., v. 35, no. 0 p.133-142dConsiglio per la ricerca in agricoltura e l'analisi dell'economia agraria - Research Centre for Forestry and WoodwJournal:21325x2284-354X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.12899/asr-8793Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02093naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001600144245003500160300001600195520123400211592002801445650001301473650001501486650001901501650002101520650001401541700002301555700002701578773009901605856007801704852000901782655001201791IND60690242520221118153848.0200426e20110701xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069024252DNAL7 a10.4161/nucl.2.4.168062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aThiry, Marc14aThe nucleolus: When 2 became 3  ap. 289-293.  aThough the nucleolus is considered today as a multifunctional domain, its primary function is ribosome biogenesis. We have shown at the ultrastructural level that there are primarily two types of nucleolar organization: nucleoli containing three components in amniotes and two components in all other eukaryotes. In a recent report we made the additional, and surprising, finding that both types of nucleolar arrangement are found among living reptiles, viz. a bicompartmentalized nucleolus in turtles and a tricompartmentalized nucleolus in lizards, crocodiles and snakes. This latter organization occurs regardless of the species, the tissue or the developmental stages analyzed. These results are compatible with the view that the transition between bipartite and tripartite nucleoli coincided with the emergence of the amniotes within the Reptilia. They also support the previous hypothesis that turtles are primitive reptiles. The emergence in amniote vertebrates of a third nucleolar compartment might have imparted novel regulatory functions to the nucleolus, as well as perhaps, expanding the adaptability of ribosome synthesis to an ever changing environment, thus, enhancing the overall fitness of amniotic vertebrates.  aPublisher supplied data 3aReptilia 3abiogenesis 3acell nucleolus 3aeukaryotic cells 3aribosomes1 aLamaye, Françoise1 aLafontaine, Denis L.J.0 tNucleus.g2011 July 1, v. 2, no. 4 p.289-293dTaylor & FranciswJournal:27386x1949-10427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.4161/nucl.2.4.168063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02981naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001400150245011100164300001200275520145400287592002801741650001601769650001801785650001101803650001501814650001101829650001001840650001001850650002201860650002501882650000901907650002201916650001001938650002601948651001001974653001501984653002001999653001402019653001402033653001002047653001202057700001602069700001602085700001602101700001302117700001302130700001702143700001902160700001702179700001402196773011102210856008502321852000902406655001202415IND60598176720221116152702.0190412e201801  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059817672DNAL7 a10.1016/j.meegid.2017.10.0252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHan, Rong10aMolecular prevalence of spotted fever group rickettsiae in ticks from Qinghai Province, northwestern China  ap. 1-7.  aTick-borne rickettsioses is one of the oldest known vector-borne diseases and has been viewed as emerging or re-emerging disease in China. The causative agents have been increasingly recognized and exhibited a high degree of genetic diversity and widespread distribution. This study was conducted to determine the prevalence of spotted fever group rickettsiae in ticks from Qinghai Province, northwestern China. In total, 860 questing adult ticks representing six species were collected. The SFG rickettsiae were detected in Haemaphysalis qinghaiensis (19.6%, 79/404), Dermacentor abaensis (73.7%, 157/213), Dermacentor silvarum (50.0%, 47/94), Dermacentor nuttalli (67.4%, 97/144), and Ixodes crenulatus (100%, 3/3), with an overall infection rate of 44.5%. The infection rates of SFG rickettsiae were significantly higher in Dermacentor spp. than in Haemaphysalis spp. (p<0.05). Sequence analyses of the gltA and ompA genes revealed that five SFG rickettsiae are present in ticks in Qinghai, including R. sibirica subspecies sibirica, R. raoultii, “Candidatus Rickettsia tibetani”, and “Candidatus Rickettsia gannanii” Y27 and F107. Moreover, a potential novel Rickettsia species (Rickettsia sp. 10CYF) was identified in D. nuttalli and I. crenulatus. These findings extend our knowledge of the potential vector spectrum and distribution of rickettsiae, and provided valuable information for assessing the potential risk for public health.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDermacentor 3aHaemaphysalis 3aIxodes 3aRickettsia 3aadults 3afever 3agenes 3agenetic variation 3arickettsial diseases 3arisk 3asequence analysis 3aticks 3avector-borne diseases 3aChina 0aRickettsia 0aSFG rickettsiae 0agltA gene 0aompA gene 0aTicks 0aQinghai1 aYang, Jifei1 aNiu, Qingli1 aLiu, Zhijie1 aChen, Ze1 aKan, Wei1 aHu, Guangwei1 aLiu, Guangyuan1 aLuo, Jianxun1 aYin, Hong0 tInfection, genetics, and evolution.g2018 Jan., v. 57 p.1-7dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12450x1567-13487nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.meegid.2017.10.0253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02977naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002000152245011000172520157400282592002801856650004401884650003001928650001501958650001501973650000801988650001801996650002202014650000902036650001502045650001902060650001202079650001102091650002002102650001002122650001302132653002902145653002402174653002102198653002502219700001402244700001902258700001702277773011702294856008702411852000902498655001202507IND60743738120221120080437.0211009e20210915xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074373812DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enconman.2021.1144572doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Linsheng10aSilane functionalization on zeolite 13X surface for direct steam generation in a solid sorption heat pump  aHigh-temperature steam has been directly generated from hot water based on a solid sorption heat pump system by employing silane functionalized zeolite 13X (XS). The adsorbent is prepared by a liquid phase grafting method to modify functional groups on the zeolite surface with a silane coupling agent. The static water contact angle (WCA) and surface functional groups are analyzed by optical contact angle measuring instruments and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), respectively. Analytical results confirm the successful preparation of surface hydrophobic zeolite. The water adsorption capacity of XS is slightly less than that of 13X, while the overall adsorption heat remains almost constant. Dry air at 130 °C is utilized for the regeneration of the wet zeolite in cyclic experiments. Steam at 207 °C is generated from input hot water at 72 °C in a packed bed filled with XS-25 (zeolite 13X functionalized by a saline solution concentration of 25%). The thermal response during the steam generation process is accelerated by utilizing XS. The mass of steam product does not change during the generation with XS, whereas cyclic time is shortened. Moreover, XS facilitates the regeneration process by decreasing the heat demand for the removal of free water. System evaluation results show that a higher Sₚ (steam productivity) is obtained for XS than that for zeolite 13X. COPₕ (coefficient of performance for heating) and SHP (specific heating power) are elevated by 23.6% and 5.7% for XS compared with those for zeolite 13X, respectively.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aadministrative management 3aadsorbents 3aadsorption 3aair 3acontact angle 3aenergy conversion 3aheat 3aheat pumps 3ahydrophobicity 3aliquids 3asilane 3asodium chloride 3asteam 3azeolites 0aSilane functionalization 0aHydrophobic zeolite 0aSteam generation 0aAdsorption heat pump1 aXue, Bing1 aChen, Tingting1 aLi, Guangyao0 tEnergy conversion and management.g2021 Sept. 15, v. 244 p.114457-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11831x0196-89047nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enconman.2021.1144573Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03021naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002200151245009500173300001600268520110500284536019901389592002801588650001801616650002101634650002201655650002301677650002601700650001501726650001501741650001801756650002001774650002001794650001101814650001301825650001601838650001501854650002101869650001801890651001601908653001701924653001501941653002001956653002501976653001702001653001202018653001102030653001902041653001602060700002102076700001902097700002602116700001802142700001902160773014602179856008502325852000902410655001202419IND60711301120221116155406.0200921e20200402xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071130112DNAL7 a10.1080/00288330.2019.17001362doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aValois, Amanda E.10aCommunity volunteer assessment of recreational water quality in the Hutt River, Wellington  ap. 200-217.  aWater is an important component of many recreational opportunities and New Zealand invests significant resources in recreational water quality (RWQ) monitoring to assess risks to public health. However, monitoring primarily focuses on microbiological hazards and RWQ is considerably broader than this. The goal of this study was to take a comprehensive approach to evaluating RWQ while exploring the potential for greater public involvement in monitoring. A popular river swimming site was co-monitored weekly by volunteers and a council field officer. The attributes monitored–water temperature, visual clarity, benthic cyanobacteria and filamentous periphyton cover, E. coli and rubbish–were identified from a volunteer workshop. There was good concordance between volunteer and council data suggesting that volunteer measurements can be considered reliable. This highlights the potential for volunteers, with professional support, including training and quality assurance, to extend council RWQ surveillance to additional monitoring sites while improving public engagement on water management.  aThis research was made possible by MBIE Strategic Science Investment Funding through NIWA’s Freshwater and Estuaries Centre (Project FWWQ1818), with GWRC meeting the costs of their monitoring.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCyanobacteria 3aEscherichia coli 3abenthic organisms 3abiological hazards 3acitizen participation 3amonitoring 3aperiphyton 3apublic health 3aquality control 3arisk assessment 3arivers 3aswimming 3atemperature 3avolunteers 3awater management 3awater quality 3aNew Zealand 0aSwimmability 0arecreation 0acitizen science 0acommunity monitoring 0ahuman health 0aE. coli 0alitter 0avisual clarity 0atoxic algae1 aMilne, Juliet R.1 aHeath, Mark W.1 aDavies-Colley, R.

The replacement of the original glass chimney is performed by shielding a nitrogen co-flow enabled measurement at a wavelength of 3.9μm. This modification, together with a special arrangement of the measuring system (spectral filtering, data acquisition and post-processing), permitted the observation of various types of hydrodynamic instabilities, including transition states. The advantages of our arrangement are demonstrated with an ethylene non-premixed flame with high sooting tendency. Two known modes of hydrodynamic instability (varicose and sinuous) that occur in buoyant flames were studied and described quantitatively. Based on the intensity of the infrared emissions, we identified and qualitatively described the modes of periodic hydrodynamic instability that are accompanied by flame tip opening, which has not been observed for this type of flame.  aPublisher supplied data 0aHydrodynamic instability 0aSooting flame 0aCup-burner apparatus 0aInfrared imaging1 aNevrlý, Václav1 aStřižík, Michal1 aGrigorová, Eva1 aZelinger, Zdeněk1 aKubát, Pavel1 aKudrna, Pavel1 aPira, Peter1 aWild, Jan0 tPerspectives in Science.g2016 Mar., v. 7 p.184-189dElsevier GmbHx2213-02097nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.pisc.2015.11.0303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01334naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002200153245010700175300001400282506002800296520032600324592002800650506003700678650001600715650001700731650001700748700002200765773016000787856008800947852000901035655001201044IND60774816620221207100115.0170815e200612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077481662DNAL7 a10.21498/2518-1017.4.2006.680292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aУліч, Л.

As Zaca-DRB gene sequences are involved with antigen presentation of bacteria and other extracellular pathogens, we predicted that they would play a role in determining responses to these pathogenic spirochaetes. Specifically, we investigated whether Zaca-DRB diversity (number of genes) and configuration (presence of specific genes) explained differences in disease severity, and whether higher levels of Zaca-DRB diversity predicted the number of specific Leptospira interrogans serovars that a sea lion's serum would react against. We found that serum from diseased sea lions with more Zaca-DRB loci reacted against a wider array of serovars. Specific Zaca-DRB loci were linked to reactions with particular serovars. Interestingly, sea lions with clinical manifestation of leptospirosis that had higher numbers of Zaca-DRB loci were less likely to recover from disease than those with lower diversity, and those that harboured Zaca-DRB.C or –G were 4.5 to 5.3 times more likely to die from leptospirosis, regardless of the infective serovars. We propose that for leptospirosis, a disadvantage of having a wider range of antigen presentation might be increased disease severity due to immunopathology. Ours is the first study to examine the importance of Zaca-DRB diversity for antigen detection and disease severity following natural exposure to infective leptospires.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLeptospira interrogans 3aZalophus californianus 3aantigen detection 3aantigen presentation 3aantigens 3abacteria 3ablood serum 3adisease severity 3aimmunopathology 3aleptospirosis 3aloci 3amajor histocompatibility complex 3anucleotide sequences 3apathogens 3aserotypes 0aAntibodies 0aCalifornia sea lion 0aDRB polymorphism 0aMajor histocompatibility complex 0aMAT 0aLeptospira interrogans 0aLeptospirosis1 aGulland, Frances M.D.1 aBowen, Lizabeth0 tInfection, genetics, and evolution.g2018 Jan., v. 57 p.158-165dElsevier B.V.aElsevier B.V.wJournal:12450x1567-13487nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.meegid.2017.11.0233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03280naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100006300152245007500215520177200290592002802062650003002090650002202120650001202142650001502154650001702169650002202186650000902208650001302217650001702230650002102247650002702268650001802295653001602313653003102329653003402360653002102394700002202415700001502437700001802452700002902470700002702499700001802526700002702544773013102571856008702702852000902789655001202798IND60743738320221120084634.0211009e20210915xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074373832DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enconman.2021.1144602doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChiong, Meng-Choung1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1815-388710aAdvancements of combustion technologies in the ammonia-fuelled engines  aThe worldwide decarbonisation movement has turned ammonia into one of the attractive alternative fuel for power generation. This paper reviews the progress of ammonia combustion technologies in spark ignition engine, compression ignition engine, and gas turbine. Relevant publications from prominent academic journals were acquired from credible scholarly databases and analysed. Ammonia dissociation and separate hydrogen supply were typically employed to deliver hydrogen to enhance ammonia reaction in the spark ignition engine. To achieve satisfactory engine performances with thermal efficiency of around 30%, a hydrogen mass fraction of roughly 10% is required for the ammonia/hydrogen engine. Engine parameters optimisation may be needed to increase hydrogen mass fraction further. Aqueous ammonia elevates heat release rate of full load compression ignition engine by almost 10%. However, prolonged ignition delay could potentially lead to higher engine noise levels. Multiple fuel injection optimisation is seemingly a more promising solution for improving ammonia compression ignition engine performances. In recent years, partial premixed combustion has gained considerable interest in hydrogen/ammonia gas turbine combustion research. This is mainly due to its ability to operate at equivalence ratio as low as 0.4, and in the slight fuel-rich regime. For operation at equivalence ratio 1.05, the nitric oxide concentration was decreased by a factor of approximately 5.9 when compared with that of stoichiometric condition. In all, ammonia offers a practical opportunity for sustainable power generation via internal combustion engines and gas turbine. Ground-breaking combustion technologies are crucial to boost the adoption of ammonia in these engines.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadministrative management 3aalternative fuels 3aammonia 3acombustion 3adissociation 3aenergy conversion 3aheat 3ahydrogen 3anitric oxide 3apower generation 3aspark ignition engines 3astoichiometry 0aGas turbine 0aInternal combustion engine 0aPartially premixed combustion 0aRenewable energy1 aChong, Cheng Tung1 aNg, Jo-Han1 aMashruk, Syed1 aChong, William Woei Fong1 aSamiran, Nor Afzanizam1 aMong, Guo Ren1 aValera-Medina, Agustin0 tEnergy conversion and management.g2021 Sept. 15, v. 244 p.114460-dElsevier LtdaElsevier LtdwJournal:11831x0196-89047nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enconman.2021.1144603Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01280naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002000148245010700168300001600275520040300291592002800694653001200722653002300734653001700757653002600774700002300800773008800823856008200911852000900993655001201002IND60528063020221119072756.0160721e201603  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052806302DNAL7 a10.1016/j.pisc.2015.11.0322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBrozovsky, Jiri10aEstimation of initial elastic properties of 2D homogenised masonry model based on tensor scale indices  ap. 195-199.  aThe paper discussed numerical approach for an estimation of initial elastic material properties for homogenised models of masonry.

Catalytic hydrodearomatization (HDA) improves the qualities and properties of distillates for health, food, and pharmaceutical applications. In this research, the aromatic content of the four different middle distillate fractions varies from 10 to 12% volume. The goal is to saturate the aromatics to <0.1% volume at pressures, temperatures, and space velocities that are optimized for the lowest operating cost and longest catalyst life. Additionally, this study aims to determine if HDA is more favorable for processing the individual distillate cuts or the comingled products. This study also utilizes a modified high-performance liquid chromatography refractive index (HPLC-RI) method in which an ultraviolet (UV) detector is used to measure low levels of aromatics. A combination of UV and HPLC techniques was able to quantify aromatic levels as low as 0.03% v/v and 0.01% v/v, respectively.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaromatic compounds 3acatalysts 3adistillates 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3ahydrogenation 3aoperating costs 3apetroleum 3aprocess design 3arefractive index 3atemperature1 aKozminski, Michael,1 aWard, Joshua1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3264-943X1 aJohnson, Matthew1 aGuevremont, Jeffrey M.0 tIndustrial & engineering chemistry process design and development.g2018 Aug. 17, v. 57, no. 36 p.12029-12035dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23342x1520-50457nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.iecr.8b029093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02539naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002200150245006500172300001600237520130800253592002801561653002501589653002001614653002601634653002801660653001501688653001801703653002701721653002501748653003101773653001901804653001601823653001901839653001901858773019501877856008402072852000902156655001202165IND60591636920221118012414.0180321e201703  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059163692DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bmhime.2017.11.0212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSala, Juan Emilio14aThe jibarization of logos: how medical reductionism can kill  ap. 154-163.  aIn recent decades, a disciplinary and sub disciplinary proliferation has been triggered both in the medical fields and science in general. This trend may be partially explained by two diachronic, dialectically interconnected facts: the deepening of the technical, social and international division of labor in the globalized capitalist world, and the triumph of the reductionist program, mainly developed by the logical empiricism of the Vienna Circle. This paper aims to deepen the debate on the intricate links between medicine, biology, philosophy, reductionism, and complex thought, by using two examples: a current clinical case report and the situation experienced by a famous American scientist, Stephen Jay Gould, about his first cancer, an abdominal mesothelioma. We have witnessed how the two above-mentioned historical facts have been operating as a super-structure like a pair of “tweezers”, dismembering and compressing at the same moment the object of knowledge, the theories that allow their study, and the subject that receives the knowledge. This jibarization of knowledge is a real problem for public health, from the moment that it impacts, omnipresent, in the actual hegemonic medical model, leading to potentially dangerous attitudes in the various components of health systems.  aPublisher supplied data 0aReductionist program 0aComplex thought 0aPhilosophy of Biology 0aHegemonic medical model 0aIatrogenic 0aPublic health 0aPrograma reduccionista 0aPensamiento complejo 0aFilosofía de la biología 0aModelo médico 0aHegemónico 0aIatropatogenia 0aSalud pública0 tBoletín médico del Hospital Infantil de México.g2017 Mar.,  Apr., v. 74 p.154-163dMasson Doyma México S.A.aHospital Infantil de México Federico GómezwJournal:23519x2444-34097nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bmhime.2017.11.0213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02740naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002200151245011000173300001600283520133800299592002801637650000801665650001301673650001201686650002501698650001401723650001001737650001301747650001501760650001701775650001201792650002501804650001401829651001401843651001601857653002101873653001801894653002901912653002201941653002401963700001901987700002402006773014602030856008502176852000902261655001202270IND60711301520221116155403.0200921e20200402xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071130152DNAL7 a10.1080/00288330.2020.17131802doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aColgan, Donald J.12aA genetic assessment of the taxonomic status of New Zealand mussels of the genus Xenostrobus Wilson, 1967  ap. 271-285.  aThe genus Xenostrobus consists of small, marine and estuarine mussels that all appear similar externally. One of its estuarine species, Xenostrobus securis, with a native range in New Zealand and Australia, has become invasive in the Northern Hemisphere. No genetic data are available to determine if X. securis populations from the two countries are conspecific. Additionally, marine Xenostrobus from New Zealand have often been regarded as a species, X. neozelanicus, distinct fromthe marine Australian species X. pulex. We combined new DNA sequences with published data to assess the taxonomic status of New Zealand Xenostrobus. The data comprised 658 aligned bases of mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) gene and 331 bases of nuclear histone H3. There was no evidence that X. securis populations from Australia and New Zealand are specifically distinct. Northern Hemisphere specimens of X. securis belonged to Australian, not New Zealand, clades in phylogenetic analyses of COI data, suggesting the former country as their more likely original source. The results confirm that X. neozelanicus and X. pulex are distinct species and for nomenclatural completeness for this taxonomic decision a lectotype is designated for Mytilus ater Zelebor in Dunker and Zelebor, 1866 [ = Modiolus neozelanicus Iredale, 1915].  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aModiolus 3aMytilus 3acytochrome-c oxidase 3aestuaries 3agenes 3ahistones 3alectotypes 3amitochondria 3amussels 3anucleotide sequences 3aphylogeny 3aAustralia 3aNew Zealand 0aInvasive species 0aDNA sequences 0aXenostrobus neozelanicus 0aXenostrobus pulex 0aXenostrobus securis1 aWillan, R.

(Hymenoptera: Apidae), was compared with that of locally produced, commercial Italian bees during 2004-2006 in beekeeping operations in Alabama, USA. Infestations of varroa mites, Varroa destructor Anderson & Truman (Acari: Varroidae), were measured twice each year, and colonies that reached established economic treatment thresholds (one mite per 100 adult bees in late winter; 5-10 mites per 100 adult bees in late summer) were treated with acaricides. Infestations of tracheal mites, Acarapis woodi (Rennie) (Acari: Tarsonemidae), were measured autumn and compared with a treatment threshold of 20% mite prevalence. Honey production was measured in 2005 and 2006 for colonies that retained original test queens. Throughout the three seasons of measurement, resistant stocks required less treatment against parasitic mites than the Italian stock. The total percentages of colonies needing treatment against varroa mites were 12% of VSH, 24% of Russian, and 40% of Italian. The total percentages requiring treatment against tracheal mites were 1% of Russian, 8% of VSH and 12% of Italian. The average honey yield of Russian and VSH colonies was comparable with that of Italian colonies each year. Beekeepers did not report any significant behavioral problems with the resistant stocks. These stocks thus have good potential for use in nonmigratory beekeeping operations in the southeastern United States. 3aapiculture 3ainsect behavior 3aparasitic mites 3aApis mellifera 3aeconomic threshold 3ahoney bees 3astrain differences 3aVarroa destructor 3aAcarapis woodi 3abiological resistance 3ahoney 2aAnimals 2aBeesxparasitologyxphysiology. 2aBehavior, Animal 2aHoney 2aImmunity, Innate 2aMite Infestationsxepidemiologyxveterinary. 2aMitesxpathogenicity 2aSeasons 3aAlabama 0aAlabama 0atracheal mites 0amite resistance 0amites 0ahoney yield 0avarroa sensitive hygiene1 aDanka, R.1 aWard, R.0 tJournal of economic entomology.g2008 June, v.  101, no.  3 p.654-659dEntomological Society of Americax0022-04937nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1603/0022-0493(2008)101%5B654:CPOTMS%5D2.0.CO;23Available from publisher's Web site40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/173483Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20080728b20080801c00000000  aINDdNZMe2008/07/28  aOther US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle02357naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001600146245006000162300001600222520120500238592002801443650001101471650001201482650001301494650001101507650001901518650001401537650001801551651001801569653001101587653002701598653002501625653003301650653001801683700001701701700001701718773011001735856008001845961001301925852000901938655001201947IND60616535820221119045246.0181017e201403  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061653582DNAL7 a10.1177/00405175134994302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMontalvo, J10aSplit-replicates correlation of water content in cotton  ap. 435-445.  aThe range of water content in US cottons equilibrated to moisture equilibrium at standard textile testing conditions and analyzed by standard Karl Fischer Titration is small, <0.8%. This presents a challenge in obtaining accurate test data to calibrate fast sensors. A dozen raw cottons, nine American and three international, were analyzed for water by standard Karl Fischer Titration. The number of replicates analyzed, blending, and two conditioning systems – either standard room or closed chamber in the standard room with salt solution to control humidity – were examined. Split-replicates correlation within samples, by splitting out either half the available number or three replicates at a time, was used as the measure of correlation. The split-correlation results depended on the number of replicates, mixing of the laboratory sample, and method of conditioning. These results suggest that good correlations are possible when mean water content is the dependent variable in regressions with fast sensor data. This improved understanding of the correlation behavior, which is important for optimal application of methods to measure water in samples equilibrated to moisture equilibrium.  aPublisher supplied data 3acotton 3afabrics 3ahumidity 3amixing 3atextile fibers 3atitration 3awater content 3aUnited States 0acotton 0aKarl Fischer Titration 0amoisture equilibrium 0asplit-replicates correlation 0awater content1 aVon Hoven, T1 aRodgers, J.,0 tTextile research journal.g, v. 84, no. 4 p.435-445dSAGE PublicationswJournal:jnl46536x1746-77487nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/00405175134994303Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/ARS  aDNAL 7aarticle02521naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002200150245009500172300001600267520090700283592002801190650002101218650001401239650001801253650001801271650001701289650001701306650001101323650001401334650001401348650002801362650001101390650001001401650002001411650001201431650002501443650001701468650001601485651001001501653002001511653001501531653001001546653003101556653001401587653001501601700001901616700002601635700003001661700003101691700002301722773011601745856008501861852000901946655001201955IND60598177220221116152616.0201206e201809  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059817722DNAL7 a10.1016/j.meegid.2018.04.0352doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBoundenga, Larson10aDiversity and prevalence of gastrointestinal parasites in two wild Galago species in Gabon  ap. 249-256.  aIn this study, we characterize the diversity and estimated infection levels of gastrointestinal parasites circulating in two galago species, Galago demidoff and G. thomasi in two sites situated in the Southeastern forests of Gabon. Our study reveals that eleven parasites including nine helminthes (Ascaris spp., Ankylostoma spp., Dicrocoelium spp., Gongylonema spp., Oesophagostomum spp., Lemuricola spp., Strongyloides spp. Trichostrongylus spp. and Trichuris spp.) and two protozoans (Balantidium spp. and Entamoeba spp.) may infect Galago spp. with high infection rates. The results show that: a very similar parasite spectrum is found in both host species; all the taxa identified were previously observed in other Primate species and/or Man.

We assessed the correlation of five single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of CD81 (rs800136, rs2651842, rs2522012, rs800146, and rs708564) and SCARB1 rs10846744 polymorphisms with treatment responses in 395 treatment-naïve patients with chronic HCV (CHC) genotype 1 treated with pegylated interferon-α and ribavirin (pegIFN-α/RBV). The frequency of rapid virologic response (RVR), complete early virologic response (cEVR) and sustained virologic response (SVR) were 57.2%, 55.2%, and 58.2%, respectively. RVR, cEVR, and SVR were significantly associated with CD81 rs800136 (CC), CD81 rs2651842 (AA), CD81 rs708564 (TT), and SCARB1 rs10846744 (CC). High rates of RVR, cEVR, and SVR were reported for the CD81 rs800136 (CC), CD81 rs2651842 (AA), and CD81 rs708564 (TT) genotypes when correlated with higher levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and lower levels of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) as well as lower levels of HDL and LDL in the SCARB1 rs10846744 (CC) genotype. In addition, patients with GG genotype had higher fasting blood glucose (FBS) level than those with CC genotype. In conclusion, CD81 and SCARB1 SNPs may serve as powerful predictor factors for treatment responses in CHC patients, and this effect is correlated with serum lipoprotein and FBS levels.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHepatitis C virus 3ablood glucose 3ablood serum 3achronic hepatitis C 3agenotype 3ahigh density lipoprotein 3ainterferon-alpha 3alow density lipoprotein 3apatients 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism 0aCluster of differentiation 81 0aScavenger receptor class B member 1 0aRapid virological response 0aComplete early virological response 0aSustained virological response1 aIrani, Shiva1 aVaziri, Farzam1 aGharibzadeh, Safoora1 aSakhaee, Fatemeh1 aKhazeni, Mohammad1 aKalhor, Naser1 aJamnani, Fatemeh Rahimi1 aSiadat, Seyed Davar1 aFateh, Abolfazl0 tInfection, genetics, and evolution.g2018 Aug., v. 62 p.296-303dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12450x1567-13487nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.meegid.2018.04.0383Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04435naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002000145245014600165300001600311506002800327520312400355592002803479506003703507650000903544650002403553650000903577650002103586650003403607650001403641650001203655650001503667650001703682653001903699653003803718653002103756700002803777700002503805773010603830856008003936852000904016655001204025IND60774817420221207083400.0170313e201702  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077481742DNAL7 a10.22146/agritech.167582doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSusilo, Bambang10aPengaruh Penyimpanan Atmosfer Termodifikasi (Modified Atmosphere Storage/ MAS) terhadap Karakteristik Jamur Tiram Putih (Pleurotus ostreatus)  ap. 369-378.  aResource is Open Access  aThe food storing technology is growing fast. Since the optimal storage could increase the value of the material being stored. A proposed solution to overcome counter this issue is the use of modified atmosphere storage (MAS) technology. White oyster mushroom (Pleurotus ostreatus) is one of vegetables that is highly perishable that makes this mushroom has a short shelf life. Therefore, appropriate postharvest handling is needed to maintain the quality of oyster mushrooms by expanding its shelf life. The aims of this research were to assess the effect of the use of MAS technology and to characterize the white oyster mushroom. Based on the research conducted at the Laboratory of Agricultural Processing and Postharvest Engineering, Department of Agricultural Engineering, Brawijaya University showed that the modified atmosphere storage of white oyster mushroom affected the respiration rate and shelf life of the studied commodities. On the basis of the observations on each parameter (respiration rate and storage time), the normal storage time for white oyster mushrooms is 1 day. While iby applying MAS, the white oyster mushrooms could last for 3 days using treatment A (21 % O) and B (12,4 – 12,5 % O), and could last for 4 days using treatment C (9,2– 9,3 % O2) , D (5,9 – 6,1 % O2), and E (3,5 – 3,7 % O). Therefore, It can be concluded that by using MAS storage at low O2 concentrations, the shelf life of mushrooms could be longer. ABSTRAK Teknologi penyimpanan saat ini berkembang cukup pesat. Hal ini dikarenakan penyimpanan yang optimal akan meningkatkan nilai dari bahan yang disimpan. Salah satu upaya yang dapat dilakukan untuk hal tersebut yaitu penyimpanan menggunakan metode atmosfer termodifikasi (Modified Atmosphere Storage/MAS). Jamur tiram putih (Pleurotus ostreatus) merupakan salah satu komoditas sayuran yang bersifat mudah rusak, hal ini membuat jenis jamur ini memiliki umur simpan yang terbilang singkat. Oleh karena itu, penanganan pasca panen yang tepat pun dibutuhkan agar kualitas jamur tiram dapat dipertahankan sehingga umur simpannya juga lebih lama. Tujuan penelitian ini adalah untuk mengkaji pengaruh penggunaan teknologi penyimpanan dengan MAS terhadap karakteristik jamur tiram putih. Berdasarkan penelitian yang telah dilakukan di Laboratorium Teknik Prosesing Hasil Pertanian, Jurusan Keteknikan Pertanian, Universitas Brawijaya, menunjukkan bahwa penyimpanan dengan atmosfer termodifikasi dapat mempengaruhi laju respirasi dan lama simpan komoditas jamur tiram putih. Hasil pengamatan pada tiap parameter (laju respirasi dan lama penyimpanan) dapat diketahui bahwa lama simpan jamur tiram putih pada kondisi normal adalah 1 hari. Sedangkan pada kondisi penyimpanan menggunakan metode atmosfer termodifikasi jamur tiram putih dapat bertahan selama 3 hari pada perlakuan A (21 % O2) dan B (12,4 – 12,5 % O), dan bertahan selam 4 hari pada perlakuan C (9,2 – 9,3 % O2), D (5,9 – 6,1 % O2), dan E (3,5 – 3,7 % O2). Sehingga dapat disimpulkan bahwa dengan menggunakan penyimpanan MAS pada konsentrasi O2 yang rendah maka umur simpan jamur akan semakin lama.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aLama 3aPleurotus ostreatus 3aagar 3acell respiration 3acontrolled atmosphere storage 3amushrooms 3aoysters 3ashelf life 3astorage time 0aCharacteristic 0amodified atmosphere storage (MAS) 0aoyster mushrooms1 aAgustiningrum, Dyah Ayu1 aIndriani, Dina Wahyu0 tAgritech.g2017 Feb., v. 36, no. 4 p.369-378dUniversitas Gadjah MadawJournal:27886x2527-38257nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.22146/agritech.167583Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02355naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002200146245010000168300001800268520101700286592002801303650001201331650001601343650000901359650000901368650001501377650002701392650002001419650002001439650001301459650001801472650001001490653000801500653000901508653001701517653001701534653001301551700002201564700002401586700006201610773014801672856008001820852000901900655001201909IND60613362320221118233428.0180912e20180810xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061336232DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jafc.8b019432doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZangaro, Casey A.10aEnhancing the Nutritive Value of Corn Whole Stillage for Pigs via Pretreatment and Predigestion  ap. 9409-9417.  aCorn DDGS is poorly digested by pigs. Pretreatment or predigestion of whole stillage (WS; slurry material from which DDGS is derived) can potentially improve corn DDGS digestibility. Thus, a study was conducted to determine the effects of pretreating WS with heat (160 °C and 70 psi for 20 min) alone or in combination with citric acid (10 g/L; CA), sulfuric acid (90 mM; H₂SO₄), or ammonia (1%), without or with subsequent multienzymatic hydrolysis for 24 h, on porcine digestibility. Dried untreated, heat-pretreated, CA-pretreated, H₂SO₄-pretreated, and ammonia-pretreated WS contained 23, 21, 12 19, and 18% total nonstarch polysaccharides, respectively. Pretreatment increased in vitro digestibility of dry matter of WS by ∼11 (CA) to ∼15% units (ammonia). Multienzyme hydrolysis increased in vitro digestibility of dry matter of WS by ∼6 (ammonia-treated WS) to ∼18% units (untreated WS). Thus, pretreatment or predigestion can improve the digestibility of WS and hence the resulting DDGS.  aPublisher supplied data 3aammonia 3acitric acid 3acorn 3aheat 3ahydrolysis 3ain vitro digestibility 3anutritive value 3apolysaccharides 3aslurries 3asulfuric acid 3aswine 0apig 0aDDGS 0apredigestion 0apretreatment 0ain vitro1 aPatterson, Robert1 aGibbons, William R.1 aWoyengo, Tofuko A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6955-02440 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2018 Aug. 10, v. 66, no. 36 p.9409-9417dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:12177x1520-51187nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jafc.8b019433Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03115naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100006800150245014900218300001400367520178500381592002802166650001602194650001902210650001302229650002502242650001802267650001502285651001402300651001902314653001802333653001102351653002002362653001802382653001902400700003402419700003302453700002302486773010202509856008502611852000902696655001202705IND60566558320221121015350.0190411e201705  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056655832DNAL7 a10.1016/j.seares.2017.03.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDurán-Campos, Elizabeth1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8730-343910aPatterns of chlorophyll-a distribution linked to mesoscale structures in two contrasting areas Campeche Canyon and Bank, Southern Gulf of Mexico  ap. 30-38.  aThe chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) distribution in Campeche Canyon and Campeche Bank, at the Southern Gulf of Mexico, as well as its relationship with hydrographic structure were analyzed. The results show the existence of the Gulf Common Water (GCW), the Caribbean Tropical Surface Water (CTSW) and the Caribbean Subtropical Underwater (CSUW) in the 120m upper layer at the Campeche Canyon. While at the Campeche Bank only the Caribbean Tropical Surface Water (CTSW) was found. The 15°C and 18.5°C isotherms topography depict the presence of a mesoscale anticyclone-cyclone dipole. The nutrient pumping mechanism fertilizes the eutrophic zone promoted by the cyclonic eddy. Submesoscale processes in the border of an anticyclone and a cyclone results in maximum of nitrate concentration and vertically integrated Chl-a at the frontal zone. Two Chl-a vertical distribution patterns were found, a deep maximum at the base of the euphotic layer not associated to the thermocline over the Campeche Canyon and a peak associated to the thermocline related to the shallow bottom at the Campeche Bank. Oligotrophic conditions were observed in the 50m upper layer and mesotrophic conditions were found below this layer. The differences between the Campeche Bank and Campeche Canyon are that: in the canyon, the nutrient and Chl-a peaks were linked with the cyclone, and the submesoscale processes in the border of an anticyclone and a cyclone, respectively. In the vertical the maximum Chl-a was associated to the base of the euphotic layer and dominated by coccolithophores. In the Campeche Bank the nutrient and Chl-a peaks were influenced by the shelf break in the vertical the maximum Chl-a was associated with the thermocline and the silicoflagellate was identified as the dominant species.  aPublisher supplied data 3achlorophyll 3aeutrophication 3anitrates 3aspatial distribution 3asurface water 3atopography 3aCaribbean 3aGulf of Mexico 0aChlorophyll-a 0aEddies 0aCampeche canyon 0aCampeche bank 0aGulf of Mexico1 aSalas-de-León, David Alberto1 aMonreal-Gómez, María Adela1 aCoria-Monter, Erik0 tJournal of sea research.g2017 May, v. 123 p.30-38dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12050x1385-11017nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.seares.2017.03.0133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03076naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245006600168300001600234520151500250592002801765650002701793650002001820650001501840650001101855650001401866650001201880650001301892650001401905650001301919650001301932650001801945651001701963653002001980653000902000653002102009653002102030653001502051653001302066700001502079700001502094700001502109700001502124700001302139700001802152700001602170700001602186700001302202700001802215700001402233700001502247700001502262700002002277773011702297856005102414852000902465655001202474IND50086972420221120182845.0140412e20110401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5008697242DNAL7 a10.2989/1814232X.2011.5723772doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCrawford, RJM10aCollapse of South Africa's penguins in the early 21st century  ap. 139-156.  aThe number of African penguins Spheniscus demersus breeding in South Africa collapsed from about 56 000 pairs in 2001 to some 21 000 pairs in 2009, a loss of 35 000 pairs (>60%) in eight years. This reduced the global population to 26 000 pairs, when including Namibian breeders, and led to classification of the species as Endangered. In South Africa, penguins breed in two regions, the Western Cape and Algoa Bay (Eastern Cape), their breeding localities in these regions being separated by c. 600 km. Their main food is anchovy Engraulis encrasicolus and sardine Sardinops sagax, which are also the target of purse-seine fisheries. In Algoa Bay, numbers of African penguins halved from 21 000 pairs in 2001 to 10 000 pairs in 2003. In the Western Cape, numbers decreased from a mean of 35 000 pairs in 2001–2005 to 11 000 pairs in 2009. At Dassen Island, the annual survival rate of adult penguins decreased from 0.70 in 2002/2003 to 0.46 in 2006/2007; at Robben Island it decreased from 0.77 to 0.55 in the same period. In both the Western and Eastern Cape provinces, long-term trends in numbers of penguins breeding were significantly related to the combined biomass of anchovy and sardine off South Africa. However, recent decreases in the Western Cape were greater than expected given a continuing high abundance of anchovy. In this province, there was a south-east displacement of prey around 2000, which led to a mismatch in the distributions of prey and the western breeding localities of penguins.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEngraulis encrasicolus 3aSardinops sagax 3aSpheniscus 3aadults 3aanchovies 3abiomass 3abreeding 3afisheries 3apenguins 3asardines 3asurvival rate 3aSouth Africa 0aAfrican penguin 0adiet 0anumbers breeding 0anumbers moulting 0aSpheniscus 0asurvival1 aAltwegg, R1 aBarham, BJ1 aBarham, PJ1 aDurant, JM1 aDyer, BM1 aGeldenhuys, D1 aMakhado, AB1 aPichegru, L1 aRyan, PG1 aUnderhill, LG1 aUpfold, L1 aVisagie, J1 aWaller, LJ1 aWhittington, PA0 tAfrican journal of marine science.g2011 Apr. 1, v. 33, no. 1 p.139-156dTaylor & Francis Groupx1814-23387nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2989/1814232X.2011.572377  aDNAL 7aarticle02576naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100006400150245010400214500001900318520122400337592002801561650002401589650001401613650001101627650001201638650002501650650002201675650001101697650001501708650001501723650001301738650001701751650002101768653002401789653001001813653003601823653001701859700006201876700002001938773009001958856008502048852000902133655001202142IND60720595520221119065943.0210305e20210315xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072059552DNAL7 a10.1016/j.energy.2020.1195372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCozzolino, Raffaello1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2991-992110aOff-grid PV/URFC power plant fueled with biogas from food waste: An energetic and economic analysis  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThis paper presents the design, energy management and economic analysis of an off-grid power plant for a strip mall. The main goal is to achieve a 100% renewable operation, by using a photovoltaic panel array coupled to a battery and a unitized regenerative solid oxide fuel cell fed both with self-generated hydrogen and biogas produced from food waste in an on-site anaerobic digester. The power plant has been modeled by means of a self-made Matlab/Simulink® simulator and the plant operation has been simulated against different radiation and load demand scenarios. Results are compared both in terms of energetic and economic performance. In particular, it is observed that the annualized capital costs for unitized regenerative solid oxide fuel cell cover from 50% up to 58% of the total investment cost and from 71% up to 75% of the total replacement costs. Depending on the scenario and the specific tipping fee, tipping costs vary from a minimum of 9,793 $/y to a maximum 47,335 $/y. For all the analyzed scenarios, the cost of energy is higher than the grid electricity price, but the 100% renewable operation of the plant and the on-site waste conversion to biogas make this solution worth of investigation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanaerobic digesters 3abatteries 3abiogas 3acapital 3aeconomic performance 3aelectricity costs 3aenergy 3afood waste 3afuel cells 3ahydrogen 3apower plants 3asolar collectors 0aCommercial building 0aSolar 0aUnitized regenerative fuel cell 0aClimate zone1 aChiappini, Daniele1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5316-44341 aTribioli, Laura0 tEnergy.g2021 Mar. 15, v. 219 p.119537-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12436x0360-54427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2020.1195373Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01464naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001500140245014300155300001800298520032000316592002800636650002300664650002300687650001700710650002100727650001700748650001800765650001800783700002400801700002400825700002300849700002500872773013400897856007401031852000901105655001201114IND60639089720221120164259.0190501e20170328xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063908972DNAL7 a10.1039/c7cc00265c2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYin, Jiefu10aMagnesium-ion battery-relevant electrochemistry of MgMn₂O₄: crystallite size effects and the notable role of electrolyte water content  ap. 3665-3668.  aMgMn₂O₄ nanoparticles with crystallite sizes of 11 (MMO-1) and 31 nm (MMO-2) were synthesized and their magnesium-ion battery-relevant electrochemistry was investigated.

The objective of this study was to compare the satiety impact of oatmeal with the most widely sold ready-to-eat breakfast cereal (RTEC) when either was consumed as a breakfast meal. Methods: Forty-eight healthy individuals ≥18 years of age were enrolled in a randomized crossover trial. Following an overnight fast, subjects consumed either oatmeal or RTEC in random order at least a week apart. The breakfasts were isocaloric and contained 363 kcal (250 kcal cereal, 113 kcal milk). Visual analogue scales measuring appetite and satiety were completed before breakfast and throughout the morning. The content and physicochemical properties of oat β-glucan were determined. Appetite and satiety responses were analyzed by area under the curve (AUC). Physicochemical properties were analyzed using t tests. Results: Oatmeal, higher in fiber and protein but lower in sugar than the RTEC, resulted in greater increase in fullness (AUC: p = 0.005 [120 minute: p = 0.0408, 180 minute: p = 0.0061, 240 minute: p = 0.0102]) and greater reduction in hunger (AUC: p = 0.0009 [120 minute: p = 0.0197, 180 minute: p = 0.0003, 240 minute: p = 0.0036]), desire to eat (AUC: p = 0.0002 [120 minute: p = 0.0168, 180 minute: p < 0.0001, 240 minute: p = 0.0022]), and prospective intake (AUC: p = 0.0012 [120 minute: p = 0.0058, 180 minute: p = 0.006, 240 minute: p = 0.0047]) compared to the RTEC. Oatmeal had higher β-glucan content, higher molecular weight (p < 0.0001), higher viscosity (p = 0.025), and larger hydration spheres (p = 0.0012) than the RTEC. Conclusion: Oatmeal improves appetite control and increases satiety. The effects may be attributed to the viscosity and hydration properties of its β-glucan content.  aPublisher supplied data 3abeta-glucans 3abreakfast 3across-over studies 3ahunger 3amilk 3amolecular weight 3aoatmeal 3aoats 3aready-to-eat foods 3asatiety 3asugars 3aviscosity 0aoats 0abreakfast cereal 0asatiety 0aβ-glucan 0aviscosity1 aJohnson, William D.1 aMartin, Corby K.1 aXie, Wenting1 aO’Shea, Marianne1 aKurilich, Anne1 aBordenave, Nicolas1 aAndler, Stephanie1 aKlinken, B.

This has prompted concern over the resource and has initiated an assessment of the current status of the stock. The limited available biological information suggests that the main pulse of recruitment into the lagoon occurs in the first few months of the year, but that exact timing varies between years and additional staggered recruitment may occur throughout the year. Size frequency information suggests that the brooding period may be variable and extended, with a main peak between October and January. Catch-and-effort data were also limited, but a decreasing trend in catch per unit effort in two of the datasets examined allowed some preliminary within-season assessment of population size (using a depletion model) at selected landing sites. The use of a migration bias correction formula suggested a net emigration from the lagoon, which might be indicative of adult movement into deeper waters. Depletion models seem to be useful as a management tool and should be tested further against more substantial monthly catch-and-effort data. In the interim, a precautionary approach of instituting a national seasonal closure for octopus fishing following periods of peak recruitment may have both economic and conservation benefits.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadults 3adata collection 3amodels 3apopulation size 3aIndian Ocean 3aMauritius 0agrowth 0amanagement recruitment 0aOctopus cyanea 0aregulations 0areproduction 0astock assessment1 aPotts, W1 aRaberinary, D1 aAnderson, J.,1 aSylvio Perrine, MJ0 tAfrican journal of marine science.g2011 Apr. 1, v. 33, no. 1 p.181-187dTaylor & Francis Groupx1814-23387nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2989/1814232X.2011.572386  aDNAL 7aarticle02793naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002500147245011000172300001600282520147600298592002801774650002501802650001301827650001201840650003501852650002701887650002001914650001201934650001701946650000901963650001701972650001401989650001002003650001402013650001002027650001102037650001302048650001302061651000902074700002402083700002202107773011602129856008102245852000902326655001202335IND60522924420221122230946.0160604e201607  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052292442DNAL7 a10.1007/s00343-016-5128-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEsmaeilzadeh, Marjan10aHeavy metals in sediments and their bioaccumulation in Phragmites australis in the Anzali wetland of Iran  ap. 810-820.  aAccumulation of metals in both sediments and Phragmites australis organs was studied. Samples were collected from seven stations located in Anzali wetland, Iran. The samples were analyzed by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). The results showed that concentration of the studied metals (except As and Cd) were higher in sediments than in P. australis organs. Metal accumulation was found to be significantly (P <0.05) higher in roots than in above-ground organs of P. australis. The bioaccumulation factor (BAF) and the transfer factor (TF) also verified the highest rate of metal accumulation in roots and their reduced mobility from roots to the above-ground organs. Pearson correlation coefficient showed significant relationships between metal concentrations in sediments and those in plant organs. It should be pointed out that sediment and plant samples exhibited higher metal concentrations in eastern and central parts than in western and southern parts of the wetland. The mean concentrations of all studied elements (except for Fe, V and Al) were higher in these sediment samples than in the Earth’s crust and shale. High accumulation of metals in P. australis organs (roots and shoots) is indicative of their high bioavailability in sediments of the wetland. The correlation between metal concentrations in sediments and in P. australis indicates that plant organs are good bioindicators of metal pollution in sediments of Anzali wetland.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPhragmites australis 3aaluminum 3aarsenic 3aatomic absorption spectrometry 3abioaccumulation factor 3abioavailability 3acadmium 3aheavy metals 3airon 3aplant organs 3apollution 3aroots 3asediments 3ashale 3ashoots 3avanadium 3awetlands 3aIran1 aKarbassi, Abdolreza1 aMoattar, Faramarz0 tChinese journal of oceanology and limnology.g2016 July, v. 34, no. 4 p.810-820dScience Pressx0254-40597nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00343-016-5128-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04834naa a2200637 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001100149245013000160520294200290592002803232596007503260650002403335650002203359650003103381650001303412650002103425650001103446650001003457650002003467650001403487650001203501650001403513650001803527650001003545650002203555650001603577650002103593650001403614650001403628650001303642650001803655650001403673650002203687650001803709650002203727650001103749650001103760650001603771650001203787651001003799653002303809653001103832653004903843700001803892700001503910700001403925700005103939773010203990856008304092852000904175655001204184IND60682788020221117181050.0200131e202002  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068278802DNAL7 a10.1094/PDIS-08-19-1705-PDN2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLu, Qi10aFirst Report of Pectobacterium carotovorum subsp. actinidiae Causing Summer Canker on Kiwifruit in Zhejiang Province of China  aZhejiang Province of China is a critical area of kiwifruit production with 10,000 ha and approximately 82,800 metric tons per year. In September 2019, a new disease was observed on kiwifruit (Actinidia chinensis var. chinensis) cultivar ‘Hongyang’ in Lishui City, Zhejiang Province, China. About 3% of diseased plants were observed in orchards of approximately 15 ha. Symptoms were characterized by red-rust exudation on canes and brown die-back on stems, which were similar to those caused by bacterial canker of kiwifruit on A. chinensis. In total, 11 representative bacterial colonies were isolated from infected stems on King’s B medium (KB) and labeled as LQ-1 to LQ-11. Bacteria were gram negative, rod shaped, and facultatively anaerobic on KB; sensitive to tetrazolium, positive for raffinose utilization, and positive for tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum ‘White Burley’) hypersensitivity. Identity of the two isolates was confirmed by sequencing the 16S rRNA gene (Koh et al. 2012); two sequences from LQ-1 and LQ-2 (MN235843 and MN235844, respectively) showed 99.50% (1,398/1,405 and 1,397/1,403) identity with the sequence of Pectobacterium carotovorum subsp. actinidiae strain KKH3 (NR125539). The genomes of isolates LQ-1 and LQ-2, which were deposited in the China Center for Type Culture Collection under accessions AB 2019027 and AB 2019020, were sequenced using the Oxford Nanopore GridION X5. The complete sequences of LQ-1 and LQ-2 are available in the GenBank database under accession numbers SUB6087232 and SUB6087643. By JSpeciesWS (Richter et al. 2016), LQ-1 and LQ-2 showed 98.77 and 98.76% identity to P. carotovorum subsp. actinidiae KKH3 via ANIb (average nucleotide identity by BLAST) (Visnovsky et al. 2017). Pathogenicity tests were confirmed by artificial inoculation of 2-year-old A. chinensis var. chinensis from the greenhouse. A bacterial suspension with 10 μl of 5 × 10⁶ CFU/ml was injected into kiwifruit shoots, and control shoots were treated with sterile distilled water. The inoculated plants were placed at 30 ± 3°C in moist chambers (approximately 90% relative humidity) for 7 days. All treated strains caused blight of shoots, but not on the water-treated control plants. Reisolation was performed from symptomatic shoots, and their identities were confirmed using the above-mentioned methods. All tests were performed three times, and pathogenicity tests employed three plants for each strain. P. carotovorum subsp. actinidiae was previously observed in Korea, Sichuan, and Jianxi Province of China (Koh et al. 2012; Wu et al. 2017; Yan et al. 2019). To our knowledge, this is the first report of P. carotovorum subsp. actinidiae causing summer canker on kiwifruit in Zhejiang Province of China. Kiwifruit production in China has expanded rapidly during the last 40 years, and phytosanitary measures are needed to prevent further spread of the bacterium to other kiwifruit orchards.  aPublisher supplied data  a2018YFD1000306cNational Key Research and Development Program of China 3aActinidia chinensis 3aNicotiana tabacum 3aPectobacterium carotovorum 3abacteria 3abacterial canker 3ablight 3acanes 3acrop production 3acultivars 3adieback 3aexudation 3afruit growing 3agenes 3agenetic databases 3agreenhouses 3ahypersensitivity 3akiwifruit 3ananopores 3aorchards 3apathogenicity 3araffinose 3arelative humidity 3aribosomal RNA 3asequence analysis 3ashoots 3asummer 3atetrazolium 3atobacco 3aChina 0abacterial pathogen 0acanker 0aPectobacterium carotovorum subsp. actinidiae1 aLiu, Yuanyuan1 aYan, Fuhua1 aZhu, Liwu1 aLiu, Pu1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2624-79980 tPlant disease.g2020 Feb., v. 104, no. 2 p.561-dPlant DiseasewJournal:jnl30858x0191-29177nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094/PDIS-08-19-1705-PDN3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02501naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002200150245012200172300001400294520121500308592002801523650002501551650002501576650001701601650002801618650001701646650001501663650001201678650001901690650001501709650001101724653002601735653002701761653001201788653002201800653001701822700001701839700002001856773011001876856008401986852000902070655001202079IND60633898420221120195017.0190321e20180615xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063389842DNAL7 a10.1016/j.memsci.2018.03.0692doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAhmed, Farah Ejaz10aElectrically conductive membranes for in situ fouling detection in membrane distillation using impedance spectroscopy  ap. 66-72.  aOnline monitoring of fouling in desalination processes enables early and appropriate action for fouling control. This study demonstrates the use of Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) to electrically conductive membranes for online monitoring of fouling by eliminating the need for external electrodes and/or canary cells. Electrically conductive membranes are prepared by incorporation of silica in carbon nanostructures and subsequent fluorination to yield hydrophobic membranes. These membranes are applied to direct contact membrane distillation with 99.9% salt rejection and a flux of 4.3 LMH. EIS is used for online monitoring of inorganic fouling on the membrane surface during the MD process. Impedance spectra taken over a duration of 15 h indicated that impedance in the low frequency (<100 Hz) region gradually decreased with fouling early on, and increased towards the end. Impedance-based monitoring is more sensitive to changes in the system than monitoring of flux and permeate conductivity. This work shows that EIS detection can provide an earlier feedback on fouling occurrences before it can affect the performance of the membrane by reducing the flux and permeate conductivity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aartificial membranes 3acarbon nanoparticles 3adesalination 3adielectric spectroscopy 3adistillation 3aelectrodes 3afouling 3ahydrophobicity 3amonitoring 3asilica 0aMembrane distillation 0aImpedance spectroscopy 0aFouling 0aOnline monitoring 0aDesalination1 aHilal, Nidal1 aHashaikeh, Raed0 tJournal of membrane science.g2018 June 15, v. 556 p.66-72dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12468x0376-73887nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.memsci.2018.03.0693Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle09138naa a2201573 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024003500135040001800170100006400188245012400252300001100376506007600387520176000463592002802223596004902251596005702300596005602357596005902413596005902472596009702531596009702628596005302725596005102778596006502829596004902894506003702943650002502980650002103005650001203026650001403038650001303052650001203065650001203077650001803089650001103107650001403118650001003132650001503142650001303157650002203170650002203192700006803214700006103282700006103343700006003404700006003464700002303524700006303547700006503610700006503675700006403740700002503804700002303829700005903852700006303911700006403974700002004038700006504058700002604123700002204149700005904171700001404230700005904244700005604303700006304359700006104422700006104483700006804544700006104612700006004673700005504733700007104788700001804859700005804877700006604935700005905001700006105060700001905121700005105140700001705191700006605208700005805274700005705332700006205389700006405451700006005515700002205575700006205597700002005659700006305679700001705742700001905759700005905778700002805837700005705865700001305922700006205935700006705997700005906064700005906123700006006182700005606242700006006298700005406358700002006412700001806432700006506450700006406515700006606579700001606645700002306661700001706684700001906701700006306720700006606783700002106849700002106870700006406891700002106955700005806976700002307034700003407057700006107091773010107152774011207253856009607365856008207461852000907543655001207552IND60635557020221207120209.0220929e201912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063555702DNAL7 a309354222pmid7 aPMC64445472pmcid7 a10.1186/s13059-019-1660-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPanfilio, Kristen A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6417-251X10aMolecular evolutionary trends and feeding ecology diversification in the Hemiptera, anchored by the milkweed bug genome  ap. 64.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: The Hemiptera (aphids, cicadas, and true bugs) are a key insect order, with high diversity for feeding ecology and excellent experimental tractability for molecular genetics. Building upon recent sequencing of hemipteran pests such as phloem-feeding aphids and blood-feeding bed bugs, we present the genome sequence and comparative analyses centered on the milkweed bug Oncopeltus fasciatus, a seed feeder of the family Lygaeidae. RESULTS: The 926-Mb Oncopeltus genome is well represented by the current assembly and official gene set. We use our genomic and RNA-seq data not only to characterize the protein-coding gene repertoire and perform isoform-specific RNAi, but also to elucidate patterns of molecular evolution and physiology. We find ongoing, lineage-specific expansion and diversification of repressive C2H2 zinc finger proteins. The discovery of intron gain and turnover specific to the Hemiptera also prompted the evaluation of lineage and genome size as predictors of gene structure evolution. Furthermore, we identify enzymatic gains and losses that correlate with feeding biology, particularly for reductions associated with derived, fluid nutrition feeding. CONCLUSIONS: With the milkweed bug, we now have a critical mass of sequenced species for a hemimetabolous insect order and close outgroup to the Holometabola, substantially improving the diversity of insect genomics. We thereby define commonalities among the Hemiptera and delve into how hemipteran genomes reflect distinct feeding ecologies. Given Oncopeltus’s strength as an experimental model, these new sequence resources bolster the foundation for molecular research and highlight technical considerations for the analysis of medium-sized invertebrate genomes.  aPublisher supplied data  aPA 2044/1-1cDeutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft  aSFB 680 project A12cDeutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft  aSFB 680 project A1cDeutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft  aU54 HG003273cNational Human Genome Research Institute  a5R01HG004483cNational Human Genome Research Institute  a31003A_143936cSchweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Förderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung  aPP00P3_170664cSchweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Förderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung  aERC-CoG #616346cH2020 European Research Council  aUS NSF DEB1257053cNational Science Foundation  a5R01GM080203cNational Institute of General Medical Sciences  aDE-AC02-05CH11231cU.S. Department of Energy0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aOncopeltus fasciatus 3aRNA interference 3aecology 3aevolution 3agenomics 3ainsects 3aintrons 3ainvertebrates 3amodels 3anutrition 3apests 3aphysiology 3aproteins 3asequence analysis 3azinc finger motif1 aVargas Jentzsch, Iris M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4527-15601 aBenoit, Joshua B.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4018-35131 aErezyilmaz, Deniz1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8416-85611 aSuzuki, Yuichiro1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0957-35641 aColella, Stefano1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3139-60551 aRobertson, Hugh M.1 aPoelchau, Monica F.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4584-60561 aWaterhouse, Robert M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4199-90521 aIoannidis, Panagiotis1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0939-67451 aWeirauch, Matthew T.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7977-91221 aHughes, Daniel S.

Six characters of D. indicus were compared between regions with and without deer herbivory on the Boso Peninsula. We found that D. indicus in browsed areas produced smaller leaves, thicker spines, and shorter internode distances between spines than those in unbrowsed areas whereas the length of spines and the angle of a pair of spines did not differ significantly. It is likely that D. indicus shows an induced resistance by producing smaller leaves, and by increasing stoutness of spines and spine density.  aPublisher supplied data 3adeer 3aherbivores 3ainduced resistance 3aleaves 3ashrubs1 aAsada, Masahiko1 aMiyashita, Tadashi0 tEcological research.g2001 Dec., v. 16, no. 4 p.809-813dSpringer-Verlagx0912-38147nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1440-1703.2001.00436.x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03692naa a2200793 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003600111040001800147100002200165245011900187300001600306500001500322520095000337592002801287650002801315650002301343650002201366650003401388650001301422650001801435650002401453650000901477650002301486650001801509650001601527650002001543650002801563650004601591650002601637650002801663650002501691650002501716650001201741650005201753650006701805650005001872650004601922650000901968650001601977650002801993650001102021650006102032650006302093650005302156650000902209650004202218650001502260650006502275650002402340650006402364651002602428651004102454653001502495700001802510700001802528700001702546700002202563700001802585700002002603700002102623700002602644773012402670852000902794856008302803655001202886IND4437965820221122004219.0181127e201006  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443796582DNAL7 a201385582pmid7 a10.1016/j.jfms.2009.12.0152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKelly, Patrick J.10aFeline immunodeficiency virus, feline leukemia virus and Bartonella species in stray cats on St Kitts, West Indies  ap. 435-440.  a2019-12-04  aStray cats trapped in various areas of Basseterre, the capital of St Kitts in the West Indies, were tested for infection with feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) and feline leukemia virus (FeLV) using commercial kits.

Sequential swelling of the substrate followed by a grafting-from reaction yielded an incompressible brush layer on the shape-memory substrate. Upon heating the substrate above the Tₘ to return to the primary shape, uniaxial wrinkles perpendicular to the direction of strain with sizes of 27–33 μm appear in addition to micrometer-sized features formed on the temporary shape after grafting. Swelling equilibration time (t₁) and grafting reaction time (t₂) were varied to control wrinkle formation and size. In this manner, we were able to create unique, anisotropic hierarchical surface structures with different length scales and patterns.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacrylates 3aazides 3aelectron transfer 3apolyethylene glycol 3ashape 3asurfaces1 aSheiko, Sergei S.1 aAshby, Valerie Sheares0 tLangmuir.g2015 May 19, v. 31, no. 19 p.5489-5494dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-58277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fla504826w3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02840naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100003400152245006200186520177600248592002802024650003002052650002202082650001302104650001602117653002902133653003702162653002002199653001902219700003302238700003102271773011602302856008702418852000902505655001202514IND60779776820221120082248.0220906e20220815xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077977682DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enconman.2022.1158572doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOlivares-Robles, Miguel Angel10aIso efficiency in nanostructured thermoelectric materials  aA study is carried out for the efficiency of segmented thermoelectric microgenerators (μSTEGs). The study includes a) n-type and p-type double or triple segmentation and b) geometry shape factor of the thermoelements. The temperature-dependent thermoelectric properties of nanostructured materials are determined from experimental data. In addition, the impact of internal resistance, as a function of the thermoelement-geometric shape factor, on the efficiency surfaces of the μSTEGs is studied based on non-equilibrium thermodynamics. Results show that the efficiency surfaces of different μSTEGs intersect under different working conditions. The curve formed by the intersection points of the efficiency surfaces of the two thermoelectric systems is called the iso-efficiency curve. Thus, segmented thermoelectric systems with different efficiencies can reach a common efficiency for a given segmentation and geometric shape form of their thermoelements under different working conditions. The common efficiency that reaches (corresponds to) these thermoelectric systems is called Iso efficiency. The iso efficiency is reached due to the n-type and p-type material segmentation and geometric shape, which affect each thermoelement’s internal resistance. Furthermore, the efficiency of a μSTEG system can be improved due to the combination of effects such as the relationship between load resistance and internal resistance when it is affected by the geometric shape, temperature difference, and segmentation. Our results allow determinate the new iso efficiency parameters with a good selection of the thermodynamic, electrical, and geometric parameters and establish guidance for other materials engineering investigations, to improve the efficiency of μSTEGs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadministrative management 3aenergy conversion 3ageometry 3atemperature 0aNanostructured materials 0aThermoelectric energy conversion 0aMicro-generator 0aIso efficiency1 aBadillo-Ruiz, Carlos Alberto1 aRuiz-Ortega, Pablo Eduardo0 tEnergy conversion and management.g2022 Aug. 15, v. 266 p.115857-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11831x0196-89047nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enconman.2022.1158573Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02721naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245010900169500001900278520142100297592002801718650001901746650001801765650002101783650001501804650001101819650001501830650001801845650001101863650002401874650002201898650001401920653002801934653001901962653002201981653002202003700001602025700001202041700002202053700001602075773009002091856008502181852000902266655001202275IND60720596020221119070104.0210121e20210301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072059602DNAL7 a10.1016/j.energy.2020.1195432doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Jingxian12aA prospective study of anti-vibration mechanism of microfluidic fuel cell via novel two-phase flow model  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aMicrofluidic fuel cell is considered as a cleaner energy conversion device, and has potential commercial applications in portable electronic devices owing to its appreciable output power, prolonged work time and low emission. In a liquid-fed cell, however, a gaseous phase is generated, and the corresponding vibration effects have a considerable influence on performance. Thus, it is important to analyse the effects of the two-phase flow and vibration on the characteristics of a microfluidic fuel cell. A two-phase computational model is constructed for a microfluidic fuel cell employing a flow-over electrode. Multiple physical processes are coupled in the model, including the hydrokinetics, electrochemical reaction kinetics, species transport, vibration field, Euler-Euler model, and phase transfer. Results indicate that the aggravated vibration intensity and frequency lead to a negative effect comprising a critical fuel crossover and delayed gaseous discharge, resulting in the cell performance degradation. Besides, increasing the contact angle and flow rate contribute to a reduction in the gaseous volume fraction, but the latter considerably sacrifices fuel utilisation and exergy efficiency. The present work provides insights for the future development of anti-vibration elements and optimised cell design, and offers a reference for the sustainable practical application of microfluidic fuel cell.  aPublisher supplied data 3abioinformatics 3acontact angle 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrodes 3aexergy 3afuel cells 3ahydrodynamics 3amodels 3aprospective studies 3areaction kinetics 3avibration 0aMicrofluidic fuel cells 0aTwo-phase flow 0aEuler-Euler model 0aExergy efficiency1 aXu, Peihang1 aLu, Jie1 aOuyang, Tiancheng1 aMo, Chunlan0 tEnergy.g2021 Mar. 01, v. 218 p.119543-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12436x0360-54427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2020.1195433Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02837naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245012900169520150100298592002801799650001401827650001701841650001301858650001301871650001601884650002601900650001301926650001601939650002501955650001901980653002601999653002002025653003002045653003102075653002802106700001802134700001202152700001802164700001302182773011302195856008602308852000902394655001202403IND60759695520221123020210.0211227e20220110xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075969552DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2021.1300142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLin, Xiangwei10aPolymer/expanded graphite-based flexible phase change material with high thermal conductivity for battery thermal management  aPhase change materials, as smart, ideal latent heat storage, and passive technology, have become the promising option for thermal management. However, the melting leakage, poor mechanical property, and intrinsic low thermal conductivity are long-standing bottlenecks for practical applications. In this study, a synergetic method is proposed to fabricate phase change composites with excellent shape stability, flexible property, and high thermal conductivity. Here, paraffin is used as thermal energy storage material, styrene-ethylene-propylene-styrene served as supporting material provides a cross-linked network to restrict paraffin molecular and endow the composite with thermal-induced flexibility, and expanded graphite with lamellar structure constructs an interconnected thermally network. The thermal conductivities of composites reach up to 2.671–10.019 W m⁻¹ K⁻¹ with EG loading of 5–30 wt%. Simultaneously, the phase transition enthalpy is measured as high as 155.4–211.9 kJ kg⁻¹, indicating that the composites have good thermal properties. In addition, the composites exhibit superior thermal management behavior by controlling the operating temperature of battery to below 50 °C under normal discharge-charge and dynamic stress test cycles. Therefore, this work offers a convenient and efficient method to synthesize scalable form-stable composite with promising performance for battery thermal management and other advanced thermal management applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3abatteries 3acrosslinking 3aenthalpy 3agraphene 3alatent heat 3amechanical properties 3apolymers 3atemperature 3athermal conductivity 3athermal energy 0aPhase change material 0aShape stability 0aHighly thermal conductive 0aBattery thermal management 0aDynamic driving profile1 aZhang, Xuelai1 aLiu, Lu1 aLiang, Jiyuan1 aLiu, Wei0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2022 Jan. 10, v. 331 p.130014-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2021.1300143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02509naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002200139245005700161300001800218520134300236592002801579650001201607650001801619650001701637650001301654650001301667650001901680650001201699650001801711650003401729650001101763700001901774700002401793700002801817700003201845700002301877700001701900773009801917856007502015852000902090655001202099IND60577244020171220000000.0170807e20150519xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057724402DNAL7 a10.1021/la504850x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNarhe, Ramchandra10aInverted Leidenfrost-like Effect during Condensation  ap. 5353-5363.  aWater droplets condensing on solidified phase change materials such as benzene and cyclohexane near their melting point show in-plane jumping and continuous “crawling” motion. The jumping drop motion has been tentatively explained as an outcome of melting and refreezing of the materials surface beneath the droplets and can be thus considered as an inverted Leidenfrost-like effect (in the classical case vapor is generated from a droplet on a hot substrate). We present here a detailed investigation of jumping movements using high-speed imaging and static cross-sectional cryogenic focused ion beam scanning electron microscope imaging. Our results show that drop motion is induced by a thermocapillary (Marangoni) effect. The in-plane jumping motion can be delineated to occur in two stages. The first stage occurs on a millisecond time scale and comprises melting the substrate due to drop condensation. This results in droplet depinning, partial spreading, and thermocapillary movement until freezing of the cyclohexane film. The second stage occurs on a second time scale and comprises relaxation motion of the drop contact line (change in drop contact radius and contact angle) after substrate freezing. When the cyclohexane film cannot freeze, the droplet continuously glides on the surface, resulting in the crawling motion.  aPublisher supplied data 3abenzene 3acontact angle 3acyclohexanes 3adroplets 3afreezing 3aimage analysis 3amelting 3amelting point 3ascanning electron microscopes 3avapors1 aAnand, Sushant1 aRykaczewski, Konrad1 aMedici, Marie-Gabrielle1 aGonzález-Viñas, Wenceslao1 aVaranasi, Kripa K.1 aBeysens, D.,0 tLangmuir.g2015 May 19, v. 31, no. 19 p.5353-5363dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-58277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fla504850x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02902naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002500147245008800172300001400260500001500274520148600289592002801775650002001803650001501823650002501838650001401863650001201877650001301889650001101902650001801913650001201931650001901943650002101962650001601983650001301999650001102012650002602023650001002049650001302059650002102072651001102093653001402104653002002118653002002138653002502158700003202183773011202215856004802327852000902375655001202384IND50086814920221121004334.0140412e20110101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5008681492DNAL7 a10.1080/090647109034337852doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDamalas, Christos A.10aWinter barley performance on two different soils under conservation tillage systems  ap. 33-38.  a2019-12-05  aConservation tillage is becoming increasingly attractive to farmers due its potential to reduce production costs and allow a more sustainable land use as compared with conventional tillage. Field experiments were conducted over three consecutive growing seasons to study barley performance under three tillage systems (minimum, reduced, and conventional tillage) on two different soils (a sandy loam and a clay soil) of northern Greece. No significant differences in plant number, ear number, or grain yield were observed among tillage systems in any growing season in the sandy loam soil. By contrast, reduced plant number by 15 and 18% in the first growing season and by 18 and 21% in the third growing season was observed for the reduced and the minimum tillage system, respectively, in the clay soil as compared with conventional tillage. Reduced plant number in the clay soil was due to the unfavorable soil conditions during sowing and the uneven seedbed as a result of the presence of summer weeds which apparently prevented correct and uniform planting depth. However, no significant differences in ear number or barley grain yield were found among tillage systems in any growing season in the clay soil. Findings of this study showed that conservation tillage can affect the establishment of barley stands depending on soil type and weather conditions but this is not always expressed in grain-yield reduction due to the effect of compensation through increased tillering.  aPublisher supplied data 3aminimum tillage 3aclay soils 3aconventional tillage 3atillering 3afarmers 3aseedbeds 3asowing 3awinter barley 3aweather 3agrowing season 3aproduction costs 3agrain yield 3aplanting 3asummer 3afield experimentation 3aweeds 3aland use 3asandy loam soils 3aGreece 0aClay soil 0areduced tillage 0asandy loam soil 0aconservation tillage1 aLithourgidis, Anastasios S.0 tActa agriculturæ Scandinavica.g2011 Jan. 1, v. 61, no. 1 p.33-38dTaylor & Francis Groupx1651-19137nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09064710903433785  aDNAL 7aarticle02734naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001400140245004100154300001800195520156300213592002801776650002301804650002301827650001101850650002801861650002001889650001701909650001601926650001801942650001401960650001401974650002601988700002002014700001302034700001502047700001202062700001802074700001602092773012102108856007402229852000902303655001202312IND60664189920221118021008.0190910e20130121xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066418992DNAL7 a10.1039/c2ra22171c2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYan, Hong10aPhotothermal-responsive [2]rotaxanes  ap. 2341-2350.  aThree photothermal-responsive α-cyclodextrin-based [2]rotaxanes were prepared via the copper(i)-catalyzed azide–alkyne cycloaddition, in which the α-cyclodextrin ring was threaded onto the azobenzene dumbbell component. The difference between the three [2]rotaxanes are the length of the ethylene glycol repeating chains connected between the azobenzene and triazole units in the dumbbell components. The α-cyclodextrin rings in the [2]rotaxanes can be reversibly switched between the azobenzene unit and triazole/ethylene glycol unit driven by the trans–cis isomerization of the azobenzene unit. The trans-to-cis isomerization of the azobenzene unit under UV light irradiation (365 nm) leads the α-cyclodextrin ring moving to the triazole/ethylene glycol unit, while the cis-to-trans isomerization of the azobenzene unit under either visible light irradiation or heating enables the α-cyclodextrin ring shuttling back to the azobenzene station. The different ethylene glycol repeating chains in the [2]rotaxanes can affect (1) the isomerization rates of the azobenzene units, i.e. the longer the chain, the faster the isomerization rate, and (2) fluorescent quantum yields of the [2]rotaxanes, i.e. the longer the chain, the lower the fluorescent quantum yield. In addition, the quantum yields of the [2]rotaxanes were enhanced by UV light irradiation and decreased back upon visible light irradiation or heating at 65 °C. The current research provides a fundamental understanding of the working mechanism for photothermal-responsive [2]rotaxanes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalpha-cyclodextrin 3acatalytic activity 3acopper 3acycloaddition reactions 3aethylene glycol 3afluorescence 3airradiation 3aisomerization 3arotaxanes 3atriazoles 3aultraviolet radiation1 aZhu, Liangliang1 aLi, Xing1 aKwok, Anna1 aLi, Xin1 aÅgren, Hans,1 aZhao, Yanli0 tRSC advances.g2013 Jan. 21, v. 3, no. 7 p.2341-2350dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c2ra22171c3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02479naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002100148245011300169300001600282520113500298592002801433650002601461650001401487650001501501650001601516650001601532650001601548650001501564650001901579650002101598650001201619650001201631650001901643650001401662650002601676653000901702653001601711653002201727653001901749653002301768700001801791773012101809856008201930852000902012655001202021IND60089838820221119202224.0160728e20131213xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008983882DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbrc.2013.04.1052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKaneta, Yasuyuki10aNEK9 depletion induces catastrophic mitosis by impairment of mitotic checkpoint control and spindle dynamics  ap. 139-146.  aNEK9 is known to play a role in spindle assembly and in the control of centrosome separation, but the consequences of NEK9 targeting in cancer cells remain to be elucidated. In this study, we used siRNA to investigate the consequences of targeting NEK9 in glioblastoma and kidney cancer cells as a first step in assessing its potential as an anti-cancer therapeutic target. Live cell imaging revealed that NEK9 depletion of U1242 glioblastoma and Caki2 kidney carcinoma cells resulted in failure of cytokinesis. Interestingly, NEK9-depleted Caki2 cells overrode mitosis under incorrect chromosome alignment and were converted to a micronucleated phenotype, leading to cell death. Whereas, the RPE1 normal epithelium cell line was refractory to abnormal mitosis upon NEK9 knockdown. Nocodazole-induced mitotic arrest was compromised after NEK9 depletion, indicating that NEK9 has an important role in mitotic checkpoint system. Taken together, we propose that NEK9 inhibition represents a novel anti-cancer strategy by induction of mitotic catastrophe via impairment of spindle dynamics, cytokinesis and mitotic checkpoint control.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantineoplastic agents 3acarcinoma 3acell death 3acentrosomes 3achromosomes 3acytokinesis 3aepithelium 3aimage analysis 3akidney neoplasms 3akidneys 3amitosis 3aneoplasm cells 3aphenotype 3asmall interfering RNA 0aNEK9 0aCytokinesis 0aCheckpoint system 0aMitotic arrest 0aTherapeutic target1 aUllrich, Axel0 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2013 Dec. 13, v. 442 p.139-146dElsevier Inc.x0006-291X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2013.04.1053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01674naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094024002200122024001900144040001800163100002400181245006200205300001800267506007600285520037700361592002800738506003700766650000800803650002300811650002300834650002500857650001300882700002200895700001900917700002400936700002000960700002400980700002101004700002301025773013301048856007401181852000901255655001201264IND60639090320221207145111.0190501e20170309xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063909032DNAL7 a10.1039/c7cc00288b2doi7 aPMC53585002pmcid7 a282436612pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFlynn, Gabriella E.10aReversible DNA micro-patterning using the fluorous effect  ap. 3094-3097.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aWe describe a new method for the immobilisation of DNA into defined patterns with sub-micron resolution, using the fluorous effect.

The aim of this study was to determine whether the consumption of a dairy product fortified with iron and vitamin D, compared to the equivalent with only added iron, exerts an additional effect on iron metabolism in iron-deficient menstruating women. Methods: The design was a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, parallel-group trial of 16 weeks’ duration. Subjects were randomized into 2 groups that consumed, as part of their usual diet, 500 mL/day of an iron (n = 54) or iron- and vitamin D–fortified (n = 55) flavored skim milk. At baseline and monthly, dietary intake, body weight, and hematological and iron metabolism biomarkers were determined. Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D was analyzed at baseline and weeks 8 and 16. Data were analyzed by analysis of variance (ANOVA) of repeated measures for time and Time×Group interaction effects. Results: A total of 109 volunteers completed the study. Calcium and iron intakes increased during the intervention (p < 0.001 for both groups). Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D significantly increased in Fe + D group during the assay (p < 0.001) and at week 16 it was higher compared to the Fe group (p < 0.05). Serum ferritin, serum transferrin, mean corpuscular volume, mean corpuscular hemoglobin, and red blood cell distribution width showed significant time effects but no Time×Group interaction. Higher values of erythrocytes (p = 0.01), hematocrit (p = 0.05), and hemoglobin (p = 0.03) at week 8 were observed in the Fe + D group compared to the Fe group. Conclusion: Iron-fortified flavored skim milk does not improve iron status in iron-deficient menstruating women. However, vitamin D fortification slightly enhances erythropoiesis and iron status.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanalysis of variance 3abiomarkers 3ablood serum 3abody weight 3acalcium 3adairy consumption 3aerythrocytes 3aerythropoiesis 3aferritin 3afortified foods 3ahematocrit 3ahemoglobin 3airon 3airon absorption 3airon deficiency anemia 3arandomized clinical trials 3askim milk 3atransferrin 3avitamin D 3avitamin D deficiency 3avolunteers 3awomen 0avitamin D 0aferric pyrophosphate 0afortification 0askim milk 0airon deficiency 0awomen1 aPérez-Granados, Ana M.1 aBlanco-Rojo, Ruth1 aWright, Ione1 aGonzález-Vizcayno, Carmen1 aVaquero, M.

The generation of phytosanitary knowledge regarding nematodes is an immediate demand, considering the increase in the production of food and the scarcity of information about the causative agents of diseases in the culture (Gusso et al. 2015; Oliveira et al. 2013). In Brazil, two important pathogens have been reported on yacon: the fungus Fusarium oxysporum (Moraes et al. 2017) and the root-knot nematode (RKN) Meloidogyne ethiopica (Carneiro and Almeida 2005). Plants randomly collected from commercial farms located in the district of Alto Norte, Muniz Freire, Espírito Santo, Brazil (20°14′39.0″S, 41°24′43.1″W), distributed in the field at a regular dispersion gradient, showed uniformly intense leaf yellowing (leaf chlorosis) symptoms, distributed on the leaf surface, especially in the lower leaves, small size (dwarfism), wilting at the hottest hours of the day, and galls throughout the plant root system. Phytonematodes were identified parasitizing absorption roots, tuberous roots, and rhizophores of S. sonchifolius. With the main purpose of multiplication the RKN species, 12 egg masses were individually collected from the absorption roots, tuberous roots, and rhizophores of S. sonchifolius and macerated in Eppendorf tubes (5 ml) containing distilled sterilized water and were inoculated in 12 tomato seedlings (Solanum lycopersicum ‘Santa Clara’) kept in pots containing a sterile mixture of soil, sand, and manure in a ratio of 2:1:1. The pots with tomato seedlings were kept in a greenhouse for 60 days under the same conditions of soil (a sterile mixture), temperature (28 ± 5°C), and humidity. With the main purpose extraction of the RKN species and reproduction of the symptoms observed in the field, 12 egg masses were individually collected from the tomato roots and macerated in Eppendorf tubes (5 ml) containing distilled sterilized water and were inoculated in 12 absorption roots and tuberous roots of S. sonchifolius kept in pots containing a sterile mixture of soil, sand, and manure in a ratio of 2:1:1. The pots with S. sonchifolius seedlings were kept in a greenhouse for 60 days under the same conditions of soil (a sterile mixture), temperature (28 ± 5°C), and humidity to reproduce the symptoms observed in the field, fulfilling Koch’s postulates. The final population density (Pf) of phytonematodes was quantified, being higher than the initial population density (Pi – inoculated). Only the inoculated plants showed the same typical symptoms observed in S. sonchifolius plants collected in the field. The biochemical technique of isoenzyme electrophoresis was used for the identification (Carneiro and Almeida 2001). Eight young females extracted from infected yacon potato roots were macerated in Eppendorf tubes (5 ml) containing distilled sterilized water, and a species-specific enzyme phenotype I3 (Rm: 0.8, 1.1, 1.25) was identified, corresponding to M. inornata recently considered as a species belonging to M. ethiopica group (Gerič Stare et al. 2019). A protein extract of M. javanica was included as a reference. It is concluded, therefore, that the causal agent of the observed field symptoms in the Alto Norte district, Muniz Freire, Espírito Santo, Brazil, is due to M. inornata parasitism. This is the first report of M. inornata officially diagnosed causing damage to commercial production of S. sonchifolius in Brazil.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFusarium oxysporum 3aMeloidogyne ethiopica 3aMeloidogyne javanica 3aSmallanthus sonchifolius 3aSolanum lycopersicum 3aSolanum tuberosum 3achlorosis 3acommercial farms 3acrop production 3adwarfing 3aegg masses 3aelectrophoresis 3afemales 3afungi 3agalls 3agreenhouses 3ahumidity 3aisozymes 3aleaves 3aparasitism 3apathogens 3aphenotype 3apopulation density 3apotatoes 3aroot systems 3aroot-knot nematodes 3aroots 3asand 3aseedlings 3asoil 3atemperature 3atomatoes 3awilting 3aBrazil 0ayacon potato 0adiagnosis1 aCarvalho, A.

Clinical examination revealed disproportional dwarfism with mild skeletal abnormalities and a palpable thyroid gland. The presumptive diagnosis of congenital hypothyroidism was confirmed by low serum total thyroxine (tT₄) concentration prior to and after the administration of thyroid stimulation hormone (TSH), increased endogenous TSH concentration and abnormal thyroid scintigraphic scan. The kitten had abnormal liver function tests and decreased insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) concentration, both of which returned to normal in correspondence with an improvement of the clinical signs after 6 weeks of thyroxine therapy. Congenital hypothyroidism is a rare disease that may present with considerable variation in clinical manifestation. In cases in which clinical signs are ambiguous, disorders such as portosystemic shunt and hyposomatotropism have to be taken into account as differential diagnosis. As hypothyroidism may be associated with abnormal liver function tests and low IGF-1 concentrations, test results have to be interpreted carefully.  aPublisher supplied data 3aliver function 3ainsulin-like growth factor I 3adwarfing 3adiagnostic techniques 3akittens 3adrug therapy 3aconstipation 3athyroxine 3agrowth disorders 3acongenital abnormalities 3acase studies 3athyroid gland 3athyroid hormones 3acat diseases 3ahypothyroidism 3asigns and symptoms (animals and humans) 3adisease diagnosis 2aAnimals 2aCat Diseasesxcongenitalxdiagnosisxdrug therapy. 2aCats 2aCongenital Hypothyroidismxdiagnosisxdrug therapyxveterinary. 2aDiagnosis, Differential 2aInsulin-Like Growth Factor Ixanalysis 2aLiver Function Testsxveterinary 2aMale 2aThyrotropinxbloodxdiagnostic use. 2aThyroxinexblood 0aSwitzerland 0acomplications1 aFracassi, Federico1 aGorgas, Daniela1 aKircher, Patrick R.1 aBoretti, Felicitas S.1 aOhlerth, Stefanie1 aReusch, Claudia E.0 tJournal of feline medicine and surgery.g, v. 12, no. 6 p.487-490dSAGE PublicationswJournal:jnl58542x1098-612X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jfms.2010.01.0133Available from publisher's site 7aarticle02595naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245011500168500001900283520121600302592002801518650002601546650001801572650001501590650001101605650002601616650001101642650001301653650001101666650001801677650001901695653000801714653003201722653001901754653002501773653001901798700001601817700005801833700002301891700001901914700002001933773009001953856008502043852000902128655001202137IND60720596420221119070037.0210121e20210301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072059642DNAL7 a10.1016/j.energy.2020.1195482doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Haiming10aEffective H2S control during chemical looping combustion by iron ore modified with alkaline earth metal oxides  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aIron ore (IO) modified with alkaline earth metal (AEM) oxides were developed as oxygen carriers (OCs) for the chemical looping combustion (CLC) of simulated municipal solid waste (MSW) syngas to simultaneously reduce the H₂S emission. The AEM oxides, especially BaO, were found to improve the CLC performance of IO greatly due to the formation of AEM ferrites, which promoted the lattice oxygen activity. When using the pristine IO, less than 10% of the input H₂S could be removed with the remaining being released from the reactor mainly in the form of SO₂. The loadings of CaO and MgO were also found to be ineffective in sulfur removal from the syngas, because the sulfur fixation reactions were kinetically and thermodynamically limited for CaO and MgO, respectively. By contrast, over 60% of the input H₂S was effectively retained on the BaO-loaded OC in the form of sulfates/sulfites because of the high reactivity between BaCO₃ and H₂S in the presence of Fe₂O₃. This study indicates that the IO loaded with BaO showed superior performance both in CLC of syngas and control of sulfur species, which can be used in the CLC of sulfur containing fuels to realize a cleaner combustion process.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalkaline earth metals 3acalcium oxide 3acombustion 3aenergy 3amunicipal solid waste 3aoxygen 3asulfites 3asulfur 3asynthesis gas 3athermodynamics 0aH2S 0aChemical looping combustion 0aOxygen carrier 0aAlkaline earth metal 0aSulfur removal1 aLiu, Guicai1 aVeksha, Andrei1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4647-03421 aGiannis, Apostolos1 aLim, Teik-Thye1 aLisak, Grzegorz0 tEnergy.g2021 Mar. 01, v. 218 p.119548-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12436x0360-54427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2020.1195483Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03558naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094024002200132024001900154040001800173100001800191245011000209300001600319506007600335520187900411592002802290506003702318650001102355650001502366650002102381650002302402650001602425650001802441650002002459650002102479650002102500650002102521650001402542650001302556650001202569650001002581650001602591650001302607651001602620653001902636653001802655653002202673653001202695653001402707653001602721653001902737653001502756773012802771856008402899852000902983655001202992IND60123286720221207112912.0150325e20131001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012328672DNAL7 a10.1080/07315724.2013.8399072doi7 aPMC38564712pmcid7 a242193762pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aUdani, Jay K.10aImmunomodulatory Effects of ResistAid™: A Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled, Multidose Study  ap. 331-338.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aObjective: To evaluate the ability of a proprietary arabinogalactan extract from the larch tree (ResistAid, Lonza Ltd., Basel, Switzerland) to change the immune response in healthy adults to a standardized antigenic challenge (tetanus and influenza vaccines) in a dose-dependent manner compared to placebo. Methods: This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial included 75 healthy adults (18–61 years old). Subjects were randomized to receive either 1.5 or 4.5 g/day of ResistAid or placebo for 60 days. At day 30, subjects were administered both tetanus and influenza vaccines. Serum antigenic response (tetanus immunoglobulin G [IgG], influenza A and B IgG and immunoglobulin M [IgM]) was measured at days 45 (15 days after vaccination) and 60 (30 days after vaccination) of the study and compared to baseline antibody levels. Frequency and intensity of adverse events were monitored throughout the study. Results: As expected, all 3 groups demonstrated an expected rise in tetanus IgG levels 15 and 30 days following the vaccine. There was a strongly significant difference in the rise in IgG levels at day 60 in the 1.5 g/day group compared to placebo (p = 0.008). In the 4.5 g/day group, there was significant rise in tetanus IgG at days 45 and 60 compared to baseline (p < 0.01) but these values were not significant compared to placebo. Neither group demonstrated any significant elevations in IgM or IgG antibodies compared to placebo following the influenza vaccine. There were no clinically or statistically significant or serious adverse events. Conclusions: ResistAid at a dose of 1.5 g/day significantly increased the IgG antibody response to tetanus vaccine compared to placebo. In conjunction with earlier studies, this validates the effect of ResistAid on the augmentation of the response to bacterial antigens (in the form of vaccine).  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aadults 3aantibodies 3aarabinogalactans 3abacterial antigens 3ablood serum 3adose response 3aimmune response 3aimmunoglobulin G 3aimmunoglobulin M 3aimmunomodulation 3ainfluenza 3aplacebos 3atetanus 3atrees 3avaccination 3avaccines 3aSwitzerland 0aClinical trial 0aimmune system 0aadaptive immunity 0atetanus 0ainfluenza 0avaccination 0aLarix laricina 0alarch tree0 tJournal of the American College of Nutrition.g2013 Oct. 1, v. 32, no. 5 p.331-338dTaylor & Francis Groupx1541-10877nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/07315724.2013.8399073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02869naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001400150245013700164300001600301520148500317592002801802650002501830650001501855650001201870650002601882650001301908650001701921650001901938650001301957650003301970650002102003653001602024653002402040653003502064653003202099653001702131700001902148700002802167700003602195773011102231856008402342852000902426655001202435IND60633899120221120195046.0190321e20190515xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063389912DNAL7 a10.1016/j.memsci.2018.09.0702doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXu, Li Li10aFlexible electro-responsive in-situ polymer acid doped polyaniline membranes for permeation enhancement and membrane fouling removal  ap. 263-272.  aThis study investigates the performance of a new electrically tuneable polyaniline (PANI) membrane, and shows that this synthesis method has the potential to address key challenges of small-acid doped PANI membranes, including: acid dopants leaching out during filtration and low mechanical strength. The novel in-situ polymerisation used poly (2-acrylamido-2-methyl-1-propanesulfonic acid) (PAMPSA), as polymer acid template leads to the formation of inter-polymer complexes of PANI and polymer acid. The developed membranes were comprehensibly evaluated through visual, chemical, mechanical and filtration studies and compared to small-acid doped membranes (PANI-HCl membranes). The PANI-PAMPSA membranes were smooth, acid leach resistant, had higher tensile strength and showed conductivity three magnitudes higher compared to PANI membrane with post cast doping. The developed membrane showed in-filtration performance stability, electrical tuneability (in-situ control of flux and rejection) and fouling removal characteristics under applied electrical potential. Data obtained by SEM, IR spectroscopy, electrical analysis and cross-flow filtration confirm these results. The overall results showed that the proposed membrane fabrication procedure resulted in a significant improvement in performance across a range of critical parameters, including conductivity, stability, flexibility, permeance and fouling removal with additional advantage of being electrically tuneable.  aPublisher supplied data 3aartificial membranes 3afiltration 3afouling 3ainfrared spectroscopy 3aleaching 3apermeability 3apolymerization 3apolymers 3ascanning electron microscopy 3atensile strength 0aPolyaniline 0aPolymer acid dopant 0aElectrically tuneable membrane 0aStimuli responsive membrane 0aAnti-fouling1 aShahid, Salman1 aPatterson, Darrell Alec1 aEmanuelsson, Emma Anna Carolina0 tJournal of membrane science.g2019 May 15, v. 578 p.263-272dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12468x0376-73887nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.memsci.2018.09.0703Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03001naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001600148245019300164520178900357592002802146650001802174650002402192650001802216650000902234650002202243653000902265653002402274653002402298653001102322653000902333700005702342700005702399773010302456856008302559852000902642655001202651IND60738584920221116140447.0210904e202109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073858492DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tvjl.2021.1056952doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTatum, R.C.10aEvaluation of the sensitivity and specificity of basal plasma adrenocorticotrophic hormone concentration for diagnosing pituitary pars intermedia dysfunction in horses: A systematic review  aMeasurement of basal adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH) is currently used to diagnose pituitary pars intermedia dysfunction (PPID) in horses, yet a systematic review of the evidence for its use has not been undertaken. This study aimed to systematically review evidence regarding the sensitivity and specificity of the basal ACTH diagnostic test. Electronic databases were systematically searched in January 2019, September 2020 and January 2021, for English language publications published prior to these dates. Screening, data extraction and quality assessment of publications was undertaken by the authors using predefined criteria. Study design, methodology and information reported in included studies were assessed using Standards for Reporting of Diagnostic Accuracy (STARD) checklists. Risk of bias and applicability were appraised using the Quality Assessment tool for Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (QUADAS-2) quality assessment tool. Due to identified biases and marked between-study variations, meta-analysis was not undertaken.After removal of duplicates, 415 publications were identified, of which 25 were evaluated in full, with 11 of these meeting inclusion criteria. In most studies, basal ACTH was reported to have good sensitivity (overall median 75.5%; interquartile range [IQR], 64.0−86.5%; range, 36.0−100%) and excellent specificity (overall median, 95.2%; IQR, 84.2−98.9%; range, 63.3−100%). However, QUADAS-2 and STARD assessment highlighted that studies did not utilise optimal study design and/or study populations for the evaluation of a diagnostic test and the majority were subject to bias, or provided insufficient information to fully assess possible biases. Based on this review, basal ACTH performed better at ruling out PPID than detecting it.  aPublisher supplied data 3acorticotropin 3aexperimental design 3ameta-analysis 3arisk 3asystematic review 0aACTH 0aCushing’s disease 0aDiagnostic accuracy 0aEquine 0aPPID1 aMcGowan, C.M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1946-95841 aIreland, J.L.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5737-15020 tveterinary journal.g2021 Sept., v. 275 p.105695-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl55231x1090-02337nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tvjl.2021.1056953Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02817naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002600150245012700176500001900303520133200322592002801654650002101682650001401703650001601717650001401733650001101747650003101758650001301789650002401802650001501826650001701841650000901858653001801867653002201885653003201907653002601939653001801965700002201983700002102005700001502026700002102041700003202062700002502094700002002119773009002139856008502229852000902314655001202323IND60720596620221119065733.0210121e20210301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072059662DNAL7 a10.1016/j.energy.2020.1195512doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEttefaghi, Ehsanollah10aBio-nano emulsion fuel based on graphene quantum dot nanoparticles for reducing energy consumption and pollutants emission  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aIn this research, for the first time a mixture of diesel-biodiesel-water-bionanoparticles was prepared to simultaneously optimize the fuel consumption, reduce pollutant emission, and enhance the performance of diesel engines. To this end, graphene quantum dots as biodegradable nanoparticles were synthesized through the hydrothermal method. In this respective, the synthesized quantum dot nanoparticles were added at the concentrations of 20, 60, and 100 ppm along with 1, 5, and 10 vol% distilled water to the B15 fuel (the diesel fuel containing 15 vol% biodiesel). The results obtained from the engine experiments exhibited that when water and quantum dots were added simultaneously to the B15 fuel, the engine power was increased and the brake specific fuel consumption was reduced. In addition, the emissions of pollutants including HC, NOx and soot were decreased. However, the soot emission was slightly increased by adding the nanoparticles. For the sample containing 5% water and 60 ppm graphene quantum dot nanoparticles, the engine power was improved by 13.6% and the brake specific fuel consumption was reduced by 7.8% compared to those of the B15 pure fuel. Furthermore, emissions of pollutants including NOx, HC, and soot were decreased by 3.8, 29.2, and 33.7%, respectively, compared with the B15 pure fuel.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiodegradability 3abiodiesel 3adiesel fuel 3aemulsions 3aenergy 3aenergy use and consumption 3agraphene 3ahot water treatment 3apollutants 3aquantum dots 3asoot 0aDiesel engine 0aExhaust emissions 0aBiodegradable nanoparticles 0aGraphene quantum dots 0aEmulsion fuel1 aRashidi, Alimorad1 aGhobadian, Barat1 aNajafi, G.1 aGhasemy, Ebrahim1 aKhoshtaghaza, Mohammad Hadi1 aDelavarizadeh, Saman1 aMazlan, Mohamed0 tEnergy.g2021 Mar. 01, v. 218 p.119551-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12436x0360-54427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2020.1195513Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02662naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002000139245014800159300001600307520148500323592002801808650002701836650001101863650001501874650002401889650002401913650001301937650003701950700002001987700001502007700002202022700002302044700001802067700002302085773009602108856007502204852000902279655001202288IND60577244520221120164309.0170807e20150120xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057724452DNAL7 a10.1021/la503267k2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBello, Gianluca10aCharacterization of the Aggregates Formed by Various Bacterial Lipopolysaccharides in Solution and upon Interaction with Antimicrobial Peptides  ap. 741-751.  aThe biophysical analysis of the aggregates formed by different chemotypes of bacterial lipopolysaccharides (LPS) before and after challenge by two different antiendotoxic antimicrobial peptides (LL37 and bovine lactoferricin) was performed in order to determine their effect on the morphology of LPS aggregates. Small-angle neutron scattering (SANS) and cryogenic transmission electron microscopy (cryoTEM) were used to examine the structures formed by both smooth and rough LPS chemotypes and the effect of the peptides, by visualization of the aggregates and analysis of the scattering data by means of both mathematical approximations and defined models. The data showed that the structure of LPS determines the morphology of the aggregates and influences the binding activity of both peptides. The morphologies of the worm-like micellar aggregates formed by the smooth LPS were relatively unaltered by the presence of the peptides due to their pre-existing high degree of positive curvature being little affected by their association with either peptide. On the other hand, the aggregates formed by the rough LPS chemotypes showed marked morphological changes from lamellar structures to ordered micellar networks, induced by the increase in positive curvature engendered upon association with the peptides. The combined use of cryoTEM and SANS proved to be a very useful tool for studying the aggregation properties of LPS in solution at biologically relevant concentrations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantimicrobial peptides 3acattle 3achemotypes 3alipopolysaccharides 3amathematical models 3aneutrons 3atransmission electron microscopy1 aEriksson, Jonny1 aTerry, Ann1 aEdwards, Katarina1 aLawrence, M.

However, climate change is projected to result in milder winters, which may enable cultivation of winter crops to a greater extent in the future than is possible today. In this study we aimed at identifying main temperature, precipitation events and characteristics that have resulted in past poor overwintering of rye and wheat in their current production areas in Finland. Using long-term (1970–2006), multi-location datasets, we compared our findings with the projected major changes attributable to climate change. Mixed models were used to estimate mutually comparable overwintering damage to all experiments and logistic regression was used to determine whether climatic parameters are related to high levels of overwintering damage. Severity of overwintering damage, and associated yield penalties, fluctuate considerably on a year-to-year basis and no consistent reduction in variability was recorded during the study period. Particularly for wheat, severity of winter damage in any one year was associated negatively with area sown in the following year. There was no evidence of consistent genetic improvements in winter hardiness, but rye was more winter hardy than wheat. Current risks associated with rye production related to low temperatures could be alleviated in the future, although overwintering damage currently enhanced by high autumn precipitation could increase due to climate change. For wheat, fluctuating conditions hampered overwintering, which may be an even harder challenge in future when weather variation is projected to increase and extreme weather events are projected to become more common.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSecale cereale 3aTriticum aestivum 3aautumn 3aclimate change 3acrop production 3adata collection 3agenetic improvement 3agrain crops 3amodels 3aoverwintering 3aregression analysis 3arisk 3arye 3atemperature 3aweather 3awheat 3awinter hardiness 3aFinland 0aAutumn 0aclimatic conditions 0afluctuation 0afrost 0aprecipitation 0aspring 0atemperature 0awinter 0awinter cereals 0awinter damage1 aHakala, Kaija1 aJauhiainen, Lauri0 tActa agriculturæ Scandinavica.g2011 Jan. 1, v. 61, no. 1 p.75-83dTaylor & Francis Groupx1651-19137nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09064710903535977  aDNAL 7aarticle04450naa a2200697 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100001800188245013100206300001100337506007600348520228700424592002802711596005902739596007702798506003702875650001502912650001802927650001202945650001202957650002202969650001402991650001403005650002203019650002803041650002203069650001603091650002503107650001703132650003103149650002403180650001003204650001803214650001203232650001503244650001203259650001103271650002203282650002003304650001903324650001903343650001803362650002003380650002203400650001803422650001403440700001603454700001503470700001303485700001603498700001703514773011803531856008203649852000903731655001203740IND60635557820221207120214.0200304e201912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063555782DNAL7 a10.1186/s13068-019-1406-y2doi7 aPMC64424042pmcid7 a309763252pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLuo, Chaobing10aDegradation of bamboo lignocellulose by bamboo snout beetle Cyrtotrachelus buqueti in vivo and vitro: efficiency and mechanism  ap. 75.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: As an important biomass raw material, the lignocellulose in bamboo is of significant value in energy conversion. The conversion of bamboo lignocellulose into fermentable reducing sugar, i.e. the degradation of bamboo lignocellulose, is an important step in lignocellulose conversion. However, little research has focussed on excavating the enzymes and microbes that are related to the degradation of bamboo lignocellulose, which is important for its utilisation. This study used Cyrtotrachelus buqueti (bamboo snout beetle) to evaluate the efficiency of bamboo lignocellulose degradation. RESULTS: RNA sequencing was conducted to sequence the transcriptome of the insect before and after feeding on bamboo shoots. The expression levels of genes encoding several carbohydrate-active enzymes, such as endoglucanase (evgtrinloc27093t1 and evgtrinloc16407t0) and laccase (evgtrinloc15173t0 and evgtrinloc11252t0), were found to be upregulated after feeding. Faecal component analysis showed that the degradation efficiencies of cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin were 61.82%, 87.65% and 69.05%, respectively. After 6 days of co-culture with crude enzymes in vitro, the degradation efficiencies of cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin in bamboo shoot particles (BSPs) were 24.98%, 37.52% and 26.67%, respectively. These results indicated that lignocellulosic enzymes and related enzymes within the insect itself co-degraded bamboo lignocellulose. These finding can potentially be used for the pre-treatment and enzymatic hydrolysis of bamboo lignocellulose. CONCLUSION: Our results showed that intestinal digestive enzymes from C. buqueti degraded bamboo shoot lignocellulose both in vivo and in vitro. In addition, the expression levels of many carbohydrate-active enzyme (CAZyme) genes were upregulated in the transcriptome, including those for cellulase, xylanase and ligninase genes. Therefore, we proposed a scheme for applying the lignocellulolytic enzymes from C. buqueti to degrade bamboo lignocellulose using genetic, enzymatic and fermentation engineering techniques to overexpress the lignocellulolytic enzymes genes in vitro and obtain large quantities of enzymes that could efficiently degrade bamboo lignocellulose and be used for lignocellulose bioconversion.  aPublisher supplied data  a31470655cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a18ZA0246cKey Fund Project of Sichuan Provincial Department of Education0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aColeoptera 3abamboo shoots 3abamboos 3abiomass 3abiotransformation 3acellulose 3acoculture 3adigestive enzymes 3aendo-1,4-beta-glucanase 3aenergy conversion 3aengineering 3aenzymatic hydrolysis 3afermentation 3agene expression regulation 3agene overexpression 3agenes 3ahemicellulose 3ainsects 3aintestines 3alaccase 3alignin 3alignin peroxidase 3alignocellulases 3alignocellulose 3amicroorganisms 3araw materials 3areducing sugars 3asequence analysis 3atranscriptome 3axylanases1 aLi, Yuanqiu1 aChen, Ying1 aFu, Chun1 aNong, Xiang1 aYang, Yaojun0 tBiotechnology for biofuels.g2019 Dec., v. 12, no. 1 p.75-75dBioMed CentralwJournal:jnl4350543x1754-68347nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13068-019-1406-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03194naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002100152245011800173506011700291506007600408520134600484592002801830506003701858650001801895650003001913650001201943650001901955650001901974650001501993650001702008650002202025650002502047650001902072650001702091650001302108650002602121650001202147650002002159650002902179653002102208653001902229653001202248653002102260653000902281653001102290700002102301700002202322700001802344700003102362700002202393773011702415856008702532852000902619655001202628IND60779777620221207062508.0220914e20220901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077977762DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enconman.2022.1158662doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNavajas, Alberto10aLife cycle assessment of power-to-methane systems with CO2 supplied by the chemical looping combustion of biomass  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aPower-to-methane (PtM) systems may allow fluctuations in the renewable energy supply to be smoothed out by storing surplus energy in the form of methane. These systems work by combining the hydrogen produced by electrolysis with carbon dioxide from different sources to produce methane via the Sabatier reaction. The present work studies PtM systems based on the CO₂ supplied by the chemical looping combustion (CLC) of biomass (PtM-bioCLC). Life- cycle- assessment (LCA) was performed on PtM-bioCLC systems to evaluate their environmental impact with respect to a specific reference case. The proposed configurations have the potential to reduce the value of the global warming potential (GWP) climate change indicator to the lowest values reported in the literature to date. Moreover, the possibility of effectively removing CO₂ from the atmosphere through the concept of CO₂ negative emissions was also assessed. In addition to GWP, as many as 16 LCA indicators were also evaluated and their values for the studied PtM-bioCLC systems were found to be similar to those of the reference case considered or even significantly lower in such categories as resource use-depletion, ozone depletion, human health, acidification potential and eutrophication. The results obtained highlight the potential of these newly proposed PtM schemes.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aacidification 3aadministrative management 3abiomass 3acarbon dioxide 3aclimate change 3acombustion 3aelectrolysis 3aenergy conversion 3aenvironmental impact 3aeutrophication 3ahuman health 3ahydrogen 3alife cycle assessment 3amethane 3aozone depletion 3arenewable energy sources 0aPower-to-methane 0aCarbon capture 0aBiomass 0aChemical looping 0aCLOU 0aiG-CLC1 aMendiara, Teresa1 aGandía, Luis M.,1 aAbad, Alberto1 aGarcía-Labiano, Francisco1 ade Diego, Luis F.0 tEnergy conversion and management.g2022 Sept. 01, v. 267 p.115866-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11831x0196-89047nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enconman.2022.1158663Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02959naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245012300168300001600291520157000307592002801877650002501905650002101930650001701951650001801968650001801986650002602004650001102030650001402041650001202055650002102067650001402088650001302102650001602115650001902131653002402150653004802174653001902222653001902241700001802260700001702278773011202295856008502407852000902492655001202501IND60633899520221120195057.0190502e20190615xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063389952DNAL7 a10.1016/j.memsci.2019.03.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Xiaokang12aA modeling investigation on the thermal effect in osmosis with gap-filled vertically aligned carbon nanotube membranes  ap. 143-153.  aIn recent decades, various nanoporous materials have attracted extensive interest in separation processes including osmosis-related phenomena due to their high permeability and significant screening ability. Osmosis is a ubiquitous transmembrane process defined in isothermal conditions, and the influence of solution temperature on the mass transfer process has been reported. However, temperature gradient as a driving force does not receive enough attention. In this work, we model the coupled heat and mass transfer across a gap-filled vertically aligned carbon nanotube (VACNT) membrane, considering the boundary layers and thermo-osmotic theory. The results show that the spontaneous temperature difference due to the mass transfer is small, even if the flux is very large. Therefore, this effect may not be measurable in practical applications. Meanwhile, because solvent can be driven down the temperature gradient through carbon nanotubes, we discuss the influence of solution temperature on flux and the possibility of desalination by heating the high-concentration solution. The result suggests that the following conditions are favorable for the purpose: a large thermo-osmotic coefficient, a large equivalent thermal resistance, a large temperature difference and a small osmotic pressure difference across the membrane This effect is almost independent on the membrane permeability. This work may help to explore the applications of membranes in desalination and separation processes with thermo-osmotic effect and ubiquitous low-grade thermal energy.  aPublisher supplied data 3aartificial membranes 3acarbon nanotubes 3adesalination 3aheat transfer 3amass transfer 3amembrane permeability 3amodels 3ananopores 3aosmosis 3aosmotic pressure 3ascreening 3asolvents 3atemperature 3athermal energy 0aNanoporous material 0aVertically aligned carbon nanotube membrane 0aThermo-osmosis 0aThermal effect1 aShu, Liangsuo1 aJin, Shiping0 tJournal of membrane science.g2019 June 15, v. 580 p.143-153dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12468x0376-73887nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.memsci.2019.03.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04850naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245006900168300001600237520338800253592002803641650001503669650001203684650001003696650001303706650000903719650001503728650001103743650001503754650002703769650001103796650000903807650001503816650001403831650000903845650001103854650001003865650001403875650000803889650002203897653002003919653001903939653001703958653002803975653001804003700001704021700002204038700001904060700001704079773011004096856008104206852000904287655001204296IND60591633920221118012240.0190426e201712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059163392DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jef.2017.12.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChung, Hae-Kyung10aRecovering the royal cuisine in Chosun Dynasty and its esthetics  ap. 242-253.  aWe believe that researching the cuisine consumed by the royal family, in particular the king, during the 500-year long Chosun Dynasty is an interesting and meaningful endeavor. This task is an important part of unraveling the cultural significance of Korean cuisine in the 21st century, a new age of gastronomy. Until now, research has largely focused on recreating Chosun royal cuisine based on oral statements from staff in the last royal kitchen or the Uikwe (儀軌), the Royal Protocols which recorded food consumed at banquets. However, little research has been conducted on ordinary royal cuisine consumed by the king, mainly because of a lack of materials to study. This article aims to shed light on this topic and recreate what every day royal cuisine looked like in the late stages of the Chosun Dynasty by examining joseoksangsikbalgi (朝夕上食撥記, memos of morning and evening ancestral rites table) and judaryebalgi (晝茶禮撥記, memos of daytime tea ceremonies). The memos are similar to the chanpumdanja (饌品單子, literally meaning “a list of dishes served on the table”) that recorded national banquets and therefore do not contain records of ordinary royal cuisine. However, the memos of morning and evening ancestral rites table still remain. These documents describe food offered to the deceased, which was the same as the meals they regularly ate while alive. Accordingly, we attempted to reproduce the traditional table setting for ordinary royal cuisine served to King Kojong (高宗) by analyzing these memos. King Kojong (1852–1919) was the 26th king of the Chosun Dynasty, and a detailed description of the sangsik (上食, ancestral rites table) prepared following his death in January 1919 is present in the morning and evening sangsik memos and daytime tea ceremony memos from October 11, 1919. After analyzing the memos from after King Kojong's death in 1919, we were able to determine that the cuisine consisted of rice as bap (a main staple rice), kuk (a kind of soup), tang (stew), banchan (side dishes) such as meat, jeok (skewers), jeon (Korean pancakes), greens and salted dry fish, kimchi, seasonings such as soy sauce, kochujang (red pepper paste) and mustard as well as fruits and fruit salad for dessert. We determined that in addition to bap (rice), kuk (soup), tang (stew), kimchi and sauces, there were 7–9 banchan (side dishes) that served to create a balanced meal. On examination of the esthetic elements of Chosun royal cuisine, we found that the cuisine followed Confucian customs and formalities, and the kobaeumsik (고배음식, religious food serviced by layer upon layer) that symbolizes the power of the king. In addition to this, royal cuisine also embodied the philosophy of yaksikdongwon (藥食同源), an ideology which focuses on the health function of food. It was also nutritionally balanced and achieved synergy between yin (陰) and yang (陽). We believe that studying the cuisine of the Chosun royal family will ultimately play a role in spreading awareness about Korean royal cuisine around the world and creating materials that can be referred to for further research on royal cuisine and culture. However, we cannot be certain that the records present in the sangsik memos are truly representative of what the king ate on a daily basis, and more detailed analysis is required on this point.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaesthetics 3acuisine 3adeath 3adesserts 3afish 3aflavorings 3afruits 3agastronomy 3agreen leafy vegetables 3akimchi 3ameat 3aphilosophy 3aprotocols 3arice 3asalads 3asoups 3asoy sauce 3atea 3atraditional foods 0aAncestral table 0aChosun Dynasty 0aKorean foods 0aMemo for memorial foods 0aRoyal cuisine1 aShin, Dayeon1 aChung, Kyung Rhan1 aChoi, Soe Yeon1 aWoo, Nariyah0 tJournal of ethnic foods.g2017 Dec., v. 4, no. 4 p.242-253dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23306x2352-619X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jef.2017.12.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03592naa a2200637 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001700152245013300169520185000302592002802152650003002180650002302210650001702233650002202250650001602272650001802288650001702306650001102323650000902334650002702343650001902370650001402389653000902403653000902412653000802421653000902429653000702438653000702445653000902452653000802461653000802469653000802477653000802485653000902493653000702502653000802509653000702517653000802524653000702532653000702539653004302546653002302589653002902612653002002641653002602661653002302687700001902710773011702729856008702846852000902933655001202942IND60743735620221120125715.0210820e20210901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074373562DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enconman.2021.1144282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLee, Ziyoung10aEffects of fuel composition and engine operating conditions on particle number index in a direct injection spark ignition engine  aThe present research was conducted to propose an index for predicting particle number (PN) emissions from a direct injection spark ignition engine for various fuel compositions and injection strategies based on the demonstrated correlation between PN emissions and various parameters by using PN measurements and in-cylinder visualization. Experiments were conducted using a single-cylinder engine equipped with a direct injection system and visualization system. Three types of fuel were tested: indolene, indolene blended with 9.95% dodecane, and indolene blended with 9.2% divinylbenzene. The injection timing was varied from 330° to 180°CA BTDC during the intake process with injection pressures of 10, 20, and 35 MPa. The PN and particle size distributions were measured simultaneously using PPS-M and EEPS. Spray development and flame images were captured through a side quartz window placed on the upper side of the liner and a bottom quartz window installed in the center of the piston. When the dodecane blended fuel interacted with the piston, the presence of dodecane (with a higher viscosity and lower vapor pressure than indolene) increased the fuel mass adhered to the piston and deteriorated fuel film evaporation, thereby enlarging the diffusion flame and increasing PN emissions. Soot precursor molecules generated by the thermal dissociation of divinylbenzene, which contains multiple bonds, promoted the inception of particulate matter and particle growth, increasing the number of particles emitted and the average particle size for the divinylbenzene blend. A PN index was proposed as a function of the chemical structure, vapor pressure of the fuel components, and injection pressure. This index showed high predictability, with a correlation coefficient of 0.9354 for various fuel compositions and injection strategies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadministrative management 3achemical structure 3adissociation 3aenergy conversion 3aevaporation 3aparticle size 3aparticulates 3aquartz 3asoot 3aspark ignition engines 3avapor pressure 3aviscosity 0aASOI 0aASOS 0aDBE 0aBTDC 0aCA 0aDI 0aDISI 0aEGR 0aGDI 0aLPM 0aMBT 0aPAHs 0aPM 0aPMI 0aPN 0aTDC 0aVP 0aWe 0aDirect injection spark ignition engine 0aParticulate matter 0aParticle number emission 0aFuel components 0aParticle number index 0aInjection pressure1 aPark, Sungwook0 tEnergy conversion and management.g2021 Sept. 01, v. 243 p.114428-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11831x0196-89047nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enconman.2021.1144283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02344naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002500147245007400172300001800246520117000264592002801434650001101462650002401473650002101497650001801518650001201536650001801548650001501566650001201581650002001593650001301613700002501626700002101651700001801672700002101690773015601711856008201867852000901949655001201958IND60439781220221120232954.0190128e200709  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6043978122DNAL7 a10.1007/s10853-007-1676-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEsfehanian, Mohammad10aSilicide–carbide composites obtained from alloyed melt infiltration  ap. 7721-7728.  aThe development of a Cf/(Mo, Ti)Si₂–SiC composite using melt infiltration technique was investigated. C/C preforms and also Cf-felts were infiltrated with an alloyed melt of Si, Ti and MoSi₂. The amount of each element was selected so that the melting point of the alloy was lower than 1600 °C. It was then possible to prevent the melt from reacting heavily with the carbon fibers and preserve their reinforcing effect in case of the C/C preforms. After infiltration no residual silicon could be detected in the matrix of the infiltrated C/C composites. The infiltrated C/C samples reached a maximum bending strength of 210 MPa at room temperature. At 1600 °C there is even an increase in their bending strength to 250 MPa. Infiltrated felts showed monolithic and brittle characteristics. Their bending strength at room temperature was not higher than 150 MPa. Because of softening of the residual silicon, the strength of the infiltrated felts was reduced at high temperatures. The felt samples which were infiltrated with an alloyed melt showed higher mechanical strength than pure silicon infiltrated felts both at room temperature and at 1600 °C.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalloys 3aambient temperature 3abending strength 3acarbon fibers 3amelting 3amelting point 3amolybdenum 3asilicon 3asilicon carbide 3atitanium1 aHeinrich, Juergen G.1 aHorvath, Juergen1 aKoch, Dietmar1 aGrathwohl, Georg0 tJournal of materials science.g2007 Sept., v. 42, no. 18 p.7721-7728dKluwer Academic Publishers-Plenum PublisherswJournal:jnl4392857x0022-24617nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10853-007-1676-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01777naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002500147245008500172300001800257520081800275592002801093650001101121650001301132650001201145650001901157650001301176650001201189700002701201773015601228856008201384852000901466655001201475IND60439781320221120223600.0190128e200709  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6043978132DNAL7 a10.1007/s10853-007-1661-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMumtaz, Kamran Aamir10aLaser melting functionally graded composition of Waspaloy® and Zirconia powders  ap. 7647-7656.  aAn approach for fabricating functionally graded specimens of supernickel alloy and ceramic compositions via Selective Laser Melting (SLM) is presented.

In this study, epidemiological and etiological characteristics of 36 V. parahaemolyticus outbreaks that occurred from 2008 to 2010 in Guangdong province were analyzed; 284 strains involved were characterized by serotyping; virulence genes and 66 strains from four outbreaks therein were subtyped by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). Epidemiological evidence showed that 36% (13/36) of outbreaks were caused by food contamination, of which 84.6 % (11/13) were related to salted food, including viscera of pigs and cattle, meat, and vegetable salad. It was also indicated that 88.9% (32/36) of V. parahaemolyticus outbreaks appeared from June to September, 44.4% (16/36) of which occurred in canteens as well as 41.7% (15/36) in restaurants. As for the etiology, 31% (11/36) of outbreaks were caused by single serovar of strains, while 69% (25/36) were caused by multiserovars; O3:K6, O4:K8, O1:Kut, and O2:K3 were the dominant serovars. Among the 284 strains, 98.8% (254/257) of strains from patients were tdh-present and trh-absent, whereas 37.0% (10/27) from food were tdh-present. Cluster analysis of PFGE patterns demonstrated that strains in the same outbreak with identical serovar seemed to be diversified, whereas strains with various serovars could be closely related genetically. Moreover, cross-contamination between salted food and seafood was first confirmed by molecular subtyping in Guangdong, revealing that salted food might be a vital risk factor associated with V. parahaemolyticus outbreaks.  aPublisher supplied data 3aVibrio parahaemolyticus 3aanimal organs 3acattle 3acluster analysis 3across contamination 3aetiology 3afood contamination 3agenes 3ameat 3apatients 3apulsed-field gel electrophoresis 3arestaurants 3arisk factors 3asalads 3asalted foods 3aseafoods 3aserotypes 3aswine 3avegetables 3avirulence 3aChina1 aDeng, Xiaoling1 aKe, Changwen1 aHe, Dongmei1 aLiang, Zhaoming1 aLi, Wei1 aKe, BiXia1 aLi, Bosheng,1 aZhang, Yonghui1 aNg, Laiking1 aCui, Zhigang0 tFoodborne pathogens & disease.g2014 Jan. 01, v. 11, no. 1 p.21-29dMary Ann Liebert, Inc.x1556-71257nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1089%2Ffpd.2013.15223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04363naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100005700147245011200204300001800316500001900334520271700353592002803070650001603098650001903114650002603133650001603159650002003175650001403195650001003209650001003219650002003229650001303249650002703262650001303289650001403302650002003316650001003336650002103346650000903367650001803376651001203394653002203406653002903428653001603457653002603473700002003499700001603519700001303535700005603548773011503604856008103719852000903800655001203809IND60711298920221121222741.0200921e202010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071129892DNAL7 a10.1017/S17517311200008282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStygar, A.

This study aimed to investigate associations between the number of antimicrobial treatments per fattening pig, and biosecurity, indicators for animal welfare as well as the prevalence of lesions at slaughter. The data used in this study were extracted from the pig health and welfare classification system (Sikava), which gathers data on medicine usage, meat inspection, animal welfare and the condition of farm buildings from over 95% of pig production in Finland. The data were registered during years from 2011 to 2013. Upon antimicrobial prescription, information on the number of fattening pigs treated and the main reason for treatment was recorded. In addition, at least 4 times per year, pig farms registered in Sikava were visited by the farm veterinarian who assessed, among other things, biosecurity and indicators for animal welfare (air quality, condition of facilities, cleanliness, enrichment and stocking density). Finally, data from slaughterhouse inspections were collected (number of carcasses with joint infection, abscesses, lung lesions, pleurisy and liver lesions). For analysis, these datasets were aggregated at the farm level to a quarter of a year. During the studied period, the mean number of antimicrobial treatments per fattening pig per 3 months was equal to 0.09. The main reasons for antimicrobial treatments were musculoskeletal diseases, tail biting and respiratory disorders (42, 33 and 12% of diagnoses, respectively). The meat inspection scoring indicated that as much as 14.7% of all pigs had pleurisy, 5.3% liver lesions and 4.1% abscesses. A standard zero-inflated negative binomial model was used to identify factors associated with the number of antimicrobial treatments per pig. The count of antimicrobial treatments per pig increased with the size of a farm. Regardless of prevalence of lesions, farms with poor drinking equipment, insufficient enrichment and a combination of poor condition of pens and high stocking density were associated with an increased number of antimicrobial treatments for musculoskeletal diseases per pig. Problems with stocking density and enrichment were associated with the number of antimicrobial treatments for tail biting, although these results depended on prevalence of joint infections. Problems with air quality and the combination of poor cleanliness and poor condition of facilities were associated with increased number of antimicrobial treatments due to respiratory diseases. This study suggests that by improving biosecurity and welfare at pig farms, antimicrobial use can be reduced.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair quality 3aanimal welfare 3abinomial distribution 3abiosecurity 3adata collection 3aequipment 3aliver 3alungs 3ameat inspection 3amedicine 3amusculoskeletal system 3apleurisy 3aslaughter 3aslaughterhouses 3aswine 3aswine production 3atail 3aveterinarians 3aFinland 0aantimicrobial use 0amusculoskeletal diseases 0atail biting 0arespiratory disorders1 aChantziaras, I.1 aToppari, I.1 aMaes, D.1 aNiemi, J.

To elucidate the structural basis and mechanistic implications of TLR5-flagellin recognition, we determined the crystal structure of zebrafish TLR5 (as a variable lymphocyte receptor hybrid protein) in complex with the D1/D2/D3 fragment of Salmonella flagellin, FliC, at 2.47 angstrom resolution. TLR5 interacts primarily with the three helices of the FliC D1 domain using its lateral side. Two TLR5-FliC 1:1 heterodimers assemble into a 2:2 tail-to-tail signaling complex that is stabilized by quaternary contacts of the FliC D1 domain with the convex surface of the opposing TLR5. The proposed signaling mechanism is supported by structure-guided mutagenesis and deletion analyses on CBLB502, a therapeutic protein derived from FliC.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDanio rerio 3aSalmonella 3aToll-like receptor 5 3acrystal structure 3aflagellin 3ainnate immunity 3amutagenesis 3apathogens 3atranscription factor NF-kappa B1 aKurnasov, Oleg1 aNatarajan, Venkatesh1 aHong, Minsun1 aGudkov, Andrei V.1 aOsterman, Andrei L.1 aWilson, I.

Frequency estimates are based on presence/absence data from plots of fixed size, and plots are usually spatially aggregated into sites (often transects) to reduce field effort. Using a combination of statistical models and computer simulations, we identify sampling designs that maximize statistical power for detecting changes in underlying plant density based on the analysis of plant frequency. The optimal plot size for collecting frequency data decreases both with increasing spatial variation in local density (spatial structure) and with increasing numbers of plots per site. Over realistic ranges for these parameters, plots of optimal size yield mean frequencies that vary from 20%% to 80%%. However, with the exception of highly overdispersed populations, power is relatively insensitive to plot size; consequently, a plot size that yields a mean frequency of 50%% usually provides nearly maximal power. For population monitoring, in which comparisons are made between successive samples from the same population, repeated measures from fixed sites improve statistical power substantially if there is spatial structure among sites, provided that the spatial pattern is at least partially consistent over time. However, there is still a power loss to the extent that the pattern of spatial structure among sites changes over time (a site-by-time interaction). This power loss can be mitigated by increasing the spacing between plots within sites, which has the effect of increasing the within-site structure and reducing the between-site structure. With more than 1 plot per site, there is no statistical advantage to obtaining repeated measures from fixed plots; relocating plots within sites in successive samples may therefore be advisable to minimize disturbance to the community.  aPublisher supplied data 3aplant communities 3aenvironmental monitoring 3abotanical composition 3aplant density 3aspatial distribution 3adata collection 3asimulation models 3astatistical analysis 3apopulation structure 3avegetation 3aexperimental design 0aplant density 0aplot size 0aspatial structure 0astatistical power1 aDeBacker, Michael D.0 tRangeland ecology & management.g2007 July, v. 60, no. 4 p.426-434dSociety for Range Managementx1551-50287nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2111%2F1551-5028%282007%2960%5B426%3AOSDFMP%5D2.0.CO%3B23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03382naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094024002200124024001900146040001800165100001800183245008600201506007600287520159100363592002801954596001701982596007401999596004402073506003702117650001302154650001002167650001402177650002302191650001602214650002002230650001002250650001902260650001202279650001402291650000902305650002502314650001302339650002202352650001502374700002202389700002002411700002102431700002002452700002402472700001902496700002202515700002002537700005702557773010502614856007602719852000902795655001202804IND60624340420221207130451.0181203e20180426xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062434042DNAL7 a10.1155/2018/76259812doi7 aPMC59442802pmcid7 a298544432pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGeorges, John14aThe Effects of Krill Oil on mTOR Signaling and Resistance Exercise: A Pilot Study  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aIntroduction. Krill oil supplementation has been shown to improve postexercise immune function; however, its effect on muscle hypertrophy is currently unknown. Therefore, the aim of present study was to investigate the ability of krill oil to stimulate mTOR signaling and its ability to augment resistance training-induced changes in body composition and performance. Methods. C₂C₁₂ myoblasts cells were stimulated with krill oil or soy-derived phosphatidylcholine (S-PC), and then, the ratio of P-p70-389 to total p70 was used as readout for mTOR signaling. In double-blind, placebo-controlled study, resistance trained subjects consumed either 3 g krill oil daily or placebo, and each took part in an 8-week periodized resistance training program. Body composition, maximal strength, peak power, and rate of perceived recovery were assessed collectively at the end of weeks 0 and 8. In addition, safety parameters (comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP), complete blood count (CBC), and urine analysis (UA)) and cognitive performance were measured pre- and posttesting. Results. Krill oil significantly stimulated mTOR signaling in comparison to S-PC and control. No differences for markers on the CMP, CBC, or UA were observed. Krill oil significantly increased lean body mass from baseline (p=0.021, 1.4 kg, +2.1%); however, there were no statistically significant differences between groups for any measures taken. Conclusion. Krill oil activates mTOR signaling. Krill oil supplementation in athletes is safe, and its effect on resistance exercise deserves further research.  aPublisher supplied data  cRimfrost USA  cNational Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases  aAR057347cNational Institutes of Health0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aathletes 3ablood 3acognition 3aeducation programs 3ahypertrophy 3aimmune response 3akrill 3alean body mass 3amuscles 3amyoblasts 3aoils 3aphosphatidylcholines 3aplacebos 3astrength training 3aurinalysis1 aSharp, Matthew H.1 aLowery, Ryan P.1 aWilson, Jacob M.1 aPurpura, Martin1 aHornberger, Troy A.1 aHarding, Flint1 aJohnson, James H.1 aPeele, David M.1 aJäger, Ralf,1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7345-96350 tJournal of nutrition and metabolism.g2018 Apr. 26, v. 2018dHindawiwJournal:21568x2090-07327nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2018/76259813Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02259naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001500151245011300166300001600279500001900295520092100314592002801235596001901263596001201282650002101294650002001315650002401335650001201359650001201371650001201383650002301395650001001418651001701428653000901445653001501454653001601469653002001485653003001505700001301535700001301548700001401561773013201575856008501707852000901792655001201801IND60705335020221123024708.0200803e20200702xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070533502DNAL7 a10.2989/16085914.2019.17014042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHannweg, B10aUsing action cameras to estimate the abundance and habitat use of threatened fish in clear headwater streams  ap. 372-377.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aSnorkel and electrofishing surveys are the traditional baseline methods for fish surveys in clear headwater streams. However, action cameras provide a non-harmful alternative to monitor freshwater fish populations to develop informed conservation management initiatives. In this paper, estimates from photographs and videos from action cameras are compared with snorkel survey estimates of the density of a threatened endemic minnow species in a headwater stream, Eastern Cape, South Africa. Photograph-based relative abundances of fish summed over five microhabitats in each pool returned equivalent results to snorkel surveys, whereas the equivalent video-based abundance estimates were approximately 50% greater than the snorkel estimates. Therefore, photograph-derived estimates could be used as an alternative to snorkel surveys for fish population monitoring and habitat use studies in clear headwater streams.  aPublisher supplied data  a1010140,110507  aK5/2538 3afish communities 3afreshwater fish 3ahabitat preferences 3aminnows 3astreams 3asurveys 3athreatened species 3awater 3aSouth Africa 0aMaxN 0amonitoring 0aphotographs 0asnorkel surveys 0aunderwater video analysis1 aMarr, SM1 aBloy, LE1 aWeyl, OLF0 tAfrican journal of aquatic science.g2020 July 2, v. 45, no. 3 p.372-377dTaylor & FranciswJournal:J000000041x1727-93647nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2989/16085914.2019.17014043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02396naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002200140242007500162245009000237300001600327500001900343520126100362592002801623650002001651650002201671650001701693650001501710650002401725650001301749650001401762650001501776651001201791700001601803773013201819856007401951852000902025655001202034IND60735818920210617000000.0210428e200210  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073581892DNAL7 a10.1007/BF024655952doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVanhinsbergh, Des10aHabitatwahl von Neuntötern (Lanius collurio) in Kärnten, Österreich10aHabitat associations of the Red-backed Shrike (Lanius collurio) in Carinthia, Austria  ap. 405-415.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aIn 1997 and 1998, we investigated the habitat use of Red-backed Shrikes breeding on farmland in Carinthia, southern Austria. We devised an objective census technique to obtain relative measures of shrike abundance and habitat coverage along 35 1 km transect belts, 60 m in width, positioned randomly throughout an area of 100 1 km squares. Shrike abundance was related to habitat variables by means of general linear models. Bivariate models suggested that Red-backed Shrikes were positively associated with grassland grazed by livestock, fence-lines and scattered trees and shrubs, but negatively associated with arable land and grassland that was not grazed. A model constructed with the help of forward selection indicated that shrike abundance was most strongly associated with a mixture of grazed grassland and scrub. Shrike abundance increased with grazed grassland cover. When the cover of grazed grassland was kept constant, shrike abundance increased with scrub cover up to between 10 % and 15 % cover, and declined thereafter. We tested the validity of the model using data from a further 20 transects, collected in 1998. The number of shrikes predicted under the model was significantly positively correlated with the number of shrikes recorded.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLanius collurio 3aagricultural land 3aarable soils 3agrasslands 3ahabitat preferences 3ahabitats 3alivestock 3ashrublands 3aAustria1 aEvans, Andy0 tJournal für Ornithologie.g2002 Oct., v. 143, no. 4 p.405-415dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl3949854x0021-83757nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF024655953Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03321naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245013500165300001100300520157400311592002801885596006201913596006201975596006802037596008302105596008202188650002602270650002602296650001202322650001402334650001102348650001302359650002802372650002602400650001502426650001902441650002502460700001702485700001702502700001202519700001802531700001602549700005302565773012902618856008302747852000902830655001202839IND60782389020221122220935.0220716e202208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078238902DNAL7 a10.1007/s11738-022-03417-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXing, Li-Jun10aComparison between the exotic Coreopsis grandiflora and native Dendranthema indicum across variable nitrogen deposition conditions  ap. 82.  aFunctional trait values and phenotypic plasticity are the two main factors associated with the invasiveness of exotic plants. In this study, we aimed to determine the effects of plant functional traits and phenotypic plasticity on the invasiveness of exotic species under different nitrogen (N) deposition conditions, using the seedlings of the exotic Coreopsis grandiflora and the native Dendranthema indicum species. The results showed that N deposition increased the relative growth rate of height, total biomass, height, crown area, water use efficiency, leaf area, leaf biomass, root biomass, net photosynthesis rate, and leaf nitrogen to phosphorus ratio of the two species. Both C. grandiflora and D. indicum showed significant differences in all functional traits except photosynthetic nitrogen use efficiency. At low N levels, the performance (total biomass) in C. grandiflora was similar to that of D. indicum. However, at high N levels, the performance of C. grandiflora was greater than that of D. indicum, which is consistent with the “master-of-some” strategy of exotic plants. We discovered that the differences in the functional traits and phenotypic plasticity between the two species under high N environments promoted the rapid growth of C. grandiflora. Furthermore, the functional trait values of C. grandiflora made a greater contribution than phenotypic plasticity to its superior performance. Therefore, our findings provide insights into the mechanism employed by exotic species to facilitate invasion under variable N deposition conditions.  aPublisher supplied data  aNo.31500264cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  aNo.31971718cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  aNo.BS2015HZ020cNatural Science Foundation of Shandong Province  aNo. 6631115021cAdvanced Talents Foundation of Qingdao Agricultural University  aNo.6631120094cAdvanced Talents Foundation of Qingdao Agricultural University 3aChrysanthemum indicum 3aCoreopsis grandiflora 3abiomass 3aleaf area 3aleaves 3anitrogen 3anutrient use efficiency 3aphenotypic plasticity 3aphosphorus 3aphotosynthesis 3awater use efficiency1 aLi, Ming-Yan1 aJiang, Si-Yu1 aLi, Wei1 aGuo, Shao-Xia1 aLi, Hai-Mei1 aGuo, Xiao1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2268-50900 tActa physiologiae plantarum.g2022 Aug., v. 44, no. 8 p.82-82dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl33879x0137-58817nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11738-022-03417-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02672naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100002000141245013100161300001600292520107900308592002801387650002201415650004001437650002701477650001501504650000901519650000901528650001001537650002001547650001001567650003201577650001701609650001901626650001401645650001901659650001201678650001301690651001201703653001601715653001301731653001701744653002401761653001401785700002201799700002201821700002301843700002401866700002401890773013201914856007502046852000902121655001202130IND60680507220221120111653.0200107e20200106xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068050722DNAL7 a10.7589/2019-02-0342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCauvin, Allison10aAntibodies to Epizootic Hemorrhagic Disease Virus (EHDV) in Farmed and Wild Florida White-Tailed Deer (Odocoileus virginianus)  ap. 208-213.  aThe transmission of multiple serotypes of epizootic hemorrhagic disease virus (EHDV) between farmed and free-ranging wildlife is of interest to livestock industries and natural resource agencies. We compared the seroprevalence of EHDV-1, -2, and -6 in wild and farmed white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) herds in Florida, US. We compared serological prevalence, circulating serotypes, antibody titers, and viremia with the use of 171 whole-blood samples from 150 unvaccinated white-tailed deer from farm pens, a farm preserve, and wild deer on adjacent public lands between March 2016 and May 2017. Despite aggressive chemical vector control on the farm, we found higher seroprevalence and titers against the predominant EHDV serotype in farmed deer (in pens and the preserve) than in wild deer. The higher exposure to EHDV of farmed vs. wild deer may have been because of the higher densities of farmed vs. wild deer, the presence of exotic amplifying hosts such as elk (Cervus canadensis) in the preserve, or genetic factors that predisposed farmed deer to disease.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCervus canadensis 3aEpizootic hemorrhagic disease virus 3aOdocoileus virginianus 3aantibodies 3adeer 3aelks 3afarms 3agenetic factors 3aherds 3alivestock and meat industry 3apublic lands 3aseroprevalence 3aserotypes 3avector control 3aviremia 3awildlife 3aFlorida 0aBiosecurity 0aCervidae 0adeer farming 0ahemorrhagic disease 0aorbivirus1 aDinh, Emily T.

How an operation and specifically the guide facilitates the activity can shape tourists’ attitudes and change their behaviour towards the environment, turning consumers into stewards of the environment. This study examined the validity and success of a guide training workshop for CBT operators in the Ponta do Ouro Partial Marine Reserve (PPMR), Mozambique. A questionnaire survey was implemented pre- and post-training to measure the operators’ knowledge of aspects related to CBT and attitudes towards sustainable tourism and local regulations. Results suggest that the training workshop improved guide knowledge, which in some cases showed significant variations according to demographic variables namely, gender, education, and years of experience in the current job position. Mandatory guide training is recommended and should include not only product knowledge but also content on visitors’ expectations, interpretive guiding, and experience brokering. Presential training, refresher sessions, and English lessons are also advised. If these recommendations are put in place, then there is the potential for sustainable CBT to flourish in Mozambique, bringing much needed environmental and economic sustainability to this developing country.  aPublisher supplied data 3acase studies 3aeconomic sustainability 3aecotourism 3aeducation 3agender 3aproduct development 3aquestionnaires 3asurveys 3aMozambique1 aMarley, Sarah A.1 aDrakeford, Benjamin1 aPotts, Jonathan1 aGullan, Angie0 tJournal of coastal conservation.g2022 Aug., v. 26, no. 4 p.33-33dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:J000000609x1400-03507nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11852-022-00876-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02990naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002100148245015100169300001600320500001400336520128000350592002801630596004301658596002901701596009701730650002001827650002001847650001501867650002301882650003001905650002001935650002901955650001501984650001501999650002002014650002402034650001802058650001602076650001402092650001302106650001602119650002602135650001402161651001402175700002002189700002702209700002302236773011002259856008202369852000902451655001202460IND60725508320221119175559.0210126e202102  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072550832DNAL7 a10.1007/s10526-020-10063-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCédola, Claudia10aContributions to improve current environmental risk assessment procedures of generalist arthropod biological control agents (GABCAs) in Argentina  ap. 153-166.  aNAL-light  aArgentina has over 100 years of experience in classical biological control, mostly based on the importation of biological control agents (BCAs) against arthropod pests. We present the state-of-the-art of the importation regulatory framework from the last 30 years to date. We also applied a part of a recent developed environmental risk assessment (ERA) methodology to analyze retrospectively the potential negative effects on non-target species of 15 BCAs (12 parasitoids and three predators) imported since 1996 in Argentina, supported by the published literature (Tier 1 Scoping Assessment and Tier 2 Screening Assessment). We demonstrated that the previously imported species could have negative effects on non-target species [Adverse Effect risk characterization > 5 for ERA categories 2 (Reduction of native natural enemies), 3 (Reduction in herbivory) and 4 (Reduction in valued species)], which would be worth evaluating with a Definitive Assessment (Tier 3) and field research to determine if any were actually occurring. We discuss some suggestions for government organizations, state officials and decision makers, scientific researchers, and biological control practitioners to improve the current evaluation for the introduction of new BCAs into Argentina.  aPublisher supplied data  aN854cUniversidad Nacional de La Plata  aPUE CEPAVE 2016cCONICET  aPIDUNLP N829 2017-2020, PICT 2015 1427 (ANPCyT, Argentina)cUniversidad Nacional de La Plata 3aadverse effects 3aarthropod pests 3aarthropods 3abiological control 3abiological control agents 3adecision making 3aenvironmental assessment 3aherbivores 3aliterature 3anatural enemies 3anontarget organisms 3aorganizations 3aparasitoids 3apredators 3aresearch 3aresearchers 3arisk characterization 3ascreening 3aArgentina1 aLuna, María G.1 aAchinelly, M.

In this environmentally friendly synthetic method, silver nitrate was used as silver precursor and biocompatible chondroitin sulfate (ChS) was used as both reducing agent and stabilizing agent. The reaction was carried out in a stirring aqueous medium at the room temperature without any assisted by microwave, autoclave, laser irradiation, γ-ray irradiation or UV irradiation. The transparent colorless solution was converted to the characteristics light red then deep red-brown color as the reaction proceeds, indicating the formation of silver nanoparticles (Ag NPs). The Ag NPs were characterized by UV–visible spectroscopy (UV–vis), photon correlation spectroscopy, laser Doppler anemometry, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR). The results demonstrated that the obtained metallic nanoparticles were Ag NPs capped with ChS. In this report, dynamic light scattering (DLS) was used as a routinely analytical tool for measuring size and distribution in a liquid environment. The effects of the reaction time, reaction temperature, concentration and the weight ratio of ChS/Ag+ on the particle size and zeta potential were investigated. The TEM image clearly shows the morphology of the well-dispersed ChS-capped Ag NPs are spherical in shape, and the average size (<20nm) is much smaller than the Z-average value (76.7nm) measured by DLS. Meanwhile, the ChS-capped Ag NPs coated with N-[(2-hydroxy-3-trimethylammonium) propyl] chitosan chloride (HTCC) were prepared by an ionic gelation method and the surface charge of Ag NPs was switched from negative to positive.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aambient temperature 3aautoclaves 3achitosan 3achondroitin sulfate 3acolor 3agamma radiation 3agelation 3airradiation 3alight scattering 3amicrowave treatment 3amixing 3ananosilver 3aparticle size 3aphotons 3areducing agents 3asilver 3asilver nitrate 3atransmission electron microscopy 3aultraviolet radiation 3aultraviolet-visible spectroscopy 3azeta potential 0aGreen synthesis 0aSilver nanoparticles 0aChondroitin sulfate 0aChemical reduction 0aDynamic light scattering 0aN-[(2-hydroxy-3-trimethylammonium)propyl]chitosan chloride1 aHung, Yao-wen1 aChen, Cheng-cheung1 aLiu, Cheng-che1 aYoung, Jenn-jong0 tCarbohydrate polymers.g2014 Sept. 22, v. 110 p.195-202dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl47819x0144-86177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbpol.2014.03.0533Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02680naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002300094024002200117024001900139040001800158100001800176245010200194300001500296520130800311592002801619650001501647650001501662650001501677650001701692650001901709650001201728650000901740650002201749650002301771650001801794700002001812700001701832700001601849700002101865773015201886856007002038856010602108990002302214852000902237655001202246IND60608464820221119030100.0190510e20161019xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060846482DNAL7 a10.3791/545502doi7 aPMC50922132pmcid7 a278056122pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNg, Yan Cheng10aVisualization and quantification of the cell-free layer in arterioles of the rat cremaster muscle  ap. e54550.  aThe cell-free layer is defined as the parietal plasma layer in the microvessel flow, which is devoid of red blood cells. The measurement of the in vivo cell-free layer width and its spatiotemporal variations can provide a comprehensive understanding of hemodynamics in microcirculation. In this study, we used an intravital microscopic system coupled with a high-speed video camera to quantify the cell-free layer widths in arterioles in vivo. The cremaster muscle of Sprague-Dawley rats was surgically exteriorized to visualize the blood flow. A custom-built imaging script was also developed to automate the image processing and analysis of the cell-free layer width. This approach enables the quantification of spatiotemporal variations more consistently than previous manual measurements. The accuracy of the measurement, however, partly depends on the use of a blue filter and the selection of an appropriate thresholding algorithm. Specifically, we evaluated the contrast and quality of images acquired with and without the use of a blue filter. In addition, we compared five different image histogram-based thresholding algorithms (Otsu, minimum, intermode, iterative selection, and fuzzy entropic thresholding) and illustrated the differences in their determination of the cell-free layer width.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3aarterioles 3ablood flow 3aerythrocytes 3aimage analysis 3amuscles 3arats 3aspatial variation 3atemporal variation 3avideo cameras1 aFisher, Liam K.1 aSalim, Veena1 aKim, Sangho1 aNamgung, Bumseok0 tJournal of visualized experiments.g2016 Oct. 19, , no. 116 p.e54550-e54550dJournal of Visualized ExperimentswJournal:jnl4469330x1940-087X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3791/545503Available from publisher's site  uhttp://www.jove.com/video/54550/visualization-quantification-cell-free-layer-arterioles-rat-cremaster  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03914naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100001900138245017700157300001600334500002000350520205700370592002802427596007902455650002602534650002602560650001702586650002502603650002502628650001502653650000902668650001502677650002602692650001002718650001602728650004102744650002302785650002102808650001802829650002402847650001602871650001702887650001202904650001902916650002102935650001202956650002702968650002902995700003103024700001903055700002103074700002603095773013403121856007203255852000903327655001203336IND60682133920221119091712.0200125e202002  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068213392DNAL7 a10.1002/etc.46272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBrew, David W.10aMetabolomic Investigations of the Temporal Effects of Exposure to Pharmaceuticals and Personal Care Products and Their Mixture in the Eastern Oyster (Crassostrea virginica)  ap. 419-436.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe eastern oyster (Crassostrea virginica) supports a large aquaculture industry and is a keystone species along the Atlantic seaboard. Native oysters are routinely exposed to a complex mixture of contaminants that increasingly includes pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs). Unfortunately, the biological effects of chemical mixtures on oysters are poorly understood. Untargeted gas chromatography‐mass spectrometry metabolomics was utilized to quantify the response of oysters exposed to fluoxetine, N,N‐diethyl‐meta‐toluamide, 17α‐ethynylestradiol, diphenhydramine, and their mixture. Oysters were exposed to 1 µg/L of each chemical or mixture for 10 d, followed by an 8‐d depuration period. Adductor muscle (n = 14/treatment) was sampled at days 0, 1, 5, 10, and 18. Trajectory analysis illustrated that metabolic effects and class separation of the treatments varied at each time point and that, overall, the oysters were only able to partially recover from these exposures post‐depuration. Altered metabolites were associated with cellular energetics (i.e., Krebs cycle intermediates), as well as amino acid metabolism and fatty acids. Exposure to these PPCPs also affected metabolic pathways associated with anaerobic metabolism, osmotic stress, and oxidative stress, in addition to the physiological effects of each chemical's postulated mechanism of action. Following depuration, fewer metabolites were altered, but none of the treatments returned them to their initial control values, indicating that metabolic disruptions were long‐lasting. Interestingly, the mixture did not directly cluster with individual treatments in the scores plot from partial least squares discriminant analysis, and many of its affected metabolic pathways were not well predicted from the individual treatments. The present study highlights the utility of untargeted metabolomics in developing exposure biomarkers for compounds with different modes of action in bivalves.

However, little information is available about buckwheat-based (buckwheat-wheat-gluten) composite flour treated with gaseous ozone and fresh noodles made from the flour. This study investigated the microbial count, and physicochemical properties of buckwheat-based composite flour treated with gaseous ozone at 2.4 g h⁻¹ for 0, 2.5, 7.5 and 15 min and the shelf-life of fresh buckwheat noodles made from ozone-treated buckwheat-based composite flour (OTBF). Gaseous ozone significantly (p < 0.05) reduced the microbial total plate count and increased the CIE L* value, water absorption, development time, and stability time of the OTBF. The peak viscosity, final viscosity, setback, swelling capacity and solubility of the flour were also enhanced by ozone treatment. Scanning electron microscopy showed that ozone treatment facilitated the formation of more clumps and exposure of starch granules in the composite flour. In addition, gaseous ozone treatment at 2.4 g h⁻¹ for 15 min significantly suppressed microbial growth and reduction of L* value, maintained the overall sensory acceptability during the whole storage period, and the shelf-life of fresh noodles prepared from ozone-treated flour was extended to 96 h.  aPublisher supplied data 3abuckwheat 3aflour 3amicrobial growth 3aozonation 3aozone 3aplate count 3ashelf life 3asolubility 3astorage time 3aviscosity 3awater uptake 0aGaseous ozone 0aBuckwheat-wheat-gluten composite flour 0aMicrobial and physicochemical properties 0aShelf-life extension of fresh buckwheat noodle1 aLi, Xiaoping1 aJing, Yuchun1 aHu, Xinzhong1 aMa, Zhen1 aLiu, Rui1 aSong, Guihua1 aZhang, Daiyan0 tJournal of cereal science.g2020 Sept., v. 95 p.103055-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46803x0733-52107nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcs.2020.1030553Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01769naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245013900169300001600308520062300324592002800947653001500975653001700990653001501007653001301022653001601035653001801051653002101069700002201090700001801112700001901130773016701149856008201316961001201398852000901410655001201419IND60517082120221121065156.0190728e201508  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051708212DNAL7 a10.1017/S00253154140020942doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBonifácio, Paulo10aAnobothrus amourouxi sp. nov., a new species of Ampharetidae (Polychaeta) from the Capbreton Canyon (Bay of Biscay, NE Atlantic Ocean)  ap. 961-969.  aA new species of Ampharetidae, Anobothrus amourouxi sp. nov., has been identified from bathyal depths of the Capbreton Canyon, Bay of Biscay (NE Atlantic Ocean).

On the other hand, although Streptococcus macedonicus was first described more than 10 yr ago and, despite the scientific interest around this issue, the exact role of Strep. macedonicus in cheese making has yet to be clarified. In this study, 121 strains belonging to both species and isolated from the same dairy environment were genetically characterized by random amplification of polymorphic DNA (RAPD)-PCR and compared for the main biochemical features of technological interest, such as acid production, galactose utilization, citrate metabolism, exopolysaccharide production, and lipolytic, ureolytic, exocellular proteolytic, and decarboxylasic activities. Analysis by RAPD-PCR highlighted a remarkable genotypic heterogeneity among strains in both species, and, at a similarity level of 78%, all the isolates and reference strains of Strep. thermophilus grouped together and were well separated from the strains of Strep. macedonicus, confirming that these 2 species are different microbial entities.

The results suggest that, when the recycling rate is low, increasing it to its optimal level will result in more land area being devoted to forestry and, thus, more trees. However, increasing it beyond its optimal level will reduce the number of trees in the long run. In addition, the recycling rate that maximizes the forest area is optimal in the sense that it also maximizes the social net benefit. An application shows that increasing the recycling rate up to its optimal level considerably increases the forest area. The increase in the social net benefit is very small.  aPublisher supplied data 3aforest policy 3aforestry 3aforests 3amodels 3arecycling 3atrees 3awaste paper 0aRecycling rate 0aOptimal rotation 0aForestry 0aLand allocation 0aQ23 0aQ24 0aC130 tForest policy and economics.g2016 Dec., v. 73 p.264-269dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl64120x1389-93417nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.forpol.2016.09.0223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02306naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002500151245011900176300001600295520097700311592002801288650001901316650001801335650001301353650002001366650001201386650001101398650001301409650001101422650001301433650001301446650001301459650001201472650001101484653002501495653002301520653001901543653002701562653003501589653002001624700001801644773009201662856008501754852000901839655001201848IND60599445820221119184103.0180702e20141101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059944582DNAL7 a10.1016/j.talanta.2014.06.0262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPietrzyńska, Monika10aOptimization of the in-needle extraction device for the direct flow of the liquid sample through the sorbent layer  ap. 392-397.  aIn-needle extraction was applied for preparation of aqueous samples. This technique was used for direct isolation of analytes from liquid samples which was achieved by forcing the flow of the sample through the sorbent layer: silica or polymer (styrene/divinylbenzene). Specially designed needle was packed with three different sorbents on which the analytes (phenol, p-benzoquinone, 4-chlorophenol, thymol and caffeine) were retained. Acceptable sampling conditions for direct analysis of liquid sample were selected. Experimental data collected from the series of liquid samples analysis made with use of in-needle device showed that the effectiveness of the system depends on various parameters such as breakthrough volume and the sorption capacity, effect of sampling flow rate, solvent effect on elution step, required volume of solvent for elution step. The optimal sampling flow rate was in range of 0.5–2mL/min, the minimum volume of solvent was at 400µL level.  aPublisher supplied data 3a4-chlorophenol 3abenzoquinones 3acaffeine 3adata collection 3aliquids 3aphenol 3apolymers 3asilica 3asolvents 3asorbents 3asorption 3astyrene 3athymol 0aIn-needle extraction 0aNeedle trap device 0aLiquid samples 0aPermeability in needle 0aPoly(styrene–divinylbenzene) 0aSilica sorbents1 aVoelkel, Adam0 tTalanta.g2014 Nov. 01, v. 129 p.392-397dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11742x0039-91407nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.talanta.2014.06.0263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04640naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245014000169300001400309520328400323592002803607650001503635650001003650650001703660650001403677650002003691650002203711650001203733650001303745650001503758650003403773650001403807650001303821650000903834650001703843650001203860650001603872651001203888653002803900653003103928653002003959773010903979856008504088852000904173655001204182IND60557542620221122122501.0190411e201804  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055754262DNAL7 a10.1016/j.forpol.2016.10.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDragoi, Marian10aJoining or not joining non-industrial private forests into a single management unit: A case-study shaped as an Analytic Network Process  ap. 63-70.  aThe study aims to find out how the management of non-industrial private forests (NIPF) can be improved by a larger and more consistent participation of all important stakeholders involved in making one of the most important decisions the forest management planning system copes with: whether or not the forest planner shall create a separate forest management unit for NIPFs, considering a wider variety of interconnected benefits, costs risks and opportunities.The decision making process was conceived as an Analytic Network Process (ANP) and all important aspects worth being taken into consideration were embodied in four conceptual subnets that gather benefits, opportunities costs and risks defined from three different perspectives: social, economic and ecological. The method was tested on an important decision which is made each ten years when the forest management plans shall be updated. The input data were collected from two small associations of landowners whose forests are managed by Solca forest district (FD), county of Suceava, Romania. The total forest area supposed to be included in the new management unit is about 360ha and the natural type of forest is beech, mixed with silver fir. Two alternatives were taken into account: the business as usual scenario (the same rotation for all stands and the same silvicultural system, irrespective to the ownership type) and a new management unit, explicitly designed for NIPF, where coppice with standards will produce fuelwood and small size round wood for rural construction.An extensive survey was carried out in order to find out the most important criteria worth being taken into account when such a decision shall be made, as well as the landowners' expectations, concerns and uncertainties with respect to the two options: business as usual scenario and a new FMU respectively. A second survey was distributed among the villagers of a neighboring commune in order to appraise the local demand for fuelwood. Based on the information collected at the first hand four subnets referring to benefits, costs, opportunities and risks have been produced and, within each subnet, three different clusters were defined in order to appraise the relative importance of economic, social, and ecologic aspects. Making pairwise comparisons between alternatives against criteria, clusters, and subnets, we have concluded that a new management unit for NIPFs is feasible and desirable. Even though ANP seems to be a very flexible tool for making complex decisions, any potential user shall be aware of some risks pertaining to ANP methodology, especially the tendency to make too complex networks, compelling to pairwise comparisons that make less sense. On the other hand, the case study presented in this article has demonstrated that pairwise comparisons may refer not only to the relative importance of whatever two criteria or alternatives, but also to the likelihood or desirability of some certain processes that might occur in case of pursuing one of the two alternatives taken into consideration. The procedure we have proposed for making or not making a new FMU can be developed or adapted to other situations where a consistent dialogue between the decision makers and the stakeholders is a more than necessary.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAbies alba 3aFagus 3acase studies 3acoppicing 3adecision making 3aforest management 3aforests 3afuelwood 3alandowners 3anonindustrial private forests 3aownership 3aplanning 3arisk 3astakeholders 3asurveys 3auncertainty 3aRomania 0aDecision-making methods 0aAdaptive forest management 0aForest planning0 tForest policy and economics.g2018 Apr., v. 89 p.63-70dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl64120x1389-93417nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.forpol.2016.10.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle05166naa a2200709 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003100113040001800144100001700162245017100179300001800350500001500368520306700383592002803450650001403478650002103492650001203513650001503525650000903540650001303549650001003562650001503572650001603587650001003603650001803613650002103631650001903652650001303671650001803684650001203702650001703714650002303731650002003754650001703774650002403791650002203815650001003837650001203847650002303859650005703882650001303939650002103952650003803973650002104011650001104032650002704043650003904070650004204109650001404151650003404165653000904199700001604208700001604224700001804240773010004258856007704358852000904435655001204444IND60083367020221120080847.0141101e201112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008336702DNAL7 a221180792pmid7 a10.3168/jds.2010-33912doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuzzey, J.M.10aAssociations of prepartum plasma cortisol, haptoglobin, fecal cortisol metabolites, and nonesterified fatty acids with postpartum health status in Holstein dairy cows  ap. 5878-5889.  a2019-12-06  aThe association between negative energy balance and health has led to the testing of blood analytes such as nonesterified fatty acids (NEFA) to identify opportunities for improving the management of transition dairy cows. The objective of this study was to evaluate whether prepartum analytes associated with stress (cortisol) or inflammation (haptoglobin) could also identify dairy cattle at increased risk for health complications after calving. Prepartum blood and fecal samples were collected once weekly from 412 Holstein dairy cows on 2 commercial dairy farms (at wk −3, −2, and −1 relative to calving) and analyzed for concentrations of NEFA, haptoglobin (Hp), and cortisol in plasma and cortisol metabolites in feces. Retained placenta (RP), displaced abomasum (DA), subclinical ketosis (SCK), high Hp concentration (HiHp), and death were recorded up to 30 d in milk (DIM), and animals were subsequently categorized into 3 health categories: (1) no disorder of interest (NDI); (2) one disorder (RP, DA, SCK, or HiHp); or (3) more than one disorder (RP, DA, SCK, HiHp) or death. With the exception of prepartum NEFA, no associations were detected between prepartum concentrations of our analytes of interest and the occurrence of one disorder (RP, DA, SCK, or HiHP) by 30 DIM. Haptoglobin concentration tended to be greater during wk −2 and −1 in cows that developed more than one disorder or that died by 30 DIM; however, when calving assistance was included as a covariate in the analysis prepartum, Hp was no longer a significant risk factor for this postpartum health outcome. Primiparous cows with plasma cortisol concentrations >22.2nmol/L during wk −2 had reduced odds [odds ratio (OR) 0.41; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.17–0.98] of developing more than one disorder or death by 30 DIM, whereas multiparous cows with plasma cortisol >34.1nmol/L during wk −2 tended to have greater odds (OR 2.53; 95% CI 0.87–7.37) of developing more than one disorder or death by 30 DIM. Individual variation in daily cortisol secretion patterns and stress responses to the restraint and handling associated with sample collection make prepartum plasma cortisol data and its relationship to postpartum health difficult to interpret. Among multiparous cows, for every 500-unit (ng/g of fecal dry matter) increase in fecal cortisol metabolite concentration during wk −2, cows had increased odds (OR 1.41; 95% CI 1.12–1.79) of developing more than one disorder or dying after calving. For multiparous cows, every 0.15mmol/L increase in plasma NEFA concentration during any of the 3 wk before calving was associated with an approximately 2-fold increase in the odds of developing more than one disorder or dying by 30 DIM. Fecal cortisol metabolite concentration during the prepartum period did not predict which cows would go on to develop more than one disorder or die within 30 DIM as accurately as prepartum NEFA concentration; therefore, this analyte is not a suitable substitute for NEFA for assessing opportunities to improve herd health.  aPublisher supplied data 3asecretion 3afree fatty acids 3aketosis 3aodds ratio 3amilk 3aHolstein 3ablood 3adairy cows 3aherd health 3afeces 3adairy farming 3aprepartum period 3aenergy balance 3acortisol 3ahealth status 3acalving 3arisk factors 3adisplaced abomasum 3astress response 3ainflammation 3aconfidence interval 3aretained placenta 3adeath 2aAnimals 2aCattlexphysiology 2aCattle Diseasesxbloodxmetabolismxphysiopathology. 2aDairying 2aDietxveterinary 2aFatty Acids, Nonesterifiedxblood 2aFecesxchemistry 2aFemale 2aHaptoglobinsxanalysis 2aHydrocortisonexbloodxmetabolism. 2aPostpartum Periodxbloodxphysiology. 2aPregnancy 2aPregnancy, Animalxphysiology 0arisk1 aNydam, D.V.1 aGrant, R.J.1 aOverton, T.R.0 tJournal of dairy science.g2011 Dec., v. 94, no. 12 p.5878-5889dElsevier Inc.x0022-03027nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3168/jds.2010-33913Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02386naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002000140242009200160245008700252300001600339500001900355520115500374592002801529650002601557650002201583650001201605650001001617650001701627650001001644650001001654650002101664650001001685650000901695650001101704651001001715700001901725700001701744773013201761856007401893852000901967655001201976IND60735819320210617000000.0210428e200210  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073581932DNAL7 a10.1007/BF024655992doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMartens, Jochen10aCerthia tianquanensis Li, ein Baumläufer mit reliktärer Verbreitung in Sichuan, China10aCerthia tianquanensis Li, a treecreeper with relict distribution in Sichuan, China  ap. 440-455.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aCerthia tianquanensis Li, 1995, is characterised as a distinct species and is combined withC. discolor in the superspeciesC.

It is characterised by a long tail (likeC. discolor), an extremely short bill (similar toC. nipalensis), the patterning on the underside, with white chin and throat and beige chest and abdomen (likeC. himalayana), a striking voice (clearly different fromC. discolor and all otherCerthia species), and a large genetic distance fromC. d. discolor in the cytochrome-b gene. Unlike its closest relativeC. discolor, C. tianquanensis belongs to the Palearctic fauna; it lives in a region of China inhabited by a number of relict species, several of which are closely related to species in the northern taiga zone.C. tianquanensis is not a close relative ofC. familiaris, although it was originally described as a subspecies of the latter and they are locally syntopic. The number of species in the genusCerthia thus rises from six to seven. — Chinese summary: www.do-g.de/journals/  aPublisher supplied data 3aCerthia tianquanensis 3aPalearctic region 3aabdomen 3achest 3acytochrome b 3afauna 3agenes 3agenetic distance 3ataiga 3atail 3athroat 3aChina1 aEck, Siegfried1 aSun, Yue-Hua0 tJournal für Ornithologie.g2002 Oct., v. 143, no. 4 p.440-455dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl3949854x0021-83757nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF024655993Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03292naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002300094024002200117024001900139040001800158100002700176245012300203300001500326520196000341592002802301650001202329650001402341650003302355650001302388650001802401650001102419650001202430650001302442650001202455650001602467650001602483700002602499773015202525856007002677856010302747990002302850852000902873655001202882IND60608464920221119030050.0190510e20170212xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060846492DNAL7 a10.3791/545512doi7 aPMC57796872pmcid7 a282875232pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRananavare, Shankar B.10aUse of sacrificial nanoparticles to remove the effects of shot-noise in contact holes fabricated by e-beam lithography  ap. e54551.  aNano-patterns fabricated with extreme ultraviolet (EUV) or electron-beam (E-beam) lithography exhibit unexpected variations in size. This variation has been attributed to statistical fluctuations in the number of photons/electrons arriving at a given nano-region arising from shot-noise (SN). The SN varies inversely to the square root of a number of photons/electrons. For a fixed dosage, the SN is larger in EUV and E-beam lithographies than for traditional (193 nm) optical lithography. Bottom-up and top-down patterning approaches are combined to minimize the effects of shot noise in nano-hole patterning. Specifically, an amino-silane surfactant self-assembles on a silicon wafer that is subsequently spin-coated with a 100 nm film of a PMMA-based E-beam photoresist. Exposure to the E-beam and the subsequent development uncover the underlying surfactant film at the bottoms of the holes. Dipping the wafer in a suspension of negatively charged, citrate-capped, 20 nm gold nanoparticles (GNP) deposits one particle per hole. The exposed positively charged surfactant film in the hole electrostatically funnels the negatively charged nanoparticle to the center of an exposed hole, which permanently fixes the positional registry. Next, by heating near the glass transition temperature of the photoresist polymer, the photoresist film reflows and engulfs the nanoparticles. This process erases the holes affected by SN but leaves the deposited GNPs locked in place by strong electrostatic binding. Treatment with oxygen plasma exposes the GNPs by etching a thin layer of the photoresist. Wet-etching the exposed GNPs with a solution of I2/KI yields uniform holes located at the center of indentations patterned by E-beam lithography. The experiments presented show that the approach reduces the variation in the size of the holes caused by SN from 35% to below 10%. The method extends the patterning limits of transistor contact holes to below 20 nm.  aPublisher supplied data 3adipping 3aelectrons 3aglass transition temperature 3ananogold 3ananoparticles 3aoxygen 3aphotons 3apolymers 3asilicon 3asurfactants 3atransistors1 aMorakinyo, Moshood K.0 tJournal of visualized experiments.g2017 Feb. 12, , no. 120 p.e54551-e54551dJournal of Visualized ExperimentswJournal:jnl4469330x1940-087X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3791/545513Available from publisher's site  uhttp://www.jove.com/video/54551/use-sacrificial-nanoparticles-to-remove-effects-shot-noise-contact  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03384naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005900148245012400207300001200331500001400343500001100357520170900368592002802077596003202105596003602137650002002173650001502193650002302208650003002231650001402261650002902275650002402304650001402328650001302342650001102355650001602366650002002382650002402402650001602426650001702442650001302459650000902472651001402481651001602495700006602511700002802577700002502605773010602630856008202736961001502818852000902833655001202842IND60725508520221119175645.0210126e202102  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072550852DNAL7 a10.1007/s10526-020-10067-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAndow, David A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7730-268610aExotic generalist arthropod biological control agents: need to improve environmental risk assessment to ensure safe use  ap. 1-8.  aNAL-light  aReview  aExotic generalist arthropod biological control agents (GABCAs) have been historically marginalized in classical and augmentative biological control due to their broad diet breadth, but an increasing demand for a more sustainable pest control is encouraging their reconsideration. This special issue compiles a collection of papers revealing that risks of several exotic GABCAs were overestimated, not all generalists are riskier than specialists and their environmental risk assessment (ERA) solely based on exposure analysis is inadequate. Three papers demonstrated that generalists were not involved in predicted non-target interactions: generalist idiobiont parasitoids probably do not exhibit interference competition with each other, an oligophagous exotic egg-larval koinobiont parasitoid does not compete with a native larval koinobiont, and an invasive generalist predator does not escape from its enemies. Two innovative methods for selecting non-target species are proposed, one based on existing food web data to predict indirect non-target effects, and the other on functional traits to predict competition with native natural enemies. Also a comprehensive GABCA-ERA method is proposed that integrates adverse effect analysis to the ‘conventional’ exposure analysis. The method was scrutinized by two studies: one suggesting that it could have resulted in faster and less costly decisions on two exotic generalists in New Zealand, and the other suggesting that eight exotic GABCAs released in Argentina might potentially reduce native natural enemies. We hope this special issue will stimulate the continued advance in the biosafety research of GABCAs so their safe use does not stagnate.  aPublisher supplied data  a2019-67013-29406cUSDA-NIFA  aSEG 12.13.12.005.00.00cEMBRAPA 3aadverse effects 3aarthropods 3abiological control 3abiological control agents 3abiosafety 3aenvironmental assessment 3aexposure assessment 3afood webs 3aforaging 3alarvae 3amethodology 3anatural enemies 3anontarget organisms 3aparasitoids 3apest control 3aresearch 3arisk 3aArgentina 3aNew Zealand1 aBarratt, Barbara I.

This study tested the hypothesis that Fe-deficiency-responsive genes, particularly OsNRAMP1, play a role in the increased Cd uptake that occurs when rice is grown in aerobic soil conditions. METHODS: Plants were grown in aerobic or flooded soil conditions. Uptake of Cd was compared to levels of expression of candidate metal transporters and to metal ion availability in soil. RESULTS: Plants grown with intermittent soil flooding experienced a predominantly aerobic root environment and had the highest plant Cd uptake. Stronger upregulation of OsNRAMP1 was detected in plants grown in unflooded soil than in flooded soil. However, these transcriptional responses were not linked to an increase in Cd uptake. Overexpression of OsNRAMP1 was not found to increase the uptake of Cd in rice in soil or solution culture. In contrast, there were large differences in availability of Cd, Fe and Mn between flooded and aerobic soils, which were linked to changes in Cd uptake. CONCLUSIONS: Aerobic soil conditions favour Cd uptake through increased Cd availability and decreased competition between Cd and Fe rather than through the increased expression of the Fe transporters themselves.  aPublisher supplied data 3afloods 3agenes 3airrigation management 3ametal ions 3ametals 3apaddy soils 3arice 3arice soils 3aroots 3asoil quality 3asoil solution 3atransporters1 aReid, Robert J.0 tPlant and soil.g2013 Oct., v. 371, no. 1-2 p.219-236dSpringer-Verlagx0032-079X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11104-013-1674-4  aDNAL 7aarticle03575naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094024002200120024001900142040001800161100005800179245012300237300001600360500002000376506007600396520186600472592002802338596007302366596005002439506003702489650001702526650001602543650002102559650001302580650001002593650001602603650003402619650003402653650002702687650000902714650001502723650001902738651001502757700002002772700001702792700002002809700002502829773013402854856007202988852000903060655001203069IND60682134220221207063514.0200125e202002  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068213422DNAL7 a10.1002/etc.46152doi7 aPMC70650992pmcid7 a316106072pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchultes, Lara1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3409-438910aTemporal Trends (1981–2013) of Per‐ and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances and Total Fluorine in Baltic cod (Gadus morhua)  ap. 300-309.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aTemporal trends from 1981 to 2013 of 28 per‐ and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) were investigated in liver tissue of cod (Gadus morhua) sampled near southeast Gotland, in the Baltic Sea. A total of 10 PFASs were detected, with ∑₂₈PFAS geometric mean concentrations ranging from 6.03 to 23.9 ng/g ww. Perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) was the predominant PFAS, which increased at a rate of 3.4% per year. Most long‐chain perfluoroalkyl carboxylic acids increased at rates of 3.9 to 7.3% per year except for perfluorooctanoate (PFOA), which did not change significantly over time. The perfluoroalkyl acid precursors perfluorooctane sulfonamide (FOSA) and 6:2 fluorotelomer sulfonic acid were detected, of which the former (FOSA) declined at a rate of –4.4% per year, possibly reflecting its phase‐out starting in 2000. An alternate time trend analysis from 2000 to 2013 produced slightly different results, with most compounds increasing at slower rates compared to the entire study period. An exception was perfluorohexane sulfonate (PFHxS), increasing at a faster rate of 3.7% measured from 2000 on, compared to the 3.0% per year measured starting from 1981. Analysis of the total fluorine content of the samples revealed large amounts of unidentified fluorine; however, its composition (organic or inorganic) remains unclear. Significant negative correlations were found between concentrations of individual PFASs (with the exception of PFOS) and liver somatic index. In addition, body length was negatively correlated with PFOA and perfluorononanoate, but positively correlated with perfluorododecanoate (PFDoDA) and FOSA. Additional studies on endocrine, immunological, and metabolic effects of PFAS in marine fish are essential to assess the environmental risk of these substances.

In one of the areas most affected by nitrates, the Lombardy Plain (Italy), the effectiveness of the ND and the capacity of governance to support its application correctly was assessed using a socio-hydrogeological approach. Nitrate trends over 11 years show that most regions present steady or increasing concentrations, highlighting how contamination can affect previously impaired situations and supposedly resistant and resilient aquifers. Stakeholder network analysis reveals that the governance framework does not support knowledge dissemination and changes in farmers’ attitudes, hindering water quality improvements. Nitrogen input needs to be reduced and manure relocation monitored. The local governance scale has a key role in enhancing ND dissemination. Reports to the EU Commission should integrate multi- or interdisciplinary evaluation of trends, including governance dynamics, alongside hydrochemical information.  aPublisher supplied data  a2015-0263cFondazione Cariplo (IT)0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aEuropean Union 3aaquifers 3aecosystems 3afarmers' attitudes 3agovernance 3agroundwater 3ahuman health 3ahydrochemistry 3anitrates 3anitrogen 3astakeholders 3awater quality 3aItaly1 aRe, Viviana1 aMas-Pla, Josep1 aSacchi, Elisa0 tAmbio.g2020 Feb., v. 49, no. 2 p.504-516dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl28633x0044-74477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13280-019-01197-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03164naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100002000138245012200158300001600280500002000296520159000316592002801906596005501934596006901989650001902058650001002077650001002087650001802097650002102115650002002136650001002156650001102166650001402177650001802191650002302209650001302232650002102245650002102266650001502287650002602302700002302328700002102351700002102372700002102393700002902414773013402443856007202577852000902649655001202658IND60682134320221119090003.0200125e202002  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068213432DNAL7 a10.1002/etc.46262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDahora, Lara I.14aThe Flavor Enhancer Maltol Increases Pigment Aggregation in Dermal and Neural Melanophores in Xenopus laevis Tadpoles  ap. 381-395.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aMelanophores are pigmented cells that change the distribution of melanosomes, enabling animals to appear lighter or darker for camouflage, thermoregulation, and protection from ultraviolet radiation. A complex series of hormonal and neural mechanisms regulates melanophore pigment distribution, making these dynamic cells a valuable tool to screen toxicants as they rapidly respond to changes in the environment. We found that maltol, a naturally occurring flavor enhancer and fragrance agent, induces melanophore pigment aggregation in a dose‐dependent manner in Xenopus laevis tadpoles. To determine if maltol affects camouflage adaptation, we placed tadpoles into maltol baths situated over either a white or a black background. Maltol induced pigment aggregation in a similar dose‐dependent pattern regardless of background color. We also tested how maltol treatment compares to melatonin treatment and found that the degree of pigment aggregation induced by maltol is similar to treatment with melatonin but that maltol induces over a much longer time course. Last, maltol had no effect on mRNA expression in the brain of genes that regulate camouflage‐related pigment aggregation. The present results suggest that maltol does not exert its effects via the camouflage adaptation mechanism or via melatonin‐related mechanisms. These results are the first to identify a putative toxicological effect of maltol exposure in vivo and rule out several mechanisms by which maltol may exert its effects on pigment aggregation.

Eighteen ejaculates, obtained from 6 male llamas using electroejaculation, were incubated in 0.1% collagenase in HEPES-TALP (HT), centrifuged and resuspended with SP and HT: 0, 10, 50 and 100% SP. Samples were incubated (37 °C) until evaluation at 0; 1.5 and 3 h. Split plot and factorial designs were used to analyze sperm motility, viability, membrane function and acrosome status and Spearman’s test was used for correlation. At 0 h, samples with 100% SP showed oscillatory motility; whereas in samples with 0 and 10% SP, progressive motility was predominant. Viability, membrane function and total motility decreased significantly at 3 h of incubation in samples with 100% SP. Sperm with intact acrosomes were fewer in 0% SP media at all times. FITC-PNA/PI correlated with 6-Carboxyfluorescein Diacetate and Propidium Iodide (CFDA/PI) and with Coomassie Blue (CB) stains (r = 0.8; p = 0.0 and r = 0.5; p = 0.0 respectively). Conclusions: the motility pattern of llama sperm is influenced by the concentration of SP. The use of SP as the only medium is not able to maintain sperm motility, viability and membrane function for 3 h. A certain percentage of SP is necessary in the medium to avoid spontaneous acrosome reactions. The correlations observed could help to shorten evaluation times and reduce costs in sperm laboratories.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacrosome 3aagglutinins 3acollagenase 3acost effectiveness 3afluorescein 3aisothiocyanates 3allamas 3amales 3apropidium 3aseminal plasma 3asperm motility 3asperm quality 3asurvival rate 3aviability 0aLlama 0aSpermatozoa 0aSeminal plasma1 aGiuliano, S.M.1 aChaves, M.G.1 aNeild, D.M.1 aMiragaya, M.H.1 aGambarotta, M.C.1 aCarretero, M.I.0 tAnimal reproduction science.g2018 May, v. 192 p.99-106dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl11636x0378-43207nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.anireprosci.2018.02.0193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04369naa a2200721 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003100113040001800144100001600162245017500178300001800353520210400371592002802475650002602503650001502529650001902544650001002563650001202573650000902585650001602594650002202610650001202632650001402644650002102658650002002679650003102699650001002730650001702740650001602757650001002773650002702783650001802810650004302828650002102871650002502892650001202917650001102929650002102940650003102961650003802992650001103030650002803041650004503069650002803114650002103142650003803163650001403201650005203215650005903267650003603326700001703362700001703379700001903396700001903415700001503434773010003449856007703549852000903626655001203635IND60083367320221120102023.0141101e201112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008336732DNAL7 a221180822pmid7 a10.3168/jds.2011-42302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchmitt, E.10aDietary lipid during the transition period to manipulate subcutaneous adipose tissue peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ co-regulator and target gene expression  ap. 5913-5925.  aObjectives were to determine adipose tissue mRNA expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)γ co-regulators, target enzymes and transcription regulators, inflammation-related genes, and adipokines in response to dietary long-chain fatty acids (LCFA). From −21 through 10 d relative to parturition cows were fed no supplemental LCFA (control), saturated LCFA (SFAT; mainly 16:0 and 18:0), or fish oil (FO). Lipid was fed at 250 g/d prepartum or approximately 1.5 to 1.9% of the previous day's dry matter intake postpartum. Transcript profiling of 35 genes via quantitative PCR was conducted on biopsies (n=5 cows/diet) collected at −14 and 11 d from parturition. Despite lower dry matter intake with FO, pre- and postpartal blood nonesterified fatty acids, β-hydroxybutyrate, and liver triacylglycerol were unaffected by treatment but increased after calving regardless of diet. Prepartal expression of adipogenic/lipogenic transcription regulators [CEBPA, CEBPB, RXRA, KLF5, and MLXIPL (formerly ChREBP)] and co-regulators (CARM1, EP300, NCOA1, MED1, NCOR2, and NRIP1) was upregulated by FO and SFAT versus control, whereas most enzymes involved in lipogenesis/triacylglycerol synthesis (FASN, SCD, DGAT2, and LPIN1) had greater expression only with FO. Expression of most adipogenic/lipogenic genes decreased after parturition, but feeding SFAT led to sustained upregulation of CEBPA, CEBPB, RXRA, several PPAR-co-activators, and DGAT2 and SCD, suggesting maintenance of a pro-adipogenic/pro-lipogenic state with SFAT. The co-activator CREBBP was greater in cows fed lipid and did not decrease after parturition, suggesting ligand activation of PPARγ. The greater peripartal expression of NFKB1 and TBK1 due to dietary lipid was suggestive of a local inflammatory response. At amounts fed prepartum, both FO and SFAT were effective in upregulating the adipose tissue PPARγ-gene network. In contrast, only SFAT led to sustaining that response. Overall, the observed expression patterns are suggestive of an adipogenic regulatory mechanism particularly responsive to SFAT.  aPublisher supplied data 3a3-hydroxybutyric acid 3aadipokines 3aadipose tissue 3ablood 3acalving 3acows 3adietary fat 3adry matter intake 3aenzymes 3afish oils 3afree fatty acids 3agene expression 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3ainflammation 3alipogenesis 3aliver 3along chain fatty acids 3amessenger RNA 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3atriacylglycerols 2aAdipokinesxanalysis 2aAnimals 2aCattle 2aDietxveterinary 2aDietary Fatsxpharmacology 2aFatty Acidsxbloodxpharmacology. 2aFemale 2aFish Oilsxpharmacology 2aGene Expression Regulationxdrug effects 2aLactationxdrug effects 2aLiverxchemistry 2aPPAR gammaxanalysisxmetabolism. 2aPregnancy 2aReal-Time Polymerase Chain Reactionxveterinary 2aSubcutaneous Fatxchemistryxdrug effectsxmetabolism. 2aTranscription Factorsxanalysis1 aBallou, M.A.1 aCorrea, M.N.1 aDePeters, E.J.1 aDrackley, J.K.1 aLoor, J.J.0 tJournal of dairy science.g2011 Dec., v. 94, no. 12 p.5913-5925dElsevier Inc.x0022-03027nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3168/jds.2011-42303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02172naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002400151245008000175300001600255520103600271592002801307650001801335650001801353650001201371650002501383653000801408653000801416653000801424653001801432653001201450653001901462653002201481653002501503653002701528653001401555700001701569773009301586856008601679852000901765655001201774IND60581729720221119092817.0190402e201610  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058172972DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodpol.2016.10.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCosta-i-Font, Joan,10a‘Globesity’? The effects of globalization on obesity and caloric intake  ap. 121-132.  aWe examine the effect of globalization, in its economic and social dimensions, on obesity and caloric intake, namely the so –called ‘globesity’ hypothesis. Our results suggest a robust association between globalization and both obesity and caloric intake. A one standard deviation increase in globalization is associated with a 23.8 percent increase in obese population and a 4.3 percent rise in calorie intake. The effect remains statistically significant even after using an instrumental variable strategy to correct for some possible reverse causality and ommited variable bias, a lagged structure, and corrections for panel standard errors. However, we find that the primary driver (of the ‘globesity’ phenomenon) is the ‘social’ rather than the ‘economic’ dimension of globalization, and specifically the effect of changes in ‘information flows’ and ‘social proximity’ on obesity. A one standard deviation increase in social globalization increased the percentage of obese population by 13.7 percent.  aPublisher supplied data 3aenergy intake 3aglobalization 3aobesity 3astatistical analysis 0aI18 0aF69 0aP46 0aGlobalization 0aObesity 0aCalorie intake 0aHealth production 0aSocial globalization 0aEconomic globalization 0aKOF index1 aMas, Núria,0 tFood policy.g2016 Oct., v. 64 p.121-132dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl9768x0306-91927nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodpol.2016.10.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02737naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002400147245014200171300001800313500001900331520153300350592002801883650001501911650001501926650001401941650002001955650001301975650000901988650000701997650001402004650001602018650001302034650001302047650001402060650001602074700002202090700002302112773013502135856004802270852000902318655001202327IND50063429720221121190230.0130325e201303  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006342972DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-012-0984-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShipley, Heather J.10aRemoval of Pb(II), Cd(II), Cu(II), and Zn(II) by hematite nanoparticles: effect of sorbent concentration, pH, temperature, and exhaustion  ap. 1727-1736.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aNanoparticles offer the potential to improve environmental treatment technologies due to their unique properties. Adsorption of metal ions (Pb(II), Cd(II), Cu(II), Zn(II)) to nanohematite was examined as a function of sorbent concentration, pH, temperature, and exhaustion. Adsorption experiments were conducted with 0.05, 0.1, and 0.5 g/L nanoparticles in a pH 8 solution and in spiked San Antonio tap water. The adsorption data showed the ability of nanohematite to remove Pb, Cd, Cu, and Zn species from solution with adsorption increasing as the nanoparticle concentration increased. At 0.5 g/L nanohematite, 100 % Pb species adsorbed, 94 % Cd species adsorbed, 89 % Cu species adsorbed and 100 % Zn species adsorbed. Adsorption kinetics for all metals tested was described by a pseudo second-order rate equation with lead having the fastest rate of adsorption. The effect of temperature on adsorption showed that Pb(II), Cu(II), and Cd(II) underwent an endothermic reaction, while Zn(II) underwent an exothermic reaction. The nanoparticles were able to simultaneously remove multiple metals species (Zn, Cd, Pb, and Cu) from both a pH 8 solution and spiked San Antonio tap water. Exhaustion experiments showed that at pH 8, exhaustion did not occur for the nanoparticles but adsorption does decrease for Cd, Cu, and Zn species but not Pb species. The strong adsorption coupled with the ability to simultaneously remove multiple metal ions offers a potential remediation method for the removal of metals from water.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3aendothermy 3aequations 3aheat production 3ahematite 3alead 3apH 3apollution 3aremediation 3aresearch 3asorbents 3atap water 3atemperature1 aEngates, Karen E.1 aGrover, Valerie A.0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research international.g2013 Mar., v. 20, no. 3 p.1727-1736dSpringer-Verlagx0944-13447nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-012-0984-z  aDNAL 7aarticle03003naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001400151245015700165500002200322520133600344592002801680650001201708650002101720650002501741650003001766650001401796650001601810650001501826650001801841650001601859650001301875650002201888650003801910650001401948650000701962650003001969650001401999650003902013650002502052650001102077650001002088653003002098653001202128653001802140653002302158653001702181700002002198700001702218700001902235700001802254773007102272856008502343852000902428655001202437IND60559599620221121130843.0161216s2016    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055959962DNAL7 a10.1016/j.exppara.2016.12.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aUmair, S.10aMolecular and biochemical characterisation and recognition by the immune host of the enolase of the abomasal nematode parasite Teladorsagia circumcincta  aPre-press version  aA 1299 bp full length cDNA encoding Teladorsagia circumcincta enolase (TeciENO) was cloned, expressed in Escherichia coli and the recombinant protein purified and its kinetic properties determined. Helminth enolase sequences were used to construct a phylogenetic tree. The predicted protein consisted of 433 amino acids and was present as a single band of about 50 kDa on SDS-PAGE. Multiple alignments of the protein sequence of TeciENO with homologues from other helminths showed 98% similarity with Haemonchus contortus enolase, 78–95% similarity to other nematode sequences and 72–75% similarity to cestode and trematode enolases. Substrate binding sites and conserved regions were identified and were completely conserved in other homologues. The optimum pH for TeciENO activity at 25 °C was pH 7, the Km for 2-phophoglycerate 0.09 ± 0.04 mM and the Vmax was 604 ± 6 nmol min−1 mg−1 protein (both mean ± SD, n = 2). TeciENO activity was inhibited by 11.5% by 1 mM citrate (p < 0.001). Antibodies in both serum and saliva from field-immune, but not nematode-naïve, sheep recognised recombinant TeciENO in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. The recognition of the recombinant protein by antibodies generated by exposure of sheep to native enolase indicates similar antigenicity of the two proteins.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCestoda 3aEscherichia coli 3aHaemonchus contortus 3aTeladorsagia circumcincta 3aTrematoda 3aamino acids 3aantibodies 3abinding sites 3ablood serum 3acitrates 3acomplementary DNA 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3ahelminths 3apH 3aphosphopyruvate hydratase 3aphylogeny 3apolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis 3arecombinant proteins 3asaliva 3asheep 0aTeladorsagia circumcincta 0aEnolase 0aGene sequence 0aKinetic properties 0aAntigenicity1 aBouchet, C.L.G.1 aKnight, J.S.1 aPernthaner, A.1 aSimpson, H.V.0 tExperimental parasitology.g2016, dElsevier Inc.x0014-48947nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.exppara.2016.12.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02324naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245010000165300001600265520131500281592002801596650001301624650002101637650001201658650001101670650001401681650001501695650001201710700001901722700001701741700001501758700001801773773009301791856008101884852000901965655001201974IND60466004820221117170320.0151123e201512  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6046600482DNAL7 a10.1007/s13744-015-0324-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCarvalho, A F10aNeotropical Polistinae (Vespidae) and the Progression Rule Principle: the Round-Trip Hypothesis  ap. 596-603.  aThe progression rule principle is based on the relation between centers of origin and basal forms, and the prediction that recently colonized areas are where novelties commonly occur. Using this concept as the null hypothesis, the aim of the present study was to test whether intuitive predictions of this model are confirmed in the Neotropical paper wasps, a group fairly studied through phylogenetic frameworks. The analyses consisted of a careful review of the distribution of different wasps of the subfamily Polistinae with available phylogenies and the association of this information with colonization routes. This procedure allowed the determination of a two-step colonization process in the Neotropical region based on the progression rule principle, for which the round-trip hypothesis is proposed. The first route (east to west) is seen in a small group of Polistes. This route is rare but strengthens the arising of paper wasps in the Americas in a Gondwanan scenario. The second route (west to east) is remarkably repeated in several other lineages. Thus, the northwestern Neotropics, mainly Amazon Forest, is proposed as the major center of origins for living Neotropical Polistinae and the round-trip hypothesis may explain both earlier and later colonization routes of the paper wasps analyzed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPolistes 3acenter of origin 3aforests 3amodels 3aphylogeny 3aprediction 3atropics1 aMenezes, R S T1 aSomavilla, A1 aCosta, M A1 aDel Lama, M A0 tNeotropical entomology.g2015 Dec., v. 44, no. 6 p.596-603dSpringer USx1519-566X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13744-015-0324-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02402naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002500150245012200175300001800297520122500315592002801540650002201568650001301590650001301603650001401616650000901630650001801639650001301657650003701670700001801707700002401725700005901749700002001808773011901828856008401947852000902031655001202040IND60634932220190422000000.0190326e20190313xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063493222DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.macromol.8b023502doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlizadehaghdam, Mina10aThermodynamic Features of Perfectly Crystalline Poly(3-hexylthiophene) Revealed through Studies of Imperfect Crystals  ap. 2487-2494.  aA reliable value for the enthalpy of fusion of a perfect poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) crystal (ΔHₘ°) is still in doubt. In the published works, ΔHₘ° ranging from 33 to 50 J/g, obtained from measuring the dependence of the heat of fusion on crystallinity and crystal thickness, based on the Mandelkern relation, is in clear contradiction to ΔHₘ° = 99 J/g, resulting from measuring melting point depression of P3HT crystals in the polymer–diluent mixtures, based on the Flory relation. In this work, we satisfied a requisite of the Flory equation, ignored in the literature, by presenting a new conception as the “dry melting temperature”. We confirmed that the correct value for the melting temperature of the undiluted polymer to use in the equation is the “dry melting temperature” of the P3HT crystals prepared in the presence of the diluent and not the melting temperature of those prepared in the absence of the diluent. We also employed UV–vis spectroscopy along with a Franck–Condon analysis to determine crystallinity of the P3HT samples and revealed that the ΔHₘ° obtained by the Mandelkern approach (76 ± 5 J/g) could support that concluded from the Flory approach (74 ± 4 J/g).  aPublisher supplied data 3acrystal structure 3acrystals 3aenthalpy 3aequations 3aheat 3amelting point 3apolymers 3aultraviolet-visible spectroscopy1 aHeck, Barbara1 aSiegenführ, Silvia1 aAbbasi, Farhang1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9770-42551 aReiter, Günter0 tMacromolecules.g2019 Mar. 13, v. 52, no. 6 p.2487-2494dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23616x1520-58357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.macromol.8b023503Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02942naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001600152245008000168300001600248520174500264592002802009650002802037650002502065650002302090650001202113650002102125650001502146650001602161650002402177650002202201650002102223650001502244650001302259650002102272700001902293700001902312700002502331773011202356856005502468852000902523655001202532IND4467111520221118021424.0120418e201204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446711152DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1745-4514.2010.00524.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Wei,10aFermentation of group b soyasaponins with probiotic lactobacillus rhamnosus  ap. 179-188.  aLactic acid fermentation of a group B oleanane triterpene saponin extract with Lactobacillus rhamnosus enzyme preparations changed the typical soyasaponin phytochemical profile. After 60 h, 2,3‐dihydro‐2,5‐dihydroxy‐6‐methyl‐4H‐pyran‐4‐one (DDMP)‐conjugated saponins were reduced and soyasaponins I, III and the group B soyasaponin aglycone were increased. A novel metabolite was detected high performance liquid chromatography‐electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (HPLC‐MS‐ESI) with a molecular weight of 254. Specifically, DDMP saponins (βg, βa, γg, γa) were reduced after 1 h and soyasaponin βg and γa reduced to trace levels at 1 h and βa at 24 h while γg was significantly (P < 0.05) reduced with a percentage reduction of 64.1% at 60 h. Soyasaponin I significantly (P < 0.05) increased after 1 h of fermentation and reached a maximum concentration of 10.39 ± 0.13 µg/mL after 24 h, a percentage increase of 66.5%. Soyasaponin III was also significantly (P < 0.05) increased by 36.8% at 24 h compared to no fermentation. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: This work describes the behavior of a bioactive classes of compounds found in soy and related products. Soyasaponin are structurally diverse group of compounds and the relative bioactivity has been shown to be dependent on chemical structure. This manuscript provides evidence that lactic acid bacterial enzyme preparations can modify the phytochemical profile with the potential to change the biological response of soyasaponins. The results presented herein would be interest for those interested in developing novel soy‐based products and those interested in the nutraceutical and functional foods disciplines.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLactobacillus rhamnosus 3abioactive properties 3achemical structure 3aenzymes 3afunctional foods 3aionization 3alactic acid 3alactic fermentation 3amass spectrometry 3amolecular weight 3aprobiotics 3asaponins 3asoybean products1 aTANG, FANG YIN1 aYEO, MEI CHING1 aPOPOVICH, DAVID GLEN0 tJournal of food biochemistry.g2012 Apr., v. 36, no. 2 p.179-188dBlackwell Publishing Incx0145-88847nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1745-4514.2010.00524.x  aDNAL 7aarticle01535naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001600140245004800156300001600204520072100220592002800941650001200969650001200981650002500993650000901018700001601027773013001043856007501173852000901248655001201257IND60764736120221119041404.0220409e20190522xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076473612DNAL7 a10.17221/11919-jfs2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKolenka, I.14aThe financing of non-market forest services  ap. 508-511.  aThe article deals with issues of non-market forest services. There is a persistent issue complicating the quantification of adequate subsidy to forest owners – non-existence of market with such forest services. Forest services financing can be made objective by implementation of the following steps: 1. Earmarking of non-market forest services that are becoming market subjects gradually. 2. Earmarking of non-market forest services that create a secondary product of wood production function. 3. Quantification of demand for services. 4. Quantification of costs necessary to cover the demand for those forest services. 5. Quantification of losses caused to forest owners by restricting their economic activities.  aPublisher supplied data 3aforests 3amarkets 3aproduction functions 3awood1 aPulkrab, K.0 tJournal of Forest Science.g, v. 48, no. 11 p.508-511dCzech Academy of Agricultural ScienceswJournal:21419x1212-48347nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.17221/11919-jfs3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03337naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002200151245014300173300001400316520155400330592002801884650002501912650001501937650001001952650002401962650001701986650002802003650001502031650001802046650000902064650001602073650001002089650001802099650001802117650000902135650003302144650003702177650002602214650001402240650000902254650001502263653002802278653001202306653002302318653001602341653002002357653000802377700001602385700001702401700001602418700002402434700001802458700002902476700002302505773010002528856008602628852000902714655001202723IND60535902820221123042829.0190318e201505  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053590282DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aquatox.2015.03.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBhuvaneshwari, M.10aCytotoxicity of ZnO NPs towards fresh water algae Scenedesmus obliquus at low exposure concentrations in UV-C, visible and dark conditions  ap. 29-38.  aContinuous increase in the usage of ZnO nanoparticles in commercial products has exacerbated the risk of release of these particles into the aquatic environment with possible harmful effects on the biota. In the current study, cytotoxic effects of two types of ZnO nanoparticles, having different initial effective diameters in filtered and sterilized lake water medium [487.5±2.55nm for ZnO-1 NPs and 616.2±38.5nm for ZnO-2 NPs] were evaluated towards a dominant freshwater algal isolate Scenedesmus obliquus in UV-C, visible and dark conditions at three exposure concentrations: 0.25, 0.5 and 1mg/L. The toxic effects were found to be strongly dependent on the initial hydrodynamic particle size in the medium, the exposure concentrations and the irradiation conditions. The loss in viability, LDH release and ROS generation were significantly enhanced in the case of the smaller sized ZnO-1 NPs than in the case of ZnO-2 NPs under comparable test conditions. The toxicity of both types of ZnO NPs was considerably elevated under UV-C irradiation in comparison to that in dark and visible light conditions, the effects being more enhanced in case of ZnO-1 NPs. The size dependent dissolution of the ZnO NPs in the test medium and possible toxicity due to the released Zn2+ ions was also noted. The surface adsorption of the nanoparticles was substantiated by scanning electron microscopy. The internalization/uptake of the NPs by the algal cells was confirmed by fluorescence microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, and elemental analyses.  aPublisher supplied data 3aScenedesmus obliquus 3aadsorption 3aalgae 3aaquatic environment 3acytotoxicity 3afluorescence microscopy 3afreshwater 3ahydrodynamics 3aions 3airradiation 3alakes 3ananoparticles 3aparticle size 3arisk 3ascanning electron microscopy 3atransmission electron microscopy 3aultraviolet radiation 3aviability 3azinc 3azinc oxide 0aEffective particle size 0aZnO NPs 0aExposure condition 0aDissolution 0aInternalization 0aROS1 aIswarya, V.1 aArchanaa, S.1 aMadhu, G.M.1 aKumar, G.K.

The mechanism of action by which bifenthrin alters 17β-estradiol (E2) is unclear. E2 biosynthesis is regulated through pituitary follicle stimulating hormone, which is directly controlled by hypothalamic gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH2). Since dopaminergic signaling significantly influences GnRH2 release in fish, the goal of the study was to determine the effect of a 96h and 2 weeks exposure to bifenthrin on dopaminergic signaling in juvenile rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) (RT). Our results indicated that a decrease in dopamine receptor 2A (DR2A) expression was associated with a trend toward an increase in plasma E2 following exposure at 96h and 2 weeks, and a significant increase in the relative expression of vitellogenin mRNA at 2 weeks. DR2A mRNA expression decreased 426-fold at 96h and 269-fold at 2 weeks in the brains of 1.5ppb (3.55pM) bifenthrin treated RT. There was an increase in tyrosine hydroxylase transcript levels at 96h, which is indicative of dopamine production in the brains of the 1.5ppb (3.55pM) bifenthrin treated RT. A significant increase in the relative expression of GnRH2 was observed at 96h but a significant decrease was noted after 2 weeks exposure indicating potential feedback loop activation. These results indicate that the estrogenic-effects of bifenthrin may result in part from changes in signaling within the dopaminergic pathway, but that other feedback pathways may also be involved.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOncorhynchus mykiss 3abifenthrin 3abiosynthesis 3adopamine 3adopamine receptors 3aestradiol 3afish 3afollicle-stimulating hormone 3agene expression 3agonadotropin-releasing hormone 3ajuveniles 3amechanism of action 3amessenger RNA 3amodels 3apyrethrins 3atyrosine 3-monooxygenase 3avitellogenin 0aBifenthin 0aDopamine 0a17β 0a-estradiol (E2) 0aGonadotropin releasing hormone1 aSchlenk, Daniel0 tAquatic toxicology.g2015 May, v. 162 p.66-72dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl33163x0166-445X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquatox.2015.03.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02001naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094024002200132024001900154040001800173100001900191245009600210300001500306506007600321520077400397592002801171506003701199650001301236650001601249650002001265650001001285650002101295650002901316650002401345650001301369700005601382773009601438856008401534852000901618655001201627IND60553619420221207131326.0161021e201408  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055361942DNAL7 a10.1016/j.copbio.2014.01.0012doi7 aPMC41119642pmcid7 a244955122pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKlumpp, Stefan10aBacterial growth: global effects on gene expression, growth feedback and proteome partition  ap. 96-102.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe function of endogenous as well as synthetic genetic circuits is generically coupled to the physiological state of the cell. For exponentially growing bacteria, a key characteristic of the state of the cell is the growth rate and thus gene expression is often growth-rate dependent. Here we review recent results on growth-rate dependent gene expression. We distinguish different types of growth-rate dependencies by the mechanisms of regulation involved and the presence or absence of an effect of the gene product on growth. The latter can lead to growth feedback, feedback mediated by changes of the global state of the cell. Moreover, we discuss how growth rate dependence can be used as a guide to study the molecular implementation of physiological regulation.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abacteria 3acell growth 3agene expression 3agenes 3amicrobial growth 3aphysiological regulation 3aphysiological state 3aproteome1 aHwa, Terence1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1837-68420 tCurrent opinion in biotechnology.g2014 Aug., v. 28 p.96-102dElsevier Ltdx0958-16697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.copbio.2014.01.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01935naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002100143245030400164300001800468520059100486592002801077650000801105650001301113650001101126650001301137650001201150650001201162650001001174650001101184650001101195653002501206653003401231653003101265653002601296773015301322856007701475852000901552655001201561IND60521572120221120120238.0160530e20140602xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052157212DNAL7 a10.1515/znb-1979-10112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKläui, Wolfgang10a[(C5H5)CO{P(0)(0C2H5)2}3]-: Eine einfache Synthese eines metallorganischen Tripodliganden und seine Reaktivität gegenüber den Kationen der III.

Wild-type Arabidopsis Col0 and asn2-1 mutant were grown for one month by hydroponic culture and subjected to 100 mM NaCl stress for a short time from 6 to 24 h. The salt treatment decreased chlorophyll and soluble protein contents, and increased ammonium level in the asn2-1 leaves. The salinity induced ASN1 mRNA level in the wild-type and asn2-1 leaves. By contrast, the salt treatment inhibited the transcript and protein levels of chloroplastic glutamine synthetase 2 (GS2, EC 6.3.1.2) in the wild-type and asn2-1 leaves. Increase in asparagine and proline contents in response to the salt treatment provides evidence for the role of asparagine as a prevailing stress responding amino acid. Glutamate dehydrogenase (NADH-GDH, EC 1.4.1.2) exhibited a slight increase in the α-subunit and β-subunit in the wild-type line and the asn2-1 line, respectively under the salinity, whereas its in vitro aminating activity in the wild-type leaves was not affected. The results indicate that the asn2-1 mutant was impaired in nitrogen assimilation and translocation under salt treatment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArabidopsis 3aammonium 3aasparagine 3aasparagine synthase (glutamine-hydrolysing) 3aaspartate-ammonia ligase 3achlorophyll 3agene expression 3agenes 3aglutamate dehydrogenase 3aglutamate-ammonia ligase 3ahydroponics 3amutants 3anitrogen 3aplant physiology 3aproline 3asalinity 3asalt stress 3asalt tolerance 3astress tolerance1 aDebouba, Mohamed1 aGaufichon, Laure1 aClément, Gilles,1 aGouia, Houda1 aHajjaji, Afef1 aSuzuki, Akira0 tPlant physiology and biochemistry.g2011 June, v. 49, no. 6 p.623-628dElsevier Masson SASx0981-94287nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.plaphy.2011.03.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04669naa a2200685 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002500151245016300176300001400339520259800353592002802951650002202979650001903001650001403020650002403034650002203058650001503080650002903095650002103124650001403145650001603159650001703175650001603192650001503208650001503223650001603238650001303254650001603267650001003283650001203293650001803305650002103323650002703344650001503371650001703386650002003403650002503423650001603448650001103464650000903475650001503484653002003499653001403519653001903533653001503552653001803567653002603585700002203611700001903633700006503652700005903717773010003776856008603876852000903962655001203971IND60535903020221120051038.0190318e201505  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053590302DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aquatox.2015.03.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFalfushynska, Halina14aThe effects of zinc nanooxide on cellular stress responses of the freshwater mussels Unio tumidus are modulated by elevated temperature and organic pollutants  ap. 82-93.  aNanoparticle toxicity is a growing concern in freshwater habitats. However, understanding of the nanoparticle effects on aquatic organisms is impeded by the lack of the studies of the nanoparticles effects in the environmentally relevant context of multiple stress exposures. Zinc oxide nanoparticles (n-ZnO) are widely used metal-based nanoparticles in electronics and personal care products that accumulate in aquatic environments from multiple non-point sources. In this study, we evaluated the effects of n-ZnO in a model organism, a mussel Unio tumidus, and the potential modulation of these effects by common co-occurring environmental stressors. Male U. tumidus were exposed for 14 days to n-ZnO (3.1μM), Zn2+ (3.1μM), Ca-channel blocker nifedipine (Nfd 10μM), combinations of n-ZnO and Nfd or n-ZnO and thiocarbamate fungicide Tattoo (Ta, 91μgL−1) at 18°C, and n-ZnO at 25°C (n-ZnO+t°). Total and metallothionein-bound Zn levels as well as levels of metallothioneins (MT), cellular stress responses and cytotoxicity biomarkers were assessed in the mussels. The key biomarkers that showed differential responses to different single and combined stressors in this study were activities of caspase-3 and lysosomal cathepsin D, as well as protein carbonyl content. At 18°C, exposures to n-ZnO, organic pollutants and their combinations led to a prominent up-regulation of MT levels (by ∼30%) and oxidative stress response including up-regulation of superoxide dismutase activity, an increase in oxyradical production, and a 2–3-fold decrease in the levels of protein carbonyls in all exposures except nZnO+Ta. Expos ure to n-ZnO in the absence of other stressors also led to a strong (∼7-fold) elevation of cathepsin D activity. Cellular responses to Zn2+ and n-ZnO were different indicating that n-ZnO was not due exclusively to Zn release. Ca-channel blocker Nfd affected intracellular Zn distribution (reflected in the prominent elevation of Zn-MT levels) and caused reductive stress indicated by elevated levels of reduced glutathione levels and an increase in lactate/pyruvate ratio (reflecting higher NADH/NAD ratio). Elevated temperature (25°C) abolished most of the typical responses to n-ZnO and induced oxidative injury, DNA fragmentation and caspase-3 mediated apoptosis in n-ZnO-exposed mussels. DNA fragmentation was also induced by exposure to organic toxins (alone and in combination with n-ZnO) but not by n-ZnO alone. These data indicate that n-ZnO toxicity to freshwater organisms is modulated by organic pollutants and enhanced by elevated temperatures.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA fragmentation 3aNAD (coenzyme) 3aapoptosis 3aaquatic environment 3aaquatic organisms 3abiomarkers 3acalcium channel blockers 3acalcium channels 3acaspase-3 3acathepsin D 3acytotoxicity 3aelectronics 3afreshwater 3afungicides 3aglutathione 3ahabitats 3alactic acid 3amales 3amussels 3ananoparticles 3aoxidative stress 3apersonal care products 3apollutants 3apyruvic acid 3astress response 3asuperoxide dismutase 3atemperature 3atoxins 3azinc 3azinc oxide 0aMetallothionein 0aApoptosis 0aZinc nanooxide 0aNifedipine 0aThiocarbamate 0aStressor interactions1 aGnatyshyna, Lesya1 aYurchak, Irina1 aSokolova, I.q(Inna),1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2068-43021 aStoliar, Oksana1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8579-28810 tAquatic toxicology.g2015 May, v. 162 p.82-93dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl33163x0166-445X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquatox.2015.03.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02348naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002200151245014500173300001600318520103000334592002801364650002201392650002501414650001801439650001001457650001501467650001801482650002801500650000901528650000901537650001301546653001501559653001901574653001401593653001501607653001801622700002401640700002201664700001901686773011401705856008601819852000901905655001201914IND60542850720221116161000.0190408e201409  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054285072DNAL7 a10.1016/j.indcrop.2014.05.0482doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBenchikh, Yassine10aChanges in bioactive phytochemical content and in vitro antioxidant activity of carob (Ceratonia siliqua L.) as influenced by fruit ripening  ap. 298-303.  aIn the present study, three varieties (Wild, Fleshy and Sisam) of carob (Ceratonia siliqua L.) pods were analyzed for their bioactive phytochemical content and antioxidant activities (AA) at three ripening stages. The results showed that the samples have the highest total phenolic (TPC), total flavonoid (TFC) and ascorbic acid content (AAC) in the unripe stage. The antioxidant activity examined using free radical scavenging effect against 2-2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH), ferric reducing power (FRP) and ferrous iron chelating (FIC) assays decreased significantly throughout the ripening. Extremely significant correlations (p<0.001) were found between phytochemical compound contents (TPC, TFC and AAC) and assessed antioxidant activities, except between AAC and FIC where just a very significant correlation (p<0.01) was recorded. Our data revealed that extracts of unripe C. siliqua L. are an excellent source of natural antioxidants that might be more widely used in cosmetic, pharmaceutical and food industries.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCeratonia siliqua 3aantioxidant activity 3aascorbic acid 3acarob 3aflavonoids 3afood industry 3afree radical scavengers 3airon 3apods 3aripening 0aCarob pulp 0aRipening stage 0aPhenolics 0aFlavonoids 0aAscorbic acid1 aLouaileche, Hayette1 aGeorge, Beatrice,1 aMerlin, André0 tIndustrial crops and products.g2014 Sept., v. 60 p.298-303dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl49222x0926-66907nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.indcrop.2014.05.0483Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03741naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001800145245014400163300001800307500001900325520244400344592002802788650001002816650001502826650002602841650001002867650001002877650003402887650001202921650001402933650001302947650002002960650001202980651001502992651001403007700002003021700002303041700003003064700002103094773013503115856004803250852000903298655001203307IND6037096920221121190315.0210804e201111  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND603709692DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-011-0501-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRüdel, Heinz10aSurvey of patterns, levels, and trends of perfluorinated compounds in aquatic organisms and bird eggs from representative German ecosystems  ap. 1457-1470.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aPURPOSE: Samples from the German Environmental Specimen Bank (ESB) covering particularly the years 1994–1996, 2000–2002, and 2006–2009 were analyzed for perfluorinated compounds (PFC; mainly C4–C13 carboxylic and sulfonic acids) to gain an overview on current PFC levels and patterns in marine, limnetic, and terrestrial biota; to assess their concentrations in different trophic levels; and to investigate whether risk management measures for PFC are successful. METHODS: Specimens, either standardized annual pooled samples (blue mussels, eelpout liver, bream liver, pigeon eggs) or individual single samples (cormorant eggs, rook eggs), were collected for the German ESB program from representative sampling sites according to documented guidelines. After appropriate extraction, PFC were quantified under ISO/IEC 17025 accreditation by HPLC/MS-MS with isotopically labeled internal standards. Limits of quantification (LOQs) were 0.2–0.5 ng/g. Data are reported on a wet weight basis. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: In most samples the predominant PFC was perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS). However, in marine mussels from North and Baltic Seas, PFOS levels were mostly below the LOQ, but low residues of PFOS amide were found which declined in recent years. Livers of eelpout showed maximum concentrations of 15–25 ng/g PFOS in the period 2000–2002 and low amounts of perfluoropentanoate in all years. Beside PFOS (median 48 ng/g) several PFC could be determined in cormorant eggs sampled in 2009 from a Baltic Sea site. For a freshwater ecosystem, current PFC burdens for cormorant eggs were even higher (median 400 ng/g PFOS). Livers of bream from rivers showed concentrations of 130–260 ng/g PFOS, but for bream from a reference lake levels were only about 6 ng/g. In contrast to cormorants, eggs of rook and feral pigeon from terrestrial ecosystems displayed only low PFC burdens (up to 6 ng/g PFOS). CONCLUSIONS: Generally, PFC levels were lower in marine than in freshwater biota. PFC burdens were higher in biota from the ESB-North Sea sites than in Baltic Sea organisms. Levels of PFC were quite high especially in top predators of both limnetic and marine ecosystems. Only low PFC levels were detected in eggs of terrestrial birds. A decrease of PFOS levels from maximum values around the year 2000 observed at least in North Sea biota may be a result of a production cease and shifts in marketing pattern.  aPublisher supplied data 3abream 3afreshwater 3afreshwater ecosystems 3alakes 3aliver 3aperfluorooctane sulfonic acid 3apigeons 3apollution 3aresearch 3arisk management 3asurveys 3aBaltic Sea 3aNorth Sea1 aMüller, Josef,1 aJürling, Heinrich1 aBartel-Steinbach, Martina1 aKoschorreck, Jan0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research international.g2011 Nov., v. 18, no. 9 p.1457-1470dSpringer-Verlagx0944-13447nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-011-0501-9  aDNAL 7aarticle02245naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100005500150245014300205300001800348520117800366592002801544650002301572650001701595650001601612650001101628650001301639650001501652650001101667650001601678650001301694773011901707856008401826852000901910655001201919IND60634932720221123013051.0190326e20190311xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063493272DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.macromol.8b024852doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMead, D.

The new model using the independent alignment approximation (IAA) successfully predicts the effective modulus (Mooney ratio) in uniaxial extension and compression with accuracy nearly equal to the nonaffine slip tube model of Rubinstein and Panyukov. However, unlike the nonaffine slip tube model of Rubinstein and Panyukov, our Doi–Edwards IAA rubber model can be simply extended to arbitrary deformation types as well as make theoretical predictions for the fourth moment of the segmental orientation distribution function in general uniaxial deformations which is relevant to polarized Raman scattering experiments. We demonstrate this capability explicitly. The new Doi–Edwards rubber model demonstrates that there are apparently other, simpler, essentially ad hoc means to address the effects and character of the trapped topological entanglements in elastomers at moderate and high strains than the much more complex nonaffine slip tube model.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRaman spectroscopy 3acrosslinking 3adeformation 3amodels 3apolymers 3aprediction 3arubber 3aterminology 3atopology0 tMacromolecules.g2019 Mar. 11, v. 52, no. 6 p.2349-2360dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23616x1520-58357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.macromol.8b024853Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02296naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001900143245025000162300001800412520095800430592002801388650001601416650001701432650002001449650001801469650001201487650001301499650001501512650004401527653004501571653003101616653001101647700002001658700001801678773014001696856007701836852000901913655001201922IND60521572420221120131101.0160530e20140602xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052157242DNAL7 a10.1515/znb-1979-10142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBrunner, Henri10aOptisch aktive Übergangsmetall-Komplexe, LXIII [1] Asymmetrische Induktion in C5H5Mo(CO)2LX-Diastereomeren-Gleichgewichten / Optically Active Transition Metal Complexes, LXIII [1] Asymmetrie Induction in C5H5Mo(CO)2LX Diastereoisomer Equilibria  ap. 1418-1423.  aThe thioamidato complexes C₅H₅(CO)₂MoSC(R)NCH(CH₃) (Ar), derived from acetic acid R = CH₃ and benzoic acid R = C₆H₅, were prepared and characterized. The diastereo-isomers, differing in their ¹H NMR spectra, were partly separated by fractional crystallization. After equilibration with respect to the labile Mo configuration the diastereoisomer ratio, a measure for the asymmetric induction from the chiral ligand on the formation of the two Mo configurations at equilibrium, was determined by ¹H NMR integration. The asymmetric induction is very high for Ar = o-tolyl [76% (R = C₆H₃) and 84% (R = C₆H₅)] compared to Ar = phenyl [48% (R = CH₃) and 56% (R = C₆H₅)] and Ar = m-and p-tolyl [52 and 44% (R = CH₃)]. The (CO)₃Cr complexed phenyl substituent with only 10% asymmetric induction does not show the β-phenyl effect, a weak attraction between aryl groups in β-position to the metal atom and the MC₅H₅ moiety.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetic acid 3abenzoic acid 3acrystallization 3adiastereomers 3aligands 3amoieties 3amolybdenum 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 0aChiral Organo-Transition Metal Complexes 0aLabile Metal Configuration 0a1H NMR1 aBauer, Isabella1 aLukas, Rainer0 tZeitschrift für Naturforschung B.g2014 June 2, v. 34, no. 10 p.1418-1423dVerlag der Zeitschrift für Naturforschungx1865-71177nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1515/znb-1979-10143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04494naa a2200673 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002100151245017000172300001600342520241100358592002802769650001202797650002002809650002002829650001702849650001502866650002202881650001302903650002102916650001802937650001002955650002002965650002702985650002803012650003603040650003603076650002303112650002203135650002003157650001203177650002103189650002603210650001403236650003703250650002003287650002503307650001203332651001103344653002503355653002203380653002903402653001103431653002103442653002503463653001703488700002103505700002503526700002203551700001803573700002003591773010203611856008603713852000903799655001203808IND60535903220221120043832.0190318e201505  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053590322DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aquatox.2015.03.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLacroix, Camille10aActive and passive biomonitoring suggest metabolic adaptation in blue mussels (Mytilus spp.) chronically exposed to a moderate contamination in Brest harbor (France)  ap. 126-137.  aBrest harbor (Bay of Brest, Brittany, France) has a severe past of anthropogenic chemical contamination, but inputs tended to decrease, indicating a reassessment of its ecotoxicological status should be carried out. Here, native and caged mussels (Mytilus spp.) were used in combination to evaluate biological effects of chronic chemical contamination in Brest harbor. Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) contamination was measured in mussel tissues as a proxy of harbor and urban pollution. Biochemical biomarkers of xenobiotic biotransformation, antioxidant defenses, generation of reducing equivalents, energy metabolism and oxidative damage were studied in both gills and digestive glands of native and caged mussels. In particular, activities of glutathione-S-transferase (GST), superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), glutathione reductase (GR), NADP-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDP), pyruvate kinase (PK) and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) were measured and lipid peroxidation was assessed by malondialdehyde (MDA) quantification. In addition, a condition index was calculated to assess the overall health of the mussels. Moderate PAH contamination was detected in digestive glands of both native and caged individuals from the exposed site. Modulations of biomarkers were detected in digestive glands of native harbor mussels indicating the presence of a chemical pressure. In particular, results suggested increased biotransformation (GST), antioxidant defenses (CAT), NADPH generation (IDP) and gluconeogenesis (PEPCK), which could represent a coordinated response against chemically-induced cellular stress. Lipid peroxidation assessment and condition index indicated an absence of acute stress in the same mussels suggesting metabolic changes could, at least partially, offset the negative effects of contamination. In caged mussels, only GR was found modulated compared to non-exposed mussels but significant differences in oxidative stress and energy-related biomarkers were observed compared to native harbor mussels. Overall, these results suggested mussels chronically exposed to contamination have set up metabolic adaptation, which may contribute to their survival in the moderately contaminated harbor of Brest. Whether these adaptive traits result from phenotypic plasticity or genetic adaptation needs to be further investigated.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMytilus 3aNADP (coenzyme) 3aadverse effects 3aantioxidants 3abiomarkers 3abiotransformation 3acatalase 3achronic exposure 3aecotoxicology 3agills 3agluconeogenesis 3aglutathione peroxidase 3aglutathione transferase 3aglutathione-disulfide reductase 3aisocitrate dehydrogenase (NADP) 3alipid peroxidation 3along term effects 3amalondialdehyde 3amussels 3aoxidative stress 3aphenotypic plasticity 3apollution 3apolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons 3apyruvate kinase 3asuperoxide dismutase 3atissues 3aFrance 0aMarine biomonitoring 0aChronic pollution 0aBlue mussel Mytilus spp. 0aCaging 0aOxidative stress 0aEnergetic metabolism 0aBay of Brest1 aRichard, Gaëlle1 aSeguineau, Catherine1 aGuyomarch, Julien1 aMoraga, Dario1 aAuffret, Michel0 tAquatic toxicology.g2015 May, v. 162 p.126-137dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl33163x0166-445X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquatox.2015.03.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02450naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245018000169520097000349592002801319650001601347650001201363650001601375650002601391650003301417650001101450650001201461650001201473650001601485650001701501650000901518700005901527700002101586700002301607700006101630700002201691700002201713700005701735700001801792773011101810856008601921852000902007655001202016IND60746688420221120175340.0210911e202112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074668842DNAL7 a10.1016/j.idairyj.2021.1051742doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLanza, Ilaria10aUse of GC–MS and 1H NMR low-level data fusion as an advanced and comprehensive metabolomic approach to discriminate milk from dairy chains based on different types of forage  aAs forage may affect the environmental sustainability of a given dairy chain, this study evaluated the discriminant capacity of fatty acids (FAs) and NMR metabolomic profiles of milk from three dairy chains, where forage components of cows diets were: maize silage (MS), grass-legume and maize silage (GMS), grass and lucerne hay (HAY). Canonical discriminant analysis (CDA) based on FAs and NMR metabolites highlighted a reliable discriminative performance for HAY samples that were correctly recognised, especially on the basis of C18:3n-3 and C17:0. The GMS samples were positively correlated with choline, C14:0 and C17:1 cis-9, while the MS ones were represented mainly by C16:1 cis-9. An overlap between MS and GMS samples was observed, even if a low-level fused CDA modelling improved their correct assignment.

In this study, main-chain type polyazobenzenes bearing chiral substituents in the side-chain are synthesized by the Suzuki–Miyaura coupling method. The chiral aggregation process of main-chain type polyazobenzene is investigated. Then, intermolecular interaction of these polymers allows the formation of chiral aggregates as higher order structures. Trans-to-cis photoisomerization of the polymers was confirmed with in situ UV–vis absorption spectra. Development of π-conjugation in the backbone can be an important factor in the design of main-chain type azobenzene polymers. In addition, we induced light-driven changes in the chiroptical activity. The microstructure of the polymers is examined with synchrotron radiation X-ray diffraction and a technique to define “chiral photochromism”.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSuzuki reaction 3aX-ray diffraction 3achemical interactions 3amicrostructure 3aoptical properties 3aphotoisomerization 3apolymers 3aultraviolet-visible spectroscopy1 aKumai, Reiji1 aSagayama, Hajime1 aGoto, Hiromasa1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4276-735X0 tMacromolecules.g2019 Mar. 11, v. 52, no. 6 p.2340-2348dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23616x1520-58357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.macromol.8b025883Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02678naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100005800153245007200211520121800283592002801501650001201529650001901541650002201560650001801582650001101600650002601611653001301637653003001650653003001680653002001710653001901730653002801749653002701777653003101804700002001835700002101855700002001876700001901896700002901915700002101944700002101965700001801986773010702004856008802111852000902199655001202208IND60746688520221120175357.0220205e202109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074668852DNAL7 a10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2021.1023222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVesely, Stepan1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9056-536810aClimate change action as a project of identity: Eight meta-analyses  aIdentity can improve our understanding of personal climate action, particularly when climate action becomes an expression of a person’s self. However, it is unclear which kind of self or identity is most relevant. Building on a comprehensive series of eight meta-analyses (using data from 188 published articles, N = 414,282 participants) this research systematically compares how strongly climate-friendly intentions and behaviors are associated with place identity, personal connectedness to nature, environmental self-identity (i.e., personal self-definition as a pro-environmentally acting person), and social identity (i.e., identification with social groups). Results suggest robust, medium-sized to strong links of both pro-environmental intentions and behaviors to people’s nature connectedness (r = 0.44/0.52), environmental self-identity (r = 0.62/0.56), and identification with groups considered to support climate-friendly behavior (r = 0.48/0.51), but markedly weaker effects for identification with groups which are unrelated to environmental topics (r = 0.30/0.15) and for place identity (r = 0.18/0.32).

Its primary objective was the quality enhancement of canned Atlantic mackerel (Scomber scombrus) by including an aqueous Bifurcaria bifurcata extract in the packing medium. Various alga extract concentrations were tested and compared with a control without alga extract. After 3 months of canned storage, the cans were opened and quality changes in fish white muscle were analyzed. RESULTS: An inhibitory effect on lipid oxidation development (tertiary compound formation) and color parameter (L* and b*) values was observed as a result of the alga presence in the packing medium. On the contrary, the presence of the alga extract did not produce any effect on volatile compound (total and trimethylamine) formation and lipid hydrolysis (free fatty acid formation) development. CONCLUSION: A preservative effect derived from the use of an aqueous B. bifurcata extract as packing medium is concluded, and this result is primarily linked to the presence of hydrophilic preservative molecules. The packing system proposed in this work constitutes a novel and promising strategy to enhance the quality of commercial canned fish products. © 2018 Society of Chemical Industry  aPublisher supplied data 3aBifurcaria bifurcata 3aScomber scombrus 3aalgae 3acanned fish 3acans 3acolor 3afish 3afree fatty acids 3ahydrolysis 3ahydrophilicity 3alipid peroxidation 3alipids 3amuscles 3atrimethylamine 3avolatile compounds1 aTrigo, Marcos1 aFett, Roseane1 aAubourg, Santiago P1http://orcid.org/0000-0002-3136-81370 tJournal of the science of food and agriculture.g2018 July, v. 98, no. 9 p.3462-3467dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl48536x0022-51427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jsfa.88613Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02229naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002300147245019800170300001600368520098200384592002801366650001501394650000901409650001201418650001101430650001601441650001001457650002001467650001601487650002701503650001501530650002701545650001901572650002001591650002501611650001201636773009301648856008101741852000901822655001201831IND60466006020221123023436.0151123e201512  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6046600602DNAL7 a10.1007/s13744-015-0326-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFrías-Lasserre, D10aEffects of Female fruit-marking Pheromones on Oviposition, Mating, and Male Behavior in the Neotropical Species Rhagoletis conversa Bréthes and Rhagoletis brncici Frías (Diptera: Tephritidae)  ap. 560-564.  aSex pheromones produced by females of Rhagoletis conversa Bréthes and Rhagoletis brncici Frías are deposited on the surface of fruits after the eggs are laid. These pheromones repel other females, preventing repeated oviposition on the same fruit. They also attract males, thus assisting mating. Observations were made on wild populations, and cross-species behavioral tests were performed on males. The pheromone released by females was significantly more attractive for males of the same species. The two species showed remarkable differences in mating behavior, in the duration of oviposition, and in the number of circuits made around the fruit after eggs were laid. A morphological analysis of flies collected from their respective host plants indicated great host fidelity and the reproductive isolation of the two species. Possibly, the specific male-arresting effect of this pheromone was important for the sympatric speciation and evolution of these sibling species.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRhagoletis 3aeggs 3afemales 3afruits 3ahost plants 3amales 3amating behavior 3aoviposition 3aoviposition pheromones 3apopulation 3areproductive isolation 3asex pheromones 3asibling species 3asympatric speciation 3atropics0 tNeotropical entomology.g2015 Dec., v. 44, no. 6 p.560-564dSpringer USx1519-566X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13744-015-0326-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02519naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001400139245011000153300001800263520132700281592002801608650001701636650001801653650001501671650002001686650001501706650003501721650001301756650000901769650001101778650001801789650001801807700001601825700001701841700001801858700001601876773014601892856007402038852000902112655001202121IND60764736820221119041241.0220409e20080630xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076473682DNAL7 a10.17221/1193-swr2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMerta, M.10aAnalysis of land use change in the Eastern Ore Mts. regarding both nature protection and flood prevention  ap. S105-S115.  aTwo different models (WBS FLAB, WaSiM-ETH) were used in the project HochNatur (flood prevention and nature conservation in the Weißeritz catchment in the Eastern Ore Mts. – Erzgebirge) to determine risk areas with quick runoff processes and to simulate the discharge. It was done in different scales, in the mesoscale Weißeritz catchment as well as two selected subcatchments with different natural and urban conditions, the Weißbach subcatchment with a well-structured landscape, the Höckenbach subcatchment with a greater part of arable land. On the basis of selected scenarios, the effect of land use changes on the runoff generation processes of an area and on the hydrograph is described. Land use changes are able to reduce the portion of quick runoff components, the water erosion and the discharge. The effect occurs especially in smaller catchments and with short heavy rains (events with a frequency of occurrence of 5–50 years). Depending on the present situation the changes have to include areas of more than 25% of the catchments area to cause a significant effect. It became apparent that nature conservation and flood prevention agree well in their requirements with the land use. A rich structured landscape proved to be extraordinarily positive for both, flood prevention and nature conservation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aarable soils 3aflood control 3ahydrograph 3aland use change 3alandscapes 3anatural resources conservation 3aresearch 3arisk 3arunoff 3asubwatersheds 3awater erosion1 aSeidler, C.1 aBianchin, S.1 aHeilmeier, H.1 aRichert, E.0 tSoil and Water Research.g, v. 3, no.

The crystal structure was identified by XRD as a single-phase perovskite structure with tetragonal symmetry. The valence of Mn ions, characterized by the synchrotron XAS technique, was seen to change from Mn⁴⁺ to Mn³⁺ during the formation of the crystal. The valence state of Mn strongly affected the crystal structure and ferroelectric properties of the ceramics. The ferroelectric parameters show the decrease of remnant polarization and the increase of the coercive field with increasing MnO₂ content. The results confirm the Mn³⁺ in KNNL perovskite lattices, leading to the formation of oxygen vacancies and hardening effects.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3aceramics 3acrystal structure 3aions 3amanganese 3amanganese dioxide 3aoxygen 3aphysics1 aKanchiang, K.1 aChandarak, S.1 aLaosiritaworn, Y.1 aRujirawat, S.1 aYimnirun, R.0 tCurrent applied physics.g2012 Mar., v. 12, no. 2 p.418-421dElsevier B.V.x1567-17397nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cap.2011.07.0403Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02779naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245013200166300001600298520148400314592002801798650002301826650002201849650001401871650002801885650001701913650002301930650002101953650001501974650001101989650001202000650002302012650001602035650002102051700001402072700001602086700001702102700001702119773009602136856008102232990002302313852000902336655001202345IND60093767920221121024238.0141104e201203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009376792DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cap.2011.07.0412doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBen Naceur, J.10aAnnealing effects on microstructural and optical properties of Nanostructured-TiO₂ thin films prepared by sol–gel technique  ap. 422-428.  aIn this paper we report on the effect of annealing on the microsctructural and optoelectronic properties of titanium dioxide (TiO₂) thin films prepared using sol–gel method onto silicon (Si) (100) and quartz substrates. The annealing temperatures range from 200 to 1000 °C. The Microstructural properties of annealed thin films were investigated by Thermal gravimetric analyses (TGA), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Raman Spectroscopy. The surface morphology of the film was examined using Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) method. The optical properties of TiO₂ thin films were characterized using UV–VIS and Spectroscopic ellipsometry. The results have shown that the TiO₂ thin films persist in the anatase phase even after annealing at 800 °C. The phase transformation from anatase to rutile occurred only when the films were annealed at 1000 °C. AFM studies revealed nanocrystalline structure where their shape and density depend strongly on the annealing temperatures. The elaborated nanostructured-TiO₂ thin films present a high transparency in the visible range. Spectroscopic ellipsometry (SE) study was used to determine the effect of annealing temperature on the thickness and on the optical constant of TiO₂ thin films. Spectroscopic ellipsometry and UV–VIS shows that the band gap of TiO₂ thin films was found to decrease when the annealing temperature increases. The Anatase phase was find to show higher photocatalytic activity than the rutile one.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRaman spectroscopy 3aX-ray diffraction 3aannealing 3aatomic force microscopy 3ananocrystals 3aoptical properties 3aphase transition 3aphotolysis 3aquartz 3asilicon 3asol-gel processing 3atemperature 3atitanium dioxide1 aGaidi, M.1 aBousbih, F.1 aMechiakh, R.1 aChtourou, R.0 tCurrent applied physics.g2012 Mar., v. 12, no. 2 p.422-428dElsevier B.V.x1567-17397nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cap.2011.07.0413Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02891naa a2200625 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004000111040001800151100002200169245015100191300001800342520100600360592002801366650002201394650002701416650001301443650001201456650001401468650001101482650002001493650000901513650001701522650002301539650001201562650001501574650001601589650001501605650001201620650002501632650001301657650004101670650000901711650003401720650002401754650002301778650002201801650002401823650001601847650003501863650003201898650001701930700002401947700001501971700002301986700001802009700001802027700001602045773009702061856008602158852000902244655001202253IND4447202320221119144040.0141110e201101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444720232DNAL7 a208260822pmid7 a10.1016/j.biortech.2010.08.0532doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVerheyen, Vincent10aCharacterization of organic particulates present in milk factory process waters used for reuse along with aerobically digested effluent wastewater  ap. 2118-2125.  aWastewater from a dairy processor is being reused and recycled both within the plant and for irrigation.

The aim of the present study was to evaluate the accuracy and reliability of two commercially available photometers, AccuCell™ and AccuRead™ pre-calibrated for boar semen in comparison to UltiMate™ boar version 12.3D, NucleoCounter SP100 and Thoma hemacytometer. For each type of instrument, concentration was measured on 34 boar semen samples in quadruplicate and agreement between measurements and instruments were evaluated. Accuracy for both photometers was illustrated by mean of percentage differences to the general mean. It was −0.6% and 0.5% for Accucell™ and Accuread™ respectively, no significant differences were found between instrument and mean of measurement among all equipment. Repeatability for both photometers was 1.8% and 3.2% for AccuCell™ and AccuRead™ respectively. Low differences were observed between instruments (confidence interval 3%) except when hemacytometer was used as a reference. Even though hemacytometer is considered worldwide as the gold standard, it is the more variable instrument (confidence interval 7.1%). The conclusion is that routine photometry measures of raw semen concentration are reliable, accurate and precise using AccuRead™ or AccuCell™. There are multiple steps in semen processing that can induce sperm loss and therefore increase differences between theoretical and real sperm numbers in doses. Potential biases that depend on the workflow but not on the initial photometric measure of semen concentration are discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aartificial insemination 3aboars 3aconfidence interval 3aphotometers 3asemen 3asperm concentration 3aspermatozoa 2aAnimals 2aCalibrationxstandards 2aMale 2aPhotometryxinstrumentationxveterinary. 2aReproducibility of Results 2aSemen Analysisxinstrumentationxmethodsxveterinary. 2aSperm Countxinstrumentationxmethodsxveterinary. 2aSwine1 aCamugli, S.1 aLévêque, C.,1 aSchmitt, E.1 aStaub, C.0 tTheriogenology.g2011 Feb., v. 75, no. 3 p.577-583dElsevier Inc.x0093-691X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.theriogenology.2010.09.0253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03311naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100006500150245009600215300001600311520163200327592002801959650001601987650001302003650001202016650001502028650001102043650002602054650001102080650001702091650001302108650001302121650001102134650002602145650003102171650001102202650001502213650001802228650001702246650001802263653003102281653001702312653001902329653001602348653002302364653001902387700004502406700003602451700002102487700002002508700002802528773009602556856008402652852000902736655001202745IND60603798320221122232813.0180716e201502  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060379832DNAL7 a10.1016/j.renene.2014.08.0662doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMata Sánchez, Jesús1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3716-235610aAssessment of near infrared spectroscopy for energetic characterization of olive byproducts  ap. 599-605.  aThe use of biofuels is a key factor in this transition away from fossil fuels. Today, biofuels are only a small share of world total energy supply. The characterization of biomass is a substantial improvement in the valorization of these resources, allowing a rational and controlled use of its energy potential. Therefore, a fast, reliable and cheap analytical technique is mandatory in order to increase the quality control of these products in the bioenergetic industry and enable comprehensive traceability of raw materials and processes in pursuit of a better use of resources. Near-Infrared (NIR) spectroscopy is eligible for the development of quality control systems of products and processes in accordance with the new demands taking into account their high response speed, low cost per sample, absence of sample preparation, versatility for the analysis of many different products and parameters. NIR spectroscopy prediction model for determination of quality parameters such us moisture, gross energetic value, ash content, volatile fraction content, and elemental composition (Carbon, Hydrogen, and Nitrogen) from ground and dried olive residues have been obtained. High accuracy in prediction for a test set has been achieved for all the parameters (R² > 0.7) except for Hydrogen content. As expected, Standard Error of Prediction (SEP) for ground samples is better than dried samples except for moisture content. This study illustrates the possibility of using the NIR technique in combination with multivariate data analysis to predict economically important properties of olive byproducts for energetic uses.  aPublisher supplied data 3aash content 3abiofuels 3abiomass 3abyproducts 3acarbon 3aelemental composition 3aenergy 3afossil fuels 3ahydrogen 3aindustry 3amodels 3amultivariate analysis 3anear-infrared spectroscopy 3aolives 3aprediction 3araw materials 3atraceability 3awater content 0aNear infrared spectroscopy 0aChemometrics 0aEnergetic uses 0aOlive stone 0aOlive tree pruning 0a“Orujillo”1 aPérez-Jiménez, J.

Abscisic acid (ABA) plays an important role in plant responses to abiotic stresses, such as drought and salinity. Upon screening T-DNA mutants of DWD genes for ABA responses we obtained several candidates that exhibited ABA-hypersensitivity, and one was named DWA3 (DWD hypersensitive to ABA 3). DWA3 interacted with DDB1, which has been proposed to be an adaptor protein of the CUL4 E3 ligase complex, in yeast two-hybrid assays. Also, association between DWA3 and the DDB1–CUL4 machinery was detected in vivo by co-immunoprecipitation assays, indicating that DWA3 may function as a substrate receptor for CRL4. ABA-inducible transcription factors (ABI5 and AtMYC2) and their downstream genes were hyper-induced by ABA in dwa3. Taken together, we suggest that DWA3 is a negative regulator of ABA responses and may be involved in protein degradation mediated by CRL4.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArabidopsis 3aabscisic acid 3adrought 3agenes 3aligases 3amutants 3aprotein degradation 3areceptors 3asalinity 3ascreening 3asignal transduction 3atranscription factors 3atransfer DNA 3aubiquitin 3ayeasts 2aAbscisic Acidxmetabolism 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aArabidopsisxenzymologyxgenetics. 2aArabidopsis Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aDNA, Bacterial 2aDNA-Binding Proteinsxmetabolism 2aGene Expression Regulation, Plant 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aMutagenesis, Insertional. 2aMutation 2aPlants, Genetically Modifiedxenzymologyxgenetics. 2aProtein Binding 2aSignal Transduction 2aTwo-Hybrid System Techniques 2aUbiquitin-Protein Ligasesxgeneticsxmetabolism.1 aTerzaghi, William1 aDeng, Xing Wang0 tPlant science.g2011 Feb., v. 180, no. 2 p.352-357dElsevier Ireland Ltdx0168-94527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.plantsci.2010.10.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02564naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245010400169300001800273520147000291592002801761650001301789650001201802650001101814650002101825650001701846650001401863700006101877700002301938700006501961773011902026856008402145852000902229655001202238IND60634933320190422000000.0190326e20190314xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063493332DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.macromol.8b027012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShahid, Taisir10aDiluting Entangled Polymers Affects Transient Hardening but Not Their Steady Elongational Viscosity  ap. 2521-2530.  aIt is now established that the huge qualitative difference in flow behavior between entangled polymer melts and solutions in nonlinear elongational flows cannot be explained in the framework of the “standard” tube model. Instead, the additional relaxation mechanism of alignment-induced friction reduction, acting primarily in melts, has shown its interesting potential to explain the experimental data. Here, we critically assess this mechanism by means of a systematic experimental investigation of the extensional response of long polystyrene chains diluted in short chain matrices of varying molar mass, varying the interaction between long chains and their molecular environment. We find that, surprisingly, all polystyrene blends exhibit different transient strain hardening properties but the same apparent steady-state elongational viscosity; i.e., the long chains reach the same final stretch state as long as the short chain exceeds a critical molar mass of about 4 kg/mol, well below the entanglement limit, and do not significantly contribute to the strain hardening. This observation contradicts, in part, the basic assumption according to which the elongation state of a chain depends on its molecular environment, and raises new fundamental questions, in particular on the relationship between transient strain hardening and the stretch state of the chains and its consequences on the nonuniversal behavior of melts and solutions in strong flows.  aPublisher supplied data 3afriction 3amelting 3amodels 3amolecular weight 3apolystyrenes 3aviscosity1 aClasen, Christian1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9253-90081 aOosterlinck, Filip1 avan Ruymbeke, Evelyne1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7633-01940 tMacromolecules.g2019 Mar. 14, v. 52, no. 6 p.2521-2530dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23616x1520-58357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.macromol.8b027013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01913naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001300152245005700165300001600222520065000238592002800888650002400916650001300940650001200953650001000965650001500975650001600990650002701006653002801033653001801061653001901079653002801098653002801126700001401154700001401168700001501182700001901197700001701216700001601233773013501249856008601384852000901470655001201479IND60095583320221119090449.0161021e20130905xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009558332DNAL7 a10.1016/j.colsurfa.2013.07.0352doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDu, Xing10aSynthesis and properties of multilayered films foams  ap. 599-603.  aThe unstable nature of liquid foams is hampering their use in all the applications.

There is a need for risk classification and examination for increasing the CSC effectiveness in the industry. These kinds of studies in developing countries like Bangladesh are few. To reach the goals of this study, for evaluating the risk factors obtained from a survey-design and feedback from experts, a fuzzy synthetic evaluation (FSE) approach-based model is developed. The findings revealed that “quality degradation of recycled products” and “CE framework risks” are the most critical risk factors and groups in CSC initiatives, respectively. The findings are essential because they enable experts to understand the urgency in managing risks associated with CSC concepts. Therefore, the findings can be used to help industrial managers, government policymakers, and other stakeholders across the CSC of interest to implement and maintain the CSCs given the acknowledged risks.  aPublisher supplied data 3acircular economy 3aindustry 3astakeholders 3asupply chain 3aBangladesh 0aCircular supply chain (CSC) 0aCircular economy practices (CEP) 0aCircular economy strategies (CES) 0aRisk assessment 0aFuzzy synthetic evaluation (FSE).1 aAli, Syed Mithun1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4302-59911 aGarshasbi, Maryam1 aKabir, Golam1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9591-06290 tJournal of cleaner production.g2021 Oct. 01, v. 317 p.128420-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2021.1284203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03162naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245012000165300001600285520177700301592002802078650001402106650001902120650000902139650001502148650002202163650002402185650002202209650003102231650000902262650003002271650002402301650001102325650001602336650001102352651001002363700001602373700001602389700001102405700002002416700001802436700001502454773013302469856008102602852000902683655001202692IND60597805220221122131835.0180627e201807  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059780522DNAL7 a10.1007/s00704-017-2206-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMeng, Fanchao14aThe effects of climate change on heating energy consumption of office buildings in different climate zones in China  ap. 521-530.  aClimate plays an important role in heating energy consumption owing to the direct relationship between space heating and changes in meteorological conditions. To quantify the impact, the Transient System Simulation Program software was used to simulate the heating loads of office buildings in Harbin, Tianjin, and Shanghai, representing three major climate zones (i.e., severe cold, cold, and hot summer and cold winter climate zones) in China during 1961–2010. Stepwise multiple linear regression was performed to determine the key climatic parameters influencing heating energy consumption. The results showed that dry bulb temperature (DBT) is the dominant climatic parameter affecting building heating loads in all three climate zones across China during the heating period at daily, monthly, and yearly scales (R ² ≥ 0.86). With the continuous warming climate in winter over the past 50 years, heating loads decreased by 14.2, 7.2, and 7.1 W/m² in Harbin, Tianjin, and Shanghai, respectively, indicating that the decreasing rate is more apparent in severe cold climate zone. When the DBT increases by 1 °C, the heating loads decrease by 253.1 W/m² in Harbin, 177.2 W/m² in Tianjin, and 126.4 W/m² in Shanghai. These results suggest that the heating energy consumption can be well predicted by the regression models at different temporal scales in different climate conditions owing to the high determination coefficients. In addition, a greater decrease in heating energy consumption in northern severe cold and cold climate zones may efficiently promote the energy saving in these areas with high energy consumption for heating. Particularly, the likely future increase in temperatures should be considered in improving building energy efficiency.  aPublisher supplied data 3abuildings 3aclimate change 3acold 3acold zones 3acomputer software 3aenergy conservation 3aenergy efficiency 3aenergy use and consumption 3aheat 3ameteorological parameters 3aregression analysis 3asummer 3atemperature 3awinter 3aChina1 aLi, Mingcai1 aCao, Jingfu1 aLi, Ji1 aXiong, Mingming1 aFeng, Xiaomei1 aRen, Guoyu0 tTheoretical and applied climatology.g2018 July, v. 133, no. 1-2 p.521-530dSpringer ViennawJournal:jnl3932171x0177-798X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00704-017-2206-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02033naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001600143245032500159300001800484520064000502592002801142650001501170650002101185650001801206650001601224650004401240650002301284650001301307653001101320653001101331653002301342653001801365653001701383700002001400773015301420856007701573852000901650655001201659IND60521573020221120100500.0160530e20140602xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052157302DNAL7 a10.1515/znb-1979-10202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFalk, Heinz10aBeiträge zur Chemie der Pyrrolpigmente, XXXIII [1] Darstellung, Struktur und Eigenschaften von isomeren N-Methyl-Bilatrienen-abc (N-Methyl-etiobiliverdine-IV-γ) / On the Chemistry of Pyrrole Pigments, XXXIII [1] Synthesis, Structure and Properties of Isomeric N-Methyl-bilatrienes-abc (N-Methyl-etiobiliverdines-IV-γ)  ap. 1448-1453.  aMethylation of etiobiliverdin-IV-γ yields a ring-A N-methylated product the structure of which was proven by comparison with the corresponding monolactimether and the ring-B methylated product which was synthesized on an independent route.

In order to further investigate the role of Se and selected trace elements in the occurrence of EC disease, 663 samples including 206 cultivated soils, 247 sediments, 45 loess deposits and 165 grain samples from 45 villages in the Golestan province of Iran were collected and analyzed. Villages in the study area were classified into 2 groups according to the EC incidence in the local population. The results of this study demonstrate that, contrary to the expected trend, total Se concentrations in soil, grain, sediment, and loess samples increase from the low to the high EC areas suggesting that Se deficiency does not play a major role in the etiology of EC. On the other hand, antimony (Sb), and strontium (Sr) content in soil, grain, loess, and sediment samples is much higher in the high esophageal cancer area, which may be a significant factor. Total zinc (Zn) concentrations in soil, grain, loess, and sediment samples decrease from the low to the high cancer areas. Therefore, Zn deficiency may be a significant factor in EC incidence rate in the Golestan province.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantimony 3adisease occurrence 3aesophageal neoplasms 3aetiology 3agrains 3aloess 3arisk 3aselenium 3asoil 3astrontium 3avillages 3azinc 2aEnvironmental Pollutantsxtoxicity 2aEsophageal Neoplasmsxchemically induced 2aHumans 2aMass Spectrometry 2aRisk Factors 2aSeleniumxtoxicity 2aTrace Elementsxtoxicity 3aIran 0aIranxepidemiology.1 aMoore, Farid1 aNajmeddin, Ali1 aRahmani, Farah0 tScience of the total environment.g2012 Sept. 1, v. 433 p.89-97dElsevier B.V.x0048-96977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2012.04.0333Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02822naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002600147245013300173300001800306500001900324520150700343592002801850650002301878650001501901650001501916650002201931650000901953650002501962650001501987650001402002650002402016650001302040650001102053650000702064650001402071650001302085650003302098650001202131650001902143700002202162773013502184856004802319852000902367655001202376IND50063429520221121130012.0130325e201303  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006342952DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-012-0981-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKumar, M.

A series of batch experiments were performed to find out the adsorption isotherms and kinetic behaviour of Cr⁶⁺ in the aqueous solution. The adsorption process was examined with three independent variables viz. NBP dosage, initial Cr⁶⁺ concentrations and pH. Seventeen batch experiments designed by Box–Behnken using response surface methodology were carried out, and the adsorption efficiency was modelled using polynomial equation as the function of the independent variables. Based on the uptake capacity and economic use of adsorbent, the independent variables were optimized by two procedures. The desirability of first and second optimization procedures were found to be 1.00 and 0.84, respectively, which shows that the estimated function may well represent the experimental model. The kinetic study indicated that the rate of adsorption confirms to the pseudo-second-order rate equation. Thermodynamics study indicated that the adsorption process was spontaneous and endothermic in nature. The surface texture changes in NBP were obtained from FT-IR analysis. The optimized result obtained from RAMP plots revealed that the NBP was supposed to be an effective and economically feasible adsorbent for the removal of Cr⁶⁺ from an aqueous system.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAzadirachta indica 3aadsorbents 3aadsorption 3aaqueous solutions 3abark 3aeconomic feasibility 3aendothermy 3aequations 3aexperimental design 3akinetics 3amodels 3apH 3apollution 3aresearch 3aresponse surface methodology 3atexture 3athermodynamics1 aPhanikumar, B.

Dual-band modes have two resonances in which the first one is fixed as a left-handed mode and the second one can be arranged as a left-handed or single-negative mode. We select the character of second resonance by the choice of substrate properties. The metamaterial features of the structure are analyzed using the scattering data and confirmed by applying Kramers–Kronig relations. The characteristic features are also verified by the current distribution at the inner metallic surfaces of the structure. The influence of substrate modifications is studied and the effect of this change on resonances is discussed. The design of a dual-band and polarization-independent sub-THz metamaterial presented here can serve as a model and guide to realize tunable fishnet metamaterials for other frequency regimes.  aPublisher supplied data 3ainfrared radiation 3amaterials 3ametals 3amicrowave radiation 3amodels 3asurfaces1 aRoskos, Hartmut G.0 tCurrent applied physics.g2012 Mar., v. 12, no. 2 p.443-450dElsevier B.V.x1567-17397nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cap.2011.07.0473Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02276naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100006200150245006400212300001800276520134300294592002801637650001501665650001301680650001501693700005701708700002101765773011901786856008401905852000901989655001201998IND60634933520221123025505.0190326e20190318xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063493352DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.macromol.9b000102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWengenmayr, Martin1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0627-712910aDendrimers in Solution of Linear Polymers: Crowding Effects  ap. 2616-2626.  aWe study dendrimers embedded in a solution of linear chains with various degrees of polymerization and concentrations. We distinguish the term “crowding”, addressing the impact of the polymer environment on the dendrimer, from the term “semidilute”, which refers to the state of the polymer environment only. Depending on the length of linear chains, two regimes are observed. Dendrimers in a solution of chains much shorter then their own size display good solvent characteristics at all concentrations. In a dense solution of long chains the dendrimer conformation statistics changes qualitatively. It displays Gaussian scaling with respect to the spacer length instead of the cube root behavior expected for a compact globule. We have found a very good description of the simulation data by using a geometrical ansatz where for crowding given by the matching of the characteristic length scales of the two subsystems; i.e., the ratio of the dendrimer size and the correlation length of the semidilute solution provides the relevant scaling variable. Our study reveals that dendrimer conformations in the strongly crowed state neither are in a compact globular state nor do they correspond to a mean-field θ-state. Instead, a novel scaling variable combining the properties of both species reflects the conformation statistics.  aPublisher supplied data 3adendrimers 3asolvents 3astatistics1 aDockhorn, Ron1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5268-54301 aSommer, Jens-Uwe0 tMacromolecules.g2019 Mar. 18, v. 52, no. 6 p.2616-2626dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23616x1520-58357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.macromol.9b000103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02963naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001900145245009000164300001800254500001500272520172100287592002802008650001802036650001002054650001302064650001302077650001102090650002202101650001502123650001402138650002602152650001202178650001302190650000902203650002202212650001702234650001302251650001502264651001102279653001602290700001802306700002102324773009102345856004802436852000902484655001202493IND4474860520221117175413.0120721e201208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447486052DNAL7 a10.1007/s11258-012-0094-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEvju, Marianne10aEffects of disturbance on plant regrowth along snow pack gradients in alpine habitats  ap. 1345-1355.  a2019-12-06  aHuman disturbance in alpine habitats is expected to increase, and improved knowledge of short-term recovery after disturbance events is necessary to interpret vegetation responses and formulate planning and mitigation efforts. The ability of a plant community to return to its original state after a disturbance (community resilience) depends on species composition and environmental conditions. The aim of this study is to analyze initial short-term effects of disturbance in alpine plant communities in contrasting climates (oceanic vs. continental; central Norway). We used a nested block-design to examine vegetative regrowth and seedling recruitment after experimental perturbation. Three plant community types along the snow pack gradient were exposed to (1) no disturbance, (2) clipping, and (3) clipping and uprooting. Slow vegetative regrowth and low seedling establishment rates were found in dry alpine ridges and late-melting oceanic snowbed communities. Leeside habitats with intermediate snow conditions were found more resilient. The difference was related to growth form and species diversity. Woody species, which dominated in ridges and oceanic snowbeds, showed the most negative response to disturbance. Species-rich plant communities dominated by graminoids and herbs showed higher rates of regrowth. Species richness seems to cause resilience to the plant communities through higher response diversity. Plant communities at the extreme ends of abiotic gradients, ridges and late-melting snowbeds, will be most sensitive to both disturbance and environmental change. In an up-scaled human-used landscape disturbance effects will be amplified and further limit recovery to a pre-disturbance state.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalpine plants 3aherbs 3aplanning 3asnowpack 3ahumans 3aplant communities 3alandscapes 3aseedlings 3aenvironmental factors 3aPoaceae 3aregrowth 3asnow 3aspecies diversity 3awoody plants 3ahabitats 3avegetation 3aNorway 0arecruitment1 aHagen, Dagmar1 aHofgaard, Annika0 tPlant ecology.g2012 Aug., v. 213, no. 8 p.1345-1355dSpringer-Verlagx1385-02377nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11258-012-0094-5  aDNAL 7aarticle01159naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002500143245012400168300001800292520015500310592002800465650002300493650002300516650002600539650002200565650000800587653003500595773015300630856007700783852000900860655001200869IND60521573220221120084424.0160530e20140602xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052157322DNAL7 a10.1515/znb-1979-10222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchwarzhans, Karl E.10aDarstellung eines Zinnhomologen der "Methylidyn-Cluster" / Preparation of a Tin Homologue of the "Methylidyne Clusters"  ap. 1456-1458.  aA new tin-cobaltcarbonyl-cluster, a homo-logue of the methylidyne clusters, has been prepared and identified by IR and masspectro-metric measurements.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemical reactions 3achemical structure 3ainfrared spectroscopy 3amass spectrometry 3atin 0aTin - Cobaltcarbonyl - Cluster0 tZeitschrift für Naturforschung.g2014 June 2, v. 34, no. 10 p.1456-1458dVerlag der Zeitschrift für NaturforschungwJournal:23182x0932-07767nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1515/znb-1979-10223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02915naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100003200139245011400171300001800285500002000303520151300323592002801836650002601864650001501890650001801905650001101923650001001934650001701944650001901961650002601980650003102006650004302037650001602080650000902096650001002105650002502115650001902140700006602159700002402225773014902249856007402398852000902472655001202481IND60595914220221122010420.0180619e201807  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059591422DNAL7 a10.1002/jsfa.88652doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGhanei Ghooshkhaneh, Narges10aDetection and classification of citrus green mold caused by Penicillium digitatum using multispectral imaging  ap. 3542-3550.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aBACKGROUND: Fungal decay is a prevalent condition that mainly occurs during transportation of products to consumers (from harvest to consumption) and adversely affects postharvest operations and sales of citrus fruit. There are a variety of methods to control pathogenic fungi, including UV‐assisted removal of fruit with suspected infection before storage, which is a time‐consuming task and associated with human health risks. Therefore it is essential to adopt efficient and dependable alternatives for early decay detection. In this study, detection of orange decay caused by Penicillium genus fungi was examined using spectral imaging, a novel automated inspection technique for agricultural products. RESULTS: The reflectance parameter (including mean reflectance) and reflectance distribution parameters (including standard deviation and skewness) of surfaces were extracted from decayed and rotten regions of infected samples and healthy regions of non‐infected samples. The classification accuracy of rotten, decayed and healthy regions at 4 and 5 days after fungal inoculation was 98.6 and 100% respectively using the mean and skewness of 500 nm, 800 nm, 900 nm and modified normalized difference vegetation index (MNDVI) spectra. CONCLUSION: Comparison of results between healthy and infected samples showed that early real‐time detection of Penicillium digitatum using multispectral imaging was possible within the near‐infrared (NIR) range. © 2018 Society of Chemical Industry  aPublisher supplied data 3aPenicillium digitatum 3aautomation 3acitrus fruits 3afruits 3afungi 3ahuman health 3aimage analysis 3amultispectral imagery 3anear-infrared spectroscopy 3anormalized difference vegetation index 3areflectance 3arisk 3asales 3astatistical analysis 3atransportation1 aGolzarian, Mahmood Reza1http://orcid.org/0000-0002-8370-19661 aMamarabadi, Mojtaba0 tJournal of the science of food and agriculture.g2018 July, v. 98, no. 9 p.3542-3550dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.wJournal:jnl48536x0022-51427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jsfa.88653Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03266naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245012900168300001600297520171600313592002802029650001102057650002902068650001702097650001702114650001902131650002202150650001802172650000902190650002402199650002602223650001302249650001502262651001102277651002902288653000802317653000802325653001502333653001802348653002902366653002002395653002202415653000902437700001802446700001702464700002302481700002202504773011602526856008502642852000902727655001202736IND50063387620221119170252.0190403e20130401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006338762DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foreco.2012.12.0382doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNapal, María10aPast deforestation of Mediterranean Europe explains the present distribution of the strict forest dweller Myotis bechsteinii  ap. 161-170.  aHabitat loss and degradation are perceived as main factors threatening biodiversity. Historical rather than contemporary processes are often responsible for present patterns of species’ distribution, but their respective contributions are not always easy to disentangle. The strict forest specialist, sedentary, highly phylopatric Bechstein’s bat (Myotis bechsteinii) is an ideal model species to assess the effect of historical landscape transformations in the current distribution patterns of forest species. Although to date the species has been considered almost absent from the Mediterranean range (Southern Europe), recently it has been shown to be common in certain spots there. We test whether the present distribution and ecological preferences of the species in this area are related to biogeographical constraints or to clearance of forests from preferred areas. We assessed roost selection, spatial ecology, foraging habitat selection, and prey selection in Atlantic and Mediterranean domains of the Iberian Peninsula. Ecological requirements appeared conserved throughout, but roost selection appeared less constrained in the Mediterranean localities. Hunting occurred preferentially inside closed deciduous oak forest in both regions, but commuting distances and foraging areas were larger in the Atlantic, together with higher habitat fragmentation and lower prey availability. The same prey taxa were eaten in both regions, although their frequency in the diet varied, matching differences in availability. Consequently, scarcity of these bats in Mediterranean Iberia seems to be better explained by the retreat or loss of deciduous forests due to human impacts, coupled with climate change.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMyotis 3aanthropogenic activities 3abiodiversity 3abiogeography 3aclimate change 3adeciduous forests 3adeforestation 3adiet 3ahabitat destruction 3ahabitat fragmentation 3ahabitats 3alandscapes 3aEurope 3aSouthern European region 0aMCP 0ak95 0aForest bat 0aDeforestation 0aLandscape transformation 0aRoost selection 0aHabitat selection 0aDiet1 aGarin, Inazio1 aGoiti, Urtzi1 aSalsamendi, Egoitz1 aAihartza, Joxerra0 tForest ecology and management.g2013 Apr. 01, v. 293 p.161-170dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl9013x0378-11277nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foreco.2012.12.0383Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03288naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002300152245005800175300001400233520193900247592002802186650001502214650001502229650002402244650002202268650001202290650001102302650002502313650001302338650001502351650001202366650001502378650001302393650003702406650001502443653001602458653001502474653002102489653001402510653002202524700002602546700001802572773013302590856008602723852000902809655001202818IND60095583620221119090356.0161021e20130905xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009558362DNAL7 a10.1016/j.colsurfa.2013.05.0632doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKrivova, Maryna G.10aAdsorption of CnTABr surfactants on activated carbons  ap. 62-70.  aCationic surfactants of the quaternary ammonium bromide type C16TABr, C14TABr, C12TABr, and C10TABr were adsorbed from aqueous solutions onto three different types of activated carbons and compared with the adsorption of the anionic surfactant sodium dodecyl benzene sulfonate. The concentrations of both cationic and anionic surfactants in aqueous solutions were determined by UV spectroscopy. In the case of anionic surfactants, a linear dependence of UV absorbance on the surfactant concentration at 200nm can be related to the benzene fragment of the molecule. The UV sensitivity of CnTABr solutions is controlled by the hydration of bromide counterions, the electron dense nature of bromine, and a charge-transfer-to-solvent phenomenon. Changes in the textural properties of the activated carbons after adsorption of surfactants were studied by N2 adsorption and mercury intrusion porosimetry, and could be correlated to surface characteristics and adsorptive capacity. The mechanism of adsorption was found to be complex, but the porous structure of the carbon exerted a critical role and the cationic surfactants were adsorbed step-by-step. At low surfactant concentrations, adsorption occurred in micropores. We conclude that surfactants are adsorbed as individual molecules. Adsorption from more concentrated solutions occurs in meso- and macropores, and resembles surfactant adsorption on flat carbon surfaces. The carbons display somewhat different tendencies to adsorb CnTABr. Activated carbons with small pores of 0.56-0.77nm appear to be most effective for surfactant removal. A negative electrostatic potential on the interface of the carbons appears to enhance the adsorption of cationic surfactants, as would be expected. Controlling the electrostatic potential and pore size distribution of the activated carbons would be beneficial in the application of activated carbons for removal of surfactants from wastewater.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorbance 3aadsorption 3aanionic surfactants 3aaqueous solutions 3abromine 3acarbon 3acationic surfactants 3acolloids 3amacropores 3amercury 3amicropores 3anitrogen 3aultraviolet-visible spectroscopy 3awastewater 0aSurfactants 0aAdsorption 0aActivated carbon 0aMechanism 0aTextural analysis1 aGrinshpan, Dmitrij D.1 aHedin, Niklas0 tColloids and Surfaces A: Physicochemical and Engineering Aspects.g2013 Sept. 05, v. 436 p.62-70dElsevier B.V.x0927-77577nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfa.2013.05.0633Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01134naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001900143245006500162300001800227520012500245592002800370650001400398650001200412650002400424650001400448650001400462650001200476653001800488653001400506653001200520653001400532653001200546773014000558856007700698852000900775655001200784IND60521573320221120084508.0160530e20140602xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052157332DNAL7 a10.1515/znb-1979-10232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPeringer, Paul10aN-Organoquecksilber-Nucleoside / N-Organomercury Nucleosides  ap. 1459-1460.  aThe synthesis of the N-organomercury nucleosides C₆H₅HgL (LH = guanosine, inosine, thymidine, uridine) is described.  aPublisher supplied data 3aguanosine 3ainosine 3aluteinizing hormone 3asynthesis 3athymidine 3auridine 0aOrganomercury 0aGuanosine 0aInosine 0aThymidine 0aUridine0 tZeitschrift für Naturforschung B.g2014 June 2, v. 34, no. 10 p.1459-1460dVerlag der Zeitschrift für Naturforschungx1865-71177nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1515/znb-1979-10233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01476naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002600139245008300165300001800248520045300266592002800719650002300747650001800770650002200788650002000810700002900830700001900859700002600878700003100904700002500935773010600960856007501066852000901141655001201150IND60578550220180213000000.0170813e20130621xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057855022DNAL7 a10.1021/ol40120532doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 avan Rijssel, Erwin R.10aChiral Pyrroline-Based Ugi-Three-Component Reactions Are under Kinetic Control  ap. 3026-3029.  aAlthough it is often assumed that the stereochemistry in Ugi multicomponent reactions is determined in the final Mumm rearrangement step, experimental and computational evidence that Ugi reactions on hydroxylated pyrrolines proceed under kinetic control is reported.

(Bohemian Forest) during the vegetative seasons of 1983–2000. The heat balance, potential and actual transpiration, entropy production and gross primary productivity were evaluated. It was found that the global radiation, precipitation amount, and soil water retention are the crucial factors determining the hydrologic pattern and gross primary productivity. Insufficient soil water retention leads to low entropy production by evaporation and low gross primary productivity, which results in the extremalisation of the hydrologic cycle. On the other hand, in the case of sufficient soil water retention, high entropy production by transpiration and high gross primary productivity lead to the stability of the hydrologic cycle.  aPublisher supplied data 3aentropy 3aevaporation 3aforests 3agross primary productivity 3aheat 3ahydrologic cycle 3ameadows 3aresearch 3asoil water retention 3atranspiration1 aLichner, Ľ.1 aTesař, M.1 aKrejča, M.1 aVáchal, J.0 tSoil and Water Research.g, v. 3, no.

In this paper we studied large-scale (synoptic) weather patterns and the corresponding occurrence of forest fires in this complex topography. The database for our analysis comprised three main parts: a daily classification of weather types in the period 1951–2010, daily calculated forest fire danger indices at five selected stations in the Alps (1951–2010) and ten years of observed forest fires (2001–2010). Firstly we analyzed the frequency of the 11 different weather types and show that the Alps are a region where cyclonic flows in general, and westerly cyclonic in particular, are the dominating large-scale weather pattern due to their location in the westerlies of the global circulation system. Comparing the weather types with three calculated sub-indices of the Canadian Forest Fire Danger Rating System (FFMC, DC, DMC) at five selected sites (representative of the different climate regions in the Alps) revealed a strong dependence of meteorological forest fire danger on flow direction and cyclonality. Cyclonic weather types were characterized by a high relative humidity and in consequence a low fire danger, while the calculated fire danger in anticyclonic weather situations was significantly higher. Furthermore, strong regional differences occurred in dependence on the flow direction. Northerly winds resulted in low fire danger north of the Alps, due to orographic enhanced precipitation, and high forest fire danger south of the Alps, because of dry katabatic foehn winds. In general, the stations in the Northern Alps showed significantly lower fire index values than the stations in the south and additionally a stronger seasonal variation with considerably higher index values in summer. Regional differences were highest for the FFMC, followed by the DMC and the DC, and could be attributed to the time lag of different forest soil layers. DMC and DC relate to a rather thick soil layer which reacts very slowly and since weather types in the Alps usually change every 7th day, drying of this deep layer is too slow to reveal significant differences between the regions. The Alpine forest fire database was analyzed on a national basis to identify correlations between observed fires and large-scale weather types. 95% of the observed fires in the EU-defined Alpine Space in the past decade occurred in the two southern countries Italy and France. This was likely due to both favorable climatic conditions and better database quality in these two countries. Unfortunately, the datasets of some regions north of the Alps (e.g. in Switzerland, Germany, Austria) were very patchy. A strong human influence on the Alpine fire regime resulted in a generally low correlation between weather types and observed forest fires. Surprisingly, many forest fires occurred in conjunction with cyclonic weather types. This could be explained by the start date of the fire which was mostly at the end of a drought period when the large-scale synoptical conditions had already turned to cyclonic. Nevertheless, most and biggest fires occurred during high pressure systems and other anticyclonic situations when the fuels were completely dry.  aPublisher supplied data 3aburning 3aclimate 3adatabases 3adrought 3afire hazard 3afire regime 3afire weather 3aforest fires 3aforest soils 3aforest types 3afuels 3ahumans 3amontane forests 3arelative humidity 3aseasonal variation 3asummer 3atopography 3awind 3aAlps region 3aAustria 3aFrance 3aGermany 3aItaly 3aSwitzerland 0aAlps 0aSynoptic weather types 0aForest fire danger 0aFire occurrence 0aCanadian Forest Fire Danger Rating System 0aFoehn1 aSchunk, Christian1 aLüpke, Marvin1 aCocca, Giampaolo1 aConedera, Marco1 aValese, Eva1 aMenzel, Annette0 tAgricultural and forest meteorology.g2013 Jan. 15, v. 168 p.15-25dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl43250x0168-19237nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agrformet.2012.08.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02940naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245007200163300001600235520171700251592002801968650000801996650002002004650001102024650001602035650001202051650001902063650001902082650001102101650001102112650001102123651001802134651001002152651001202162700001502174700001402189700001502203700001602218700001802234700001902252773013302271856008102404852000902485655001202494IND60597805620221122131834.0180627e201807  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059780562DNAL7 a10.1007/s00704-017-2205-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSun, Xiubao12aA remarkable climate warming hiatus over Northeast China since 1998  ap. 579-594.  aCharacteristics and causes of global warming hiatus (GWH) phenomenon have received much attention in recent years.

The results show that (1) from 1951 to 2014, the warming trends of Tmax, Tmin, and Tmean are 0.20, 0.42, and 0.34 °C/decade respectively for the whole area, with the warming rate of Tmin about two times of Tmax, and the upward trend of Tmean obviously higher than mainland China and global averages; (2) in the period 1998–2014, the annual mean temperature consistently exhibits a cooling phenomenon in Northeast China, and the trends of Tmax, Tmin, and Tmean are −0.36, −0.14, and −0.28 °C/decade respectively; (3) in the GWH period, seasonal mean cooling mainly occurs in northern winter (DJF) and spring (MAM), but northern summer (JJA) and autumn (SON) still experience a warming, implying that the annual mean temperature decrease is controlled by the remarkable cooling of winter and spring; (4) compared to the global and mainland China averages, the hiatus phenomenon is more evident in Northeast China, and the cooling trends are more obvious in the cold season; (5) the Northeast China cooling trend occurs under the circulation background of the negative phase Arctic Oscillation (AO), and it is also closely related to strengthening of the Siberia High (SH) and the East Asian Trough (EAT), and the stronger East Asian winter monsoon (EAWM) over the GWH period.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3aair temperature 3aautumn 3acold season 3acooling 3aglobal warming 3amonsoon season 3aspring 3asummer 3awinter 3aArctic region 3aChina 3aSiberia1 aRen, Guoyu1 aRen, Yuyu1 aFang, Yihe1 aLiu, Yulian1 aXue, Xiaoying1 aZhang, Panfeng0 tTheoretical and applied climatology.g2018 July, v. 133, no. 1-2 p.579-594dSpringer ViennawJournal:jnl3932171x0177-798X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00704-017-2205-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02622naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100006100150245013000211300001800341520118500359592002801544650001401572650002301586650001501609650003301624650001801657650001601675650001501691650002601706650001801732650002101750650001501771650001901786650001301805650002401818700006001842700002501902700006101927773011901988856008402107852000902191655001202200IND60634933720221123025435.0190326e20190312xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063493372DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.macromol.9b000652doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAmador, Adrian G.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3837-883710aEntropically Driven Macrolide Polymerizations for the Synthesis of Aliphatic Polyester Copolymers Using Titanium Isopropoxide  ap. 2371-2383.  aThermal and mechanical properties of sustainable aliphatic polyesters can be tuned through the synthesis of copolymers.

Inexpensive and nontoxic titanium isopropoxide Ti(Oi-Pr)₄ functions as an active catalyst for these entropically driven ROTEPs, achieving high conversions (>90%) in under 1 h. The polymerizations exhibit control over molar mass with dispersity values <1.7. poly(GA-alt-2MD) is an amorphous polymer with a low glass transition temperature near −30 °C. poly(LA-co-3HP) exhibits a glass transition temperature up to 13 °C and, depending on the regioregularity, exhibits a melting temperature up to 96 °C.  aPublisher supplied data 3acatalysts 3acomposite polymers 3aendothermy 3aglass transition temperature 3aglycolic acid 3alactic acid 3amacrolides 3amechanical properties 3amelting point 3amolecular weight 3apolyesters 3apolymerization 3atitanium 3atransesterification1 aWatts, Annabelle1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2310-39611 aNeitzel, Angelika E.1 aHillmyer, Marc A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8255-38530 tMacromolecules.g2019 Mar. 12, v. 52, no. 6 p.2371-2383dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23616x1520-58357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.macromol.9b000653Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03164naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001500151245019100166300001400357520161100371592002801982650002802010650001602038650002202054650002302076650001502099650001102114650000902125650001502134650001802149650001402167650003102181650001102212650001902223650001402242650001302256653001402269653001102283653002802294653001802322653001902340653001902359700001902378700001902397700001702416700001702433773010102450856008602551852000902637655001202646IND60535904020221121231342.0190318e201506  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053590402DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aquatox.2015.03.0162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWu, Sumei,10aAnalyzing the effectiveness of using branchial NKA activity as a biomarker for assessing waterborne copper toxicity in tilapia (Oreochromis mossambicus): A damage-based modeling approach  ap. 51-59.  aBranchial Na＋-K＋-ATPase (NKA) activity has been suggested as a promising biomarker for assessing metal stress in aquatic organisms. However, studies that systematically show the effectiveness of using NKA activity to detect metal exposure and toxicity at the individual level are limited. In this study, we aimed to determine whether branchial NKA activity mechanistically responds to the accumulation of waterborne copper (Cu) and accounts for observed toxicity over time under environmentally-relevant and aquafarming Cu exposure levels (0.2, 1 and 2mgL−1). Temporal trends in Cu accumulation and the corresponding responses of branchial NKA activity resulting from Cu exposure were investigated in laboratory experiments conducted on juvenile tilapia (Oreochromis mossambicus), a freshwater teleost that shows potential as a bioindicator of real-time and historical metal pollution. We used the process-based damage assessment model (DAM) to inspect the time course of Cu toxicity by integrating the compensation process between Cu-induced inhibition and repair of branchial NKA activity. NKA activity acted as a sensitive biomarker for Cu exposure and accumulation in tilapia, which showed induced impairment of osmoregulation and lethality when they were exposed to environmentally relevant levels (0.2mgL−1), but not to higher exposure levels (1 and 2mgL−1) in aquaculture farms or contaminated aquatic ecosystems. This study highlights the benefits and limitations of using branchial NKA activity as a sensitive biomarker to assess the health status of a fish population and its ecosystem.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOreochromis mossambicus 3aaquaculture 3aaquaculture farms 3aaquatic ecosystems 3abiomarkers 3acopper 3afish 3afreshwater 3ahealth status 3ajuveniles 3alaboratory experimentation 3amodels 3aosmoregulation 3apollution 3atoxicity 0aBiomarker 0aCopper 0aDamage assessment model 0aNa+/K+-ATPase 0aToxicokinetics 0aToxicodynamics1 aTsai, Jeng-Wei1 aTzeng, Wen-Nan1 aChen, Wei-Yu1 aShih, Wan-Yu0 tAquatic toxicology.g2015 June, v. 163 p.51-59dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl33163x0166-445X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquatox.2015.03.0163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01792naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002500145245010300170300001600273500001500289520071200304592002801016650001601044650001801060650001101078650001301089650001901102650001201121650002001133650002001153650002201173650001701195653001501212700002201227773011201249856004801361852000901409655001201418IND4482955520221122104422.0121003e201107  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND448295552DNAL7 a10.1134/S00036838110400892doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLadyzhenskaya, E.

The compound has a caramel-like aroma and several important physiological activities, such as strong antioxidant activity. Here, we report the identification and characterization of an enzyme involved in the biosynthesis of HEMF in yeast. We fractionated yeast cell-free extract from Saccharomyces cerevisiae using column chromatography and partially purified a fraction with HEMF-forming activity. Peptide mass fingerprinting analysis showed that the partially purified fraction contains aldehyde reductase encoded by YNL134C. This reductase shares low sequence identity with enone oxidoreductase, which is responsible for the formation of 4-hydroxy-2,5-dimethyl-3(2H)-furanone (HDMF) and HEMF in plants. YNL134C was expressed heterologously in Escherichia coli, and the purified protein catalyzed the formation of HEMF from the mixture of Maillard reaction products, acetaldehydes, and NADPH. Multicopy expression in S. cerevisiae resulted in increased HEMF productivity, and gene knockout of YNL134C in S. cerevisiae resulted in decreased HEMF productivity. These data suggest that the translation product of YNL134C is the HEMF-producing enzyme in yeast. Detailed analyses of an intermediate in the enzymatic reaction mixture revealed that HEMF is synthesized from (2E)-2-ethylidene-4-hydroxy-5-methyl-3(2H)-furanone, which formed via Knoevenagel condensation between the acetaldehyde and 4-hydroxy-5-methyl-3(2H)-furanone derived from the Maillard reaction based on ribose and glycine, by YNL134Cp in an NADPH dependent manner. Overall, this study shed light on the molecular basis for the improvement of soy sauce flavor and the biotechnological production of HEMF.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3aMaillard reaction products 3aNADP (coenzyme) 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3aacetaldehyde 3aaldehyde reductase 3aantioxidant activity 3abiosynthesis 3achromatography 3acondensation reactions 3aenzymatic reactions 3aflavor 3agene targeting 3aodors 3aribose 3asequence analysis 3asoy sauce 3ayeasts 0aSoy sauce 0a4-Hydroxy-2(or 5)-ethyl-5(or 2)-methyl-3(2H)-furanone 0aYeast 0aYNL134C 0aFuranone 0aHomofuraneol 0aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 0aZygosaccharomyces rouxii1 aWatanabe, Jun1 aMogi, Yoshinobu1 aTsukioka, Yuichiro0 tJournal of bioscience and bioengineering.g2017 Mar., v. 123, no. 3 p.333-341dElsevier B.V.aThe Society for Biotechnology, JapanwJournal:jnl3929975x1389-17237nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jbiosc.2016.10.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03887naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100003300148245018600181300001800367520191700385592002802302596007502330596007502405596007502480650002202555650001202577650001602589650001302605650002002618650002202638650001302660650001402673650001402687650001902701650001602720650001802736650003202754700001702786700002602803700003902829700003002868700002702898700004902925700003802974700002703012700003403039700006803073773012403141856008303265852000903348655001203357IND60782386520221123001650.0220822e202206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078238652DNAL7 a10.1007/s11033-022-07327-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBonifácio, Lillian Gonzalez10aTNFα rs1799964 TT genotype may be a susceptibility factor for vertical transmission of Toxoplasma gondii and clinical signs in newborns from pregnant women with acute toxoplasmosis  ap. 4759-4768.  aBACKGROUND: One of the main impacts of Toxoplasma gondii infection occurs during pregnancy and is related to the vertical transmission of the parasite (congenital toxoplasmosis), which can cause severe clinical outcomes and fetal death. During acute infection, in order to control the rapid replication of tachyzoites, different host immune response genes are activated, and these include cytokine-encoding genes. Considering that polymorphisms in cytokine genes may increase susceptibility to vertical transmission of T. gondii by determining the immune status of the pregnant woman, this study evaluated the influence of polymorphisms of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα) rs1799964 (− 1031) and interleukin 1 beta (IL1β) rs16944 (− 511) genes on gestational toxoplasmosis and on the vertical transmission of the parasite and verified the allele and genotype frequency of these polymorphisms in pregnant patients whose respective newborn did or did not present clinical abnormalities suggestive of congenital toxoplasmosis. METHODS AND RESULTS: A total of 204 pregnant patients with (n = 114) or without (n = 90) infection by T. gondii were enrolled. No associations were found involving the polymorphisms rs1799964 (− 1031) of the TNFα gene and rs16944 (− 511) of the IL1β gene with the increased chance of T. gondii infection during pregnancy. However, it was observed that the maternal TT genotype referring to the polymorphism of the TNFα gene seems to influence the vertical transmission of the parasite (P = 0.01; χ² = 6.05) and the presence of clinical manifestation in newborns from pregnancies with acute toxoplasmosis (P = 0.007; χ² = 9.68). CONCLUSION: The TNFα rs1799964 TT genotype may act as a susceptibility factor for the vertical transmission of parasite and for the presence of clinical signs in newborns from pregnant women with acute toxoplasmosis.  aPublisher supplied data  a2015/20350-1cFundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado de São Paulo  a2018/04709-8cFundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado de São Paulo  a2019/08385-5cFundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado de São Paulo 3aToxoplasma gondii 3aalleles 3afetal death 3agenotype 3aimmune response 3amolecular biology 3aneonates 3aparasites 3apregnancy 3apregnant women 3atachyzoites 3atoxoplasmosis 3atumor necrosis factor-alpha1 aMelo, Mirele1 aAyo, Christiane Maria1 aAssoni, Letícia Carolina Paraboli1 aOlímpio, Larissa Martins1 aNogueira, Mariana Reis1 aSpegiorin, Lígia Cosentino Junqueira Franco1 aBarbosa, Deusenia Machado Ulisses1 ade Mattos, Luiz Carlos1 aPereira-Chioccola, Vera Lucia1 aBrandão, Cinara Cássia1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4836-31130 tMolecular biology reports.g2022 June, v. 49, no. 6 p.4759-4768dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl5510x0301-48517nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11033-022-07327-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02530naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001600151245009100167500001900258520114500277592002801422650001501450650001201465650001201477650002501489650000901514650001401523650001401537650000901551650002101560650001001581653003401591653000701625653002801632653002601660653001401686700005701700700001701757700001701774700001501791700005801806773011301864856008601977852000902063655001202072IND60722793520221119083446.0210226e20210505xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072279352DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhazmat.2020.1250222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGong, Huabo10aMechanism of cadmium removal from soil by silicate composite biochar and its recycling  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aBiochar added to the soil is generally difficult to separate.

(2) After three times of SBC and MSBC remediation, total Cd in soil decreased by 29.33% and 31.82% respectively, and available Cd decreased by 60.82% and 62.74% respectively. (3) After three cycles, the recovery rates of SBC and MSBC both exceeded 94.88%, and the highest adsorption regeneration rates of SBC and MSBC reached 83.09% and 92.06%, respectively.

In this technique, a small amount (a few microliters) of organic solvent is transferred to the bottom of a conical bottom test tube and a few mL of aqueous solution is moved through the organic solvent at relatively slow flow rate. The aqueous solution transforms into fine droplets while passing through the organic solvent. After extraction, the enriched analyte in the extraction solvent is determined by GC–FID. The type of extraction solvent, its volume, needle diameter, and aqueous sample flow rate were investigated. The enrichment factor was 221–269 under optimum conditions and the recovery was 89–102%. The linear ranges and limits of detection for BTEXs were 2–500 and 1.4–3.1µgL⁻¹, respectively. The relative standard deviations for 10µgL⁻¹ of BTEXs in water were 1.8–6.2% (n=5). The advantages of CSDF-ME are its low cost, relatively short sample preparation time, low solvent consumption, high recovery, and high enrichment factor.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaqueous solutions 3abenzene 3adetection limit 3adroplets 3agas chromatography 3aionization 3amicroextraction 3asolvents 3astatistical analysis 3atoluene 3axylene 0aContinuous sample drop flow-based microextraction 0aBTEXs 0aWater sample 0aGas chromatography flame ionization detector1 aKhayatian, Gholamreza1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5685-058X1 aMilani-Hosseini, Mohammad-Reza0 tTalanta.g2014 Nov. 01, v. 129 p.309-314dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11742x0039-91407nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.talanta.2014.05.0583Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02955naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002300151245013500174300001600309500001900325520135300344592002801697650001901725650001901744650001301763650002601776650001201802650000901814650001001823650001201833650000901845650001701854650001501871653001101886653001601897653001101913653000901924700001901933700002801952700002901980700002902009700002002038700003202058700002002090700002802110700002202138700003202160773013902192856008502331852000902416655001202425IND60705332420221121132007.0200803e20200802xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070533242DNAL7 a10.1080/03601234.2020.17821152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSalbego, Joseânia10aToxicological response of silver catfish (Rhamdia quelen) after acute exposure to a commercial insecticide containing thiamethoxam  ap. 749-755.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThis study assessed the hematological, enzymatic and osmoregulatory responses of silver catfish (Rhamdia quelen) exposed to sublethal concentrations (1.125 and 3.750 µg/L) of a commercial thiamethoxam-containing insecticide used on rice crops. Groups of 6 fish per tank (in triplicate, n = 3, total 54 fish) were exposed for up to 96 h to different concentrations of the compound. After this period, fish were placed in clean water for 48 h. Two fish from each tank (6 per treatment) that had been exposed to the insecticide for 24 h were anesthetized with eugenol and blood was collected to evaluate hematological and biochemical parameters. Blood, liver and muscle were collected for determination of metabolic parameters, plasma cortisol, Cl⁻, Na⁺ and K⁺ levels and H⁺-ATPase and Na⁺/K⁺-ATPase activity in the gill. H⁺-ATPase activity was higher in fish exposed to 1.125 µg/L insecticide at 24 h compared to control (0.0 µg/L). Differences in cortisol levels were evidenced throughout the experimental period. These results indicated that exposure to the insecticide changed the hematological, biochemical and metabolic profile of the animals, suggesting concern about environmental safety. Therefore, we discourage the use of this pesticide in areas that come into contact with water bodies inhabited by fish.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRhamdia quelen 3aacute exposure 3acortisol 3aenvironmental science 3aeugenol 3afish 3aliver 3amuscles 3arice 3athiamethoxam 3atoxicology 0aATPase 0ablood cells 0aplasma 0aions1 aSeben, Débora1 aSippert, Leticia Raquel1 aGressler, Luciane Tourem1 aArruda da Cunha, Jessyka1 aZanella, Renato1 ade Almeida Vaucher, Rodrigo1 aMarchesan, Enio1 aBaldisserotto, Bernardo1 aLoro, Vania Lucia1 aGolombieski, Jaqueline Ineu0 tJournal of environmental science and health.g2020 Aug. 2, v. 55, no. 8 p.749-755dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl11541x1532-41097nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/03601234.2020.17821153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02359naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245008800169300001600257520112200273592002801395650001501423650002801438650001701466650002001483650001701503650001401520650002001534650001901554650002101573650001101594650000901605650001801614650002001632650001901652700001901671700001501690700001901705700001501724773009601739856008101835852000901916655001201925IND60080288520221116172638.0140728e201407  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008028852DNAL7 a10.1134/S10642293140700842doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKurochkina, G.

The basic concept behind this design is to transform asphalt layers into a piezoelectric energy harvester to collect dissipated vehicle kinetic energy in a large-scale system. This EHPS design consists of two conductive asphalt layers and one piezoelectric material layer. To verify the feasibility of the design, this ongoing study theoretically analyzed the EHPS via a three-degree-of-freedom electromechanical model and practically tested a prototype in the laboratory. Asa result, voltage outputs measured in the laboratory from the prototype design matched those estimated from the electromechanical model. Through testing the effects of several components in the EHPS on electricity generation, this study confirms that using more flexible conductive asphalt mixtures and arranging more piezoelectric elements with a higher piezoelectric stress constant can increase electrical outputs from the EHPS. Regarding specific external vibration conditions, a high frequency of external vibration can lead to a dramatic effect of each piezoelectric element’s capacitance on increasing electrical outputs, but also can reduce the benefit from adding more piezoelectric elements to produce higher electrical outputs. After optimizing this EHPS prototype by adding more piezoelectric elements with higher piezoelectric stress constant and improving the flexibility of conductive asphalt mixtures, the maximum electric power from the proposed EHPS can be increased from approximately 1.2mW to 300mW under a high frequency (30Hz) external vibration. The levelized cost of electricity of this EHPS can be $19.15/kWh on a high-volume roadway within a 15-year service life.  aPublisher supplied data 3abitumen 3acapacitance 3adurability 3aelectric power 3aelectricity 3aelectricity generation 3amodels 3aroads 3avibration 0aPiezoelectric 0aEnergy harvesting pavement 0aMulti degree of freedom electromechanical model 0aLaboratory test1 aLü, Qing,0 tApplied energy.g2017 Dec. 15, v. 208 p.1071-1082dElsevier LtdwJournal:11876x0306-26197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2017.09.0453Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02825naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002500147245010800172300001600280520160900296592002801905653001901933653002001952653001501972653002101987653002902008653003002037653001702067700001702084700001902101700002302120700001602143700001702159700001702176773016702193856008202360852000902442655001202451IND60517079420221121043027.0190728e201506  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051707942DNAL7 a10.1017/S00253154140015072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBen Ltaief, Thouraya10aWhat are the factors leading to the success of small planktonic copepods in the Gulf of Gabes, Tunisia?  ap. 747-761.  aAn oceanographic cruise conducted during June 2008 in the Gulf of Gabes revealed the existence of different water masses; the Modified Atlantic Waters (MAW) circulated in the upper 100 m in the offshore area, the Mixed Mediterranean Water (MMW) was confined to the inshore region and the Ionian Water (IW) was in deep offshore water. The thermal stratification was indicated by the vertical profiles of temperature generated from a coast-offshore section. Phosphorus limitation was induced by the thermal stratification as shown by the high N/P ratio. Heterotrophic and mixotrophic dinoflagellates were the major contributors to total phytoplankton biomass. Ciliates were less abundant and dominated by tintinnids. Small planktonic copepods (≤1.45 mm) contributed to 93.64% of total copepod abundance in the inshore area as a result of the high density of Oithona similis, Oithona nana, Clausocalanus furcatus and Euterpina acutifrons in this area characterized by warm and salty MMW. In fact, small copepods were significantly correlated to both temperature and salinity. Small copepod fraction prevailed also in the MAW contributing to 71.05% of total copepod abundance as a result of the dominance of O. nana and C. furcatus. Nonetheless, the large copepod Nannocalanus minor was more adapted to the deep IW where it contributed to 44.05% of total copepod abundance. Invasive species were encountered in the offshore region intruded by the Atlantic waters. The Atlantic copepods were scarce and less abundant reflecting the weakening of the Atlantic flow in the eastern basin of the Mediterranean.  aPublisher supplied data 0asmall copepods 0adinoflagellates 0atintinnids 0ainvasive species 0aModified Atlantic Waters 0aMixed Mediterranean Water 0aIonian Water1 aDrira, Zaher1 aHannachi, Imen1 aBel Hassen, Malika1 aHamza, Asma1 aPagano, Marc1 aAyadi, Habib0 tJournal of the Marine Biological Association of the United Kingdom.g2015 June, v. 95, no. 4 p.747-761dCambridge University PresswJournal:21923x1469-77697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S00253154140015073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04564naa a2200673 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002200094024001900116024003500135040001800170100002600188245013400214300001100348506007600359520248500435592002802920506003702948650002002985650001303005650001403018650001503032650001603047650002503063650001203088650002303100650001503123650001703138650001303155650001803168650003003186650002103216650004303237650001003280650002103290650002003311650001203331650002303343650000903366650002403375650002303399650001403422650001203436650001403448650001403462650001203476650000903488650001303497650001203510650002503522700006503547700002103612700002703633773012703660856008203787852000903869655001203878IND60681787720221207094600.0220709e202012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068178772DNAL7 aPMC70768122pmcid7 a320208672pmid7 a10.1186/s12906-019-2793-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAli, Muhammad Zeeshan14aThe use of Euphorbia hirta L.

This study was designed to determine the pharmacological basis for the medicinal use of E. hirta in diarrhea and constipation. METHODS: The aqueous-methanol extract of whole herb of E. hirta (EH.Cr) and its petroleum ether (Pet.EH), chloroform (CHCl₃.EH), ethyl acetate (Et.Ac.EH) and aqueous (Aq.EH) fractions were tested in the in-vivo experiments using Balb/c mice, while the in-vitro studies were performed on isolated jejunum and ileum preparations of locally bred rabbit and Sprague Dawley rats, respectively, using PowerLab data system. RESULTS: Qualitative phytochemical analysis showed the presence of alkaloids, saponins, flavonoids, tannins, phenols, cardiac glycosides, while HPLC of EH.Cr showed quercetin in high proportion. In mice, EH.Cr at the dose of 500 and 1000 mg/kg showed 41 and 70% protection from castor oil-induced diarrhea, respectively, similar to the effect of quercetin and loperamide, while at lower doses (50 and 100 mg/kg), it caused an increase in the fecal output. In loperamide-induced constipated mice, EH.Cr also displayed laxative effect with respective values of 28.6 and 35.3% at 50 and 100 mg/kg. In rabbit jejunum, EH.Cr showed atropine-sensitive inhibitory effect in a concentration-dependent manner, while quercetin and nifedipine exhibited atropine-insensitive effects. Fractions of E. hirta also produced atropine-sensitive inhibitory effects except Pet.EH and CHCl₃.EH. On high (80 mM) and low (20 mM) K⁺ − induced contractions, the crude extract and fractions exhibited a concentration-dependent non-specific inhibition of both spasmogens and displaced concentration-response curves of Ca⁺⁺ to the right with suppression of the maximum effect similar to the effect quercetin and nifedipine. Fractions showed wide distribution of spasmolytic and Ca⁺⁺ antagonist like effects. In rat ileum, EH.Cr and its fractions exhibited atropine-sensitive gut stimulant effects except Pet.EH. CONCLUSION: The crude extract of E. hirta possesses antidiarrheal effect possibly mediated through Ca⁺⁺ antagonist like gut inhibitory constituents, while its laxative effect was mediated primarily through muscarinic receptor agonist like gut stimulant constituents. Thus, these findings provide an evidence to the folkloric use of E. hirta in diarrhea and constipation.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aEuphorbia hirta 3aagonists 3aalkaloids 3aantagonism 3aantagonists 3aantidiarrheal effect 3acalcium 3acardiac glycosides 3achloroform 3aconstipation 3adiarrhea 3aethyl acetate 3agastrointestinal diseases 3aherbal medicines 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3aileum 3ain vitro studies 3ain vivo studies 3ajejunum 3alaboratory animals 3amice 3amuscarine receptors 3aparasympatholytics 3apetroleum 3aphenols 3apotassium 3aquercetin 3arabbits 3arats 3asaponins 3atannins 3atraditional medicine1 aMehmood, Malik Hassan1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9959-14581 aSaleem, Muhammad1 aGilani, Anwarul-Hassan0 tBMC complementary medicine and therapies.g2020 Dec., v. 20, no. 1 p.14-14dBioMed CentralwJournal:27308x2662-76717nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12906-019-2793-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02579naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245010700169500001900276520138900295592002801684650001601712650001201728650001101740650002101751650001401772650001101786650001101797650001301808653001701821653002401838700005301862700001601915700001301931700001301944700001601957773011301973856008602086852000902172655001202181IND60722793720221119083253.0210226e20210505xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072279372DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhazmat.2020.1250242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBai, Shanshan10aCoating magnetite alters the mechanisms and site energy for sulfonamide antibiotic sorption on biochar  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aMagnetite-coating biochar (MBC) is a promising remediator for antibiotic contamination. Accurate models describing the sorption affinity are required to better understand the role of minerals. In this study, the presence of magnetite led to the improvements of oxygen-containing groups (i.e. C˭O) and regulation of π-systems within BC. Based on Dubinin-Ashtakhov (DA) model, the differences of site energy (Eₘ) and sorption heterogeneity (σₑ*) led to the variances between sorption capacities of sulfonamides (SAs). The positive correlations between Eₘ and the oxygen content or pore volume of MBCs indicated that π-π interactions, H-bonding, and pore-filling may act as the high energy sites. Moreover, σₑ* was related to the distribution of magnetite on BC and their porosities. These results suggested that compared to BCs, the coating minerals improved the π-interaction assisted H-bonding and proton configuration of antibiotic when sorbing on MBC. The negative correlations between the Eₘ of different SAs with their molecular sizes and solubilities resulted from steric effects and competition with water, which further confirmed the proposed high energy sites on MBCs. This study provided the insightful information of site energy distribution and understanding of fate and transport of organic pollutants on BC when the iron minerals were embedded or coated.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantibiotics 3abiochar 3aenergy 3ahydrogen bonding 3amagnetite 3amodels 3aoxygen 3asorption 0aSulfonamides 0aMean of site energy1 aJin, Chao1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6590-333X1 aZhu, Shishu1 aMa, Fang1 aWang, Li1 aWen, Qinxue0 tJournal of hazardous materials.g2021 May 05, v. 409 p.125024-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6200x0304-38947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2020.1250243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02516naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002400149245009900173300001600272520100500288592002801293650000801321650002901329650001101358650001301369650001901382650002501401650001401426650001501440650002201455650001601477650001201493653001601505653002401521653001701545653001901562653002501581653000801606653000801614653001101622700001701633700002301650700001601673700002001689700002101709700002001730700002001750773008901770856008301859990002301942852000901965655001201974IND60697478120221119195017.0200605e201601  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069747812DNAL7 a10.1016/j.virol.2015.09.0262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aColgrove, Robert C.10aHistory and genomic sequence analysis of the herpes simplex virus 1 KOS and KOS1.1 sub-strains  ap. 215-221.  aA collection of genomic DNA sequences of herpes simplex virus (HSV) strains has been defined and analyzed, and some information is available about genomic stability upon limited passage of viruses in culture. The nature of genomic change upon extensive laboratory passage remains to be determined. In this report we review the history of the HSV-1 KOS laboratory strain and the related KOS1.1 laboratory sub-strain, also called KOS (M), and determine the complete genomic sequence of an early passage stock of the KOS laboratory sub-strain and a laboratory stock of the KOS1.1 sub-strain. The genomes of the two sub-strains are highly similar with only five coding changes, 20 non-coding changes, and about twenty non-ORF sequence changes. The coding changes could potentially explain the KOS1.1 phenotypic properties of increased replication at high temperature and reduced neuroinvasiveness. The study also provides sequence markers to define the provenance of specific laboratory KOS virus stocks.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aHuman alphaherpesvirus 1 3agenome 3agenomics 3aherpes simplex 3anucleotide sequences 3aphenotype 3aprovenance 3asequence analysis 3atemperature 3aviruses 0aHSV history 0aHSV genome sequence 0aKOS sequence 0aKOS1.1sequence 0aHerpes simplex virus 0aHSV 0aKOS 0aKOS1.11 aLiu, Xueqiao1 aGriffiths, Anthony1 aRaja, Priya1 aDeluca, Neal A.1 aNewman, Ruchi M.1 aCoen, Donald M.1 aKnipe, David M.0 tVirology.g2016 Jan., v. 487 p.215-221dElsevier Inc.wJournal:2802x0042-68227nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.virol.2015.09.0263Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02875naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002200151245012000173300001600293520082300309592002801132596013701160596011801297596011201415650001701527650002101544650001701565650002301582650002601605650003601631650001101667650001501678650001801693650001801711650001001729650001601739650004801755650001501803650002001818653002001838653002801858653002201886653002001908653002701928653002301955700002201978700002502000700002202025700002302047700002302070773012202093856008502215852000902300655001202309IND60636184820221120202040.0190404e20190201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063618482DNAL7 a10.1080/14786419.2018.14550372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMedina, Rebeca P.10aAromatic compounds produced by endophytic fungi isolated from red alga Asparagopsis taxiformis - Falkenbergia stage  ap. 443-446.  aEndophytic fungi were isolated from red alga Asparagopsis taxiformis - Falkenbergia stage, collected from the Brazilian coast, and were identified as Annulohypoxylon stygium (AT-03) and A. yungensis (AT-06) based on their macro/micromorphological and molecular features. Bioassay-guided fractionation of the EtOAc extract from laboratory cultures of both strains yielded known compounds pyrogallol from A. stygium, (3R)-scytalone and (3R,4R)-4-hydroxy-scytalone from A. yungensis. Pyrogallol was active against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Escherichia coli strains. An inactive fraction from A. stygium afforded two additional compounds, (3R,4R)-3,4,5-trihydroxy-1-tetralone and tyrosol. Optically active compounds had their stereochemistry determined by circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy.  aPublisher supplied data  a311906/2015-0a474270/2012-2cConselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológicodhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100003593  a3334/15-5cCoordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superiordhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100002322  a13/07600-3cFundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado de São Paulodhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100001807 3aAsparagopsis 3aEscherichia coli 3aFalkenbergia 3aactive ingredients 3aantibiotic resistance 3acircular dichroism spectroscopy 3acoasts 3aendophytes 3aethyl acetate 3afractionation 3afungi 3amethicillin 3amethicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus 3apyrogallol 3astereochemistry 0aMarine red alga 0aAsparagopsis taxiformis 0aendophytic fungus 0aAnnulohypoxylon 0aantimicrobial activity 0aaromatic compounds1 aAraujo, Angela R.1 aAndersen, Raymond J.1 aSoares, Marcos A.1 aSilva, Fabio de A.1 aSilva, Dulce H.

In the forest-steppe and mountain taiga zones of the Kuznetsk Coal Basin, argillites, siltstones, and sandstones are the overburden and enclosing rocks. They are responsible for the alkaline reaction and the same microelement composition in almost all the soils studied. The nonselective formation of the dumps and the predominance of the coarse fraction in the rocks composing the dumps is a cause of the wide distribution of petrozems and humus petrozems on their surface. The presence of a great amount of coal particles in the substrates and the incorrect planning of the dumps may be the reasons for their self-ignition, which can change the composition of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in the soils of the dumps.  aPublisher supplied data 3aargillite 3acoal 3ahumus 3aparent rock 3aplanning 3apolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons 3asoil 3ataiga1 aTsibart, A.

Site specific best management practices (BMP) are needed to curb erosion and sediment control and in turn, increase productivity of lands and sustain environmental quality. The aim of this study was to investigate the effectiveness of three different types of biodegradable erosion control blankets- fine compost, mulch, and 50–50 mixture of compost and mulch, for soil erosion control under field and laboratory-scale experiments. Quantitative analysis was conducted by comparing the sediment load in the runoff collected from sloped and tilled plots in the field and in the laboratory with the erosion control blankets. The field plots had an average slope of 3.5% and experiments were conducted under natural rainfall conditions, while the laboratory experiments were conducted at 4, 8 and 16% slopes under simulated rainfall conditions. Results obtained from the field experiments indicated that the 50–50 mixture of compost and mulch provides the best erosion control measures as compared to using either the compost or the mulch blanket alone. Laboratory results under simulated rains indicated that both mulch cover and the 50–50 mixture of mulch and compost cover provided better erosion control measures compared to using the compost alone. Although these results indicate that the 50–50 mixtures and the mulch in laboratory experiments are the best measures among the three erosion control blankets, all three types of blankets provide very effective erosion control measures from bare-soil surface. Results of this study can be used in controlling erosion and sediment from disturbed lands with compost mulch application. Testing different mixture ratios and types of mulch and composts, and their efficiencies in retaining various soil nutrients may provide more quantitative data for developing erosion control plans.  aPublisher supplied data 3abest management practices 3acomposts 3acontrol methods 3aenvironmental quality 3aerosion control 3afield experimentation 3aland degradation 3aland productivity 3apollution load 3aquantitative analysis 3arain 3arainfall simulation 3arunoff 3asediments 3asoil nutrients 3atopsoil 3awater erosion 3awind 2aSoil 0aIllinois1 aKalita, Prasanta K.1 aYatsu, Shotaro1 aHoward, Heidi R.1 aSvendsen, Niels G.0 tJournal of environmental management.g2011 Mar., v. 92, no. 3 p.803-812dElsevier Ltdx0301-47977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2010.10.0283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03161naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245007900165300001800244520189500262592002802157596006902185650002302254650001702277650002302294650001102317650001302328650001402341650001302355650001102368650002202379650002602401650001302427700005702440700003302497700001702530773012402547856008302671852000902754655001202763IND60782386820221123001557.0220822e202206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078238682DNAL7 a10.1007/s11033-022-07355-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMaryam, Hira10aGhCDNC and GhCYP706B1 genes mediate gossypol biosynthesis in upland cotton  ap. 4919-4928.  aBACKGROUND: In cotton the identification and characterization of natural defense is a cost-effective, sustainable, and environment-friendly strategy to combat cotton pests. The secondary metabolites traits in cotton plant i.e., toxic gossypol glands play significant role for development and self-defense mechanism. To utilize gossypol in breeding implements, the understanding of gossypol initiation biosynthesis genes has vital importance at reproductive organ development stages. METHODS: Cotton germplasm of 100 genotypes screened visually based on gossypol glandedness and a core set of ten genotypes was developed. Further three genotypes FH-330 (high glanding), F-280 (low glanding) and IRMA-197 (glandless) were used for determining the transcript abundance of twelve gossypol biosynthesis genes. RESULTS: Out of 100, germplasm categorized as (76) high glanding, (22) medium glanding), one genotype for each (low glanding) and (glandless) category. Real-time qPCR analysis revealed varied expression patterns among selected three genotypes. Out of twelve, three genes CYP706B1, CDNC and 2ODD-1 had strong expression levels in all tested tissues in high glanded genotype, while, slight or no expression of these genes was recorded in low glanding and glandless genotype, respectively. The shell of developing boll (10, 20, 30 DPA), and developing embryo (20, 30 DPA) showed substantially medium to maximum expression, respectively while high to medium expression was recorded in sepals and leaf tissue. CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrated that CYP706B1, CDNC and 2ODD-1 are the most promising genes involved in gossypol biosynthesis. Developing boll shell, developing embryo, leaf and sepal also have significant ability to synthesize gossypol. This will provide scientists a way to manipulate gossypol contents in economically important organs of cotton plant for targeted breeding.  aPublisher supplied data  aADP 22036-AgriculturecDivision of Institution and Award Support 3aGossypium hirsutum 3abiosynthesis 3acost effectiveness 3acotton 3agenotype 3agermplasm 3agossypol 3aleaves 3amolecular biology 3asecondary metabolites 3atoxicity1 aAli, Zulfiqar1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1228-33381 aSaddique, Muhammad Abu Bakar1 aNawaz, Fahim0 tMolecular biology reports.g2022 June, v. 49, no. 6 p.4919-4928dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl5510x0301-48517nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11033-022-07355-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02325naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245015500168300001800323500001900341520096600360536013201326592002801458596008201486650002501568650001201593651001101605653002801616653003201644653001801676700002001694700001801714700001801732773011901750856008501869852000901954655001201963IND60705332720221121132000.0200803e20200909xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070533272DNAL7 a10.1080/10106049.2018.15598862doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLee, Re-Yang10aEvaluation of crop mapping on fragmented and complex slope farmlands through random forest and object-oriented analysis using unmanned aerial vehicles  ap. 1293-1310.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aConducting field research in Taiwan can be challenging because of the abundance of steep slopes. This study aimed to establish an automatic interpretation procedure applicable to exploring images of large-scale slope land taken using UAVs. The proposed method was compared with traditional field surveying and manual image interpretation techniques to determine the advantages and disadvantages of the proposed procedure in terms of efficiency. The object-based image analysis (OBIA) and texture features were first combined and the random forest (RF) classifier was then employed to interpret crop types. This study selected three sites of slope land and plains for experimentation. The obtained results indicated that the overall accuracy of the proposed classification method exceeded 91%, and the Kappa value was approximately 0.9 for all sites. In addition, interpretation of the proposed method was more efficient than that of the two traditional methods.  aThis work was supported by the Agriculture and Food Agency, Council of Agriculture, R.O.C. under Grant number 106 AFA-1.4-P-01.  aPublisher supplied data  a106 AFA-1.4-P-01cAgriculture and Food Agency, Council of Agriculture, R.O.C. 3aimage interpretation 3atexture 3aTaiwan 0aUnmanned aerial vehicle 0aobject-based image analysis 0arandom forest1 aChang, Kuo-Chen1 aOu, Deng-Yuan1 aHsu, Chia-Hui0 tGeocarto international.g2020 Sept. 9, v. 35, no. 12 p.1293-1310dTaylor & FranciswJournal:12366x1752-07627nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10106049.2018.15598863Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02589naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100005500150245011600205520118100321592002801502650002101530650001901551650002201570650002801592650000901620650001801629650001601647650003001663653002201693653002201715653003101737653004201768653002201810700001501832700005701847700001701904700001901921700001801940700001301958773009001971856008502061852000902146655001202155IND60680727820221122052530.0200217e20200301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068072782DNAL7 a10.1016/j.energy.2019.1168732doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXu, Zhiheng1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9229-855810aElectrodeposition preparation and optimization of fan-shaped miniaturized radioisotope thermoelectric generator  aIn view of the current energy demand for miniaturized equipment in extreme environmental fields, such as in deep space exploration. A new fan-shaped radioisotope thermoelectric generator is innovatively presented and designed. Thin-film thermoelectric materials used for miniaturized radioisotope thermoelectric generators are first prepared by electrochemical methods. The prepared fan-shaped radioisotope thermoelectric generator has a volume of 5.75 cm³ and consists of 8 thermoelectric modules and 32 thermoelectric legs. The study finds that when a 1.5 W heat source is loaded, the temperature difference of the device is 54.8 K, the output voltage and the maximum output power is 174.88 mV and 333.20 nW, respectively. On this basis, the number and size of the modules are optimized by the finite element method. When the thermoelectric leg size is optimized to 9 × 2 mm² and the number of modules is 8, the maximum output power can be up to 369.02 nW. The corresponding experimental verification work is further developed and discussed. This work provides a novel solution for the energy supply problem of small-volume devices in extreme space environments.  aPublisher supplied data 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectroplating 3afilms (materials) 3afinite element analysis 3aheat 3aradionuclides 3atemperature 3athermoelectric generators 0aEnergy conversion 0aBismuth telluride 0aBismuth antimony telluride 0aRadioisotope thermoelectric generator 0aElectrodeposition1 aLi, Junqin1 aTang, Xiaobin1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3308-04681 aLiu, Yunpeng1 aJiang, Tongxin1 aYuan, Zicheng1 aLiu, Kai0 tEnergy.g2020 Mar. 01, v. 194 p.116873-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12436x0360-54427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2019.1168733Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01967naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001500147245006200162300001800224520092300242592002801165650001301193650001401206650000901220650002001229650001901249650002401268650001201292650001601304650002201320700001401342700001901356700001601375773012301391856008201514852000901596655001201605IND60627420120221117021833.0220430e200809  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062742012DNAL7 a10.1007/s10853-008-2874-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHansen, N.10aThermal stability of aluminum cold rolled to large strain  ap. 6254-6259.  aCommon to metals deformed to high strains is a very fine microstructure, high strength, and limited ductility. Structure and property optimization by annealing after deformation must, therefore, be explored. In the present study, commercial purity aluminum has been annealed after cold rolling to ultrahigh strains up to [Formula: see text] and annealing processes have been studied in terms of recovery and conventional recrystallization. These processes have been analyzed by isochronal and isothermal annealing in the temperature range 140–420 °C. It has been found that the recrystallization temperature is a little affected by the rolling strain, whereas the rate of recovery and the temperature range over which recovery takes place increase significantly as the strain is increased. These observations are discussed as to how they can guide studies of nanostructured metals processed by plastic deformation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaluminum 3aannealing 3acold 3acrystallization 3amicrostructure 3aplastic deformation 3arolling 3atemperature 3athermal stability1 aHuang, X.1 aMøller, M.

Informed by our soil color investigations using both the Munsell Soil Color Chart (MSCC) and the Nix in forested wetlands of the northern Virginia area, we crafted a standard operating procedure (SOP), adaptable to various locations and/or soil types, that guides users—regardless of knowledge of soil ecology or familiarity with the Nix—to successfully assess and monitor soil colors at various depths. Our SOP outlines steps for digitally collecting, storing, and sharing soil color data. Through the implementation of this procedure, soil color monitoring can enter the digital age, removing barriers of entry to soil color determination and enhancing individuals’ interest in monitoring and understanding of the importance of soil color as an environmental and ecological indicator. With continued refinement and adaptation to intended use, the SOP herein presented has the potential to aid wetland/watershed assessment by providing data on soil colors that can be tracked over time while also encouraging public engagement in environmental monitoring of soils.  aPublisher supplied data 3acitizen participation 3acolor 3aenvironmental indicators 3alowland forests 3asoil color 3asoil ecology 3awatersheds 3awetlands 3aVirginia1 aAhn, Changwoo1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0747-29030 tEnvironmental monitoring and assessment.g2022 Oct., v. 194, no. 10 p.726-726dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:jnl33242x0167-63697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-022-10420-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03035naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245016400168520142000332592002801752650001501780650001501795650001101810650001301821650001901834650001301853650001701866650001801883650001701901650001801918650001801936650000701954650001501961650001901976650001701995650002302012650002502035653001602060653002502076653002402101653002202125653002202147700001202169700001802181700001502199700001502214700001802229700001302247700001202260773011402272856008602386852000902472655001202481IND60686563420221121225628.0201104e20200615xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068656342DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhazmat.2020.1224962doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXie, Yaqiang10aRemoval of anionic hexavalent chromium and methyl orange pollutants by using imidazolium-based mesoporous poly(ionic liquid)s as efficient adsorbents in column  aPoly(ionic liquid)s (PILs) are attractive for their various applications, but the use of porous PILs have rarely been reported in anionic pollutants removal via ion-exchange by column. Herein, we report a serial of crosslinked imidazolium-based mesoporous PILs with Cl⁻ and Br⁻ as anions for hexavalent chromium (Cr(VI)) and methyl orange (MO) removal. Among them, PDVIm-Cl-SCD, from the free-radical polymerization of a dicationic monomer (N,N'-methylene-bis(1-(3-vinylimidazolium)) chloride, DVIm-Cl) and further supercritical carbon dioxide drying (SCD), displayed a very high sorption capacity (328.2 mg g⁻¹ at 25 °C) and excellent utilization of adsorption sites (UOA, 86.2%) towards Cr(VI), and an unprecedentedly high sorption capacity (1615.0 mg g⁻¹ at 25 °C) with a UOA of 67.4% to MO. Moreover, PDVIm-Cl-SCD also exhibited a broad pH range, excellent regeneration and remarkable reusability. Regarding to Cr(VI) removal, the volume of saturated KCl aqueous used for regenerating the Cr(VI) saturated PDVIm-Cl-SCD column (7.5–9.5 mL) was much less than the volume of treated Cr(VI) solution (160–200 mL). For MO removal, the volume of saturated NaCl solution used for regenerating the MO saturated PDVIm-Cl-SCD column (10.5–13.5 mL) was also much less than the volume of treated MO solution (220–235 mL), implying the great potential of PDVIm-Cl-SCD in sustainable wastewater treatment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorbents 3aadsorption 3aanions 3abromides 3acarbon dioxide 3achromium 3acrosslinking 3afree radicals 3aion exchange 3aionic liquids 3amethyl orange 3apH 3apollutants 3apolymerization 3aporous media 3apotassium chloride 3awastewater treatment 0aImidazolium 0aMesoporous materials 0aPoly(ionic liquid)s 0aPollutant removal 0aColumn adsorption1 aLin, Ju1 aLin, Hongying1 aJiang, Yue1 aLiang, Jun1 aWang, Hongtao1 aTu, Song1 aLi, Jun0 tJournal of hazardous materials.g2020 June 15, v. 392 p.122496-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6200x0304-38947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2020.1224963Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02796naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100002200154245014200176300001600318500001900334500002000353520141300373592002801786650000901814650002201823650001301845650001801858650001301876650001801889650000901907650001801916650001801934650001201952650001501964650001301979650002401992650002602016650002102042650000802063650001202071650001102083700002002094773011502114856008802229852000902317655001202326IND60734209220221120174059.0210415e200511  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073420922DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1469-8137.2005.01501.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aO'Looney, Nichola14aThe novel herbicide oxaziclomefone inhibits cell expansion in maize cell cultures without affecting turgor pressure or wall acidification  ap. 323-329.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  a• Oxaziclomefone [OAC; IUPAC name 3‐(1‐(3,5‐dichlorophenyl)‐1‐methylethyl)‐3,4‐dihydro‐6‐methyl‐5‐phenyl‐2H‐1,3‐oxazin‐4‐one] is a new herbicide that inhibits cell expansion in grass roots. Its effects on cell cultures and mode of action were unknown. In principle, cell expansion could be inhibited by a decrease in either turgor pressure or wall extensibility. • Cell expansion was estimated as settled cell volume; cell division was estimated by cell counting. Membrane permeability to water was measured by a novel method involving simultaneous assay of the efflux of ³H₂O and [¹⁴C]mannitol from a ‘bed’ of cultured cells. Osmotic potential was measured by depression of freezing point. • OAC inhibited cell expansion in cultures of maize (Zea mays), spinach (Spinacia oleracea) and rose (Rosa sp.), with an ID₅₀ of 5, 30 and 250 nm, respectively. In maize cultures, OAC did not affect cell division for the first 40 h. It did not affect the osmotic potential of cell sap or culture medium, nor did it impede water transport across cell membranes. It did not affect cells’ ability to acidify the apoplast (medium), which may be necessary for ‘acid growth’. • As OAC did not diminish turgor pressure, its ability to inhibit cell expansion must depend on changes in wall extensibility. It could be a valuable tool for studies on cell expansion.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRosa 3aSpinacia oleracea 3aZea mays 3aacidification 3aapoplast 3acell division 3acorn 3aculture media 3aextensibility 3agrasses 3aherbicides 3amannitol 3amechanism of action 3amembrane permeability 3aosmotic pressure 3asap 3aspinach 3aturgor1 aFry, Stephen C.0 tnew phytologist.g2005 Nov., v. 168, no. 2 p.323-329dBlackwell Science LtdwJournal:jnl44665x0028-646X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1469-8137.2005.01501.x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02657naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001800152245014900170300001600319520104100335592002801376650004401404650001801448650001701466650001801483650002001501650002001521650000901541650002401550650001801574650000701592650001101599650001601610650003701626653001501663653002701678653002601705653001301731700001901744700001901763700001901782700002301801700001701824700002101841700001901862700002501881700001901906773010601925856008702031852000902118655001202127IND60526747520221123010414.0190409e201608  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052674752DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biortech.2016.05.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSingh, Vishal10aMetallic/bimetallic magnetic nanoparticle functionalization for immobilization of α-amylase for enhanced reusability in bio-catalytic processes  ap. 528-533.  aNovel magnetic nanoparticles coated with silica and gold were synthesized for immobilization of α-amylase enzyme and characterized with Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy. Effect of various limiting factors such as substrate concentration, temperature, and pH on the catalytic activity of enzyme was investigated. The optimum pH for free and immobilized enzyme was found unaffected (7.0), whereas optimum temperature for the enzyme activity was increased from 60°C for free enzyme to 80°C for immobilized counterpart. The gains in catalytic attributes concomitant to ease of recovery of the enzyme reflect the potential of the approach and the product to be useful for the enzymatic bioprocessing. The Michaelis–Menten constant (Km) value of the immobilized α-amylase was higher than that of free α-amylase, whereas maximum velocity (Vmax), and turn over number (Kcat), values were almost similar.

Microscopical observations confirmed this result and showed a gradient of starch content in different regions of bud in which the foliars primordiums and scales were the starch richer. Buds conservation at 2°C reduced their starch content but this decrease begun only after 9 days of chilling corresponding to the time necessary for budbreak and for the beginning of increase the bud burst ability. The hydrolysis of starch seems begun at the first in apex and then propaged to the other regions of bud. In the scales, the most exposed region to cold, storage at 2°C during 56 days induced an increase of cellular tannins content and cell walls polysaccharides. These results were discuted in relation to the increase of bud burst ability and to their cold acclimatation.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aVitis vinifera 3abudbreak 3acold 3acold storage 3adormancy 3ahydrolysis 3amicroscopy 3aphotons 3astarch 0aVitis vinifera L. 0alatent bud 0astarch 0atannins 0acell walls polysaccharids 0acell structure 0achilling1 aCholet, Céline1 aCherrad, Monique0 tOENO One.g2001 Dec., v. 35, no. 4 p.207-214dInternational Viticulture and Enology SocietywJournal:27875x2494-12717nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.20870/oeno-one.2001.35.4.9833Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02671naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100001900112245008200131300001800213500001900231520171300250592002801963650001401991650001102005650001602016650001302032650002102045650001302066653002302079653004102102700001902143700002002162773015402182852000902336655001202345IND60723772720221121031855.0210117e201509  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072377272DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAgrawal, Neetu10aEconomic Analysis of Mustard Production in Kabirdham District of Chhattisgarh  ap. 4639-4643.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe present study was conducted with a view to economics analysis of mustard production in Kabirdham district of Chhattisgarh. Out of fourteen districts of Chhattisgarh plain zone, Kabirdham district was selected purposively. The district has four blocks, out of these; two blocks i.e. Kawardha and Lohara are were further selected for the study. Six numbers of villages from both the selected blocks and ten farmers from each of the selected village were taken in to consideration to collect the required information. Therefore, sixty farmers from each selected blocks were selected for the purpose. In all, 120 numbers of mustard growers were sampled for the study. The overall cost of cultivation of mustard was observed as Rs. 16617.50 per hectare. Average cost of production of mustard was worked out in Rs/q and found to be Rs. 1629.16 irrespective to the farm size. It reveals that irrespective to the farms size, the net income earned by farmers was Rs/ha.18579.49. The input-output ratio was found to be 1: 2.12 and benefit of Rs 1.12 in per rupee investment on mustard cultivation. The net income earned by farmers was found to be increasing with farm size of holding and ranging from Rs. 16177.83 to Rs. 18579.49 of marginal to large farm size of holdings. Under oilseed production, some of the constraints was noticed which are essential to understand the real practices performed for oilseeds cultivation in the study area. The elicitation of sample farmer's with regard to production of oilseeds was decreasing the yield of oilseeds due to cultivation of same crop since long period of time, which was reported by 88.33 per cent and lack of availability of fund in proper time (79.16 per cent).  aPublisher supplied data 3afarm size 3aincome 3alarge farms 3aoilseeds 3aproduction costs 3avillages 0aCost of Production 0aCost Concepts and Marketable surplus1 aPathak, Hulash1 aPallewar, Sarju0 tTrends in Biosciences.g2015 Sept., v. 8, no. 17 p.4639-4643dSociety for Advancement of Science and Rural DevelopmentwJournal:2106x0976-24857nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle02491naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245010500163300002000268520133400288592002801622650001201650650001001662650001301672650002701685650002601712650001701738650002001755650001301775650000901788700001801797700001801815700002001833700002401853773015001877856008102027852000902108655001202117IND60440193320221119035612.0151024e201509  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6044019332DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-015-4666-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKhlifi, Rim10aAssociation between blood arsenic levels and nasal polyposis disease risk in the Tunisian population  ap. 14136-14143.  aAlthough the pathophysiology underlying nasal polyposis (NP) formation is not fully understood, systemic, local, and environmental factors appear to contribute to NP disease development. This study aimed to explore the relationship between metal blood levels and NP risk. To the best of our knowledge, the current research represents the first scientific contribution reporting levels of Cr and As in blood of NP patients. In this context, 90 NP patients and 171 controls were recruited and blood samples were analyzed to determine the concentrations of As and Cr. Metal blood levels of As in patients (2.1 μg/L) were significantly higher than those of controls (1.2 μg/L). However, no significant difference in blood Cr levels was found between cases and controls. Arsenic blood levels of cigarette smokers were significantly higher than those of non-smokers. Environmental exposure and shisha consumption presented the most significant association with NP disease (OR = 10.1 and 14.1, respectively). High levels of blood As were significantly associated with NP disease (OR = 2.1). Cr blood levels were found to be associated with the four stages of polyps in both nasal cavities. This study found a strong association between nasal polyposis disease and As blood levels. These findings merit further investigation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aarsenic 3ablood 3achromium 3aenvironmental exposure 3aenvironmental factors 3anasal cavity 3apathophysiology 3apatients 3arisk1 aOlmedo, Pablo1 aGil, Fernando1 aChakroun, Amine1 aHamza-Chaffai, Amel0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research international.g2015 Sept., v. 22, no. 18 p.14136-14143dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx0944-13447nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-015-4666-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02643naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094024002200130024001900152040001800171100001700189245010400206300001600310520107500326592002801401650002101429650001801450650001701468650001001485650001601495650002501511650001801536650001601554650001701570650001001587650001801597650000901615650002601624650003001650700001901680700002201699700001501721700002801736700002201764700002401786700002501810700001901835700002501854700001801879773009001897856008201987990002302069852000902092655001202101IND60092823320221121005131.0141103e20121003xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009282332DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cmet.2012.09.0042doi7 aPMC34754192pmcid7 a230400702pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSo, Jae-Seon10aSilencing of Lipid Metabolism Genes through IRE1α-Mediated mRNA Decay Lowers Plasma Lipids in Mice  ap. 487-499.  aXBP1 is a key regulator of the unfolded protein response (UPR), which is involved in a wide range of physiological and pathological processes. XBP1 ablation in liver causes profound hypolipidemia in mice, highlighting its critical role in lipid metabolism. XBP1 deficiency triggers feedback activation of its upstream enzyme IRE1α, instigating regulated IRE1-dependent decay (RIDD) of cytosolic mRNAs. Here, we identify RIDD as a crucial control mechanism of lipid homeostasis. Suppression of RIDD by RNA interference or genetic ablation of IRE1α reversed hypolipidemia in XBP1-deficient mice. Comprehensive microarray analysis of XBP1 and/or IRE1α-deficient liver identified genes involved in lipogenesis and lipoprotein metabolism as RIDD substrates, which might contribute to the suppression of plasma lipid levels by activated IRE1α. Ablation of XBP1 ameliorated hepatosteatosis, liver damage, and hypercholesterolemia in dyslipidemic animal models, suggesting that direct targeting of either IRE1α or XBP1 might be a feasible strategy to treat dyslipidemias.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRNA interference 3aanimal models 3ablood lipids 3agenes 3ahomeostasis 3ahypercholesterolemia 3ahypolipidemia 3alipogenesis 3alipoproteins 3aliver 3amessenger RNA 3amice 3amicroarray technology 3aunfolded protein response1 aHur, Kyu Yeon1 aTarrio, Margarite1 aRuda, Vera1 aFrank-Kamenetsky, Maria1 aFitzgerald, Kevin1 aKoteliansky, Victor1 aLichtman, Andrew H.,1 aIwawaki, Takao1 aGlimcher, Laurie H.1 aLee, Ann-Hwee0 tCell metabolism.g2012 Oct. 3, v. 16, no. 4 p.487-499dElsevier Inc.x1550-41317nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cmet.2012.09.0043Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle04009naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002100146245011600167300001300283506002800296520271400324592002803038506003703066650001303103650000803116650000903124650002503133650002403158650001703182650000903199650001103208650001903219650001703238653002903255653001103284653002603295653001503321700001903336700001503355773011503370856008103485852000903566655001203575IND60739574920221207121447.0210222e202004  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073957492DNAL7 a10.17969/rtp.v13i1.158562doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSirait, Sudirman10aAnalisis Neraca Air dan Kebutuhan Air Tanaman Jagung (Zea Mays L.)

Analysis of Water Balance and Crop Water Requirements of Corn (Zea mays L.) Based on Growth Phases in Tarakan City Abstract. The effort to increase the productivity of corn plants is the provision of sufficient water for plant growth. Corn is a plant that needs water for the process of growth and development. The accuracy of the water supply following the growth phase of corn plants is very influential in production. Excess and deficiency of water will cause corn plants to decrease in the process of growth and production. This study aims to analyze the water balance and crop water requirements in corn-based on the growth phase in the City of Tarakan. This research was divided into several stages, namely the collection of monthly climate data for the period 2008-2017, analysis of water balance by using Thornthwaite-Mather method, and analysis of corn crop water requirements based on the growth phase. The results showed that (1) the Tarakan City area had a rainfall of 3497.68 mm/year. (2) The rainfall surplus is 2997.84 mm/year, runoff 1630.31 mm/year, and groundwater recharge 1367.53 mm/year. (3) During the one planting period, corn plants require an average of 256.55 mm of water. (4) The consumptive use (ETc) of corn plants during the 4 planting periods is 1026.18 mm/year and has a very adequate water supply and every month has more value throughout the year.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aZea mays 3aair 3acorn 3agroundwater recharge 3ameteorological data 3aplant growth 3arain 3arunoff 3awater analysis 3awater supply 0afase pertumbuhan tanaman 0ajagung 0akebutuhan air tanaman 0aneraca air1 aAprilia, Linda1 aFachruddin0 tRona Teknik Pertanian.g2020 Apr., v. 13, no. 1 p.1-12dSyiah Kuala UniversitywJournal:27803x2528-26547nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.17969/rtp.v13i1.158563Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02467naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100005500151245012900206520124500335592002801580650001401608650001701622650000901639650001301648650001901661650001401680650001301694650001701707653002801724653001401752653001501766653001901781700001301800700001801813700001301831700001601844773011401860856008601974852000902060655001202069IND60686563820221122052915.0201104e20200615xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068656382DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhazmat.2020.1225002doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiang, Qian1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8348-083312aA novel 2D/1D core-shell heterostructures coupling MOF-derived iron oxides with ZnIn2S4 for enhanced photocatalytic activity  a1D spindle-like iron oxides with controllable phase were synthesized by using MIL-88A-templated pyrolysis under different atmospheres, thermal annealing in N₂ to obtain Fe₃O₄ and in air to obtain α-Fe₂O₃. Then, 2D/1D core-shell heterostructures (ZnIn₂S₄@Fe₃O₄ and ZnIn₂S₄@α-Fe₂O₃) were constructed by in-situ self-assembly strategy. Characterizations indicated that the 2D ultra-thin ZnIn₂S₄ shell with 0.3 μm was homogeneously coated on the surface of 1D Fe₃O₄/α-Fe₂O₃ core with 1 μm, and ZnIn₂S₄@Fe₃O₄ exhibited higher BET surface area (84.5 m² g⁻¹) compared with ZnIn₂S₄@α-Fe₂O₃ (17.8 m² g⁻¹), providing more exposed active sites and larger contact area. The ZnIn₂S₄@Fe₃O₄-5 showed the best photocatalytic activity of RhB degradation as compared to ZnIn₂S₄, Fe₃O₄ and ZnIn₂S₄@α-Fe₂O₃. In addition, the degradation rates of MB, BPA and MO over ZnIn₂S₄@Fe₃O₄ were much higher than that of ZnIn₂S₄@α-Fe₂O₃. The proposed photocatalytic mechanism was also discussed: the Fe₃O₄ as an electron acceptor caused Fe³⁺/Fe²⁺ cycle in ZnIn₂S₄@Fe₃O₄ and ZnIn₂S₄@α-Fe₂O₃ followed the Z-scheme mechanism.  aPublisher supplied data 3aannealing 3aferric oxide 3airon 3anitrogen 3aphotocatalysis 3apyrolysis 3asulfides 3asurface area 0aMetal organic framework 0aPyrolysis 0aCore-shell 0aPhotocatalysis1 aGao, Wen1 aLiu, Changhai1 aXu, Song1 aLi, Zhongyu0 tJournal of hazardous materials.g2020 June 15, v. 392 p.122500-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6200x0304-38947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2020.1225003Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02419naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100001900112245012600131300001800257500001900275520109900294592002801393650001701421650002601438650001501464650002601479650001301505650001601518650001501534650001401549650001701563650001301580650001301593650000901606650002101615650001001636651001001646653002901656653002201685653002601707653002001733700002101753700002401774773015401798852000901952655001201961IND60723773020221120140652.0210117e201509  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072377302DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNegalur, R.

A shear thinning behavior was observed in all of the EWA-BSG mixtures. Herschel-Bulkley and Carreau were selected as the best models for describing the flow behavior data in the mixtures made at pH 7.0 and 5.0, respectively. All of the viscoelastic parameters (i.e. G′LVE, G″LVE, tan (δ)LVE, and τf) indicated a stronger structure at the highest pressure (400 MPa) and the lower pH (5.0). The value of material stiff parameters (Aα) indicated that pH 5.0 resulted in a higher amount of molecular binding between EWA and BSG. Relaxation function (α) decreased with increase in pressure level, meaning that a greater degree of the possible interactions happened at the higher pressure. None of the EWA-BSG solutions followed Cox-Merz rule. The temperature of reinforcement of the gel network (Tr) in the EWA-BSG mixtures decreased from ∼66 °C at pH 7.0–∼55 °C at pH 5.0, and the storage modulus of the mixtures varied depending on the pH. The highest complex viscosity (after heating step) belonged to the sample prepared at pH 5.0 and treated with 400 MPa. Overall, it was found that HPP, alone or combined with pH treatment, could improve the structure of the egg white albumin and basil seed gum mixtures.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalbumins 3abasil 3aegg albumen 3agels 3ahigh pressure treatment 3ahydrocolloids 3amodels 3apH 3aplant gums 3astorage modulus 3atemperature 3aviscoelasticity 3aviscosity 0aComplex viscosity 0aEWA-BSG mixtures 0aElectrostatic interactions 0aHigh-pressure processing 0apH effect 0aRheological properties1 aMotamedzadegan, Ali1 aMatia-Merino, Lara1 aShahidi, Seyed-Ahmad1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5667-28751 aRashidinejad, Ali0 tFood hydrocolloids.g2019 Sept., v. 94 p.399-410dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46643x0268-005X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodhyd.2019.03.0293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02821naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245008300165300001600248520164000264592002801904650002101932650002301953650001601976650001101992650001802003650001302021650001602034650001902050650001502069651002402084651001002108700003302118700001702151700002802168700001802196773011902214856008102333852000902414655001202423IND60121243620221119160125.0150219e201503  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012124362DNAL7 a10.1007/s10546-014-9981-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHicks, B. B.,10aOn the Micrometeorology of the Southern Great Plains. 2: Turbulence Statistics  ap. 351-366.  aFast-response micrometeorological data obtained from an instrumented 32-m tower at an arid site near Ocotillo, Texas are used to examine the daily time evolution of the lower atmosphere. Correlation coefficients between turbulence properties (fast response wind-speed components and temperature) confirm that over this sparsely vegetated site the effects of convection are observed soon after sunrise, well ahead of the morning transition from stable to unstable stratification. Details of this kind are obscured when results are considered as functions of conventional stability parameters, since such standard analytical methods combine features of the morning and evening transitions into a single presentation. Partial correlation coefficients and semi-partials indicate that the local turbulent kinetic energy is mainly associated with local fluxes of heat and momentum near neutral and in most stable conditions, but decreases substantially during the times of strongest instability (possibly reflecting the scatter introduced by sampling infrequent convective episodes using a single tower). For many of the variables considered here, the standard deviations are about the same as the linear averages, indicating that the distributions are close to log-normal. The present data indicate that if the intent is to address some specific situation then ± 10 % error bounds on turbulence quantities (e.g. fluxes) correspond to averaging over a distance scale of the order of 10 km and a time scale of about 3 h. As the distance and time scales become smaller, the uncertainties due to factors external to the local surface increase.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEarth atmosphere 3aanalytical methods 3acorrelation 3aenergy 3aheat transfer 3amomentum 3atemperature 3aturbulent flow 3awind speed 3aGreat Plains region 3aTexas1 aPendergrass, W.

Overcrowding has adverse effects on ER services. Overcrowding obstructs therapeutic procedures, such as sepsis treatment. This study aimed to determine the relationship between the ER overcrowding and sepsis patients’ management based on the Hour-1 Sepsis Bundle. The study was an analytic observational study on 38 septic patients in critical emergency rooms. The observation recorded time until triage, occupancy rate, length of stay (LOS) in the emergency room, number of staff in the emergency room, boarding time, the percentage of boarders, and sepsis management’s suitability based on Hour-1 Sepsis Bundle. There was no significant relationship between ER overcrowding and suitability of Hour-1 Sepsis Bundle as a whole. However, based on the analysis between independent variables and each bundle component, there was a significant relationship between time until triage and blood culture examinations (p = 0.037). Besides, the occupancy rate has a significant relationship with the measurement of serum lactate levels (p = 0.023). Furthermore, there is a significant relationship between total ER staff and ER junior staff on antibiotics administration (p = 0.038 and p = 0.013). The time until triage influenced blood culture examinations, (p = 0.037), occupancy rate influenced the measurement of serum lactate levels, and the total ER staff and ER junior team influenced antibiotic administration.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aantibiotics 3ablood serum 3ahospitals 3alactic acid 3aobservational studies 3atherapeutics 0aovercrowding 0atime until triage 0aoccupancy rate 0ahour-1 sepsis bundle 0asepsis 0aseptic shock 0alos 0aboarding time 0aboarders1 aDradjat, R.S.1 aPrasetyadjati, A.1 aFreddy, A.1 aEko, A.S.1 aSetijowati, N.1 aSasmito, P.0 tBiotika.g2021 Feb., v. 38, no. 1 p.3-10dBiotikawJournal:27865x2410-92907nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle02616naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002000152245020200172300001600374520114000390592002801530650002401558650001501582650001501597650001301612650000901625650001101634650001501645650001401660650002401674650003301698650001601731653002501747653001201772653001401784653003301798653001301831653002601844700001801870700001901888700001901907700001801926773010601944856008702050852000902137655001202146IND60526747820221122221344.0190409e201608  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052674782DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biortech.2016.05.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJung, Kyung-Won10aPreparation of modified-biochar from Laminaria japonica: Simultaneous optimization of aluminum electrode-based electro-modification and pyrolysis processes and its application for phosphate removal  ap. 548-557.  aThe preparation conditions of electro-modification (current density) and pyrolysis (pyrolysis temperature and heating rate) processes were simultaneously optimized using response surface methodology with the quadratic regression model associated with Box–Behnken design. By numerical optimization, the phosphate adsorption capacity of 245.06mg/g was achieved, corresponding to 99.9% of the predicted values under statistically optimized conditions (current density: 38.78mA/cm2, pyrolysis temperature: 584.1°C, heating rate: 6.91°C/min). By considering R2 and three error functions values, the experimental results of adsorption kinetics, and the equilibrium isotherms at different temperatures (10–30°C) showed that predictive pseudo-second-order and Sips isotherm models could adequately interpret the phosphate adsorption process for ‘statistically optimized electrically modified’-biochar (SOEM-biochar). The maximum phosphate adsorption capacities of SOEM-biochar were found to be 273.9, 345.1, and 460.3mg/g at 10, 20, and 30°C, respectively, which are higher than that of other adsorbents reported in the literature.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSaccharina japonica 3aadsorbents 3aadsorption 3aaluminum 3aheat 3amodels 3aphosphates 3apyrolysis 3aregression analysis 3aresponse surface methodology 3atemperature 0aElectro-modification 0aBiochar 0aPhosphate 0aResponse surface methodology 0aKinetics 0aEquilibrium isotherms1 aJeong, Tae-Un1 aKang, Ho-Jeong1 aChang, Jae-Soo1 aAhn, Kyu-Hong0 tBioresource technology.g2016 Aug., v. 214 p.548-557dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46263x0960-85247nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2016.05.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01817naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001500147245007800162300001800240520084400258592002801102650001501130650001301145650001801158650001801176650001101194650001001205700001601215700002401231700002201255773012301277856008201400852000901482655001201491IND60627420820221117021802.0220430e200809  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062742082DNAL7 a10.1007/s10853-008-2925-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNtenga, R.10aEstimation of the elastic anisotropy of sisal fibres by an inverse method  ap. 6206-6213.  aThis paper is concerned with an inverse method for the characterization of the elastic anisotropy of plant fibres. A good knowledge of the properties of composites reinforced with these fibres is essential for the safe design of the related structures. In this work, experimentation and analytical modelling were thoroughly combined to optimize the determination of plant fibre properties from their related composites. The experimental work focused on the manufacture and characterization of unidirectional (UD) sisal/epoxy composites. Tensile tests were performed to measure the axial and off-axes stiffness of these composites. Tests' data were eventualy used in an optimization process based on a micromechanical model to estimate the fibres’ elastic constants. Sisal fibres used herein exhibited a high degree of elastic anisotropy.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanisotropy 3aepoxides 3afiber quality 3amanufacturing 3amodels 3asisal1 aBéakou, A.1 aAtangana Atéba, J.1 aAyina Ohandja, L.0 tJournal of materials science.g2008 Sept., v. 43, no. 18 p.6206-6213dSpringer USwJournal:jnl4392857x0022-24617nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10853-008-2925-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02599naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094024002200130024001900152040001800171100001900189245006900208300001600277520107100293592002801364650001201392650001601404650001501420650000901435650002701444650001501471650001201486650001301498650002601511650002801537650001801565650001501583650002901598650002601627700002301653700002601676700002201702700002401724700002601748700002201774700002301796700002501819700002101844773009001865856008201955990002302037852000902060655001202069IND60092823620221121005111.0141103e20121003xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009282362DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cmet.2012.09.0072doi7 aPMC37741402pmcid7 a230400732pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPaek, Jennifer10aMitochondrial SKN-1/Nrf Mediates a Conserved Starvation Response  ap. 526-537.  aSKN-1/Nrf plays multiple essential roles in development and cellular homeostasis. We demonstrate that SKN-1 executes a specific and appropriate transcriptional response to changes in available nutrients, leading to metabolic adaptation. We isolated gain-of-function (gf) alleles of skn-1, affecting a domain of SKN-1 that binds the transcription factor MXL-3 and the mitochondrial outer membrane protein PGAM-5. These skn-1(gf) mutants perceive a state of starvation even in the presence of plentiful food. The aberrant monitoring of cellular nutritional status leads to an altered survival response in which skn-1(gf) mutants transcriptionally activate genes associated with metabolism, adaptation to starvation, aging, and survival. The triggered starvation response is conserved in mice with constitutively activated Nrf and may contribute to the tumorgenicity associated with activating Nrf mutations in mammalian somatic cells. Our findings delineate an evolutionarily conserved metabolic axis of SKN-1/Nrf, further establishing the complexity of this pathway.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalleles 3ahomeostasis 3ametabolism 3amice 3amitochondrial membrane 3amonitoring 3amutants 3amutation 3anutrient availability 3aouter membrane proteins 3asomatic cells 3astarvation 3atranscription (genetics) 3atranscription factors1 aLo, Jacqueline Y.1 aNarasimhan, Sri Devi1 aNguyen, Tammy N.1 aGlover-Cutter, Kira1 aRobida-Stubbs, Stacey1 aYohaku, Yorozuya,1 aYamamoto, Masayuki1 aBlackwell, T. Keith1 aCurran, Sean P.,0 tCell metabolism.g2012 Oct. 3, v. 16, no. 4 p.526-537dElsevier Inc.x1550-41317nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cmet.2012.09.0073Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03213naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002300147245010900170300002000279520171700299592002802016650004302044650002502087650001702112650002102129650001302150650001602163650001602179650001902195650002002214650002302234650001802257650002402275650001102299650001502310650001902325650001202344650001402356650002502370650001602395650001302411650001402424700002102438700002002459773015002479856008102629852000902710655001202719IND60440193720221119035420.0151024e201509  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6044019372DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-015-4658-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKhan, Tanveer Alam10aLycopersicon esculentum under low temperature stress: an approach toward enhanced antioxidants and yield  ap. 14178-14188.  aBrassinosteroids (BRs) have been implicated to overcome various abiotic stresses, and low temperature stress poses a serious threat to productivity of various horticultural crops like tomato. Therefore, a study was conducted to unravel the possible role of BRs in conferring alleviation to low temperature stress in Lycopersicon esculentum. Twenty-day-old seedlings of tomato var. S-22 (chilling tolerant) and PKM-1 (chilling sensitive) were sown in earthen pots, and at 40 days stage of growth, plants were exposed to varied levels of low temperatures (10/3, 12/7, 20/14, or 25/18 °C) for 24 h in a growth chamber. At 50 days stage of growth, the foliage of plants were sprayed with 0 or 10⁻⁸ M of BRs (28-homobrassinolide or 24-epibrassinolide), and 60-day-old plants were harvested to assess various physiological and biochemical parameters. Low temperatures induced a significant reduction in growth traits, chlorophyll content, and rate of photosynthesis in both the varieties differentially. Activities of antioxidant enzymes (catalase, peroxidase, and superoxide dismutase) and leaf proline content also increased substantially in both the varieties with decreasing temperature. On the other hand, treatment of BRs under stress and stress-free conditions significantly increased the aforesaid growth traits and biochemical parameters. Moreover, BRs further accelerated the antioxidative enzymes and proline content, which were already enhanced by the low temperature stress. Out of the two analogues of BRs tested, 24-epibrassinolide (EBL) was found more effective for both the varieties of tomato. EBL was found more potent stress alleviator against low temperature in both varieties of tomato.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSolanum lycopersicum var. lycopersicum 3aantioxidant activity 3aantioxidants 3abrassinosteroids 3acatalase 3achlorophyll 3acold stress 3acold treatment 3agrowth chambers 3agrowth retardation 3agrowth traits 3ahorticultural crops 3aleaves 3aperoxidase 3aphotosynthesis 3aproline 3aseedlings 3asuperoxide dismutase 3atemperature 3atomatoes 3avarieties1 aFariduddin, Qazi1 aYusuf, Mohammad0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research international.g2015 Sept., v. 22, no. 18 p.14178-14188dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx0944-13447nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-015-4658-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01749naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001600140245013000156300001800286520058400304592002800888650001500916650002300931650002700954650001300981650001900994650001301013650001601026650001701042650001101059650001401070700001601084700001501100700001301115700001801128773013401146856007401280852000901354655001201363IND60660189820221120033755.0190823e20140626xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066018982DNAL7 a10.1039/c4cc01862a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPark, Y.

With the aim of rivers water abstraction (RWA) estimating for agricultural uses, the current research was implemented, in Hashtgerd and Zarand-Saveh sub-catchments of Iran; classified in Csa and Bsk-Csa climate categories with water scarcity situation. The RWA variables were estimated based on morphological, hydrological, and land-use characteristics and their combinations. Estimation of RWA was operated by applying single and integrated-wavelet (integrated-W with noise reduction) soft-computing methods, including Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), Wavelet-ANN (WANNs), Adaptive Neural Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS), Wavelet-ANFIS (WANFIS), Gene Expression Programming (GEP), and Wavelet-GEP (WGEP). The WGEP model's efficiency with the hybrid characteristics of river width (RW), river depth (RD), minimum flow rate (QMᵢₙ), maximum flow rate (QMₐₓ), average flow rate (QMₑₐₙ), cultivated area (CA), and orchard area (OA) variables, was recommended as the best model to estimate RWA variables without climate conditions' effects. The obtained values of RMSE for hybrid characteristic of WGEP models were 26.310 and 61.256 (*10³ m³), for estimating RWA in Hashtgerd and Zarand-Saveh, respectively. The efficiencies of WGEP were excellent (R > 0.900) in the estimation of RWA in both climatic classes for maximum extreme values. Extracting mathematical formulation as part of the study’s result profoundly impacts implementing policies related to integrated water resources management (IWRM). Also, the modeling of the variables affected the optimal rate of agricultural RWA for advance measures of balancing policies improvement in supply and demand of water resources in the agricultural sector, modification of cultivation patterns to save water consumption, providing food security to communities, and reforming the pattern of riverbeds that are recommended for reaching the goals of IWRM.  aPublisher supplied data  a02-1399-26cSari Agricultural Science And Natural Resources University 3aagricultural industry 3afood security 3afuzzy logic 3agene expression 3ahybrids 3aland use 3aorchards 3ariver water 3arivers 3asupply balance 3awater management 3awater shortages 3aIran1 aSobhani, Reza1 aAḥmadī, Ḥusayn,1 aBoroomandnia, Arezoo1 aZamanzad-Ghavidel, Sarvin1 aAzamathulla, Hazi Mohammad0 tEnvironment, development and sustainability.g2022 Apr., v. 24, no. 4 p.4845-4871dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl3870050x1387-585X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10668-021-01637-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02698naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004400094040001800138100001400156245013600170300001800306520141300324592002801737650002601765650002101791650002301812650001301835650001901848650002101867650001901888650002301907650001101930650001401941650001501955700001801970700001401988700001702002700001302019700001602032700001502048700001602063773008602079856009002165852000902255655001202264IND60090392920221119054543.0141102e201202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009039292DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biomaterials.2011.10.0562doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Lei14aThe enhancement of cancer stem cell properties of MCF-7 cells in 3D collagen scaffolds for modeling of cancer and anti-cancer drugs  ap. 1437-1444.  aThree-dimensional (3D) culture could partially simulate in vivo conditions. In this work, we developed a 3D collagen scaffold to investigate cellular properties of MCF-7 cells. The porous scaffolds not only induced the diversification of cell morphologies but also extended cell proliferation. The expression of pro-angiogenic growth factors and the transcriptions of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) were significantly increased in cells cultured in 3D collagen scaffolds. In addition, 3D collagen scaffolds could generate a cell population with the properties of cancer stem cells (CSCs). The upregulation of EMT markers and the downregulation of the epithelial cell marker were observed in cells cultured in collagen scaffolds. The expression of stem cell markers, including OCT4A and SOX2, and breast cancer stem cell signatures, including SOX4, JAG1 and CD49F, was significantly unregulated in 3D collagen scaffolds. The proportion of cells with CSC-like CD44⁺/CD24⁻/ˡᵒʷ phenotype was notably increased. High-level expression of CSC-associated properties of MCF-7 cells cultured in 3D was further confirmed by high tumorigenicity in vivo. Moreover, xenografts with 3D cells formed larger tumors. The properties of MCF-7 cells in 3D may have partially simulated their in vivo behaviors. Thus, 3D collagen scaffolds might provide a useful platform for anti-cancer therapeutics and CSC research.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantineoplastic agents 3abreast neoplasms 3acell proliferation 3acollagen 3acultured cells 3aepithelial cells 3agrowth factors 3ametalloproteinases 3amodels 3aphenotype 3astem cells1 aXiao, Zhifeng1 aMeng, Yue1 aZhao, Yannan1 aHan, Jin1 aSu, Guannan1 aChen, Bing1 aDai, Jianwu0 tBiomaterials.g2012 Feb., v. 33, no. 5 p.1437-1444dElsevier Ltdx0142-96127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biomaterials.2011.10.0563Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03257naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100001500112245011300127300001600240506002800256520192600284592002802210506003702238650002102275650002502296650001202321650002002333650001102353650002602364650002202390650002102412650001502433650001702448650001402465650001602479650002502495650003702520650001002557653001402567653002302581653001302604700003002617700001402647773012902661852000902790655001202799IND60739575220221207121458.0210420e201906  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073957522DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVahedi, R.14aThe Effect of Fruit Trees Pruning Waste Biochar on some Soil Biological Properties under Rhizobox Conditions  ap. 321-336.  aResource is Open Access  aThe pyrolysis of fruit trees Pruning waste to be converted to biochar with microbial inoculation is a strategy improving the biological properties in calcareous soils. In order to investigate the biochar effect on some soil biological properties of the soil in the presence of microorganisms, a factorial experiment was carried out in a completely randomized design in the rhizobox under greenhouse condition. The factors included organic matter (pruning waste biochar and control), microbial inoculation (arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi and plant growth promoting rhizobacteria) and soil (rhizosphere and non-rhizosphere). After the end of the wheat plant growth period, microbial respiration (BR), Substrate-induced respiration (SIR), microbial biomass carbon (MBC), microbial biomass phosphorus (MBP), acid phosphatase (ACP) and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) enzymes in the rhizosphere soil and non-rhizosphere soil were determined. The results showed that the biochar and microbial inoculation application increased BR, SIR, MBC, MBP and ALP and decreased ACP, as compared to the control. So, the highest increase in the value of BR, SIR and MBC was related to mycorrhizal inoculation with biochar. An increase of 2.67 fold of ACP activity was observed in the treatment of bacterial inoculation with Biochar, as compared to the control treatment. Also, pruning waste biochar increased the amounts of MBC, MBP and ALP by 45.62%, 56.22% and 62.6% in the rhizosphere soil rather than non-rhizosphere soil, respectively. Microbial inoculation led to the increase of 1.31 and 1.41 folds by MBP and ACP in the rhizosphere soil, as compared with non-rhizosphere soil. Bacterial inoculation in the rhizosphere soil increased the ACP enzyme activity (28.31%), as compared with non-rhizosphere soil. It could be concluded that application of biochar in the conditions of microbial inoculation improved the soil biological properties.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aacid phosphatase 3aalkaline phosphatase 3abiochar 3aenzyme activity 3afruits 3agreenhouse production 3amicrobial biomass 3amicrobial carbon 3aphosphorus 3aplant growth 3apyrolysis 3arhizosphere 3arhizosphere bacteria 3avesicular arbuscular mycorrhizae 3awheat 0apyrolysis 0amicrobial activity 0arhizobox1 aSadaghiani, M.

Simultaneous consideration of scheduling the production and distribution and assigning delivery times could lead to reduced costs and, thus, more profit. Fuel costs constitute a significant portion of total transportation costs; therefore, reducing fuel consumption could improve transportation efficiency at the operational level. Sustained reduction of fuel consumption, in turn, mitigates greenhouse gas emissions. Consequently, reduction of fuel consumption is an important element of green vehicle routing problems. The authors consider the following as the main contributions of this paper: the main problem discussed through this study is the integrated scheduling of the SC, assignment of delivery times, scheduling of orders using a manufacturing system comprising one machine, delivery in batches, heterogeneous multi-vehicle job assignment based on loading capacity, all aiming at the minimization of distribution costs, fixed fuel costs, variable fuel costs, carbon emissions, and the time it takes to deliver the shipments. We present a mathematical model based on MINLP (mixed-integer nonlinear programming) for the problem. To validate this model, an ε-constraint technique is utilized and then compared with the MOACO (multi-objective ant colony optimization) algorithm at small scale. Finally, the algorithm is evaluated by comparing it with numerical examples generated by NSGA-II and several performance metrics are employed to assess the solutions of this MOP (multi-objective problem).  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3acarbon 3aenergy use and consumption 3aenvironment 3agreenhouse gases 3amathematical models 3asupply chain 3asupply chain management 3asystem optimization 3atransportation1 aRabet, Rahmat1 aSajadi, Seyed Mojtaba0 tEnvironment, development and sustainability.g2022 Apr., v. 24, no. 4 p.4566-4601dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl3870050x1387-585X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10668-021-01620-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01311naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094024002200130024001900152040001800171100002000189245004200209300001600251520032200267592002800589650001400617650001600631650002800647650000900675650001900684650001200703650001700715700002500732773009000757856008200847990002300929852000900952655001200961IND60092823820221121005235.0141103e20121003xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009282382DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cmet.2012.09.0092doi7 aPMC34949892pmcid7 a230400642pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiou, Alice P.10aAntibiotic Exposure Promotes Fat Gain  ap. 408-410.  aRecent research suggests that obesity may be influenced not only by dietary and genetic risk factors, but also by the trillions of microorganisms inhabiting our gastrointestinal tract.

By tracing the intracellular amino-acid profiles of HeLa cells treated with non-conditioned and three conditioned media (Taxol, L-alanine, and Taxol + L-alanine), it was observed that an alteration of amino-acid metabolism participates in Taxol-induced death of HeLa cells. The contents of 18 out of 21 detected amino-acids are 5–95% and the ones of lysine and methionine are 158 and 117% of the corresponding contents in the control after treatment with Taxol for 24 h, respectively. Addition of L-alanine inhibited cell apoptosis upon Taxol treatment by partially blocking the increase of lysine and methionine and reversing decrease trend of alanine, glycine, and glutamic acid. These results suggest that interference of amino-acid metabolism might be an important mechanism of Taxol cytotoxicity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalanine 3aamino acid composition 3aamino acid metabolism 3aanticarcinogenic activity 3aapoptosis 3acarcinoma 3acytotoxicity 3aglutamic acid 3alysine 3amethionine 3apaclitaxel 3auterine cervical neoplasms 2aAmino Acidsxanalysis 2aAntineoplastic Agentsxmetabolism 2aCell Death 2aCell Survivalxdrug effects 2aCulture Mediaxchemistry 2aCulture Media, Conditionedxchemistry 2aEpithelial Cellsxchemistryxdrug effects. 2aHeLa Cells 2aHumans 2aPaclitaxelxmetabolism1 aLiu, Yan-Qiu1 aWang, Long-Xing1 aYang, Qian-Xu1 aXiao, Hong-Bin0 tBiotechnology letters.g2012 Jan., v. 34, no. 1 p.1-7dSpringer-Verlagx0141-54927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10529-011-0730-5  aDNAL 7aarticle02131naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100005600146245012000202300002000322520097300342592002801315650001201343650001001355650001101365650001901376650002501395700001601420700006001436700005801496773017401554856008001728852000901808655001201817IND60671572120221119032429.0191003e20190916xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067157212DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.iecr.9b039982doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHopp, Madlen1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3613-858110aThermal Conductivity via Entropy Scaling: An Approach That Captures the Effect of Intramolecular Degrees of Freedom  ap. 18432-18438.  aThe thermal conductivity of gases depends strongly on the vibrational and rotational degrees of freedom of the molecule under consideration. Entropy scaling is based on the residual entropy, which does not capture the intramolecular and rotational contributions. This study proposes a model for the thermal conductivity that accounts for these degrees of freedom. We use the Chapman–Cowling approximation, where contributions of internal degrees of freedom to the thermal conductivity of an ideal gas are related to the self-diffusion coefficient. A resulting expression for the thermal conductivity is used as a reference in entropy scaling. We find experimental values for thermal conductivities in the entire fluid range to be (to good approximation) a function of residual entropy only. This study shows that entropy scaling is a strong approximation also for thermal conductivity, provided a suitable expression is chosen for the reference thermal conductivity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aentropy 3agases 3amodels 3aprocess design 3athermal conductivity1 aMele, Julia1 aHellmann, Robert1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3121-68271 aGross, Joachim1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8632-357X0 tIndustrial & engineering chemistry process design and development.g2019 Sept. 16, v. 58, no. 39 p.18432-18438dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23342x1520-50457nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.iecr.9b039983Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03800naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100005300150245006400203300002000267500001900287520235100306592002802657650001402685650002502699650002302724650002202747650001502769650002602784650001502810700002202825700001602847700001902863700001802882700002402900700001702924700001902941700006002960700001603020700002003036700002003056700001503076700001503091773013103106856008403237852000903321655001203330IND60719258620210421000000.0201201e20201110xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071925862DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.analchem.0c037532doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhou, Zhe1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0869-211210aPolyolefin Analyses with a 10 mm Multinuclear NMR Cryoprobe  ap. 15596-15603.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aPolyolefins are important and broadly used materials. Their molecular microstructures have direct impact on macroscopic properties and dictate end-use applications. ¹³C NMR is a powerful analytical technique used to characterize polyolefin microstructures, such as long-chain branching (LCB), but it suffers from low sensitivity. Although the ¹³C sensitivity of polyolefin samples can be increased by about 5.5 times with a cryoprobe, when compared with a conventional broadband observe (BBO) probe, further sensitivity enhancement is in high demand for studying increasingly complex polyolefin microstructures. Toward this goal, distortionless enhancement by polarization transfer (DEPT) and refocused insensitive nuclei enhanced by polarization transfer (RINEPT) are explored. The use of hard, regular, and new short adiabatic 180° ¹³C pulses in DEPT and RINEPT is investigated. It is found that RINEPTs perform better than DEPTs and a sensitivity enhancement of 3.1 can be achieved with RINEPTs. The results of RINEPTs are further analyzed with statistics software JMP and recommendations for optimal usage of RINEPTs are suggested. An example of analyzing saturated chain ends in an ethylene–octene copolymer sample with a hard 180° ¹³C RINEPT pulse is demonstrated. It is shown that the experimental time can be further reduced in half because of faster proton relaxation, where the total experimental time is about 580 times shorter when compared to using a conventional method and a 10 mm BBO probe. A naturally abundant nitrogen-containing polyolefin is analyzed using ¹H–¹⁵N HMBC and, to our knowledge, is the first ¹H–¹⁵N HMBC presented in the field of polyolefin characterization. The relative amount of similar nitrogen-containing structures is quantified by two-dimensional integration of ¹H–¹⁵N HMBC. Two pragmatic technical challenges related to using high-sensitivity NMR cryoprobes are also addressed: (1) A new ¹H decoupling sequence Bi_Waltz_65_256pl is proposed to address decoupling artifacts in ¹³C{¹H} NMR spectra which contain a strong ¹³C signal with a high signal-to-noise ratio (S/N). (2) A simple pulse sequence that affords zero-slope spectral baselines and quantitative results is presented to address acoustic ringing that is often associated with high-sensitivity cryoprobe use.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacoustics 3aanalytical chemistry 3acomposite polymers 3acomputer software 3apolyolefin 3asignal-to-noise ratio 3astatistics1 aKuemmerle, Rainer1 aRau, Nathan1 aEldred, Donald1 aMoreno, Aitor1 aCzarniecki, Barbara1 aQiu, Xiaohua1 aCong, Rongjuan1 aGies, Anthony P.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3558-593X1 aFan, Leslie1 aAuyeung, Evelyn1 aBeezer, Dain B.1 aDau, Huong1 aHarth, Eva0 tAnalytical chemistry.g2020 Nov. 10, v. 92, no. 23 p.15596-15603dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:jnl70375x1520-68827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.analchem.0c037533Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02456naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002100150245007700171300001600248520145400264592002801718650002501746650002001771650002401791650001201815650002601827650002201853650000901875650001301884650001201897700002001909773009601929856008402025852000902109655001202118IND60113084020221123031923.0141111e20130621xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011308402DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chroma.2013.03.0752doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAbernethy, Grant10aLactose semicarbazone as a marker for semicarbazide adulteration in milk  ap. 152-155.  aA liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry method to detect semicarbazide and lactose semicarbazone in milk was developed as part of a programme to set up methods for detecting the economically motivated adulteration of raw milk with nitrogen-containing compounds. The detection of semicarbazide was hampered by that fact that this compound tended to give broad, poor intensity peaks in the hydrophobic interaction chromatographic method employed. When spiked into milk at levels of 20–200ppm, semicarbazide either partially or completely reacted with the matrix, which both increased the limit of detection of the method and made the setting of a threshold by using low level spikes almost impossible. Thus using lactose semicarbazone as a marker for semicarbazide addition to milk was investigated. Lactose semicarbazone was detected in semicarbazide-spiked milk, and its identity was confirmed by fragmentation analysis and comparison with the synthesised compound. The level of lactose semicarbazone correlated with the amount of semicarbazide added to the milk, and the acidic conditions employed in the extraction method appeared to enhance the sensitivity of detection by driving the semicarbazone-forming reaction towards completion. Thus lactose semicarbazone can be used as a marker for the addition of semicarbazide to milk; however, both compounds should be monitored during surveys looking for the semicarbazide adulteration of milk.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadulterated products 3adetection limit 3ahydrophobic bonding 3alactose 3aliquid chromatography 3amass spectrometry 3amilk 3araw milk 3asurveys1 aHiggs, Kerianne0 tJournal of chromatography.g2013 June 21, v. 1295 p.152-155dElsevier B.V.x0021-96737nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chroma.2013.03.0753Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03644naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001300148245011400161300001100275520195500286592002802241596010602269650002302375650001302398650002402411650001502435650001202450650001102462650001602473650002102489650002802510650001802538650001102556650001502567650001702582650001802599650001202617650001802629650001702647650001802664700005702682700002202739700001402761700002102775700002202796700001502818700001902833700003102852773012702883856008303010852000903093655001203102IND60761368920221120230645.0220312e202201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076136892DNAL7 a10.1007/s00203-021-02697-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRaju, P.10aImpact of polystyrene microplastics on major marine primary (phytoplankton) and secondary producers (copepod)  ap. 84.  aThe effect of microplastic adsorption on marine microalgae Tetraselmis suecica, Amphora subtropica, and copepod Pseudodiaptomus annandalei was investigated in the present study. Fluorescence microscopic images were used to evaluate MP interactions with algae and copepods. T. suecica growth rate decreased with effects of 0.1 µm polystyrene exposure to 75 µl/100 ml (0.899 to 0.601 abs), 50 µl/100 ml (0.996 to 0.632 abs) and 25 µl/100 ml (0.996 to 0.632 abs), respectively. On the other hand, at 10th day of experiment, the control T. suecica showed the highest growth rate (0.965 abs), chlorophyll concentration (Chl-‘a' = 21.36 µg/L; Chl-‘b' = 13.65 µg/L), and cell density (3.3 × 10⁶ cells/ml). A marine diatom A. subtropica absorbed 2.0 μm microplastics, and the maximal inhibition rate increased at higher MP concentration until 10th day. The highest MPs (75 μl/100 ml) treatment resulted in decreased growth rate of A. subtropica from 0.163 to 0.096 abs. A. subtropica (without MPs) had the highest lipid concentration of 27.15%, whereas T. suecica had the lowest lipid concentration of 11.2% (without MP). The maximum survival (80%) of P. annandalei was found in control on 15th day whereas on 12th day, the microplastics ingested copepod had the lowest survival rate (0%). On 15th day, the maximum Nauplii Production Rate (NPR) (19.33) female⁻¹ was observed in control, whereas the minimum (17.33) female⁻¹ NPR was observed in copepod ingested with MPs. The maximum lipid production (17.33% without MPs) was reported in control, whereas MPs fed copepods had the lowest lipid production (16%). Long-term exposure to polystyrene microplastics significantly reduced algae growth and chlorophyll concentration and also NPR and lipid concentration rate of copepod. We inferred that microplastic exposure of algae and copepods might results in persistent decreases in ingested carbon biomass over time.  aPublisher supplied data  a(F.

Once generated, iPSCs are tested using a variety of assays including immunostaining for pluripotency markers, generation of three germ layers in embryoid bodies and teratomas, comparisons of gene expression with embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and production of chimeric mice with or without germline contribution2. Importantly, iPSC lines that pass these tests still vary in their capacity to produce different differentiated cell types2. This has made it difficult to establish which iPSC derivation protocols, donor cell sources or selection methods are most useful for different applications. The most stringent test of whether a stem cell line has sufficient developmental potential to generate all tissues required for survival of an organism (termed full pluripotency) is tetraploid embryo complementation (TEC)3-5. Technically, TEC involves electrofusion of two-cell embryos to generate tetraploid (4n) one-cell embryos that can be cultured in vitro to the blastocyst stage6. Diploid (2n) pluripotent stem cells (e.g. ESCs or iPSCs) are then injected into the blastocoel cavity of the tetraploid blastocyst and transferred to a recipient female for gestation (see Figure 1). The tetraploid component of the complemented embryo contributes almost exclusively to the extraembryonic tissues (placenta, yolk sac), whereas the diploid cells constitute the embryo proper, resulting in a fetus derived entirely from the injected stem cell line. Recently, we reported the derivation of iPSC lines that reproducibly generate adult mice via TEC1. These iPSC lines give rise to viable pups with efficiencies of 5-13%, which is comparable to ESCs3,4,7 and higher than that reported for most other iPSC lines8-12. These reports show that direct reprogramming can produce fully pluripotent iPSCs that match ESCs in their developmental potential and efficiency of generating pups in TEC tests. At present, it is not clear what distinguishes between fully pluripotent iPSCs and less potent lines13-15. Nor is it clear which reprogramming methods will produce these lines with the highest efficiency. Here we describe one method that produces fully pluripotent iPSCs and "all- iPSC" mice, which may be helpful for investigators wishing to compare the pluripotency of iPSC lines or establish the equivalence of different reprogramming methods.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadults 3ablastocyst 3acell lines 3adiploidy 3aelectrofusion 3aembryonic germ layers 3aembryonic stem cells 3afemales 3afetus 3agerm cells 3ainduced pluripotent stem cells 3amice 3aplacenta 3apregnancy 3apups 3aselection methods 3asomatic cells 3atetraploidy 3atissues 3ayolk sac1 aHazen, Jennifer L.1 aNazor, Kristopher L.1 aRodriguez, Alberto R.1 aMartin, Greg1 aKupriyanov, Sergey1 aBaldwin, Kristin K.0 tJournal of visualized experiments.g2012 Nov. 29, , no. 69 p.e4003-e4003dJournal of Visualized ExperimentswJournal:jnl4469330x1940-087X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3791/40033Available from publisher's site  uhttp://www.jove.com/video/4003/generation-of-mice-derived-from-induced-pluripotent-stem-cells  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02488naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100005700150245008200207300002000289500001900309520110700328592002801435650001601463650003401479650001101513650002401524650001601548650003001564650000901594650002501603650001201628650001801640700002201658700001801680700002401698700006901722700006301791773013101854856008401985852000902069655001202078IND60719258820210421000000.0201201e20201118xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071925882DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.analchem.0c038452doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJonas, Adrian1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1511-561210aTransient Sub-nanosecond Soft X-ray NEXAFS Spectroscopy on Organic Thin Films  ap. 15611-15615.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aWe demonstrate visible pump soft X-ray probe near-edge X-ray absorption fine structure (NEXAFS) spectroscopy measurements at the carbon K edge on thin molecular films in the laboratory. This opens new opportunities through the use of laboratory equipment for chemical speciation. We investigate the metal-free porphyrin derivative tetra(tert-butyl)porphyrazine as an ideal model system to elucidate electronic properties of tetrapyrroles like chlorophyll or heme. In contrast to measurements in gas or liquid state, the investigation of thin films is of high interest in the field of optoelectronic and photovoltaic devices though challenging due to the low damage thresholds of the samples upon excitation. With a careful pre-characterization using optical techniques, successful measurements were performed using a NEXAFS spectrometer based on a laser-produced plasma source and reflection zone plates with a resolving power of 1000 and a time resolution of 0.5 ns. In combination with density functional theory calculations, first insights into a long-lived excitonic state are gained and discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-radiation 3aX-ray absorption spectroscopy 3acarbon 3achemical speciation 3achlorophyll 3adensity functional theory 3aheme 3alaboratory equipment 3aliquids 3aspectrometers1 aDammer, Katharina1 aStiel, Holger1 aKanngiesser, Birgit1 aSánchez-de-Armas, Rocío1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2384-48931 aMantouvalou, Ioanna1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9696-29700 tAnalytical chemistry.g2020 Nov. 18, v. 92, no. 23 p.15611-15615dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:jnl70375x1520-68827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.analchem.0c038453Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01844naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001700152245013600169300001400305520073600319592002801055650000901083650001401092650001801106650001101124650002001135650002801155650002401183700001701207700001901224700001801243773011501261856008601376990002301462852000901485655001201494IND60093750420221120193527.0141103e20130715xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009375042DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemolab.2013.04.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Guoqiang10aModel NOx emissions by least squares support vector machine with tuning based on ameliorated teaching–learning-based optimization  ap. 11-20.  aThe teaching–learning-based optimization (TLBO) is a new efficient optimization algorithm.

Compared with other several optimization methods, A-TLBO shows better search performance. In addition, the A-TLBO is adopted to adjust the hyper-parameters of least squares support vector machine (LS-SVM) in order to build NOx emissions model of a 330MW coal-fired boiler and obtain a well-generalized model.

More ESTs from cultivated peanuts are needed for isolation of stress-resistant, tissue-specific and developmentally important genes. Here, we generated 63,234 ESTs from our 5 constructed peanut cDNA libraries of Ralstonia solanacearum challenged roots, R. solanacearum challenged leaves, and unchallenged cultured peanut roots, leaves and developing seeds. Among these ESTs, there were 14,547 unique sequences with 7,961 tentative consensus sequences and 6,586 singletons. Putative functions for 47.8 % of the sequences were identified, including transcription factors, tissue-specific genes, genes involved in fatty acid biosynthesis and oil formation regulation, and resistance gene analogue genes. Additionally, differentially expressed genes, including those involved in ethylene and jasmonic acid signal transduction pathways, from both peanut leaves and roots, were identified in R. solanacearum challenged samples. This large expression dataset from different peanut tissues will be a valuable source for marker development and gene expression analysis. It will also be helpful for finding candidate genes for fatty acid synthesis and oil formation regulation as well as for studying mechanisms of interactions between the peanut host and R. solanacearum pathogen.  aPublisher supplied data 3aethylene 3afatty acids 3apeanuts 3asignal transduction 3aoil crops 3aRalstonia solanacearum 3aroots 3ajasmonic acid 3adata collection 3agene expression 3aArachis hypogaea 3apathogens 3aleaves 3atranscription factors 3aseeds 3acomplementary DNA 3aoils 3acDNA libraries 3abiosynthesis 3aconsensus sequence 3aexpressed sequence tags 3aseed development 2aArachisxgeneticsxgrowth & developmentximmunologyxmicrobiology. 2aConsensus Sequence 2aCrops, Agriculturalxgeneticsxgrowth & developmentximmunologyxmicrobiology. 2aCyclopentanesxmetabolism 2aDisease Resistance 2aEthylenesxmetabolism 2aExpressed Sequence Tags 2aFatty Acidsxbiosynthesisxgenetics. 2aGene Expression Regulation, Plant 2aGene Library 2aGenes, Plant 2aGenes, Regulator 2aOxylipinsxmetabolism 2aPlant Diseasesximmunologyxmicrobiology. 2aPlant Leavesxgeneticsximmunologyxmicrobiology. 2aPlant Oilsxmetabolism 2aPlant Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aPlant Rootsxgeneticsximmunologyxmicrobiology. 2aRalstonia solanacearumximmunologyxpathogenicity. 2aSeedsxgeneticsxgrowth & developmentximmunology. 2aSignal Transduction 2aTranscription Factorsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 0agenes1 aYan, Liying1 aLei, Yong1 aJiang, Huifang1 aRen, Xiaoping1 aLiao, Boshou0 tJournal of plant research.g2012 Nov., v. 125, no. 6 p.755-769dSpringer-Verlagx0918-94407nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10265-012-0491-9  aDNAL 7aarticle03043naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245009300167300001600260520199400276592002802270650001902298650002302317650001502340650002602355650002202381650001602403650001702419650002002436700003402456700002602490773009602516856008402612852000902696655001202705IND60113084220221123004611.0141111e20130628xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011308422DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chroma.2013.03.0722doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBruheim, Per10aStable isotope coded derivatizing reagents as internal standards in metabolite profiling  ap. 196-203.  aGas chromatography (GC) and liquid chromatography (LC) coupled to mass spectrometric (MS) detection have become the two main techniques for the analysis of metabolite pools (i.e. Metabolomics). These technologies are especially suited for Metabolite Profiling analysis of various metabolite groups due to high separation capabilities of the chromatographs and high sensitivity of the mass analysers. The trend in quantitative Metabolite Profiling is to add more metabolites and metabolite groups in a single method. This should not be done by compromising the analytical precision. Mass spectrometric detection comes with certain limitations, especially in the quantitative aspects as standards are needed for conversion of ion abundance to concentration and ionization efficiencies are directly dependent on eluent conditions. This calls for novel strategies to counteract all variables that can influence the quantitative precision. Usually, internal standards are used to correct any technical variation. For quantitation of single or just a few analytes this can be executed with spiking isotopically labeled standards. However, for more comprehensive analytical tasks, e.g. profiling tens or hundreds of analytes simultaneously, this strategy becomes expensive and in many cases isotopically labeled standards are not available. An alternative is to introduce a derivatizing step where the sample is derivatized with naturally labeled reagent, while a standard solution is separately derivatized with isotopically labeled reagent and spiked into the sample solution prior to analysis. This strategy, named isotope coded derivatization – ICD, is attractive in the emerging field of quantitative Metabolite Profiling where current protocols can easily comprise over hundred metabolites. This review provides an overview of isotopically labeled derivatizing reagents that have been developed for important metabolite groups with the aim to improve analytical performance and precision.  aPublisher supplied data 3aderivatization 3agas chromatography 3aionization 3aliquid chromatography 3amass spectrometry 3ametabolites 3ametabolomics 3astable isotopes1 aKvitvang, Hans Fredrik Nyvold1 aVillas-Boas, Silas G.0 tJournal of chromatography.g2013 June 28, v. 1296 p.196-203dElsevier B.V.x0021-96737nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chroma.2013.03.0723Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02022naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245007400167300001800241520099100259592002801250650002201278650002401300650001801324650002101342650001801363650002601381650001501407650002201422700001901444700002101463773010501484856008601589852000901675655001201684IND60578308920221123003338.0170812e20170711xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057830892DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.macromol.7b007532doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLee, Sunglin10aCrystal Modulus of Poly(glycolic acid) and Its Temperature Dependence  ap. 5074-5079.  aElastic modulus of the crystalline regions (crystal modulus) of poly(glycolic acid) (PGA) in the directions parallel (Eₗ) and perpendicular (Eₜ) to the chain axis was measured by X-ray diffraction. The Eₗ value of PGA was 104 GPa at room temperature. This relatively low Eₗ value suggests that the PGA skeleton is not fully extended as reported before but contracted. The Eₜ value of PGA was obtained as 7 GPa, which resembles that (7 GPa) of poly(vinyl alcohol) based on intermolecular hydrogen bonds. This reveals strong intermolecular interactions act between PGA molecules in the crystal lattice. Both low Eₗ value and high Eₜ value are considered to contribute to the extraordinarily high melting point (223 °C) of PGA among aliphatic polyesters. Temperature dependence (13–400 K) of both Eₗ and Eₜ of PGA was also investigated. Abrupt changes around 200 K for both directions were considered to be caused by molecular motion in the crystalline regions of PGA.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3aambient temperature 3aglycolic acid 3ahydrogen bonding 3amelting point 3amodulus of elasticity 3apolyesters 3apolyvinyl alcohol1 aHongo, Chizuru1 aNishino, Takashi0 tMacromolecules.g2017 July 11, v. 50, no. 13 p.5074-5079dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-58357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.macromol.7b007533Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02467naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100005700150245011200207520130500319592002801624650001501652650001401667650002001681650003401701650002001735650002401755653001801779653000801797653000801805653000901813653002301822700005901845700001701904773009001921856008502011852000902096655001202105IND60786174820221117172236.0220929e20221115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078617482DNAL7 a10.1016/j.energy.2022.1248512doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Gengfeng1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1786-363310aState of health estimation of power batteries based on multi-feature fusion models using stacking algorithm  aThe data-driven method is used widely to estimate the state of health (SOH) of the battery, but the selection of data features and the data training methods affect the estimation results greatly. With the stacking algorithm, this paper proposes a multi-feature fusion model to estimate battery SOH by fusing different feature parameters and combining support vector regression (SVR) and long short-term memory network (LSTM). The feature parameters were extracted only from the current change curve of the constant voltage charging stage. The support vector regression based on grid search (GS-SVR) was selected as the primary-learner, and the primary SVR models were constructed through 5-fold cross-validation for different feature parameters. The LSTM was selected as the secondary-learner. With the stacking algorithm, LSTM was used to fuse multiple primary SVR models to form an ensemble learner model to improve the performance of multi-feature fusion. The battery aging test data set and NASA battery test data set were used to evaluate the effectiveness. The results verified the validity and superiority of the proposed method. Compared with the existing estimation methods, root mean square error is reduced by at least 0.11, and mean absolute percentage error is reduced by at least 0.12%.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3abatteries 3adata collection 3aelectric potential difference 3aneural networks 3aregression analysis 0aPower battery 0aSOH 0aSVR 0aLSTM 0aStacking algorithm1 aZhang, Xiangwen1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1786-36331 aLiu, Zhiming0 tEnergy.g2022 Nov. 15, v. 259 p.124851-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12436x0360-54427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2022.1248513Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03570naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100003000139245014300169300001800312520226600330592002802596650001402624650001502638650002102653650002002674650001502694650002202709650001402731650001202745650002202757650001902779650002002798650001002818650001202828700002002840700002202860700001802882700001602900700001802916773012002934856007303054852000903127655001203136IND60082165020221119063707.0141016e201411  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008216502DNAL7 a10.1111/jbi.123642doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOliver, P. M.q(Paul M.),10aContrasting patterns of persistence and diversification in vicars of a widespread Australian lizard lineage (the Oedura marmorata complex)  ap. 2068-2079.  aAIM: Lineages in many parts of the world have distributions that have been shaped by range contraction in the face of deteriorating climatic conditions through the Neogene. When such lineages now consist of widely spaced vicariant populations (vicars) they provide opportunities (1) to compare and contrast the timing and pattern of diversification within and between major geographical regions, and (2) to examine how differential interactions with geography, climate and localized adaptation may have shaped idiosyncratic patterns of genetic diversification. LOCATION: Australian Arid Zone (AAZ) and Australian Monsoonal Tropics (AMT). METHODS: We compiled and analysed mitochondrial DNA, nuclear DNA and allozyme datasets to determine the evolutionary history and genetic diversity of isolated populations of a gecko lineage (the Oedura marmorata complex and related taxa) distributed across the Australian monsoonal and arid biomes. RESULTS: Three widely allopatric lineages in the AAZ diverged during the late Miocene and Plio‐Pleistocene. Populations in the AMT display much greater genetic turnover than those in the AAZ over equivalent geographical distances, and also include several lineages that are of equal or greater age than all diversity in the AAZ. Saxicoline lineages tend to show higher genetic diversity and/or have more restricted ranges than arboreal relatives in both biomes. MAIN CONCLUSIONS: Lineages of Oedura show contrasting patterns of diversification in the two major biomes they inhabit. Diversity in the arid biome is younger and restricted to widely separated refugia, reflecting the younger age and pervasive harshness of this environment. Higher diversity in the AMT is also indicative of persistence, but at much finer geographical scales and broadly over a longer period of time, perhaps reflecting the more continuous spatial and temporal distribution of equitable habitats within this region. Finally, the wider distribution of arboreal lineages in both biomes suggests that ecological flexibility has also shaped the contrasting patterns of distribution in related lineages, and supports the contention that an association with rocks has shaped high lineage diversity in many taxa from the Australian Monsoonal Tropics.  aPublisher supplied data 3aallozymes 3aarid zones 3aclimatic factors 3adata collection 3aecosystems 3agenetic variation 3ageography 3alizards 3amitochondrial DNA 3anuclear genome 3arefuge habitats 3arocks 3atropics1 aSmith, Katie L.1 aLaver, Rebecca J.1 aDoughty, Paul1 aAdams, Mark1 aRiddle, Brett0 tJournal of biogeography.g2014 Nov., v. 41, no. 11 p.2068-2079dBlackwell Scientific Publications.x0305-02707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jbi.123643Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02777naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001800146245007400164300002000238520100500258592002801263650001301291650001601304650000901320650001801329650001601347650001801363650001601381650002201397650001301419650001301432650000901445650001401454650001601468650002001484650001401504650001001518650001401528650001701542653001501559653003801574653003301612653002601645700001401671700001801685700005801703700001501761700001701776700001601793700001401809700001501823700001701838700001401855700005401869773015101923856008002074852000902154655001202163IND60671572620200128000000.0191003e20190906xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067157262DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jafc.9b030992doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGao, Xiaoting10aEffect of Dielectric Barrier Discharge Cold Plasma on Pea Seed Growth  ap. 10813-10822.  aTraditional seed pretreatment methods cause secondary pollution for the application of various chemicals. This study investigated the effect of dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) cold plasma on seedling growth. Effects of plasma-activated tap water (PATW) and plasma-activated seeds (PAS) were compared for germination rates, seedling height, dry weight, and chlorophyll content. Results show that compared with controls these growth parameters were all increased by more than 50%. The yields and contributions of hydrogen peroxide, nitrate, nitrite, and ammonium were quantified. Hydrogen peroxide and nitrate have an important role in seedling growth. By etching, the seed epidermis free radicals can reduce the apparent contact angle and increase the water absorption of the seeds. In addition to the low cost of PATW and PAS compared with commercial fertilizers, DBD does not involve any chemical addition. Thus, both PATW and PAS can be an alternative for improvement of agricultural production.  aPublisher supplied data 3aammonium 3achlorophyll 3acold 3acontact angle 3afertilizers 3afree radicals 3agermination 3ahydrogen peroxide 3anitrates 3anitrites 3apeas 3apollution 3aseed growth 3aseedling growth 3aseedlings 3aseeds 3atap water 3awater uptake 0aDBD plasma 0aplasma-activated tap water (PATW) 0aplasma-activated seeds (PAS) 0aimprovement mechanism1 aZhang, Ai1 aHeroux, Paul,1 aSand, Wolfgang1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6724-09601 aSun, Zhuyu1 aZhan, Jiaxun1 aWang, Cihao1 aHao, Siyu1 aLi, Zhenyu1 aLi, Zhenying1 aGuo, Ying1 aLiu, Yanan1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2582-75010 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2019 Sept. 06, v. 67, no. 39 p.10813-10822dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:12177x1520-51187nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jafc.9b030993Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02012naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001500151245009400166300001800260520081900278592002801097650001501125650001701140650002401157650001501181650002201196650001301218651001001231653004901241653001701290653001601307700001401323700001301337700001401350700001501364700001101379700001801390773009901408856008601507852000901593655001201602IND60535072220221120202027.0190319e20150731xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053507222DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vaccine.2015.04.0602doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Dawei10aSurveillance of adverse events following immunization in China: Past, present, and future  ap. 4041-4046.  aSurveillance for adverse events following immunization (AEFI) is an important component of any national immunization program. In the People's Republic of China (China), a populous, middle-income country, development of an AEFI surveillance system began in 2005. In 2008, the AEFI surveillance system was implemented as a nationwide, online system and called the Chinese National AEFI Information System (CNAEFIS). Since then, CNAEFIS has provided useful, national-level data on vaccine safety. National AEFI surveillance guidelines were issued jointly by the Ministry of Health and the China Food and Drug Administration in 2010.

Many conservation strategies have therefore focused on the protection or restoration of grasslands considered the remnant fragments of nature in wetlands before agricultural development. Through the example of the largest French Atlantic wetland (the Marais Poitevin) and using high-resolution historical records documenting landscape changes since the beginning of the 18th century, we propose the first long-term analysis of a wetland conversion at a large spatial scale. We demonstrate that, although the last land cover changes corresponded to significant grassland to cropland conversions, the mid-20th century was characterized by an exceptional grassland cover (90% of the area). We also show that current surface areas covered by grasslands are similar to those of the 18th and 19th centuries, and that grassland to cropland conversion followed a massive decline in the most natural habitats of the wetland such as marshes, salt-marshes and other marine habitats. From a long-term perspective, grassland to cropland conversion is rather a recent change and grasslands can be viewed as the result of agricultural development in this wetland rather than pristine habitats. In contrast, marshes, salt-marshes and other marine habitats can be considered the remnant fragments of nature of conservation interest, although they are neglected in current conservation plans. We discuss the problem of the time-span and the reference state to be considered when analyzing land cover changes and assessing wetland conservation issues at large spatial scales.  aPublisher supplied data 3acropland 3ageography 3agrasslands 3ahabitats 3aland cover 3alandscapes 3asalt marshes 3awetland conservation 0aLand cover 0aMap 0aWetland 0aGrassland 0aConservation 0aMarais Poitevin1 aThomas, Alain0 tApplied geography.g2013 Aug., v. 42 p.133-139dElsevier LtdwJournal:11785x0143-62287nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apgeog.2013.05.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03691naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100005500144245013500199300001800334506010400352506007600456520184600532592002802378506003702406650002802443650001802471650002102489650002402510650002402534650002202558650002002580650001902600650001802619650000902637650001002646650002202656650002302678653003402701653001602735653001702751653002102768700005502789700005602844700005502900773015402955856007903109852000903188655001203197IND60767732720221207073608.0220326e202204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076773272DNAL7 a10.3168/jds.2021-210702doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWalsh, D.P.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3800-502110aEconomics of timed artificial insemination with unsorted or sexed semen in a high-producing, pasture-based dairy production system  ap. 3192-3208.  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThis study used a stochastic simulation model to estimate the potential economic benefit of using timed artificial insemination (TAI) in combination with conventional unsorted (TCONV) and sexed (TSEX) semen in heifers only (TCONV-H, TSEX-H) and in both heifers and lactating cows (TCONV-HC, TSEX-HC) in a high-producing, pasture-based production system. The scenarios were compared with a conventional reproductive policy (CONV) in which heifers and cows were inseminated with conventional unsorted semen after estrus detection. Sensitivity analysis was also used to estimate the effect of hormone costs from TAI use on the profitability of each program relative to CONV. The mean annual (± standard deviation) profit advantage (ΔPROF) over CONV for TCONV-H, TCONV-HC, TSEX-H, and TSEX-HC scenarios were €3.90/cow ± 4.65, €34.11/cow ± 25.69, €13.96/cow ± 6.83, and €41.52/cow ± 42.86, respectively. Combined application of both technologies was shown to return a greater annual ΔPROF on average compared with that achievable from TAI alone. However, the risk of not returning a positive annual ΔPROF varied across the scenarios with higher risk in TCONV-H and TSEX-HC. Specifically, TCONV-H and TSEX-HC had a 24 and 18% chance, respectively, of not returning a positive annual ΔPROF. Sensitivity analysis showed that when hormone costs increased by €10/cow TCONV-H and TSEX-HC had a 38 and 23% chance, respectively, of not returning a positive annual ΔPROF. The range in ΔPROF for TCONV policies was most sensitive to the TAI pregnancy rate and TSEX policies were most sensitive to the relative fertility achieved with sexed compared with unsorted semen. This study has shown TAI and sexed semen are complementary technologies that can increase genetic gain and profitability in a pasture-based, dairy production system.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aartificial insemination 3adairy science 3aestrus detection 3afinancial economics 3agenetic improvement 3aissues and policy 3amilk production 3apregnancy rate 3aprofitability 3arisk 3asemen 3asimulation models 3astandard deviation 0atimed artificial insemination 0asexed semen 0abioeconomics 0astochastic model1 aFahey, A.G.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4594-57671 aLonergan, P.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5598-50441 aWallace, M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3616-89190 tJournal of dairy science.g2022 Apr., v. 105, no. 4 p.3192-3208dElsevier Inc.aAmerican Dairy Science AssociationwJournal:jnl45500x0022-03027nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3168/jds.2021-210703Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04146naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002200094024002200116024001900138040001800157100002300175245012800198300001400326520258800340592002802928650004102956650001502997650002703012650002303039650001503062650001303077650001403090650002203104650001803126650002503144650001503169700001903184700001903203700002003222700001503242700002103257700001903278700002103297773014903318856006803467856009703535990002303632852000903655655001203664IND60643367320221119083403.0190510e20121209xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064336732DNAL7 a10.3791/40092doi7 aPMC35984092pmcid7 a232421322pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRabotyagov, Sergey10aSpatial multiobjective optimization of agricultural conservation practices using a swat model and an evolutionary algorithm  ap. e4009.  aFinding the cost-efficient (i.e., lowest-cost) ways of targeting conservation practice investments for the achievement of specific water quality goals across the landscape is of primary importance in watershed management. Traditional economics methods of finding the lowest-cost solution in the watershed context (e.g.,5,12,20) assume that off-site impacts can be accurately described as a proportion of on-site pollution generated. Such approaches are unlikely to be representative of the actual pollution process in a watershed, where the impacts of polluting sources are often determined by complex biophysical processes. The use of modern physically-based, spatially distributed hydrologic simulation models allows for a greater degree of realism in terms of process representation but requires a development of a simulation-optimization framework where the model becomes an integral part of optimization. Evolutionary algorithms appear to be a particularly useful optimization tool, able to deal with the combinatorial nature of a watershed simulation-optimization problem and allowing the use of the full water quality model. Evolutionary algorithms treat a particular spatial allocation of conservation practices in a watershed as a candidate solution and utilize sets (populations) of candidate solutions iteratively applying stochastic operators of selection, recombination, and mutation to find improvements with respect to the optimization objectives. The optimization objectives in this case are to minimize nonpoint-source pollution in the watershed, simultaneously minimizing the cost of conservation practices. A recent and expanding set of research is attempting to use similar methods and integrates water quality models with broadly defined evolutionary optimization methods3,4,9,10,13-15,17-19,22,23,25. In this application, we demonstrate a program which follows Rabotyagov et al.'s approach and integrates a modern and commonly used SWAT water quality model7 with a multiobjective evolutionary algorithm SPEA226, and user-specified set of conservation practices and their costs to search for the complete tradeoff frontiers between costs of conservation practices and user-specified water quality objectives. The frontiers quantify the tradeoffs faced by the watershed managers by presenting the full range of costs associated with various water quality improvement goals. The program allows for a selection of watershed configurations achieving specified water quality improvement goals and a production of maps of optimized placement of conservation practices.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSoil and Water Assessment Tool model 3aalgorithms 3aconservation practices 3acost effectiveness 3alandscapes 3amutation 3apollution 3asimulation models 3awater quality 3awatershed management 3awatersheds1 aCampbell, Todd1 aValcu, Adriana1 aGassman, Philip1 aJha, Manoj1 aSchilling, Keith1 aWolter, Calvin1 aKling, Catherine0 tJournal of visualized experiments.g2012 Dec. 09, , no. 70 p.e4009-e4009dJournal of Visualized ExperimentswJournal:jnl4469330x1940-087X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3791/40093Available from publisher's site  uhttp://www.jove.com/video/4009/spatial-multiobjective-optimization-agricultural-conservation  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02441naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001400150245009400164300002000258500001900278520134500297592002801642650002501670650002601695650002001721650001301741650001701754650001201771700001901783700002001802700005701822773013101879856008402010852000902094655001202103IND60719259320221118011433.0201201e20201110xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071925932DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.analchem.0c040172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Jin10a“Loading-type” Plasmonic Nanoparticles for Detection of Peroxynitrite in Living Cells  ap. 15647-15654.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aTo date, plasmon resonance energy transfer (PRET)-based analytical approaches still inevitably suffer from limitations, such as lack of appropriate acceptor–donor pairs and the extra requirements of active groups of acceptors, which place great obstacles in extending the application of such methods, especially in the area of living cell studies. Herein, we design and fabricate a kind of “loading-type” plasmonic nanomaterials constituting gold nanoparticles as donors of PRET coated with mesoporous silicon, in which organic small molecules (CHCN) as acceptors of PRET were loaded (Au@MSN-CHCN). This “loading-type” strategy could conveniently integrate acceptor–donor pairs into one nanoparticle, so as to achieve the goal of sensitive detection of biomolecules in a complex physiological microenvironment. Based on the change of PRET efficiency of Au@MSN-CHCN induced by the specific reaction between CHCN and peroxynitrite (ONOO–), ONOO–, which plays an irreplaceable role in a series of physiological and pathological processes, is sensitively and selectively detected. Furthermore, in situ imaging of exogenous and endogenous ONOO– in living cells was achieved even at a single nanoparticle level. This work provides a general approach to construct PRET probes for visualizing various biomolecules in living cells.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanalytical chemistry 3abiochemical compounds 3aenergy transfer 3ananogold 3aporous media 3asilicon1 aLi, Xiang-Ling1 aChen, Hong-Yuan1 aXu, Jing-Juan1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9579-93180 tAnalytical chemistry.g2020 Nov. 10, v. 92, no. 23 p.15647-15654dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:jnl70375x1520-68827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.analchem.0c040173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03940naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005900148245005800207300001000265520267000275592002802945650001402973650001102987650001302998650001703011650001403028650000903042650001703051650001103068650001203079650001403091650001503105650001403120650001303134650000903147650001203156650001603168650001703184650001303201651001103214700002603225773013903251856008303390852000903473655001203482IND60761369520221120220730.0220512e202202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076136952DNAL7 a10.1007/s10344-021-01543-w2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPakuła, Marcin1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4335-493910aBat behavior around double-track electrified railways  ap. 5.  aAnimals’ mortality due to transportation infrastructure is a significant problem for some species. Scale of mortality in part depends on their behavior near railways and other transport routes. We studied the mortality and flight activity of bats in 7 double-track electrified (i.e., leading the catenary, a railway overhead electric line) railway sites in Poland. We aimed to measure the likelihood that bats use areas which pose a potential risk of collision with trains. During acoustic (ultrasound detectors) and visual (thermal imaging cameras) observations, we identified bats’ positions near the railway (A — high above catenary; B — close (< 1 m) but not under catenary; C — the space destined for passing trains between tracks, traction poles, and the top of the catenary; D — at the side of the railway and next to vegetation without crossing the railway area; and E — under bridges) in different habitats (forest, water, open, urbanized). Bat activity was significantly lower (4%) in high-risk impact zone (C) than that in other zones (96%). However, bats were more prone to occur in high-risk impact zones in urbanized and open habitats, whereas, in water and forest habitats, bats occurred much less frequently. In forest sections of the railways, flights along the railway typically took place between the line and vegetation (zone D), or close to the catenary (zone B). We detected significant differences between species activity in and outside the high-impact zone (C) and other zones (A, B, D, E). Open-spaced and high-flying common noctule Nyctalus noctula usually flew or foraged above the railway area. Daubenton’s bat Myotis daubentonii almost exclusively sought food above lakes or rivers and under the railway bridges. In serotines Eptesicus and pipistrelles Pipistrellus group, there was a higher tendency to use a high-risk impact zone. The search for bat casualties conducted by the researchers and a trained dog revealed one dead bat under the 50-m overpass of the two-track railway immediately following the simultaneous passage of two trains. We assumed that there is a lower chance of bat collisions with trains than with cars because of the low level of nighttime traffic on railways, when bats are active, and the specific arrangement of electrified railways. Such railways provide bats with additional open space between tracks with electrification system and the forest edge, or above the catenary for foraging and commuting. Bats utilize this space and avoid flying in the area over the track that is cluttered by the catenary; this may reduce their exposure to passing trains and the likelihood of collisions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEptesicus 3aMyotis 3aNyctalus 3aPipistrellus 3aacoustics 3adogs 3aedge effects 3aflight 3aforests 3amortality 3aopen space 3arailroads 3aresearch 3arisk 3atraffic 3aultrasonics 3aurbanization 3awildlife 3aPoland1 aFurmankiewicz, Joanna0 tEuropean journal of wildlife research.g2022 Feb., v. 68, no. 1 p.5-5dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl4237928x1612-46427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10344-021-01543-w3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02633naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001700140245013100157300001500288520130900303592002801612650002401640650001901664650002401683650002701707650001401734650001901748650002101767650002101788650001501809650001801824650001801842650000901860650001501869650001801884650001301902650001601915650001901931700001501950700001801965773012101983856007402104852000902178655001202187IND60662136920221123011841.0190904e20131218xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066213692DNAL7 a10.1039/c3fo60351b2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Jingqi10aElaboration and characterization of barley protein nanoparticles as an oral delivery system for lipophilic bioactive compounds  ap. 92-101.  aThis is the first report in which barley protein nanoparticles were prepared with the aim of developing a delivery system for lipophilic bioactive compounds at ambient temperature using high pressure homogenization. No organic solvents or crosslinking reagents were involved in the nanoparticle preparation. Effects of processing conditions and formulae on particle size and size distribution were investigated. Optimal nanoparticles with regular spherical shape, small size (90–150 nm) and narrow size distribution (PDI < 0.3) could be achieved at a protein weight concentration of up to 5% when the oil/protein ratio was maintained within a range of 1 to 1.5. These nanoparticles exhibited high zeta-potential (about −35 mV), high payload (51.4–54.5%) and good stability without the use of surfactants. As shown by the release test, though the bulk protein matrices of nanoparticles were degraded in the simulated gastric tract, even smaller nanoparticles were released and bioactive compounds were protected by a layer of barley protein. Then, complete release occurred in the simulated intestinal environments due to pancreatin degradation. In vitro studies showed that barley protein nanoparticles are relatively safe and could be internalized by Caco-2 cells and accumulated in the cytoplasm.  aPublisher supplied data 3aambient temperature 3abarley protein 3abioactive compounds 3across-linking reagents 3acytoplasm 3ahomogenization 3ahuman cell lines 3ain vitro studies 3aintestines 3alipophilicity 3ananoparticles 3aoils 3apancreatin 3aparticle size 3asolvents 3asurfactants 3azeta potential1 aZhou, Ying1 aChen, Lingyun0 tFood & function.g2013 Dec. 18, v. 5, no. 1 p.92-101dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26907x2042-650X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c3fo60351b3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03159naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001900146245016800165300002000333520153900353592002801892650001301920650001301933650002401946650001301970650001301983650001601996650001602012650001402028650001802042650001702060650001902077650001902096650002802115650001802143650002402161650000902185650001102194650001302205653002302218653002102241653001702262653002302279653002102302700001902323700005902342773015102401856008002552852000902632655001202641IND60671572820221119032123.0191003e20190911xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067157282DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jafc.9b035092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Xiao-Wei10aFabrication of Novel Hierarchical Multicompartment Highly Stable Triple Emulsions for the Segregation and Protection of Multiple Cargos by Spatial Co-encapsulation  ap. 10904-10912.  aHigh-order multiple emulsions are of great interest in both fundamental research and industrial applications as vehicles for their encapsulation capability of actives. In this work, we report a hierarchically multicompartmental highly stable triple emulsion by emulsifying and assembling of natural Quillaja saponin. Water-in-oil-in-(oil-in-water) (W₂/O₂/(O₁/W₁)) triple emulsion indicates that the compartmented system consisted of surfaced saponin-coated nanodroplets (SNDs) and dispersed oil globules, which in turn contained smaller aqueous droplets. The effects of formulation parameters, including lipophilic emulsifier content, oil fraction, and SND concentration, on the formation of multiple emulsions were systematically investigated. The assembly into fibrillar network of SNDs at the outer oil–water interface effectively protected the triple emulsion droplets against flocculation and coalescence, and strongly prevented the osmotic-driven water diffusion between the internal water droplets and the external water phase, thus contributing to superior stability during 180 days storage. All of these characteristics make the multicompartmentalized emulsions suitable to co-encapsulate a hydrophilic bioactive (gardenia blue) and two hydrophobic bioactives (eapsanthin and curcumin) in a single emulsion droplet hierarchically for the segregation and protection of multiple cargos. This approach offers a promising route toward accessing the next generation of functional deliveries and encapsulation strategies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGardenia 3aQuillaja 3abioactive compounds 3acurcumin 3adroplets 3aemulsifiers 3aemulsifying 3aemulsions 3aencapsulation 3aflocculation 3ahydrophilicity 3ahydrophobicity 3aindustrial applications 3alipophilicity 3aoil-water interface 3aoils 3aoxygen 3asaponins 0amultiple emulsions 0aQuillaja saponin 0ananodroplets 0ainterface assembly 0adelivery vehicle1 aNing, Xue-Ying1 aYang, Xiao-Quan1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4016-98340 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2019 Sept. 11, v. 67, no. 39 p.10904-10912dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:12177x1520-51187nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jafc.9b035093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03639naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002300139245008600162300001800248520246500266592002802731650001502759650001702774650001302791650001502804650002002819650001502839650001402854650001502868651001402883700002302897700002302920700002702943700002502970700002302995700002103018773012003039856007303159852000903232655001203241IND60082165320221119063833.0141016e201411  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008216532DNAL7 a10.1111/jbi.123632doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJabaily, Rachel S.10aHistorical biogeography of the predominantly Australian plant family Goodeniaceae  ap. 2057-2067.  aAIM: The plant family Goodeniaceae includes 12 genera, largely restricted to Australia. They are a diverse and conspicuous element of the country's ecosystems and an important clade to consider in the effort to reconstruct the historical biogeography of this continent. We used a time‐calibrated molecular phylogeny to perform ancestral‐area reconstructions for the family, in order to: (1) determine its area of origin; (2) test whether vicariance played a role in the history of lineages occupying the south‐western and south‐eastern regions; (3) trace diversification processes in the central arid zone; and (4) trace potential eastward dispersals into the Pacific. LOCATION: Australia and the Pacific. METHODS: We employed a previously published molecular dataset to develop a time‐calibrated phylogeny for the Goodeniaceae using beast 1.6.1 with both primary and secondary node calibrations. Ancestral areas were reconstructed via both dispersal–extinction–cladogenesis (DEC) and statistical dispersal–vicariance analysis (S‐DIVA). RESULTS: The Goodeniaceae split from Asteraceae + Calyceraceae c. 78 Ma, with the divergence of the Lechenaultia, Anthotium and Dampiera (LAD) clade from the remainder of the family c. 67 Ma. Although the geographical origin of the family is equivocal, the LAD clade originated in south‐western Australia, and the remainder of the family, especially Goodenia s.l., probably originated in the central Eremaean zone. The majority of Goodenia cladogenesis events occurred during the Miocene, with expansions to the north, south‐east and south‐west. The crown radiation of Scaevola s.l. occurred later, during the second half of the Miocene, and has involved several recent extra‐Australian dispersals into the Pacific. MAIN CONCLUSIONS: Although it is unclear where in Australia the family originated, our results support a south‐western origin for the LAD clade and considerable diversification of some clades within Goodenia s.l. and Scaevola s.l. in that zone. A relative paucity of mid‐Miocene sister relationships between south‐western and south‐eastern lineages suggests that the occupants of these regions were not affected by contemporary vicariance events. Instead, our results suggest that the aridifying Eremaean zone was an important source and sink for lineages, especially in Goodenia s.l. Dispersal is inferred for the extra‐Australian lineages due to their recent origins.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAsteraceae 3aCalyceraceae 3aScaevola 3aarid zones 3adata collection 3aecosystems 3aphylogeny 3aprovenance 3aAustralia1 aShepherd, Kelly A.1 aGardner, Andrew G.1 aGustafsson, Mats H.

However, due to the diversity of methylation forms, slight difference between methylated sites and nonmodified ones, and ultralow abundance, it is extraordinarily challenging to capture and separate methylated peptides from biological samples. Here, we introduce a simple and highly efficient method to separate methylated and nonmethylated peptides using 18-crown-6 as a mobile phase additive in high-performance liquid chromatography. Selective complexation between lysine and 18-crown-6 remarkably increases the retention of the peptides on a C18 stationary phase, leading to an excellent baseline separation between the lysine methylated and nonmethylated peptides. A possible binding mechanism is verified by nuclear magnetic resonance titration, biolayer interferometry technology, and quantum chemistry calculation. Through establishment of a simple enrichment methodology, a good selectivity is achieved and four methylated peptides with greatly improved signal-to-noise (S/N) ratios are successfully separated from a complex peptide sample containing 10-fold bovine serum albumin tryptic digests. By selecting rLys N as an enzyme to digest histone, methylation information in the histone could be well identified based on our enrichment method. This study will open an avenue and provide a novel insight for selective enrichment of lysine methylated peptides in post-translational modification proteomics.  aPublisher supplied data 3abovine serum albumin 3achromatin 3aenzymes 3aepigenetics 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3ahistones 3ainterferometry 3alysine 3amethylation 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3apeptides 3apost-translational modification 3aproteomics 3asignal transduction 3atitration1 aWang, Cunli1 aLi, Xiaopei1 aQin, Hongqiang1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7508-08721 aYe, Mingliang1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5872-93261 aXiong, Yuting1 aWang, Xue1 aLi, Xiuling1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6016-95161 aLan, Minbo1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4247-00061 aLi, Junyan1 aKe, Yanxiong1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5412-28691 aQing, Guangyan1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4888-93181 aLiang, Xinmiao1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5802-19610 tAnalytical chemistry.g2020 Nov. 10, v. 92, no. 23 p.15663-15670dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:jnl70375x1520-68827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.analchem.0c041583Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02908naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100005700150245013500207520144100342592002801783650001101811650001001822650001101832650001001843650000901853650002401862650002001886651001001906653002001916653002901936653003101965653002501996653002602021653001902047700002702066700002502093700006102118700001802179700006502197700001602262773009002278856008502368852000902453655001202462IND60786175320221123041145.0220929e20221115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078617532DNAL7 a10.1016/j.energy.2022.1248982doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShaik, Saboor1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0490-476610aSpace-age energy saving, carbon emission mitigation and color rendering perspective of architectural antique stained glass windows  aThis article explores optical and thermal characteristics of different colored stained glasses extensively found in historic religious architectures. Solar-optical and color rendering properties of glass samples were explored with spectrophotometry experimentally. Thermal analyses in cardinal and intercardinal orientations were performed to calculate the solar heat gains, building thermal loads, and daylight inflow through the stained glasses for different colored architectural antique stained glasses across two climatic zones (New-Delhi & Tiruchirappalli) of India for energy savings and daylight inflow. A numerical model verified using Design Builder simulations was used to conduct the thermo-economic analysis. Except for blood red and golden yellow samples, whose color rendering metrics (CRI) was below the minimum allowed level in the standard (80), the measured CRI of studied stained glass samples was in the range of 80.15–87.31. For temperate and hot climates, the Olive-green stained glass showed the highest heat gain reductions of 44.85% and 45.42%, respectively, as compared to clear glass. Building operational costs were 20–45% lower with various stained-glass systems compared to clear glass for both climatic conditions. Olive-green stained glass had the highest cost savings of 13.02$/m², carbon emission mitigations of 0.89tCO₂/year along with adequate daylight inflow to avoid artificial daylighting.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon 3acolor 3aenergy 3aglass 3aheat 3amathematical models 3asolar radiation 3aIndia 0aStained glasses 0aThermo-economic analysis 0aCarbon emission mitigation 0aVisual acceptability 0aColor rendering index 0aEnergy savings1 aMaduru, Venkata Ramana1 aKirankumar, Gorantla1 aArıcı, Müslüm1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3397-22151 aGhosh, Aritra1 aKontoleon, Karolos J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1022-91971 aAfzal, Asif0 tEnergy.g2022 Nov. 15, v. 259 p.124898-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12436x0360-54427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2022.1248983Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03275naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002500151245012700176300001800303520152100321592002801842650002201870650002901892650002001921650001501941650001301956650001601969650001301985650001601998650001402014650001302028650001102041650001202052650002002064650001602084650002202100650001302122650001202135653001302147653002602160653002602186653001502212653001202227700001702239700001902256700001702275700001502292700001602307700001702323700001702340700001702357700001402374700001402388700001602402700001202418773009902430856008602529961001302615852000902628655001202637IND60535072620221120190939.0190319e20150609xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053507262DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vaccine.2015.04.0652doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGalliher-Beckley, A.10aCharacterization of a novel oil-in-water emulsion adjuvant for swine influenza virus and Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae vaccines  ap. 2903-2908.  aVaccines consisting of subunit or inactivated bacteria/virus and potent adjuvants are widely used to control and prevent infectious diseases. Because inactivated and subunit antigens are often less antigenic than live microbes, a growing need exists for the development of new and improved vaccine adjuvants that can elicit rapid and long-lasting immunity. Here we describe the development and characterization of a novel oil-in-water emulsion, OW-14. OW-14 contains low-cost plant-based emulsifiers and was added to antigen at a ratio of 1:3 with simple hand mixing. OW-14 was stable for prolonged periods of time at temperatures ranging from 4 to 40°C and could be sterilized by autoclaving. Our results showed that OW-14 adjuvanted inactivated swine influenza viruses (SIV; H3N2 and H1N1) and Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae (M. hyo) vaccines could be safely administered to piglets in two doses, three weeks apart. Injection sites were monitored and no adverse reactions were observed. Vaccinated pigs developed high and prolonged antibody titers to both SIV and M. hyo. Interestingly, antibody titers were either comparable or greater than those produced by commercially available FluSure (SIV) or RespiSure (M. hyo) vaccines. We also found that OW-14 can induce high antibody responses in pigs that were vaccinated with a decreased antigen dose. This study provides direct evidence that we have developed an easy-to-use and low-cost emulsion that can act as a powerful adjuvant in two common types of swine vaccines.  aPublisher supplied data 3aInfluenza A virus 3aMycoplasma hyopneumoniae 3aadverse effects 3aantibodies 3aantigens 3aautoclaving 3abacteria 3aemulsifiers 3aemulsions 3aimmunity 3amixing 3apiglets 3aswine influenza 3atemperature 3avaccine adjuvants 3avaccines 3aviruses 0aAdjuvant 0aOil-in-water emulsion 0aSwine influenza virus 0aMycoplasma 0aVaccine1 aPappan, L.K.1 aMadera, Rachel1 aBurakova, Y.1 aWaters, A.1 aNickles, M.1 aLi, Xunjing,1 aNietfeld, J.1 aSchlup, J.R.1 aZhong, Q.1 aMcVey, S.1 aDritz, S.S.1 aShi, J.0 tVaccine.g2015 June 09, v. 33, no. 25 p.2903-2908dElsevier LtdwJournal:6210x0264-410X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2015.04.0653Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/ARS  aDNAL 7aarticle02654naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002200143245009000165500001400255520144100269592002801710650000801738650003101746650001701777650001701794650002401811650001101835650002201846650001101868650002601879650001301905650000901918650001401927650002501941700002001966700002301986700002202009773012702031856007702158852000902235655001202244IND60715222720221119113527.0201026e20200929xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071522272DNAL7 a10.3390/antiox91009352doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZiegler, Melanie 10aCardiovascular and Metabolic Protection by Vitamin E: A Matter of Treatment Strategy?  aNAL-light  aCardiovascular diseases (CVD) cause about 1/3 of global deaths. Therefore, new strategies for the prevention and treatment of cardiovascular events are highly sought-after. Vitamin E is known for significant antioxidative and anti-inflammatory properties, and has been studied in the prevention of CVD, supported by findings that vitamin E deficiency is associated with increased risk of cardiovascular events. However, randomized controlled trials in humans reveal conflicting and ultimately disappointing results regarding the reduction of cardiovascular events with vitamin E supplementation. As we discuss in detail, this outcome is strongly affected by study design, cohort selection, co-morbidities, genetic variations, age, and gender. For effective chronic primary and secondary prevention by vitamin E, oxidative and inflammatory status might not have been sufficiently antagonized. In contrast, acute administration of vitamin E may be more translatable into positive clinical outcomes. In patients with myocardial infarction (MI), which is associated with severe oxidative and inflammatory reactions, decreased plasma levels of vitamin E have been found. The offsetting of this acute vitamin E deficiency via short-term treatment in MI has shown promising results, and, thus, acute medication, rather than chronic supplementation, with vitamin E might revitalize vitamin E therapy and even provide positive clinical outcomes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aage 3aanti-inflammatory activity 3aantioxidants 3adrug therapy 3aexperimental design 3agender 3agenetic variation 3ahumans 3amyocardial infarction 3apatients 3arisk 3avitamin E 3avitamin E deficiency1 aWallert, Maria 1 aLorkowski, Stefan 1 aPeter, Karlheinz 0 tAntioxidants.g2020 Sept. 29, v. 9, no. 10dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27130x2076-39217nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/antiox91009353Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01727naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001700149245013100166300001800297500001500315520062200330592002800952650001300980650002300993650001601016650001901032650001501051650002301066653001801089700001301107700001901120700001301139700001401152773010501166856008501271852000901356655001201365IND60579353020221116164522.0170816e20170317xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057935302DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.orglett.7b003472doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDai, Jingwen12aA Diheteroatom Fluoroalkylation Reagent for Preparation of S- and N-Containing Fluoroalkyl Compounds and Sulfonic Acid Polymer  ap. 1418-1421.  a2019-12-06  aThe first stable diheteroatom fluoroalkylation reagent, 2-((2-azido-1-chloro-1,2,2-trifluoroethyl)thio)pyrimidine (ACTP), has been prepared by a novel method.

DCs are present in peripheral tissues in steady state; however in response to antigen stimulation, DCs take up the antigen and rapidly migrate to the draining lymph nodes where they initiate T cell response against the antigen1,2. Additionally, DCs also play a key role in initiating autoimmune as well as allergic immune response3. DCs play an essential role in both initiation of immune response and induction of tolerance in the setting of lung environment4. Lung environment is largely tolerogenic, owing to the exposure to vast array of environmental antigens5. However, in some individuals there is a break in tolerance, which leads to induction of allergy and asthma. In this study, we describe a strategy, which can be used to monitor airway DC maturation and migration in response to the antigen used for sensitization. The measurement of airway DC maturation and migration allows for assessment of the kinetics of immune response during airway allergic inflammation and also assists in understanding the magnitude of the subsequent immune response along with the underlying mechanisms. Our strategy is based on the use of ovalbumin as a sensitizing agent. Ovalbumin-induced allergic asthma is a widely used model to reproduce the airway eosinophilia, pulmonary inflammation and elevated IgE levels found during asthma6,7. After sensitization, mice are challenged by intranasal delivery of FITC labeled ovalbumin, which allows for specific labeling of airway DCs which uptake ovalbumin. Next, using several DC specific markers, we can assess the maturation of these DCs and can also assess their migration to the draining lymph nodes by employing flow cytometry.  aPublisher supplied data 3aovalbumin 3aantigens 3aT-lymphocytes 3aadaptive immunity 3adendritic cells 3ainflammation 3aflow cytometry 3amodels 3amice 3aimmunoglobulin E 3aasthma 3atissues 3aimmune response 3alungs 3alymph nodes 3aeosinophilia 0ahypersensitivity1 aHu, Jim0 tJournal of visualized experiments.g2012 July 23, , no. 65 p.e4014-e4014dJournal of Visualized ExperimentswJournal:jnl4469330x1940-087X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3791/40143Available from publisher's site  uhttp://www.jove.com/video/4014/analysis-pulmonary-dendritic-cell-maturation-migration-during  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02157naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245011500170300002000285500001900305520089200324592002801216650002501244650002001269650002001289650001701309650001601326650001401342650002201356650001401378700001301392700001501405700001501420700005801435700005401493773013101547856008401678852000901762655001201771IND60719259820221118011440.0201201e20201111xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071925982DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.analchem.0c043012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Yangyang10aIntratumoral Glutathione Activatable Nanoprobes for Fluorescence and ¹⁹F Magnetic Resonance Turn-On Imaging  ap. 15679-15684.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aTumor microenvironment turn-on nanoprobes that could specifically detect the occurrence of diseases possess great potential in early diagnosis.

These unique behavioral data enable us to explore the group-level, dynamic, spatial, and social patterns of preschool children's playing behavior from a hybrid geographic and social perspective. In this research, GIS and exploratory spatial data analysis (ESDA) techniques are employed together to study group-level spatial and social behavior emerging from children's everyday activities and interactions. ESDA with social weights is proposed to explore spatial and social patterns of preschool children's behavior at the same time. The results highlight the utility of this approach for studying the relationships between preschool children's playing behavior and preschool's environmental settings and the relationships between preschool children's personal activities and the formation of their social network space.  aPublisher supplied data 3ageographic information systems 3ageography 3aplay activities 3apreschool children 3asocial behavior 3asocial networks 3aspatial data 0aESDA 0aSocial weights 0aSocial autocorrelation 0aPreschool children1 aGriffin, William A.0 tApplied geography.g2013 Sept., v. 43 p.67-80dElsevier LtdwJournal:11785x0143-62287nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apgeog.2013.06.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02283naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001500147245013800162300001800300520115100318592002801469650001201497650001501509650001401524650001901538650002101557650001501578650000901593650001801602650002401620650001801644700001501662700001701677700001301694773011201707856008101819852000901900655001201909IND60465818820221123011037.0151123e201511  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6046581882DNAL7 a10.1007/s12010-015-1805-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNie, Kaili10aStrategy to Overcome Effect of Raw Materials on Enzymatic Process of Biodiesel from Non-edible Oils Using Candida sp. 99–125 Lipase  ap. 1176-1185.  aNon-edible oils are preferred raw materials for biodiesel production. However, the properties of raw materials significantly affect the synthesis process, leading to difficulties to design one process suitable for any kind of raw material. In this study, the composition of five typical non-edible oils was analyzed. The major difference was the content of free fatty acids, reflected from their acid values. The influence of different oils was investigated by using lipase from Candida sp. 99–125. At low lipase dosage and low water content, the conversion was found proportional to the acid value. However, by increasing the water content or lipase dosage, we observed that the conversions for all kinds of oils used in this study could exceed 80 %. Time course analysis indicates that the lipase used in this study catalyzed hydrolysis followed by esterification, rather than direct transesterification. Accumulation of free fatty acids at the very beginning was necessary. A high water content facilitated the hydrolysis of oils with low acid value. This lipase showed capability to transform all the oils by controlling the water content.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCandida 3aacid value 3abiodiesel 3aesterification 3afree fatty acids 3ahydrolysis 3aoils 3araw materials 3atransesterification 3awater content1 aWang, Fang1 aTan, Tianwei1 aLiu, Luo0 tApplied biochemistry and biotechnology.g2015 Nov., v. 177, no. 5 p.1176-1185dSpringer USx0273-22897nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12010-015-1805-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02734naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002500140245010100165300001800266520126200284592002801546650002301574650002501597650002301622650001801645650002001663650002101683650003601704650001801740650002601758650001601784650000901800650003701809650001701846650002201863650002401885650003601909650001101945650003201956700001801988700003002006700002102036773012402057856007402181852000902255655001202264IND60662137420221123030156.0190904e20140625xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066213742DNAL7 a10.1039/c3fo60360a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKumalasari, Ika Dyah10aActivation of macrophages stimulated by the bengkoang fiber extract through toll-like receptor 4  ap. 1403-1408.  aBengkoang (Pachyrhizus erosus (L.) Urban) is an edible root tuber containing fairly large amounts of carbohydrates and crude fibers. Our previous studies showed that the bengkoang fiber extract (BFE) stimulates activation of macrophages, leading to induction of phagocytotic activity and cytokine production. In the present study we investigated the mechanism underlying activation of murine macrophages by BFE. BFE increased production of TNF-α, IL-6, and nitric oxide by J774.1 cells. In addition BFE also facilitated the gene expression levels of inducible nitric oxide synthase. We examined the effect of a TLR4 inhibitor on cytokine production to investigate the membrane receptor of macrophage activation by BFE. Treatment of J774.1 cells with the TLR4 inhibitor significantly inhibited production of IL-6 and TNF-α, suggesting that TLR4 is the target membrane receptor for BFE. The main signal molecules located downstream of TLR4 such as JNK, p38, ERK, and NF-κB were activated by BFE treatment. The immunostimulatory effect of BFE was cancelled by the pectinase treatment, suggesting that the active ingredient in BFE is pectin-like molecules. Overall results suggested that BFE activates J774.1 cells via the MAPK and NF-κB signaling pathways.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPachyrhizus erosus 3aToll-like receptor 4 3aactive ingredients 3acarbohydrates 3agene expression 3aimmunostimulants 3ainducible nitric oxide synthase 3ainterleukin-6 3amacrophage activation 3amacrophages 3amice 3amitogen-activated protein kinase 3anitric oxide 3apolygalacturonase 3asignal transduction 3atranscription factor NF-kappa B 3atubers 3atumor necrosis factor-alpha1 aNishi, Kosuke1 aPutra, Agus Budiawan Naro1 aSugahara, Takuya0 tFood & function.g2014 June 25, v. 5, no. 7 p.1403-1408dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26907x2042-650X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c3fo60360a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03992naa a2200709 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002100151245013800172300001800310520203600328592002802364650002902392650002102421650001402442650001002456650002102466650001202487650001102499650002102510650002002531650001402551650001402565650001402579650001502593650001102608650001402619650002002633650002402653650001602677650001302693651001102706653000802717653000802725653000802733653001002741653000902751653000902760653000802769653000802777653001302785653004002798653003402838653001402872653002202886653001402908700002002922700002002942700001602962700001802978700001802996700002303014700001903037700002003056773009903076856008603175852000903261655001203270IND60535072920221120190924.0190319e20150609xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053507292DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vaccine.2015.04.0682doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTsai, Ying-Huang14aThe 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine is effective in elderly adults over 75 years old—Taiwan's PPV vaccination program  ap. 2897-2902.  aPneumococcal infection is a serious cause of mortality and morbidity in the elderly. A nationwide pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPV) program for elderly adults aged 75 years and older was conducted in Taiwan in 2008. The efficacy of the PPV in this very elderly population was evaluated.The data were analyzed using the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD), the cause-of-death registration database and the invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) notification database of Taiwan's Ministry of Health and Welfare. The efficacy of PPV administration in this very elderly population was evaluated using multivariate logistic regression after propensity score matching (PSM). The rates of IPD, death from IPD, pneumonia hospitalization, death from pneumonia, and all-cause mortality were compared for those who did and did not receive the PPV.Among the 1078,955 eligible people, 318,257 (29.5%) received the PPV, and 760,698 (70.5%) were not vaccinated. Using PSM to adjust for confounding factors, including age, gender, influenza vaccination status, associated chronic diseases and health care utilization, those who received the PPV had significantly lower odds ratios (ORs) for IPD (OR=0.24, 95% CI=0.123–0.461, p<0.001), death from IPD (OR=0.09, 95% CI=0.011–0.704, p<0.022, p<0.001), pneumonia hospitalization (OR=0.40, 95% CI=0.395–0.415, p<0.001), death from pneumonia (OR=0.07, 95% CI=0.059–0.082, p<0.001), and all-cause mortality (OR=0.07, 95% CI=0.069–0.072, p<0.001) compared with those who were not vaccinated.PPV vaccination in the previous year was associated with a 60% reduction in pneumonia hospitalization, a 76% reduction in IPD, and a greater than 90% reduction in death from pneumonia, IPD and all causes among people over 75 years old in Taiwan. Data from subsequent years in Taiwan and similar populations elsewhere are needed to evaluate the contribution of underlying variations in the mortality rate and the confounding effects of prior disease severity to these findings.  aPublisher supplied data 3aStreptococcus pneumoniae 3achronic diseases 3adatabases 3adeath 3adisease severity 3aelderly 3agender 3ahealth insurance 3ahealth services 3ainfluenza 3amorbidity 3amortality 3aodds ratio 3apeople 3apneumonia 3apolysaccharides 3aregression analysis 3avaccination 3avaccines 3aTaiwan 0aPPV 0aPCV 0aIPD 0aNHIRD 0aACIP 0aJCVI 0aCDC 0aPSM 0aICD-9-CM 0aPneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine 0aInvasive pneumococcal disease 0aPneumonia 0aInfluenza vaccine 0aMortality1 aHsieh, Meng-Jer1 aChang, Chee-Jen1 aWen, Yu-Wen1 aHu, Han-Chung1 aZhao, Yannan,1 aHuang, Yhu-Chering1 aYang, Cheng-Ta1 aHuang, Zhongji,0 tVaccine.g2015 June 09, v. 33, no. 25 p.2897-2902dElsevier LtdwJournal:6210x0264-410X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2015.04.0683Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02642naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001600150245008200166300001400248520142600262592002801688650001701716650001801733650003501751650001401786650002401800650002201824650001101846650001801857650001701875650001701892651000901909653001701918653001701935653002301952653001801975653002101993700001602014773009602030856008502126852000902211655001202220IND60086928620221118231705.0190318e201309  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008692862DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apgeog.2013.05.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Xiang10aInteractive three-dimensional geovisualization of space–time access to food  ap. 81-86.  aA majority of literature about food deserts is focused on geographic access to food retailers by a buffered distance differentiating high and low access. An overlooked facet in this representation is that food acquisition is not only geographically dictated, but it is also temporally constrained. Food retailers invariably have limited opening hours that create a temporal restriction for shoppers. In this paper, a three-dimensional (3D) construct was proposed to delineate the limited food access to a retailer location across space and over its time of operation. Food retailer data in Columbus, OH, USA were collected for examining the variation of food access on both spatial and temporal scales. This study also employed the technique of interactive 3D modeling in a geographic information system (GIS) to visualize the food environment to delimit where and when food is accessible on a daily basis. The interactive 3D geovisualization (visualization of geographic information) of space–time access contributed to improving the representation of food environment and exploring the inequity of food access across space and over time. The development of this geovisualization context for food science studies could assist public health professionals and government stakeholders in understanding the effect of temporal access and improving food access for regions with limited operation hours in policy formulation.  aPublisher supplied data 3afood science 3afood security 3ageographic information systems 3ageography 3ahealth care workers 3aissues and policy 3amodels 3apublic health 3aspatial data 3astakeholders 3aOhio 0aFood deserts 0aSpace–time 0aFood accessibility 0aOpening hours 0aGeovisualization1 aClark, Jill0 tApplied geography.g2013 Sept., v. 43 p.81-86dElsevier LtdwJournal:11785x0143-62287nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apgeog.2013.05.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle05169naa a2200685 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100005400144245016100198300001800359506010400377506007600481520255300557592002803110506003703138650001303175650001503188650002603203650002903229650002503258650001703283650002003300650001303320650001203333650001603345650000903361650002103370650000703391650001103398650002303409650002303432650001103455653002503466653002603491653002903517653002503546653001503571700001603586700001603602700001503618700005703633700005803690700005503748700005303803700005603856700001703912700005503929700006503984700005304049700005304102700001604155700005804171773015404229856007904383852000904462655001204471IND60767733520221207071839.0220326e202204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076773352DNAL7 a10.3168/jds.2021-212672doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPegolo, S.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6390-982610aQuarter-level analyses of the associations among subclinical intramammary infection and milk quality, udder health, and cheesemaking traits in Holstein cows  ap. 3490-3507.  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aIn this study, we investigated associations among subclinical intra-mammary infection (IMI) and quarter-level milk composition, udder health indicators, and cheesemaking traits. The dataset included records from 450 Holstein cows belonging to three dairy herds. After an initial screening (T0) to identify animals infected by Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus uberis, Staphylococcus aureus, and Prototheca spp., 613 quarter milk samples for 2 different sampling times (T1 and T2, 1 mo after T1) were used for analysis. Milk traits were analyzed using a hierarchical linear mixed model including the effects of days in milk, parity and herd, and bacteriological and inflammatory category [culture negative with somatic cell count (SCC) <200,000 cells/mL; culture negative with SCC ≥200,000 cells/mL; or culture positive]. All udder health indicators were associated with increased SCC and IMI at both sampling times. The largest effects were detected at T2 for milk lactose (−7% and −5%) and milk conductivity (+9% and +8%). In contrast, the increase in differential SCC (DSCC) in samples with elevated SCC was larger at T1 (+17%). Culture-negative samples with SCC ≥200,000 cells/mL had the highest SCC and greatest numbers of polymorphonuclear-neutrophils-lymphocytes and macrophages at both T1 and T2. Regarding milk cheesemaking ability, samples with elevated SCC showed the worst pattern of curd firmness at T1 and T2. At T2, increased SCC and IMI induced large decreases in recoveries of nutrients into the curd, in particular recovered protein (−14% and −16%) and recovered fat (−12% and −14%). Different behaviors were observed between Strep. agalactiae and Prototheca spp., especially at T2. In particular, samples that were positive for Strep. agalactiae had higher proportions of DSCC (+19%) compared with negative samples with low SCC, whereas samples that were positive for Prototheca spp. had lower DSCC (−11%). Intramammary infection with Prototheca spp. increased milk pH compared with culture-negative samples (+3%) and negative samples that had increased SCC (+2%). The greatest impairment in curd firmness at 30 min from rennet addition was observed for samples that were positive for Prototheca spp. (−99% compared with negative samples, and −98% compared with negative samples with high SCC). These results suggest that IMI caused by Prototheca spp. have detrimental effects on milk technological traits that deserve further investigation of the mechanisms underlying animals' responses to infection.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aHolstein 3aPrototheca 3aStaphylococcus aureus 3aStreptococcus agalactiae 3aStreptococcus uberis 3acheesemaking 3adata collection 3afirmness 3alactose 3amacrophages 3amilk 3amilk composition 3apH 3arennet 3asomatic cell count 3astatistical models 3audders 0asubclinical mastitis 0aStaphylococcus aureus 0aStreptococcus agalactiae 0aStreptococcus uberis 0aPrototheca1 aTessari, R.1 aBisutti, V.1 aVanzin, A.1 aGiannuzzi, D.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2975-03851 aGianesella, M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8117-59691 aLisuzzo, A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7064-07491 aFiore, E.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0377-95531 aBarberio, A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3108-83541 aSchiavon, E.1 aTrevisi, E.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1644-19111 aPiccioli Cappelli, F.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1277-78211 aGallo, L.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8908-51051 aRuegg, P.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7211-45121 aNegrini, R.1 aCecchinato, A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3518-720X0 tJournal of dairy science.g2022 Apr., v. 105, no. 4 p.3490-3507dElsevier Inc.aAmerican Dairy Science AssociationwJournal:jnl45500x0022-03027nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3168/jds.2021-212673Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02342naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245010700168300001800275520098300293592002801276650002301304650001901327650001101346650001801357650002701375650002601402650001101428650001401439650003701453700002501490700002201515700002001537700001701557700002201574700002101596700001601617700001901633700002201652700002201674773010501696856008601801852000901887655001201896IND60578310020180802000000.0170812e20170711xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057831002DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.macromol.7b009542doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMusino, Dafne10aSynergistic Effect of Small Molecules on Large-Scale Structure of Simplified Industrial Nanocomposites  ap. 5138-5145.  aThe microstructure of polymer nanocomposites made with disordered silica filler (Zeosil(R) 1165MP) of industrial relevance and various coating agents is quantitatively analyzed using a combination of SAXS, TEM, and a recently developed structural model. The polymer matrix is formed by an end-functionalized styrene–butadiene statistical copolymer capable of covalent grafting on the silica nanoparticles. The effect of the coating agents with different alkyl chain length (C₈, C₁₂, and C₁₈) on filler structure quantified in terms of aggregate formation, for different concentrations (up to 8 wt % with respect to silica), and the effect of a commonly added catalyzer, DPG, are studied using the structural model. As a result, we show that a strongly synergetic effect of both DPG and coating agent exists. Our findings open the road to a fundamental understanding and rational design of model and industrial nanocomposite formulation with optimized coating agents.  aPublisher supplied data 3acomposite polymers 3amicrostructure 3amodels 3ananoparticles 3apolymer nanocomposites 3aquantitative analysis 3asilica 3asynergism 3atransmission electron microscopy1 aGenix, Anne-Caroline1 aFayolle, Caroline1 aPapon, Aurélie1 aGuy, Laurent1 aMeissner, Natalia1 aKozak, Radosław1 aWeda, Pawel1 aBizien, Thomas1 aChaussée, Thomas1 aOberdisse, Julian0 tMacromolecules.g2017 July 11, v. 50, no. 13 p.5138-5145dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-58357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.macromol.7b009543Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02494naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245009000167520122500257592002801482650001501510650001101525650001401536650001001550650001301560650001801573650001101591650001101602653002301613653001301636653001901649653001701668653001601685653002301701700002001724700007401744700002101818700001501839700002201854773009001876856008501966852000902051655001202060IND60680725220221122122300.0200210e20200215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068072522DNAL7 a10.1016/j.energy.2019.1168012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Zhixiong14aThe effect of sinusoidal wall on hydrogen jet mixing rate considering supersonic flow  aThe efficiency of the scramjet is highly associated with the rate of the mixing through the combustion tank. In current article, simulation approach was used to inspect the effect of the sinusoidal wall on hydrogen mixing cross-flow jet. The key focus of current paper is to exhibit the role of various sinusoidal profiles on the flow structure and streamline pattern of the mainstream and fuel jet. To simulate the flow feature, a 3D model was chosen and Navier-stocks equations were solved with energy and species mass transport equations to evaluate the mixing rate of hydrogen jet. Hydrogen gas is injected through the nozzle in the downstream of the sinusoidal wave. The impact of total jet pressure on the flow feature is exclusively studied. Also, the mixing zones of the various models are compared. Attained results display that the appearance of the wavy wall augments the mixing rate when the frequency of the sinusoidal wave is high enough. Our findings also reveal that using extended surface has less effect in high pressure condition. The comparison of the mixing rate shows that the presence of sinusoidal wavy wall with frequency of 1200 increases the mixing rate more than 25% than simple flat surface.  aPublisher supplied data 3acombustion 3aenergy 3aequations 3afuels 3ahydrogen 3amass transfer 3amixing 3amodels 0aUpstream wavy wall 0aScramjet 0aFuel spreading 0aHydrogen jet 0aFuel mixing 0aCombustion chamber1 aManh, Tran Dinh1 aBarzegar Gerdroodbary, Mostafa1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8243-94761 aNam, Nguyen Dang1 aMoradi, R.1 aBabazadeh, Houman0 tEnergy.g2020 Feb. 15, v. 193 p.116801-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12436x0360-54427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2019.1168013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01210naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002300148245004800171300001600219520035800235592002800593650001500621650001300636650001700649650003000666700002000696773009000716856008200806990002300888852000900911655001200920IND60092820220221121061632.0141103e20120808xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009282022DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cmet.2012.07.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAnthony, Tracy G.10aTXNIP Switches Tracks toward a Terminal UPR  ap. 135-137.  aDuring the progression of diabetes, crosstalk between ER stress and inflammation controls islet cell fate.

Both exist in autoinhibited forms, and activation of vinculin requires binding to mechanically activated talin, yet how forces affect talin’s interaction with vinculin has not been investigated. Here by quantifying the kinetics of force-dependent talin–vinculin interactions using single-molecule analysis, we show that mechanical exposure of a single vinculin binding site (VBS) in talin is sufficient to relieve the autoinhibition of vinculin, resulting in high-affinity binding. We provide evidence that the vinculin undergoes dynamic fluctuations between an autoinhibited closed conformation and an open conformation that is stabilized upon binding to the VBS. Furthermore, we discover an additional level of regulation in which the mechanically exposed VBS binds vinculin significantly more tightly than the isolated VBS alone. Molecular dynamics simulations reveal the basis of this new regulatory mechanism, identifying a sensitive force-dependent change in the conformation of an exposed VBS that modulates binding. Together, these results provide a comprehensive understanding of how the interplay between force and autoinhibition provides exquisite complexity within this major mechanosensing axis.  aPublisher supplied data  aBB/N007336/1cBiotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Councildhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100000268  aBB/S007245/1cBiotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Councildhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100000268  aRGP00001/2016cHuman Frontier Science Programdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100000854  aMOE2019-T2-1-099cMinistry of Education - Singaporedhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100001459 3aAmericans 3abinding sites 3acell adhesion 3acell-matrix junctions 3aforces 3ajournals 3amolecular dynamics 3atalin1 aYao, Mingxi1 aBaker, Karen B.1 aGough, Rosemarie E.1 aLe, Shimin1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2359-18971 aGoult, Benjamin T.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3438-28071 aYan, Jie1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8555-72910 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2021 Aug. 31, v. 143, no. 36 p.14726-14737dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19166x1520-51267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jacs.1c062233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03147naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002100150245019100171300001400362520143000376592002801806650001601834650002001850650003501870650002501905650002201930650001701952650001401969650002101983650001102004650002202015650001302037650002002050650002002070650003302090650001302123653002202136653001802158653002802176653002002204653002602224700002302250700001902273700005302292700002202345700002402367700002102391773011202412856008402524852000902608655001202617IND60599189620221122133009.0180702e20140627xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059918962DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chroma.2014.04.0832doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBuncherd, Hansuk10aIsolation of cross-linked peptides by diagonal strong cation exchange chromatography for protein complex topology studies by peptide fragment fingerprinting from large sequence databases  ap. 34-46.  aKnowledge of spatial proximity of amino acid residues obtained by chemical cross-linking and mass spectrometric analysis provides information about protein folding, protein–protein interactions and topology of macromolecular assemblies. We show that the use of bis(succinimidyl)-3-azidomethyl glutarate as a cross-linker provides a solution for two major analytical problems of cross-link mapping by peptide fragment fingerprinting (PFF) from complex sequence databases, i.e., low abundance of protease-generated target peptides and lack of knowledge of the masses of linked peptides. Tris(carboxyethyl)phosphine (TCEP) reduces the azido group in cross-linked peptides to an amine group in competition with cleavage of an amide bond formed in the cross-link reaction. TCEP-induced reaction products were separated by diagonal strong cation exchange (SCX) from unmodified peptides. The relation between the sum of the masses of the cleavage products and the mass of the parent cross-linked peptide enables determination of the masses of candidate linked peptides. By reversed phase LC–MS/MS analysis of secondary SCX fractions, we identified several intraprotein and interprotein cross-links in a HeLa cell nuclear extract, aided by software tools supporting PFF from the entire human sequence database. The data provide new information about interacting protein domains, among others from assemblies involved in splicing.  aPublisher supplied data 3aamino acids 3acation exchange 3acation exchange chromatography 3acleavage (chemistry) 3acomputer software 3acrosslinking 3adatabases 3ahuman cell lines 3ahumans 3amass spectrometry 3apeptides 3aprotein domains 3aprotein folding 3aprotein-protein interactions 3atopology 0aMass spectrometry 0aCross-linking 0aDiagonal chromatography 0aNuclear extract 0aStructural proteomics1 aRoseboom, Winfried1 aGhavim, Behrad1 aDu, Weina1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3309-46511 ade Koning, Leo J.1 ade Koster, Chris G.1 ade Jong, Luitzen0 tJournal of chromatography.g2014 June 27, v. 1348 p.34-46dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl50504x0021-96737nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chroma.2014.04.0833Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03445naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100002100154245009800175300001200273506002800285520227300313592002802586506003702614650002402651650001402675650001102689650001002700653002202710653001702732653002002749653001902769700001902788700001902807773015902826856008902985852000903074655001203083IND60739571420221215142550.0180529e201804  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073957142DNAL7 a10.22314/2073-7599-2018-12-2-4-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhalnin, Ė.

(Purpose of research) This led to a variety in the name of harvester models, which significantly complicates the assessment of their technical level, complicates the choice of agricultural necessary to him fashion, does not give the perception of the continuity of the change of generations of combines, makes it impossible to analyze trends in their development, does not disclose the technological essence of a model, but - most importantly - combines can not be compared with each other. The figures in the name of the harvester model are not related functionally to the main parameters and performance capabilities. (Materials and methods) The close correlation in the form of a linear equation between their design parameters and the capacity of combines was revealed. Verification of this equation in the process of operation of the combine showed that it statistically stable and the estimates are always within the confidence interval with an error of 5-8 percent. It was found that four parameters of the variety of factors, that affect the performance of the harvester per hour net time, having most close correlation with it are: the motor power and the square of the separation concave, straw walkers and sieves for cleaning. (Results and discussion) On the basis of the revealed correlation dependence we proposed a new method of assessment of the technical level of combines, which is based on the throughput (kg/s) of the wetted material and the size series, indicating the nominal productivity of the combine in centners of grain harvested in 1 hour of basic time. The methodological background and mathematical apparatus, linking these indicators with the basic parameters of the combine, were formed. (Conclusions) It was noted that the application of the proposed method makes it possible to arrange all combines of the world in a certain hierarchical sequence and compare them with each other in performance  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aconfidence interval 3aequations 3amodels 3astraw 0acombine harvester 0aproductivity 0atechnical level 0aclassification1 aTsench, Yu.

This antibacterial activity was lost on treatment with protease indicating that the bacteriocin is proteinaceous in nature. The bacteriocin LJR1 produced by P. pentosaceus was purified following a three step procedure consisting of ammonium sulphate precipitation, gel filtration chromatography and reverse phase-high performance liquid chromatography. The molecular weight of purified bacteriocin was determined to be 4.6 kDa using Tricine SDS-PAGE. Further, we found that the proteinaceous bacteriocin was stable at 100 °C as well as 121 °C for 30 min and 15 min respectively and also at different pH ranging from 4 to 10 when stored for 15 min at 37 °C. Its minimum inhibitory concentration for S. typhi MTCC134 and L. monocytogenes MTCC 1143 was 7.81 µg/ml and 15.63 µg/ml respectively. Scanning electron microscopy analysis of the surface of S. typhi treated with the bacteriocin showed the presence of craters; while in the case of treated L. monocytogenes blebs were observed. The addition of the bacteriocin to shrimp (white leg shrimp) has led to reduction of about 1 log units of L. monocytogenes on day 1 and maintained for 7 days on storage at 4 °C. It is clear that the purified bacteriocin has good potential as a bio preservative for application in food industry.  aPublisher supplied data  a(No.F.7-370/2012)cUniversity Grants Commission 3aListeria monocytogenes 3aPediococcus pentosaceus 3aammonium sulfate 3aantibacterial properties 3aantimicrobial peptides 3abacteriocins 3afood industry 3agel chromatography 3agoats 3alactic acid bacteria 3aminimum inhibitory concentration 3amolecular weight 3apH 3apolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis 3aproteinases 3areversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography 3arumen fluids 3ascanning electron microscopy 3ashrimp 3astorage temperature1 aJeevaratnam, Kadirvelu1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7770-86860 tWorld journal of microbiology & biotechnology.g2020 May, v. 36, no. 5 p.72-72dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl44995x0959-39937nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11274-020-02847-w3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02828naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002600147245016300173300002000336520142700356592002801783650001801811650002301829650001101852650002601863650002001889650001001909650001201919650001501931650001601946650002801962650001901990650001302009700002302022700002302045700002202068700001902090700002402109700002102133773015002154856008102304852000902385655001202394IND60440190420221119040029.0151024e201509  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6044019042DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-015-4273-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGoñi-Urriza, Marisol10aRelationships between bacterial energetic metabolism, mercury methylation potential, and hgcA/hgcB gene expression in Desulfovibrio dechloroacetivorans BerOc1  ap. 13764-13771.  aThe proteins encoded by the hgcA and hgcB genes are currently the only ones known to be involved in the mercury methylation by anaerobic microorganisms. However, no studies have been published to determine the relationships between their expression level and the net/gross methylmercury production. This study aimed to decipher the effect of growth conditions on methylmercury production and the relationships between hgcA and hgcB expression levels and net methylation. Desulfovibrio dechloroacetivorans strain BerOc1 was grown under sulfidogenic conditions with different carbon sources and electron donors as well as under fumarate respiration. A good correlation was found between the biomass production and the methylmercury production when the strain was grown under sulfate-reducing conditions. Methylmercury production was much higher under fumarate respiration when no sulfide was produced. During exponential growth, hgcA and hgcB gene expression levels were only slightly higher in the presence of inorganic mercury, and it was difficult to conclude whether there was a significant induction of hgcA and hgcB genes by inorganic mercury. Besides, no relationships between hgcA and hgcB expression levels and net mercury methylation could be observed when the strain was grown either under sulfate reduction or fumarate respiration, indicating that environmental factors had more influence than expression levels.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDesulfovibrio 3abiomass production 3acarbon 3aenvironmental factors 3agene expression 3agenes 3amercury 3ametabolism 3amethylation 3amethylmercury compounds 3amicroorganisms 3aproteins1 aCorsellis, Yannick1 aLanceleur, Laurent1 aTessier, Emmanuel1 aGury, Jérôme1 aMonperrus, Mathilde1 aGuyoneaud, Rémy0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research international.g2015 Sept., v. 22, no. 18 p.13764-13771dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx0944-13447nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-015-4273-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02526naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001500150245011300165520128800278592002801566650001301594650002001607650002301627650001001650650001801660650001101678650001801689653005401707653001801761653002401779653003601803653002301839700005801862700001701920700001901937773009001956856008502046852000902131655001202140IND60680725320221122082809.0200217e20200301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068072532DNAL7 a10.1016/j.energy.2019.1168082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJin, Rihui10aPerformance investigation of integrated concentrating solar air heater with curved Fresnel lens as the cover  aTo obtain a tracking-free, economical medium-high temperature solar air collector, this paper presents an integrated concentrating solar air heater (ICSAH), which is compounded of a curved Fresnel lens, a V-groove secondary reflector, and an absorber placed inside a glass tube flow channel. The optical simulation to the ICSAH was carried out, and the maximum optical efficiency is found 0.77. And its acceptance angles are 9.6° in north-south and 42.5° in east-west. The heat transfer was analyzed in detail and a calculation model was established. Two ICSAHs with different length have been set up and tested to investigate the thermal performance and validate the simulation results. The thermal efficiency is found more sensitive to incident angle α than γ. Besides, an entire daytime test on the fixed full-scale ICSAH shows that the outlet air temperature remains above 100 °C for 4.5 h and the maximum temperature differential reached to 108 °C at air flow rate of 8.1 kg/min. With 6.5 working hours per day, its daily efficiency achieves 0.53. The curve of normalized thermal efficiency illustrates that the heat loss rate of the full-scale ICSAH is about 1.758 W·m⁻² K⁻¹. Finally, a techno-economics comparison was made between the ICSAH and other CSAHs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair flow 3aair temperature 3aangle of incidence 3aglass 3aheat transfer 3amodels 3asolar heaters 0aIntegrated concentrating solar air heater (ICSAH) 0aTracking-free 0aCurved Fresnel lens 0aHeat transfer calculation model 0aOptical efficiency1 aZheng, Hongfei1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4002-62431 aMa, Xinglong1 aZhao, Yunsheng0 tEnergy.g2020 Mar. 01, v. 194 p.116808-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12436x0360-54427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2019.1168083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02969naa a2200829 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001200150245011000162506011700272506007600389520084900465592002801314506003701342650001701379650001001396650001701406650001001423650001701433650002601450650002201476653002101498653002301519653001401542653001701556653001001573653000901583653000801592653000901600653000901609653000901618653000801627653000801635653000901643653001101652653000801663653000801671653000801679653001201687653000701699653000901706653000901715653000801724653000801732653000801740653000801748653000901756653000901765653000701774653001001781653001101791653001201802653000701814653000701821653000801828653000701836653000701843653000701850653000701857653000801864653000801872653000801880700001601888700001801904773011101922856008502033852000902118655001202127IND60792470320221207080425.0220921e202212  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079247032DNAL7 a10.1016/j.engmic.2022.1000472doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGao, Qi10aRecent developments in the identification and biosynthesis of antitumor drugs derived from microorganisms  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aSecondary metabolites in microorganisms represent a resource for drug discovery and development.

Chlorophyll a and b content was found to be reduced under high temperature in both the genotypes, but, it was reduced more prominently in the susceptible genotype (K64R). Net photosynthetic rate was significantly reduced under high temperature in K64R but this reduction was relatively lower in case of DTPYC9F119. Stomatal conductance was increased under stress treatment in both the genotypes but the rate of increase was lower in tolerant one (DTPYC9F119). Activity of anti-oxidant enzymes (viz. catalase, peroxidase and superoxide dismutase) and their gene expression was increased in both the genotypes under heat-stress condition. Thus, the heat-stress tolerant genotype has evolved some strategies like modulation of anti-oxidant gene expression, lower transpiration rate, lower increase of internal CO₂ concentration which could make sustain a basic level of photosynthesis even under high temperature stress, etc. that may contribute to its tolerance trait.  aPublisher supplied data  aNPTC -3015cIndian Council of Agricultural Research0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aZea mays 3aantioxidant enzymes 3aantioxidant genes 3acarbon dioxide 3acatalase 3achlorophyll 3acorn 3aenzyme activity 3agene expression 3agenotype 3aheat stress 3aheat treatment 3aperoxidase 3aphotosynthesis 3astomatal conductance 3asuperoxide dismutase 3atemperature1 aDebnath, Suprokash1 aGautam, Anuradha1 aYadava, Pranjal0 tPhysiology and molecular biology of plants.g2020 May, v. 26, no. 5 p.921-929dSpringer IndiawJournal:22882x0971-58947nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12298-020-00801-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02587naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001300148245008100161300001600242520103900258592002801297650001601325650001301341650001501354650002801369650001201397650001601409650001201425650002201437650002501459650000901484650001201493650002001505700001401525700002301539700002101562700001701583700001901600700002301619700002701642700001701669700002301686700001601709700002501725700002101750700001801771700001501789700002501804773009001829856008201919990002302001852000902024655001202033IND60092820620221121062129.0141103e20120808xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009282062DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cmet.2012.07.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhu, Dan10aDual Role of VAMP8 in Regulating Insulin Exocytosis and Islet β Cell Growth  ap. 238-249.  aOptimal insulin secretion required to maintain glucose homeostasis is the summation of total pancreatic islet β cell mass and intrinsic secretory capacity of individual β cells, which are regulated by distinct mechanisms that could be amplified by glucagon-like-peptide-1 (GLP-1). Because of these actions of GLP-1 on islet β cells, GLP-1 has been deployed to treat diabetes. We employed SNARE protein VAMP8-null mice to demonstrate that VAMP8 mediates insulin granule recruitment to the plasma membrane, which partly accounts for GLP-1 potentiation of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. VAMP8-null mice also exhibited increased islet β cell mass from increased β cell mitosis, with β cell proliferative activity greatly amplified by GLP-1. Thus, despite the β cell exocytotic defect, VAMP8-null mice have an increased total insulin secretory capacity, which improved glucose homeostasis. We conclude that these VAMP8-mediated events partly underlie the therapeutic actions of GLP-1 on insulin secretion and β cell growth.  aPublisher supplied data 3acell growth 3adiabetes 3aexocytosis 3aglucagon-like peptide 1 3aglucose 3ahomeostasis 3ainsulin 3ainsulin secretion 3aislets of Langerhans 3amice 3amitosis 3aplasma membrane1 aZhang, Yi1 aLam, Patrick P.L.1 aDolai, Subhankar1 aLiu, Yunfeng1 aCai, Erica P.1 aSachs, Diana Choi,1 aSchroer, Stephanie A.1 aKang, Youhou1 aAllister, Emma M.1 aQin, Tairan1 aWheeler, Michael B.1 aWang, Cheng-Chun1 aHong, Wan-Jin1 aWoo, Minna1 aGaisano, Herbert Y.0 tCell metabolism.g2012 Aug. 8, v. 16, no. 2 p.238-249dElsevier Inc.x1550-41317nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cmet.2012.07.0013Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02516naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100001500154245006500169300001600234500001900250500002000269520118500289592002801474650002201502650001401524650001601538650001401554650002401568650001401592650000901606650001701615650001601632650001801648650002101666650000801687650001401695650001001709700001801719700001801737700001801755700001701773700001601790700001601806773011501822856008801937852000902025655001202034IND60734207120221120215401.0210415e200510  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073420712DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1469-8137.2005.01503.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWegel, Eva10aThree‐dimensional modelling of wheat endosperm development  ap. 253-262.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  a• We have developed methods, based on confocal microscopy and three‐dimensional (3D) modelling, for the analysis of complex tissues and individual nuclei. These methods were used to study the development of early wheat (Triticum aestivum) endosperm as a whole and of endosperm nuclei undergoing polyploidization. • Fixed sections of immature caryopses were either stained with SYTOX Green or used for fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) to visualize centromeres, telomeres and a rye chromosome arm substitution. Each section was imaged as a confocal image stack. By using Amira 3.0 for computer image processing, rendered models were produced of the whole endosperm and of individual nuclei. • We followed endosperm development up to the formation of a complete syncytium, which develops via a dorsal and a ventral plate of nuclei in the central cell. Modelling of nuclei showed that wheat chromosomes are not anchored to the nuclear membrane and become more randomly positioned in endoreduplicated nuclei. • This analysis produced a precise description of the positioning of nuclei throughout the developing endosperm and of chromosomal domains in single nuclei.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTriticum aestivum 3acaryopsis 3acentromeres 3acomputers 3aconfocal microscopy 3aendosperm 3afish 3afluorescence 3agiant cells 3ahybridization 3anuclear membrane 3arye 3atelomeres 3awheat1 aPilling, Emma1 aCalder, Grant1 aDrea, Sinéad1 aDoonan, John1 aDolan, Liam1 aShaw, Peter0 tnew phytologist.g2005 Oct., v. 168, no. 1 p.253-262dBlackwell Science LtdwJournal:jnl44665x0028-646X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1469-8137.2005.01503.x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03037naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094024002200130024001900152040001800171100002200189245006700211300001800278506007600296520167600372592002802048506003702076650000902113650002602122650001202148650001502160650002402175650002402199650001402223650000802237650001102245650001402256650001102270700001802281700002402299700002102323700002402344773013202368856008202500852000902582655001202591IND60693099020221207135352.0200504e202005  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069309902DNAL7 a10.1007/s12298-020-00795-12doi7 aPMC71965922pmcid7 a323770542pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIsmagilov, Rafael10aWays to reduce anti-nutritional substances in winter rye grain  ap. 1067-1073.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe purpose of this research was to establish the nature and extent of the influence of microwaves and extrusion on the content of anti-nutritional substances of winter rye grain. There was performed two-factor laboratory experiment with the treatment of winter rye grain by electromagnetic waves of super-high frequency (microwave) on a LG MS-2042G installation and one-factor laboratory experiment with grain treatment using a MKP-30-500 extruder. Depending on the power and duration of the microwave treatment, the content of water-soluble pentosans decreased by 0.04–0.44% and the kinematic viscosity of the aqueous extract—by 2.4 times. As a result of extrusion processing, the content of water-soluble pentosans in the winter rye grain decreased by 1.34 times, the kinematic viscosity of the aqueous extract—by 2.42 times. For all the years of the research, extrusion has led to a certain decrease in starch in winter rye grain. During a 3-year period the original grain of winter rye contained on average 59.9% of starch. After extrusion, the value of this indicator decreased by 2.0% amounting to 57.9%. During the extrusion process, starch is partially hydrolyzed to form intermediate carbohydrates-dextrins and then glucose. Our research has shown an increase in the content of soluble carbohydrates in extruded rye grain. During a 3-year period, the content of soluble carbohydrates in grain increased on average from 31.45 to 51.36%, i.e. by 19.91%. Treatment by microwaves and extrusion are effective ways to reduce the anti-nutritional substances of winter rye grain and significantly increase the proportion of rye grain in the diet of farm animals.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3adiet 3afarmed animal species 3aglucose 3ahydrolysis 3amicrowave radiation 3amicrowave treatment 3apentosans 3arye 3astarch 3aviscosity 3awinter1 aAyupov, Dayan1 aNurlygayanov, Razit1 aAhiyarova, Luise1 aAbdulloev, Valichon0 tPhysiology and molecular biology of plants.g2020 May, v. 26, no. 5 p.1067-1073dSpringer IndiawJournal:22882x0971-58947nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12298-020-00795-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01503naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245013900167300001800306520046100324592002800785650001300813650001100826650001900837650001400856650001900870650001700889650002100906700002100927700001600948773012300964856008101087852000901168655001201177IND60627418020221121051728.0190128e200809  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062741802DNAL7 a10.1007/s10853-008-2915-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHong, Cheng Hai10aComment on: Preparation, microstructure, and electrorheological property of nano-sized TiO2 particle materials doped with metal oxides  ap. 5702-5704.  aWe comment on the shear stresses of recently reported Na-doped, Zr-doped, Al-doped, and Ce-doped TiO₂-based electrorheological (ER) suspensions under applied electric strengths.

In this study, we propose immunization-specific MI training for immunization nurses. Together, MI-based training and interventions provide complementary approaches to existing strategies along the vaccination promotion continuum.Multiple pretest/posttest design with questionnaires self-administered before and after each training days (4 time points).We developed an in-person immunization-specific MI-training workshop for immunization nurses, held on two days three months apart, with 7 h of MI-training dispensed on day 1, and 4 h on day 2. The self-administered Motivational Interviewing Skills in Immunization (MISI) questionnaire was used at four time points (before and after each of the 2 training days) to evaluate three core aspects of participant MI training: (1) MI-knowledge acquisition; (2) MI-skills application and (3) self-rated self-confidence in applying MI knowledge and skills in vaccination clinical practice. Between November 2016 to December 2017, 34 immunization nurses enrolled in our MI-training workshops.The immunization-specific MI-training improved the three core areas evaluated in participants i.e. MI-knowledge acquisition, MI-skills application, and self-rated self-confidence in applying these in vaccination clinical practice.Our immunization-specific MI-training enabled immunization nurses to significantly improve MI knowledge, skills and self-confidence in applying MI in the clinic. These results, taken together with those on the MI-based intervention for parents that we previously reported, support the notion of proposing validated immunization-specific MI training for immunization nurses in order to curb parental VH.Immunization-specific MI-training would be easily amenable for the training of other health professionals in the field of immunization to help promote vaccination and curb parental VH.  aPublisher supplied data 3achildren 3ahospitals 3anurses 3aparents 3aquestionnaires 3avaccination 3avaccines 0aMotivational interview 0aTraining 0aSkills 0aVaccination promotion 0aNurse 0aHRQ 0aMI 0aMINT 0aMISI 0aMITI 0aSD1 aBergeron, Julie1 aGosselin, Virginie1 aFarrands, Anne1 aBaron, Geneviève0 tVaccine.g2019 May 06, v. 37, no. 20 p.2748-2756dElsevier LtdwJournal:6210x0264-410X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2019.03.0763Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01442naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100001700142245009600159300001400255520033300269592002800602650001200630650002500642650001200667650001400679650001600693650002100709650001900730651001400749653002400763653001700787653002200804653001500826653001200841653001600853773010000869856007800969852000901047655001201056IND60127435420221123003405.0151110e201212  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012743542DNAL7 a10.2985/026.018.01102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLong, Andrea10aOpuntia ventanensis (Cactaceae), a New Species from the Province of Buenos Aires, Argentina  ap. 79-84.  aOpuntia ventanensis A.

The pretreatment of LBs with PAA disrupted the lignin fractions, enhanced the dissolution of LB and led to a significant increase in the initial rate of the IL-HCl hydrolysis. The pretreatment of Bagasse with PAA prior to its 1-buthyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride ([Bmim][Cl])-HCl hydrolysis, led to an improvement in the cellulose conversion from 20% to 70% in 1.5h. Interestingly, the 1-buthyl-3-methylpyridium chloride ([Bmpy][Cl])-HCl hydrolysis of Bagasse gave a cellulose conversion greater than 80%, with or without the PAA pretreatment. For LB derived from seaweed waste, the cellulose conversion reached 98% in 1h. The strong hydrolysis power of [Bmpy][Cl] was attributed to its ability to transform cellulose I to II, and lowering the degree of polymerization of cellulose.  aPublisher supplied data 3abagasse 3abiomass 3acellulose 3ahydrolysis 3aionic liquids 3alignin 3alignocellulose 3amacroalgae 3amethodology 3aperacetic acid 3apolymerization 3asaccharification 3awastes 0aIonic liquid 0aHydrolysis 0aLignocellulosic biomass 0aPeracetic acid1 aGoto, Masahiro1 aKamiya, Noriho0 tBioresource technology.g2016 Aug., v. 214 p.487-495dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46263x0960-85247nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2016.04.1213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02625naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002100148245013700169300001600306520107700322592002801399650001001427650000901437650002701446650002501473650003001498650001701528700001901545700002001564700002101584700001901605700002101624700001801645700001901663700001901682700002101701700002001722700001901742700002001761700002501781700001801806700002001824700002201844700002001866700001701886773009001903856008201993990002302075852000902098655001202107IND60092820920221121062234.0141103e20120808xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009282092DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cmet.2012.06.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKim, Soung Jung10aCRIF1 Is Essential for the Synthesis and Insertion of Oxidative Phosphorylation Polypeptides in the Mammalian Mitochondrial Membrane  ap. 274-283.  aAlthough substantial progress has been made in understanding the mechanisms underlying the expression of mtDNA-encoded polypeptides, the regulatory factors involved in mitoribosome-mediated synthesis and simultaneous insertion of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) polypeptides into the inner membrane of mitochondria are still unclear. In the present study, disruption of the mouse Crif1 gene, which encodes a mitochondrial protein, resulted in a profound deficiency in OXPHOS caused by the disappearance of OXPHOS subunits and complexes in vivo. CRIF1 was associated with large mitoribosomal subunits that were located close to the polypeptide exit tunnel, and the elimination of CRIF1 led to both aberrant synthesis and defective insertion of mtDNA-encoded nascent OXPHOS polypeptides into the inner membrane. CRIF1 interacted with nascent OXPHOS polypeptides and molecular chaperones, e.g., Tid1. Taken together, these results suggest that CRIF1 plays a critical role in the integration of OXPHOS polypeptides into the mitochondrial membrane in mammals.  aPublisher supplied data 3agenes 3amice 3amitochondrial membrane 3amolecular chaperones 3aoxidative phosphorylation 3apolypeptides1 aKwon, Min-chul1 aRyu, Min Jeong1 aChung, Hyo Kyun1 aTadi, Surendar1 aKim, Yong Kyung1 aMan Kim, Jin1 aLee, Sang Hee1 aPark, Ji Hoon,1 aKweon, Gi Ryang1 aRyu, Seung-Wook1 aJo, Young Suk1 aYi, Chʻŏr-ho,1 aHatakeyama, Hideyuki1 aGoto, Yu-ichi1 aYim, Yong-Hyeon1 aChung, Jongkyeong1 aKong, Young-Yun1 aShong, Minho0 tCell metabolism.g2012 Aug. 8, v. 16, no. 2 p.274-283dElsevier Inc.x1550-41317nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cmet.2012.06.0123Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle01340naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002900148245006300177300001600240520035900256592002800615650002300643650001000666650003100676650001600707650001500723650001900738650002600757700002700783773009000810856008200900990002300982852000901005655001201014IND60092821120221120121647.0141103e20120808xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009282112DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cmet.2012.07.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHayes, J.

These lipid mediators play important roles in various physiological and pathological processes. The quantitative determination of PUFA metabolites seems necessary for disease research and for developing biomarkers. However, there is a paucity of analytical methods for the quantification of ω-6 and ω-3 PUFA metabolites—the specialized pro-resolving mediators (SPMs) present in the human urine. We developed a method for the quantification of ω-6 and ω-3 PUFA metabolites present in human urine using ultra-performance liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC/MS/MS). The developed method shows good linearity, with a correlation coefficient >0.99 for all of the analytes. The validation results indicate that our method is adequately reliable, accurate, and precise. The method was successfully used to examine urine samples obtained from 43 healthy volunteers. We could identify 20 PUFA metabolites, and this is the first report of the quantitative determination of RvD1, 17(R)-RvD1, 11-dehydro thromboxane B₃, RvE2, and 5(S)-HETE in human urine. The urinary 8-iso PGF₂αand PGE₂levels were significantly higher in the men smokers than in the men nonsmokers (p < 0.05). In this study, we developed an accurate, precise, and novel analytical method for estimating the ω-6 and ω-3 PUFA metabolites, and this is the first report that the SPMs derived from EPA and DHA are present in human urine.  aPublisher supplied data 3aarachidonic acid 3abioactive properties 3abiomarkers 3acorrelation 3adocosahexaenoic acid 3aeicosapentaenoic acid 3ahumans 3aleukotrienes 3amen 3ametabolites 3aprostaglandins 3aquantitative analysis 3atandem mass spectrometry 3athromboxanes 3aultra-performance liquid chromatography 3aurine1 aFukuda, Hayato1 aShiida, Narumi1 aTanaka, Nobuaki1 aFurugen, Ayako1 aOgura, Jiro1 aShuto, Satoshi1 aMano, Nariyasu1 aYamaguchi, Hiroaki0 tAnalytical and bioanalytical chemistry.g2015 Feb., v. 407, no. 6 p.1625-1639dSpringer-Verlagx1618-26427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00216-014-8412-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03698naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100001900154245015800173300001500331520221400346592002802560650001702588650002502605650002502630650001502655650001502670650001302685650001802698650002302716650001902739650001702758651001302775653003102788653001602819653003202835653002502867653002502892700002402917700001702941700003202958700005802990773009403048856008903142852000903231655001203240IND60635863020221119234008.0220614e201906  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063586302DNAL7 a10.1016/j.landusepol.2019.03.0482doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aUrbieta, Pablo12aA land-cover based urban dispersion indicator suitable for highly dispersed, discontinuously artificialized territories: The case of continental Portugal  ap. 92-103.  aLand-cover based indicators assessing the effect of the magnitude and spatial patterns of the artificialization process, including urban sprawl, barely consider the impact of the discontinuous spatial distribution of the artificialized built-up areas. In this study, we propose a new urban dispersion indicator, which incorporates the characteristic dynamics of the discontinuous urban artificial land cover class, characteristic of scarcely populated and highly dispersed territories, such as is the case of Continental Portugal. The indicator is based on the premise that the more built-up area, the higher the uptake of constructed area in a discontinuous pattern and the more dispersed this built-up area, the lower urban sustainability of the territory. Given that the minimum cartographic unit in Corine Land Cover (25 ha) is typically higher than most of the discontinuous urban patches in these territories, in this research we used national land use data from Portugal with a minimum cartographic unit of 1 ha. The values calculated for this indicator show that the level of urban dispersion of continental Portugal increased by 14.2% in the 1990–2007 period. The artificialization process was geographically heterogeneous with notable differences being observed between regions and also along the urban to rural and coastal to hinterland gradients. The temporal changes in the indicator allowed the identification of distinct artificialization patterns: diffusion, sprinkling and coalescence, which were interpreted on the basis of the evolution of the artificialization process. The values derived from this indicator were related with two main environmental impacts associated with the artificialization process: the loss of arable land and the decrease in the carbon sequestration capacity of the territory. The proposed indicator can be a useful tool to monitor and evaluate the impacts of different public policies with a direct impact on land artificialization, as well as on the territorial and urban planning processes, whether at the national, regional or municipal level, allowing more detailed and consistent spatial analyses and diagnoses of urban sustainability to be undertaken.  aPublisher supplied data 3aarable soils 3acarbon sequestration 3aenvironmental impact 3ahinterland 3aland cover 3aland use 3apublic policy 3atemporal variation 3aurban planning 3aurbanization 3aPortugal 0aArtificialization patterns 0aLow-density 0aHighly-dispersed population 0aDispersion indicator 0aContinental Portugal1 aFernández, Emilio,1 aRamos, Luis,1 aMéndez Martínez, Gonzalo,1 aBento, Ricardo1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4469-385X0 tLand use policy.g2019 June, v. 85 p.92-103dElsevier LtdwJournal:12412x0264-83777nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.landusepol.2019.03.0483Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03309naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005500148245008800203300001600291520169900307592002802006596005902034596005902093596007502152596008402227650001402311650001702325650002002342650003102362650001602393650002202409650001202431650002902443700005702472700005402529700005902583700005602642773010902698856008302807852000902890655001202899IND60770653420221117232546.0220320e202204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077065342DNAL7 a10.1007/s10528-021-10127-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYao, Baojin1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7542-158510aComparison of Gene Expression Patterns in Articular Cartilage and Xiphoid Cartilage  ap. 676-706.  aCartilage is a resilient and smooth connective tissue that is found throughout the body. Among the three major types of cartilage, namely hyaline cartilage, elastic cartilage, and fibrocartilage, hyaline cartilage is the most widespread type of cartilage predominantly located in the joint surfaces (articular cartilage, AC). It remains a huge challenge for orthopedic surgeons to deal with AC damage since it has limited capacity for self-repair. Xiphoid cartilage (XC) is a vestigial cartilage located in the distal end of the sternum. XC-derived chondrocytes exhibit strong chondrogenic differentiation capacity. Thus, XC could become a potential donor site of chondrocytes for cartilage repair and regeneration. However, the underlying gene expression patterns between AC and XC are still largely unknown. In the present study, we used state-of-the-art RNA-seq technology combined with validation method to investigate the gene expression patterns between AC and XC, and identified a series of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) involved in chondrocyte commitment and differentiation including growth factors, transcription factors, and extracellular matrices. We demonstrated that the majority of significantly up-regulated DEGs (XC vs. AC) in XC were involved in regulating cartilage regeneration and repair, whereas the majority of significantly up-regulated DEGs (XC vs. AC) in AC were involved in regulating chondrocyte differentiation and maturation. This study has increased our knowledge of transcriptional networks in hyaline cartilage and elastic cartilage. It also supports the use of XC-derived chondrocytes as a potential cell resource for cartilage regeneration and repair.  aPublisher supplied data  a81702136cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a81973887cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a2018YFC1706605cNational Key Research and Development Program of China  a20180623048TCcTCM Clinical Research Center for Bone diseases of Jilin Province 3acartilage 3achondrocytes 3agene expression 3agene expression regulation 3aorthopedics 3asequence analysis 3asternum 3atranscription (genetics)1 aZhou, Zhenwei1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3989-34351 aZhang, Mei1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9096-38521 aLeng, Xiangyang1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5278-40011 aZhao, Daqing1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5678-74100 tBiochemical genetics.g2022 Apr., v. 60, no. 2 p.676-706dSpringer USwJournal:jnl44655x0006-29287nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10528-021-10127-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03452naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004400094040001800138100002600156245006000182300001400242506002800256520203900284592002802323506003702351650001202388650001002400650001002410650001202420650001802432650001302450650001502463650000902478650001502487653001802502653003002520653002302550653001402573653000902587653001602596653001502612653001502627700002002642700002302662700002402685773016102709856009102870852000902961655001202970IND60739572520221207131810.0190112e201812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073957252DNAL7 a10.22314/2073-7599-2018-12-6-31-372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMikheyev, Vladimir V.10aMechanization of Root Crop Seed Production Technologies  ap. 31-37.  aResource is Open Access  aThe sugar beet seed production is currently employing a non-planting-and-transplant technology with the use of steklings. Planting units of the machines available on the market feature a number of drawbacks: low productivity, possible injuring of root crops, and increased labor intensity of operators. (Research purpose) To develop a universal design and parameters of an increased-productivity unit for planting steklings of sugar beet and other root crops. (Materials and methods) The design scheme and type of a planting unit have been chosen according to the requirements of applicability and versatility. Its preferred design parameters have been calculated as well. A prototype machine with a universal planting unit in the form of a cellular disk has been developed and manufactured in test production. (Results and discussion) The conducted field experiments proved the versatility of a planting machine with a disc-type unit used for planting root crops, including dimensional characteristics corresponding to those of steklings. The authors have found that when replacing a disk with a different number of cells of different sizes, the machine is suitable for planting a number of similar crops. A removable disk with 12-16 cells has been installed, with its angular speed decreased to 0.393-1.180 radian per second, which is lower as compared to the existing machines. Satisfactory agrotechnical tolerances have been provided for carrot planting in the soil at a depth of 12 cm, a step of 30 cm, and a deviation from the vertical of 110. The intensity of root crop laying in the cells of a seeding disk has been increased to 1-3 pcs. per second. (Conclusions) It has been found that the machine and the planting unit can increase the working speed up to 1.0 meter per second and reduce the labor intensity of operators to the level of safety requirements. The use of universal machines in the breeding and seed production of root crops will reduce the range of the applied machines and operating costs of farm enterprises.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3acarrots 3afarms 3alabor 3amarkets 3amechanization 3aplanting 3aprototypes 3asoil 3asugar beet 0amechanization 0aroot crop seed production 0aroot crop planting 0asteckling 0atype 0asowing unit 0aroot crops 0asugar beet1 aEremin, Petr A.1 aZernov, Vitaliy N.1 aPetukhov, Sergey N.0 tSelʹskohozâjstvennye mašiny i tehnologii.g2018 Dec., v. 12, no. 6 p.31-37dFederal Scientific Agroengineering Centre VIMwJournal:27913x2618-67487nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.22314/2073-7599-2018-12-6-31-373Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02531naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245014000169520119400309592002801503650000901531650002501540650001101565650002701576650002201603650001101625650001601636650000901652651001001661653002301671653002201694653001501716653001601731653004501747700002701792700006301819700005501882773009001937856008502027852000902112655001202121IND60680726320221122065553.0200217e20200301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068072632DNAL7 a10.1016/j.energy.2019.1168362doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aUr Rahman, Zia12aA disaggregated-level analysis of the relationship among energy production, energy consumption and economic growth: Evidence from China  aThe purpose of this study is to explore the relationship between energy production, energy consumption, and gross domestic product (GDP) growth in China for the period 1981–2016 (at the disaggregate level). The results of the Hatemi-J cointegration and structural-break tests supported long-term co-integration in the consumption and production of coal, oil, and natural gas. Based on the three models (coal, oil, and natural gas) of energy production and consumption, the fully-modified least square (FMOLS) method results confirmed the presence of long-term positive impact of the consumption and production of coal, oil, and natural gas on GDP growth. The CCR model estimations for robustness were found to be consistent with the FMLOS estimations. The vector error correction mechanism (VECM) based Granger-causality tests identified a one-way causality run from coal production and coal consumption to GDP growth; from GDP growth to gas consumption (supporting conservation hypothesis); from natural gas production to natural gas consumption; and from oil production and oil consumption to GDP growth. The paper draws important policy implications for theory, research and practice.  aPublisher supplied data 3acoal 3aeconomic development 3aenergy 3agross domestic product 3aissues and policy 3amodels 3anatural gas 3aoils 3aChina 0aEnergy consumption 0aEnergy production 0aGDP growth 0aFMOLS model 0aVector error correction mechanism (VECM)1 aIqbal Khattak, Shoukat1 aAḥmad, Manẓūr,1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1152-20961 aKhan, Anwar1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6480-39510 tEnergy.g2020 Mar. 01, v. 194 p.116836-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12436x0360-54427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2019.1168363Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03161naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245015400165300001800319520156600337592002801903650001101931650001801942650001401960650001401974650002301988650003802011650001402049650000902063650001502072650002602087650001302113650001102126650002002137650002602157650001202183650001702195700001802212700002002230700001902250700002702269700002302296700001902319700002102338700002902359700001902388700001802407773011602425856008102541852000902622655001202631IND60121241720221119155736.0150301e201502  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012124172DNAL7 a10.1007/s00216-014-8418-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDehus, Oliver10aDevelopment and in-house validation of an allergen-specific ELISA for quantification of Bet v 4 in diagnostic and therapeutic birch allergen products  ap. 1673-1683.  aBirch (Betula) pollen is a major cause of allergy in northern and central Europe. The allergenic potency of products for diagnosis and therapy of birch pollen allergy is adjusted nearly exclusively to the major birch pollen allergen Bet v 1. Although every fifth patient is additionally sensitized to Bet v 4, both content and variability of this minor allergen in birch allergen products remain unclear due to a lack of simple and cost-effective quantitative methods. This study aimed to develop and in-house validate the first Bet v 4-specific sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Based on a murine monoclonal antibody in combination with a polyclonal rabbit antiserum, the ELISA proved to be highly sensitive, with a lower limit of quantification of 30 pg/ml Bet v 4. After confirmation of satisfactory accuracy, reproducibility, and robustness, the ELISA was utilized to quantify Bet v 4 in 30 authorized birch allergen products. The allergen was detected in all samples tested, ranging from 0.2 to 4.4 μg/ml. No significant correlation of Bet v 4 was found with the respective amount of Bet v 1. In contrast to Bet v 1, also no correlation of Bet v 4 with total protein content or total allergenic activity could be observed. Thus, it seems presently unfeasible to base birch allergen product standardization additionally on Bet v 4. In light of these results, the continuous monitoring of Bet v 4 in birch allergen products with the presented ELISA will provide a basis for the understanding of the clinical relevance of minor allergens.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBetula 3aallergenicity 3aallergens 3aantiserum 3acost effectiveness 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3ahay fever 3amice 3amonitoring 3amonoclonal antibodies 3apatients 3apollen 3aprotein content 3aquantitative analysis 3arabbits 3atherapeutics1 aZimmer, Julia1 aDöring, Sascha1 aFührer, Frank1 aHanschmann, Kay-Martin1 aHolzhauser, Thomas1 aNeske, Florian1 aStrecker, Daniel1 aTrösemeier, Jan-Hendrik1 aVieths, Stefan1 aKaul, Susanne0 tAnalytical and bioanalytical chemistry.g2015 Feb., v. 407, no. 6 p.1673-1683dSpringer-Verlagx1618-26427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00216-014-8418-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02407naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100002900142245009900171300002000270520117200290592002801462650001601490650001201506650001701518650001401535650001401549650002301563650001301586650001301599700002201612700002001634700002301654700002701677700002401704700005801728773015001786856007601936852000902012655001202021IND60750518720220219000000.0210915e20210903xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075051872DNAL7 a10.1021/jacs.1c070672doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchwengers, Sebastian A.10aUnified Approach to Imidodiphosphate-Type Brønsted Acids with Tunable Confinement and Acidity  ap. 14835-14844.  aWe have designed and realized an efficient and operationally simple single-flask synthesis of imidodiphosphate-based Brønsted acids. The methodology proceeds via consecutive chloride substitutions of hexachlorobisphosphazonium salts, providing rapid access to imidodiphosphates (IDP), iminoimidodiphosphates (iIDP), and imidodiphosphorimidates (IDPi). These privileged acid catalysts feature a broad acidity range (pKₐ from ∼11 to <2 in MeCN) and a readily tunable confined active site. Our approach enables access to previously elusive catalyst scaffolds with particularly high structural confinement, one of which catalyzes the first highly enantioselective (>95:5 er) sulfoxidation of methyl n-propyl sulfide. Furthermore, the methodology delivers a novel, rationally designed super acidic catalyst motif, imidodiphosphorbis(iminosulfonylimino)imidate (IDPii), the extreme reactivity of which exceeds commonly employed super-Brønsted acids, such as trifluoromethanesulfonic acid. The unique reactivity of one such IDPii catalyst has been demonstrated in the first α-methylation of a silyl ketene acetal with methanol as the electrophilic alkylating reagent.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLewis acids 3aacidity 3aactive sites 3acatalysts 3achlorides 3aenantioselectivity 3amethanol 3asulfides1 aDe, Chandra Kanta1 aGrossmann, Oleg1 aGrimm, Joyce A.

To meet the assumptions of the linear model, such data are usually transformed or non-parametric methods are used if the transformed data still violate the assumptions. Generalized linear models (GLMs) allow to directly model such data, without the need for transformation. Here, we compare the performance of two parametric methods, i.e., (1) the linear model (assuming normality of transformed data), (2) GLMs (assuming a Poisson, negative binomial, or binomially distributed response), and (3) non-parametric methods. We simulated typical data mimicking low replicated ecotoxicological experiments of two common data types (counts and proportions from counts). We compared the performance of the different methods in terms of statistical power and Type I error for detecting a general treatment effect and determining the lowest observed effect concentration (LOEC). In addition, we outlined differences on a real-world mesocosm data set. For count data, we found that the quasi-Poisson model yielded the highest power. The negative binomial GLM resulted in increased Type I errors, which could be fixed using the parametric bootstrap. For proportions, binomial GLMs performed better than the linear model, except to determine LOEC at extremely low sample sizes. The compared non-parametric methods had generally lower power. We recommend that counts in one-factorial experiments should be analyzed using quasi-Poisson models and proportions from counts by binomial GLMs. These methods should become standard in ecotoxicology.  aPublisher supplied data 3adata collection 3aecotoxicology 3alinear models1 aSchäfer, Ralf B.0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research international.g2015 Sept., v. 22, no. 18 p.13990-13999dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx0944-13447nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-015-4579-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03333naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001700139245006100156300001800217500002000235520196800255592002802223650001202251650001202263650001502275650001202290650002002302650001802322650001202340650001402352650001902366650001602385650001702401650001202418650002602430650001302456650001902469650001902488650002302507650002502530651001302555700002202568700001702590700001802607773013202625856007302757852000902830655001202839IND60587600320221118102020.0180102e201110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058760032DNAL7 a10.1890/10-1168.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlencar, Ane10aTemporal variability of forest fires in eastern Amazonia  ap. 2397-2412.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aWidespread occurrence of fires in Amazonian forests is known to be associated with extreme droughts, but historical data on the location and extent of forest fires are fundamental to determining the degree to which climate conditions and droughts have affected fire occurrence in the region. We used remote sensing to derive a 23‐year time series of annual landscape‐level burn scars in a fragmented forest of the eastern Amazon. Our burn scar data set is based on a new routine developed for the Carnegie Landsat Analysis System (CLAS), called CLAS‐BURN, to calculate a physically based burn scar index (BSI) with an overall accuracy of 93% (Kappa coefficient 0.84). This index uses sub‐pixel cover fractions of photosynthetic vegetation, non‐photosynthetic vegetation, and shade/burn scar spectral end members. From 23 consecutive Landsat images processed with the CLAS‐BURN algorithm, we quantified fire frequencies, the variation in fire return intervals, and rates of conversion of burned forest to other land uses in a 32 400 km² area. From 1983 to 2007, 15% of the forest burned; 38% of these burned forests were subsequently deforested, representing 19% of the area cleared during the period of observation. While 72% of the fire‐affected forest burned only once during the 23‐year study period, 20% burned twice, 6% burned three times, and 2% burned four or more times, with the maximum of seven times. These frequencies suggest that the current fire return interval is 5–11 times more frequent than the estimated natural fire regime. Our results also quantify the substantial influence of climate and extreme droughts caused by a strong El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) on the extent and likelihood of returning forest fires mainly in fragmented landscapes. These results are an important indication of the role of future warmer climate and deforestation in enhancing emissions from more frequently burned forests in the Amazon.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEl Nino 3aLandsat 3aalgorithms 3aclimate 3adata collection 3adeforestation 3adrought 3aemissions 3afire frequency 3afire regime 3aforest fires 3aforests 3ahabitat fragmentation 3aland use 3aphotosynthesis 3aremote sensing 3atemporal variation 3atime series analysis 3aAmazonia1 aAsner, Gregory P.1 aKnapp, David1 aZarin, Daniel0 tEcological applications.g2011 Oct., v. 21, no. 7 p.2397-2412dEcological Society of AmericawJournal:jnl47193x1051-07617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1890/10-1168.13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01227naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001400140245014200154300001800296520024600314592002800560650001700588650002300605650001700628650001700645700001200662700001600674700001800690773013400708856007400842852000900916655001200925IND60660188120221120030355.0190823e20140429xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066018812DNAL7 a10.1039/c4cc01821d2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGao, Chao13aAn AIE active monoimidazolium skeleton: high selectivity and fluorescence turn-on for H₂PO₄⁻ in acetonitrile and ClO₄⁻ in water  ap. 5623-5625.  aWe disclose herein a monoimidazolium skeleton 1 with an aggregation-induced emission (AIE) characteristic.

The movement of the filament lags behind the constantly changing target depth owing to (a) the time taken for the filament to respond to the irradiance by changing its density and (b) the time it takes to move by sinking down or floating up through the water column. • The model simulates the stratification depth over a 5‐month period of the summer from the continuous measurements of irradiance and weekly measurements of light attenuation and temperature, without any further adjustment over the period. Models using filaments of the size observed in Lake Zürich explain several details of the observed depth changes: smaller planktonic cyanobacteria (e.g. Limnothrix sp.) are unable to migrate fast enough and larger ones (e.g. Anabaena spp.) will overshoot and become entrained in the epilimnion. • The model can be used to simulate recruitment of Planktothrix filaments from different depths after vernal stratification. Recruitment of filaments from depths down to 45 m will contribute to the metalimnetic population increase in early July.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAnabaena 3aPlanktothrix rubescens 3acomputer simulation 3alakes 3alight intensity 3amodels 3aplankton 3apopulation growth 3asummer 3atemperature0 tnew phytologist.g2005 Nov., v. 168, no. 2 p.365-376dBlackwell Science LtdwJournal:jnl44665x0028-646X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1469-8137.2005.01508.x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01816naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100001600112245011700128300001800245500001900263520066100282592002800943650002100971650001200992650001801004650002001022650001401042650001401056650001201070650001701082650001501099650001301114650001701127650001601144653001001160653001101170653002701181700001801208700001701226773015401243852000901397655001201406IND60723771120221121153732.0210117e201509  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072377112DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVerma, S.K.10aStudies on the Effect of Post Harvest Treatments on Storage of Mango (Mangifera indica L.)

This work studied the biodegradation of 1,2-dichloroethane (1,2-DCA) in a lab-scale BES, inoculated with a municipal activated sludge and operated under a range of conditions, spanning from oxidative to reductive, both in the presence and in the absence of the humic acid analogue anthraquinone-2,6-disulfonate (AQDS) as a redox mediator. The results showed stable dechlorination of 1,2-DCA to ethene (up to 65±5μmol/Ld), when the BES was operated at a set potential of −300mV vs. SHE, in the presence of AQDS. Sustained filled-and-draw operation resulted in the enrichment of Dehalococcoides mccartyi. The results of this work provide new insights into the applicability of BES for groundwater remediation and the potential interaction between biogeochemistry and 1,2-DCA in humics-rich contaminated aquifers.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDehalococcoides mccartyi 3aactivated sludge 3aaquifers 3abiodegradation 3abioelectrochemistry 3adechlorination 3aethylene 3aethylene dichloride 3agroundwater 3ahumic acids 3aremediation 0aActivated sludge 0a1,2-Dichloroethane 0aBioelectrochemical systems 0aRedox mediator 0aAnthraquinone-2,6-disulfonate (AQDS) 0aDehalococcoides mccartyi1 aRossetti, Simona1 aDanko, Anthony S.1 aNouws, Henri1 aAulenta, Federico1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6819-79440 tBioresource technology.g2016 Aug., v. 214 p.426-431dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46263x0960-85247nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2016.04.1293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02167naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100001600142245009300158300002000251520091400271592002801185650001601213650001401229650002901243650001101272650001201283650001401295650000901309700001401318700002401332700002301356700006001379700006201439700005801501773014901559856007601708852000901784655001201793IND60750519020221120024113.0210915e20210831xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075051902DNAL7 a10.1021/jacs.1c071392doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJu, Luchuan10aReactivity of (bi-Oxazoline)organonickel Complexes and Revision of a Catalytic Mechanism  ap. 14458-14463.  aBi-Oxazoline (biOx) has emerged as an effective ligand framework for promoting nickel-catalyzed cross-coupling, cross-electrophile coupling, and photoredox-nickel dual catalytic reactions. This report fills the knowledge gap of the organometallic reactivity of (biOx)Ni complexes, including catalyst reduction, oxidative electrophile activation, radical capture, and reductive elimination. The biOx ligand displays no redox activity in (biOx)Ni(I) complexes, in contrast to other chelating imine and oxazoline ligands. The lack of ligand redox activity results in more negative reduction potentials of (biOx)Ni(II) complexes and accounts for the inability of zinc and manganese to reduce (biOx)Ni(II) species. On the basis of these results, we revise the formerly proposed “sequential reduction” mechanism of a (biOx)Ni-catalyzed cross-electrophile coupling reaction by excluding catalyst reduction steps.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLewis acids 3acatalysts 3across-coupling reactions 3aimines 3aligands 3amanganese 3azinc1 aLin, Qiao1 aLiBretto, Nicole J.1 aWagner, Clifton L.1 aHu, Chunhua Tony1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8172-22021 aMiller, Jeffrey T.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6269-06201 aDiao, Tianning1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3916-83720 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2021 Aug. 31, v. 143, no. 36 p.14458-14463dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19166x1520-51267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jacs.1c071393Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02447naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002900152245010200181500002200283500002200305520123700327592002801564650001401592650001201606650001001618650001901628650001501647650000701662650001601669653002001685653003201705700002901737700007101766700003001837773011101867856008601978852000902064655001202073IND60610084420221121095905.0180825s2018    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061008442DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2018.07.0282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMoreira, Juliana Botelho10aDevelopment of pH indicator from PLA/PEO ultrafine fibers containing pigment of microalgae origin  aPre-press version  aPre-press version  aPhycocyanin is a pigment of intense blue color, constituting the biomass of microalga such as Spirulina. This pigment is sensitive to pH and this instability results in color change. Thus, phycocyanin fading may become interesting for application in intelligent packaging. The objective of the study was to develop PLA/PEO ultrafine fibers containing phycocyanin to be used as pH indicators membranes for food packaging. The ultrafine fibers were formed by electrospinning process. The average diameter of 1318 nm was obtained for PLA/PEO ultrafine fibers with 2% (w·v⁻¹) of phycocyanin and 921 nm for those developed with 3% (w·v⁻¹) of the dye. PLA/PEO ultrafine fibers with 3% (w·v⁻¹) of the phycocyanin presented the best responses regarding the perception of color change (ΔE). With the highest thickness (68.7 μm) of the ultrafine fibers developed from 3% (w·v⁻¹) of phycocyanin, the ΔE value found was 18.85 to the variation of pH 3 to 4 and for variation from pH 5 to 6 the value of ΔE was 18.66. Thus, the use of PLA/PEO ultrafine fibers containing phycocyanin as pH indicator is an innovative application for intelligent packaging, since the color of pigment changes depending on pH variation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSpirulina 3abiomass 3acolor 3afood packaging 3amicroalgae 3apH 3aphycocyanin 0aElectrospinning 0aFood packaging, Phycocyanin1 aTerra, Ana Luiza Machado1 aCosta, Jorge Alberto Vieira1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8042-76421 aMorais, Michele Greque de0 tInternational journal of biological macromolecules.g2018, dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12340x0141-81307nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2018.07.0283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle10010naa a2200733 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002200094024002200116024001900138040001800157100001700175245015200192300001400344520781100358592002808169650002208197650002208219650001408241650001208255650001508267650001408282650001208296650001908308650002208327650002408349650001208373650001708385650001108402650001008413650002108423650001108444650002208455650002108477650001608498650002108514650001908535650002108554650001908575650001508594650002308609650001708632650002208649650002708671650001108698650001508709650001808724650001608742650002008758650001408778650001208792650001608804700002508820700002708845700001808872700002308890773014908913856006809062856010209130990002309232852000909255655001209264IND60643366020221119083407.0190510e20120720xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064336602DNAL7 a10.3791/39912doi7 aPMC34764192pmcid7 a228473882pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLovy, Alenka12aA faster, high resolution, mtpa-gfp-based mitochondrial fusion assay acquiring kinetic data of multiple cells in parallel using confocal microscopy  ap. e3991.  aMitochondrial fusion plays an essential role in mitochondrial calcium homeostasis, bioenergetics, autophagy and quality control. Fusion is quantified in living cells by photo-conversion of matrix targeted photoactivatable GFP (mtPAGFP) in a subset of mitochondria. The rate at which the photoconverted molecules equilibrate across the entire mitochondrial population is used as a measure of fusion activity. Thus far measurements were performed using a single cell time lapse approach, quantifying the equilibration in one cell over an hour. Here, we scale up and automate a previously published live cell method based on using mtPAGFP and a low concentration of TMRE (15 nm). This method involves photoactivating a small portion of the mitochondrial network, collecting highly resolved stacks of confocal sections every 15 min for 1 hour, and quantifying the change in signal intensity. Depending on several factors such as ease of finding PAGFP expressing cells, and the signal of the photoactivated regions, it is possible to collect around 10 cells within the 15 min intervals. This provides a significant improvement in the time efficiency of this assay while maintaining the highly resolved subcellular quantification as well as the kinetic parameters necessary to capture the detail of mitochondrial behavior in its native cytoarchitectural environment. Mitochondrial dynamics play a role in many cellular processes including respiration, calcium regulation, and apoptosis1,2,3,13. The structure of the mitochondrial network affects the function of mitochondria, and the way they interact with the rest of the cell. Undergoing constant division and fusion, mitochondrial networks attain various shapes ranging from highly fused networks, to being more fragmented. Interestingly, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Charcot Marie Tooth 2A, and dominant optic atrophy have been correlated with altered mitochondrial morphology, namely fragmented networks4,10,13. Often times, upon fragmentation, mitochondria become depolarized, and upon accumulation this leads to impaired cell function18. Mitochondrial fission has been shown to signal a cell to progress toward apoptosis. It can also provide a mechanism by which to separate depolarized and inactive mitochondria to keep the bulk of the network robust14. Fusion of mitochondria, on the other hand, leads to sharing of matrix proteins, solutes, mtDNA and the electrochemical gradient, and also seems to prevent progression to apoptosis9. How fission and fusion of mitochondria affects cell homeostasis and ultimately the functioning of the organism needs further understanding, and therefore the continuous development and optimization of how to gather information on these phenomena is necessary. Existing mitochondrial fusion assays have revealed various insights into mitochondrial physiology, each having its own advantages. The hybrid PEG fusion assay7, mixes two populations of differently labeled cells (mtRFP and mtYFP), and analyzes the amount of mixing and colocalization of fluorophores in fused, multinucleated, cells. Although this method has yielded valuable information, not all cell types can fuse, and the conditions under which fusion is stimulated involves the use of toxic drugs that likely affect the normal fusion process. More recently, a cell free technique has been devised, using isolated mitochondria to observe fusion events based on a luciferase assay1,5. Two human cell lines are targeted with either the amino or a carboxy terminal part of Renilla luciferase along with a leucine zipper to ensure dimerization upon mixing. Mitochondria are isolated from each cell line, and fused. The fusion reaction can occur without the cytosol under physiological conditions in the presence of energy, appropriate temperature and inner mitochondrial membrane potential. Interestingly, the cytosol was found to modulate the extent of fusion, demonstrating that cell signaling regulates the fusion process 4,5. This assay will be very useful for high throughput screening to identify components of the fusion machinery and also pharmacological compounds that may affect mitochondrial dynamics. However, more detailed whole cell mitochondrial assays will be needed to complement this in vitro assay to observe these events within a cellular environment. A technique for monitoring whole-cell mitochondrial dynamics has been in use for some time and is based on a mitochondrially-targeted photoactivatable GFP (mtPAGFP)6,11. Upon expression of the mtPAGFP, a small portion of the mitochondrial network is photoactivated (10-20%), and the spread of the signal to the rest of the mitochondrial network is recorded every 15 minutes for 1 hour using time lapse confocal imaging. Each fusion event leads to a dilution of signal intensity, enabling quantification of the fusion rate. Although fusion and fission are continuously occurring in cells, this technique only monitors fusion as fission does not lead to a dilution of the PAGFP signal6. Co-labeling with low levels of TMRE (7-15 nM in INS1 cells) allows quantification of the membrane potential of mitochondria. When mitochondria are hyperpolarized they uptake more TMRE, and when they depolarize they lose the TMRE dye. Mitochondria that depolarize no longer have a sufficient membrane potential and tend not to fuse as efficiently if at all. Therefore, active fusing mitochondria can be tracked with these low levels of TMRE9,15. Accumulation of depolarized mitochondria that lack a TMRE signal may be a sign of phototoxicity or cell death. Higher concentrations of TMRE render mitochondria very sensitive to laser light, and therefore great care must be taken to avoid overlabeling with TMRE. If the effect of depolarization of mitochondria is the topic of interest, a technique using slightly higher levels of TMRE and more intense laser light can be used to depolarize mitochondria in a controlled fashion (Mitra and Lippincott-Schwartz, 2010). To ensure that toxicity due to TMRE is not an issue, we suggest exposing loaded cells (3-15 nM TMRE) to the imaging parameters that will be used in the assay (perhaps 7 stacks of 6 optical sections in a row), and assessing cell health after 2 hours. If the mitochondria appear too fragmented and cells are dying, other mitochondrial markers, such as dsRED or Mitotracker red could be used instead of TMRE. The mtPAGFP method has revealed details about mitochondrial network behavior that could not be visualized using other methods. For example, we now know that mitochondrial fusion can be full or transient, where matrix content can mix without changing the overall network morphology. Additionally, we know that the probability of fusion is independent of contact duration and organelle dimension, is influenced by organelle motility, membrane potential and history of previous fusion activity8,15,16,17. In this manuscript, we describe a methodology for scaling up the previously published protocol using mtPAGFP and 15nM TMRE8 in order to examine multiple cells at a time and improve the time efficiency of data collection without sacrificing the subcellular resolution. This has been made possible by the use of an automated microscope stage, and programmable image acquisition software. Zen software from Zeiss allows the user to mark and track several designated cells expressing mtPAGFP. Each of these cells can be photoactivated in a particular region of interest, and stacks of confocal slices can be monitored for mtPAGFP signal as well as TMRE at specified intervals. Other confocal systems could be used to perform this protocol provided there is an automated stage that is programmable, an incubator with CO2, and a means by which to photoactivate the PAGFP; either a multiphoton laser, or a 405 nm diode laser.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAlzheimer disease 3aParkinson disease 3aapoptosis 3aatrophy 3aautomation 3aautophagy 3acalcium 3acarbon dioxide 3acomputer software 3aconfocal microscopy 3acytosol 3adimerization 3adiodes 3adrugs 3aelectrochemistry 3aenergy 3aenergy metabolism 3afluorescent dyes 3ahomeostasis 3ahuman cell lines 3aimage analysis 3ain vitro studies 3aleucine zipper 3aluciferase 3amembrane potential 3amitochondria 3amitochondrial DNA 3amitochondrial membrane 3amixing 3amonitoring 3aphototoxicity 3aprobability 3aquality control 3ascreening 3asolutes 3atemperature1 aMolina, Anthony J.A.1 aCerqueira, Fernanda M.1 aTrudeau, Kyle1 aShirihai, Orian S.0 tJournal of visualized experiments.g2012 July 20, , no. 65 p.e3991-e3991dJournal of Visualized ExperimentswJournal:jnl4469330x1940-087X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3791/39913Available from publisher's site  uhttp://www.jove.com/video/3991/a-faster-high-resolution-mtpa-gfp-based-mitochondrial-fusion-assay  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02616naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245012900168300001800297520132500315592002801640650003001668650001201698650001301710650001601723650001301739651001101752653002201763653003801785653000801823653003601831653002601867653002301893653002901916700002301945710005601968773009902024856008602123852000902209655001202218IND60535070320221120180556.0190319e20150814xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053507032DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vaccine.2015.04.0382doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aButler, Robb10aDiagnosing the determinants of vaccine hesitancy in specific subgroups: The Guide to Tailoring Immunization Programmes (TIP)  ap. 4176-4179.  aDespite relatively high vaccination coverage rates in the European Region, vaccine hesitancy is undermining individual and community protection from vaccine preventable diseases. At the request of its European Technical Advisory Group of Experts on Immunization (ETAGE), the Vaccine-preventable Diseases and Immunization Programme of the WHO Regional Office for Europe (WHO/EURO) developed tools to help countries address hesitancy more effectively. The Guide to Tailoring Immunization Programmes (TIP), an evidence and theory based behavioral insight framework, issued in 2013, provides tools to (1) identify vaccine hesitant population subgroups, (2) diagnose their demand- and supply-side immunization barriers and enablers and (3) design evidence-informed responses to hesitancy appropriate to the subgroup setting, context and vaccine. The Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunization (SAGE) through its Working Group on Vaccine Hesitancy has closely followed the development, implementation, use and evolution of TIP concluding that TIP, with local adaptation, could be a valuable tool for use in all WHO regions, to help address countries’ vaccine hesitancy problems. The TIP principles are applicable to communicable, noncommunicable and emergency planning where behavioral decisions influence outcomes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aWorld Health Organization 3aexperts 3aplanning 3avaccination 3avaccines 3aEurope 0aVaccine hesitancy 0aTailoring immunization programmes 0aTIP 0aVaccine hesitancy interventions 0aCommunicable diseases 0aEmergency planning 0aNoncommunicable diseases1 aMacDonald, Noni E.2 athe SAGE Working Group on Vaccine Hesitancyeauthor0 tVaccine.g2015 Aug. 14, v. 33, no. 34 p.4176-4179dElsevier LtdwJournal:6210x0264-410X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2015.04.0383Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02293naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245006300169300001800232520103900250592002801289650002301317650003801340650002601378650001801404650002701422650001901449650001101468650003301479650002101512650001901533650003701552700001601589700001901605700001501624700001901639700002501658773010501683856008601788852000901874655001201883IND60578307120221122222718.0170812e20170627xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057830712DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.macromol.7b008732doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuang, Yucheng10aMatrix-Free Polymer Nanocomposite Thermoplastic Elastomers  ap. 4742-4753.  aThermoplastic elastomer (TPE) grafted nanoparticles were prepared by grafting block copolymer poly(styrene-block-(n-butyl acrylate)) onto silica nanoparticles (NPs) via surface-initiated reversible addition–fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) polymerization.

Cutting crops relatively high at harvest has some advantages, such as allowing faster harvest, and this also means that there is less horizontal residue on the soil surface. This field study tested the impact of standing wheat residue height and amount of horizontal residue on the interception, leaching and weed‐control efficacy of the pre‐emergent herbicide pyroxasulfone in the 2015 and 2016 growing seasons. RESULTS: Spray coverage of pyroxasulfone declined from 14.6% to 7.5% with increasing amounts (0 to 4 t ha⁻¹) of horizontal wheat residue. Horizontal wheat residue at 1 t ha⁻¹ had 10.3% spray coverage (more herbicide interception) compared with 15.4% for the equivalent amount of standing residue. Greater amounts of horizontal residue also significantly reduced the efficacy of pyroxasulfone in controlling ryegrass in the field and decreased pyroxasulfone concentrations in the soil. Rainfall after herbicide application increased herbicide efficacy for all residue amounts. Generally, cutting standing residue higher resulted a relatively small decrease in spray coverage at the soil surface and weed control efficacy, and this was significant only between nil stubble and 0.3 m cut height. CONCLUSION: Cutting residue relatively high, leaving less on the surface, improves spray coverage and herbicide efficacy compared with having more horizontal residue. This research may assist farmers and advisors to maximize the efficacy of pre‐emergent herbicide in no‐tillage systems. © 2019 Society of Chemical Industry  aPublisher supplied data 3aLolium 3aagricultural conservation practice 3acrops 3acutting 3afarmers 3agrowing season 3aharvesting 3aleaching 3ano-tillage 3apesticide application 3apyroxasulfone 3arain 3asoil 3aspray coverage 3astubble 3aweed control 3awheat1 aFlower, Ken1 aSiddique, Kadambot HM1 aWard, Phil0 tPest management science.g2020 Mar., v. 76, no. 3 p.861-867dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.wJournal:jnl59519x1526-498X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ps.55903Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01663naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004900094040001800143100001700161245008900178300001600267500000900283520055800292592002800850650001700878650001500895650001100910650001700921650001200938650001600950650001700966650001400983650001700997700001801014700001601032773014801048856009601196852000901292655001201301IND60668675820221120050352.0191125e197003  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066867582DNAL7 a10.2136/sssaj1970.03615995003400020034x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLowry, F.

Growth rate and yield were less on the 10-cm depth-to-pan treatment than on the 20- or 30-cm depth treatments.

Therefore, postprocessing of SWNTs including solubilization and sorting is necessary for further applications. Toward this goal, we have synthesized a polymer library consisting of fluorene- and carbazole-based homo- and copolymers. Variations of the connection of these aromatics together with the incorporation of further conjugated monomers give access to a broad diversity of polymers. Their ability to selectively wrap specific (n, m) species is investigated toward HiPco SWNTs raw material which contains more than 40 (n, m) species. Absorption and fluorescence spectroscopies were used to analyze SWNTs/polymer suspensions. These results provide evidence for selective SWNTs/polymer interactions and allow a more detailed assessment of polymer structure–property relationships, thus paving the way toward custom synthesis of polymers for single (n, m) SWNTs extraction.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3acarbon nanotubes 3acomposite polymers 3afluorenes 3afluorescence emission spectroscopy 3araw materials 3asolubilization1 aBerton, Nicolas1 aTittmann, Jana1 aHennrich, Frank1 aKappes, Manfred M.1 aMayor, Marcel0 tMacromolecules.g2012 Jan. 24, v. 45, no. 2 p.713-722dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-58357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fma201890g3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02711naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100002200154245010700176300001800283520173000301592002802031653003102059653002502090653001602115653002202131653001602153700002202169700002302191773009602214856009002310852000902400655001202409IND60127204020221120132642.0151110e200711  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012720402DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1558-5646.2007.00243.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSimmons, Leigh W.10aSperm competition games between sneaks and guards: a comparative analysis using dimorphic male beetles  ap. 2684-2692.  aSperm competition is widely recognized as a pervasive force of sexual selection. Theory predicts that across species increased risk of sperm competition should favor an increased expenditure on the ejaculate, a prediction for which there is much evidence. Sperm competition games have also been developed specifically for systems in which males adopt the alternative male mating tactics of sneaking copulations or guarding females. These models have not yet been tested in a comparative context, but predict that: across species male expenditure on the ejaculate should increase with increasing probability of a sneak mating; within species, sneaks should have the greater expenditure on the ejaculate; and the disparity in expenditure between sneaks and guards should be greatest in species with moderate risk of a sneak mating, and decline toward parity in species with low or high risk. Beetles in the genus Onthophagus are often characterized by dimorphic male morphologies that reflect the alternative mating tactics of sneak (minor males) and guard (major males). We conducted a comparative analysis across 16 species of male dimorphic onthophagines, finding that testes size increased across species with increasing frequency of the minor male phenotype. Minor males generally had the greater testes size, but across species the disparity between morphs was independent of the frequency of minor males. We present data on testes allometry from two populations of O. taurus that have undergone genetic divergence in the frequency of minor males. Consistent with the comparative analysis, these data support the notion that the relative frequency of sneaks in the population influences male expenditure on the ejaculate.  aPublisher supplied data 0aAlternative mating tactics 0acomparative analysis 0aOnthophagus 0asperm competition 0atestis size1 aEmlen, Douglas J.1 aTomkins, Joseph L.0 tEvolution.g2007 Nov., v. 61, no. 11 p.2684-2692dBlackwell Publishing Incx1558-56467nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111%2Fj.1558-5646.2007.00243.x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02791naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001600151245011100167520126700278592002801545650002801573650001401601650001901615650002701634650001901661650002001680650001101700650001701711650001501728650001001743650001901753650001501772650002201787650001601809650001901825650001401844650001301858650002101871653002201892653001501914653001901929653001601948653002201964700001601986700001302002700001502015700001502030700001802045773009102063856008602154852000902240655001202249IND60680620720221118064053.0210806e20200501xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068062072DNAL7 a10.1016/j.talanta.2020.1207322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLu, Xinling10aEvaluation of the accumulation of disulfiram and its copper complex in A549 cells using mass spectrometry  aThe famous alcohol-aversion drug disulfiram (DSF) is a promising candidate for repurposing in cancer therapy, as indicated by many ongoing and completed clinical trials. Existing researches focus on demonstrating that the anti-cancer activity of DSF is enhanced by copper ions, or solving the problem that DSF is easily decomposed in the body to lose its activity. However, the metabolic kinetics of its ultimate anti-cancer metabolite DDC-Cu (bis-diethyldithiocarbamate-copper) in cells and how it exerts anti-cancer mechanisms remain unclear. In this work, mass spectrometric evaluation of the intracellular and extracellular accumulation of DSF and its copper complex DDC-Cu was performed. Combined with cytotoxicity assay, staining analysis and flow cytometry, we found that DDC-Cu could easily pass through the cell membrane of A549 cells, and accumulate intracellularly for a long time. This process can lead to cellular morphological changes, an increase in ROS content, cell cycle arrest in the G0/G1 phase and apoptosis. Besides, molecular cancer-relevant targets of DDC-Cu in cancer cells were further discussed. This work investigated the cytotoxic mechanism of DDC-Cu, which has important clinical significance for its application in cancer therapy.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantineoplastic activity 3aapoptosis 3acancer therapy 3acell cycle checkpoints 3acell membranes 3aclinical trials 3acopper 3acytotoxicity 3adisulfiram 3adrugs 3aflow cytometry 3ainterphase 3amass spectrometry 3ametabolites 3aneoplasm cells 3aneoplasms 3astaining 3atoxicity testing 0aMass spectrometry 0aDisulfiram 0aCopper complex 0aA549 cells 0aDrug accumulation1 aLin, Binxin1 aXu, Ning1 aHuang, Hua1 aWang, Yong1 aLin, Jin-Ming0 tTalanta.g2020 May 01, v. 211 p.120732-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11742x0039-91407nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.talanta.2020.1207323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02843naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002100139245012800160300001600288520178500304592002802089650002302117650002102140650001202161650001102173650001802184650001202202650001602214700002102230700002102251700001602272700001902288773010202307856007502409852000902484655001202493IND60577760220221120174704.0170810e20120124xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057776022DNAL7 a10.1021/ma201988n2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSugihara, Shinji10aTransformation of Living Cationic Polymerization of Vinyl Ethers to RAFT Polymerization Mediated by a Carboxylic RAFT Agent  ap. 794-804.  aNovel block copolymers were synthesized by the transformation of living cationic polymerization of vinyl ethers into reversible addition–fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) polymerization using two types of RAFT agents. Examples include cationically polymerizable monomer of either isobutyl vinyl ether or 2-methoxyethyl vinyl ether (MOVE) and radically polymerizable monomer such as ethyl acrylate, styrene, tert-butoxy styrene, and N-isopropylacrylamide (NIPAM). The key to success in the block copolymerization is to utilize a RAFT agent of the carboxylic trithiocarbonate/SnBr₄ initiation system in the presence of an additive such as ethyl acetate and dioxane for living cationic polymerization. The living cationic polymerization was initiated from a proton derived from the carboxylic RAFT agent. After a certain period, the polymerization was quenched and the RAFT group as a counteranion was concurrently recovered, followed by the RAFT process of radical polymerization using azobis(isobutyronitrile) at 70 °C. The first segments of the poly(vinyl ether) showed high number-average end functionality for the RAFT terminal group, 0.79 or more, and which were available as a macro-chain transfer agent for radical polymerization. Furthermore, using the transformation process, novel diblock copolymers were also prepared, containing two thermoresponsive segments possessing different lower critical solution temperatures (LCSTs), poly(2-methoxyethyl vinyl ether)–poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PMOVE–PNIPAM) block copolymers. The resulting block copolymers reversibly formed or deformed micellar assemblies during two LCSTs. The mean micellar sizes were controlled by the composition of PMOVE and PNIPAM, indicating the successful formation of the block copolymers.  aPublisher supplied data 3acomposite polymers 3acopolymerization 3adioxane 3aethers 3aethyl acetate 3astyrene 3atemperature1 aYamashita, Kenta1 aMatsuzuka, Keiji1 aIkeda, Isao1 aMaeda, Yasushi0 tMacromolecules.g2012 Jan. 24, v. 45, no. 2 p.794-804dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-58357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fma201988n3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03331naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245013500165300001600300520179600316592002802112650001502140650002502155650001302180650002102193650002702214650001702241650001602258650001202274650001702286650001302303650001802316650001502334650001502349650001602364650002002380650001002400650001002410653002502420653002902445653002202474653001802496653002202514700002302536700001702559773015702576856008302733852000902816655001202825IND60656230220221122001422.0191004e201909  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065623022DNAL7 a10.1016/j.sajb.2019.08.0182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYounis, M.E.10aNanopriming technology enhances vigor and mitotic index of aged Vicia faba seeds using chemically synthesized silver nanoparticles  ap. 393-401.  aThis investigation was planned to utilize chemically synthesized silver nanoparticles (AgNPs), as a priming agent, for improving the germination of aged Vicia faba seeds. Application of AgNPs (0, 10, 50 and 100 ppm) to Vicia faba seeds led to distinctive endpoints indicating a reduction of aging-related genotoxic impacts at both cytological and physiological levels. Thus, priming with AgNPs induced a significant increase only in length of radicles, whereas the other determined growth parameters elicited non-significant changes in relation to control. In all treatments, total phenols increased slightly above control levels. Meanwhile, the highest value for catalase (CAT) activity was recorded with 100 ppm AgNPs. Ascorbate peroxidase (APX) decreased in the radicles but increased in the plumules with all concentrations used. Peroxidase (POX) and polyphenol oxidase (PPO) activities showed an opposite pattern compared with that of APX. For cyto-genotoxicity and mutagenicity assays, all of the treatments induced a significant increase in mitotic indices above those of control. Concerning genotoxicity assays, treated V. faba seeds significantly showed lower percentages of micronuclei and chromosomal abnormalities below those of control, in both interphasic and mitotic cells. Furthermore, treatment with silver nanoparticles elicited lower level of genotoxic and mutagenic aberrations than those maintained in the control. In conclusion, with increasing of AgNPs concentrations, the mitotic cell cycle and seedling growth were increased as compared with control. To our knowledge, this is the first report for seven-year-old seeds using nanoparticles. Thus, utilization of silver nanoparticles to enhance plant vigor under unfavorable environments appears to be conceivable.  aPublisher supplied data 3aVicia faba 3aascorbate peroxidase 3acatalase 3acatechol oxidase 3achromosome aberrations 3agenotoxicity 3agermination 3amitosis 3amutagenicity 3amutagens 3ananoparticles 3ananosilver 3aperoxidase 3apolyphenols 3aseedling growth 3aseeds 3avigor 0aSilver nanoparticles 0aAged seeds of Vicia faba 0aGrowth parameters 0aMitotic index 0aMicronucleus test1 aAbdel-Aziz, H.M.M.1 aHeikal, Y.M.0 tSouth African journal of botany.g2019 Sept., v. 125 p.393-401dElsevier B.V.aSouth African Association of BotanistswJournal:jnl34108x0254-62997nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.sajb.2019.08.0183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02713naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002400139245008800163300001800251520146200269592002801731650002301759650002601782650001301808650001301821650000901834650001401843650001101857653001301868653001501881653001901896653001301915653001501928700002001943700001901963700002301982700002302005700002102028700002402049773012202073856007502195852000902270655001202279IND60528211420170710000000.0160716e20140514xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052821142DNAL7 a10.1021/am405106h2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMeador, Mary Ann B.10aDielectric and Other Properties of Polyimide Aerogels Containing Fluorinated Blocks  ap. 6062-6068.  aThe dielectric and other properties of a series of low-density polyimide block copolymer aerogels have been characterized. Two different anhydride-capped polyimide oligomers were synthesized: one from 2,2-bis(3,4-dicarboxyphenyl)hexafluoropropane dianhydride (6FDA) and 4,4′-oxidianiline (ODA) and the other from biphenyl-3,3′,4,4′-tetracarboxylic dianhydride and ODA. The oligomers were combined with 1,3,5-triaminophenoxybenzene to form a block copolymer networked structure that gelled in under 1 h. The polyimide gels were supercritically dried to give aerogels with relative dielectric constants as low as 1.08. Increasing the amount of 6FDA blocks by up to 50% of the total dianhydride decreased the density of the aerogels, presumably by increasing the free volume and also by decreasing the amount of shrinkage seen upon processing, resulting in a concomitant decrease in the dielectric properties. In this study, we have also altered the density independent of fluorine substitution by changing the polymer concentration in the gelation reactions and showed that the change in dielectric due to density is the same with and without fluorine substitution. The aerogels with the lowest dielectric properties and lowest densities still had compressive moduli of 4–8 MPa (40 times higher than silica aerogels at the same density), making them suitable as low dielectric substrates for lightweight antennas for aeronautic and space applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3acomposite polymers 3adielectric properties 3afluorine 3agelation 3agels 3ashrinkage 3asilica 0aaerogels 0apolyimides 0alow dielectric 0aantennas 0amesoporous1 aMcMillon, Emily1 aSandberg, Anna1 aBarrios, Elizabeth1 aWilmoth, Nathan G.1 aMueller, Carl H.1 aMiranda, Félix A.,0 tACS Applied Materials & Interfaces.g2014 May 14, v. 6, no. 9 p.6062-6068dAmerican Chemical Societyx1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fam405106h3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02990naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100005500150245011600205300001800321520152900339592002801868650001801896650002601914650002201940650001501962650002801977650002102005650001902026650002002045650001302065650002602078650000902104650001702113700001902130700001302149700001602162700001702178700001702195700001902212700002102231700002002252700002702272773012802299856008402427852000902511655001202520IND60680535720221119010704.0200107e20191220xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068053572DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.analchem.9b039522doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGao, Xinliu1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3105-726410aTargeted Host Cell Protein Quantification by LC–MRM Enables Biologics Processing and Product Characterization  ap. 1007-1015.  aMultiple reaction monitoring (MRM) is a liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry (LC–MS) based quantification platform with high sensitivity, specificity, and throughput. It is extensively used across the pharmaceutical industry for the quantitative analysis of therapeutic molecules. The potential of MRM analysis for the quantification of specific host cell proteins (HCPs) in bioprocess, however, has yet to be well established. In this work, we introduce a multiplex LC–MRM assay that simultaneously monitors two high risk lipases known to impact biologics product quality, Phospholipase B-like 2 protein (PLBL2) and Group XV lysosomal phospholipase A2 (LPLA2). Quantitative data generated from the LC–MRM assay were used to monitor the clearance of these lipases during biologics process development. The method is linear over a dynamic range of 1 to 500 ng/mg. To demonstrate the fitness for use and robustness of this assay, we evaluate a comprehensive method qualification package that includes intra- and inter-run precision and accuracy across all evaluated concentrations, selectivity, recovery and matrix effect, dilution linearity, and carryover. Additionally, we illustrate that this assay provides a rapid and accurate means of monitoring high risk HCP clearance for in-process support and can actively guide process improvement and optimization. Lastly, we compare direct digestion platforms and affinity depletion platforms to demonstrate the impact of HCP–mAb interaction on lipase quantification.  aPublisher supplied data 3abioprocessing 3aliquid chromatography 3amass spectrometry 3amonitoring 3apharmaceutical industry 3aphospholipase A2 3aphospholipases 3aproduct quality 3aproteins 3aquantitative analysis 3arisk 3atherapeutics1 aRawal, Baibhav1 aWang, Yi1 aLi, Xuanwen1 aWylie, David1 aLiu, Yan-Hui1 aBreunig, Lloyd1 aDriscoll, Dennis1 aWang, Fengqiang1 aRichardson, Douglas D.0 tAnalytical chemistry.g2019 Dec. 20, v. 92, no. 1 p.1007-1015dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:jnl70375x1520-68827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.analchem.9b039523Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04899naa a2200649 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001600148245019000164300001600354520283300370592002803203650003403231650002403265650002503289650001803314650002203332650002803354650002503382650001503407650003603422650001903458650001003477650002203487650001203509650001503521650002003536650002803556650001303584650001603597650001903613650001403632650003303646650005803679650001803737650001003755650001303765650001203778650001503790650001803805650001503823653002203838653001603860653001703876653002703893653001503920653001203935653002503947700001603972773015703988856008304145852000904228655001204237IND60656230320221121230310.0191004e201909  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065623032DNAL7 a10.1016/j.sajb.2019.08.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAttar, U.A.10aIn vitro antioxidant, antidiabetic, antiacetylcholine esterase, anticancer activities and RP-HPLC analysis of phenolics from the wild bottle gourd (Lagenaria siceraria (Molina) Standl.)  ap. 360-370.  aLagenaria siceraria is the most popular and widely used fruit vegetable due to its immense health promoting properties. The aim of the present study was to evaluate phytochemicals and biological activities of the different fruit parts (epicarp, mesocarp and seeds) of wild bottle gourd extracted with acetone, ethanol, methanol and water. Present study highlighted that seeds extracted with ethanol showed significantly higher total phenolics content (TPC) and total flavonoids content (TFC) (112.58 ± 1.39 mg TAE/g extract; 12.82 ± 0.64 mg CE/g extract, respectively). However, aqueous seeds extract had slightly higher (2.27 ± 0.05 mg CE/g extract) total tannins content (TTC) than ethanolic seeds extract. In addition, total terpenoids content (TTEC) was recorded higher in acetone seed extracts (384.19 ± 19.1 mg UAE/g extract). In antioxidant evaluation, methanolic extract of seeds exhibited considerable DPPH (2, 2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl) and ABTS (2, 2′-Azino-bis-(3-ethyl) benzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) radical scavenging activities (54.08 ± 0.67 mg TE/g extract and 38.58 ± 0.36 mg EE/g extract, respectively). However, ethanol and acetone seed extracts revealed significant phosphomolybdenum and FRAP (ferric reducing antioxidant property) activities (285.56 ± 3.71 and 72.32 ± 0.52 mg TE/g extract, respectively). In contrast, mesocarp extracted with water showed highest (15.17 ± 0.08 mg EE/g extract) metal chelating activity. Overall, ethanolic seed extract was found to be the excellent combination for the recovery of metabolites. Principal component analysis (PCA) revealed the discrimination of phytochemical profile and antioxidant potential of studied extracts and fruit parts. Ethanolic seed extracts exhibited appreciable α-amylase inhibition (28.96% at 1000 μg extract) and acetylcholine esterase inhibition (56.49% at 300 μg extract), however, α-glucosidase inhibition (71.85% at 300 μg extract) was highest in methanol extract. The bitter principle isolated from the seeds revealed potent anticancer activities against MCF-7 (GI50 < 10 μg/mL, TGI 133.42 μg/mL, LC50 301.21 μg/mL) and HT-29 (GI50 < 10 μg/mL, TGI 6.12 μg/mL, LC50 664.02 μg/mL) cancer cell lines. In RP-HPLC analysis, epicarp extracted with methanol showed highest hydroxybenzoic acid (72.46 ± 0.32 mg/g FW), vanillic acid (69.35 ± 0.73 mg/g FW) and coumaric acid (48.43 ± 0.52 mg/g FW). The study concluded that wild bottle gourd is an excellent source of bioactive metabolites responsible for the potent antioxidant, antidiabetic, antiacetylcholine esterase and anticancer activities. Further, extensive investigations to develop effective drug from the wild bottle gourd against such diseases is needed.  aPublisher supplied data 3a2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl 3aLagenaria siceraria 3aacetylcholinesterase 3aalpha-amylase 3aalpha-glucosidase 3aantineoplastic activity 3aantioxidant activity 3acell lines 3achemical constituents of plants 3acoumaric acids 3adrugs 3aenzyme inhibition 3aexocarp 3aflavonoids 3aglycemic effect 3alethal concentration 50 3amesocarp 3ametabolites 3aneoplasm cells 3aneoplasms 3aprincipal component analysis 3areversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography 3aseed extracts 3aseeds 3asolvents 3atannins 3aterpenoids 3avanillic acid 3avegetables 0aWild bottle gourd 0aAntioxidant 0aAntidiabetic 0aAcetylcholine esterase 0aAnticancer 0aRP-HPLC 0aChemometric analysis1 aGhane, S.G.0 tSouth African journal of botany.g2019 Sept., v. 125 p.360-370dElsevier B.V.aSouth African Association of BotanistswJournal:jnl34108x0254-62997nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.sajb.2019.08.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02179naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002200139245014100161300001800302520095800320592002801278650002601306650002401332650001401356650001101370650001301381653001601394653002101410653002001431653003301451653001701484700002001501700002301521700002101544700002101565773012501586856007301711852000901784655001201793IND60528211620221118073718.0160716e20140514xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052821162DNAL7 a10.1021/am405138e2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMcNair, Olivia D.10aSequential Thiol Click Reactions: Formation of Ternary Thiourethane/Thiol–Ene Networks with Enhanced Thermal and Mechanical Properties  ap. 6088-6097.  aWe report the physical properties of thiol–ene networks modified with thiourethane or urethane linkages, either along the main chain or as a branched component in the network, respectively. Because of the robust and orthogonal nature of thiol-isocyanate and thiol–ene reactions, these networks can be formed in a two-step, one-pot synthesis. Resultant networks were characterized using dynamic mechanical analysis, mechanical testing and other complementary techniques. It was found that incorporating (thio)urethanes into the networks increased Tg, but also increased strain at break and toughness while decreasing cross-link density. The changes in physical properties are discussed in terms of a proposed dual network morphology. These facile modifications to thiol–ene networks demonstrate how molecular-level, nanoscale changes can have a profound influence on the macroscale properties through hierarchical development of network morphology.  aPublisher supplied data 3amechanical properties 3aphysical properties 3asynthesis 3athiols 3aurethane 0athiol−ene 0athiol-isocyanate 0aclick chemistry 0aglass transition temperature 0adual network1 aBrent, Davis

Vero cells were successfully adapted to ProVero™-1 SFM, reaching growth rates similar to serum-containing cultures (0.030 1/h vs 0.026 1/h, respectively). An in-situ cell detachment method was successfully implemented, with efficiencies above 85%. Up to 2.5-fold increase in maximum cell concentration was obtained using perfusion when compared to batch culture. Combining perfusion with the in-situ cell detachment method enabled the scale-up to 20 L STB directly from a 2 L STB, surpassing the need for a mid-scale platform (i.e. 5 L STB) and thus reducing seed train duration. Head-to-head comparison of cell growth and PPRV production in the 2 L and 20 L STB was performed, and no significant differences could be observed. Estimated infectious PPRV titers in Tissue Culture Infection Dose (TCID50) (TCID50/mL = 5 × 106 and TCID50/cell = 5) are within the log-range reported in literature for PPRV production in STB and SFM by Silva et al. (2008), thus confirming the feasibility and scalability of the seed train designed [1].The novel and scalable vaccine production process herein proposed has the potential to assist the upcoming Peste des Petites Ruminants (PPR) Global Eradication Program (targeted by FAAO for 2030) by providing African local and/or regional manufacturers with a platform capable of generating over 25,000 doses of Nigeria 75/1 strain in just 19 days using a 20 L STB.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSmall ruminant morbillivirus 3abioprocessing 3abioreactors 3acell growth 3atissue culture 3avaccine development 3avaccines 3aviruses 3aNigeria 0aVero cells 0aMicrocarrier technology 0aIn-situ cell detachment 0aPerfusion 0aScale-up1 aFenge, Christel1 aRupprecht, Jens1 aTappe, Alexander1 aGreller, Gerhard1 aAlves, Paula1 aCarrondo, Manuel1 aRoldão, António1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0414-48990 tVaccine.g2019 Nov. 08, v. 37, no. 47 p.7041-7051dElsevier LtdwJournal:6210x0264-410X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2019.07.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02695naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002100143245009400164300001600258520158900274592002801863650002701891650002101918650002501939650002101964650001101985650003401996653001702030653003002047653001802077653001902095653002102114700002602135773008602161856007702247852000902324655001202333IND60515603620221119044528.0160316e20130304xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051560362DNAL7 a10.1139/cjb-2012-01902doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShafiullah, M.D.10aComparative leaf development of aerial and aquatic growth forms of Myriophyllum aquaticum  ap. 421-430.  aMyriophyllum aquaticum (Vell.) Verdc. produces two morphologically different forms of leaves based on whether they are aerial or aquatic. The objective of this study was to determine whether there are any similarities or differences between these two growth forms during their early stages of development. A comparative developmental study of aerial and aquatic growth forms of M. aquaticum was conducted from a qualitative and quantitative perspective using a scanning electron microscope. The pattern of leaf and lobe initiation such as their origin and shape were similar in both growth forms until the fourth plastochron (stage P4). Differences between the two growth forms became evident from stage P5 onward, where a larger shoot apical meristem (SAM), elongated epidermal cells, shorter and slightly more numerous lobes, as well as the presence of appendage-like structures characterized aquatic growth forms. On the other hand, aerial growth forms had smaller SAM, bulb-like epidermal cells, and longer and slightly less numerous leaf lobes. Significant differences between growth forms were noted for parameters such as volume of SAM, length of terminal, first, and middle lobes, as well as the length from first to last lobes. The volume of the SAM of aquatic shoot tips was always greater than aerial forms. On the other hand, lobes of aerial forms were always longer than the aquatic counterpart during early stages of development. This study on the development of M. aquaticum shows that the aerial and aquatic growth forms diverge from their early stages of development.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMyriophyllum aquaticum 3aapical meristems 3adevelopmental stages 3aleaf development 3aleaves 3ascanning electron microscopes 0aMyriophyllum 0aaerial and aquatic leaves 0amorphogenesis 0aleaf primordia 0aleaf development1 aLacroix, Christian R.0 tBotany.g2013 Mar. 4, v. 91, no. 7 p.421-430dNRC Research Pressx1916-28047nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjb-2012-01903Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03450naa a2200649 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001500147245010700162300001600269500001500285520156100300592002801861650001601889650001601905650001801921650002201939650001301961650002201974650002501996650001202021650001902033650002402052650002702076650002502103650001502128650002102143650003202164650002302196653002502219653002202244653001202266653001702278653002002295653004802315653002602363700001302389700002002402700001902422700001702441700001302458700001502471700001602486700001602502700001502518700001502533700001702548700001802565700001402583773010102597856008102698852000902779655001202788IND60554149720221120173713.0161024e20140915xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055414972DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bej.2014.06.0142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Liang10aInherent antioxidant activity and high yield production of antioxidants in Phanerochaete chrysosporium  ap. 245-254.  a2019-12-06  aIncremental reactive oxygen species (ROS) under adversity environment could cause oxidative damages to microorganisms during environmental applications. In this study, we highlight a novel role of P. chrysosporium as antioxidants. The P. chrysosporium extracts possessed remarkable antioxidant activity, expressing a dose-dependent total antioxidant activity and accompanied with high reactive oxygen radical (O2–, OH and H2O2) scavenging capacity. In addition, it was established that, various compounds, such as antioxidant enzymes (catalase, superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase) and low-molecular-weight antioxidant components (glutathione, phenolics and flavonoids) existed steadily in P. chrysosporium. Linear regression analysis and Pearson correlation coefficient analysis demonstrated that enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidants took part in processes and acted as “antioxidant network” in P. chrysosporium by confirming with the significant correlation coefficients among the tested antioxidants. Furthermore, those tested antioxidants were found sensitive response to Cd exposure, a 2.78-fold and 2.35-fold of stimulation has been found in SOD and phenolics, respectively, which provide a novel dimension to the involvement of antioxidants in the antioxidant defense system of P. chrysosporium. The paper proposes a new validation procedure to specifically validate the admirable tolerance and high efficiency of P. chrysosporium in environmental treatment application, taking advantage of the remarkable antioxidant activity.  aPublisher supplied data 3acorrelation 3aglutathione 3adose response 3ahydroxyl radicals 3acatalase 3ahydrogen peroxide 3asuperoxide dismutase 3acadmium 3amicroorganisms 3aregression analysis 3aglutathione peroxidase 3aantioxidant activity 3aflavonoids 3asuperoxide anion 3aPhanerochaete chrysosporium 3aphenolic compounds 0aAntioxidant capacity 0aFilamentous fungi 0aEnzymes 0aantioxidants 0aOxygen transfer 0aReactive oxygen radical scavenging capacity 0aBiophysical chemistry1 aXu, Piao1 aZeng, Guangming1 aHuang, Danlian1 aZhao, Meihua1 aLai, Cui1 aChen, Ming1 aLi, Ningjie1 aHuang, Chao1 aWang, Cong1 aCheng, Min1 aHe, Xiaoxiao1 aLai, Mingyong1 aHe, Yibin0 tBiochemical engineering journal.g2014 Sept. 15, v. 90 p.245-254dElsevier B.V.x1369-703X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bej.2014.06.0143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02905naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002100143245014600164300001600310520137700326592002801703650002401731650002001755650001101775650001401786650002201800650003001822650001201852650002401864650001501888650001601903650001901919650002001938651001001958651002101968651002301989651001102012653002202023653002702045653002402072653001802096653001702114700002102131700002002152700001902172700002302191773008702214856007702301852000902378655001202387IND60515603720221119044559.0160316e20130410xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051560372DNAL7 a10.1139/cjb-2012-02122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShimono, Yoshiko10aPhylogeography based on intraspecific sequence variation in chloroplast DNA of Miscanthus sinensis (Poaceae), a native pioneer grass in Japan  ap. 449-456.  aMiscanthus sinensis Andersson is a dominant perennial grass in East Asia, where it is a pioneer species in disturbed habitats. To obtain basic information about the genetic structure of this pioneer species, we investigated chloroplast DNA (cpDNA) variation in M. sinensis within and among native populations across Japan. We detected nine haplotypes in 636 individuals from 30 populations. Two distinct haplotypes had a wide geographical distribution and coexisted within most of the populations. The degree of genetic differentiation among the populations was relatively low. Two putative ancestral lineages were distributed in the Ryukyu Islands. Therefore, it is possible that lineages that originated in subtropical areas of mainland China migrated into the Ryukyu Islands via Taiwan. Another possible migration route is the Korean Peninsula. Two major haplotypes may have migrated from the Eurasian continent to the northern coast in Kyushu via the Korean Peninsula and then expanded throughout Japan. There was no clear genetic boundary among the populations north of Kyushu. The enhanced immigration ability and high rate of gene flow of Miscanthus may have modulated the genetic structure created during previous glacial periods. Alternatively, the shortage of unique haplotypes north of Kyushu may indicate the recent expansion of this species to northern Japan.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMiscanthus sinensis 3achloroplast DNA 3acoasts 3agene flow 3agenetic variation 3ageographical distribution 3agrasses 3ahabitat destruction 3ahaplotypes 3aimmigration 3aphylogeography 3apioneer species 3aChina 3aKorean Peninsula 3aRyukyu Archipelago 3aTaiwan 0agenetic structure 0ahaplotype distribution 0aMiscanthus sinensis 0apioneer plant 0asilver grass1 aKurokawa, Shunji1 aNishida, Tomoko1 aIkeda, Hiroaki1 aFutagami, Norihiko0 tBotany.g2013 Apr. 10, v. 91, no. 7 p.449-456dNRC Research Pressx1916-28047nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjb-2012-02123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04602naa a2200697 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002200094024001900116024003500135040001800170100001400188245012800202300001200330506007600342520254800418592002802966596003802994596004203032506003703074650001803111650001603129650001303145650000803158650001403166650001803180650001503198650001903213650001503232650000903247650000903256650001003265650001003275650002103285650002303306650002503329650001403354650001703368650001403385650003003399650001803429650001503447650001303462650001703475650001103492651001203503700002003515700002303535700002503558700002003583700002103603700002003624700001703644700001603661700001603677773010803693856008203801852000903883655001203892IND60572294820221207065859.0220818e201712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057229482DNAL7 aPMC53796972pmcid7 a283769032pmid7 a10.1186/s13071-017-2106-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBeck, Ana14aThe prevalence and impact of Babesia canis and Theileria sp. in free-ranging grey wolf (Canis lupus) populations in Croatia  ap. 168.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: Babesia spp. and Theileria spp. are important emerging causes of disease in dogs. Alongside these domesticated hosts, there is increasing recognition that these piroplasms can also be found in a range of wild animals with isolated reports describing the presence of these pathogen in foxes (Vulpes vulpes) and captive grey wolves (Canis lupus). The prevalence and impact of these infections in free-ranging populations of canids are unknown. To gain a better insight into the epidemiology and pathogenesis of piroplasm infections in free-ranging grey wolves, pathological and molecular investigations into captive and free-ranging grey wolves in Croatia were performed. RESULTS: The carcasses of 107 free-ranging wolves and one captive wolf were the subjects of post-mortem investigations and sampling for molecular studies. A blood sample from one live captured wolf for telemetric tracking was also used for molecular analysis. PCR amplification targeting the 18S RNA gene revealed that 21 of 108 free-ranging wolves and one captive animal were positive for Theileria/Babesia DNA. Subsequent sequencing of a fragment of the 18S RNA gene revealed that 7/22 animals were positive for Babesia canis while the other amplified sequence were found to be identical with corresponding 18S rDNA sequences of Theileria capreoli isolated from wild deer (15/22). Haematological and cytological analysis revealed the presence of signet-ring shaped or pear-shaped piroplasms in several animals with the overall parasite burden in all positive animals assessed to be very low. Pathological investigation of the captive animal revealed fatal septicemia as a likely outcome of hemolytic anaemia. There was little or no evidence of hemolytic disease consistent with babesiosis in other animals. CONCLUSION: Importantly, the presence of B. canis in free-ranging grey wolves has not been described before but has been reported in a single fox and domestic dogs only. That B. canis infections cause disease in dogs but have little impact on wolf health possibly suggests that the wolf is the natural and the domestic dog is a secondary host. Surprisingly, the frequent finding of Theileria capreoli in wolves suggests that this Theileria species is not restricted to ungulates (cervids) but commonly infects also this carnivore species. Nevertheless, the potential role that these asymptomatically infected animals may play in the dispersal of these pathogens to susceptible sympatric species such as domesticated dogs requires further investigation.  aPublisher supplied data  a1957cHrvatska Zaklada za Znanost  aVetMedZGcSeventh Framework Programme0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aBabesia canis 3aCanis lupus 3aCervidae 3aRNA 3aTheileria 3aVulpes vulpes 3ababesiosis 3ablood sampling 3acarnivores 3adeer 3adogs 3afoxes 3agenes 3ahemolytic anemia 3aintermediate hosts 3anucleotide sequences 3aparasites 3apathogenesis 3apathogens 3apolymerase chain reaction 3aribosomal DNA 3asepticemia 3asympatry 3awild animals 3awolves 3aCroatia1 aHuber, Doroteja1 aPolkinghorne, Adam1 aKurilj, Andrea Gudan1 aBenko, Valerija1 aMrljak, Vladimir1 aReljić, Slaven1 aKusak, Josip1 aReil, Irena1 aBeck, Relja0 tParasites & vectors.g2017 Dec., v. 10, no. 1 p.168-168dBioMed CentralwJournal:24143x1756-33057nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13071-017-2106-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02679naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245013400169520135500303592002801658650001101686650000901697650001501706650003001721650002401751653002701775653003501802653004401837653002501881653002101906700001801927700005401945700001501999700001902014700002002033700001402053700001702067773009102084856008502175852000902260655001202269IND60778775520221117054923.0220726e20220901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077877552DNAL7 a10.1016/j.energy.2022.1242612doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Jianyong10aPotentials of implementing liquid-separation to a transient wrap-around microchannel condenser coil within heat pump water heater  aDynamic characteristics of wrap-around microchannel condenser coil are essential to heat pump water heater (HPWH) during heating-up transient.

Its predictions on both liquid-separation microchannel condenser coil (LMC) and conventional microchannel condenser coil (CMC) are in good agreements with experimental data. Results show that simply employing separators in the condenser coil (LMC-I) does not bring improvement. The average heat transfer coefficient of LMC-I is enhanced by 10.34% and 5.75% at the entrances of the second and third paths compared to that of CMC, respectively, whereas it is degraded at the outlets of the second and third paths as well as in the entire fourth path. However, LMC-I achieves a significant pressure drop reduction by 34.48%. Thereafter, LMC-II is screened from 963 candidates of path arrangements, and has better performances in terms of higher heat capacity and shorter heating time than both CMC and LMC-I. Its average proportion of 51.83% of two-phase area to the total area is also superior to both CMC and LMC-I.  aPublisher supplied data 3aenergy 3aheat 3aheat pumps 3aheat transfer coefficient 3amathematical models 0aHeat pump water heater 0aLiquid-separation condensation 0aWrap-around microchannel condenser coil 0aHeating-up transient 0aPath arrangement1 aChen, Liuxing1 aLi, Junjie1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2625-74671 aChen, Ying1 aLuo, Xianglong1 aLiang, Yingzong1 aYang, Zhi1 aHe, Jiacheng0 tEnergy.g2022 Sept. 01, v. 254 p.124261-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12436x0360-54427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2022.1242613Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01665naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100005800149245010700207300001800314500001900332520060300351592002800954650002300982650002701005650001401032700006001046700005701106773012001163856008301283852000901366655001201375IND60733006320221118034432.0210402e20210310xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073300632DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.orglett.1c003912doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNale, Sagar D.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6326-318810aConstruction of Highly Functionalized Xanthones via Rh-Catalyzed Cascade C–H Activation/O-Annulation  ap. 2465-2470.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aA facile and efficient strategy for obtaining functionalized and multihydroxylated xanthones via Rh catalysis under redox-neutral conditions is developed.

However, there remains uncertainty regarding the sources of the precursor gases leading to particle growth, particularly in isoprene-rich forests. In this study, particle growth events were observed from the 14 total events (31% of days) during summer measurements (June 24 – August 2, 2014) at the Program for Research on Oxidants PHotochemistry, Emissions, and Transport (PROPHET) tower within the forested University of Michigan Biological Station located in northern Michigan. Growth events were observed within long-range transported air masses from urban areas, air masses impacted by wildfires, as well as stagnant, forested/regional air masses. Growth events observed during urban-influenced air masses were prevalent, with presumably high oxidant levels, and began midday during periods of high solar radiation. This suggests that increased oxidation of biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOCs) likely contributed to the highest observed particle growth in this study (8 ± 2 nm h−1). Growth events during wildfire-influenced air masses were observed primarily at night and had slower growth rates (3 ± 1 nm h−1). These events were likely influenced by increased SO2, O3, and NO2 transported within the smoke plumes, suggesting a role of NO3 oxidation in the production of semi-volatile compounds. Forested/regional air mass growth events likely occurred due to the oxidation of regionally emitted BVOCs, including isoprene, monoterpenes, and sesquiterpenes, which facilitated multiday growth events also with slower rates (3 ± 2 nm h−1). Intense sulfur, carbon, and oxygen signals in individual particles down to 20 nm, analyzed by transmission electron microscopy with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (TEM-EDX), suggest that H2SO4 and secondary organic aerosol contributed to particle growth. Overall, aerosol growth was frequently observed in a range of air masses (urban, wildfire, forested) and oxidant conditions (day vs. night), with rates ranging from 0.8 to 10.2 nm h−1.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaerosols 3aair 3aatmospheric chemistry 3acarbon 3aemissions 3aenergy-dispersive X-ray analysis 3aforests 3aisoprene 3amonoterpenoids 3anitrates 3anitrogen dioxide 3aoxidants 3aoxidation 3aoxygen 3aozone 3aphotochemistry 3asesquiterpenoids 3asmoke 3asolar radiation 3asulfur 3asulfur dioxide 3asulfuric acid 3asummer 3atransmission electron microscopy 3auncertainty 3aurban areas 3avolatile organic compounds 3awildfires 3aMichigan 0aParticle growth 0aForest 0aMichigan 0aWildfire 0aRemote1 aSchmidt, Stephanie A.1 aGardner, Daniel J.1 aBondy, Amy L.1 aMay, Nathaniel W.1 aBertman, Steven B.1 aPratt, Kerri A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4707-22901 aAult, Andrew P.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7313-85590 tAtmospheric environment.g2018 Apr., v. 178 p.255-264dElsevier LtdwJournal:12031x1352-23107nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.atmosenv.2018.01.0583Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03333naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002800152245012500180300001300305520163300318592002801951650001501979650002301994650002002017650002302037650002102060650002102081650001802102650001702120650002102137650001102158650001502169650001902184650001002203650001702213650001502230650001702245650001302262653002002275653002502295653003002320653002302350653002502373653003702398700002302435700002302458700002302481700002002504700002202524700002102546773010402567856008702671852000902758655001202767IND60628638420221120045448.0190319e20190315xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062863842DNAL7 a10.1016/j.atmosenv.2018.12.0302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRincón, Carlos Andrés10aOdor concentration (OC) prediction based on odor activity values (OAVs) during composting of solid wastes and digestates  ap. 1-12.  aOdor monitoring plays a crucial role in implementing suitable odor mitigation strategies at composting plants. Odor activity value (OAV) analysis is an instrumental-based approach that could simplify and reduce costs of odor monitoring by dynamic olfactometry; yet, the relationship between both methodologies has not been fully explored. In this study, the OAV feasibility to predict odor concentration (OC in OUE m−3) was assessed during the active composting phase of six solid wastes and three digestates at pilot scale. To this end, 92 gas samples were analyzed by analytical methods (i.e., GC/MS) and dynamic olfactometry (EN 13725). For 22 quantified odorants, OAV was calculated as the ratio of a compound's chemical concentration to its corresponding odor detection threshold (ODT). OAVs were then correlated to OC by simple linear and partial least squares (PLS) regressions. The sum of all OAVs in the gas samples (OAVsum) and the maximum OAV (OAVmax) yielded moderately strong linear correlations against OC (R2: 0.67–0.73), thus providing overall insight into OC trend along composting. A PLS model consisting of weighted OAVs of 10 odorants enhanced OC predictions. OAVs explained from 76% to 74% of the OC variance throughout the PLS model validation. Furthermore, OC values regressed by the PLS model were less underestimated (7%) than those predicted by OAVmax and OAVsum (11–13%). Based on results from the OAVmax and PLS regression analysis, hydrogen sulfide, methanethiol, dimethyl sulfide, and dimethyl disulfide were highlighted as the major odor contributors during composting of organic substrates.  aPublisher supplied data 3acomposting 3acost effectiveness 3adetection limit 3adimethyl disulfide 3adimethyl sulfide 3ahydrogen sulfide 3aleast squares 3amethanethiol 3amodel validation 3amodels 3amonitoring 3aodor compounds 3aodors 3aolfactometry 3aprediction 3asolid wastes 3avariance 0aOdor monitoring 0aDynamic olfactometry 0aOdor detection thresholds 0aAnalytical methods 0aOdor activity values 0aPartial least squares regression1 aDe Guardia, Amaury1 aCouvert, Annabelle1 aWolbert, Dominique1 aLe Roux, Sophie1 aSoutrel, Isabelle1 aNunes, Guillaume0 tAtmospheric environment.g2019 Mar. 15, v. 201 p.1-12dElsevier LtdwJournal:12031x1352-23107nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.atmosenv.2018.12.0303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02935naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001600149245009500165520147100260592002801731650002701759650001201786650002001798650002901818650001601847650001401863650001101877650002001888650002101908650000901929650002201938650001501960650001301975650001501988650002902003650001702032650001902049651001202068653000802080653000802088653000802096653000802104653002702112653002602139653000902165653002102174700002302195773009402218856008402312852000902396655001202405IND60682319720221122234141.0201125e202004  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068231972DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enpol.2020.1112772doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHöfer, Tim12aA participatory stakeholder process for evaluating sustainable energy transition scenarios  aThis paper presents an evaluation of four energy transition scenarios under consideration of multiple stakeholder opinions. We construct a multi-criteria group decision model that applies Value-Focused Thinking to construct a holistic objective system and uses Multi-Attribute Utility Theory to evaluate the energy transition scenarios. Although the individual scenario evaluations show that the opinions of the stakeholders towards a sustainable energy transition differ largely, we are able to identify three main strands of opinions among the considered stakeholders. By bundling the stakeholder interests by employing a k-means clustering technique, we derive detailed policy recommendations for a sustainable energy transition. For the case of Germany, these are to reduce GHG and pollutant emissions and at the same time enable citizens’ participation, limit the visual impact on landscapes, and ensuring internationally comparable energy-related political frameworks for the economy. For the case of a sustainable energy transition in Germany, we find that the stakeholders considered prefer either the highly ambitious Climate Protection scenario (Scenario B) or the Pan-European scenario (Scenario C). The main novelties of the study are that stakeholders are included in every step of the decision-making process and that very comprehensive energy transition scenarios, comprising the electricity, transport, heat, and industry sectors, are considered.  aPublisher supplied data 3aattitudes and opinions 3aclimate 3adecision making 3adecision support systems 3aelectricity 3aemissions 3aenergy 3aenergy industry 3agreenhouse gases 3aheat 3aissues and policy 3alandscapes 3apolitics 3apollutants 3arenewable energy sources 3astakeholders 3atransportation 3aGermany 0aD70 0aD81 0aO52 0aQ48 0aValue-Focused Thinking 0aGroup decision making 0aMAUT 0aEnergy scenarios1 aMadlener, Reinhard0 tEnergy policy.g2020 Apr., v. 139 p.111277-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12439x0301-42157nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enpol.2020.1112773Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03941naa a2200697 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003100113040001800144100002200162245019100184300001800375520174200393592002802135650002302163650000902186650001802195650001702213650001802230650001102248650001902259650001102278650002802289650001602317650002502333650001902358650001602377650001002393650001002403650001702413650001102430650001602441650004702457650001202504650001102516650005502527650002202582650001302604650002402617650003302641650002202674650001202696650005402708650002302762650002402785651001102809653001102820653003202831653003002863653001102893700002602904700001702930700002602947700001702973773015402990856007803144852000903222655001203231IND60083505820221120102600.0190318e201310  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008350582DNAL7 a239580212pmid7 a10.3168/jds.2013-68412doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAbeysekara, Saman10aMolecular structure, chemical and nutrient profiles, and metabolic characteristics of the proteins and energy in new cool-season corn varieties harvested as fresh forage for dairy cattle  ap. 6631-6643.  aTo our knowledge, no previous research exists concerning the molecular structure and metabolic characteristics of the proteins and energy that new cool-season corn varieties provide for dairy cattle. The objectives of this study were to identify the differences in the molecular structures of proteins among several new cool-season corn varieties [Pioneer P7443R, Pioneer P7213R, Pioneer P7535R (Pioneer Hi-Bred International Inc., Johnston, IA), Hyland Baxxos RR, Hyland SR22, and Hyland SR06 (Hyland Seeds, Blenheim, ON, Canada)] using Fourier transform infrared attenuated total reflectance (FT/IR-ATR) molecular spectroscopy, and to determine the nutrient profile and supply that each variety provided for dairy cattle. The protein molecular structure studies showed that the amide I to amide II ratio ranged from 1.09 to 1.66 and that the α-helix to β-sheet ratio ranged from 0.95 to 1.01 among the new cool-season corn varieties. Energy content was significantly different among the new varieties. We found significant differences in the protein and carbohydrate subfractions and in the ruminal degradation kinetics of the organic matter, crude protein, starch, and neutral detergent fiber of the new varieties. The new varieties had similar estimated intestinal digestibilities for rumen undegraded crude protein. However, the new varieties had significant differences in predicted total truly absorbable protein, ranging from 39 to 57g/kg of dry matter, indicating that these newly developed varieties are satisfactory sources of truly absorbed protein for dairy cattle. Further study on the molecular structure profiles of cool-season corn in relation to its nutrient utilization and availability in dairy cattle is necessary.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemical structure 3acorn 3acrude protein 3adairy cattle 3adairy protein 3aenergy 3aenergy content 3aforage 3aneutral detergent fiber 3anew variety 3anutrient utilization 3aorganic matter 3areflectance 3arumen 3aseeds 3aspectroscopy 3astarch 2aAnimal Feed 2aAnimal Nutritional Physiological Phenomena 2aAnimals 2aCattle 2aDietary Proteinsxanalysisxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aEnergy Metabolism 2aKinetics 2aMolecular Structure 2aProtein Structure, Secondary 2aRumenxmetabolism 2aSeasons 2aSpectroscopy, Fourier Transform Infraredxmethods 2aStarchxmetabolism 2aZea maysxchemistry 3aCanada 0aforage 0aprotein molecular structure 0ametabolic characteristics 0aenergy1 aChristensen, David A.1 aNiu, Zhiyuan1 aTheodoridou, Katerina1 aYu, Peiqiang0 tJournal of dairy science.g2013 Oct., v. 96, no. 10 p.6631-6643dElsevier Inc.aAmerican Dairy Science AssociationwJournal:jnl45500x0022-03027nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3168/jds.2013-68413Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03517naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245017100167300001600338500001500354520171900369592002802088650004302116650002202159650001702181650001602198650002202214650002702236650002402263650001902287650002202306650002002328650001602348650001002364650001102374650002202385650001902407650003002426650002102456650003402477650003702511650001602548653003602564700002202600700001502622700001802637700001502655700001502670700001802685700001502703700001802718773011302736856008102849852000902930655001202939IND50070737320221121051943.0150210e201312  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007073732DNAL7 a10.1007/s11240-013-0366-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Teng Guo10aMolecular cloning and characterization of the mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase gene (MKK4) and its promoter sequence from oilseed rape (Brassica campestris L.)  ap. 341-353.  a2019-12-04  aMitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascades are involved in various processes, including plant growth and development as well as biotic and abiotic stress responses. MAPK kinases (MKKs), which link MPKs and MAPKK kinases (MKKKs), are crucial in MAPK cascades because these kinases mediate various stress responses in plants. However, only few MKKs in Brassica campestris (rape) have been functionally characterized. In this study, a novel gene, MKK4 that belongs to a C MKK group, was isolated and characterized from rape. Bioinformatics analysis revealed that the length of cDNA was 1,317 bp with an open reading frame of 993 bp, which encodes a polypeptide containing 330 amino acids, including a putative signal peptide with 27 amino acid residues and a mature protein with 303 amino acids. The obtained MKK4 exhibited a predicted molecular mass of 36.5 kDa and an isoelectric point of 9.01. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction analysis revealed that MKK4 expression could be induced by cold and salt. We also found that the MKK4 protein is localized in the nucleus. In addition, a 999 bp promoter fragment of MKK4 was cloned. Sequence analysis revealed that several putative regulatory elements were found in the MKK4 promoter. Transient expression assay showed that the MKK4 promoter fragments exhibited promoter activity and stimulated GFP expression. The effects of GFP gene expression at different temperatures and in different onion epidermis culture patterns were compared. Results showed that the MKK4 promoter could respond to low temperature and salt stress. These results suggested that MKK4 is possibly important for the regulation of cold- and salt-stress responses in plants.  aPublisher supplied data 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3asequence analysis 3aplant growth 3atemperature 3acomplementary DNA 3agrowth and development 3aopen reading frames 3abioinformatics 3aisoelectric point 3agene expression 3aamino acids 3agenes 3aonions 3amolecular cloning 3asignal peptide 3aBrassica napus var. napus 3amolecular weight 3aBrassica rapa subsp. oleifera 3amitogen-activated protein kinase 3asalt stress 0aBrassica rapa subsp. campestris1 aChen, Qiong Qiong1 aWang, Ning1 aXia, Xiao Hui1 aWang, Juan1 aChang, Yan1 aYang, Ying Li1 aYang, Ning1 aSun, Wan Cang0 tPlant cell, tissue, and organ culture.g2013 Dec., v. 115, no. 3 p.341-353dSpringer-Verlagx0167-68577nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11240-013-0366-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03679naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001700152245016300169300001600332520211800348592002802466650001302494650001602507650002602523650001102549650001002560650001302570650001302583650001102596650002202607650002602629650001202655650001602667650003102683653004402714653003102758653001402789653001402803653001202817700001202829700001702841700001502858700001702873700001302890700001402903700001702917700001702934773010302951856008603054852000903140655001203149IND60634837920221120041405.0190326e201805  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063483792DNAL7 a10.1016/j.atmosenv.2018.02.0312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSartelet, K.10aEmission of intermediate, semi and low volatile organic compounds from traffic and their impact on secondary organic aerosol concentrations over Greater Paris  ap. 126-137.  aExhaust particle emissions are mostly made of black carbon and/or organic compounds, with some of these organic compounds existing in both the gas and particle phases. Although emissions of volatile organic compounds (VOC) are usually measured at the exhaust, emissions in the gas phase of lower volatility compounds (POAvapor) are not. However, these gas-phase emissions may be oxidised after emission and enhance the formation of secondary organic aerosols (SOA). They are shown here to contribute to most of the SOA formation in Central Paris. POAvapor emissions are usually estimated from primary organic aerosol emissions in the particle phase (POA). However, they could also be estimated from VOC emissions for both gasoline and diesel vehicles using previously published measurements from chamber measurements. Estimating POAvapor from VOC emissions and ageing exhaust emissions with a simple model included in the Polyphemus air-quality platform compare well to measurements of SOA formation performed in chamber experiments. Over Greater Paris, POAvapor emissions estimated using POA and VOC emissions are compared using the HEAVEN bottom-up traffic emissions model. The impact on the simulated atmospheric concentrations is then assessed using the Polyphemus/Polair3D chemistry-transport model. Estimating POAvapor emissions from VOC emissions rather than POA emissions lead to lower emissions along motorway axes (between −50% and −70%) and larger emissions in urban areas (up to between +120% and +140% in Central Paris). The impact on total organic aerosol concentrations (gas plus particle) is lower than the impact on emissions: between −8% and 25% along motorway axes and in urban areas respectively. Particle-phase organic concentrations are lower when POAvapor emissions are estimated from VOC than POA emissions, even in Central Paris where the total organic aerosol concentration is higher, because of different assumptions on the emission volatility distribution, stressing the importance of characterizing not only the emission strength, but also the emission volatility distribution.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaerosols 3aair quality 3aatmospheric chemistry 3acarbon 3agases 3agasoline 3ahighways 3amodels 3aorganic compounds 3aparticulate emissions 3atraffic 3aurban areas 3avolatile organic compounds 0aIntermediate volatile organic compounds 0aSecondary organic aerosols 0aParticles 0aEmissions 0aTraffic1 aZhu, S.1 aMoukhtar, S.1 aAndré, M.1 aAndré, J.M.1 aGros, V.1 aFavez, O.1 aBrasseur, A.1 aRedaelli, M.0 tAtmospheric environment.g2018 May, v. 180 p.126-137dElsevier LtdwJournal:12031x1352-23107nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.atmosenv.2018.02.0313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03372naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003600113040001800149100002100167245010000188300001400288500001500302520157500317592002801892650001501920650001301935650001401948650002401962650000801986650000901994650002902003650002202032650001302054650002502067650001002092650003002102650004502132650002102177650003202198650003502230650001102265650001102276650000902287650002302296650001402319650002602333650002602359650002802385650003602413653001002449700002402459700001302483700001802496700001902514700001802533700002602551773007802577856008202655852000902737655001202746IND60098991320221119210735.0141105e20121001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009899132DNAL7 a228200792pmid7 a10.1016/j.gene.2012.06.0962doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMarkljung, Ellen10aNovel mutations in the MNX1 gene in two families with Currarino syndrome and variable phenotype  ap. 50-53.  a2019-12-06  aThe Currarino syndrome (CS) consists of a sacral defect, an anorectal malformation and a pre-sacral mass. It manifests as an autosomal dominant congenital malformation in familial settings, with varying penetrance. The disease-causing gene, Motor neuron and pancreas homeobox-1 (MNX1), is known to be mutated in almost all familial cases, but due to the lack of genotype–phenotype correlation, there is a need for better clinical and molecular genetic characterization of the CS. Here, we report two novel mutations in the MNX1 gene in two cases. Each case was found to be familial upon further investigation of the other members of each family. The first affected case (a one year old boy) exhibited a missense mutation, p.Phe289Ser, in exon 3 in the highly conserved third helix of the homeodomain, which is considered to affect the DNA binding property and transcription regulation of the protein. The mutation seemed to display full penetrance of the disease in this family, but with different time of on-set. The second affected case (a 5months old boy) displayed a 13 basepair insertion in exon 1, creating a complex frameshift mutation which results in a premature truncation of the protein that lacks the third helix homeodomain. Other members of the boy's family, who harbored the same mutation, were found to be completely asymptomatic. In conclusion, we detected two novel mutations in the MNX1 gene in cases with CS, which supports mutational analysis in the diagnosis of CS, even though the variability in the genotype and phenotype correlation maintains.  aPublisher supplied data 3apenetrance 3apancreas 3aphenotype 3aframeshift mutation 3aDNA 3aboys 3acongenital abnormalities 3amissense mutation 3agenotype 3aabnormal development 3aexons 2aAnal Canalxabnormalities 2aDigestive System Abnormalitiesxgenetics 2aGenes, Homeobox. 2aGenetic Association Studies 2aHomeodomain Proteinsxgenetics 2aHumans 2aInfant 2aMale 2aMutation, Missense 2aPhenotype 2aRectumxabnormalities 2aSacrumxabnormalities 2aSyringomyeliaxgenetics 2aTranscription Factorsxgenetics 0agenes1 aAdamović, Tatjana,1 aCao, Jia1 aNaji, Hussein1 aKaiser, Sylvie1 aWester, Tomas1 aNordenskjöld, Agneta0 tGene.g2012 Oct. 1, v. 507, no. 1 p.50-53dElsevier B.V.x0378-11197nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gene.2012.06.0963Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01449naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001600149245012100165300001800286500002900304520039300333592002800726650001200754650001600766650001500782650001400797700001400811700001800825700001400843700005400857773012000911856008301031852000901114655001201123IND60733006620221118034408.0210402e20210312xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073300662DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.orglett.1c004062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYu, Wangzhi10aPalladium-Catalyzed Linear Hydrothiocarbonylation of Unactivated Terminal Alkenes: Synthesis of Aliphatic Thioesters  ap. 2482-2487.  aNALT-AP-4-rerunAP2-fuzzy  aA Pd-catalyzed hydrothiocarbonylation of unactivated terminal alkenes is presented.

Geotechnical engineering has long recognized that the moisture variation triggers the expansive nature of soils resulting in its swell and shrinkage. Numerous stabilizing additives have been used to treat expansive soils such as lime, cement and fly ash. However, the use of bio-enzymes as a soil stabilizing agent is not currently fully understood. This study examines the durability performance of the enzymatic stabilization of expansive soils in road pavements subjected to moisture fluctuation. Number of experiments was performed under controlled conditions to investigate the mechanical and hydraulic response of stabilized soils subjected to cyclic moisture degradation at various initial moisture contents covering practical moisture ranges in applicable with road pavements. Results showed that strength of stabilized soils was considerably increased with the addition of enzyme based stabilizer, revealing its ability to maintain the material stiffness over moisture fluctuation. While wetting and drying tests had damaging effects on the UCS, enzyme based stabilization served to preserve soil strength effectively throughout the loading cycles. Results obtained from the mechanical/hydraulics tests were further elaborated using imaging analysis which provides an insight into the mechanism of enzyme based stabilization and the influence of moisture when using this novel stabilization approach. This research will substantially benefit geotechnical applications including cost-effective and sustainable road constructions.  aPublisher supplied data 0aSoil stabilization 0aEnzyme 0aExpansive soil 0aMoisture damage 0aDurability 0aRoad pavements1 aGiustozzi, F.1 aRobert, D.1 aSetunge, S.1 aO'Donnell, B.0 tTransportation geotechnics.g2019 Dec., v. 21 p.100255-dElsevier LtdwJournal:26931x2214-39127nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.trgeo.2019.1002553Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02552naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100001800166245005400184300001600238520154300254592002801797653002701825653001901852653001701871653001701888653001201905653001301917700002201930700001801952700002101970773013201991856008202123852000902205655001202214IND60517598220221119094912.0190730e201511  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051759822DNAL7 a265374032pmid7 a10.1017/S00335835150000862doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLee, Jae Kyoo10aAcceleration of reaction in charged microdroplets  ap. 437-444.  aUsing high-resolution mass spectrometry, we have studied the synthesis of isoquinoline in a charged electrospray droplet and the complexation between cytochrome c and maltose in a fused droplet to investigate the feasibility of droplets to drive reactions (both covalent and noncovalent interactions) at a faster rate than that observed in conventional bulk solution. In both the cases we found marked acceleration of reaction, by a factor of a million or more in the former and a factor of a thousand or more in the latter. We believe that carrying out reactions in microdroplets (about 1–15 μm in diameter corresponding to 0·5 pl – 2 nl) is a general method for increasing reaction rates. The mechanism is not presently established but droplet evaporation and droplet confinement of reagents appear to be two important factors among others. In the case of fused water droplets, evaporation has been shown to be almost negligible during the flight time from where droplet fusion occurs and the droplets enter the heated capillary inlet of the mass spectrometer. This suggests that (1) evaporation is not responsible for the acceleration process in aqueous droplet fusion and (2) the droplet–air interface may play a significant role in accelerating the reaction. We argue that this ‘microdroplet chemistry’ could be a remarkable alternative to accelerate slow and difficult reactions, and in conjunction with mass spectrometry, it may provide a new arena to study chemical and biochemical reactions in a confined environment.  aPublisher supplied data 0aElectospray ionization 0adroplet fusion 0aisoquinoline 0acytochrome c 0amaltose 0akinetics1 aBanerjee, Shibdas1 aNam, Hong Gil1 aZare, Richard N.0 tQuarterly reviews of biophysics.g2015 Nov., v. 48, no. 4 p.437-444dCambridge University PresswJournal:23128x1469-89947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S00335835150000863Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03832naa a2200637 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003100113040001800144100001800162245010500180300001800285500001500303520188400318592002802202650001902230650001602249650001602265650002002281650001702301650002002318650001102338650001202349650001802361650003102379650002402410650000902434650001202443650003102455650002302486650001302509650001102522650002402533650001402557650006802571650002702639650003002666650002102696650003702717650001402754650002002768653001102788653001802799653001402817653001302831653004702844700002002891700001502911700001502926773015402941856007803095852000903173655001203182IND60083506120221121030948.0190318e201310  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008350612DNAL7 a239580002pmid7 a10.3168/jds.2013-65522doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSilva, J.V.C.10aTransport phenomena in a model cheese: The influence of the charge and shape of solutes on diffusion  ap. 6186-6198.  a2019-12-06  aDuring cheese ripening, microorganisms grow as immobilized colonies, metabolizing substrates present in the matrix and generating products from enzymatic reactions. Local factors that limit the rates of diffusion, either within the general cheese matrix or near the colonies, may influence the metabolic activity of the bacteria during ripening, affecting the final quality of the cheese. The objective of this study was to determine the diffusion coefficients of solutes as a function of their different physicochemical characteristics (size, charge, and shape) in an ultrafiltrate (UF) model cheese (based on ultrafiltered milk) to enable better understanding of the ripening mechanisms. Diffusion coefficients of fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-dextrans (4kDa to 2MDa) and FITC-labeled dairy proteins (α-lactalbumin, β-lactoglobulin, and BSA) were measured using the technique of fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP). This study showed that macromolecules up to 2MDa and proteins could diffuse through the UF model cheese. The larger FITC-dextrans were not more hindered by the structure of the UF model cheese compared with the smaller ones. Any decrease in the diffusion coefficients of solutes was related only to their hydrodynamic radii. The FITC-dextran diffusion data were fitted to an obstruction model, resulting in a constant obstruction factor (k ~0.42). Diffusion in the model cheese was sensitive to the physicochemical characteristics of the solute. The FITC-dairy proteins studied (rigid and negatively charged molecules) were hindered to a greater degree than the FITC-dextrans (flexible and charge-neutral molecules) in the UF model cheese. The existence of steric and electrostatic interactions between the protein matrix of the UF model cheese and the FITC-dairy proteins could explain the decrease in diffusion compared with FITC-dextrans.  aPublisher supplied data 3aphotobleaching 3afluorescein 3alactalbumin 3aultrafiltration 3afluorescence 3acheese ripening 3amodels 3acheeses 3ahydrodynamics 3aphysicochemical properties 3aenzymatic reactions 3amilk 3asolutes 3aelectrostatic interactions 3abeta-lactoglobulin 3abacteria 2aCheese 2aDextransxchemistry 2aDiffusion 2aFluorescein-5-isothiocyanatexanalogs & derivativesxchemistry. 2aLactalbuminxchemistry 2aLactoglobulinsxchemistry 2aModels, Chemical 2aSerum Albumin, Bovinexchemistry 2aSolutions 2aUltrafiltration 0acheese 0adairy protein 0adiffusion 0amodeling 0afluorescence recovery after photobleaching1 aPeixoto, P.D.S.1 aLortal, S.1 aFloury, J.0 tJournal of dairy science.g2013 Oct., v. 96, no. 10 p.6186-6198dElsevier Inc.aAmerican Dairy Science AssociationwJournal:jnl45500x0022-03027nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3168/jds.2013-65523Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02881naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003600113040001800149100001400167245008600181300001400267520157900281592002801860650001201888650001401900650001401914650002201928650001101950650000901961650002701970650001201997650001202009650002302021650002502044650002202069650001102091650001102102650003702113650003102150650003402181700002302215700001602238773007802254856008202332852000902414655001202423IND60098991520221119210722.0141105e20121001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009899152DNAL7 a227961302pmid7 a10.1016/j.gene.2012.07.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOhadi, M.10aEvolutionary trend of exceptionally long human core promoter short tandem repeats  ap. 61-67.  aShort tandem repeats (STRs) are variable elements that play a significant role in genome evolution by creating and maintaining quantitative genetic variation. Because of their proximity to the +1 transcription start site (TSS) and polymorphic nature, core promoter STRs may be considered a novel source of variation across species. In a genome-scale analysis of the entire human protein-coding genes annotated in the GeneCards database (19,927), we analyze the prevalence and repeat numbers of different classes of core promoter STRs in the interval between −120 and +1 to the TSS. We also analyze the evolutionary trend of exceptionally long core promoter STRs of ≥6-repeats. 133 genes (~2%) had core promoter STRs of ≥6-repeats. In the majority of those genes, the STR motifs were found to be conserved across evolution. Di-nucleotide repeats had the highest representation in the human core promoter long STRs (72 genes). Tri- (52 genes), tetra-, penta-, and hexa-nucleotide STRs (9 genes) were also present in the descending prevalence. The majority of those genes (84 genes) revealed directional expansion of core promoter STRs from mouse to human. However, in a number of genes, the difference in average allele size across species was sufficiently small that there might be a constraint on the evolution of average allele size. Random drift of STRs from mouse to human was also observed in a minority of genes. Future work on the genes listed in the current study may further our knowledge into the potential importance of core promoter STRs in human evolution.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalleles 3adatabases 3aevolution 3agenetic variation 3ahumans 3amice 3amicrosatellite repeats 2aAlleles 2aAnimals 2aDatabases, Genetic 2aEvolution, Molecular 2aGenetic Variation 2aGenome 2aHumans 2aMicrosatellite Repeatsxgenetics 2aPromoter Regions, Genetic. 2aTranscription Initiation Site1 aMohammadparast, S.1 aDarvish, H.0 tGene.g2012 Oct. 1, v. 507, no. 1 p.61-67dElsevier B.V.x0378-11197nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gene.2012.07.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04345naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002200094024001900116024003500135040001800170100006200188245016200250300001200412500001100424506007600435520239900511592002802910506003702938650002102975650001202996650003003008650001103038650002303049650001403072650001003086650002903096650001803125650001303143650001103156650001503167650001903182650001603201650001503217650001403232650001303246650001203259650002603271650001903297651001303316651003703329651002203366651001203388651001003400700001903410700001803429700001803447700002303465700002003488773010803508856008203616852000903698655001203707IND60572295320221207065852.0220818e201712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057229532DNAL7 aPMC53825142pmcid7 a283812792pmid7 a10.1186/s13071-017-2103-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKelly-Hope, Louise1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3330-762910aLoa loa vectors Chrysops spp.: perspectives on research, distribution, bionomics, and implications for elimination of lymphatic filariasis and onchocerciasis  ap. 172.  aReview  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: Loiasis is a filarial disease caused Loa loa. The main vectors are Chrysops silacea and C. dimidiata which are confined to the tropical rainforests of Central and West Africa. Loiasis is a mild disease, but individuals with high microfilaria loads may suffer from severe adverse events if treated with ivermectin during mass drug administration campaigns for the elimination of lymphatic filariasis and onchocerciasis. This poses significant challenges for elimination programmes and alternative interventions are required in L. loa co-endemic areas. The control of Chrysops has not been considered as a viable cost-effective intervention; we reviewed the current knowledge of Chrysops vectors to assess the potential for control as well as identified areas for future research. RESULTS: We identified 89 primary published documents on the two main L. loa vectors C. silacea and C dimidiata. These were collated into a database summarising the publication, field and laboratory procedures, species distributions, ecology, habitats and methods of vector control. The majority of articles were from the 1950–1960s. Field studies conducted in Cameroon, Democratic Republic of Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Nigeria and Sudan highlighted that C. silacea is the most important and widespread vector. This species breeds in muddy streams or swampy areas of forests or plantations, descends from forest canopies to feed on humans during the day, is more readily adapted to human dwellings and attracted to wood fires. Main vector targeted measures proposed to impact on L. loa transmission included personal repellents, household screening, indoor residual spraying, community-based environmental management, adulticiding and larviciding. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first comprehensive review of the major L. loa vectors for several decades. It highlights key vector transmission characteristics that may be targeted for vector control providing insights into the potential for integrated vector management, with multiple diseases being targeted simultaneously, with shared human and financial resources and multiple impact. Integrated vector management programmes for filarial infections, especially in low transmission areas of onchocerciasis, require innovative approaches and alternative strategies if the elimination targets established by the World Health Organization are to be achieved.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aChrysops silacea 3aLoa loa 3aWorld Health Organization 3abreeds 3acost effectiveness 3adatabases 3adrugs 3aenvironmental management 3aforest canopy 3ahabitats 3ahumans 3aivermectin 3aonchocerciasis 3aplantations 3arepellents 3ascreening 3aspraying 3astreams 3atropical rain forests 3avector control 3aCameroon 3aDemocratic Republic of the Congo 3aEquatorial Guinea 3aNigeria 3aSudan1 aPaulo, Rossely1 aThomas, Brent1 aBrito, Miguel1 aUnnasch, Thomas R.1 aMolyneux, David0 tParasites & vectors.g2017 Dec., v. 10, no. 1 p.172-172dBioMed CentralwJournal:24143x1756-33057nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13071-017-2103-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01923naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100001800166245007200184300001600256520101200272592002801284653003001312653002401342653003501366653002101401773013201422856008201554852000901636655001201645IND60517598320221119094855.0190730e201511  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051759832DNAL7 a265374042pmid7 a10.1017/S00335835150000982doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKuroda, Reiko12aA twisting story: how a single gene twists a snail? Mechanogenetics  ap. 445-452.  aLeft–right (l–r) symmetry breaking and the establishment of asymmetric animal body plan during embryonic development are fundamental questions in nature. The molecular basis of l–r symmetry breaking of snails is a fascinating topic as it is determined by a maternal single handedness-determining locus at a very early developmental stage. This perspective describes the current state of the art of the chiromorphogenesis, mainly based on our own work, i.e. the first step of l–r symmetry breaking, as proven by our “Mechanogenetics”, before the start of zygotic gene expression, transfer of chirality information to the cell-fate determining stage, and the expression of nodal at the blastula stage. The Nodal signalling pathway is a common mechanism in vertebrates’ chiromorphogenesis in later development. Studies on snails, especially Lymnaea (L.) stagnalis, shall give important insights into the molecular basis of chiromorphogenesis not only in Lophotrochozoa but in vertebrates as well.  aPublisher supplied data 0aChirality chiromorphology 0aleft-right symmetry 0abreaking developmental biology 0asnail handedness0 tQuarterly reviews of biophysics.g2015 Nov., v. 48, no. 4 p.445-452dCambridge University PresswJournal:23128x1469-89947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S00335835150000983Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02007naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002100149245010100170520090000271592002801171650001101199650001101210650001301221650002201234651001001256653001901266653002001285653002201305653002301327653002701350653001001377653001901387700002201406700001801428773009401446856008401540852000901624655001201633IND60682320220221116164233.0200523e202003  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068232022DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enpol.2020.1112882doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aO'Sullivan, Kate10aUneven energy transitions: Understanding continued energy peripheralization in rural communities  aThis paper problematizes the uneven nature of low carbon energy transitions in the context of uneven geographical development and core/periphery asymmetries. It explores the impacts of transition for peripheral communities lacking political power and agglomerative advantages. While decentralised developments that emerge with energy transition promise to bring new opportunities to remote areas, factors of economic and political inequalities render those opportunities socially and spatially segregated. Exploring experiences of rural and exurban communities in South Wales, the paper establishes links between low carbon transition and its actually existing implications on the ground. It demonstrates that even if having an abundance of natural resource and physical space to harness low carbon energy, many rural communities are trapped in the chronic positions of energy peripheralization.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon 3aenergy 3apolitics 3arural communities 3aWales 0aEnergy justice 0aSpatial justice 0aEnergy transition 0aUneven development 0aEnergy vulnerabilities 0aWales 0aUnited Kingdom1 aGolubchikov, Oleg1 aMehmood, Abid0 tEnergy policy.g2020 Mar., v. 138 p.111288-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12439x0301-42157nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enpol.2020.1112883Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02480naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100005800150245010400208520121900312592002801531650001101559650001101570650001101581650002001592650002001612651001001632651001801642653002001660653003201680653002901712653002301741700001401764700001601778700003001794700002601824700001701850700001801867773009101885856008501976852000902061655001202070IND60778776120221117054346.0220921e20220901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077877612DNAL7 a10.1016/j.energy.2022.1243042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Xue-Chao1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4431-090010aImbalances in virtual energy transfer network of China and carbon emissions neutrality implications  aIt has been increasingly crucial for China to identify the critical regional transmission of embodied energy and the key sectors it flows, especially aiming toward the carbon emissions neutrality target. However, there are still very limited works that have focused on a similar topic. This study took 31 of the 34 provinces of China as cases, covered all economic sectors, explored the regional and sectoral embodied energy flow patterns and discussed the implications for carbon emissions neutrality. The results reveal that: ⅰ) The current embodied energy network in China is inequitable and imbalanced; ⅱ) Most of the beneficiaries with positive net values of embodied energy import/export are mainly located in the coastal area and the Yangtze River Economic Belt, and only Beijing is in northern China; ⅲ) Megacities increasingly rely on the upstream regions in terms of energy supply, transferring significant environmental pressure to other regions; ⅳ) Regional carbon compensation should be seriously considered while making both regional and national carbon emissions neutrality strategies. This study provides a clear version of the regional and sectoral embodied energy network system in China.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon 3acities 3acoasts 3aembodied energy 3aenergy transfer 3aChina 3aYangtze River 0aEmbodied energy 0aCarbon emissions neutrality 0aEnvironmental footprints 0aInput-output model1 aYang, Lan1 aWang, Yutao1 aKlemeš, Jiří Jaromír,1 aVarbanov, Petar Sabev1 aOuyang, Xiao1 aDong, Xiaobin0 tEnergy.g2022 Sept. 01, v. 254 p.124304-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12436x0360-54427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2022.1243043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04105naa a2200661 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094024002200124024001900146040001800165100005500183245011300238506007600351520179200427592002802219596003902247596010602286596008202392596003002474596008702504506003702591650001602628650001102644650002302655650001102678650001602689650002802705650003502733650001902768650001302787650001402800650002802814650001502842650001102857650001402868650001702882650000902899650001102908650002402919650001502943650001402958650001902972650001702991650002203008700001703030700001603047700001903063700001403082700001903096700005603115700005503171773012003226856007603346852000903422655001203431IND60645972420221207142405.0190604e20190521xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064597242DNAL7 a10.1155/2019/54029032doi7 aPMC65562782pmcid7 a312401472pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Xiang1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2008-049610aDevelopment of a Sensitive Chemiluminescence Immunoassay for the Quantification of Folic Acid in Human Serum  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aFolic acid (FA) is an important vitamin for human growth, especially for pregnant women. FA deficiency is associated with megaloblastic anemia, neural tube defects, cardiovascular diseases, irritability, diarrhea, and psychiatric disorders. Normally, FA molecules bind to folate-binding protein (FBP) in the serum as complex. Before quantify the FA concentration, a releasing procedure should be conducted. Alkaline condition and tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine (TCEP) are used to release binding FA to freeing state. In this work, a chemiluminescence immunoassay (CLIA) for human serum FA was established by competition model. Streptavidin (SA) was labeled to magnetic beads by an 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide/N-hydroxysuccinimide (EDAC/NHS) method. Activated biotin molecules were labeled to FBP molecules purified from milk. FA was labeled to horseradish peroxidase (HRP) by EDAC to activate the FA molecules. The pretreated samples or standards were added into the reaction tube with biotin-FBP and FA-horseradish peroxidase (HRP), FA in the sample compete with FA-HRP for binding to biotin-FBP, the signal is inversely proportional to the FA concentration. The method established shows good thermostability and performance. The limitation of detection (LOD) is 0.44 ng/mL. The intra-assay coefficient of variation (CV) is 3.6%–7.1%, the interassay CV is 4.2%–7.5%, and the recovery rate is 92.1%–103.5%. Cross reactivity (CR) was remarkably low with aminopterin, folinic acid, and methotrexate. The method shows good correlation with the FA CLIA product from Beckman Coulter; the equation is y = 0.9618x−0.1434 while the R² value is 0.9224. The established method is sensitive, rapid, and accurate which can fully satisfy for the clinical requirement.  aPublisher supplied data  aBE2018621cJiangsu key R&D program  aLITE2018-24cthe national first-class discipline program of Light Industry Technology and Engineering  cthe Collaborative Innovation Center of Jiangsu Modern Industrial Fermentation  a111-2-06cthe 111 Project  cthe Priority Academic Program Development of Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aaminopterin 3aanemia 3abehavior disorders 3abiotin 3ablood serum 3acardiovascular diseases 3achemiluminescence immunoassays 3across reaction 3adiarrhea 3aequations 3afolate-binding proteins 3afolic acid 3ahumans 3amagnetism 3amethotrexate 3amilk 3amodels 3aneural tube defects 3aperoxidase 3aphosphine 3apregnant women 3astreptavidin 3athermal stability1 aZhou, Qiyang1 aZhang, Ting1 aWang, Chunxin,1 aYu, Zheng1 aAhamada, Hadji1 aBai, Zhonghu1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3985-74341 aHuang, Xuan1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3670-98690 tJournal of Analytical Methods in Chemistry (Online).g2019 May 21, v. 2019dHindawiwJournal:26807x2090-88737nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2019/54029033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02188naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100002100166245014200187300001600329520109200345592002801437653002001465653004101485653002401526653002701550653003101577653002201608700002101630773013201651856008201783852000901865655001201874IND60517598420221119095103.0190730e201511  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051759842DNAL7 a265374052pmid7 a10.1017/S00335835150001042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKang, JeenJoo S.12aA sequence-specific DNA binding small molecule triggers the release of immunogenic signals and phagocytosis in a model of B-cell lymphoma  ap. 453-464.  aMeans to cause an immunogenic cell death could lead to significant insight into how cancer escapes immune control. In this study, we screened a library of five pyrrole–imidazole polyamides coding for different DNA sequences in a model of B-cell lymphoma for the upregulation of surface calreticulin, a pro-phagocytosis signal implicated in immunogenic cell death. We found that hairpin polyamide 1 triggers the release of the damage-associated molecular patterns calreticulin, ATP and HMGB1 in a slow necrotic-type cell death. Consistent with this signaling, we observed an increase in the rate of phagocytosis by macrophages after the cancer cells were exposed to polyamide 1. The DNA sequence preference of polyamide 1 is 5′-WGGGTW-3′ (where W = A/T), indicated by the pairing rules and confirmed by the Bind-n-Seq method. The close correspondence of this sequence with the telomere-repeat sequence suggests a potential mechanism of action through ligand binding at the telomere. This study reveals a chemical means to trigger an inflammatory necrotic cell death in cancer cells.  aPublisher supplied data 0aPy-Im Polyamide 0adamage-associated molecular patterns 0anecrotic cell death 0aimmunogenic cell death 0aDNA-binding small molecule 0atelomere sequence1 aDervan, Peter B.0 tQuarterly reviews of biophysics.g2015 Nov., v. 48, no. 4 p.453-464dCambridge University PresswJournal:23128x1469-89947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S00335835150001043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02957naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245012600168520137100294592002801665650002201693650001201715650001301727650001501740650000901755650003701764650001701801650001101818650001801829650001901847650001401866650002001880653001601900653006001916653002301976653002001999700001602019700001702035700001302052700001402065700001602079700001602095700001702111700001502128700001402143700001602157700001802173700001602191773011302207856008602320852000902406655001202415IND60763942920221121084936.0220509e20220515xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076394292DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhazmat.2022.1283012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Panpan10aRemarkable enrichment of heavy metals in baghouse filter dust during direct-fired thermal desorption of contaminated soil  aThis study focuses on the widely applied technology of direct-fired thermal desorption, taking a site contaminated by polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) as a typical test case. The entire thermal desorption process of contaminated soil is considered in the analysis. The concentration levels and occurrence characteristics of heavy metals in dust traditionally considered to be clean are evaluated, and possible secondary pollution and environmental impacts are explored. The results indicate that, compared with the thermal desorption soil, the dust samples generated in the baghouse filter during the ex situ direct-fired thermal desorption process have higher amounts of heavy metal accumulation as well as altered speciation. In addition, the enrichment characteristics and origins of the heavy metals are analyzed according to the process flow and particle size composition as well as the results of X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS), electron probe microanalysis (EPMA), and other microscopic research methods. Phenomenon further reveals enrichment of arsenic (As), nickel (Ni), and chromium (Cr). The findings of this study can provide a scientific basis for the proper disposal and risk management of the dust collected after direct-fired thermal desorption treatment of contaminated soil.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3aarsenic 3achromium 3adesorption 3adust 3aenergy-dispersive X-ray analysis 3aheavy metals 3anickel 3aparticle size 3apolluted soils 3apollution 3arisk management 0aHeavy metal 0aPolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) contaminated site 0aThermal desorption 0aSafe soil reuse1 aCao, Yunzhe1 aLuo, Huilong1 aLi, Ting1 aYang, Bin1 aLi, Huiying1 aLiang, Tian1 aYu, Jingjing1 aWang, Lina1 aMa, Fujun1 aGu, Qingbao1 aDing, Aizhong1 aLi, Fasheng0 tJournal of hazardous materials.g2022 May 15, v. 430 p.128301-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6200x0304-38947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2022.1283013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02353naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100003400152245010800186300001400294520098900308592002801297650002001325650002801345650001701373650001001390650002001400650001201420650001801432650002001450653001601470653002701486653002101513653003101534653002401565700002201589700003701611700002801648700005001676773010901726856008701835852000901922655001201931IND60525665220221118031441.0210312e201602  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052566522DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jfoodeng.2015.10.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 ade Oliveira, Emanuelle Morais12aA computer vision system for coffee beans classification based on computational intelligence techniques  ap. 22-27.  aEvaluating the color of green coffee beans is an important process in defining their quality and market price. This evaluation is normally carried out by visual inspection or using traditional instruments which have some limitations. Thus, the objective of this study was to construct a computer vision system that yields CIE (Commission Internationale d'Eclairage) L*a*b* measurements of green coffee beans and classifies them according to their color. Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) were used as the transformation model and the Bayes classifier was used to classify the coffee beans into four groups: whitish, cane green, green, and bluish-green. The neural networks models achieved a generalization error of 1.15% and the Bayesian classifier was able to classify all samples into their expected classes (100% accuracy). Therefore, the proposed system is effective in classifying variations in the color of green coffee beans and can be used to help growers classify their beans.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBayesian theory 3aartificial intelligence 3acoffee beans 3acolor 3acomputer vision 3agrowers 3amarket prices 3aneural networks 0aCoffee bean 0aComputer vision system 0aBayes classifier 0aArtificial neural networks 0aPattern recognition1 aLeme, Dimas Samid1 aBarbosa, Bruno Henrique Groenner1 aRodarte, Mirian Pereira1 aPereira, Rosemary Gualberto Fonseca Alvarenga0 tJournal of food engineering.g2016 Feb., v. 171 p.22-27dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl34294x0260-87747nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jfoodeng.2015.10.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03100naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002200151245009300173506010400266506007600370520148900446592002801935506003701963650002402000650001602024650001502040650001502055650001602070650001402086650001502100650001402115650001902129650001802148650002802166650001302194650002502207653002002232653002002252653002402272653001802296653002902314700001802343700001702361700002002378773011302398856008602511852000902597655001202606IND60763943020221207051905.0220411e20220505xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076394302DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhazmat.2022.1283022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFiguière, Romain10aRisk-based screening for prioritisation of organic micropollutants in Swedish freshwater  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aConcerns about environmental contamination by organic micropollutants (OMPs) are increasing, due to their potential bioaccumulative and toxic properties. This study evaluated the risk posed by OMPs to aquatic ecosystems in Swedish freshwaters. The assessment was based on measured environmental concentrations (MEC) of OMPs in surface waters upstream and downstream of Swedish wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs). A novel optimised risk quotient (RQf) was used to identify potential high-risk substances in the aquatic environment. A secondary objective was to assess the impact of WWTP effluent on aquatic ecosystems using a novel impact factor (I) based on the risk quotient (RQ). Among the 126 substances investigated, four compounds (metformin, N,N-dimethyltetradecylamine, oxazepam, and venlafaxine) were identified as likely to pose a risk to aquatic ecosystems in Swedish surface waters (RQf>1), and five compounds (clindamycin, gemfibrozil, sertraline, o-desmethylvenlafaxine, and diclofenac) were identified as posing a moderate risk to aquatic ecosystems (0.1 <RQf<1). WWTP effluent appeared to pose an environmental risk for all recipient sites, but the impact of calculated RQ was site-specific. These results can be used by authorities to prioritise OMPs and contaminated hotspots, in order to decrease negative impacts on aquatic ecosystems. A novel optimised risk assessment approach for identification of high-concern organic micropollutants in aquatic environments.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aaquatic environment 3aclindamycin 3adiclofenac 3afreshwater 3agemfibrozil 3ametformin 3apollutants 3apollution 3aprioritization 3arelative risk 3arisk assessment process 3atoxicity 3awastewater treatment 0aRisk assessment 0aPharmaceuticals 0aAquatic environment 0aEcotoxicology 0aEnvironmental monitoring1 aWaara, Sylvia1 aAhrens, Lutz1 aGolovko, Oksana0 tJournal of hazardous materials.g2022 May 05, v. 429 p.128302-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6200x0304-38947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2022.1283023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02178naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100001300112245004200125300001600167506002800183520116800211592002801379506003701407650001301444650002701457650002701484650001401511650001801525650002001543650001801563650001601581653002301597653001601620653001301636700001701649773014101666852000901807655001201816IND60784619920221207120121.0101122e201011  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078461992DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRosa, RD10aAntimicrobial peptides in crustaceans  ap. 262-284.  aResource is Open Access  aCrustaceans are a large and diverse invertebrate animal group that mounts a complex and efficient innate immune response against a variety of microorganisms. The crustacean immune system is primarily related to cellular responses and the production and release of important immune effectors into the hemolymph. Antimicrobial proteins and/or peptides (AMPs) are key components of innate immunity and are widespread in nature, from bacteria to vertebrate animals. In crustaceans, 15 distinct AMP families are currently recognized, although the great majority (14 families) comes from members of the order Decapoda. Crustacean AMPs are generally cationic, gene-encoded molecules that are mainly produced by circulating immune-competent cells (hemocytes) or are derived from unrelated proteins primarily involved in other biological functions. In this review, we tentatively classified the crustacean AMPs into four main groups based on their amino acid composition, structural features and multi-functionality. We also attempted to summarize the current knowledge on their implication both in an efficient response to microbial infections and in crustacean survival.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDecapoda 3aamino acid composition 3aantimicrobial peptides 3ahemocytes 3aimmune system 3ainnate immunity 3ainvertebrates 3avertebrates 0acrustacean defense 0acrustaceans 0adecapods1 aBarracco, MA0 tInvertebrate survival journal.g2010 Nov., v. 7, no. 2 p.262-284dUniversity of Modena and Reggio EmiliawJournal:27775x1824-307X7nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle03834naa a2200613 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100001600171245009200187300001500279500001500294520194500309592002802254650001602282650004302298650002602341650001302367650001502380650000802395650002702403650002102430650001802451650001202469650000902481650002002490650002702510650001502537650002502552650001902577650001302596650001202609650001302621650002502634650004502659650003102704650003802735650002302773650004002796650003602836653006002872700002102932700002002953700001802973700002102991700001703012773011503029856005503144852000903199655001203208IND4484905920221121112524.0120614e201207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND448490592DNAL7 a224524602pmid7 a10.1111/j.1365-2672.2012.05294.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aQuigley, L.12aA comparison of methods used to extract bacterial DNA from raw milk and raw milk cheese  ap. 96-105.  a2019-12-06  aAims: In this study, we compare seven different methods which have been designed or modified to extract total DNA from raw milk and raw milk cheese with a view to its subsequent use for the PCR of bacterial DNA. Materials and Results: Seven extraction methods were employed to extract total DNA from these foods, and their relative success with respect to the yield and purity of the DNA isolated, and its quality as a template for downstream PCR, was compared. Although all of the methods were successful with respect to the extraction of DNA naturally present in cheese, they varied in their relative ability to extract DNA from milk. However, when milk was spiked with a representative Gram‐positive (Listeria monocytogenes EGDe) or Gram‐negative (Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium LT2) bacterium, it was established that all methods successfully extracted DNA which was suitable for subsequent detection by PCR. Conclusions: Of the seven approaches, the PowerFood™ Microbial DNA Isolation kit (MoBio Laboratories Inc.) was found to most consistently extract highly concentrated and pure DNA with a view to its subsequent use for PCR‐based amplification and also facilitated accurate detection by real‐time quantitative PCR. Significance and Impact of the Study: Accurately assessing the bacterial composition of milk and cheese is of great importance to the dairy industry. Increasingly, DNA‐based technologies are being employed to provide an accurate assessment of this microbiota. However, these approaches are dependent on our ability to extract DNA of sufficient yield and purity. This study compares a number of different options and highlights the relative success of these approaches. We also highlight the success of one method to extract DNA from different microbial populations as well as DNA which is suitable for real‐time PCR of microbes of interest, a challenge often encountered by the food industry.  aPublisher supplied data 3acheese milk 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3amicrobial communities 3araw milk 3aextraction 3aDNA 3aSalmonella Typhimurium 3amilk composition 3afood industry 3acheeses 3amilk 3aanalytical kits 3aListeria monocytogenes 3apopulation 3apurification methods 3adairy industry 3abacteria 2aAnimals 2aBacteria 2aCheesexmicrobiology 2aDNA, Bacterialxisolation & purification 2aFood Microbiologyxmethods 2aLiquid-Liquid Extractionxmethods 2aMilkxmicrobiology 2aReal-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction 2aSolid Phase Extractionxmethods 0aSalmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Typhimurium1 aO’Sullivan, O.1 aBeresford, T.P.1 aPaul Ross, R.1 aFitzgerald, G.F.1 aCotter, P.D.0 tJournal of applied microbiology.g2012 July, v. 113, no. 1 p.96-105dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx1364-50727nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2672.2012.05294.x  aDNAL 7aarticle01807naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002300149245013200172520068200304592002800986650002301014650002401037651001601061653000901077653002301086653001601109653002601125653001301151653001201164700002101176700001901197700002401216700001801240773009401258856008401352852000901436655001201445IND60682320620221116164358.0200523e202003  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068232062DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enpol.2020.1112932doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGraziano, Marcello14aThe wider regional benefits of power grids improved resilience through tree-trimming operations evidences from Connecticut, USA  aTree-trimming operations (TTOs) are expensive, yet popular management practices for increasing power-grid reliability.

Carbon doping could improve the photocatalytic activity of g-C₃N₄ in promoting charge separation efficiency, visible-light utilization, etc. In this paper, the g-C₃N₄ (as MC) was modified by barbituric acid (as MCB₀.₀₇) and further treated by reduced graphene oxide (rGO) (as n%GCN) and then applied to inactivate ofloxacin-resistant bacteria (OFLA) under light irradiation at UVA-visible wavelength. The results showed that the n%GCN presented strong photocatalytic activity when the GO mass ratio was 7.5% (as 7.5%GCN). The inactivation efficiencies of OFLA by MC, MCB₀.₀₇, and 7.5%GCN were 5.77 log, 8.48 log, and 8.25 log, respectively, under UVA-visible wavelength (λ > 305 nm), compared to 4.83 log, 5.56 log, and 6.08 log, respectively, within 16 h under visible wavelength (λ > 400 nm). The rGO-doping obviously improved the inactivation efficiency of MCB₀.₀₇ on OFLA under visible wavelength. Furthermore, the photoreactivation and dark repair phenomena of OFLA were examined after MC, MCB₀.₀₇, and 7.5%GCN treatment, respectively, and it was found that all approaches led to permanent damage to OFLA of which the regrowth was not observed after 24–48 h. Based on the quenching test, reactive oxygen species of O₂⁻• and hole (h⁺) exhibited dominant roles in the photocatalytic inactivation of OFLA, which may result in oxidative stress and damage to the cell membrane. This study could shed light on the inactivation of OFLA under visible light radiation by rGO modified g-C₃N₄.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon 3acell membranes 3agraphene oxide 3airradiation 3alight 3anitrides 3aoxidative stress 3aphotocatalysis 3aphotoreactivation 3apollution 3areactive oxygen species 3aregrowth 3aresearch 3awater treatment 3awavelengths1 aYin, Xiufeng1 aJiao, Yuzhu1 aSun, Yingxue1 aWang, Chun0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research.g2022 Sept., v. 29, no. 42 p.63142-63154dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl4122550x0944-13447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-022-20326-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03788naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002200094024001900116024003500135040001800170100002600188245014100214300001000355506007600365520206000441592002802501596003502529506003702564650002602601650002402627650002502651650001902676650002202695650001502717650001102732650001202743650001502755650002202770650002102792650001302813650002202826650001402848650001302862650001402875650003002889650001302919650002202932650001302954651001102967651001302978700001802991700001803009773010403027856008203131852000903213655001203222IND60572295720221207071439.0220818e201712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057229572DNAL7 aPMC52098482pmcid7 a280495162pmid7 a10.1186/s13071-016-1935-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDe Silva, Jeremy Ryan10aGenetic clustering and polymorphism of the merozoite surface protein-3 of Plasmodium knowlesi clinical isolates from Peninsular Malaysia  ap. 2.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: The simian malaria parasite Plasmodium knowlesi has been reported to cause significant numbers of human infection in South East Asia. Its merozoite surface protein-3 (MSP3) is a protein that belongs to a multi-gene family of proteins first found in Plasmodium falciparum. Several studies have evaluated the potential of P. falciparum MSP3 as a potential vaccine candidate. However, to date no detailed studies have been carried out on P. knowlesi MSP3 gene (pkmsp3). The present study investigates the genetic diversity, and haplotypes groups of pkmsp3 in P. knowlesi clinical samples from Peninsular Malaysia. METHODS: Blood samples were collected from P. knowlesi malaria patients within a period of 4 years (2008–2012). The pkmsp3 gene of the isolates was amplified via PCR, and subsequently cloned and sequenced. The full length pkmsp3 sequence was divided into Domain A and Domain B. Natural selection, genetic diversity, and haplotypes of pkmsp3 were analysed using MEGA6 and DnaSP ver. 5.10.00 programmes. RESULTS: From 23 samples, 48 pkmsp3 sequences were successfully obtained. At the nucleotide level, 101 synonymous and 238 non-synonymous mutations were observed. Tests of neutrality were not significant for the full length, Domain A or Domain B sequences. However, the dN/dS ratio of Domain B indicates purifying selection for this domain. Analysis of the deduced amino acid sequences revealed 42 different haplotypes. Neighbour Joining phylogenetic tree and haplotype network analyses revealed that the haplotypes clustered into two distinct groups. CONCLUSIONS: A moderate level of genetic diversity was observed in the pkmsp3 and only the C-terminal region (Domain B) appeared to be under purifying selection. The separation of the pkmsp3 into two haplotype groups provides further evidence of the existence of two distinct P. knowlesi types or lineages. Future studies should investigate the diversity of pkmsp3 among P. knowlesi isolates in North Borneo, where large numbers of human knowlesi malaria infection still occur.  aPublisher supplied data  aPG054-2016AcUniversiti Malaya0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aPlasmodium falciparum 3aPlasmodium knowlesi 3aamino acid sequences 3ablood sampling 3agenetic variation 3ahaplotypes 3ahumans 3amalaria 3amerozoites 3amolecular cloning 3amultigene family 3amutation 3anatural selection 3aparasites 3apatients 3aphylogeny 3apolymerase chain reaction 3aproteins 3asequence analysis 3avaccines 3aBorneo 3aMalaysia1 aLau, Yee Ling1 aFong, Mun Yik0 tParasites & vectors.g2017 Dec., v. 10, no. 1 p.2-2dBioMed CentralwJournal:24143x1756-33057nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13071-016-1935-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02748naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002100140245016200161300002000323520159500343592002801938650001401966650000901980650001701989650002202006650005002028650001402078650001402092650001602106700002202122700002302144700002402167773012402191856007402315852000902389655001202398IND60667375620221119235923.0190919e20150304xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066737562DNAL7 a10.1039/c5ra01906k2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTortorella, Sara10aQuantitative structure–property relationship modeling of ruthenium sensitizers for solar cells applications: novel tools for designing promising candidates  ap. 23865-23873.  aTo date, the most common way of screening new potential sensitizers for dye sensitized solar cells is via the traditional time and money consuming trial and error approach. In this study we explore the possibility of extending drug discovery and cheminformatic approaches to the field of material science with the aim of a quantitative structure–property relationship elucidation that could lead to a fast and inexpensive in silico screening of new ruthenium sensitizers for third generation solar cells. Starting from the building of a database of already tested candidates used to train the predictive models, appropriate descriptors extracted from images of 3D molecular interaction fields (GRID/MIFs), as well as semi-empirical calculated descriptors, were chosen to describe the target structures. Then, structure–performance (Jₛc, Vₒc and PCE) models were built and analysed in order to elucidate structure–property relationships and interesting results were obtained. In particular, we were able to find the molecular descriptors that more contribute to enhance the performance investigated, thus finding directives for the design of potentially high-performing candidates. We also proposed an efficient correction of the experimental Jₛc and Vₒc based on the quantity of the LiI additive for electrolyte used to build the devices. In the early stage of this project, we demonstrated that molecular modelling methods could be successfully extended to the field of material science as alternative to the traditional expensive and time-consuming trial and error approach.  aPublisher supplied data 3adatabases 3adyes 3aelectrolytes 3amaterials science 3aquantitative structure-activity relationships 3aruthenium 3ascreening 3asolar cells1 aMarotta, Gabriele1 aCruciani, Gabriele1 aDe Angelis, Filippo0 tRSC advances.g2015 Mar. 04, v. 5, no. 30 p.23865-23873dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c5ra01906k3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02307naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001900148245006300167300001400230520121600244592002801460650002801488650001901516650002301535650001501558650001001573650001201583650001601595650001401611650002601625650002401651650001401675650001901689700002101708773011201729856008301841852000901924655001201933IND60653835420221117080857.0191021e201910  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065383542DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cois.2019.07.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDamien, Maxime10aPrey–predator phenological mismatch under climate change  ap. 60-68.  aInsect phenology is affected by climate change and main responses are driven by phenotypic plasticity and evolutionary changes. Any modification in seasonal activity in one species can have consequences on interacting species, within and among trophic levels. In this overview, we focus on synchronisation mismatches that can occur between tightly interacting species such as hosts and parasitoids or preys and predators. Asynchronies happen because species from different trophic levels can have different response rates to climate change. We show that insect species alter their seasonal activities by modifying their life-cycle through change in voltinism or by altering their development rate. We expect strong bottom–up effects for phenology adjustments rather than top–down effects within food-webs. Extremely complex outcomes arise from such trophic mismatches, which make consequences at the community or ecosystem levels tricky to predict in a climate change context. We explore a set of potential consequences on population dynamics, conservation of species interactions, with a particular focus on the provision of ecosystem services by predators and parasitoids, such as biological pest control.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiological pest control 3aclimate change 3aecosystem services 3aecosystems 3ahosts 3ainsects 3aparasitoids 3aphenology 3aphenotypic plasticity 3apopulation dynamics 3apredators 3atrophic levels1 aTougeron, Kévin0 tCurrent opinion in insect science.g2019 Oct., v. 35 p.60-68dElsevier Inc.wJournal:23301x2214-57457nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cois.2019.07.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02013naa a2200373 u 4500001001100000005001700011008004100028016002100069024003400090040001800124100001800142245009900160300001600259520086900275592002801144650001301172650002601185650002501211650001201236650001301248650002401261653002001285653001701305653002001322653001201342653002601354700001401380700001701394700001501411773011101426856008101537852000901618655001201627IND607934520221120185828.0181018e201206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND60793452DNAL7 a10.1177/00405175114279652doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Jinchun10aDesign and development of polymeric optical fiber jacquard fabric with dynamic pattern display  ap. 967-974.  aInspired by the principle of visual persistence, an innovated design method of preparing polymeric optical fiber jacquard fabric with a dynamic pattern display is put forward. Polymer optical fibers (POFs) as weft threads are interwoven with warp threads on a jacquard loom to produce patterns on the surface of fabric. The application of the figured jacquard computer-aided design system in pattern design and multi-backed construction design makes it possible to create different patterns on the same fabric zone. As a result, designed POF jacquard fabrics are capable of displaying dynamic patterns with high brightness and resolution under circuit control. The fabric not only has a decorative effect just as traditional jacquard fabric, but also has a luminous effect, and can serve as fashionable clothes, portable electronic devices, house decorations, etc.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclothing 3acomputer-aided design 3aelectronic equipment 3afabrics 3apolymers 3asystems engineering 0adynamic display 0aillumination 0ajacquard fabric 0apattern 0apolymer optical fiber1 aYang, Bin1 aHuang, Baohe1 aJin, Zimin0 tTextile research journal.g, v. 82, no. 10 p.967-974dSAGE PublicationswJournal:jnl46536x1746-77487nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1177/00405175114279653Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03905naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002200094024001900116024003500135040001800170100002200188245010000210300001100310506007600321520202800397592002802425596009902453596004502552596009002597506003702687650003202724650001802756650001102774650002102785650001902806650000902825650002302834650001002857650001802867650001102885650002402896650001402920650001402934650000902948650002302957650002202980650001703002650001103019651001603030700002103046700002003067700002003087700002303107773010603130856008203236852000903318655001203327IND60572295820221207071441.0220818e201712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057229582DNAL7 aPMC52255242pmcid7 a280771612pmid7 a10.1186/s13071-016-1951-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOtero-Abad, Belen10aMathematical modelling of Echinococcus multilocularis abundance in foxes in Zurich, Switzerland  ap. 21.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: In Europe, the red fox (Vulpes vulpes) is the main definitive host of Echinococcus multilocularis, the aetiological agent of a severe disease in humans called alveolar echinococcosis. The distribution of this zoonotic parasite among the fox population is remarkably aggregated with few heavily infected animals harbouring much of the parasite burdens and being responsible for most of the environmental parasitic egg contamination. Important research questions explored were: (i) spatial differences in parasite infection pressure related to the level of urbanization; (ii) temporal differences in parasite infection pressure in relation to time of the year; (iii) is herd immunity or an age-dependent infection pressure responsible for the observed parasite abundance; (iv) assuming E. multilocularis infection is a clumped process, how many parasites results from a regular infection insult. METHODS: By developing and comparing different transmission models we characterised the spatio-temporal variation of the infection pressure, in terms of numbers of parasites that foxes acquired after exposure per unit time, in foxes in Zurich (Switzerland). These included the variations in infection pressure with age of fox and season and the possible regulating effect of herd immunity on parasite abundance. RESULTS: The model fitting best to the observed data supported the existence of spatial and seasonal differences in infection pressure and the absence of parasite-induced host immunity. The periodic infection pressure had different amplitudes across urbanization zones with higher peaks during autumn and winter. In addition, the model indicated the existence of variations in infection pressure among age groups in foxes from the periurban zone. CONCLUSIONS: These heterogeneities in infection exposure have strong implications for the implementation of targeted control interventions to lower the intensity of environmental contamination with parasite eggs and, ultimately, the infection risk to humans.  aPublisher supplied data  aCR3313_132482/1cSchweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Förderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung  a1.99.03cSwiss Federal Veterinary Office  aQLK2-CT-2001-001995/BBW No. 00.0586-2cSwiss Federal Office for Education and Science0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aEchinococcus multilocularis 3aVulpes vulpes 3aautumn 3adefinitive hosts 3aechinococcosis 3aeggs 3aetiological agents 3afoxes 3aherd immunity 3ahumans 3amathematical models 3aparasites 3apollution 3arisk 3aseasonal variation 3aspatial variation 3aurbanization 3awinter 3aSwitzerland1 aRüegg, Simon R.1 aHegglin, Daniel1 aDeplazes, Peter1 aTorgerson, Paul R.0 tParasites & vectors.g2017 Dec., v. 10, no. 1 p.21-21dBioMed CentralwJournal:24143x1756-33057nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13071-016-1951-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01826naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001600149245010100165300001800266500001900284520065200303592002800955650001400983650003600997650001401033650001401047700005601061700001801117700005701135700003101192700005301223773012001276856008301396852000901479655001201488IND60733007520221118034537.0210402e20210312xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073300752DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.orglett.1c004642doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Wenkuan12aA Strategy for Amide C–N Bond Activation with Ruthenium Catalyst: Selective Aromatic Acylation  ap. 2521-2526.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aA strategy for amide C–N bond activation with ruthenium catalyst is described for the first time. The in situ formed bis-cycloruthenated complexes were demonstrated to be the key active species with superior oxidative addition ability to an inert amide C–N bond. The direct C–H bond activation of 2-arylpyridines followed by the amide C–N bond activation took place in the presence of a ruthenium precatalyst to produce monoacylation products in moderate to good yields. Synthetically useful functional groups, such as halogen atoms (F and Cl), ester, acetyl, and vinyl, remained intact during tandem C–H/C–N bond activation reactions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacylation 3acarbon-hydrogen bond activation 3acatalysts 3aruthenium1 aZhang, Sheng1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9671-76681 aFeng, Xiujuan1 aYu, Xiaoqiang1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9396-38821 aYamamoto, Y.q(Yoshinori),1 aBao, Ming1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5179-34990 tOrganic letters.g2021 Mar. 12, v. 23, no. 7 p.2521-2526dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19216x1523-70527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.orglett.1c004643Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02903naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003600113040001800149100002000167245012500187300001600312500001500328520104800343592002801391650002201419650001901441650001701460650001501477650002401492650001501516650001401531650000901545650002501554650001001579650001501589650002401604650002801628650001801656650001801674650001101692650002401703650004801727650001701775650001101792650004401803650005701847650000901904650002801913650001401941650003001955651001001985653001001995700001402005700001702019700001802036700001802054700002102072773008102093856008202174852000902256655001202265IND60098992020221119210301.0141105e20121010xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009899202DNAL7 a227507982pmid7 a10.1016/j.gene.2012.06.0642doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Xiao-Ling10aDetection of somatic and germline mosaicism for the LAMP2 gene mutation c.808dupG in a Chinese family with Danon disease  ap. 174-176.  a2019-12-06  aDanon disease is a rare X-linked lysosomal storage disease characterized by hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, myopathy and mental retardation, and is due to a primary defect in lysosome-associated membrane protein-2 (LAMP 2). More than 26 mutations in the LAMP2 gene have been described, including a small number of de novo mutations, some of which are suspected to be caused by germline mosaicism. Here, we describe the first molecularly documented evidence of somatic mosaicism for a LAMP2 mutation, identified in the asymptomatic mother of a boy with Danon disease caused by the frameshift mutation c.808dupG (p.A270Gfx3) within exon 6. In addition, in order to gain insight into the possible explanation for the mother's lack of phenotype, the level of somatic mosaicism and the X-chromosome inactivation pattern were investigated. This study provides new insight into the causes of phenotypic variability in female mutation-carriers and underlines the importance of parental molecular testing for accurate genetic counseling for Danon disease.  aPublisher supplied data 3amuscular diseases 3acardiomyopathy 3aX chromosome 3acounseling 3aframeshift mutation 3agerm cells 3aphenotype 3aboys 3aphenotypic variation 3aexons 2aAdolescent 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aAsian Peoplexgenetics. 2aBase Sequence 2aDNAxgenetics 2aFemale 2aFrameshift Mutation 2aGlycogen Storage Disease Type IIbxgenetics 2aHeterozygote 2aHumans 2aLysosomal-Associated Membrane Protein 2 2aLysosome-Associated Membrane Glycoproteinsxgenetics 2aMale 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aMosaicism 2aX Chromosome Inactivation 0aChina 0agenes1 aZhao, Yan1 aKe, Hai-Ping1 aLiu, Wen-Ting1 aDu, Zhen-Fang1 aZhang, Xian-Ning0 tGene.g2012 Oct. 10, v. 507, no. 2 p.174-176dElsevier B.V.x0378-11197nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gene.2012.06.0643Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03833naa a2200613 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002600111040001800137100002100155245009300176300001600269520165200285592002801937650001201965650001301977650001701990650001802007650001702025650001502042650001502057650004402072650001902116650001302135650001402148650001202162650006302174650005002237650000902287650005502296650004102351650005202392650005602444650005202500650005202552650005802604650005302662650004502715650002202760650005602782650005002838650005102888650003102939700002002970700002202990700002603012700001803038773010303056856003903159852000903198655001203207IND4468604220221120030711.0120418e201205  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446860422DNAL7 a218534962pmid7 a10.1002/pca.13522doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBertelli, Davide10a1H‐NMR Simultaneous Identification of Health‐Relevant Compounds in Propolis Extracts  ap. 260-266.  aINTRODUCTION: Propolis is a resinous substance collected by bees from exudates of different plants that is rich in well‐known health‐relevant phenolic compounds such as flavonoids and phenolic acids. Propolis extracts are very complex matrices difficult to study. Different analytical methods are usable to analyse propolis extracts and to obtain chemical fingerprint but to our knowledge NMR has not previously been used for this purpose. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to demonstrate that it is possible to use 1H‐NMR for the simultaneous recognition of phenolic compounds in complex matrices, such as propolis extracts, using appropriate tools for spectra pre‐treatment and analysis. METHODOLOGY: In this work 12 typical phenolic propolis compounds (apigenin, chrysin, galangin, kaempferol, quercetin, naringenin, pinocembrin, pinostrobin, caffeic acid, cinnamic acid, p‐coumaric acid and ferulic acid) were considered as reference compounds and their presence in samples was verified by HPLC‐MS. A simple 1H‐NMR sequence was used to obtain spectra of samples. Spectra were pre‐treated by using an appropriate tool for spectra alignment and analysed by using software for the study of spectra originated from complex matrices. Sixty‐five propolis samples were used to test the proposed identification procedure. RESULTS: Ten out of 12 considered compounds were identified as statistically significant in most of the samples. CONCLUSION: This work suggests that it is possible to efficiently use 1H‐NMR, coupled with appropriate spectral analytical tools, for the simultaneous detection of phenolic compounds in complex matrices.  aPublisher supplied data 3aApoidea 3aapigenin 3acaffeic acid 3acinnamic acid 3aferulic acid 3akaempferol 3anaringenin 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aplant exudates 3apropolis 3aquercetin 2aAnimals 2aAnti-Infective Agentsxanalysisxisolation & purification. 2aApigeninxanalysisxisolation & purification. 2aBees 2aCaffeic Acidsxanalysisxisolation & purification. 2aChromatography, High Pressure Liquid 2aCinnamatesxanalysisxisolation & purification. 2aCoumaric Acidsxanalysisxisolation & purification. 2aFlavanonesxanalysisxisolation & purification. 2aFlavonoidsxanalysisxisolation & purification. 2aHydroxybenzoatesxanalysisxisolation & purification. 2aKaempferolsxanalysisxisolation & purification. 2aMagnetic Resonance Spectroscopyxmethods 2aMass Spectrometry 2aPlant Extractsxanalysisxisolation & purification. 2aPropolisxanalysisxisolation & purification. 2aQuercetinxanalysisxisolation & purification. 2aReproducibility of Results1 aPapotti, Giulia1 aBortolotti, Laura1 aMarcazzan, Gian Luigi1 aPlessi, Maria0 tPhytochemical analysis.g2012 May, v. 23, no. 3 p.260-266dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltdx0958-03447nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/pca.1352  aDNAL 7aarticle02389naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001300149245009500162520128400257592002801541650001601569650000901585650001501594650000901609650001501618650002201633650001101655650001601666650001201682650001301694651001001707653002601717653001601743653001801759653001001777700001701787773009401804856008401898852000901982655001201991IND60682320920221116164324.0200523e202003  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068232092DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enpol.2020.1112962doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXu, Shuo10aSustainable shifting from coal to gas in North China: An analysis of resident satisfaction  aTo reduce the impact of coal combustion on air quality, the Chinese government has introduced clean heating policies in North China. The government has vigorously promoted the policy of shifting from coal to gas (hereafter the “coal-to-gas” policy). Hebei Province has the largest number of households that have completed the transition from coal to gas. Taking Hebei as a typical area, we construct a resident satisfaction model (RSM) to estimate the effectiveness and sustainability of the “coal-to-gas” policy in North China. We conduct a survey of 6 villages in Hebei Province to provide new evidence on the grassroots implementation effect of the “coal-to-gas” policy and its influencing factors. The results suggest that the overall satisfaction of residents is at a medium level. The influencing factors of resident satisfaction include the heating level, perceived fairness, air quality and subsidy amount, among which residents have the highest satisfaction with the heating level and the lowest satisfaction with the subsidy amount. We also find that resident satisfaction has a significant positive effect on resident trust. Based on the analysis, we propose policy suggestions to further benefit from positive factors and actively manage negative factors.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair quality 3acoal 3acombustion 3aheat 3ahouseholds 3aissues and policy 3amodels 3anatural gas 3asurveys 3avillages 3aChina 0aResident satisfaction 0aCoal-to-gas 0aPolicy effect 0aChina1 aGe, Jianping0 tEnergy policy.g2020 Mar., v. 138 p.111296-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12439x0301-42157nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enpol.2020.1112963Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03283naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100001700137245009300154300001600247506002800263520210100291592002802392506003702420650001902457650001502476650001202491650001102503650001502514650001702529653002202546653002602568653002102594653003902615700001702654700001802671773012702689856007202816852000902888655001202897IND60784620420221207102552.0190712e201903  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078462042DNAL7 a10.32819/0190142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFokin, A.

The probability of transitions between states corresponds to the sum of the effectiveness of insecticides and the parameters of the system of predictors, which will allow to take into account the problem of incompleteness in accordance with the second theorem of Gödel (Gödel incompleteness theorem). One of these problems is the prediction of the dynamics of the number of insects, since it is impossible to construct a predictive model of the dynamics of the total number, based only on the number data, depending on the system level (population, agrocenosis, biocenosis, etc.); to solve this problem, it is necessary to involve the external predictors (modifying and regulating). In this context, it is important the right choice of predictors to obtain an adequate prediction of the behavior of the system at one level or another. Therefore, it is quite possible to use the basic provisions of the factorial dynamics of population theories (parasitic, biocenotic and climatic), the stochastic and the regulation theory of the dynamics of the population, the trophic and biogeocenotic theory of dynamics of populations. It is important to correctly estimate the level of the predictable system and to form the complex of additional predictors that are not its elements, in order to maximize the intensification of the predictive model. Based on the data on the abundance of the population and the effectiveness of the selected measure (chemical protection, biological agent, agrotechnical measure), it is possible to predict the probability of the population transition to a steady depressive state and the multiplicity of application of means for controlling the number of phytophages for its achievement  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aagroecosystems 3abiocenosis 3ainsects 3amodels 3aprediction 3asoil science 0anumber of insects 0aagrocenosis; modeling 0aplant protection 0adepressive state of the population1 aDolya, N.

Polyphenols form an important class of naturally occurring antioxidants, having innumerable biological activities such as anticancer, antifungal, antibacterial, antiviral, antiulcer and anticholesterol, to name a few. Among various polyphenols, gallic acid (3,4,5-trihydroxybenzoic acid), a naturally occurring low molecular weight triphenolic compound, has emerged as a strong antioxidant and an efficient apoptosis inducing agent. Starting from the bioavailability and the biosynthetic pathway of gallic acid, this review includes various in vitro, in vivo and in silico studies providing the mode of action, radical scavenging activity, ability to inhibit lipid peroxidation, maintenance of endogenous defense systems and metal ion chelation by this triphenolic molecule, along with a comprehensive overview of factors responsible for its high antioxidant activity. Gallic acid derivatives have also been found in a number of phytomedicines with diverse biological and pharmacological activities, including radical scavenging, interfering with the cell signaling pathways and apoptosis of cancer cells. The diverse range of applications of this simple polyphenol is due to a fine amalgam between its antioxidant and prooxidant potential. The existing literature on this dual behavior of gallic acid and its derivatives is reviewed here. This is followed by an account of their potential clinical and industrial applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantioxidant activity 3aantioxidants 3aapoptosis 3aatherosclerosis 3abioavailability 3abiochemical pathways 3achelation 3afree radicals 3agallic acid 3aindustrial applications 3alipid peroxidation 3amechanism of action 3amedicinal properties 3amolecular weight 3aneoplasm cells 3aneoplasms 3aoxidative stress 3apolyphenols 3asignal transduction 3atherapeutics1 aSharma, Neha1 aKakkar, Rita0 tRSC advances.g2015 Mar. 18, v. 5, no. 35 p.27540-27557dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c5ra01911g3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02186naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003600113040001800149100002200167245005000189300001600239520110100255592002801356650002201384650002201406650001501428650003501443650001501478650002401493650001501517650001101532650002001543650003601563700002301599700001801622773008101640856008201721852000901803655001201812IND60098992120221119210035.0141105e20121010xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009899212DNAL7 a227767662pmid7 a10.1016/j.gene.2012.06.0322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRamadhani, Samira13aAn improved heuristic for haplotype inference  ap. 177-182.  aHaplotypes include essential SNP information used for a variety of purposes such as investigating potential links between certain diseases and genetic variations. Given a set of genotypes, the haplotype inference problem based on pure parsimony is the problem of finding a minimum set of haplotypes that explains all the given genotypes. The problem is especially important because, while it is fairly inexpensive to obtain genotypes, other approaches to obtaining haplotypes are significantly expensive. There are two types of methods proposed for the problem, namely exact and inexact methods. Existing exact methods guarantee obtaining purely parsimonious solutions but have exponential time-complexities and are not practical for large number or length of genotypes. However, inexact methods are relatively fast but do not always obtain optimum solutions. In this paper, an improved heuristic is proposed, based on which new inexact and exact methods are provided. Experimental results indicate that the proposed methods replace the state-of-the-art inexact and exact methods for the problem.  aPublisher supplied data 3agenetic disorders 3agenetic variation 3ahaplotypes 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism 2aAlgorithms 2aComputer Simulation 2aHaplotypes 2aHumans 2aModels, Genetic 2aPolymorphism, Single Nucleotide1 aMousavi, Sayyed R.1 aTalebi, Majid0 tGene.g2012 Oct. 10, v. 507, no. 2 p.177-182dElsevier B.V.x0378-11197nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gene.2012.06.0323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03189naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094024002200123024001900145040001800164100003000182245009100212300001800303506007600321520159200397592002801989506003702017650002002054650002702074650001802101650001602119650001402135650002502149650002002174650001002194650001502204650001902219650001202238650001202250650002102262650002102283650002902304650002602333650001402359700002402373700002302397700002002420700002502440773012202465856007502587852000902662655001202671IND60118303620221207050731.0141126e20120801xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011830362DNAL7 a10.1128/JB.06709-112doi7 aPMC34165532pmcid7 a226367682pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAnbalagan, Srivishnupriya10aGrowth Phase-Dependent Modulation of Rgg Binding Specificity in Streptococcus pyogenes  ap. 3961-3971.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aStreptococcus pyogenes Rgg is a transcriptional regulator that interacts with the cofactor LacD.1 to control growth phase-dependent expression of genes, including speB, which encodes a secreted cysteine protease. LacD.1 is thought to interact with Rgg when glycolytic intermediates are abundant in a manner that prevents Rgg-mediated activation of speB expression via binding to the promoter region. When the intermediates diminish, LacD.1 dissociates from Rgg and binds to the speB promoter to activate expression. The purpose of this study was to determine if Rgg bound to chromatin during the exponential phase of growth and, if so, to identify the binding sites. Rgg bound to 62 chromosomal sites, as determined by chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled with DNA microarrays. Thirty-eight were within noncoding DNA, including sites upstream of the genes encoding the M protein (M49), serum opacity factor (SOF), fibronectin-binding protein (SfbX49), and a prophage-encoded superantigen, SpeH. Each of these sites contained a promoter that was regulated by Rgg, as determined with transcriptional fusion assays. Purified Rgg also bound to the promoter regions of emm49, sof, and sfbX49 in vitro. Results obtained with a lacD.1 mutant showed that both LacD.1 and Rgg were necessary for the repression of emm49, sof, sfbX49, and speH expression. Overall, the results indicated that the DNA binding specificity of Rgg is responsive to environmental changes in a LacD.1-dependent manner and that Rgg and LacD.1 directly control virulence gene expression in the exponential phase of growth.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDNA microarrays 3aStreptococcus pyogenes 3abinding sites 3ablood serum 3achromatin 3acysteine proteinases 3agene expression 3agenes 3aglycolysis 3aintergenic DNA 3amutants 3aopacity 3aprecipitin tests 3apromoter regions 3atranscription (genetics) 3atranscription factors 3avirulence1 aDmitriev, Alexander1 aMcShan, W.

This is one of the reasons why HDV emissions regulations are becoming more and more stringent worldwide. Following this trend, Europe introduced the Euro VI standard which includes more stringent emission limits for hydrocarbons, PM and NOx, while for the first time a limit for solid PN emissions was set. At the same time increased concern regarding greenhouse gas emissions led to a series of initiatives including HDVs CO2 certification and monitoring with the latest being the submission of a proposal for CO2 emission targets for 2025 and 2030. Despite the general concern, published data regarding Euro VI HDV emissions are scarce, while real-world emission factor measurements of regulated and unregulated pollutants are even more difficult to find. The main objective of this paper is to present real-world diesel Euro VI HDVs emissions of both gaseous pollutants and solid PN. For that reason five HDVs, including four trucks and one bus, were tested on-road under typical driving conditions. A breakdown of the emissions to low, medium, and high speed conditions was also performed with the aim investigating the performance of aftertreatment systems under different speed conditions. All tested vehicles performed better compared to older technology diesel HDVs, thus reflecting the technological improvements introduced over the last years. However, relatively high emissions were observed for some of the pollutants over low speed phases due to reduced effectiveness of the corresponding emission control systems. Calculated emission factors were also compared to existing emission inventories and good correlation was found for NOx, CO2 and solid PN emissions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair pollution 3acarbon dioxide 3acertification 3aemissions factor 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3ahydrocarbons 3ainventories 3amonitoring 3anitrogen oxides 3apollutants 3atrucks 3aEurope 0aEmission factors 0aEuro VI HDVs 0aCO2 emissions 0aNOx emissions 0aSolid PN emissions1 aFontaras, Georgios1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9924-47311 aGiechaskiel, Barouch1 aZacharof, Nikiforos0 tAtmospheric environment.g2019 Mar. 15, v. 201 p.348-359dElsevier LtdwJournal:12031x1352-23107nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.atmosenv.2018.12.0423Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03671naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100001500142245012700157520180300284592002802087596010602115596005002221650004802271650002802319650002502347650002102372650001802393650001602411650001602427650001702443650001502460650002502475650001302500650002002513650003602533650000902569650001202578650001202590650001502602650004302617650002002660650001702680650002102697650005202718651001002770700001402780700001602794700001602810700001902826700001502845700005302860773009502913856007603008852000903084655001203093IND60645973220221118054641.0190604e20190523xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064597322DNAL7 a10.1155/2019/97819142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Bihui10aInhibitory Effect of Lactobacillus plantarum CQPC02 Isolated from Chinese Sichuan Pickles (Paocai) on Constipation in Mice  aSichuan pickles (Paocai) are a traditional Chinese fermented vegetable food that is rich in beneficial microorganisms. In this study, the inhibition of constipation by Lactobacillus plantarum CQPC02 (LP-CQPC02) isolated from Sichuan Paocai was studied by establishing a constipation model of mice using activated carbon. The constipation inhibition effect of LP-CQPC02 was determined by observing the defecation of mice, rate of active carbon propulsion, pathological section observation, serum index, and small intestinal mRNA expression. The results showed that LP-CQPC02 inhibited the decrease in body weight caused by constipation in mice. At the same time, LP-CQPC02 also increased the propulsion rate of activated carbon in the small intestine and shortened the time of discharge for the first black stool. LP-CQPC02 increased gastrin (Gas), motilin (MTL), endothelin (ET), and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) in constipated mice, and it also decreased the level of somatostatin (SS). qPCR results showed that LP-CQPC02 upregulated the expression of c-Kit, stem cell factor (SCF), and glial cell-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) and downregulated the expression of transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily V member 1 (TRPV1) and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) in mice with constipation, and a stronger effect was observed with a high concentration of LP-CQPC02. The experimental results showed that LP-CQPC02 has a stronger constipation inhibitory effect than the commonly used commercial Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus (LB), and the inhibitory effect of LP-CQPC02 on constipation increases with increasing concentration of LP-CQPC02. Therefore, LP-CQPC02 is a high-quality microbial resource with a good constipation inhibition effect and probiotic potential.  aPublisher supplied data  aCXTDX201601040cProgram for Innovation Team Building at Institutions of Higher Education in Chongqing  aKY2015TBZCcChongqing University of Education 3aLactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus 3aLactobacillus plantarum 3aacetylcholinesterase 3aactivated carbon 3aanimal models 3ablood serum 3abody weight 3aconstipation 3adefecation 3afermented vegetables 3agastrins 3agene expression 3ainducible nitric oxide synthase 3amice 3amotilin 3apickles 3aprobiotics 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3asmall intestine 3asomatostatin 3astem cell factor 3atransient receptor potential vanilloid channels 3aChina1 aYang, Xin1 aGuo, Liujin1 aZhang, Jing1 aZhou, Xianrong1 aYi, Ruokun1 aZhao, Xin1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9798-78650 tJournal of food quality.g2019 May 23, v. 2019dHindawiwJournal:jnl10994x0146-94287nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2019/97819143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03481naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100006300145245012800208300001800336520143300354592002801787650000901815650002601824650001301850650001201863650001701875650000901892650000901901650001301910653001701923653001001940653002201950653000901972653001201981653001501993653001302008700001702021700001702038700007102055700002302126700002002149700005602169700006402225700002002289700002002309700002602329700001402355700002602369700002302395700002202418700005502440700001802495700002602513700002402539700006402563773013902627856008002766852000902846655001202855IND60763255020220221000000.0220118e20211223xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076325502DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.est.1c044942doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIsley, Cynthia Faye1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7063-295X10aInternational Analysis of Sources and Human Health Risk Associated with Trace Metal Contaminants in Residential Indoor Dust  ap. 1053-1068.  aPeople spend increasing amounts of time at home, yet the indoor home environment remains understudied in terms of potential exposure to toxic trace metals. We evaluated trace metal (and metalloid) concentrations (As, Cu, Cr, Mn, Ni, Pb, and Zn) and health risks in indoor dust from homes from 35 countries, along with a suite of potentially contributory residential characteristics. The objective was to determine trace metal source inputs and home environment conditions associated with increasing exposure risk across a range of international communities. For all countries, enrichments compared to global crustal values were Zn > Pb > Cu > As > Cr > Ni; with the greatest health risk from Cr, followed by As > Pb > Mn > Cu > Ni > Zn. Three main indoor dust sources were identified, with a Pb–Zn–As factor related to legacy Pb sources, a Zn–Cu factor reflecting building materials, and a Mn factor indicative of natural soil sources. Increasing home age was associated with greater Pb and As concentrations (5.0 and 0.48 mg/kg per year of home age, respectively), as were peeling paint and garden access. Therefore, these factors form important considerations for the development of evidence-based management strategies to reduce potential risks posed by indoor house dust. Recent findings indicate neurocognitive effects from low concentrations of metal exposures; hence, an understanding of the home exposome is vital.  aPublisher supplied data 3adust 3aenvironmental science 3aexposome 3agardens 3ahuman health 3arisk 3asoil 3atoxicity 0atrace metals 0ahomes 0ahuman health risk 0alead 0asources 0aenrichment 0amodeling1 aFry, Kara L.1 aLiu, Xiaochi1 aFilippelli, Gabriel Michael1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3434-59821 aEntwistle, Jane A.1 aMartin, Adam P.1 aKah, Melanie1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8705-92291 aMeza-Figueroa, Diana1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8934-03211 aShukle, John T.1 aJabeen, Khadija1 aFamuyiwa, Abimbola O.1 aWu, Liqin1 aSharifi-Soltani, Neda1 aDoyi, Israel N.

In order to explore how does carbon dioxide emissions reduction influence capacity utilization, this paper proposes a novel method to decompose the total capacity utilization (TCU) rate under carbon dioxide emissions reduction constraints using data envelopment analysis. The TCU rate is decomposed into an equipment utilization rate (EU), low-carbon technology efficiency (CTE), and policy oriented capacity utilization rate (PCU), and four policy orientations are then simulated to investigate the performance of TCU and its components. Three main conclusions are drawn: (1) the TCU rate was basically maintained between 60% and 70%, indicating a serious overcapacity in China. (2) most regions with a higher TCU rate are the well-developed southeast coastal regions, those with lower TCU rates being mainly the central and western regions; (3) the mandatory emission reduction mode is one of the main causes of overcapacity, where the southeastern coastal areas in particular suffer the most severe capacity loss. In comparison, a win-win development mode is the most cost-effective for China, with a relatively small capacity loss. These conclusions could assist policy designers in improving capacity utilization through effective low-carbon policies.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon dioxide 3acoasts 3acost effectiveness 3aemissions 3aequipment 3aissues and policy 3aChina 0aCapacity utilization 0aLow-carbon policy 0aData envelopment analysis(DEA) 0aDirectional distance function(DDF)1 aZhang, Xiaoling1 aNi, Guohua0 tEnergy policy.g2020 Apr., v. 139 p.111299-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12439x0301-42157nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enpol.2020.1112993Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02633naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100002000112245011900132300001400251506002800265520152600293592002801819506003701847650000801884650001201892650002401904650001401928650002201942650001201964650001101976650000901987650002701996651001402023653001802037653004102055653002102096773013302117852000902250655001202259IND60784620720221207102554.0161204e201208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078462072DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJuanda, Bambang10aRancang bangun sistem insentif untuk meningkatkan pendapatan petani, efisiensi penggunaan air dan ketahanan pangan  ap. 83-89.  aResource is Open Access  aIncreasing productivity of rice generally depends on a variety of additional inputs. Various systems are designed for farmers to increase incomes and improve land productivity. SRI method is a potential technology to increase rice production management based on the cultivation of land, plants and water through the empowerment of groups and local knowledge-based eco-friendly activities. The application of SRI method requires a study of innovation adoption and optimal strategies for farmers. This study uses institutional descriptive analysis; LFA (Logical Framework Analysis) and experimental economics. The results showed that (1) The role and focus of government institutions is an increase in production through the application of various technologies. Performance of local institutions have an important a role of cultivation introduction and depends on the active community leader or head of the farmer or P3A Mitra Cai; (2) Incentives system for farmers in the application SRI paddy method is marketing insurance with favorable price, (3) the application of SRI paddy cultivation requires strengthening group farmer and P3A Mitra Cai in regulating water, organic agricultural input and marketing of products through the application of water fee rates (ipair) based on fair remuneration system; and (4) the incentives for farmers to encourage the application of SRI paddy cultivation is the provision compensation if there is a decrease in production.

In vitro, the primosomal proteins (PriA, PriB, and PriC) and Rep are capable of initiating replication from synthetic DNA fork structures, and they have been proposed to catalyze these events when replication is disrupted by certain impediments in vivo. Here, we characterized the role that PriA, PriB, PriC, and Rep have in processing and restoring replication forks following arrest by UV-induced DNA damage. We show that the partial degradation and processing of the arrested replication fork occurs normally in both rep and primosome mutants. In each mutant, the nascent degradation ceases and DNA synthesis initially resumes in a timely manner, but the recovery then stalls in the absence of PriA, PriB, or Rep. The results demonstrate a role for the primosome and Rep helicase in overcoming replication forks arrested by UV-induced damage in vivo and suggest that these proteins are required for the stability and efficiency of the replisome when DNA synthesis resumes but not to initiate de novo replication downstream of the lesion.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDNA 3aDNA damage 3aEscherichia coli 3amutants 3aproteins1 aLandstrom, Allison J.1 aAnderson, Brittany1 aCourcelle, Justin0 tJournal of bacteriology.g2012 Aug. 1, v. 194, no. 15 p.3977-3986dAmerican Society for Microbiologyx0021-91937nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1128/JB.00290-123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03550naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002900152245009800181300001600279520202700295592002802322650001302350650001802363650001602381650001302397650001702410650001502427650001002442650001602452650001102468650005002479650001402529650001502543651001002558653002602568653001502594653001602609653003702625653001102662653001002673700002602683700002202709700002402731700002502755700002702780700002202807773010702829856008702936852000903023655001203032IND60628639820221120063259.0190319e20190315xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062863982DNAL7 a10.1016/j.atmosenv.2018.12.0432doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMahapatra, Parth Sarathi10aAir quality trends of the Kathmandu Valley: A satellite, observation and modeling perspective  ap. 334-347.  aKathmandu is the capital city of Nepal and a ‘hotspot’ of urban air pollution in South Asia. Its bowl-shaped structure (altitude 1300 m above sea level (masl); floor area 340 km2) surrounded by tall mountains provides a unique case study for analyzing pollution trapped by topography and local meteorology. In the absence of long-term in-situ observations, for the first time the columnar aerosol loading trend of the Kathmandu Valley was analyzed using satellite-derived aerosol optical depths (AOD). AOD from MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) onboard Aqua and Terra (3 × 3 km, Level 2) was used during the dry season (November–June) in 2000–2015. Trend analysis of Kathmandu AOD (KAOD) (the Kathmandu Valley AOD (KValAOD) + background AOD (BAOD)) suggested an increase of ∼35% during the study period. To derive the KValAOD trend, BAOD was subtracted from KAOD. The KValAOD trend indicated an increase of ∼50–60% during the study period, based on MODIS Aqua and Terra data. Thereafter, the background contribution only at the valley layer (1300–1400 masl) was determined using Cloud-Aerosol LiDAR and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observation (CALIPSO) profiles, in-situ observation and modeling techniques. The CALIPSO-based analysis indicated that background pollution contributed an additional 20–25% to local pollution. This finding was further supported by short-term in-situ measurements from Dhulikhel (the site where Kathmandu background measurements were taken) and Ratnapark (a Kathmandu city center site). Case studies were conducted using chemical transport models (WRF-STEM and WRF-Chem) to quantify the contribution of background air pollution to the Kathmandu valley pollution. These model results contradicted the satellite and in-situ observation by highly underestimating the Kathmandu Valley pollution levels. Comparison of visibility in Kathmandu with AOD suggests a profound role of BAOD on decreasing long-distance visibility in particular months.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaerosols 3aair pollution 3aair quality 3aaltitude 3acase studies 3adry season 3alidar 3ameteorology 3amodels 3amoderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer 3amountains 3asatellites 3aNepal 0aAerosol optical depth 0aSouth Asia 0aAir quality 0aWeather research and forecasting 0aCities 0aNepal1 aPuppala, Siva Praveen1 aAdhikary, Bhupesh1 aShrestha, Kundan L.1 aDawadi, Durga Prasad1 aPaudel, Shankar Prasad1 aPanday, Arnico K.0 tAtmospheric environment.g2019 Mar. 15, v. 201 p.334-347dElsevier LtdwJournal:12031x1352-23107nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.atmosenv.2018.12.0433Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02681naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245013800170300001600308520102800324592002801352650002001380650001901400650001701419650002101436650001601457650001801473650001701491650001301508650002401521650001501545650001701560650001301577653002001590653000901610653001301619653003301632653002301665653001801688700002501706700002601731700002001757700002301777700002001800700002201820700002101842700002401863700002401887773013401911856008502045852000902130655001202139IND60631020020221119214029.0200424e201809  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063102002DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbabio.2018.03.0182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFiorillo, Marco10aBergamot natural products eradicate cancer stem cells (CSCs) by targeting mevalonate, Rho-GDI-signalling and mitochondrial metabolism  ap. 984-996.  aHere, we show that a 2:1 mixture of Brutieridin and Melitidin, termed “BMF”, has a statin-like properties, which blocks the action of the rate-limiting enzyme for mevalonate biosynthesis, namely HMGR (3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA-reductase). Moreover, our results indicate that BMF functionally inhibits several key characteristics of CSCs. More specifically, BMF effectively i) reduced ALDH activity, ii) blocked mammosphere formation and iii) inhibited the activation of CSC-associated signalling pathways (STAT1/3, Notch and Wnt/beta-catenin) targeting Rho-GDI-signalling. In addition, BMF metabolically inhibited mitochondrial respiration (OXPHOS) and fatty acid oxidation (FAO). Importantly, BMF did not show the same toxic side-effects in normal fibroblasts that were observed with statins. Lastly, we show that high expression of the mRNA species encoding HMGR is associated with poor clinical outcome in breast cancer patients, providing a potential companion diagnostic for BMF-directed personalized therapy.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadverse effects 3abeta oxidation 3abiosynthesis 3abreast neoplasms 3afibroblasts 3amessenger RNA 3amitochondria 3apatients 3asignal transduction 3astem cells 3atherapeutics 3atoxicity 0aCSCs signalling 0aHMGR 0aBergamot 0aMevalonate pathway inhibitor 0aRho-GDI-signalling 0aBreast cancer1 aPeiris-Pagès, Maria1 aSanchez-Alvarez, Rosa1 aBartella, Lucia1 aDi Donna, Leonardo1 aDolce, Vincenza1 aSindona, Giovanni1 aSotgia, Federica1 aCappello, Anna Rita1 aLisanti, Michael P.0 tBiochimica et biophysica acta.g2018 Sept., v. 1859, no. 9 p.984-996dElsevier B.V.aElsevier B.V.wJournal:1927x0005-27287nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbabio.2018.03.0183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01805naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002000149245007900169506002800248520065400276592002800930506003700958650001300995650001401008650002001022650002601042650001001068650001801078650001101096650001801107650000901125700002601134700002701160700002501187700001901212773009601231856008301327852000901410655001201419IND60739989020221207120216.0201112s2020    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073998902DNAL7 a10.1051/bioconf/202026000612doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aElina, Makarova10aUse of computer innovative technologies in improving the dartsmen training  aResource is Open Access  aThe research is focused on studying the possibility of effective use of the dart grip system, the work of the athlete’s hand, to prepare the dartsman for competitions using the MOSAR complex.

In thermally and in solvent annealed films the dimensions of the closest to the substrate cylinders are smaller than both in thicker films and in bulk due to the confinement effect. The related excess of the stretching energy favors a transition to nonbulk perforated lamella morphology in a narrow window of the film thickness, solvent concentration, and annealing temperature. The discussion of the apparent stability/instability of thin film morphologies includes the analysis of molecular architecture, interfacial tensions, and possible influence of dynamic effects.  aPublisher supplied data 3aannealing 3acomposite polymers 3aenergy 3aphase transition 3asolvents 3asurface tension 3atemperature0 tMacromolecules.g2012 Oct. 09, v. 45, no. 19 p.7985-7994dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-58357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fma301487e3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03405naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094024002200132024001900154040001800173100001900191245011600210300001600326506007600342520159200418592002802010506003702038650002802075650003202103650002702135650002102162650002202183650001502205650002902220650001502249650001902264650001102283650002402294650001702318650002302335650002902358650001902387650001502406650001702421650002202438650001302460653002602473653002202499653002702521653002402548653002502572700002902597773011902626856008502745852000902830655001202839IND60631020120221207082543.0200424e201809  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063102012DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbabio.2018.03.0192doi7 aPMC61768612pmcid7 a296308912pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhou, Wenchang10aMembrane plasticity facilitates recognition of the inhibitor oligomycin by the mitochondrial ATP synthase rotor  ap. 789-796.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aEnzymes in the respiratory chain are increasingly seen as potential targets against multi-drug resistance of human pathogens and cancerous cells. However, a detailed understanding of the mechanism and specificity determinants of known inhibitors is still lacking. Oligomycin, for example, has been known to be an inhibitor of the membrane motor of the mitochondrial ATP synthase for over five decades, and yet little is known about its mode of action at the molecular level. In a recent breakthrough, a crystal structure of the S. cerevisiae c-subunit ring with bound oligomycin revealed the inhibitor docked on the outer face of the proton-binding sites, deep into the transmembrane region. However, the structure of the complex was obtained in an organic solvent rather than detergent or a lipid bilayer, and therefore it has been unclear whether this mode of recognition is physiologically relevant. Here, we use molecular dynamics simulations to address this question and gain insights into the mechanism of oligomycin inhibition. Our findings lead us to propose that oligomycin naturally partitions into the lipid/water interface, and that in this environment the inhibitor can indeed bind to any of the c-ring proton-carrying sites that are exposed to the membrane, thereby becoming an integral component of the proton-coordinating network. As the c-ring rotates within the membrane, driven either by downhill proton permeation or ATP hydrolysis, one of the protonated, oligomycin-bound sites eventually reaches the subunit-a interface and halts the rotary mechanism of the enzyme.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aH+/K+-exchanging ATPase 3aH-transporting ATP synthase 3aadenosine triphosphate 3aanimal pathogens 3acrystal structure 3adetergents 3aelectron transport chain 3ahydrolysis 3alipid bilayers 3alipids 3amechanism of action 3amitochondria 3amolecular dynamics 3amultiple drug resistance 3aneoplasm cells 3aoligomycin 3apermeability 3asimulation models 3asolvents 0aMulti-drug resistance 0aRespiratory chain 0aMembrane bioenergetics 0aMembrane plasticity 0aMolecular simulation1 aFaraldo-Gómez, José D.0 tBiochimica et biophysica acta.g2018 Sept., v. 1859, no. 9 p.789-796dElsevier B.V.wJournal:1927x0005-27287nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbabio.2018.03.0193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02510naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100001400112245011800126300001600244506002800260520114100288592002801429506003701457650001301494650002301507650001101530650001701541650002201558650001701580650003501597650001501632650000901647650002001656650001501676650001101691650001601702650002501718653000901743653001801752653001201770653000801782653001601790653001901806653001701825700001801842700001801860773012901878852000902007655001202016IND60739989120221207120204.0210420e201912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073998912DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlian, N.10aUncertainty Analysis of Expected Annual Flood Damage for Flood Risk Assessment (A Case Study: Zayande Roud Basin)  ap. 141-152.  aResource is Open Access  aOne of the most important problems in flood manegment is the damages induced by this phenomenon. Expected annual damage (EAD) is an important index for basin vulnerability against flood. Prediction of flood damages requires the analysis of spatial and temporal risk and must be calculated by the combination of hydrologic, hydraulic and economic models. In this research, the uncertainty was considered in the flood risk analysis. The probability of flood occurrence was calculated by the parabolistic model. By using the river analysis systems software (HEC-RAS) and the geographic information system (GIS) and utilizing the Google-Earth software, the floodplains of Zayande Roud river in Esfahan province were investigated with the return period of 25, 50, 100, 200 and 500 years. The Monte Carlo method was also sed to perform the uncertainty analysis in the proposed method. The logarithmic persion type III was selected as the best distribution of flood. The damage-stage relationship was calculated as well. Based on the uncertinity analysis, the river discharge could be regarded as the major parameter in the uncertainty of EAD.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aInternet 3aMonte Carlo method 3abasins 3acase studies 3acomputer software 3aflood damage 3ageographic information systems 3aprediction 3arisk 3arisk assessment 3ariver flow 3arivers 3auncertainty 3auncertainty analysis 0arisk 0aflood damages 0ahec-ras 0agis 0auncertainty 0akohpaye-seqzie 0azayande roud1 aAhmadi, M.

In the present study, evaluation of endophytic bacteria isolated from Gnetum gnemon, an ethnomedicinal plant was carried out for their plant growth promoting (PGP) activity and antagonistic potential against bacterial wilt pathogen Ralstonia solanacearum. Initially a total of 40 endophytic bacteria were isolated which were clustered into 13 groups based on RFLP and BOX-PCR fingerprinting. These 13 representative isolates belonged to different genera of Bacillus (9), Solibacillus (1), Staphylococcus (2) and Caballeronia (1). Among them, six isolates were positive for production of IAA, the value of which ranged from 11.16 to 27.63 μg mL⁻¹. Phosphate solubilisation in the range of 106.4 to –212.7 μg mL⁻¹ was shown by three isolates. Eight isolates producedammonia, the value of which ranged from 1.3 to 6.1 μmol mL⁻¹. All tested isolates were positive for siderophore production. For extracellular enzyme production, 7 isolates were positive for protease, 8 for cellulase and 10 for amylase production. The isolates were also tested for their antagonistic activity against R. solanacearum in vitro and in planta assay using tomato seedlings. Staphylococcus warneri GL1 showed the highest biocontrol efficacy of 77.67 % followed by Bacillus velezensis GL3 i.e. 70.1 %. R. solanacearum antagonistic isolates were analysed for the presence of antimicrobial peptide biosynthesis genes bmyB, srfAA, fenD and ituC. All the antagonistic isolates showed the presence of all four genes, except the isolate Bacillus velezensis GMC2, where the gene for fengycin synthetase (fenD) was absent. Based on in vitro PGP traits, three isolates Bacillus velezensis GL3, Bacillus atrophaeus GMC1 and Bacillus megaterium GS2 were selected, these three endophytic bacteria individually and their consortia were tested for in planta PGP activities in tomato plants. Application of Bacillus velezensis GL3 alone and consortia of three isolates showed significant improvement in growth parameters such as shoot length, fresh weight and dry weight in a pot experiment. Colonization of endosphere of treated tomato seedlings by the endophytic isolate Bacillus velezensis GL3 was confirmed by visualization of colony morphology and BOX-PCR fingerprinting. Our study highlights the potential of endophytes associated with unexplored plants like G. gnemon for development of bioformulation aimed at enhancing plant growth and bacterial wilt disease control.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacillus atrophaeus 3aBacillus megaterium 3aBacillus velezensis 3aGnetum gnemon 3aRalstonia solanacearum 3aStaphylococcus warneri 3aamylases 3aantimicrobial peptides 3abacterial wilt 3abiological control 3abiosynthesis 3adisease control 3aendo-1,4-beta-glucanase 3aendophytes 3aextracellular enzymes 3agenes 3aphosphates 3aplant growth 3aplant pathogenic bacteria 3aproteinases 3aresearch 3asiderophores 3asolubilization 3atomatoes 0aPlant growth promotion1 aDowarah, Bhaskar1 aBaruah, Pooja Moni1 aBordoloi, Kuntala Sarma1 aKrishnatreya, Debasish B.1 aAgarwala, Niraj0 tMicrobiological research.g2020 Sept., v. 238 p.126503-dElsevier GmbHwJournal:11955x0944-50137nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.micres.2020.1265033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02446naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100005900151245007700210500002200287520087100309592002801180650002801208650002101236650001701257650002001274650001901294650002601313650001501339650001301354653002301367653000901390653002101399653001301420653002601433653002301459700002101482700002501503700005901528700002601587700002101613700002001634700006501654700002201719700002401741773009201765856008601857852000901943655001201952IND60656227620221119193145.0190809e20190801xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065622762DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbpol.2019.1151622doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChmelař, Josef1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5852-292310aBiodegradable free-standing films from lauroyl derivatives of hyaluronan  aPre-press version  aHyaluronan (HA) films exhibit properties suitable for medical applications, but the solubility of HA limits their use in aqueous environments. This can be overcome by modifying HA with hydrophobic side groups that enable physical cross-linking. In this work, we present water insoluble free-standing films from lauroyl modified HA as novel biomaterials with properties tuneable by the degree of HA substitution. The films are homogeneous, mechanically strong, and flexible and can be sterilized by ethylenoxide. To characterize the films, we measured their thickness, dry mass, content of residual organic solvent, mechanical properties, swelling and enzymatic degradation. The safety and biodegradability of the films were tested both in-vitro and in-vivo, showing that the films are safe and that their degradation can be tailored by the degree of HA substitution.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiocompatible materials 3abiodegradability 3acrosslinking 3ahyaluronic acid 3ahydrophobicity 3amechanical properties 3asolubility 3asolvents 0alauroyl hyaluronan 0afilm 0asolution casting 0aswelling 0aenzymatic degradation 0ain-vivo evaluation1 aMrázek, Jiří,1 aHermannová, Martina1 aKubala, Lukáš1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7729-73381 aAmbrožová, Gabriela1 aKocurková, Anna1 aDrmota, Tomáš1 aNešporová, Kristina1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3246-60381 aGrusová, Ludmila1 aVelebný, Vladimír0 tCarbohydrate polymers.g2019 Aug. 01, dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl47819x0144-86177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbpol.2019.1151623Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03332naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002000139245015300159300001800312520168300330592002802013650001202041650002802053650002102081650001802102650001502120650001302135650001102148650002002159650002202179650001702201650001702218650002402235650001502259653003602274653002602310653001902336653003102355653001202386653002402398700002902422700002402451700001802475700001802493700002302511700003002534700003102564773012302595856007502718852000902793655001202802IND60528208720170710000000.0160716e20140423xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052820872DNAL7 a10.1021/am500794q2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSteinhagen, Max10aMatrix Metalloproteinase 9 (MMP-9) Mediated Release of MMP-9 Resistant Stromal Cell-Derived Factor 1α (SDF-1α) from Surface Modified Polymer Films  ap. 5891-5899.  aPreparation of smart materials by coatings of established surfaces with biomolecules will lead to the next generation of functionalized biomaterials. Rejection of implants is still a major problem in medical applications but masking the implant material with protein coatings is a promising approach. These layers not only disguise the material but also equip it with a certain biological function. The anti-inflammatory chemokine stromal cell-derived factor 1α (SDF-1α) is well suited to take over this function, because it efficiently attracts stem cells and promotes their differentiation and proliferation. At least the initial stem cell homing requires the formation of a concentration gradient. Thus, a reliable and robust release mechanism of SDF-1α from the material is essential. Several proteases, most notably matrix metalloproteinases, are upregulated during inflammation, which, in principle, can be exploited for a tightly controlled release of SDF-1α. Herein, we present the covalent immobilization of M-[S4V]-SDF-1α on novel biodegradable polymer films, which consist of heterobifunctional poly(ethylene glycol) and oligolactide-based functionalized macromers. A peptidic linker with a trimeric matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP-9) cleavage site (MCS) was used as connection and the linkage between the three components was achieved by combination of expressed protein ligation and Cu(I) catalyzed azide/alkyne cycloaddition. The MCS was used for MMP-9 mediated release of M-[S4V]-SDF-1α from the biomaterial and the released SDF-1α derivative was biologically active and induced strong cell migration, which demonstrates the great potential of this system.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalkynes 3abiocompatible materials 3abiodegradability 3acell movement 3achemokines 3acoatings 3acopper 3aethylene glycol 3afilms (materials) 3agelatinase B 3ainflammation 3apolyethylene glycol 3astem cells 0aStromal cell-derived factor 1α 0across-linked macromer 0aimmobilization 0amatrix metalloproteinase 9 0arelease 0atissue regeneration1 aHoffmeister, Peter-Georg1 aNordsieck, Karoline1 aHötzel, Rudi1 aBaumann, Lars1 aHacker, Michael

However, genetic kin recognition requires a genetic polymorphism on which recognition is based, and kin discriminating behaviors will affect the evolution of such polymorphism. It is unclear whether genetic polymorphisms used in kin recognition should be maintained by extrinsic selection pressures or not, as opposite conclusions have been reached by analytical one-locus models and simulations exploring different population structures. We analyze a two-locus model in a spatially subdivided population following the island model of dispersal between demes of finite size. We find that in the absence of mutation, selection eliminates polymorphism in most cases, except with extreme spatial structure and low recombination. With mutation, the population may reach a stable limit cycle over which both loci are polymorphic; however, the average frequency of conditional helping can be high only under strong structure and low recombination. Finally, we review evidence for extrinsic selection maintaining polymorphism on which kin recognition is based.  aPublisher supplied data 0aCooperation 0ainclusive fitness 0amultilocus evolution 0aspatial structure1 aRoze, Denis0 tEvolution.g2007 Oct., v. 61, no. 10 p.2320-2330dBlackwell Science Incx1558-56467nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111%2Fj.1558-5646.2007.00191.x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01598naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002800149245008000177300001600257520049100273592002800764650002300792650002300815650002300838650001100861650002200872650001300894700002100907700002200928700002200950700002400972700002000996700002301016773010301039856008501142852000901227655001201236IND60579279620221123032911.0170816e20170106xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057927962DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.orglett.6b034682doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGabriel, Christopher

An extensive investigation on β-galactosidase immobilization by micro-encapsulation on calcium alginate has been carried out to evaluate the optimum process parameters namely sodium alginate to enzyme ratio (SER)22SER – Sodium alginate to enzyme ratio. (100:3) and calcium chloride concentration (0.3M) with an intention to get maximum enzyme loading and retention in activity. Investigations on GOS formation in mechanically agitated batch bioreactor using free enzyme indicate that the overall observed rate can be well explained by conventional Michaelis–Menten model (Km=195.2kgm−3, kcat=5.37min−1). Effects of different operating parameters (temperature, initial substrate concentration) on reaction rate and GOS yield during batch processing have been investigated. Studies on GOS production in packed bed bioreactor using immobilized β-galactosidase indicate that although the observed rate can be well explained by Michaelis–Menten model (K′m=200.2 kg m−3, K′cat=1.39 min−1), enzyme activity is partially blocked due to immobilization.

Black phosphorous quantum dots (BPQDs) possess fascinating electrochemical property and unique photothermal effect, which could not only enhance ECL signal of N-(4-aminobutyl)-N-ethylisoluminol (ABEI) through accelerating dissolved O₂ evolution but also realize temperature signal output by converting laser energy into heat. Furthermore, NiFe₂O₄ nanotubes (NiFe₂O₄ NTs) have large specific surface area and favorable adsorption ability, which could increase the immobilized amount of ABEI and BPQDs, further strengthening ECL and temperature signal. As a result, a dual-mode immunosensor was constructed and realized ECL and temperature dual signal to detect LSR, making the results more reliable. This work provided a new thought for the development of sensitive and accurate sensors and was expected to employ for determination of other biomarkers.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3abiomarkers 3adissolved oxygen 3aelectrochemiluminescence 3aelectrochemistry 3aenergy 3aheat 3aimmunosensors 3alipolysis 3alipoprotein receptors 3ananotubes 3aovarian neoplasms 3aoxygen production 3aphosphorus 3aquantum dots 3atemperature 0aBPQDs 0aNiFe2O4 NTs 0aDual-mode immunosensor 0aECL immunosensor 0aPhotothermal immunosensor 0aLSR1 aLi, Jianing1 aHuang, Defu1 aDai, Hong1 aLin, Yanyu0 tTalanta.g2020 May 01, v. 211 p.120660-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11742x0039-91407nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.talanta.2019.1206603Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02831naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100006100151245014000212500002200352520115800374592002801532650004401560650002001604650001401624650001501638650001901653650001301672650001701685650003801702650001301740650001601753650001701769650001401786650001901800650001901819650001401838650004401852650001301896650002101909650002101930653003001951653002001981653002002001653002202021700006302043700002002106773009202126856008602218852000902304655001202313IND60656227720221119192954.0190815e20190802xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065622772DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbpol.2019.1151632doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHasantabar, Vahid1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7533-894110aFabrication of chitosan based magnetic nanocomposite by click reaction strategy; evaluation of nanometric and Cytotoxic characteristics  aPre-press version  aEfficient procedure for preparation of the novel magnetic nanobiocomposite (MNbC) was successfully established by employing click chemistry protocol.

Promising antiproliferative effects were observed on both epitheloid and mesenchymal cancer cell lines depending on MNbC concentration and time. To detect the apoptosis-associated changes of cell membranes during the process of apoptosis, Acridine Orange/Ethidium Bromide (AO/EB) dual staining fluorescent technique was incorporated. The studies in this article including all of these specifications represent convincing key findings that make MNbC as an appreciable candidate for further bio-applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aacridine orange 3aapoptosis 3acell lines 3acell membranes 3achitosan 3acytotoxicity 3adifferential scanning calorimetry 3aethidium 3afibroblasts 3afluorescence 3amagnetism 3ananocomposites 3aneoplasm cells 3aneoplasms 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3astaining 3athermogravimetry 3atoxicity testing 0aMagnetic nanobiocomposite 0aClick chemistry 0aCytotoxic assay 0aThermal stability1 aTashakkorian, Hamed1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2748-74401 aGolpour, Monire0 tCarbohydrate polymers.g2019 Aug. 02, dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl47819x0144-86177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbpol.2019.1151633Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03225naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245012300168300001600291520167900307592002801986650001302014650002102027650002002048650001602068650001602084650002002100650003102120650002102151650002002172650002802192650001602220650001802236650000902254650001702263650002202280650001402302700001402316700001902330700001802349700001402367700001902381700001602400700001702416700001802433700001902451773010902470856008402579990002302663852000902686655001202695IND60097757720221122220320.0141104e20110110xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009775772DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ejphar.2010.07.0382doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTang, Fu-Tian10aTanshinone IIA attenuates atherosclerosis in ApoE⁻/⁻ mice through down-regulation of scavenger receptor expression  ap. 275-284.  aThis study is designed to investigate the protection of tanshinone IIA (TSIIA) against atherosclerosis in apolipoprotein E deficient (ApoE⁻/⁻) mice and to explore the mechanisms by focusing on the expressions of scavenger receptors, scavenger receptor-A (SR-A) and CD36. The in vivo study demonstrated that TSIIA (10–90mg/kg) inhibited the atherosclerotic lesions, down-regulated the CD68 protein expression in lesion and decreased the contents of cholesterol in aortas of ApoE⁻/⁻ mice. In addition, TSIIA reduced the serum levels of oxidized LDL (oxLDL) and down-regulated the mRNA expression of CD36, SR-A and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) in aortas. The in vitro study showed that TSIIA (0.1–10μM) decreased cholesterol level and DiI-oxLDL uptake in mouse peritoneal macrophages treated with oxLDL (50μg/ml). In addition, TSIIA down-regulated the mRNA and protein expression of CD36 but not that of SR-A in oxLDL treated macrophages. TSIIA also down-regulated the mRNA expression of PPARγ in oxLDL treated macrophages. Furthermore, TSIIA reduced the mRNA expression of CD36 in macrophages treated with PPARγ agonist 15d-PGJ₂ (2μM) or troglitazone (50μM), whereas both 15d-PGJ₂ (0.5–1.5μM) and troglitazone (5–20μM) dose-dependently abolished the down-regulation of CD36 expression by TSIIA in oxLDL treated macrophages. These results suggest that TSIIA attenuates the atherosclerotic lesion in ApoE⁻/⁻ mice, which might be attributed to the properties of both anti-oxidation and down-regulation of scavenger receptors. Furthermore, antagonism of PPARγ might be involved in the down-regulation of CD36 by TSIIA.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagonists 3aapolipoprotein E 3aatherosclerosis 3ablood serum 3acholesterol 3agene expression 3agene expression regulation 3ain vitro studies 3ain vivo studies 3alow density lipoprotein 3amacrophages 3amessenger RNA 3amice 3apharmacology 3aprotein synthesis 3areceptors1 aCao, Yuan1 aWang, Tie-Qiao1 aWang, Li-Jing1 aGuo, Jiao1 aZhou, Xiao-Shi1 aXu, Suo-wen1 aLiu, Weihua,1 aLiu, Pei-Qing1 aHuang, He-Qing0 tEuropean journal of pharmacology.g2011 Jan. 10, v. 650, no. 1 p.275-284dElsevier B.V.x0014-29997nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ejphar.2010.07.0383Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03039naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004900094040001800143100001800161245006900179300001800248500000900266520188300275592002802158650002202186650001402208650001202222650002302234650001302257650001902270650001302289650000902302650002402311650001102335650001602346651001702362700001902379773015002398856009602548852000902644655001202653IND60668260620221120084120.0191125e199207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066826062DNAL7 a10.2136/sssaj1992.03615995005600040021x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEllert, B. H.10aTemperature Dependence of Net Nitrogen and Sulfur Mineralization  ap. 1133-1141.  aepub  aModels to express the responses of N and S mineralization to temperature are essential to predict the amounts of plant-available N and S released from soil organic matter. We improved the methods conventionally used to describe temperature dependence by fitting, simultaneously, kinetic models and temperature-response functions. Net N or S mineralization was defined as a function of temperature, time, and length of incubation interval. These single-step models facilitated objective comparisons of rival temperature functions. The various functions represented rival hypotheses about the temperature dependence of mineralization. Temperature responses traditionally have been described by Arrhenius or Q₁₀ (temperature coefficient) functions, but a quadratic function was required to describe declining responses at warm temperatures. We compared the Arrhenius and Q₁₀ functions, and showed how indices of temperature response (activation energy and Q₁₀) are derived from the finite differentials of the response functions. Single values of Q₁₀ described rates that climbed exponentially with temperature, but separate values of Q₁₀ for each temperature interval (5–15, 15–25, and 25–30 °C) were required when the responses diminished in warm soils (quadratic response). Temperature was a major factor influencing N and S mineralization in a sequence of soils under the following management regimes: native forest, recently cleared forest, and long-term cultivation. Various combinations of kinetic equations and temperature functions were required to describe the time and temperature dependence of mineralization in soils under contrasting management. The models were proposed as multiple working hypotheses about the processes involved in mineralization. Contribution no. R 679 from the Saskatchewan Institute of Pedology.

Here we sought to develop a new complete, low‐cost and rapid (approximately 2·5 h) detection system requiring minimal operator input. METHODS AND RESULTS: We observed a strong correlation between culture‐based cell counts and our ability to detect either Campylobacter jejuni or Campylobacter coli by loop‐mediated isothermal amplification from the same samples. This knowledge was used to develop a rapid and simple five‐step assay to quantify Campylobacter, which was subsequently assessed for its specificity, reproducibility and accuracy in quantifying Campylobacter levels from processed chickens. The assay was found to be highly specific for C. jejuni and C. coli and was capable of distinguishing between samples that are either within or exceeding the industry set target of 6000 Campylobacter colony forming units (CFU) per carcass (equivalent to 12 CFU per ml of chicken rinse) with >90% accuracy relative to culture‐based methods. CONCLUSIONS: Our method can reliably quantify Campylobacter counts of processed chickens with an accuracy comparable to culture‐based assays but provides results within hours as opposed to days. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The research presented here will help improve food safety by providing fast Campylobacter detection that will enable the implementation of real‐time risk management strategies in poultry processing plants to rapidly test processed chickens and identify effective intervention strategies. This technology is a powerful tool that can be easily adapted for other organisms and thus could be highly beneficial for a broad range of industries.  aPublisher supplied data  aPRJ‐009841cAgrifutures Australia  cQueensland Department of Agriculture and Fisheries0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aCampylobacter coli 3aCampylobacter jejuni 3achickens 3afood safety 3aloop-mediated isothermal amplification 3ameat processing plants 3arisk management1 aBlackall, P.J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4107-94511 aBotella, J.R.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4446-34321 aTempleton, J.M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0307-26380 tJournal of applied microbiology.g2020 Mar., v. 128, no. 3 p.620-629dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl54923x1364-50727nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jam.145093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03894naa a2200769 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002300150245009700173300001600270520182700286592002802113650002202141650001602163650002502179650002202204650001202226650001802238650002202256650002002278650001902298650001502317650001602332650001702348650003902365650001702404650001302421650001602434653000802450653000802458653000902466653000702475653000902482653000802491653001402499653000902513653000802522653000802530653000802538653000802546653000802554653000902562653000902571653001402580653002202594653001402616653001502630653001602645700002102661700001902682700001802701700002002719700002402739700002402763700002102787700002802808700002302836700002002859700002002879773011902899856008503018852000903103655001203112IND60631020520221119213808.0200424e201809  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063102052DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbabio.2018.04.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGiorgio, Valentina14aThe idebenone metabolite QS10 restores electron transfer in complex I and coenzyme Q defects  ap. 901-908.  aIdebenone is a hydrophilic short-chain coenzyme (Co) Q analogue, which has been used as a potential bypass of defective complex I in both Leber Hereditary Optic Neuropathy and OPA1-dependent Dominant Optic Atrophy. Based on its potential antioxidant effects, it has also been tested in degenerative disorders such as Friedreich's ataxia, Huntington's and Alzheimer's diseases. Idebenone is rapidly modified but the biological effects of its metabolites have been characterized only partially. Here we have studied the effects of quinones generated during in vivo metabolism of idebenone with specific emphasis on 6-(9-carboxynonyl)-2,3-dimethoxy-5-methyl-1,4-benzoquinone (QS10). QS10 partially restored respiration in cells deficient of complex I or of CoQ without inducing the mitochondrial permeability transition, a detrimental effect of idebenone that may offset its potential benefits [Giorgio et al. (2012) Biochim. Biophys. Acta 1817: 363–369]. Remarkably, respiration was largely rotenone-insensitive in complex I deficient cells and rotenone-sensitive in CoQ deficient cells. These findings indicate that, like idebenone, QS10 can provide a bypass to defective complex I; and that, unlike idebenone, QS10 can partially replace endogenous CoQ. In zebrafish (Danio rerio) treated with rotenone, QS10 was more effective than idebenone in allowing partial recovery of respiration (to 40% and 20% of the basal respiration of untreated embryos, respectively) and allowing zebrafish survival (80% surviving embryos at 60 h post-fertilization, a time point at which all rotenone-treated embryos otherwise died). We conclude that QS10 is potentially more active than idebenone in the treatment of diseases caused by complex I defects, and that it could also be used in CoQ deficiencies of genetic and acquired origin.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAlzheimer disease 3aDanio rerio 3aantioxidant activity 3aataxia (disorder) 3aatrophy 3abenzoquinones 3aelectron transfer 3aembryo (animal) 3ahydrophilicity 3ametabolism 3ametabolites 3amitochondria 3aperipheral nervous system diseases 3apermeability 3arotenone 3aubiquinones 0aCoQ 0aCRC 0aFCCP 0aCs 0aDMEM 0ahpf 0aidebenone 0aNQO1 0aOCR 0aPTP 0aQS4 0aQS6 0aQS8 0aQS10 0aTMRM 0aIdebenone 0aElectron transfer 0aComplex I 0aUbiquinone 0aRespiration1 aSchiavone, Marco1 aGalber, Chiara1 aCarini, Marco1 aDa Ros, Tatiana1 aPetronilli, Valeria1 aArgenton, Francesco1 aCarelli, Valerio1 aAcosta Lopez, Manuel J.1 aSalviati, Leonardo1 aPrato, Maurizio1 aBernardi, Paolo0 tBiochimica et biophysica acta.g2018 Sept., v. 1859, no. 9 p.901-908dElsevier B.V.wJournal:1927x0005-27287nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbabio.2018.04.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03025naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094024003500122040001800157100001800175245010800193300001800301520154600319592002801865650001101893650002101904650002801925650001101953650002901964650002601993650001202019650002602031650001402057650003702071650001202108650001502120651001102135653002602146653002102172653002302193653002402216653002302240700002502263700001802288700001702306773013002323856008102453852000902534655001202543IND60651535120221120134308.0190711e201811  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065153512DNAL7 a30101730 301017302pmid7 a10.1017/S13689800180019212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChaput, Sarah10aPromoting access to fresh fruits and vegetables through a local market intervention at a subway station  ap. 3258-3270.  aAlternative food sources (AFS) such as local markets in disadvantaged areas are promising strategies for preventing chronic disease and reducing health inequalities. The present study assessed how sociodemographic characteristics, physical access and fruit and vegetable (F&V) consumption are associated with market use in a newly opened F&V market next to a subway station in a disadvantaged neighbourhood. Two cross-sectional surveys were conducted among adults: (i) on-site, among shoppers who had just bought F&V and (ii) a telephone-based population survey among residents living within 1 km distance from the market. One neighbourhood in Montreal (Canada) with previously limited F&V offerings. Respectively, 218 shoppers and 335 residents completed the on-site and telephone-based population surveys. Among shoppers, 23 % were low-income, 56 % did not consume enough F&V and 54 % did not have access to a car. Among all participants living 1 km from the market (n 472), market usage was associated (OR; 95 % CI) with adequate F&V consumption (1·86; 1·10, 3·16), living closer to the market (for distance: 0·86; 0·76, 0·97), having the market on the commute route (2·77; 1·61, 4·75) and not having access to a car (2·96; 1·67, 5·26). When implemented in strategic locations such as transport hubs, AFS like F&V markets offer a promising strategy to improve F&V access among populations that may be constrained in their food acquisition practices, including low-income populations and those relying on public transportation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadults 3achronic diseases 3across-sectional studies 3afruits 3alow-income neighborhoods 3alow-income population 3amarkets 3apublic transportation 3araw fruit 3asociodemographic characteristics 3asurveys 3avegetables 3aCanada 0aFruits and vegetables 0aFood environment 0aFarmers’ markets 0aHealth inequalities 0aLocal food systems1 aMercille, Geneviève1 aDrouin, Louis1 aKestens, Yan0 tPublic health nutrition.g2018 Nov., v. 21, no. 17 p.3258-3270dCambridge University PresswJournal:jnl56775x1475-27277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S13689800180019213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02611naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002000149245008600169506002800255520133600283592002801619506003701647650002001684650001701704650001101721650001801732650000901750650001601759650001101775650001101786650002001797650001101817650001201828650001401840650001701854700002001871700001901891700002101910700002301931700002301954773009601977856008302073852000902156655001202165IND60739989520221207120218.0190411s2019    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073998952DNAL7 a10.1051/bioconf/201913040042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTommaso, Frioni10aKaolin treatments on Pinot noir grapevines for the control of heat stress damages  aResource is Open Access  aThe aim of the study was to verify if vineyard kaolin application during the 2017 hot summer could reduce the negative effects of high temperatures and heat stress on canopy physiological processes, yield and fruit quality. The kaolin was applied once at the beginning of August, at 3% concentration, in a Pinot Noir vineyard. The application was performed only to the west side of the rows, where the vines were more subjected to heat stress. The 2017 summer was very hot, with maximum air temperature higher than 35 °C for several consecutive days in June, July and August and with heat waves that reached 42.3 °C in August. The kaolin coating works by significantly reducing leaf temperatures in comparison to untreated vines, with an average of about − 4 °C and up to −6 °C. Moreover, it maintains high the photosynthetic activity preventing irreversible photoinhibition phenomena, whereas untreated vines exhibit a marked physiological damage with chlorotic and necrotic leaves, dehydrated berries and sunburn damages. At harvest, 30-35% of the untreated vines were affected by severe water stress symptoms and produced unmarketable fruits. In comparison to the untreated vines, those sprayed with kaolin showed a higher yield (+27%), higher anthocyanins (+35%) and higher concentration of organic acids (+11%)  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aair temperature 3aanthocyanins 3acanopy 3afruit quality 3aheat 3aheat stress 3akaolin 3aleaves 3aphotoinhibition 3asummer 3asunburn 3avineyards 3awater stress1 aSergio, Tombesi1 aElisa, Luciani1 aPaolo, Sabbatini1 aBerrios, Julian G.1 aAlberto, Palliotti0 tBIO web of conferences.g2019, v. 13 p.04004-dEDP ScienceswJournal:27810x2117-44587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1051/bioconf/201913040043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02215naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245006400171500002200235520088900257592002801146650001401174650001401188650002801202650002001230650002401250650001301274650002201287650001401309650001401323653002601337653001701363653002601380653001901406700001801425700001601443700001701459700001301476700001401489700001901503700001801522700001801540773009201558856008601650852000901736655001201745IND60656227820221119192911.0190809e20190807xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065622782DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbpol.2019.1151842doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Congcong10aNanocellulose Sponges as Efficient Continuous Flow Reactors  aPre-press version  aIn this paper, we demonstrated an efficient continuous flow reactor packed with nanocellulose sponges made from the sustainable wood pulp. The key component of such reactor, a wood pulp derived nanocellulose sponge loaded with metal catalysts, exhibited high porosity and interconnected porous structure, providing low flow resistance and long-term stability to the flow reactors. The packing material showed good performance in Huisgen cycloaddition in both batch and continuous flow systems. Key comparisons between two systems including reaction kinetics, operating conditions and safety were particularly discussed. Various triazoles have been afforded with >99% conversion, even for gram scale reaction in flow systems. The continuous flow reactors we developed were easily derivatized, thus forming a general, economic and readily scalable platform as promising synthesis tools.  aPublisher supplied data 3acatalysts 3acellulose 3acycloaddition reactions 3aflow resistance 3apackaging materials 3aporosity 3areaction kinetics 3atriazoles 3awood pulp 0ananocellulose sponges 0aflow reactor 0aHuisgen cycloaddition 0aflow chemistry1 aFeng, Xueling1 aWang, Bijia1 aMao, Zhiping1 aXu, Hong1 aZhong, Yi1 aZhang, Linping1 aChen, Xiaoyun1 aSui, Xiaofeng0 tCarbohydrate polymers.g2019 Aug. 07, dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl47819x0144-86177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbpol.2019.1151843Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03296naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100001900184245004000203300002000243506007600263520181200339592002802151506003702179650001902216650001602235650001102251650002502262650001802287650002402305650001402329650001702343650002002360650002902380650002202409650002402431650001402455650002502469650001902494650003102513650002102544650001602565773014102581856008302722852000902805655001202814IND4470749820221207110933.0120419e201112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447074982DNAL7 a10.3945/ajcn.111.0126252doi7 aPMC32260202pmcid7 a220894432pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKosmiski, Lisa10aEnergy expenditure in HIV infection  ap. 1677S-1682S.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aEnergy intake recommendations for adults should be based preferably on direct measurements of total daily energy expenditure (TDEE) in corresponding populations who are maintaining healthy body weight and satisfactory physical activity levels. During adolescence, pregnancy, and lactation, energy requirements should be based on TDEE plus the additional energy required to advance these physiologic states. With illness, energy expenditure and energy intake change, but nutritional intervention is not necessarily beneficial. This article reviews data on energy expenditure in HIV infection with a focus on adults, adolescents aged ≥14 y, and pregnant and lactating women. Resting energy expenditure (REE) in adults with untreated asymptomatic HIV is ∼10% higher than in healthy control subjects. In asymptomatic adults receiving antiretroviral therapy, REE may be similarly increased. HIV wasting and secondary infections are also associated with increased REE. In contrast, TDEE is typically normal in asymptomatic HIV and decreased in HIV wasting and secondary infection. No direct measurements of REE or TDEE are available in adolescents or in pregnant or lactating women with HIV. On the basis of current data, energy intake may need to increase by ∼10% in adults with asymptomatic HIV to maintain body weight. In adolescents and in pregnant and lactating women with asymptomatic HIV, energy requirements should approximate recommendations for their uninfected counterparts until further data are available. In the resource-rich world, the energy expenditure changes associated with HIV are unlikely to contribute to significant weight loss. More data are needed on energy expenditure in HIV-infected populations from developing nations, where concurrent malnutrition and coinfections are common.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aHIV infections 3aadolescence 3aadults 3adeveloping countries 3aenergy intake 3aenergy requirements 3alactation 3amalnutrition 3amixed infection 3anutritional intervention 3aphysical activity 3aphysiological state 3apregnancy 3apregnant adolescents 3apregnant women 3aresting energy expenditure 3awasting syndrome 3aweight loss0 tAmerican journal of clinical nutrition.g2011 Dec., v. 94, no. 6 p.1677S-1682SdAmerican Society for Clinical Nutritionx0002-91657nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3945/ajcn.111.0126253Available from publisher's Web site  aDNAL 7aarticle03684naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100003200147245011600179520213600295592002802431650001402459650001802473650001202491650000902503650002602512650001702538650002502555651001202580651001102592651002002603651000902623653001702632653002202649653001702671653002602688653001402714653002302728700003202751700003702783700003502820700002902855700004502884700002702929700002602956773011702982856008203099852000903181655001203190IND60740503820221119160958.0220606e20210915xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074050382DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jep.2021.1141882doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMacêdo, Sandra Kelle Souza10aGenus Triplaris (Polygonaceae): A review on traditional medicinal use, phytochemistry and biological activities  aThe genus Triplaris (Polygonaceae) comprises approximately 25 species distributed throughout South and Central America. Some species have been used in folk medicine, mainly, to treat malaria, leishmaniasis, diarrheia, dysenteria, pain and inflammation. The purpose of this review is to provide information on the traditional uses, phytochemistry and known biological activities of Triplaris, an important genus for South America research groups on medicinal plants, in order to explore its therapeutic potential to direct future research in the search for new bioactive molecules. The available information on the genus Triplaris was gathered from scientific databases (LILACS, Pubmed, SciELO, Science Direct, Scopus, CAPES Periodicals Portal and Theses and Dissertations Catalog) before March 2020 using the keyword “Triplaris”. Works related to traditional uses, phytochemistry and biological activities of plants were included in this review. Most of the studies involving Triplaris were conducted by research groups located in Brazil, Peru e Bolivia. Probably, because the genus has been used in folk medicine only by these countries. Regarding the annual evolution of the publications, a larger number of articles published in 2010 were observed. Flavonols represent the main classe of secondary metabolites from Triplaris. In terms of the pharmacological investigations, T. americana and T. gardneriana are considered the most studied species, with extensive promising biological activities. The pharmacological activities can be attributed to bioactive phytochemicals. All findings indicate that Triplaris is an important genus of the Polygonaceae family. However, considering its chemical and pharmacological importance, the studies developed with Triplaris species are still limited, representing an opportunity to investigate new bioactive molecules and extracts. The review shows that little pre-clinical or in vivo research is available to prove the ethnopharmacological records in the genre. Therefore, this review encourages further studies on Triplaris in the search for a wide range of therapeutic products.  aPublisher supplied data 3aflavonols 3aleishmaniasis 3amalaria 3apain 3asecondary metabolites 3atherapeutics 3atraditional medicine 3aBolivia 3aBrazil 3aCentral America 3aPeru 0aPolygonaceae 0aEthnopharmacology 0aPharmacology 0aSecondary metabolites 0aFlavonols 0aPhenolic compounds1 aLima, Kátia Simoni Bezerra1 aSilva, Naiane Darklei dos Santos1 aCampos, Sírley Sharliny Gomes1 aAraújo, Bruna Rodrigues1 aAlmeida, Jackson Roberto Guedes da Silva1 aRolim, Larissa Araújo1 aNunes, Xirley Pereira0 tJournal of ethnopharmacology.g2021 Sept. 15, v. 277 p.114188-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl30651x0378-87417nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jep.2021.1141883Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02665naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004900094040001800143100001900161245004500180300001600225500000900241520135500250592002801605650002301633650001401656650002001670650001201690650001501702650002501717650000901742650001101751650001601762650001301778650001101791650002301802650001101825650001401836650001401850650000901864650001201873650001501885700002001900700002101920773014901941856009602090852000902186655001202195IND60668260720221120084157.0191125e197609  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066826072DNAL7 a10.2136/sssaj1976.03615995004000050045x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFrancis, C.

The major advantage of such a rotor over conventional swinging bucket rotors is that relatively large quantities may be segregated; 15 g in large-scale zonal rotors vs. 0.25 g per centrifugal tube with swinging bucket rotors. The rotor was used to isolate and identify soil-sediment reaction sites of ¹³⁷Cs, ⁶⁰Co, and ¹⁰⁶Ru. The ¹³⁷Cs was found to be associated with micaceous minerals, the ⁶⁰Co with Fe-sesquioxides, and the ¹⁰⁶Ru with organic rich soil components. An edge-unloading rotor containing sucrose gradients (max. density 1.3 g/cm³) was used in a rate-zonal mode to isolate Cd and Ni enriched fractions of sediment taken near the wastewater discharge of a Cd-Ni battery plant. In sediments enriched in carbonates, Cd was found to be largely associated with the carbonates while Ni was concentrated in the organic rich soil components. Biological availability of Cd was evaluated by growing bush bean seedlings (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) in nutrient solutions containing density fractions of a soil clay. Density gradient separations using large-scale rotors were shown to be a valuable adjunct to chemical extraction techniques for characterizing trace element interactions with soils and sediments.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPhaseolus vulgaris 3abatteries 3abioavailability 3acadmium 3acarbonates 3acesium radioisotopes 3aclay 3acobalt 3agreen beans 3aminerals 3anickel 3anutrient solutions 3arotors 3asediments 3aseedlings 3asoil 3asucrose 3awastewater1 aBrinkley, F.

It is also known that outcross siring success and the selfing rate in self-compatible hermaphrodites can be density dependent. Here, we use array experiments to show that the mating system (i.e., the outcrossing rate) and the siring success of morphs with divergent sex allocation strategies are both density dependent and frequency dependent in androdioecious populations of the wind-pollinated, annual plant Mercurialis annua. In particular, the outcrossing rate is a decreasing function of the mean interplant distance, regulated by a negative exponential pollen fall-off curve. Our results indicate that pollen dispersed from a male inflorescence are over 60%% more likely to sire outcrossed progeny than equivalent pollen dispersed from hermaphrodites, likely due to the fact that males, but not hermaphrodites, disperse their pollen from erect inflorescence stalks. Because of this difference, and because males of M. annua produce much more pollen than hermaphrodites, the presence of males in the experimental arrays reduced both the selfing rate and the outcross siring success of hermaphrodites. We use our results to infer a density threshold below which males are unable to persist with hermaphrodites but above which they can invade hermaphroditic populations. We discuss our findings in the context of a metapopulation model, in which males can only persist in well-established populations but are excluded from small, sparse populations, for example, in the early stages of colonization.  aPublisher supplied data 0aAndrodioecy 0acolonization 0adioecy 0aMercurialis annua 0aself-fertilization 0asex ratio 0awind pollination1 aPannell, John R.0 tEvolution.g2007 Oct., v. 61, no. 10 p.2349-2359dBlackwell Science Incx1558-56467nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111%2Fj.1558-5646.2007.00195.x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02532naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002200152245013500174300001600309520150500325592002801830650001501858650001201873650001001885650001001895650001801905650001101923650002701934650002201961650001401983650001401997700001802011773008902029856005502118852000902173655001202182IND4435846720221119203826.0121011e201005  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443584672DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1600-0706.2009.18163.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMooney, Kailen A.10aCompetition hierarchies among ants and predation by birds jointly determine the strength of multi‐species ant–aphid mutualisms  ap. 874-882.  aProtection mutualisms often involve multiple species of protector that vary in quality as mutualists. Because protectors may compete for access to mutualists, concordance between competitive ability and degree of benefit will determine the overall strength of multi‐species mutualisms. We compared the abilities of two similarly sized congener ants as competitors for, and mutualists of pine‐feeding aphids, and how insectivorous birds affected each ant–aphid mutualism. Formica planipilis and F. podzolica were indistinguishable in forager abundance, but the former was 13‐fold more abundant at competition baits and provided 11‐fold more benefits to aphids. These results highlight how, in a single environment, a great ecological distance can exist between two congener ants of similar size. Insectivorous birds disrupted the two mutualisms to a similar extent, reducing aphid and ant abundance by 91% and 39% respectively. Nevertheless, birds had an important influence on the relative benefits of the two ants to aphids: where F. planipilis consistently benefited aphids, F. podzolica only did so in the absence of birds. Consequently, the presence of insectivorous birds and ant species identity jointly determined whether ant–aphid mutualisms occurred in pine canopies and the strength of such interactions. Our study highlights the inter‐relatedness of competition, predation and mutualism, and how competition can serve to strengthen mutualism by filtering inferior mutualists.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAphidoidea 3aFormica 3aPinus 3abaits 3abirds of prey 3acanopy 3aecological competition 3aleaf-cutting ants 3amutualism 3apredation1 aMandal, Kunal0 tOikos.g2010 May, v. 119, no. 5 p.874-882dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0030-12997nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1600-0706.2009.18163.x  aDNAL 7aarticle02821naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100005500150245018300205300001400388520153700402592002801939650001601967650001101983650002701994650002102021650001502042650001102057650001802068650001402086650001502100650001702115650002402132650001702156700001702173700001202190700001302202700001702215773008502232856008502317852000902402655001202411IND60614310020221123012458.0210114e201901  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061431002DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbon.2018.09.0552doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Dewei1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0357-324812aA robust strategy for the general synthesis of hierarchical carbons constructed by nanosheets and their application in high performance supercapacitor in ionic liquid electrolyte  ap. 40-49.  aPorous nanocarbons are considered to be one of the key materials for electrochemical energy storage and conversion systems. In the present work, a straightforward one-step technique based on versatile magnesiothermic reduction combined with conventional KOH activation has been developed. We found that the magnesium (Mg) fulfilled multiple roles in the whole reaction and indispensable for achieving control over the organization of 2D nanobuilding blocks. Encouragingly, the same procedures can be successfully applied to a variety of carbon-rich chemicals as carbon sources to produce porous nanocarbons constructed by nanosheets. The intriguing structural features hold a great promise for electrochemical energy storage applications. As a typical example, the resultant HPCMC-1(synthesis from carboxymethylcellulose sodium) possesses unique interconnected carbon sheets network structures with a very large specific surface area and optimal bimodal microporous size distributions. The distinct structural features endow HPCMC-1 electrodes with excellent capacitive storage performance in ionic liquid electrolyte, which show large specific capacitance, good rate capability, long cycling performance and excellent synergetic energy-power outputting capabilities. Considering the general synthetic strategy together with the material sustainability, our work may open up another way for design and controllable fabrication nanocarbon architectures for applications in electrochemical energy storage fields with high performance.  aPublisher supplied data 3acapacitance 3acarbon 3acarboxymethylcellulose 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrodes 3aenergy 3aionic liquids 3amagnesium 3ananosheets 3aporous media 3apotassium hydroxide 3asurface area1 aNai, Jiawang1 aLi, Hua1 aXu, Lang1 aWang, Yatong0 tCarbon.g2019 Jan., v. 141 p.40-49dElsevier LtdwJournal:11670x0008-62237nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbon.2018.09.0553Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03124naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002000164245011800184300001800302520124200320592002801562650002101590650001501611650001301626650001801639650001701657650003001674650001601704650002001720650002001740650002901760650001601789650002601805650001601831650002601847650003701873650004001910650003101950650001701981650001901998650002002017650002002037650005402057650003002111650004802141650002502189650001602214700001702230700001402247700001702261700002102278773014402299852000902443856008202452655001202534IND4399884320221119011357.0200312e200801  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439988432DNAL7 a179942342pmid7 a10.1007/s00253-007-1253-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPinheiro, L.

A modified version of the gfp gene has been generated by mutagenesis and expressed under the control of the bacteriophage lambda promoter PL. A cassette comprising bacteriophage Mu transposon arms flanking the modified gfp gene and regulatory regions was irreversibly integrated as an in-vitro-assembled transposition complex into the genomes of Escherichia coli and Salmonella spp. The modified green fluorescent protein (GFP) protein retained the fluorescence excitation and emission wavelengths of wild-type GFP. However, it fluoresced more brightly in E. coli and Salmonella compared to wild-type GFP, presumably due to improved protein maturation. Fluorescent E. coli and Salmonella strains carrying the gfp gene cassette were easily differentiated from their respective non-fluorescent parental strains on various growth media by visualization under UV light. The bacterial strains produced by this method remained viable and stably fluorescent when incorporated into a matrix for delivery of exact numbers of viable bacterial cells for use as quality control agents in microbiological procedures.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3aSalmonella 3abacteria 3aculture media 3afluorescence 3agreen fluorescent protein 3amutagenesis 3aquality control 3aregulator genes 3atransposition (genetics) 3atransposons 3aultraviolet radiation 3awavelengths 2aAmino Acidsxgenetics 2aChromosomes, Bacterialxgenetics 2aDNA Transposable Elementsxgenetics 2aEscherichia colixgenetics 2aFluorescence 2aGene Targeting 2aGenes, Reporter 2aGenetic Vectors 2aGreen Fluorescent Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aMutagenesis, Insertional. 2aRecombinant Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aSalmonellaxgenetics 2aTemperature1 aGibbs, M.

We present a field-based study at the Voulund agricultural test site, Denmark, that is, to the best of our knowledge, the first to focus on the vertical self-potential distribution prior to and during a saline tracer test. A coupled hydrogeophysical modeling framework is used to simulate the SP response to precipitation and saline tracer infiltration. A layered hydrological model is first obtained by inverting dielectric and matric potential data. The resulting model that compares favorably with electrical resistance tomography models is subsequently used to predict the SP response. The electrokinetic contribution (caused by water fluxes in a charged porous soil) is modeled by an effective excess charge approach that considers both water saturation and pore water salinity. Our results suggest that the effective excess charge evolution prior to the tracer injection is better described by a recent flux-averaged model based on soil water retention functions than by a previously proposed volume-averaging model. This is the first time that raw (i.e., without post-processing or data-correction) vertically distributed SP measurements have been explained by a physically based model. The electrokinetic contribution cannot alone reproduce the experimental SP data during the tracer test and an electro-diffusive contribution (caused by concentration gradients) is needed. The predicted amplitude of this contribution is too small to perfectly explain the data, but the shape is in accordance with the field data. This discrepancy is attributed to imperfect descriptions of electro-diffusive phenomena in partially saturated soils, unaccounted soil heterogeneity, and discrepancies between the measured and predicted electrical conductivities in the tracer infiltration area. This study opens the way for detailed long-term field-based investigations of the SP method in vadose zone hydrology.  aPublisher supplied data 3aelectrical resistance 3agroundwater recharge 3ahydrologic models 3amonitoring 3aporous media 3arain 3asoil heterogeneity 3asoil water 3asoil water retention 3atomography 3atracer techniques 3avadose zone 3awater salinity 3aDenmark 0aHydrogeophysics 0aSelf-potential 0aElectrical resistivity 0aVadose zone 0aWater flux 0aTracer test1 aLinde, N.1 aHaarder, E.B.1 aLooms, M.C.0 tJournal of hydrology.g2015 Feb., v. 521 p.314-327dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl46539x0022-16947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2014.11.0413Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02152naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100002100154245007900175300001800254520112700272592002801399653001301427653001801440653001401458653002101472653001901493653001501512653002301527653002901550700002201579700002101601773009301622856009001715852000901805655001201814IND60127201420221120225206.0151110e200710  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012720142DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1558-5646.2007.00200.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHarper, Fiona M.10aIntrogression versus immigration in hybridizing high-dispersal echinoderms  ap. 2410-2418.  aPhylogeographic studies designed to estimate rates and patterns of genetic differentiation within species often reveal unexpected and graphically striking cases of allele or haplotype sharing between species (introgression) via hybridization and backcrossing. Does introgression between species significantly influence population genetic structure relative to more conventional sources of differentiation (drift) and similarity (dispersal) among populations within species?? Here we use mtDNA sequences from four species in two genera of sea urchins and sea stars to quantify the relative magnitude of gene flow across oceans and across species boundaries in the context of the trans-Arctic interchange of marine organisms between the Pacific and Atlantic oceans. In spite of the much smaller distances between sympatric congeners, rates of gene flow between sympatric species via heterospecific gamete interactions were small and significantly lower than gene flow across oceans via dispersal of planktonic larvae. We conclude that, in these cases at least, larvae are more effective than gametes as vectors of gene flow.  aPublisher supplied data 0aAsterias 0afertilization 0agene flow 0alarval dispersal 0aphylogeography 0aspeciation 0aStrongylocentrotus 0atrans-Arctic interchange1 aAddison, Jason A.1 aHart, Michael W.0 tEvolution.g2007 Oct., v. 61, no. 10 p.2410-2418dBlackwell Science Incx1558-56467nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111%2Fj.1558-5646.2007.00200.x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02216naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004900094040001800143100001500161245006300176300001600239500000900255520107200264592002801336650000801364650002001372650002001392650001901412650001701431650001101448650000901459650001901468650002001487650002401507650000901531650001801540700002001558773014701578856009601725852000901821655001201830IND60668674120221120083509.0191125e196205  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066867412DNAL7 a10.2136/sssaj1962.03615995002600030027x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSor, Kamil10aEffects of Rainfall Energy on the Permeability of Soils1,3  ap. 293-297.  aepub  aThe effects of simulated rainfall on the air and water permeabilities of sand and several disturbed soil samples were investigated.

Permeability of the soil to water was measured during and after the application of rainfall. It was found that a rainfall of 30 minutes duration at an intensity of 2.8 inches per hour caused maximum change in water permeability of the soils. Water permeability of quartz sand was not changed by rainfall. Water permeability of soils was changed; (a) only in top 1.5 cm. by 1.6 inches per hour rainfall, (b) greatly in top 1.5 cm. and somewhat less in second 1.5 cm. layer by 2.8 and 4.0 inches per hour rainfall. In saturated soil columns, water permeability was not governed entirely by the permeability of the least permeable layer. The thickness of the dispersed and compacted soil layer appeared to be about 1 mm. Below it a less compacted layer, about 3 cm. deep, resulted.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3acompacted soils 3adisturbed soils 3ainfiltrometers 3apermeability 3aquartz 3arain 3arain intensity 3arainfall energy 3arainfall simulation 3asand 3asoil sampling1 aBertrand, A.

Chinese consumers often face confusing information about a particular food product's safety and are concerned about the situation. Drawing upon stress coping theory, this study examines whether consumer confusion and negative emotions drive intentions to adopt ethical food. Data collected from a sample of 505 consumers were analyzed using structural equation modeling. The results show that consumer confusion has a significant impact on negative emotions, which in turn influence intentions to purchase ethical food products. This research advances the food preference literature by providing a new perspective on ethical consumption based on coping strategies. The findings are important for policymakers and business leaders seeking to develop and better promote safer and more ethical food programs in China.  aPublisher supplied data 3acoping strategies 3adata collection 3aemotions 3aethics 3afood and nutrition programs 3afood choices 3afood safety 3afoods 3astructural equation modeling 3aChina 0aConsumer confusion 0aNegative emotion 0aStress coping 0aEthical consumption1 aLin, Zhibin1 aMcLeay, Fraser0 tFood quality and preference.g2020 Oct., v. 85 p.103981-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46499x0950-32937nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodqual.2020.1039813Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02927naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100005500139245007400194300001600268500001100284520150600295592002801801650001901829650001801848650001601866650001201882650001001894650001501904650002601919650001001945650001301955650002101968650002501989650001302014650001602027650002902043650001402072650001502086700001902101700002002120700001702140700001902157700005502176773013202231856007302363852000902436655001202445IND60683839020221122003510.0200213e202003  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068383902DNAL7 a10.1111/jam.143862doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSayed, A.M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1442-183X10aExtreme environments: microbiology leading to specialized metabolites  ap. 630-657.  aREVIEW  aThe prevalence of multidrug‐resistant microbial pathogens due to the continued misuse and overuse of antibiotics in agriculture and medicine is raising the prospect of a return to the preantibiotic days of medicine at the time of diminishing numbers of drug leads. The good news is that an increased understanding of the nature and extent of microbial diversity in natural habitats coupled with the application of new technologies in microbiology and chemistry is opening up new strategies in the search for new specialized products with therapeutic properties. This review explores the premise that harsh environmental conditions in extreme biomes, notably in deserts, permafrost soils and deep‐sea sediments select for micro‐organisms, especially actinobacteria, cyanobacteria and fungi, with the potential to synthesize new druggable molecules. There is evidence over the past decade that micro‐organisms adapted to life in extreme habitats are a rich source of new specialized metabolites. Extreme habitats by their very nature tend to be fragile hence there is a need to conserve those known to be hot‐spots of novel gifted micro‐organisms needed to drive drug discovery campaigns and innovative biotechnology. This review also provides an overview of microbial‐derived molecules and their biological activities focusing on the period from 2010 until 2018, over this time 186 novel structures were isolated from 129 representatives of microbial taxa recovered from extreme habitats.  aPublisher supplied data 3aActinobacteria 3aCyanobacteria 3aantibiotics 3adeserts 3adrugs 3aecosystems 3aenvironmental factors 3afungi 3ahabitats 3amarine sediments 3amedicinal properties 3amedicine 3ametabolites 3amultiple drug resistance 3apathogens 3apermafrost1 aHassan, M.H.A.1 aAlhadrami, H.A.1 aHassan, H.M.1 aGoodfellow, M.1 aRateb, M.E.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4043-26870 tJournal of applied microbiology.g2020 Mar., v. 128, no. 3 p.630-657dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl54923x1364-50727nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jam.143863Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01965naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001500139245013400154300001800288520088800306592002801194650001201222650001701234650002301251650001701274650001901291650001301310650000901323700001801332700001301350700001301363700001901376700001901395773010501414856007501519852000901594655001201603IND60577758420221121091121.0170810e20121009xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057775842DNAL7 a10.1021/ma301553y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHou, Jiali10aIn Situ Generated 1:1 Zn(II)-Containing Polymer Complex Sensor for Highly Enantioselective Recognition of N-Boc-Protected Alanine  ap. 7835-7842.  aA novel chiral (S)-BINAM-based fluorescence polymer sensor was designed and synthesized by the polymerization of 5,5′-((2,5-dioctyloxy-1,4-phenylene)bis(ethyne-2,1-diyl)bis(2-hydroxy-3-(piperidin-1-ylmethyl)benzaldehyde (M-1) with (S)-2,2′-binaphthyldiamine (S-BINAM, M-2) via Schiff’s base formation. The resulting chiral polymer sensor shows very weak fluorescence but exhibits the obvious fluorescence enhancement response toward Zn²⁺. The in situ generated 1:1 Zn(II)-containing complex of chiral polymer can serve as a fluorescence sensor for highly enantioselective recognition of N-Boc-protected alanine, and the value of enantiomeric fluorescence difference ratio (ef) can reach as high as 6.90. This is the first report on the in situ generated chiral polymer complex used as a fluorescence sensor for highly enantioselective recognition of N-Boc-protected alanine.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalanine 3abenzaldehyde 3aenantioselectivity 3afluorescence 3apolymerization 3apolymers 3azinc1 aSong, Fengyan1 aWang, Lu1 aWei, Guo1 aCheng, Yixiang1 aZhu, Chengjian0 tMacromolecules.g2012 Oct. 09, v. 45, no. 19 p.7835-7842dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-58357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fma301553y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04080naa a2200913 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001500151245011800166520174200284592002802026650001502054650001602069650001202085650002002097650003102117650001002148650001202158650002202170650001802192650002102210650001202231650002302243650001002266650001802276650000902294650000902303650001302312650001702325650002202342650001202364650002302376650005302399650002502452650002202477650002202499650001502521650002502536653000902561653001102570653001002581653001002591653001102601653001002612653001102622653001102633653000802644653001002652653000902662653000902671653001002680653000902690653000702699653000702706653000702713653001202720653001102732653001102743653001002754653000702764653000902771653000902780653001102789653000902800653002102809653003002830653002402860653000902884700001202893700001802905700001702923773011902940856008603059852000903145655001203154IND60695451920221121014151.0200601e202007  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069545192DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jnutbio.2020.1083722doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Tiange10aMilk fat globule membrane and its component phosphatidylcholine induce adipose browning both in vivo and in vitro  aThe functional induction of brown-like adipocytes in white adipose tissue (WAT) provides a defense against obesity. The aim of this study was to analyze the effects of milk fat globule membrane (MFGM) and its component phosphatidylcholine (PC) on the brown remodeling of WAT. Male C57BL/6 J mice were fed a high-fat diet (HFD) for 8 weeks and then fed HFD for another 8 weeks with MFGM. In vitro studies were performed in C3H10T1/2 pluripotent stem cells, 3T3-L1 pre-adipocytes and differentiated inguinal WAT stromal vascular cells (SVCs) to determine the role of MFGM and PC on the formation of brown-like adipocytes. MFGM decreased fasting glucose and serum insulin levels in HFD-fed mice. MFGM improved glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity, and induced browning of inguinal WAT. MFGM and its component PC stimulated transformation of brown-like adipocytes in C3H10T1/2 pluripotent stem cells, 3T3-L1 adipocytes and SVCs by increasing the protein expression of UCP1, PGC-1α, PRDM16 as well as the mRNA expression of other thermogenic genes and beige cell markers. MFGM and PC also increased mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) copy number, mitochondrial density and oxygen consumption rate and up-regulated the mRNA expression of mitochondria-biogenesis-related genes in vitro. PPARα inhibitor GW6471 treatment or knockdown of PPARα using lentivirus-expressing shRNA inhibited the PC-induced increase in the protein expression of UCP1, PGC-1α and PRDM16 in C3H10T1/2 pluripotent stem cells and 3T3-L1 adipocytes, indicating the potential role of PPARα in PC-mediated brown-like adipocyte formation. In conclusion, MFGM and milk PC induced adipose browning, which has major protective effects against obesity and metabolic dysfunction.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadipocytes 3ablood serum 3afasting 3agene expression 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3aglucose 3aglucose tolerance 3ahigh fat diet 3ain vitro studies 3ainsulin 3ainsulin resistance 3amales 3amessenger RNA 3amice 3amilk 3amilk fat 3amitochondria 3amitochondrial DNA 3aobesity 3aoxygen consumption 3aperoxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha 3aphosphatidylcholines 3aprotective effect 3aprotein synthesis 3astem cells 3awhite adipose tissue 0aAMPK 0aβ3-AR 0aCD137 0aCidea 0aCited1 0aCox7a 0aCyto C 0aElovl3 0aHFD 0aIPITT 0aiWAT 0aMFGM 0amtDNA 0aOGTT 0aPC 0aPE 0aND 0aPGC-1α 0aPPARα 0aPRDM16 0aSirt1 0aSM 0aTbx1 0aTfam 0aTMEM26 0aUCP1 0aAdipose browning 0aMilk fat globule membrane 0aPhosphatidylcholine 0aUCP11 aDu, Min1 aWang, Hanning1 aMao, Xueying0 tJournal of nutritional biochemistry.g2020 July, v. 81 p.108372-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl44770x0955-28637nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jnutbio.2020.1083723Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03350naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094024003500122040001800157100002000175245009700195300001800292520175500310592002802065650002002093650002802113650002302141650002302164650002102187650001502208650001702223650001102240650002302251650001202274650002402286650001702310650001602327650001002343651001502353653001402368653000802382653002102390700002202411700001702433700001602450700001702466700002302483700002102506700002002527700002202547700000702569773013002576856008102706852000902787655001202796IND60651535620221120134348.0190711e201811  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065153562DNAL7 a30107861 301078612pmid7 a10.1017/S13689800180019702doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKhanam, Rasheda10aLevels and correlates of nutritional status of women of childbearing age in rural Bangladesh  ap. 3037-3047.  aThe present study examined the prevalence of and risk factors for malnutrition in a population-based cohort of women of childbearing age in rural Bangladesh. A cross-sectional study that collected pre-pregnancy weight, height, and data on selected risk factors for nutritional status of women. The study was conducted in Sylhet District of Bangladesh. Study subjects included 13 230 non-pregnant women of childbearing age. Women were classified into underweight (<18·5 kg/m²), normal (18·5–24·9 kg/m²) and overweight/obese (≥25·0 kg/m²) using BMI; and into moderate to severe stunting (<150 cm), mild stunting (150–<155 cm) and normal (≥155 cm) using height. Two multinomial logistic regression models were fitted for BMI: model 1 examined individual and household factors associated with BMI, and model 2 additionally examined the association of community variables. The same analysis was conducted for height. Prevalence of underweight, overweight/obesity and moderate to severe stunting was 37·0, 7·2 and 48·6 %, respectively. Women’s education and household wealth were inversely related to both underweight status and stunting. Underweight rate was significantly lower in the post-harvest season. Women with any education and who belonged to households with higher wealth were more likely to be overweight/obese. The study documented high underweight and stunting, and moderate overweight/obesity rates among rural Bangladeshi women; and recommends design and implementation of a multidimensional intervention programme based on individual-, household- and community-level risk factors that can address underweight, stunting and overweight/obesity to improve the nutritional status of women of childbearing age in Bangladesh.  aPublisher supplied data 3abody mass index 3across-sectional studies 3aeducational status 3agrowth retardation 3ahousehold income 3ahouseholds 3amalnutrition 3amodels 3anutritional status 3aobesity 3aregression analysis 3arisk factors 3aunderweight 3awomen 3aBangladesh 0aNutrition 0aBMI 0aOverweight/obese1 aLee, Anne Shee CC1 aRam, Malathi1 aQuaiyum, MA1 aNazma Begum,1 aChoudhury, Allysha1 aChristian, Parul1 aMullany, Luke C1 aBaqui, Abdullah H1 a, 0 tPublic health nutrition.g2018 Nov., v. 21, no. 16 p.3037-3047dCambridge University PresswJournal:jnl56775x1475-27277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S13689800180019703Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03687naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001900148245011900167500001900286520185700305592002802162650002902190650002402219650002002243650003102263650002502294650001702319650001602336650001202352650001702364650002402381650001602405650001202421650001202433650001102445650001602456650000702472650002302479650001902502650001502521650002302536650002302559651001002582653001002592653002302602653001902625653001402644653001602658700002002674700001802694700002402712700002602736700001802762700001602780700001802796700002102814773012202835856008302957852000903040655001203049IND60725428120221118001819.0210219e202101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072542812DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bcab.2021.1019212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aManzoor, Mehak10aFunctional Pediococcus acidilactici BC1 for the revitalization of ethnic black carrot kanji of indian subcontinent  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe present study aimed to screen the autochthonous lactic acid bacteria (LAB) to produce the black carrot (BC) Kanji, a Lacto-fermented beverage consumed in the Indian sub-continent. But the production of Kanji has never been commercialized using mono or mixed strain. Autochthonous P. acidilactici BC1 has been isolated from the spontaneously fermented Kanji. Subsequently, pasteurized BC juice was inoculated with 10 % (v/v) pre-culture with 2% (w/v) added sugars viz. brown sugar, glucose, and jaggery respectively. The effect of salt concentration (1–10 % w/v) and varying pH range (1.0–8.0) has been evaluated on the growth of P. acidilactici BC1. During fermentation, pH, titratable acidity (TA), LAB count, and total suspended solids (TSS) were observed and recorded at regular intervals. The pH of the BC juice decreased from an initial value of 5.12 to 3.27, 8.0–11.5 g/L lactic acid was accumulated after completion of the fermentation on the 9ᵗʰ day. The LAB count has reached a maximum count of 8.92 log CFU/mL during the fermentation. Total phenolics and antioxidant activity has been increased during and after fermentation i.e. 37.19 % and 45.70 % respectively. Probiotic traits of the P. acidilactici BC1 is an added benefit to the consumer and can be consumed as a product to be probiotic in nature. It was established that the fermentation of BC juice with added brown sugar and jaggery comes out as most accepted in all the variants due to the enrichment in phenolics, antioxidants, and probiotic properties. The protective nature of the fermented BC juice to control Salmonella enterica and Shigella boydii is a striking functionality of the fermented beverage. Controlled fermentation with plant phytochemicals and probiotic attributes can be explored as a potential food matrix loaded with antioxidants and postbiotics.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPediococcus acidilactici 3aSalmonella enterica 3aShigella boydii 3aagricultural biotechnology 3aantioxidant activity 3abiocatalysis 3abrown sugar 3acarrots 3afermentation 3afermented beverages 3afood matrix 3aglucose 3ajaggery 3ajuices 3alactic acid 3apH 3aphenolic compounds 3aphytochemicals 3aprobiotics 3asalt concentration 3atitratable acidity 3aIndia 0aKanji 0aPlant fermentation 0aAntipathogenic 0aPhenolics 0aPostbiotics1 aSharma, Vikrant1 aSingh, Deepti1 aSohal, Jagdip Singh1 aAseri, Gajender Kumar1 aKhare, Neeraj1 aVij, Shilpa1 aSaroop, Jyoti1 aSharma, Deepansh0 tBiocatalysis and agricultural biotechnology.g2021 Jan., v. 31 p.101921-dElsevier LtdwJournal:6239x1878-81817nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bcab.2021.1019213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02398naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003600092040001800128100001700146245006800163300001400231520135900245592002801604650001201632650002301644650001201667650001501679650002401694650001301718650001901731650001101750650002001761650001901781650001201800650001001812650001601822773009501838856008201933852000902015655001202024IND4476916420221117182101.0141112e201207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447691642DNAL7 a10.1016/j.sajb.2012.05.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSnyman, H.A.10aHabitat preferences of the encroacher shrub, Seriphium plumosum  ap. 34-39.  aThe ecology of Seriphium plumosum is not yet fully understood and therefore requires in-depth research to assist with the control of this encroacher plant. The habitat preferences of the plant were quantified for terrain morphological units in terms of soil fertility, saline/sodic conditions and soil–water relationships. The influence of S. plumosum density on grass production was also quantified. It is clear that the distribution (both occurrence and density) of S. plumosum is associated with soil characteristics. The study indicated the sensitivity of S. plumosum towards wet conditions, perennial and transient water tables, overly high soil pH, clay content, high soil fertility (organic matter and phosphate) and sodium chloride. The deeper the soil profile, the more favourable the habitat for S. plumosum, owing to a decrease in waterlogged conditions. The habitat prevalence of S. plumosum is possibly a reflection of not only climatologically wetness but also of topographic wetness. There was no clear general trend for the individual cations along the terrain units. A significant relationship was established between aboveground phytomass production loss of the grass sward and S. plumosum density. These results confirm the threat posted by S. plumosum in semiarid grassland areas, following changes in environmental characteristics.  aPublisher supplied data 3acations 3aflooded conditions 3agrasses 3agrasslands 3ahabitat preferences 3ahabitats 3aorganic matter 3ashrubs 3asodium chloride 3asoil fertility 3asoil pH 3asward 3awater table0 tSouth African journal of botany.g2012 July, v. 81 p.34-39dElsevier B.V.x0254-62997nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.sajb.2012.05.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02205naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001700140245008600157300001800243520101300261592002801274650001801302650002101320650001801341650001901359650002001378650001301398650000701411650001301418650001701431650002201448650001101470700001501481700001901496700001601515700002701531700001301558773014101571856007401712852000901786655001201795IND60671271520221118181112.0191002e20151104xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067127152DNAL7 a10.1039/c5tb00757g2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGulzar, Arif10aStimuli responsive drug delivery application of polymer and silica in biomedicine  ap. 8599-8622.  aIn the last decade, using polymer and mesoporous silica materials as efficient drug delivery carriers has attracted great attention. Although the development and application of them involves some inevitable barriers, such as chronic toxicities, long-term stability, understanding of the biological fate and physiochemical properties, biodistribution, effect in the biological environment, circulation properties and targeting efficacy in vivo. The construction of stimuli responsive drug carriers using biologically safe materials, followed by hydrophilic modification, bioconjugation, targeting functionalization, and detailed safety analysis in small/large animal models may be the best way to overcome these barriers. Huge progress has been made in stimuli responsive drug delivery systems based on polymer and mesoporous silica materials, mainly including pH-, thermo-, light-, enzyme-, redox-, magnetic field- and ultrasound-responsive drug delivery systems, all of which are highlighted in this review.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal models 3achemical bonding 3adrug carriers 3ahydrophilicity 3amagnetic fields 3amedicine 3apH 3apolymers 3aporous media 3asafety assessment 3asilica1 aGai, Shili1 aYang, Piaoping1 aLi, Chunxia1 aAnsari, Mohd Bismillah1 aLin, Jun0 tJournal of materials chemistry B.g2015 Nov. 4, v. 3, no. 44 p.8599-8622dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26902x2050-75187nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c5tb00757g3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02498naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001300147245011100160300001600271500001500287520115100302592002801453650003201481650002801513650001201541650001501553650000801568650001001576650002101586650001301607650001801620650002001638650001401658650001001672651001001682653002301692700001501715700001701730700001301747700001401760700001401774700001201788700001801800700001401818773008201832856008101914852000901995655001202004IND60574655920221117234521.0170728e201708  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057465592DNAL7 a10.1007/s11262-017-1454-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYin, Yue12aA live gI/gE-deleted pseudorabies virus (PRV) protects weaned piglets against lethal variant PRV challenge  ap. 565-572.  a2019-12-06  aEmerging pseudorabies virus (PRV) variant has led to frequent outbreaks of PRV infection among Bartha-K61-vaccinated swine population in Chinese swine farms and caused high mortality in pigs of all age since late 2011. Here, we generated a gE/gI-deleted PRV (rPRVXJ-delgI/gE-EGFP) based on PRV variant strain (PRV-XJ) through homologous DNA recombination. Compared to parental strain, rPRVXJ-delgI/gE-EGFP showed similar growth kinetics in vitro. Its safety and immunogenicity were evaluated in weaned piglets. Our results showed that piglets immunized with rPRVXJ-delgI/gE-EGFP did not exhibit any clinical symptoms, and a high level of gB-specific antibody was detected. After lethal challenge with variant PRV (PRV-FJ strain), all vaccinated piglets survived without showing any clinical symptoms except slight fever within 7 days post-challenge. In unvaccinated piglets, typical clinical symptoms of pseudorabies were observed, and the piglets were all died at 5 days post-challenge. These results indicated that a live rPRVXJ-delgI/gE-EGFP vaccine could be a maker vaccine candidate to control the currently epidemic pseudorabies in China.  aPublisher supplied data 3alivestock and meat industry 3aSuid alphaherpesvirus 1 3apiglets 3aantibodies 3aDNA 3afarms 3aAujeszky disease 3avaccines 3agrowth models 3aimmune response 3amortality 3afever 3aChina 0aSuid herpesvirus 11 aXu, Zhiwen1 aLiu, Xiaowan1 aLi, Ping1 aYang, Fan1 aZhao, Jun1 aFan, Yi1 aSun, Xiangang1 aZhu, Ling0 tVirus genes.g2017 Aug., v. 53, no. 4 p.565-572dSpringer USx0920-85697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11262-017-1454-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02765naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002000143245013800163300001400301520127400315592002801589650001201617650001701629650002201646650002001668650003501688650003101723650001901754650001301773650001701786650001801803650001701821650001701838650001301855650002201868650002401890651001001914653001301924653001301937653001501950653001801965653002401983653002102007700001702028700002102045773010702066856007702173852000902250655001202259IND60595011120221119233549.0180620e20180301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059501112DNAL7 a10.2478/ffp-2018-00072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGoparaju, Laxmi10aSpatial Analysis of Wildlife Habitat around Madihan forests of Mirzapur district, Uttar Pradesh in India, using Geospatial Technology  ap. 73-79.  aThe tropical dry deciduous forests of Mirzapur district in Uttar Pradesh (state) in India are facing to severe threat from agricultural expansion, increased urbanisation, infrastructure development and unsustainable use of forest produce. The forests are nowadays fragmented and wildlife habitat is vanishing. Decreasing numbers of wild animal species requires using methods for preventing the loss of biodiversity. The present study concerns analysis of satellite remote sensing data of Landsat OLI (2013) in conjunction with Geographic Information System (GIS) and support of Geographic Positioning System (GPS) to identify suitable habitat for wild animals. The thematic maps regarding e.g. land use, forest cover type were prepared. The weighted overlay method was used for integration of the thematic layers for identification of potential habitat and corridors for wildlife movement. Most suitable (2.54%), moderately suitable (12.0%) and least suitable (16.20%) areas were delineated and represented in a map. Highly suitable habitat was found at Dadri and Kotwa forest; moderately suitable habitat was found in Darhi Ram forests. Least suitable areas were found in Kotwa and Patewar forests. Such data are the basis to assess the wildlife conservation measures.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLandsat 3abiodiversity 3adeciduous forests 3aforest products 3ageographic information systems 3aglobal positioning systems 3ainfrastructure 3aland use 3aspatial data 3athematic maps 3aurbanization 3awild animals 3awildlife 3awildlife habitats 3awildlife management 3aIndia 0awildlife 0aMirzapur 0aGeospatial 0adry deciduous 0ahabitat suitability 0aweighted overlay1 aAhmad, Firoz1 aSinha, Debadityo0 tFolia forestalia Polonica.g2018 Mar. 1, v. 60, no. 1 p.73-79dSciendowJournal:14917x2199-59077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2478/ffp-2018-00073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03096naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001900152245010500171300001600276520142800292592002801720650001601748650001101764650001801775650001001793650002001803650001401823650001901837650001301856650001601869650001001885650001401895653000801909653000701917653000701924653000701931653000801938653000701946653000701953653003001960653002301990653002202013653002102035700005802056700001702114700001702131700001602148700005702164700001802221700003702239700001802276700001802294773009802312856008702410852000902497655001202506IND60541242420221119054218.0190318e201504  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054124242DNAL7 a10.1016/j.plantsci.2015.01.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJeong, Suyeong10aRootin, a compound that inhibits root development through modulating PIN-mediated auxin distribution  ap. 116-126.  aPlant roots anchor the plant to the soil and absorb water and nutrients for growth. Understanding the molecular mechanisms regulating root development is essential for improving plant survival and agricultural productivity. Extensive molecular genetic studies have provided important information on crucial components for the root development control over the last few decades. However, it is becoming difficult to identify new regulatory components in root development due to the functional redundancy and lethality of genes involved in root development. In this study, we performed a chemical genetic screen to identify novel synthetic compounds that regulate root development in Arabidopsis seedlings. The screen yielded a root growth inhibitor designated as ‘rootin’, which inhibited Arabidopsis root development by modulating cell division and elongation, but did not significantly affect shoot development. Transcript analysis of phytohormone marker genes revealed that rootin preferentially altered the expression of auxin-regulated genes. Furthermore, rootin reduced the accumulation of PIN1, PIN3, and PIN7 proteins, and affected the auxin distribution in roots, which consequently may lead to the observed defects in root development. Our results suggest that rootin could be utilized to unravel the mechanisms underlying root development and to investigate dynamic changes in PIN-mediated auxin distribution.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArabidopsis 3aauxins 3acell division 3agenes 3agenetic markers 3anutrients 3aplant hormones 3aproteins 3aroot growth 3aroots 3aseedlings 0aABA 0aBR 0aCK 0aGA 0aRAM 0aSL 0aQC 0aAbundance of PIN proteins 0aAuxin transporters 0aChemical genetics 0aRoot development1 aKim, Jun-Young1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4569-140X1 aChoi, Hyunmo1 aKim, Hyunmin1 aLee, Ilhwan1 aSoh, Moon-Soo1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4430-516X1 aNam, Hong Gil1 aChang, Yŏng-t'aec(Logistician)1 aLim, Pyung Ok1 aWoo, Hye Ryun0 tPlant science.g2015 Apr., v. 233 p.116-126dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl38764x0168-94527nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.plantsci.2015.01.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02455naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002300145245018400168300001600352520115100368592002801519650002001547650001301567650002101580650001301601650001001614650001501624650001601639650001301655651001201668700002201680700001901702700002101721700002301742700002001765700002001785700002501805700002301830700002101853773009001874856004801964852000902012655001202021IND4467387720221123022342.0121003e201201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446738772DNAL7 a10.1007/s00227-011-1793-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aArendt, Michael D.10aDistributional patterns of adult male loggerhead sea turtles (Caretta caretta) in the vicinity of Cape Canaveral, Florida, USA during and after a major annual breeding aggregation  ap. 101-112.  aSatellite transmitters were attached to 25 reproductively active and four inactive adult male loggerhead sea turtles (86.6–107.0 cm SCLmin) captured from the Port Canaveral, FL, USA shipping channel to assess horizontal and vertical distributions. During the breeding period, male loggerheads aggregated (44% of 755 turtle days) in a 117.6 km2 core area that encompassed the shipping channel. Median dive duration during the breeding period was 27 min (IQR = 15–42 min) and males spent 4% (IQR = 3–5%) of the time at the surface, with significantly shorter dives associated with reproductively active males. Migrant and resident males dispersed concurrently, with residents shifting > 30 km east across the continental shelf over a more protracted departure schedule than migrants. Dive duration and time spent at the surface increased through the fall. Cluster analysis revealed the strongest association for dive duration with sea state during and after the breeding period, with significantly longer dives during more turbulent conditions.

The observed effect of supplementation, described in terms of relative risk (RR), was RR =0.77 (95% confidence interval 0.68–0.88; p < .001) and did not differ by sex or age. However, the number of lives saved was greater at younger ages because of higher mortality. A significant RR was shown for deaths attributed to diarrhoea and measles, but not for respiratory infection. Variability among the trials in effects was apparent, but attempts to explain it by descriptors of the population (baseline anthropometric status, prevalence of xerophthalmia, age profile, baseline mortality) were unsuccessful. Owing to the lack of data, firm conclusions could not be reached about effectiveness in children of less than six months and in settings where biochemical but not clinical evidence of vitamin A deficiency exists. Information about morbidity outcomes from about two dozen studies was reviewed. No consistent effects on frequency or prevalence of diarrhoeal and respiratory infections were found. Improvement in vitamin A status did appear to reduce severe morbidity, particularly in children with measles.  aPublisher supplied data 3achildren 3aconfidence interval 3adeveloping countries 3adiarrhea 3ameasles 3ameta-analysis 3amorbidity 3amortality 3arelative risk 3arespiratory tract diseases 3asigns and symptoms (animals and humans) 3avitamin A 3avitamin A deficiency 3avitamin status 3axerophthalmia1 aMartorell, Reynaldo1 aAronson, Kristan A.1 aEdmonston, Barry1 aRoss, George McCabe.

The integration of lignin with synthetic and engineering plastics is an important approach to develop sustainable polymers. However, it is challenging to blend lignin with other polymers due to its brittle nature and poor dispersion in many composites. In order to improve the miscibility and compatibility of lignin with other plastics, a series of poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) grafted lignin copolymers were prepared from atom transfer radical polymerization. The chain length of PMMA oligomers and glass transition temperature of the lignin copolymers was controlled by varying the lignin: methyl methacrylate ratio. The lignin mass fractions in the copolymers varied from 5.6% to 46.1%. These lignin–PMMA copolymers were further blended with poly(ε-caprolactone) (PCL) and engineered into nanofibrous composites by electrospinning. Tensile test and dynamical mechanical analysis showed that the incorporation of lignin–PMMA copolymers significantly improved the tensile strength, Young's modulus, and storage modulus of the resulting nanofibrous composites. The length of the PMMA chain played a crucial role in the miscibility of lignin in PCL, and therefore enhanced the stiffness and ultimate elongation of the resulting nanofibers. Cell culture studies suggested that these PCL/lignin–PMMA nanofibers were biocompatible and promoted the proliferation, attachment and interactions of human dermal fibroblasts. With reinforced mechanical properties and good biocompatibility, these green and stretchable electrospun nanofibers are potentially useful as biomaterial substrates for biomedical applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiocompatibility 3abiocompatible materials 3abiopolymers 3abrittleness 3acell culture 3acomposite polymers 3afibroblasts 3aglass transition temperature 3ahumans 3alactones 3alignin 3amixing 3amodulus of elasticity 3ananofibers 3apetroleum 3aplastics 3apolymerization 3apolymethylmethacrylate 3astorage modulus 3atensile strength1 aJiang, Shan1 aLow, Zhi Wei1 aLoh, Xian Jun0 tJournal of materials chemistry B.g2015 July 22, v. 3, no. 30 p.6194-6204dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26902x2050-75187nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c5tb00765h3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03619naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004600094040001800140100006200158245018800220300001600408520218200424592002802606650001102634650001002645650001502655650001402670650001002684650001102694650001402705650002002719650002002739650001102759653001302770653001802783653001902801653001202820653001102832700002102843700002302864700002402887700002002911700002702931773010102958856009303059852000903152655001203161IND60747142820221120184417.0210904e20211001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074714282DNAL7 a10.1016/j.theriogenology.2021.06.0222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAbouelela, Yara S.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1468-851510aOvarian, uterine and luteal hemodynamic variations between pregnant and non-pregnant pluriparous Egyptian buffalos with special reference to their anatomical and histological features  ap. 173-182.  aThis study determined the ovarian, uterine, and luteal hemodynamic variations using Doppler between pregnant and non-pregnant pluriparous buffalos in relation to their anatomical and histological basics during the first 31 days after natural mating. Adult healthy cyclic Egyptian buffalo (n = 10) were selected and categorized into two groups; group 1 (n = 5) was mated naturally by a fertile bull during the late estrus phase, and group 2 (n = 5) was not mated. Animals were subjected to Doppler ultrasonography to evaluate luteal, ovarian, and uterine blood flows from day 7 until day 31 post-mating. Besides, three pregnant (one month) and other non-pregnant uterus (n = 6) were obtained from a local abattoir to study the anatomical and histological features. Our results revealed that the luteal, ovarian, and uterine arteries cross-sectional diameters/mm increased (P < 0.05) from day 7 till day 31. Resistance (RI) and pulsatility indices (PI) decreased linearly (P < 0.05) in pregnant buffalos till day 31, but the peak systolic, end diastolic velocities and flow volume of those arteries were increased. Additionally, luteal colored areas away and toward CL were increased (P < 0.05) in the pregnant group compared to non-pregnant ones. There was a significant (P < 0.05) increase in the lumen diameter of luteal, ovarian, and uterine artery sections in pregnant buffalos compared to those of non-pregnant ones. While the mean value of tunica media's thickness of both luteal and uterine artery was significantly higher in non-pregnant buffalos than pregnant ones, except for that of the ovarian artery. Additionally, the ovarian and uterine artery tunica muscularis relative area % was (P < 0.05) higher in pregnant buffalos than in non-pregnant ones, except for that of the luteal artery. It was concluded that in pregnant buffalos, ovarian, uterine, and luteal blood flows were improved from the first week until 31 days post-mating via a decline in both Doppler indices with an increase in Doppler velocities and blood flow volume in relation to their histological changes based on their anatomical architecture in comparison to non-pregnant one.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadults 3ablood 3ablood flow 3abuffaloes 3abulls 3aestrus 3ahistology 3aslaughterhouses 3aultrasonography 3auterus 0aBuffalos 0aLuteal artery 0aOvarian artery 0aDoppler 0aPixels1 aYasin, Noha A.E.1 aEl karmoty, Amr F.1 aKhattab, Mohamed A.1 aEl-Shahat, K.H.1 aAbdelnaby, Elshymaa A.0 tTheriogenology.g2021 Oct. 01, v. 173 p.173-182dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl5209x0093-691X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.theriogenology.2021.06.0223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02861naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094024003000121040001800151100002200169245006500191300001600256500002000272520141400292592002801706650001201734650001101746650001101757650002401768650001201792650002001804650001201824650002601836650001601862650001001878650002501888650001901913650001001932651001301942651001101955700006201966700005702028700002902085700002002114700002302134773011602157856007302273961001202346852000902358655001202367IND60603333320221117071404.0180713e201808  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060333332DNAL7 a10.1111/nph.151102doi7 a10.1111/nph.151102chorus  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLeitold, Veronika13aEl Niño drought increased canopy turnover in Amazon forests  ap. 959-971.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aAmazon droughts, including the 2015–2016 El Niño, may reduce forest net primary productivity and increase canopy tree mortality, thereby altering both the short‐ and the long‐term net forest carbon balance. Given the broad extent of drought impacts, inventory plots or eddy flux towers may not capture regional variability in forest response to drought. We used multi‐temporal airborne Lidar data and field measurements of coarse woody debris to estimate patterns of canopy turnover and associated carbon losses in intact and fragmented forests in the central Brazilian Amazon between 2013–2014 and 2014–2016. Average annualized canopy turnover rates increased by 65% during the drought period in both intact and fragmented forests. The average size and height of turnover events was similar for both time intervals, in contrast to expectations that the 2015–2016 El Niño drought would disproportionally affect large trees. Lidar–biomass relationships between canopy turnover and field measurements of coarse woody debris were modest (R² ≈ 0.3), given similar coarse woody debris production and Lidar‐derived changes in canopy volume from single tree and multiple branch fall events. Our findings suggest that El Niño conditions accelerated canopy turnover in central Amazon forests, increasing coarse woody debris production by 62% to 1.22 Mg C ha⁻¹ yr⁻¹ in drought years .  aPublisher supplied data 3aEl Nino 3acanopy 3acarbon 3acoarse woody debris 3adrought 3aeddy covariance 3aforests 3ahabitat fragmentation 3ainventories 3alidar 3aprimary productivity 3atree mortality 3atrees 3aAmazonia 3aBrazil1 aMorton, Douglas C.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2226-11241 aLongo, Marcos1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5062-62451 ados‐Santos, Maiza Nara1 aKeller, Michael1 aScaranello, Marcos0 tnew phytologist.g2018 Aug., v. 219, no. 3 p.959-971dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl44665x0028-646X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/nph.151103Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/FS  aDNAL 7aarticle03665naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002500143245011300168300001800281520210100299592002802400650002302428650001302451650001202464650002502476650000902501650002002510650001402530650002002544650001602564650002102580650001502601650001302616651001002629651001902639651001202658653002302670653003802693653002602731653002802757653002902785653001202814700001802826700002402844700002202868700001402890700001802904773012702922856007703049852000903126655001203135IND60517175220221120060623.0160328e201511  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051717522DNAL7 a10.4141/cjps-2015-0562doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBadu-Apraku, Baffour10aConsistency of performance of early-maturing maize cultivars in Striga-infested and Striga-free environments  ap. 1073-1084.  aBadu-Apraku, B., Yallou, C., Oyekunle, M., Akinwale, R., Aweke, G. and Kamara, A. 2015. Consistency of performance of early-maturing maize cultivars inStriga-infested andStriga-free environments. Can. J. Plant Sci. 95: 1073–1084. Despite the immense potential of maize (Zea mays L.) in savannas of West and Central Africa (WCA), production and productivity is constrained by Striga hermonthica parasitism. Sixteen early-maturing cultivars were evaluated at two locations in Nigeria and three locations in the Republic of Benin from 2007 to 2009 to assess the grain yield, stability and the consistency of the rankings of the cultivars under Striga-infested and Striga-free environments. The combined analysis of variance showed significant (P<0.01) cultivar and cultivar×environment interactions for grain yield and other traits under Striga-infested and Striga-free environments. The test of concordance was significant (P<0.001) for grain yield (W=0.68), number of emerged Striga plants (W=0.74) and Striga damage (W=0.56) under Striga infestation, indicating stability of resistance in the cultivars developed from diverse sources under artificial S. hermonthica infestation across environments. There was high consistency of the rankings of the cultivars for grain yield and other Striga-resistance traits under Striga-infested and Striga-free environments in Benin and Nigeria. The additive main effects and multiplicative interaction (AMMI) biplot analysis for grain yield revealed POOL15SR/ACR94TZECOMP5-W/ACR94TZECOMP5-W and 2004 TZE-Y Pop DT STR C4 as the most stable cultivars with above-average mean grain yield in Striga-infested environments and they can be combined with other crop management options to control the parasite in the Striga endemic environments. Cultivars TZE Comp 5-W C7F2 and TZE Comp5-Y C6 S6 (Set B) had less Striga damage and number of emerged Striga plants across test environments. These cultivars could therefore serve as unique sources of favorable alleles for improving Striga resistance in maize in different production environments and farming systems.  aPublisher supplied data 3aStriga hermonthica 3aZea mays 3aalleles 3aanalysis of variance 3acorn 3acrop management 3acultivars 3afarming systems 3agrain yield 3aparasitic plants 3aparasitism 3asavannas 3aBenin 3aCentral Africa 3aNigeria 0aStriga infestation 0agenotype×environment interaction 0ahost plant resistance 0aearly-maturing cultivar 0astability of performance 0asavanna1 aYallou, Chabi1 aOyekunle, Muhyideen1 aAkinwale, Richard1 aAweke, G.1 aKamara, Alpha0 tCanadian journal of plant science.g2015 Nov., v. 95, no. 6 p.1073-1084dAgricultural Institute of Canadax1918-18337nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.4141/cjps-2015-0563Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02613naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004000111040001800151100002700169245010300196300001400299500001500313520089000328592002801218650001601246650002501262650001201287650002401299650001301323650000901336650001101345650001401356650001801370650001601388650002001404650001601424650002301440650002801463650001601491650002201507650001401529650002601543650002701569650002601596650001501622650002201637650002801659650001501687650003101702650002101733650002101754653001501775700002101790700001901811773008601830856008601916852000902002655001202011IND4467027120221121073129.0141110e201204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446702712DNAL7 a222970492pmid7 a10.1016/j.biortech.2012.01.0182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGütsch, Jenny Sabrina10aComparative evaluation of autohydrolysis and acid-catalyzed hydrolysis of Eucalyptus globulus wood  ap. 77-85.  a2019-12-06  aThree different acids (acetic, oxalic and sulfuric acid) were tested for their catalytic activity during the pretreatment of Eucalyptus globulus wood comparatively to autohydrolysis in order to extract valuable products prior to kraft pulping and to reduce lignin precipitation in the pretreatment step. The utilization of oxalic and sulfuric acid reduces treatment temperatures at a given wood yield as compared to autohydrolysis and acetic acid addition and thus decreases the insoluble lignin content in the hydrolyzates. Due to the high temperatures of autohydrolysis xylose dehydration to furfural occurs at high wood yield losses, while during acid catalyzed hydrolysis degradation of cellulose to glucose is more pronounced. The main difference between the acid catalyzed and non-catalyzed reaction constitutes the ratio of monomeric xylose and xylooligosaccharides in solution.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetic acid 3axylooligosaccharides 3aglucose 3aEucalyptus globulus 3afurfural 3awood 3axylose 3acellulose 3akraft pulping 3aoxalic acid 3aacid hydrolysis 3atemperature 3acatalytic activity 2aAcetic Acidxmetabolism 2aAcetylation 2aAcidsxmetabolism 2aCatalysis 2aCellulosexmetabolism 2aEucalyptusxmetabolism 2aFuraldehydexanalysis 2aHydrolysis 2aLigninxchemistry 2aOxalic Acidxmetabolism 2aSolubility 2aSulfuric Acidsxmetabolism 2aWoodxmetabolism 2aXylansxanalysis 0ahydrolysis1 aNousiainen, Tiia1 aSixta, Herbert0 tBioresource technology.g2012 Apr., v. 109 p.77-85dElsevier Ltdx0960-85247nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2012.01.0183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02514naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100002600141245014500167520136100312592002801673650001901701650001401720650002001734650001001754650001501764650001701779650001101796650001301807650002001820650001001840650001601850700002201866700002001888700002601908773012101934856007602055852000902131655001202140IND60760553020221122233902.0211223e20211210xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076055302DNAL7 a10.3390/ani111235272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAyala, María Dolores10aPilot Study of the Influence of Equine Assisted Therapy on Physiological and Behavioral Parameters Related to Welfare of Horses and Patients  aDifferent welfare indicators were studied in three patients with psychomotor alterations and in two horses throughout 9–10 equine assisted therapy sessions in each patient. In horses, heart and respiratory rates, blood pressure, temperature and behavioral signs were studied. In patients, heart rate, oxygen saturation, temperature, sleep quality, psychomotor and emotional parameters were analyzed. Data collection was recorded in the anticipatory phase (15 min before the start of the session), two interaction phases (after 30 min of horse-patient interaction on the ground and on horseback, respectively) and the recovery phase (15 min after the end of the session). During the anticipatory phase, most of physiological parameters of patients and horses and the stress behavioral signs of horses increased, followed by a relaxing phase during the horse-patient interaction on the ground. In horse-patient riding phase the heart and respiratory rates of the horses again increased. These results showed that the horses did not seem to suffer stress attributable to the therapy sessions, but only an increase in their parameters associated with activity and external stimuli. The patients improved their gross and fine motor skills, their cognitive and perceptual-sensitive parameters and it led to an improvement in the life quality of their families.  aPublisher supplied data 3ablood pressure 3acognition 3adata collection 3aheart 3aheart rate 3ahippotherapy 3aoxygen 3apatients 3aquality of life 3asleep 3atemperature1 aCarrillo, Andrea 1 aIniesta, Pilar 1 aFerrer Gibert, Pedro,0 tAnimals.g2021 Dec. 10, v. 11, no. 12dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2274x2076-26157nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ani111235273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02571naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001600143245011400159300001600273520118700289592002801476650002501504650002301529650002201552650002901574650001001603650001701613650001401630650000901644650001001653650001201663650001501675650000901690650001201699650001701711650001801728650002201746650001001768651001101778653001901789653001201808653001201820653001701832700002301849773011801872856007801990852000902068655001202077IND60595011520180925000000.0180620e20171201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059501152DNAL7 a10.1515/frp-2017-00332doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGryz, Jakub10aMammals in the diet of tawny owl Strix aluco in western part of Skierniewice Forest District (central Poland)  ap. 297-302.  aThe aim of the study was to describe the species diversity of small mammals in the western part of the Skierniewice Forest District (Central Poland) using tawny owl (Strix aluco) pellets. The landscape itself is a field and forest mosaic with small forest complexes. Four forest complexes with an area between 70 and 750 ha and surrounded by arable lands as well as loosely scattered buildings were chosen to carry out our work in. Owl pellets were collected in the years 2014–2016 and examined for small mammal remains employing standard protocols. Altogether, we identified 963 items belonging to 17 different mammalian prey species. The most numerous was the yellow-necked mouse, Apodemus flavicollis, which accounted for 33.5% of all identified items. As the second most important group, voles (Microtus spp.) accounted for 12.8% of all identified mammals. Unfortunately, we were unable to find species considered rare in central Poland, i.e. hazel dormouse, Muscardinus avellanarius, European water vole, Arvicola amphibius and field vole, Microtus agrestis. In overall, the species composition of small mammal assemblages in the studied area was similar to adjacent regions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aApodemus flavicollis 3aArvicola amphibius 3aMicrotus agrestis 3aMuscardinus avellanarius 3aStrix 3aarable soils 3abuildings 3adiet 3afeces 3aforests 3alandscapes 3amice 3apellets 3aprey species 3asmall mammals 3aspecies diversity 3avoles 3aPoland 0acentral Poland 0apellets 0arodents 0asoricomorphs1 aKrauze-Gryz, Dagny0 tLeśne prace badawcze.g2017 Dec. 1, v. 78, no. 4 p.297-302dDe Gruyter OpenwJournal:J000000075x2082-89267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1515/frp-2017-00333Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03317naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002100150245013700171300001600308520167600324592002802000650001702028650002102045650001402066650003102080650001302111650001302124650002402137650001302161650001102174650002402185650002502209650002002234650001302254653003802267653003002305653002002335653002302355653002002378653002402398700002102422700002002443700002102463700002002484700001902504700001902523700005702542773009502599856008402694852000902778655001202787IND60606576720221119131759.0180726e20160515xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060657672DNAL7 a10.1016/j.watres.2016.04.0182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAmarasiri, Mohan10aBacterial histo-blood group antigens contributing to genotype-dependent removal of human noroviruses with a microfiltration membrane  ap. 383-391.  aWe demonstrated the genotype-dependent removal of human norovirus particles with a microfiltration (MF) membrane in the presence of bacteria bearing histo-blood group antigens (HBGAs). Three genotypes (GII.3, GII.4, and GII.6) of norovirus-like particles (NoVLPs) were mixed with three bacterial strains (Enterobacter sp. SENG-6, Escherichia coli O86:K61:B7, and Staphylococcus epidermidis), respectively, and the mixture was filtered with an MF membrane having a nominal pore size of 0.45 μm. All NoVLP genotypes were rejected by the MF membrane in the presence of Enterobacter sp. SENG-6, which excreted HBGAs as extracellular polymeric substances (EPS). This MF membrane removal of NoVLPs was not significant when EPS was removed from cells of Enterobacter sp. SENG-6. GII.6 NoVLP was not rejected with the MF membrane in the presence of E. coli O86:K61:B7, but the removal of EPS of E. coli O86:K61:B7 increased the removal efficiency due to the interaction of NoVLPs with the exposed B-antigen in lipopolysaccharide (LPS) of E. coli O86:K61:B7. No MF membrane removal of all three genotypes was observed when S. epidermidis, an HBGA-negative strain, was mixed with NoVLPs. These results demonstrate that the location of HBGAs on bacterial cells is an important factor in determining the genotype-dependent removal efficiency of norovirus particles with the MF membrane. The presence of HBGAs in mixed liquor suspended solids from a membrane bioreactor (MBR) pilot plant was confirmed by immune-transmission electron microscopy, which implies that bacterial HBGAs can contribute to the genotype-dependent removal of human noroviruses with MBR using MF membrane.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEnterobacter 3aEscherichia coli 3aNorovirus 3aStaphylococcus epidermidis 3aantigens 3abacteria 3aelectron microscopy 3agenotype 3ahumans 3alipopolysaccharides 3amembrane bioreactors 3amicrofiltration 3aporosity 0aExtracellular polymeric substance 0aHisto-blood group antigen 0aHuman norovirus 0aLipopolysaccharide 0aMicrofiltration 0aMembrane bioreactor1 aHashiba, Satoshi1 aMiura, Takayuki1 aNakagomi, Toyoko1 aNakagomi, Osamu1 aIshii, Satoshi1 aOkabe, Satoshi1 aSano, Daisuke1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8075-69720 tWater research.g2016 May 15, v. 95 p.383-391dElsevier LtdwJournal:1966x0043-13547nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.watres.2016.04.0183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02440naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100003300147245009100180300001600271520116500287592002801452650001501480650001001495650001401505650001101519650004201530650001401572650003301586650001801619650002501637650005201662650001201714650001201726651001101738700002201749700001901771700002001790700003601810773008201846856008101928852000902009655001202018IND60574656420221117234137.0170728e201708  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057465642DNAL7 a10.1007/s11262-017-1470-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSilva, João Marcos Fagundes10aDiscovery and molecular characterization of a novel enamovirus, Grapevine enamovirus-1  ap. 667-671.  aIn this study, we describe a novel putative Enamovirus member, Grapevine enamovirus-1 (GEV-1), discovered by high-throughput sequencing (HTS). A limited survey using HTS of 17 grapevines (Vitis spp.) from the south, southeast, and northeast regions of Brazil led to the detection of GEV-1 exclusively on southern plants, infecting four grapevine cultivars (Cabernet Sauvignon, Semillon, CG 90450, and Cabernet franc) with a remarkable identity of around 99% at the nucleotide level. This novel virus was only detected in multiple-virus infected plants exhibiting viral-like symptoms. GEV-1 was also detected on a cv. Malvasia Longa by RT-PCR. We performed graft-transmissibility assays on GEV-1. The organization, products, and cis-acting regulatory elements of GEV-1 genome are also discussed here. The near complete genome sequence of GEV-1 was obtained during the course of this study, lacking only part of the 3′ untranslated terminal region. This is the first report of a virus in the family Luteoviridae infecting grapevines. Based on its genomic properties and phylogenetic analyses, GEV-1 should be classified as a new member of the genus Enamovirus.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEnamovirus 3aVitis 3acultivars 3agenome 3ahigh-throughput nucleotide sequencing 3aphylogeny 3aplant diseases and disorders 3aplant viruses 3aregulatory sequences 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3asurveys 3aviruses 3aBrazil1 aAl Rwahnih, Maher1 aBlawid, Rosana1 aNagata, Tatsuya1 aFajardo, Thor Vinícius Martins0 tVirus genes.g2017 Aug., v. 53, no. 4 p.667-671dSpringer USx0920-85697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11262-017-1470-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03028naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002800150245012200178300001600300520164100316592002801957650002101985650001302006650001502019650000902034650001902043650001502062650001002077650001102087650001302098650001302111650001702124650001602141650001602157650001402173653002002187653002002207653002802227653002102255653001402276700002702290700002802317773011902345856008502464852000902549655001202558IND60535221920221116153207.0190403e20140604xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053522192DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vetmic.2014.02.0432doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPors, Susanne Elisabeth10aVariations in virulence of avian pathogenic Escherichia coli demonstrated by the use of a new in vivo infection model  ap. 368-374.  aSalpingitis and peritonitis are common pathological manifestations observed in egg-laying hens. To improve methods to study these conditions, a surgical model was developed. Initially, eighteen white layers underwent laparotomy with subsequent inoculation of ink, bacteria or sterile broth directly into the oviduct. Eight birds inoculated with 0.1ml blue ink were euthanized immediately after inoculation and the specific site of inoculation was assessed. In all birds, ink was injected into the oviduct between five and seven cm cranial to the isthmus. To demonstrate the use of this approach to cause infection of the oviduct, five birds were inoculated with 8.6×106CFU of a clinical Escherichia coli isolate. Five control birds received broth with no bacteria. Both infected and control birds were euthanized after 48h followed by a post mortem examination. Infected birds showed diffuse fibrino-purulent peritonitis, E. coli was found in pure culture from one or more positions in the oviduct and the liver. Birds receiving sterile broth did not culture positive and demonstrated no gross lesions. Subsequently, 19 birds were inoculated with an isolate of E. coli ST95 and 20 birds with an isolate of E. coli ST141. Major variation in virulence was observed between the two isolates used in relation to clinical signs, gross lesions and histopathology. In contrast to E. coli ST141, E. coli ST95 caused severe clinical signs, epithelial necrosis of the oviduct and purulent salpingitis. The results of the study show the potential of the model in studies of the pathogenesis of infections and virulence of bacteria of the oviduct.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3abacteria 3aepithelium 3ahens 3ahistopathology 3alaparotomy 3aliver 3amodels 3anecrosis 3aoviducts 3apathogenesis 3aperitonitis 3asalpingitis 3avirulence 0aEgg-laying hens 0aInfection model 0aSalpingitis-peritonitis 0aEscherichia coli 0aVirulence1 aOlsen, Rikke Heidemann1 aChristensen, Jens Peter0 tVeterinary microbiology.g2014 June 04, v. 170, no. 3-4 p.368-374dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl8205x0378-11357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vetmic.2014.02.0433Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02717naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001700143245005600160300001800216520140100234592002801635650001301663650001101676650001401687650002601701650002201727650001301749650001201762650001301774650002201787650001501809650001501824650001501839650002001854650002501874651001701899651001201916653003201928653001601960653002301976653001501999700002002014773012702034856007702161852000902238655001202247IND60517175520221120071057.0160328e201511  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051717552DNAL7 a10.4141/cjps-2015-0842doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFarid, Mehdi10aN2 fixation ability of different dry bean genotypes  ap. 1243-1257.  aFarid, M. and Navabi, A. 2015. N₂fixation ability of different dry bean genotypes. Can. J. Plant Sci. 95: 1243–1257. Common bean (Phaseolous vulgaris L.) is generally known as a weak N₂ fixer compared with other legumes. The availability of genetic variation for N₂ fixation potential of common bean supports the idea that symbiotic nitrogen fixation (SNF) in common bean can be improved through breeding. To assess the potential N₂ fixation of selected common bean genotypes, 12 bean varieties including three Andean and nine Middle American were screened for SNF ability and related traits in controlled environments and field trials in Ontario, Canada. A non-nodulating mutant, R99, was used as the reference plant to estimate nitrogen derived from the atmosphere (Ndfa) through the natural ¹⁵N abundance method. Significant variation was found among the bean genotypes for Ndfa and its related traits. Environmental and genotype by environmental effects significantly influenced Ndfa and its related traits. The three Andean bean genotypes were superior to Middle American genotypes for nodulation ability, while the Middle American genotypes were generally stronger nitrogen fixers in optimum soil moisture conditions. In general, nitrogen fixation was found to be significantly associated with seed yield and carbon isotope discrimination, an indicator of water use efficiency.  aPublisher supplied data 3abreeding 3acarbon 3adry beans 3afield experimentation 3agenetic variation 3agenotype 3amutants 3anitrogen 3anitrogen fixation 3anodulation 3aseed yield 3asoil water 3astable isotopes 3awater use efficiency 3aAndes region 3aOntario 0aSymbiotic nitrogen fixation 0acommon bean 0aPhaseolus vulgaris 0anodulation1 aNavabi, Alireza0 tCanadian journal of plant science.g2015 Nov., v. 95, no. 6 p.1243-1257dAgricultural Institute of Canadax1918-18337nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.4141/cjps-2015-0843Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02549naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001900148245008800167300001200255520142000267592002801687650003001715650001801745650001101763650002501774650001401799650002001813650001101833650001301844650001301857650001201870650001501882650001701897651001401914651000901928651001801937773010501955856008202060852000902142655001202151IND60621478720221121034520.0181117e199503  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062147872DNAL7 a10.1177/1564826595016001032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAmador, Manuel10aStrategies for Developing Countries: Experiences in Latin America and the Caribbean  ap. 1-3.  aDeveloping countries face severe poverty, unemployment, low agriculture productivity, unequal distribution of income and consumption, poor sanitation, and illiteracy. These problems are difficult to solve because of lack of resources, industrial backwardness, and the limited extent to which modern science and technology are introduced. Thus it is necessary to reexamine the objectives of development and the values on which they are established. It will not be possible to achieve fair levels of well-being if progress is attempted simply by copying patterns in rich countries rather than through a rational application of those countries’ scientific knowledge and productive technologies. In several countries of Latin America and the Caribbean, the development of technical and human resources and institutions has helped solve several problems. Cuba has made progress in biotechnology and in health, food, agriculture, cattle, fishery, and education, applying its own resources and the creativeness of scientists, technicians, and workers in these fields. These efforts have succeeded notwithstanding the difficulty of gaining access to Western technology and the country's severe financial limitations. A political decision for elaborating a global strategy and setting resources, and testing the technology and evaluating its technical, economic, social, political, and cultural feasibility were necessary.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural productivity 3abiotechnology 3acattle 3adeveloping countries 3afisheries 3ahuman resources 3aincome 3aliteracy 3apolitics 3apoverty 3asanitation 3aunemployment 3aCaribbean 3aCuba 3aLatin America0 tFood and nutrition bulletin.g, v. 16, no. 1 p.1-3dSAGE PublicationswJournal:2034x0379-57217nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1564826595016001033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03331naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002200094024001900116024003400135040001800169100002100187245007400208300001600282500001400298506007600312520164200388592002802030506003702058650001202095650001202107650001202119650001302131650002602144650001702170650002202187650001202209650001202221650001302233650001602246650001402262650001402276650002102290651001202311653000902323653002202332653002102354653002402375653002902399653002202428653002502450700002102475700001902496700001602515700002402531773009602555856008102651852000902732655001202741IND60693261020221207102416.0210116e20120320xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069326102DNAL7 aPMC33354132pmcid7 a225361072pmid7 a10.3897/zookeys.176.23792doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAntonović, Ivan10aTerrestrial isopod community as indicator of succession in a peat bog  ap. 171-188.  aNAL-light  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aTerrestrial isopods were studied in the Dubravica peat bog and surrounding forest in the northwestern Croatia. Sampling was conducted using pitfall traps over a two year period. Studied peat bog has a history of drastically decrease in area during the last five decades mainly due to the process of natural succession and changes in the water level. A total of 389 isopod individuals belonging to 8 species were captured. Species richness did not significantly differ between bog, edge and surrounding forest. High species richness at the bog is most likely the result of progressive vegetation succession, small size of the bog and interspecific relationships, such as predation. With spreading of Molinia grass on the peat bog, upper layers of Sphagnum mosses become less humid and probably more suitable for forest species that slowly colonise bog area. The highest diversity was found at the edge mainly due to the edge effect and seasonal immigration, but also possibly due to high abundance and predator pressure of the Myrmica ants and lycosid spiders at the bog site. The most abundant species were Trachelipus rathkii and Protracheoniscus politus, in the bog area and in the forest, respectively. Bog specific species were not recorded and the majority of the species collected belong to the group of tyrphoneutral species. However, Hyloniscus adonis could be considered as a tyrphoxenous species regarding its habitat preferences. Most of collected isopod species are widespread eurytopic species that usually inhabit various habitats and therefore indicate negative successive changes or degradation processes in the peat bog.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aIsopoda 3aMolinia 3aMyrmica 3aSphagnum 3aecological succession 3aedge effects 3aeurytopic species 3aforests 3agrasses 3ahabitats 3aimmigration 3apeatlands 3apredation 3aspecies richness 3aCroatia 0aEdge 0aseasonal dynamics 0apitfall trapping 0aTrachelipus rathkii 0aProtracheoniscus politus 0aHyloniscus adonis 0atyrphoxenous species1 aBrigić, Andreja1 aSedlar, Zorana1 aBedek, Jana1 aŠoštarić, Renata0 tZooKeys.g2012 Mar. 20, v. 176 p.171-188dPensoft PublisherswJournal:2141x1313-29707nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3897/zookeys.176.23793Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02686naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245013400169300001600303520112200319592002801441650002201469650001601491650001101507650001501518650000901533650001401542650001801556650001901574650001901593650001601612650001201628650001101640650001201651650001801663650002101681653002901702653000901731653000901740653001201749653001901761653002101780653000801801653000801809653000801817653000801825653001701833653001201850653000801862700006101870773009601931856008402027852000902111655001202120IND60606576920221119131521.0180726e20160701xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060657692DNAL7 a10.1016/j.watres.2016.04.0212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aConway, Jon R.10aGravity-driven transport of three engineered nanomaterials in unsaturated soils and their effects on soil pH and nutrient release  ap. 250-260.  aThe gravity-driven transport of TiO2, CeO2, and Cu(OH)2 engineered nanomaterials (ENMs) and their effects on soil pH and nutrient release were measured in three unsaturated soils. ENM transport was found to be highly limited in natural soils collected from farmland and grasslands, with the majority of particles being retained in the upper 0–3 cm of the soil profile, while greater transport depth was seen in a commercial potting soil. Physical straining appeared to be the primary mechanism of retention in natural soils as ENMs immediately formed micron-scale aggregates, which was exacerbated by coating particles with Suwannee River natural organic matter (NOM) which promote steric hindrance. Small changes in soil pH were observed in natural soils contaminated with ENMs that were largely independent of ENM type and concentration, but differed from controls. These changes may have been due to enhanced release of naturally present pH-altering ions (Mg²⁺, H⁺) in the soil via substitution processes. These results suggest ENMs introduced into soil will likely be highly retained near the source zone.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural land 3aceric oxide 3acopper 3agrasslands 3aions 3amagnesium 3ananomaterials 3aorganic matter 3apolluted soils 3apotting mix 3aprotons 3arivers 3asoil pH 3asoil profiles 3atitanium dioxide 0aEngineered nanomaterials 0aTiO2 0aCeO2 0aCu(OH)2 0aSoil transport 0aNutrient release 0aCCC 0aCEC 0aDLS 0aENM 0aESEM-BSE/EDS 0aICP-AES 0aNOM1 aKeller, Arturo A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7638-662X0 tWater research.g2016 July 01, v. 98 p.250-260dElsevier LtdwJournal:1966x0043-13547nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.watres.2016.04.0213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02528naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245007500166300001600241520129100257592002801548650001701576650002801593650001501621650001601636650001101652650001601663650000901679650001201688650001901700650002501719650001701744650002601761650001401787650002201801700001901823700001801842700001801860700001901878700001301897773008201910856008101992852000902073655001202082IND60574656620221117234215.0170728e201708  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057465662DNAL7 a10.1007/s11262-017-1467-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTian, Yuanyuan10aGrass carp reovirus-GD108 fiber protein is involved in cell attachment  ap. 613-622.  aViral attachment to specific host receptors is the first step in viral infection and serves an essential function in the selection of target cells. In this study, structure analysis, neutralization assays, and cell attachment assays were carried out to evaluate the cell attachment functions of the outer capsid fiber protein of grass carp reovirus GD108 strain (GCRV-GD108). The GCRV-GD108 fiber protein contained 512 amino acids encoded by S7 segment and shared sequence similarities with mammalian reovirus cell attachment protein σ1 and adenovirus fiber. Structural analyses predicted the presence of a coiled-coil tail domain, three adenoviral shafts in the body domain, and a globular head domain, similar to other fiber proteins. Neutralization assays showed that polyclonal antibodies against the fiber protein could prevent viral infection in both fish and grass carp snout fibroblast cells (PSF), suggesting that the recombinant fiber protein could induce neutralized antibodies against GCRV-GD108. Cell attachment assays showed that recombinant fiber protein could bind to PSF cells, demonstrating that the fiber protein functioned as the cell attachment protein in GCRV-GD108. These results provided the basis for further studies of the pathogenesis of grass carp reovirus.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAdenoviridae 3aCtenopharyngodon idella 3aReoviridae 3aamino acids 3acapsid 3afibroblasts 3afish 3amammals 3aneutralization 3aneutralization tests 3apathogenesis 3apolyclonal antibodies 3areceptors 3asequence homology1 aJiao, Zhenzhen1 aDong, Junjian1 aSun, Chengfei1 aJiang, Xiaoyan1 aYe, Xing0 tVirus genes.g2017 Aug., v. 53, no. 4 p.613-622dSpringer USx0920-85697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11262-017-1467-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03708naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100001600166245015700182300001800339500001500357520187900372592002802251650001302279650002502292650002402317650002302341650002902364650002102393650002002414650002402434650002902458650002302487650000902510650002602519650001702545650002302562650002802585650002402613650001202637650002302649650001902672650002402691650001402715650002402729650002902753650001202782650000902794651001002803653001102813700001702824700001502841700001602856700001702872773011502889856008103004852000903085655001203094IND50072858620221120142120.0150212e201402  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007285862DNAL7 a239072562pmid7 a10.1007/s00253-013-5104-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYuan, Junji10aMethane production potential and methanogenic archaea community dynamics along the Spartina alterniflora invasion chronosequence in a coastal salt marsh  ap. 1817-1829.  a2019-12-06  aInvasion by the exotic species Spartina alterniflora, which has high net primary productivity and superior reproductive capacity compared with native plants, has led to rapid organic carbon accumulation and increased methane (CH₄) emission in the coastal salt marsh of China. To elucidate the mechanisms underlying this effect, the methanogen community structure and CH₄production potential as well as soil organic carbon (SOC), dissolved organic carbon, dissolved organic acids, methylated amines, aboveground biomass, and litter mass were measured during the invasion chronosequence (0–16 years). The CH₄production potential in the S. alterniflora marsh (range, 2.94–3.95 μg kg⁻¹ day⁻¹) was significantly higher than that in the bare tidal mudflat. CH₄production potential correlated significantly with SOC, acetate, and trimethylamine concentrations in the 0–20 cm soil layer. The abundance of methanogenic archaea also correlated significantly with SOC, and the dominant species clearly varied with S. alterniflora-driven SOC accumulation. The acetotrophic Methanosaetaceae family members comprised a substantial proportion of the methanogenic archaea in the bare tidal mudflat while Methanosarcinaceae family members utilized methylated amines as substrates in the S. alterniflora marsh. Ordination analysis indicated that trimethylamine concentration was the primary factor inducing the shift in the methanogenic archaea composition, and regressive analysis indicated that the facultative family Methanosarcinaceae increased linearly with trimethylamine concentration in the increasingly sulfate-rich salt marsh. Our results indicate that increased CH₄production during the S. alterniflora invasion chronosequence was due to increased levels of the non-competitive substrate trimethylamine and a shift in the methanogenic archaea community.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetates 3aprimary productivity 3asoil organic carbon 3aMethanosarcinaceae 3adissolved organic carbon 3aMethanosaetaceae 3achronosequences 3acommunity structure 3areproductive performance 3aintroduced species 3asoil 3aSpartina alterniflora 3asalt marshes 3amethane production 3aorganic acids and salts 3aaboveground biomass 3amethane 3aindigenous species 3atrimethylamine 2aArchaeaxmetabolism 2aEcosystem 2aMethanexmetabolism 2aMethylaminesxmetabolism 2aPoaceae 2aSoil 3aChina 0acarbon1 aDing, Weixin1 aLiu, Deyan1 aXiang, Jian1 aLin, Yongxin0 tApplied microbiology and biotechnology.g2014 Feb., v. 98, no. 4 p.1817-1829dSpringer-Verlagx0175-75987nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00253-013-5104-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03022naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002400143245006600167300001800233520161600251592002801867650002501895650002401920650002801944650002201972650001601994650002002010650002402030650001502054650001602069650001302085650001502098650001802113650001302131650001802144650001702162650001002179651001202189653001802201653001202219653001802231653001702249700002702266700002202293773012702315856007702442852000902519655001202528IND60517175920221120071138.0160328e201511  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051717592DNAL7 a10.4141/cjps-2015-1142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBelfry, Kimberly D.10aWeed control in soybean using pyroxasulfone and sulfentrazone  ap. 1199-1204.  aBelfry, K.

Pyroxasulfone and sulfentrazone are new herbicides currently being evaluated for weed control in soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] in Ontario, Canada. Seven experiments were conducted over a 3-yr period (2011 to 2013) at Ridgetown and Exeter, Ontario, to evaluate weed management using pyroxasulfone, sulfentrazone and their tank-mixes relative to the industry standard, imazethapyr plus metribuzin. Tank-mixing pyroxasulfone and sulfentrazone provided up to 97, 46, 60, 100 and 71% control of common lambsquarters (Chenopodium album L.), common ragweed (Ambrosia artemisiifolia L.), green foxtail [Setaria viridis (L.) Beauv.], Powell amaranth [Amaranthus powellii (S.) Wats.] and velvetleaf (Abutilon theophrasti Medic.), respectively, at 2 wk after treatment. Control with pyroxasulfone and sulfentrazone was improved when tank-mixed, relative to application of each herbicide separately. Although control was variable across weed species, no difference in control was identified between pyroxasulfone plus sulfentrazone and imazethapyr plus metribuzin. Soybean yield was up to 2.7, 2.4 and 2.9 t ha⁻¹ for pyroxasulfone, sulfentrazone and pyroxasulfone plus sulfentrazone application, yet imazethapyr plus metribuzin provided the highest yield (3.3 t ha⁻¹). This research demonstrates that pyroxasulfone plus sulfentrazone may be used as a valuable weed control option in soybean; however, weed community composition may limit herbicidal utility.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAbutilon theophrasti 3aAmaranthus powellii 3aAmbrosia artemisiifolia 3aChenopodium album 3aGlycine max 3aSetaria viridis 3acommunity structure 3acrop yield 3aimazethapyr 3aindustry 3ametribuzin 3apyroxasulfone 3asoybeans 3asulfentrazone 3aweed control 3aweeds 3aOntario 0aPyroxasulfone 0asoybean 0asulfentrazone 0aweed control1 aMcNaughton, Kristen E.1 aSikkema, Peter H.0 tCanadian journal of plant science.g2015 Nov., v. 95, no. 6 p.1199-1204dAgricultural Institute of Canadax1918-18337nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.4141/cjps-2015-1143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02393naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001800152245010600170520107300276592002801349650002201377650001301399650001901412650001301431650001101444650001401455650001401469650001301483653002101496653002901517653001801546653001801564653002001582700001901602700001501621700001501636700001801651700001901669700002001688700001801708700001301726773010001739856008701839852000901926655001201935IND60730506420221119224808.0220606e20210830xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073050642DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2021.1294992doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPeng, Zhaoxin10aComparative profiling and natural variation of polymethoxylated flavones in various citrus germplasms  aCitrus fruits are the main dietary source of polymethoxylated flavones (PMFs) with significant effects on consumer health. In this study, eleven main PMFs were evaluated in the fruit flavedo or leaves of 116 citrus accessions via UPLC–DAD–ESI-QTOF-MS/MS combined with HPLC–DAD analysis, which revealed significant species-specific and spatiotemporal characteristics. All Citrus reticulata and their natural or artificial hybrids were found to have detectable PMFs, especially in the fruit flavedo of the wild or early-cultivated mandarins at early fruit development stages. However, PMFs were not detected in citrons, pummelos, kumquats, trifoliata oranges, papedas, Chinese box oranges and ‘Mangshanyegan’. The results enlightened that PMF accumulation only in mandarins and mandarin hybrids is a phenotype inherited from mandarin ancestors. This study provides a comprehensive PMF profile in various citrus germplasms and will benefit future functional citrus breeding practices aimed at designing plants rich in total or specific PMFs for health benefits.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCitrus reticulata 3aflavones 3afood chemistry 3afruiting 3afruits 3agermplasm 3aphenotype 3apummelos 0aCitrus germplasm 0aPolymethoxylated flavone 0aChemotaxonomy 0aWild mandarin 0aFunctional food1 aZhang, Haipeng1 aLi, Wenyun1 aYuan, Ziyu1 aXie, Zongzhou1 aZhang, Hongyan1 aCheng, Yunjiang1 aChen, Jiajing1 aXu, Juan0 tFood chemistry.g2021 Aug. 30, v. 354 p.129499-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl8139x0308-81467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2021.1294993Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02852naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002500139245014300164300001800307500002000325520149700345592002801842650002301870650001201893650002201905650001501927650001001942650001201952650001001964650001001974650001401984650001401998650001702012700002202029700002202051700002302073700001702096700002002113700002502133700002202158773011802180856007302298961001402371852000902385655001202394IND60603333920221117071238.0180713e201808  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060333392DNAL7 a10.1111/nph.152152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCavazos, Brittany R.10aTesting the roles of vertical transmission and drought stress in the prevalence of heritable fungal endophytes in annual grass populations  ap. 1075-1084.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aBeneficial inherited symbionts are expected to reach high prevalence in host populations, yet many are observed at intermediate prevalence. Theory predicts that a balance of fitness benefits and efficiency of vertical transmission may interact to stabilize intermediate prevalence. We established populations of grass hosts (Lolium multiflorum) that varied in prevalence of a heritable fungal endophyte (Epichloё occultans), allowing us to infer long‐term equilibria by tracking change in prevalence over one generation. We manipulated an environmental stressor (elevated precipitation), which we hypothesized would reduce the fitness benefits of symbiosis, and altered the efficiency of vertical transmission by replacing endophyte‐positive seeds with endophyte‐free seeds. Endophytes and elevated precipitation both increased host fitness, but symbiont effects were not stronger in the drier treatment, suggesting that benefits of symbiosis were unrelated to drought tolerance. Reduced transmission suppressed the inferred equilibrium prevalence from 42.6% to 11.7%. However, elevated precipitation did not modify prevalence, consistent with the result that it did not modify fitness benefits. Our results demonstrate that failed transmission can influence the prevalence of heritable microbes and that intermediate prevalence can be a stable equilibrium due to forces that allow symbionts to increase (fitness benefits) but prevent them from reaching fixation (failed transmission).  aPublisher supplied data 3aLolium multiflorum 3aannuals 3adrought tolerance 3aendophytes 3afungi 3agrasses 3ahosts 3aseeds 3asymbionts 3asymbiosis 3awater stress1 aBohner, Teresa F.1 aDonald, Marion L.1 aSneck, Michelle E.1 aShadow, Alan1 aOmacini, Marina1 aRudgers, Jennifer A.1 aMiller, Tom E.

Thanks to the unique structure and properties of Pd nanoplates, the antibody of AFP (Ab) was effectively immobilized onto the surface of the Pd nanoplates modified glassy carbon electrode (GCE). Moreover, the good electrochemical properties of Pd nanoplates greatly improved the electronic transmission rate and enhanced the electrochemical signal, which led to an increase of the detection sensitivity. Based on the specific antibody–antigen interaction, a label-free immunosensor based on Pd nanoplates was developed for sensing of AFP. The current method allows us to detect AFP over a wide concentration range from 0.01 to 75.0ng/mL with a detection limit of 4pg/mL. The proposed immunosensor has been used to determine AFP in human serum with satisfactory results.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantibodies 3aantigen-antibody reactions 3abiomarkers 3ablood serum 3adetection limit 3aelectrochemistry 3aglassy carbon electrode 3ahumans 3aimmunoassays 3aimmunosensors 3aneoplasms 0aPalladium nanoplates 0aAlpha-fetoprotein 0aImmunosensor 0aCancer biomarker 0aLabel-free1 aLi, He1 aZhang, Yihe1 aWei, Qin1 aMa, Hongmin1 aWu, Dan1 aLi, Yan1 aZhang, Yong1 aDu, Bin0 tBiosensors & bioelectronics.g2014 Mar. 15, v. 53 p.305-309dElsevier B.V.x0956-56637nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bios.2013.10.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03356naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024003900135040001800174100002300192245010400215500001900319506007600338520165200414592002802066506003702094650002202131650001102153650001002164650001102174650001002185650001802195650000902213650001802222650001502240650001102255650001802266650001602284650001802300650001902318650001402337650001402351653001502365653001702380653003402397653002902431700002502460700004402485700002202529700002002551700003102571773009302602856008602695852000902781655001202790IND60692659420221207131416.0201024e202004  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069265942DNAL7 a323227042pmid7 aPMC71715292pmcid7 a10.1016/j.heliyon.2020.e036612doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFarahatAllam, Amal10aEffect of nitazoxanide and spiramycin metronidazole combination in acute experimental toxoplasmosis  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aSuccessful treatment of Toxoplasma gondii infection is difficult to attain. This study was designed to evaluate the efficacy of sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim (SMZ-TMP), as the reference drug, nitazoxanide (NTZ), spiramycin (SP) and SP-metronidazole against the virulent RH T. gondii strain in acute experimental toxoplasmosis. One hundred Swiss albino mice were divided into control and experimental groups. Each mouse was infected with 2500 tachyzoites. Twenty infected untreated mice were used as control. The experimental group was subdivided into four subgroups (20 mice each); IIa SMZ-TMP, IIb NTZ, IIc SP and IId SP-metronidazole. All drugs were in tablet form, and were administered orally in suspension, for a period of seven days. Assessment of each drug efficacy was achieved through the study of mice survival time, mortality rate, parasite load, viability and morphological studies of tachyzoites by scanning electron microscope (SEM). The obtained results showed that SMZ-TMP, SP and SP-metronidazole were effective against acute murine toxoplasmosis and caused deformities in the tachyzoites ultrastructure. SP-metronidazole gave the best results on both mice survival rate and parasite load in the brain and liver. SMZ-TMP induced formation of prominent filaments extending from the deformed tachyzoites. NTZ showed little effect. In conclusion, all used drugs succeeded to prolong the survival time of the mice. SP-metronidazole gave the foremost effect on both mice survival rate and parasite load in the liver, spleen and brain. As this combination is nontoxic to human, it is promising for the treatment of human toxoplasmosis.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aToxoplasma gondii 3aalbino 3abrain 3ahumans 3aliver 3ametronidazole 3amice 3aparasite load 3aspiramycin 3aspleen 3asurvival rate 3atachyzoites 3atoxoplasmosis 3aultrastructure 3aviability 3avirulence 0aToxicology 0aNitazoxanide 0aSulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim 0aSpiramycin-metronidazole1 aShehab, Amel Youssef1 aFawzy Hussein Mogahed, Nerrmine Mogahed1 aFarag, Hoda Fahmy1 aElsayed, Yasmen1 aAbd El-Latif, Naglaa Fathi0 tHeliyon.g2020 Apr., v. 6, no. 4 p.e03661-dElsevier LtdwJournal:23264x2405-84407nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2020.e036613Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03116naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004000092040001800132100002200150245012200172300001600294520185500310592002802165650001202193650002002205650002302225650001302248650001902261650002302280650001102303650001902314650000902333650001702342650002302359650001402382650001702396651001402413700001302427700001402440700001702454700001502471773010102486856008602587852000902673655001202682IND4461592820221117064309.0141111e201110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446159282DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jaridenv.2011.05.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMuñoz-Robles, C.10aSoil hydrological and erosional responses in areas of woody encroachment, pasture and woodland in semi-arid Australia  ap. 936-945.  aIn arid and semi-arid areas, woody encroachment is the increase in density, cover, extent and/or biomass of woody plants. Woody encroachment is often associated with increased runoff and soil erosion. Hydrological and erosional responses of woody encroachment and of pastures established after management of encroachment in semi-arid Australia are not well understood. This study compared the hydrological and erosional responses across vegetation states comprising woody plant encroachment (>1200 stems ha⁻¹), recently established pastures (<23 years of age), long-established pasture (50–100 years of age) and open woodland (<330 stems ha⁻¹) in semi-arid eastern Australia. Responses were measured using rainfall simulation with intensity of 35 mm h⁻¹ for 30 min applied on 1 -m² plots. Runoff and sediment production did not differ significantly between vegetation states. Average runoff in woody encroachment was 9.0 mm h⁻¹, followed by recent pasture (8.2 mm h⁻¹), long-established pasture (5.9 mm h⁻¹) and open woodland (4.2 mm h⁻¹). Total sediment production in recent pasture was 11.6 g m⁻², followed by woody encroachment (9.0 g m⁻²), long-established pasture (7.3 g m⁻²) and open woodland (4.3 g m⁻²). Runoff and sediment production were significantly lower at one pasture site (0.9 mm h⁻¹ and 1.3 g m⁻²) where rotational grazing and minimum tillage had been implemented than in the adjacent paired woody encroachment site (10.3 mm h⁻¹and 6.5 g m⁻², respectively). This example of a pasture that had been managed to increase ground cover illustrated the effect of pasture management on reducing runoff and sediment production. Across all vegetation states, small scale runoff and sediment production were minimal or zero where total ground cover was 73% or higher.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiomass 3aminimum tillage 3apasture management 3apastures 3arain intensity 3arotational grazing 3arunoff 3asemiarid zones 3asoil 3asoil erosion 3atillage implements 3awoodlands 3awoody plants 3aAustralia1 aReid, N.1 aTighe, M.1 aBriggs, S.V.1 aWilson, B.0 tJournal of arid environments.g2011 Oct., v. 75, no. 10 p.936-945dElsevier Ltdx0140-19637nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jaridenv.2011.05.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02719naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002400146245010200170300001200272520110600284592002801390650004301418650002401461650002801485650001801513650001701531650001401548650001901562650001601581650002501597650001801622650000701640650001501647650001501662650000901677650002301686650001401709650002101723650001401744653001601758653001501774653001801789653001401807653001301821653001901834653001501853700002801868700002301896700002301919700002501942773009601967856008102063852000902144655001202153IND60526358120221121113836.0190405e201602  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052635812DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fm.2015.08.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBevilacqua, Antonio10aUsing physical approaches for the attenuation of lactic acid bacteria in an organic rice beverage  ap. 1-8.  aA wild strain of Lactobacillus plantarum, isolated from an Italian sourdough, was inoculated in an organic rice drink; however, it caused a strong acidification. Thus, it was preliminary processed through homogenization (single or multiple passes) or sonication (US) and then inoculated in the beverage. The samples were stored at 4 °C and analyzed to assess pH, production of lactic acid, viable count and sensory scores. A US-2-step process (power, 80%) could control acidification; viability and sensory traits were never affected by sonication. This result was confirmed on two commercial probiotics (Lactobacillus casei LC01 and Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis Bb12).In the 2nd step samples inoculated with attenuated strains were also stored under thermal abuse conditions (25 or 37 °C for 4 or 24 h, then at 4 °C) and the results showed that US could control acidification for a short thermal abuse. Finally, US-attenuated starter cultures were inoculated in the rice drink containing β-glucans as healthy compounds; the targets did not cause any significant change of prebiotic.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis 3aLactobacillus casei 3aLactobacillus plantarum 3aacidification 3abeta-glucans 3abeverages 3ahomogenization 3alactic acid 3alactic acid bacteria 3aorganic foods 3apH 3aprebiotics 3aprobiotics 3arice 3asensory properties 3asourdough 3astarter cultures 3aviability 0aAttenuation 0aSonication 0aAcidification 0aViability 0aModeling 0aSensory scores 0aRice drink1 aCasanova, Francesco Pio1 aPetruzzi, Leonardo1 aSinigaglia, Milena1 aCorbo, Maria Rosaria0 tFood microbiology.g2016 Feb., v. 53 p.1-8dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl34976x0740-00207nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fm.2015.08.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02508naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006500148245008900213300001600302520141300318592002801731596005401759650001501813650002001828650001601848650001701864650002901881650001401910700001801924700001901942773012901961856008302090852000902173655001202182IND60768078720221121162213.0220726e202203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076807872DNAL7 a10.1007/s10340-021-01425-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aParent, Jean-Philippe1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8425-817710aDisruptive effects of non-specific airborne and substrate-borne vibrations on aphids  ap. 949-958.  aInsects are known to be negatively impacted by noise from anthropogenic sources. Recently, pest control methods have been developed using specific airborne (sound) and substrate-borne vibratory signals. However, there is limited information available on the effects of non-specific vibrations on pest insects, especially those not known to use sound or vibration for communication. Here, we tested whether non-specific substrate-borne or airborne vibrations (white noise) cause reductions in the number of aphids of three species on single plants in short-term (24 h) laboratory trials. Substrate-borne vibrations transmitted through the host plant reduced total numbers of all three species (45 to 62% reductions in total aphid numbers), while airborne vibrations played through speakers had no detectable effect. The effect of substrate-borne vibrations on aphid numbers appeared to be mostly due to inducing aphids to leave the plant, rather than reducing the reproductive output of remaining aphids. To our knowledge, our results provide the first proof-of-concept indicating that non-specific substrate-borne vibrations can affect pests not known to use vibrations to communicate and should be explored further as a physical pest control method. Future research in this area is needed to investigate longer-term effects of non-specific vibrations on pests, their host plants, and their natural enemies.  aPublisher supplied data  aA-BASE J-001752cAgriculture and Agri-Food Canada 3aAphidoidea 3acontrol methods 3ahost plants 3apest control 3areproductive performance 3avibration1 aLaidlaw, Ryan1 aAbram, Paul K.0 tJournal of pest science.g2022 Mar., v. 95, no. 2 p.949-958dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl3870064x1612-47587nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10340-021-01425-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03642naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002200139245016600161300001800327500002000345520177700365592002802142596001002170596004902180650001902229650001802248650001202266650002802278650001702306650001902323650001502342650001002357650001102367650001502378650001102393650002202404650002602426650001202452650002902464650002602493650002002519650002202539650001302561700002102574700002202595700002702617700001902644700002802663700001702691700002302708700002102731700006302752700002702815773011602842856007302958852000903031655001203040IND60666295020221121063523.0190917e201909  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066629502DNAL7 a10.1111/tpj.144192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAmato, Alessandra14aThe MYB5‐driven MBW complex recruits a WRKY factor to enhance the expression of targets involved in vacuolar hyper‐acidification and trafficking in grapevine  ap. 1220-1241.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe accumulation of secondary metabolites and the regulation of tissue acidity contribute to the important traits of grape berry and influence plant performance in response to abiotic and biotic factors. In several plant species a highly conserved MYB–bHLH–WD (MBW) transcriptional regulatory complex controls flavonoid pigment synthesis and transport, and vacuolar acidification in epidermal cells. An additional component, represented by a WRKY‐type transcription factor, physically interacts with the complex increasing the expression of some target genes and adding specificity for other targets. Here we investigated the function of MBW(W) complexes involving two MYBs (VvMYB5a and VvMYB5b) and the WRKY factor VvWRKY26 in grapevine (Vitis vinifera L.). Using transgenic grapevine plants we showed that these complexes affected different aspects of morphology, plant development, pH regulation, and pigment accumulation. Transcriptomic analysis identified a core set of putative target genes controlled by VvMYB5a, VvMYB5b, and VvWRKY26 in different tissues. Our data indicated that VvWRKY26 enhances the expression of selected target genes induced by VvMYB5a/b. Among these targets are genes involved in vacuolar hyper‐acidification, such as the P‐type ATPases VvPH5 and VvPH1, and trafficking, and genes involved in the biosynthesis of flavonoids. In addition, VvWRKY26 is recruited specifically by VvMYB5a, reflecting the functional diversification of VvMYB5a and VvMYB5b. The expression of MBWW complexes in vegetative organs, such as leaves, indicates a possible function of vacuolar hyper‐acidification in the repulsion of herbivores and/or in developmental processes, as shown by defects in transgenic grape plants where the complex is inactivated.  aPublisher supplied data  cCSIRO  aCSP1002cGrape and Wine Research Corporation 3aVitis vinifera 3aacidification 3aacidity 3aadenosinetriphosphatase 3abiosynthesis 3abiotic factors 3aflavonoids 3agenes 3agrapes 3aherbivores 3aleaves 3aplant development 3asecondary metabolites 3atissues 3atranscription (genetics) 3atranscription factors 3atranscriptomics 3atransgenic plants 3avacuoles1 aCavallini, Erika1 aWalker, Amanda R.1 aPezzotti, M.q(Mario),1 aBliek, Mattijs1 aQuattrocchio, Francesca1 aKoes, Ronald1 aRuperti, Benedetto1 aBertini, Edoardo1 aZenoni, S.q(Sara),1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0496-81611 aTornielli, Giovanni B.0 tplant journal.g2019 Sept., v. 99, no. 6 p.1220-1241dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl47643x0960-74127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/tpj.144193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03062naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002000152245009700172300001800269520162000287592002801907650001601935650002301951650002101974650002001995650001902015650002302034650001602057650002502073650001702098650001902115650002302134650001102157650002202168650001002190650001102200650001802211650001402229650000902243650002502252650001302277650001102290650001702301700003702318700002002355773011702375856005502492852000902547655001202556IND4510547220221119091514.0150730e200206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND451054722DNAL7 a10.1046/j.1432-1033.2002.02931.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGavidia, Isabel10aCloning and expression of two novel aldoâketo reductases from Digitalis purpurea leaves  ap. 2842-2850.  aThe aldoâketo reductase (AKR) superfamily comprises proteins that catalyse mainly the reduction of carbonyl groups or carbonâcarbon double bonds of a wide variety of substrates including steroids. Such types of reactions have been proposed to occur in the biosynthetic pathway of the cardiac glycosides produced by Digitalis plants. Two cDNAs encoding leafâspecific AKR proteins (DpAR1 and DpAR2) were isolated from a D.âpurpurea cDNA library using the rat Î4â3âketosteroid 5Î²âreductase clone. Both cDNAs encode 315 amino acid proteins showing 98.4% identity. DpAR proteins present high identities (68â80%) with four Arabidopsis clones and a 67% identity with the aldose/aldehyde reductase from Medicago sativa. A molecular phylogenetic tree suggests that these seven proteins belong to a new subfamily of the AKR superfamily. Southern analysis indicated that DpARs are encoded by a family of at most five genes. RNAâblot analyses demonstrated that the expression of DpAR genes is developmentally regulated and is restricted to leaves. The expression of DpAR genes has also been induced by wounding, elevated salt concentrations, drought stress and heatâshock treatment. The isolated cDNAs were expressed in Escherichia coli and the recombinant proteins purified. The expressed enzymes present reductase activity not only for various sugars but also for steroids, preferring NADH as a cofactor. These studies indicate the presence of plant AKR proteins with ketosteroid reductase activity. The function of the enzymes in cardenolide biosynthesis is discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArabidopsis 3aDigitalis purpurea 3aEscherichia coli 3aMedicago sativa 3aNAD (coenzyme) 3aaldehyde reductase 3aamino acids 3abiochemical pathways 3abiosynthesis 3acDNA libraries 3acardiac glycosides 3aclones 3acomplementary DNA 3agenes 3aleaves 3anew subfamily 3aphylogeny 3arats 3arecombinant proteins 3asteroids 3asugars 3awater stress1 aPÃ©rezâBermÃºdez, Pedro1 aSeitz, H Ulrich0 tEuropean journal of biochemistry.g2002 June, v. 269, no. 12 p.2842-2850dBlackwell Science Ltdx0014-29567nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1432-1033.2002.02931.x  aDNAL 7aarticle04398naa a2200865 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002800147245010200175520176900277592002802046650002302074650002102097650001502118650001302133650001702146650001902163650001802182650003002200650001002230650001902240650001102259650000902270650001602279650002502295650005202320653002302372653004502395653003102440653001602471653002502487653002402512653002502536653001702561653002502578653001902603653002202622653001802644653002202662653001502684653002202699653002502721653002602746653001902772653002402791653001302815653002502828653001302853653002502866653001302891653002502904653005202929653002302981653001103004653002403015653001103039653002403050653001403074653002403088653001603112653002503128653001403153653002203167700002003189700006003209700002703269700001703296773011603313856008203429852000903511655001203520IND60730733520221123045009.0220606e20210612xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073073352DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jep.2021.1139902doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAhmadimoghaddam, Davoud10aBupleurum falcatum L. alleviates nociceptive and neuropathic pain: Potential mechanisms of action  aIn Iranian folkloric medicine, Bupleurum falcatum L. (Chinese Thoroughwax) has been used as a selective analgesic remedy for several centuries. The current research was conducted to explore the anti-nociceptive and anti-allodynic action of Bupleurum falcatum L. roots essential oil (BFEO) in Swiss mice. Formalin-induced paw licking (FIPL) model was applied for exploring of BFEO antinociceptive effects (neurogenic or inflammatory pain). The involvements of L-arginine–NO–cGMP-KATP channel pathway and several receptors such as opioid, peroxisome proliferator-activated (PPA), cannabinoid, transient receptor potential vanilloid, and adrenergic receptors were assesses to detect the anti-nociceptive activity of BFEO. Cervical spinal cord contusion (CSC) paradigm was employed for induction of neuropathic pain. BFEO (100 mg/kg), in the FIPL model, produced significant antinociception compared to the control mice (p < 0.01). Furthermore, L-arginine, methylene blue, glibenclamide, naloxonazine, GW9662, and SR141716A pre-treatments restored the BFEO anti-nociceptive effects (p < 0.05) in the FIPL (second phase) test (p < 0.05). Intraperitoneal administration of saikosaponin A (one of the main constituents of BFEO) partially alleviated (p < 0.05) pain in FIPL test. Likewise, in CSC mice, the von Frey assay exhibited that BFEO could alter mechanical allodynia. Finally, it seems that, in male mice, BFEO has both anti-allodynic and anti-nociceptive effects. The present data also suggest activating the L-arginine–NO–cGMP-KATP channel pathway as well as interaction of opioid, PPA, and cannabinoid receptors in the BFEO anti-nociceptive activities. These results also propose that BFEO could effectively attenuate allodynia in CSC mice.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBupleurum falcatum 3aanalgesic effect 3aanalgesics 3aarginine 3acannabinoids 3aessential oils 3aglibenclamide 3aintraperitoneal injection 3amales 3amethylene blue 3amodels 3apain 3aspinal cord 3atraditional medicine 3atransient receptor potential vanilloid channels 0aBupleurum falcatum 0aL-arginine/Nitric oxide/cyclic GMP/K-ATP 0aPeripheral antinociception 0aNaltrindole 0aPubChem CID: 5497186 0aNor-binaltorphimine 0aPubChem CID: 5480230 0aNaloxonazine 0aPubChem CID: 9576413 0aMethylene blue 0aPubChem CID: 6099 0aGlibenclamide 0aPubChem CID: 3488 0aL-arginine 0aPubChem CID: 6322 0aNitroprusside sodium 0aPubChem CID: 11953895 0aSaikosaponin A 0aPubChem CID: 167928 0aMorphine 0aPubChem CID: 5288826 0aNaloxone 0aPubChem CID: 5464092 0aDiazepam 0aPubChem CID: 6452650 0aNω-nitro-L-arginine methyl Ester hydrochloride 0aPubChem CID: 39836 0aGW6471 0aPubChem CID: 446738 0aGW9662 0aPubChem CID: 644213 0aSR141716A 0aPubChem CID: 104849 0aCapsazepine 0aPubChem CID: 2733484 0aYohimbine 0aPubChem CID: 89691 aZarei, Mohammad1 aMohammadi, Saeed1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6966-74931 aIzadidastenaei, Zohreh1 aSalehi, Iraj0 tJournal of ethnopharmacology.g2021 June 12, v. 273 p.113990-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl30651x0378-87417nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jep.2021.1139903Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02115naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003100113040001800144100002200162245005700184300001600241520079100257592002801048650002701076650001501103650001101118650001601129650002001145650001901165650001101184650002201195650001801217650002601235650001201261650001601273650002001289650002201309650002201331650003201353650001601385650002601401651001201427651001201439773010801451856007701559852000901636655001201645IND50073005920221117233426.0160903e200009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007300592DNAL7 a117932322pmid7 a10.1007/s1014200000162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKeilbart, Martina10aSocial responsibility in human genetics – a survey  ap. 150-151.  aThe potential for molecular biological manipulation of human beings is a challenge to the social responsibility of human geneticists.

The results reveal differences in the understanding of health and these perceptions are shown to depend on the age and gender of the professionals involved.  aPublisher supplied data 3aattitudes and opinions 3abiologists 3agender 3ageneticists 3ahealth services 3ahuman genetics 3ahumans 3amolecular biology 3aprofessionals 3asocial responsibility 3asurveys 2aAge Factors 2aData Collection 2aGenetics, Medical 2aMolecular Biology 2aSurveys and Questionnaires. 2aSex Factors 2aSocial Responsibility 3aGermany 0aGermany0 tFunctional & integrative genomics.g2000 Sept., v. 1, no. 2 p.150-151dSpringer-Verlagx1438-793X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s1014200000163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02019naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002400152245010700176300001600283520070600299592002801005650001301033650001701046650002401063650001801087650001901105650002001124650001401144650001701158650001801175650000901193650001201202653001801214653002701232653002401259653001901283653001701302653003401319700002901353773010701382856008701489852000901576655001201585IND60552941520221123003329.0180830e20160920xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055294152DNAL7 a10.1016/j.colsurfa.2016.02.0172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPodgórna, Karolina10aSynthesis of polyelectrolyte nanocapsules with iron oxide (Fe3O4) nanoparticles for magnetic targeting  ap. 132-137.  aMagnetic vehicles have become highly promising for delivery of therapeutic actives as they can be targeted to selected pathologically changed tissues/cells through the application of a magnetic field gradient.

This study was designed to evaluate the influence of solvents and ultrasound-assisted extraction (UAE) parameters including time, temperature, and sonication power on the yield of phenolic compounds and antioxidant capacity from lemon scented tea tree leaves. Extraction efficiency of the optimal UAE conditions were compared with that of shaking water bath technique. The results show that extraction solvents significantly affect extraction yield of phenolic compounds and antioxidant properties, and 50% acetone in water was found to be the most suitable solvent. The UAE optimal conditions were 60 min, 50 °C and sonication power of 200 W. Under these optimal conditions the yields of total phenolics, flavonoids, proanthocyanidins were 98.91 ± 1.20 (mg GAE/g DW), 76.12 ± 0.79 (mg CE/g DW), 117.71 ± 2.18 (mg CE/g DW), respectively. Antioxidant properties from four assays including FRAP, CUPRAC, ABTS and DPPH were 581.29 ± 14.23, 5534.87 ± 19.56, 1636.18 ± 4.11, and 889.29 ± 20.68 (mM TE/g DW) respectively. The UAE extraction technique was found to be more efficient in extraction of total phenolics and antioxidant capacity in comparison with conventional shaking water bath extraction. This study also observed a strong correlation between phenolic compounds and antioxidant capacities. All three phenolic compound groups (TPC, TFC, and Pro.A) were contributed to both free radical scavenging and ion reducing properties in the lemon scented tea tree leaves extract. However, the order of the phenolic groups was TPC > Pro.A > TFC for antioxidant properties.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aLeptospermum 3aacetone 3aantioxidant activity 3aflavonoids 3afree radicals 3alemons 3aproanthocyanidins 3asolvents 3asonication 3atea 3atemperature 3atrees 3aultrasonic treatment 3aultrasonics 0aFood science 0aLemon scented tea tree 0aBioactive compound 0aPhenolic compound 0aFlavonoid 0aProanthocyanidin 0aAntioxidant 0aResponse surface methodology 0aUltrasound assisted extraction 0aExtraction solvent 0aOptimization1 aMcCullum, Rebecca1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5965-82751 aMcCluskey, Adam1 aVuong, Quan0 tHeliyon.g2020 Apr., v. 6, no. 4 p.e03666-dElsevier LtdwJournal:23264x2405-84407nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2020.e036663Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02979naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002000152245008600172300001600258520141000274592002801684650001401712650001501726650000801741650002201749650001301771650001701784650001001801650000701811650002101818650002001839653004701859653002201906653002701928653003201955653003001987653002802017700002202045700002902067700001902096700001802115700002202133700002402155700003602179700002302215700002002238773010702258856008702365852000902452655001202461IND60552941620221123021040.0180830e20160920xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055294162DNAL7 a10.1016/j.colsurfa.2016.02.0182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAricov, Ludmila10aAqueous solutions of associative poly(acrylates): Bulk and interfacial properties  ap. 138-149.  aHydrophobically modified polyelectrolytes, such as polyacrylic acids (PAA) are widely used as technological viscosifiers. At the same time, they are of great academic interest in view of wide possibilities for fine-tuning of their aqueous solution properties. The latter strongly depend on the quantity of added low-molecular-mass electrolytes and are sensitive to the pH-value of the solution. The present study explores the bulk and interfacial characteristics of aqueous solutions of two polyacrylic acids: PAA150C10 (MW=150000) and PAA150C12 (MW=150000), randomly grafted with 3mol% decyl (C10) and dodecyl (C12) chains. Bulk viscoelastic properties of PAA150C10 and PAA150C12 are explored; dynamic, equilibrium and rheological properties of the adsorption layers at solution/air interface are studied, as well. For the same systems, microscopic foam films are investigated (drainage kinetics, disjoining pressure vs. film thickness isotherms, stability, etc.). The obtained results contain valuable new information which may be related to the interplay of the specific interactions in the particular formulations and to the possible conformation changes of these amphiphilic polymers. The experimental data provide additional evidences for the response of the investigated aqueous systems to well-defined changes in the experimental conditions (pH, addition of low-molecular-mass electrolytes, etc.).  aPublisher supplied data 3aacrylates 3aadsorption 3aair 3aaqueous solutions 3adrainage 3aelectrolytes 3afoams 3apH 3apolyacrylic acid 3aviscoelasticity 0aHydrophobically modified polyacrylic acids 0aAdsorption layers 0aMicroscopic foam films 0aSurface dilational rheology 0aElectrostatic interaction 0aHydrophobic interaction1 aPetkova, Hristina1 aArabadzhieva, Dimitrinka1 aIovescu, Alina1 aMileva, Elena1 aKhristov, Khristo1 aStîngă, Gabriela,1 aMihailescu, Cristina-Florentina1 aAnghel, Dan Florin1 aTodorov, Roumen0 tColloids and surfaces.g2016 Sept. 20, v. 505 p.138-149dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11945x0927-77577nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfa.2016.02.0183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02954naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100002100188245014500209300001600354506007600370520166200446592002802108506003702136650002502173650002302198650001402221650001402235650001202249650001102261650001402272650001102286650001102297651001102308700002202319700002102341773009202362856008102454852000902535655001202544IND60520319320221207142705.0160519e201606  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052031932DNAL7 a10.1007/s10453-015-9397-z2doi7 aPMC48719212pmcid7 a273403302pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBogawski, Paweł10aFlowering phenology and potential pollen emission of three Artemisia species in relation to airborne pollen data in Poznań (Western Poland)  ap. 265-276.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aArtemisia pollen is an important allergen in Europe. In Poznań (Western Poland), three Artemisia species, A. vulgaris, A. campestris and A. absinthium, are widely distributed. However, the contributions of these species to the total airborne pollen are unknown. The aim of the study was to determine the flowering phenology and pollen production of the three abovementioned species and to construct a model of potential Artemisia pollen emission in the study area. Phenological observations were conducted in 2012 at six sites in Poznań using a BBCH phenological scale. Pollen production was estimated by counting the pollen grains per flower and recalculating the totals per inflorescence, plant and population in the study area. Airborne pollen concentrations were obtained using a Hirst-type volumetric trap located in the study area. Artemisia vulgaris began to flower the earliest, followed by A. absinthium and then A. campestris. The flowering of A. vulgaris corresponded to the first peak in the airborne pollen level, and the flowering of A. campestris coincided with the second pollen peak. The highest amounts of pollen per single plant were produced by A. vulgaris and A. absinthium. A. campestris produced considerably less pollen, however, due to its common occurrence, it contributed markedly (30 %) to the summation of total of recorded pollen. A. vulgaris is the most important pollen source in Poznań, but the roles of two other Artemisia species cannot be ignored. In particular, A. campestris should be considered as an important pollen contributor and likely might be one of the main causes of allergic reactions during late summer.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aArtemisia absinthium 3aArtemisia vulgaris 3aallergens 3aflowering 3aflowers 3amodels 3aphenology 3apollen 3asummer 3aPoland1 aGrewling, Łukasz1 aFrątczak, Agata0 tAerobiologia.g2016 June, v. 32, no. 2 p.265-276dSpringer Netherlandsx0393-59657nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10453-015-9397-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02883naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001500147245010100162300001800263520146900281592002801750650001601778650001101794650002001805650001701825650002401842650003201866650001001898650000901908650002001917650001001937650001001947650001801957650002101975650001601996650001402012650000902026650002002035650002902055700001402084700001802098700001502116700001302131700001402144700001402158700001702172773008602189856008102275852000902356655001202365IND60439484220221123022658.0151024e201508  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6043948422DNAL7 a10.1007/s10646-015-1510-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSun, Liwei10aTranscriptional Responses in Adult Zebrafish (Danio rerio) Exposed to Propranolol and Metoprolol  ap. 1352-1361.  aβ-adrenergic receptor blockers (β-blockers) are widely detected in the aquatic environment; however, the effects of these pharmaceuticals on aquatic organisms remain uncertain. In this study, adult zebrafish were exposed to two different β-blockers, propranolol and metoprolol, for 96 h. After exposure, the transcriptional responses of genes encoding the β-adrenergic receptor (i.e., adrb1, adrb2a, adrb2b, adrb3a and adrb3b), genes involved in detoxification and the stress response (i.e., hsp70, tap, mt1 and mt2), and genes related to the antioxidant system (i.e., cu/zn-sod, mn-sod, cat and gpx) were examined in the brain, liver and gonad. Our results show that both propranolol and metoprolol exposure changes the mRNA level of β-adrenergic receptors, indicating clear pharmacological target engagement of the β-blockers. The transcription of genes related to antioxidant responses and detoxification process were induced, suggesting that β-blocker exposure can activate the detoxification process and result in oxidative stress in fish. Moreover, the transcriptional responses displayed substantial tissue- and gender-specific effects. Considering the environmental concentrations of propranolol and metoprolol, these results suggest that these pharmaceuticals are unlikely to pose a risk to fish. However, the impacts in prolonged exposure, along with other possible side effects due to β-adrenergic receptor blockade, should be further assessed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDanio rerio 3aadults 3aadverse effects 3aantioxidants 3aaquatic environment 3abeta-adrenergic antagonists 3abrain 3afish 3agene expression 3agenes 3aliver 3amessenger RNA 3aoxidative stress 3apropranolol 3areceptors 3arisk 3astress response 3atranscription (genetics)1 aLiu, Fang1 aChen, Haigang1 aWang, Sisi1 aLin, Xia1 aChi, Jian1 aZhu, Qing1 aFu, Zhengwei0 tEcotoxicology.g2015 Aug., v. 24, no. 6 p.1352-1361dSpringer USx0963-92927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10646-015-1510-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01602naa a2200277 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002000152245010200172300001600274520074500290592002801035650001501063650001301078650001401091650001101105650002501116650001301141773009401154856005501248852000901303655001201312IND4501472620221119091805.0150416e200006  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND450147262DNAL7 a10.1111/j.0006-341X.2000.00571.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGray, Robert J.10aEstimation of Regression Parameters and the Hazard Function in Transformed Linear Survival Models  ap. 571-576.  aAn estimator of the regression parameters in a semiparametric transformed linear survival model is examined. This estimator consists of a single Newtonâlike update of the solution to a rankâbased estimating equation from an initial consistent estimator. An automated penalized likelihood algorithm is proposed for estimating the optimal weight function for the estimating equations and the error hazard function that is needed in the variance estimator. In simulations, the estimated optimal weights are found to give reasonably efficient estimators of the regression parameters, and the variance estimators are found to perform well. The methodology is applied to an analysis of prognostic factors in nonâHodgkin's lymphoma.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3abiometry 3aequations 3amodels 3anon-Hodgkin lymphoma 3avariance0 tBiometrics.g2000 June, v. 56, no. 2 p.571-576dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0006-341X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.0006-341X.2000.00571.x  aDNAL 7aarticle02442naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002500152245012500177300001400302520092100316592002801237650002201265650001501287650001301302650001101315650001501326650001101341650004401352650001501396650001501411650002001426653000801446653000801454653000801462653001301470653000901483653001001492653000801502653000801510653000801518653001001526653000701536653002801543653001801571653001701589653001801606700002601624700002101650700001801671773010301689856008701792852000901879655001201888IND60552941920221123003434.0180830e20160520xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055294192DNAL7 a10.1016/j.colsurfa.2016.02.0212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBernardo, Marcela P.10aPhysico-chemical assessment of [Mg-Al-PO4]-LDHs obtained by structural reconstruction in high concentration of phosphate  ap. 53-62.  aWe report that hydrotalcite-like LDHs ([Mg-Al]-LDHs) can act as host matrixes for controlled release of phosphate. The memory effect was successfully employed to incorporate high loadings of PO4³⁻ into [Mg-Al]-LDHs. The intercalation of PO4³⁻ anions was confirmed to occur by XRD measurements at a 1:2.5 Al³⁺:PO4³⁻ molar ratio. We uncover a strong concentration dependence of PO4³⁻ adsorption process in reconstructed LDHs in which intercalation and precipitation happen as coexisting steps. This was confirmed by ²⁷Al and ³¹P solid state NMR. Regardless of the adsorption mechanism, the PO4³⁻ release from [Mg-Al]-LDHs was successfully confirmed. The Higuchi model provided the best fit for the release profile, with R²=0.92. All [Mg-Al]-LDHs returned to a pure LDH phase composition after PO4³⁻ desorption, thereby exhibiting a recycling capacity for slow phosphate release applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3aadsorption 3aaluminum 3aanions 3adesorption 3amodels 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aphosphates 3aphosphorus 3astable isotopes 0aLDH 0aDNA 0aRNA 0a[Mg-Al]c 0aPXRD 0aFT-IR 0aBET 0aSEM 0aNMR 0aJCPDS 0aCD 0aSlow release fertilizer 0aMemory effect 0aSurface area 0aPrecipitation1 aMoreira, Francys K.V.1 aColnago, Luiz A.1 aRibeiro, Caue0 tColloids and surfaces.g2016 May 20, v. 497 p.53-62dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11945x0927-77577nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfa.2016.02.0213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle05465naa a2201777 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001200150245007800162520188400240592002802124650001402152650002102166650003702187650001402224651001002238653002002248653001502268653001202283653001502295653001102310653001102321653000902332653001302341653000802354653000902362653001002371653001002381653000802391653000902399653000802408653000902416653000802425653000702433653000902440653000802449653001002457653000702467653000702474653001102481653000902492653001002501653000902511653000702520653000802527653000802535653000802543653000802551653000902559653001102568653001002579653000802589653001202597653000902609653001002618653001002628653000802638653000902646653001002655653000702665653000802672653001002680653001002690653001002700653000802710653000802718653000902726653001002735653000702745653001102752653001002763653000902773653000902782653001302791653001002804653001002814653000902824653001002833653001302843653000802856653001302864653000802877653001002885653000902895653000902904653001002913653000902923653001002932653000902942653001002951653000902961653001002970653000902980653000902989653000802998653000903006653000803015653000803023653000803031653000903039653000803048653000903056653000803065653000903073653000903082653001203091653001003103653000903113653000803122653000803130653000703138653000803145653000903153653000703162653000903169653000903178653000803187653000803195653001003203653001103213653000803224653001003232653001003242653001003252653001303262653000803275653000903283653001103292653000903303653000803312653001203320653001003332653001003342653000903352653001003361653000803371653001003379700001803389700001403407700001803421700001803439700001403457700001603471773009403487856008503581852000903666655001203675IND60753793520221116162204.0211123e202112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075379352DNAL7 a10.1016/j.phymed.2021.1537992doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAn, Pei10aNatural products are an important source for proteasome regulating agents  aNatural medicines have a long history in the prevention and treatment of various diseases in East Asian region, especially in China. Modern research has proved that the pharmacological effects of numerous natural medicines involve the participation of ubiquitin proteasome system (UPS). UPS can degrade the unwanted and damaged proteins widely distributed in the nucleus and cytoplasm of various eukaryotes.The objective of the present study was to review and discuss the regulatory effects of natural products and extracts on proteasome components, which may help to find new proteasome regulators for drug development and clinical applications.The related information was compiled using the major scientific databases, such as CNKI, Elsevier, ScienceDirect, PubMed, SpringerLink, Wiley Online, and GeenMedical. The keywords “natural product” and “proteasome” were applied to extract the literature. Nature derived extracts, compounds and their derivatives involved in proteasome regulation were included, and the publications related to synthetic proteasome agents were excluded.The pharmacological effects of more than 80 natural products and extracts derived from phytomedicines related to the proteasome regulation were reviewed. These natural products were classified according to their chemical properties. We also summarized some laws of action of natural products as proteasome regulators in the treatment of diseases, and listed the action characteristics of the typical natural products.Natural products derived from nature can induce the degradation of damaged proteins through UPS or act as regulators to directly regulate the activity of proteasome. But few proteasome modulators are applied clinically. Summary of known rules for proteasome modulators will contribute to discover, modify and synthesize more proteasome modulators for clinical applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3acytoplasm 3adrug development 3aproteasome endopeptidase complex 3aubiquitin 3aChina 0aNatural product 0aProteasome 0aProtein 0aRegulation 0aα-MSH 0aα-Syn 0aAP-1 0a18 α-GA 0aAAR 0aAAVP 0aABCG1 0aABCG2 0aALS 0aAMFR 0aAML 0aAMPK 0aAPI 0aAR 0aATF3 0aATG 0aBcl-2 0aBD 0aBF 0aCDC25C 0aCDKs 0aCFLIP 0aCHOP 0aCP 0aCRL 0aCSE 0aCSL 0aCur 0aCx43 0aCys151 0aDAPK1 0aDHA 0aDKC-E70 0aDUBs 0aDYRK1 0aEBNA1 0aEBV 0aEGCG 0aEGL-1 0aER 0aERK 0aERRα 0aER-β 0aFBXO7 0aGBM 0aGCS 0aGSCs 0aGSK-3 0aHD 0aHDAC-6 0aHDACs 0aHER2 0aHGPS 0aHIF-1 α 0aHMGB1 0aHMOX1 0aHO-1 0aHsp70 0aIFN-αR1 0aIKB 0aJAK/STAT 0aJNK 0aKeap1 0aLKB1 0aLMP2 0aMCL-1 0aMITF 0aMMP 9 0amTOR 0anAchR 0aNCTD 0aNF-KB 0aNFYA 0aNOX4 0aNPC 0aNrf2 0aNTS 0aOGD 0aOMT 0aPARP 0aPCG 0aPHD1 0aPKA 0aPP2A 0aPRMT 0aPROTACs 0aPSMA5 0aPTEN 0aPTX 0aROS 0aRP 0aRSV 0aRTHF 0aSB 0aSCA3 0aSCID 0aSFN 0aSIN 0aSIRT1 0aSMURF2 0aSP1 0aSP-A2 0aSPHK1 0aSRC-1 0aTan-ⅡA 0aTFs 0aTGFR 0aTGF-β 0aTLR2 0aTMZ 0aTNF- α 0aTOPOI 0aTRAIL 0aTTC3 0aUbcH8 0aUPS 0aVEGFR1 aZhang, Li-Jun1 aPeng, Wei1 aChen, Yu-Ying1 aLiu, Qiu-Ping1 aLuan, Xin1 aZhang, Hong0 tPhytomedicine.g2021 Dec., v. 93 p.153799-dElsevier GmbHwJournal:12402x0944-71137nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.phymed.2021.1537993Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03039naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024003900135040001800174100001700192245011200209500001900321506007600340520146100416592002801877506003701905650001501942650002201957650001101979650001201990650001102002653001702013653002202030653002202052653002702074653003102101653001702132653001702149653001702166653001902183653002702202700005402229700006502283700002102348773009302369856008602462852000902548655001202557IND60692660120221207123246.0201024e202004  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069266012DNAL7 a323826682pmid7 aPMC72030722pmcid7 a10.1016/j.heliyon.2020.e036712doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhan, Zhaoxi10aRetrofitting ancient timber glulam mortise & tenon construction joints through computer-aided laser cutting  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThis study is aimed to rationalise and demonstrate the efficacy of utilising laser cutting technique in the fabrication of glulam mortise & tenon joints in timber frame. Trial-and-error experiments aided by laser cutter were conducted to produce 3D timber mortise & tenon joints models. The two main instruments used were 3D modelling software and the laser cutter TH 1390/6090. Plywood was chosen because it could produce smooth and accurate cut edges whereby the surface could remain crack-free, and it could increase stability due to its laminated nature. Google SketchUp was used for modelling and Laser CAD v7.52 was used to transfer the 3D models to the laser cutter because it is compatible with AI, BMP, PLT, DXF and DST templates. Four models were designed and fabricated in which the trial-and-error experiments proved laser cutting could speed up the manufacturing process with superb quality and high uniformity. Precision laser cutting supports easy automation, produces small heat-affected zone, minimises deformity, relatively quiet and produces low amount of waste. The LaserCAD could not process 3D images directly but needed 2D images to be transferred, so layering and unfolding works were therefore needed. This study revealed a significant potential of rapid manufacturability of mortise & tenon joints with high-quality and high-uniformity through computer-aided laser cutting technique for wide applications in the built environment.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aautomation 3acomputer software 3aglulam 3aplywood 3awastes 0aArchitecture 0aCivil engineering 0aMaterials science 0aStructural engineering 0aComputer-aided engineering 0aTenon joints 0aTimber frame 0aLaser cutter 0aMortise joints 0aMortise & tenon joints1 aWang, Chen1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7892-35751 aYap, Jeffrey Boon Hui1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4332-00311 aLoi, Ming Shyang0 tHeliyon.g2020 Apr., v. 6, no. 4 p.e03671-dElsevier LtdwJournal:23264x2405-84407nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2020.e036713Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03482naa a2200661 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002500150245008600175300001600261500001500277520163800292592002801930650000901958650001201967650001401979650001801993650002502011650001002036650001302046650001802059650001102077650003102088650002202119650002302141650001102164650000902175650002002184650001402204650001502218650002602233650002302259650002202282650001902304650001102323650001502334650003002349650000902379650000902388650000902397650001002406650001202416650002502428651001602453653001602469653002402485653003002509700001802539700002002557700001702577773012002594856008502714852000902799655001202808IND50071007920221118041450.0190401e20140117xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007100792DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vetpar.2013.09.0232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBasso, V.q(Valter),10aGeneralized Taenia crassiceps cysticercosis in a chinchilla (Chinchilla lanigera)  ap. 116-120.  a2019-12-06  aTaenia crassiceps is a cestode parasite that uses carnivores as definitive hosts and rodents and rabbits as main intermediate hosts, but other animal species and humans may also get infected. One adult male chinchilla (Chinchilla lanigera) from an animal shelter in Switzerland presented widespread subcutaneous fluctuant swellings extended over the forehead, nose, face and thoracic regions with a progressive growth over 3 months. The thoracic swelling was surgically resected, and it consisted of numerous 3–4mm small transparent vesicles, mainly confined to the subcutaneous tissue, which were morphologically identified as cysticerci of T. crassiceps. The diagnosis was confirmed by PCR and DNA sequence analysis of fragments of the mitochondrial small subunit rRNA and NADH dehydrogenase subunit 1 genes. After 1.5 months, due to enlargement of the swollen areas and deterioration of the general health condition, the chinchilla was euthanized and a necropsy was performed. Thousands of small cysticerci were observed widespread in the subcutis, involving underlying musculature of the whole body, in the thoracic cavity, larynx, pharynx and in the retropharyngeal region. Additionally, three larger metacestodes were detected in the liver and morphologically and molecularly identified as Taenia taeniaeformis strobilocerci. The present case represents an indicator of the environmental contamination with Taenia eggs, highlighting the risk of infection for susceptible animals and humans. Besides the clinical relevance for pets, T. crassiceps is a zoonotic parasite and can be also cause of severe cysticercosis in humans.  aPublisher supplied data 3anose 3arabbits 3aparasites 3aribosomal RNA 3aTaenia taeniaeformis 3agenes 3anecropsy 3acysticercosis 3alarynx 3aChinchilla (Chinchillidae) 3aTaenia crassiceps 3aNADH dehydrogenase 3aadults 3arisk 3athoracic cavity 3apollution 3acarnivores 3abiological resistance 3aintermediate hosts 3asequence analysis 3aNAD (coenzyme) 3ahumans 3acysticerci 3apolymerase chain reaction 3apets 3aface 3aeggs 3aliver 3apharynx 3anucleotide sequences 3aSwitzerland 0achinchillas 0aChinchilla lanigera 0aGeneralized cysticercosis1 aRütten, Maja1 aDeplazes, Peter1 aGrimm, Felix0 tVeterinary parasitology.g2014 Jan. 17, v. 199, no. 1-2 p.116-120dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl11815x0304-40177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vetpar.2013.09.0233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02568naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100003000147245005200177300001600229520121900245592002801464650001801492650001501510650001601525650001201541650001101553650001501564650001601579650001101595650002201606650001901628650002001647650001101667650001601678650001601694650001501710700002601725700002201751700001601773700003301789700002601822700002601848700003001874773009201904856008101996852000902077655001202086IND60520319720221118153622.0160519e201606  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052031972DNAL7 a10.1007/s10453-015-9401-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMoreno-Sarmiento, Maribel10aUrban airborne pollen in a semiarid environment  ap. 363-370.  aThe present investigation was conducted to determine the pollen types and their quantities in the atmosphere of Obregón City (a semiarid region) and establish the relationship with meteorological parameters in 2008 and 2011. A bimodal pattern with peaks in dry warm (spring) and late rainy (autumn) seasons was observed. The highest monthly pollen indexes were observed in October 2008 and September 2011. Precipitation in 2008 was 2.6 times higher than in 2011, beginning in June in both years, and ending in November (2008) and September (2011). Main pollen types were Poaceae, Chenopodiaceae/Amaranthaceae, Asteraceae and Parkinsonia (the latter was dominant in the dry warm season). Statistical correlations (Spearman’s rank-order correlation p < 0.05) with meteorological parameters were performed. In both sampling years, relative humidity caused adverse effects on the atmospheric pollen content, while temperature, solar radiation and wind speed in the dry season were associated with increased pollen indexes. Compared to other studies of semiarid areas, the pollen index at Obregón is low, which is attributed to a relatively high humidity and to the large area of grain crops surrounding the city.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAmaranthaceae 3aAsteraceae 3aParkinsonia 3aPoaceae 3aautumn 3adry season 3agrain crops 3apollen 3arelative humidity 3asemiarid zones 3asolar radiation 3aspring 3atemperature 3awarm season 3awind speed1 aPeñalba, M.

Chikusetsusaponin Ⅳa (CS-IVa), an active compound in Panax japonicus C.A. Mey, has a good anti-inflammatory effect, but whether this compound can serve as a targeted drug for RA and the corresponding therapeutic mechanism remain unclear.To investigate the anti-inflammatory and bone-protecting effects of CS-IVa on RA and the possible corresponding mechanisms of action.Biomarkers and underlying pathological mechanisms were examined by performing a bioinformatics analysis of RA synovial gene expression data profiles, and the feasibility of CS-IVa treatment for RA was predicted using molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulation techniques. Histomorphological and molecular biology techniques were used to verify the feasibility and molecular mechanism of CS-IVa treatment for RA in vivo using a collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) model.CS-IVa alleviated symptoms and reduced the immune organ index, arthritis index, hind paw thickness, and number of swollen joints in the foot for CIA mice. Bioinformatics analysis suggested that interferon-gamma (IFN-γ), interleukin-1 β (IL-1β), and the Janus kinase/signal transduction and activator of transcription (JAK/STAT) pathway played important roles in the pathogenesis of RA. The results of molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulations showed that CS-IVa bound effectively to IFN-γ and IL-1β and that the combined pose has good stability and flexibility. The histomorphological results showed that CS-IVa reduced joint histopathology scores, OARSI scores, and TRAP-positive cell counts. Molecular biology analysis indicated that CS-IVa reduced the concentration of inflammatory factors in the peripheral serum of CIA mice and suppressed the mRNA expression of these factors in the spleen in a dose-dependent manner. The protein expression level of the JAK/STAT pathway was also inhibited by CS-IVa.The results of the current study demonstrate a novel inhibitory effect of CS-IVa on inflammation and bone destruction in CIA mice, and the mechanism may be related to the JAK/STAT signaling pathway, which provides new insights into the development of CS-IVa as a therapeutic agent for RA.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPanax japonicus 3aactive ingredients 3aanti-inflammatory activity 3abioinformatics 3ablood serum 3adose response 3adrug therapy 3adrugs 3agene expression 3ahistopathology 3ainflammation 3ainterferon-gamma 3amolecular biology 3amolecular dynamics 3anon-specific protein-tyrosine kinase 3apathogenesis 3aprotein synthesis 3arheumatoid arthritis 3asignal transduction 3aspleen 3atransactivators 0aChikusetsusaponin Ⅳa 0aJAK-STAT signaling pathways 0aBone destruction 0aAI 0aACPA 0aCIA 0aCS-Iva 0aDMARD 0aDEG 0aIL 0aIFN 0aIOD 0aJAK/STAT 0aKEGG 0aOARSI 0aPPI 0aRA 0aTRAP 0aTNF 0aWGCNA1 aJi, Jinyu1 aZhang, Jingkai1 aHou, Xiaoqiang1 aFu, Xianyun1 aLuo, Yanan1 aMei, Zhigang1 aFeng, Zhitao0 tPhytomedicine.g2021 Dec., v. 93 p.153801-dElsevier GmbHwJournal:12402x0944-71137nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.phymed.2021.1538013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02805naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001300148245016000161300001600321520130400337592002801641650001501669650001101684650002001695650002101715650001501736650001501751650002201766650001101788650001301799650001801812650001401830650002101844650001401865650001501879650001701894653001201911653001401923653002301937653001101960653000901971700001801980700001901998700001702017700001802034700001802052700001802070773009602088856008202184852000902266655001202275IND60553342020221119150404.0170607e20140315xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055334202DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bios.2013.10.0152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHu, Rong10aNovel electrochemical aptamer biosensor based on an enzyme–gold nanoparticle dual label for the ultrasensitive detection of epithelial tumour marker MUC1  ap. 384-389.  aA novel platform based on a hairpin oligonucleotide (HO) switch, gold nanoparticles (AuNPs), and enzyme signal amplification for the ultrasensitive detection of mucin 1 protein (MUC1) was developed in this assay. This HO aptamers and horseradish peroxidase (HRP) were immobilised on the AuNPs to yield HO–AuNP–HRP conjugates. AuNPs were used as labels and bridges between the HO and HRP. HRP was also used as label for catalysing the oxidation of o-phenylenediamine by H2O2. The reaction product was 2,3-diaminophenazine (DAP), which was reduced and could be detected at surface of modified electrode. The reduction signal of DAP was used as a probe for the sensitive detection. After the recognition between oligonucleotide and MUC1, biotin was exposed. Biotin, along with the conjugate, was captured by streptavidin onto the surface of modified electrode. Therefore, the detection of target MUC1 which was a membrane-associated glycoprotein of the mucin family could be sensitively transduced via detection of the electrochemical reduction signal of DAP. Compared to other aptasensors, this biosensor has a good linear correlation ranges from 8.8nM to 353.3nM and a lower detection limit of 2.2nM for MUC1. The proposed method provided a new electrochemical approach for the detection of MUC1.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiosensors 3abiotin 3adetection limit 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrodes 3aepithelium 3ahydrogen peroxide 3amucins 3ananogold 3ananoparticles 3aneoplasms 3aoligonucleotides 3aoxidation 3aperoxidase 3astreptavidin 0aAptamer 0aBiosensor 0aGold nanoparticles 0aEnzyme 0aMUC11 aWang, Wenwei,1 aWang, Qingling1 aXiong, Huayu1 aZhang, Xiuhua1 aGu, Haoshuang1 aWang, Shengfu0 tBiosensors & bioelectronics.g2014 Mar. 15, v. 53 p.384-389dElsevier B.V.x0956-56637nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bios.2013.10.0153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03198naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002000148245014500168300001600313520174500329592002802074596009702102650001502199650002602214650001102240650001402251650002202265650001802287650001402305650001602319650001602335650001502351650001602366650002002382650001302402650002602415700002402441700002102465700005702486773012902543856008302672852000902755655001202764IND60768079420221121224233.0220726e202203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076807942DNAL7 a10.1007/s10340-021-01399-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChabaane, Yosra10aAltered capsaicin levels in domesticated chili pepper varieties affect the interaction between a generalist herbivore and its ectoparasitoid  ap. 735-747.  aPlant domestication has commonly reduced levels of secondary metabolites known to confer resistance against insects. Chili pepper is a special case because the fruits of different varieties have been selected for lower and higher levels of capsaicin, the main compound associated with defence. This may have important consequences for insect herbivores and their natural enemies. Despite the widespread consumption of chili peppers worldwide, the effects of capsaicin on insects are poorly understood. Here, we investigated the effect of capsaicin on a generalist herbivore, Spodoptera latifascia (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) and its ectoparasitoid, Euplectrus platyhypenae (Hymenoptera: Eulophidae). Using chili varieties with three pungency levels: non-pungent (Padron), mild (Cayenne) and highly pungent (Habanero), as well as artificial diets spiked with three different levels of synthetic capsaicin, we determined whether higher capsaicin levels negatively affect the performance of these insects. Overall, capsaicin had a negative effect on both herbivore and parasitoid performance, particularly at high concentrations. Caterpillars reared on highly pungent fruits and high-capsaicin diet had longer development time, reduced pupation success, lower adult emergence, but also lower parasitism rates than caterpillars reared on mild or non-capsaicin treatments. In addition, we found that the caterpillars were capable of sequestering capsaicinoids in their haemolymph when fed on the high pungent variety with consequences for parasitoids’ performance and oviposition decisions. These results increase our understanding of the role of capsaicin as a chemical defence against insects and its potential implications for pest management.  aPublisher supplied data  a31003A-162860cSchweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Förderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung 3aEuplectrus 3aSpodoptera latifascia 3aadults 3acapsaicin 3achemical defenses 3adomestication 3ahemolymph 3ahot peppers 3aoviposition 3aparasitism 3aparasitoids 3apest management 3apupation 3asecondary metabolites1 aMarques Arce, Carla1 aGlauser, Gaëtan1 aBenrey, Betty1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3230-44500 tJournal of pest science.g2022 Mar., v. 95, no. 2 p.735-747dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl3870064x1612-47587nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10340-021-01399-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03568naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245008800166520209300254592002802347650002602375650002102401650001702422650002902439650001102468650002302479650001302502650001702515650000902532650002302541650001402564650001902578650001702597650000902614650002502623651001002648653003102658653001802689653001702707653001602724700005702740700001302797700001502810700001602825700001402841773011602855856008202971852000903053655001203062IND60730734020221120051929.0220606e20210612xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073073402DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jep.2021.1139982doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSun, Xiangting10aEvaluation of the wound healing potential of Sophora alopecuroides in SD rat's skin  aSophora alopecuroides Linn. (Leguminosae) has been largely used in traditional folk medicine in China as an anti-inflammatory agent and to treat various skin wounds, including sore furunculosis and ulcer (a common type of non-healing wound). The present study aimed to evaluate the effects of S. alopecuroides gel on skin wound healing in rats. When the rats were anesthetized, full-thickness skin wound was performed on dorsal area by using biopsy punch with 8 mm diameter. Then, wounds received treatment with different doses of S. alopecuroides gel (1.25%, 2.5% and 5%, w/w) once a day with the gel base used as vehicle control and rb-FGF as positive control. Every five animals were sacrificed after 7, 12 days after surgery for histopathology and relevant biochemical indexes analysis. Besides, after RAW 264.7 cells exposure to LPS (1 μg/ml) with or without total extract (25 and 50 μg/ml) for 24 h, the culture supernatant was used for detection of IL-1β and TNF-α levels using ELISA kits and the protein lysate for western blot analysis. A remarkable wound closure was observed after administration with 5% S. alopecuroides gel with the wound area of 30% and 8.5% as compared to 42% and 19% in the control group on day 7 and 12, respectively. Histological and immunostaining analysis for the wound tissues also revealed that S. alopecuroides promoted the growth of granulation tissue, collagen deposition, cell proliferation and angiogenesis. Meanwhile, it was able to ameliorate inflammatory response and promote the production of TGF-β. In addition, we also demonstrated that S. alopecuroides inhibited the release of inflammatory mediators and expression of iNOS as well as up-regulated the expression of Arg-1 in LPS-triggered RAW 264.7 cells. The present study confirmed that S. alopecuroides had a great potential for accelerated wound healing by regulating the over expression of inflammatory response for the first time and provided theoretical basis for the traditional use. It can be used as candidate drug for the treantment of chronic non-healing wounds.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSophora alopecuroides 3aWestern blotting 3aangiogenesis 3aanti-inflammatory agents 3abiopsy 3acell proliferation 3acollagen 3afurunculosis 3agels 3agranulation tissue 3ahistology 3ahistopathology 3ainflammation 3arats 3atraditional medicine 3aChina 0aSophora alopecuroides Linn 0aWound healing 0aInflammation 0aMacrophages1 aYang, Yanling1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1640-66251 aLiu, Tao1 aHuang, Hao1 aKuang, Ying1 aChen, Lei0 tJournal of ethnopharmacology.g2021 June 12, v. 273 p.113998-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl30651x0378-87417nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jep.2021.1139983Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02409naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024003900135040001800174100001700192245010800209500001900317506007600336520098400412592002801396506003701424650002301461650001301484650001701497650001201514650001501526650001101541653002401552653002201576653001801598653001301616653002101629700002601650700002001676700001901696700006001715773009301775856008601868852000901954655001201963IND60692660320221207123252.0201024e202004  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069266032DNAL7 a322928282pmid7 aPMC71505142pmcid7 a10.1016/j.heliyon.2020.e036742doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPaul, Saurav10aSelf-assembly of silver nanoparticles through functionalization with coumarin-thiazole fused-ring thiol  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aSelf-assembly of nanoscale building blocks plays a critical role for the edifice of functional nanomaterials. In this work coumarin based fused-ring heterocyclic thiol functionalized silver nanoparticle exhibiting large self-assembly is reported. The particles spontaneously self-organise towards the formation of larger superstructures, yet still retaining their individual particle morphology (~10nm). The π-stacking behaviour of coumarin based fused ring aromatic skeleton seems to play the key role for the induction of dense assembly in this hybrid nanoparticles. In the present work the anchoring group (thiol) is directly attached to the aromatic framework of the Coumarin-thiazole fused-ring, for easier electron flow between the metal and the aromatic ligand. The synthesized materials have been characterized by UV-Vis, Fluorescence, XRD, TEM, SAED, IR, ¹H and ¹³C NMR. The synthesis of the ligand and process of functionalization is simple and easily reproducible.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aaromatic compounds 3acoumarin 3afluorescence 3aligands 3ananosilver 3athiols 0aMaterials chemistry 0aOrganic chemistry 0aSelf-assembly 0aThiazole 0aFused-ring thiol1 aChakraborty, Bimal B.1 aAnwar, Siddique1 aPaul, Satya B.1 aChoudhury, Sudip1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8592-420X0 tHeliyon.g2020 Apr., v. 6, no. 4 p.e03674-dElsevier LtdwJournal:23264x2405-84407nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2020.e036743Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03279naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100003100139245011000170300001800280500002000298520106600318592002801384596009101412596009101503596009101594596008901685596008801774596002401862650001901886650001801905650001201923650001801935650001801953650001801971650001301989650002102002650002202023650001602045650001902061650002002080700002402100700001702124700002602141700002602167700002302193700003602216700001902252700002002271700002202291700001902313700006102332700002302393700006302416773011602479856007302595852000902668655001202677IND60666295720221121063542.0190917e201909  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066629572DNAL7 a10.1111/tpj.144162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTéllez‐Robledo, Barbara14aThe polyadenylation factor FIP1 is important for plant development and root responses to abiotic stresses  ap. 1203-1219.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aRoot development and its response to environmental changes is crucial for whole plant adaptation. These responses include changes in transcript levels. Here, we show that the alternative polyadenylation (APA) of mRNA is important for root development and responses. Mutations in FIP1, a component of polyadenylation machinery, affects plant development, cell division and elongation, and response to different abiotic stresses. Salt treatment increases the amount of poly(A) site usage within the coding region and 5′ untranslated regions (5′‐UTRs), and the lack of FIP1 activity reduces the poly(A) site usage within these non‐canonical sites. Gene ontology analyses of transcripts displaying APA in response to salt show an enrichment in ABA signaling, and in the response to stresses such as salt or cadmium (Cd), among others. Root growth assays show that fip1‐2 is more tolerant to salt but is hypersensitive to ABA or Cd. Our data indicate that FIP1‐mediated alternative polyadenylation is important for plant development and stress responses.  aPublisher supplied data  aBES‐2012‐054056cSecretaría de Estado de Investigación, Desarrollo e Innovación  aBIO2014‐52091‐RcSecretaría de Estado de Investigación, Desarrollo e Innovación  aBIO2017‐82209‐RcSecretaría de Estado de Investigación, Desarrollo e Innovación  aPTQ‐ 15‐07915cSecretaría de Estado de Investigación, Desarrollo e Innovación  aSEV‐2016‐067cSecretaría de Estado de Investigación, Desarrollo e Innovación  cEuropean Commission 3aabiotic stress 3aabscisic acid 3acadmium 3acell division 3agene ontology 3amessenger RNA 3amutation 3aplant adaptation 3aplant development 3aroot growth 3asalt tolerance 3astress response1 aManzano, Concepcion1 aSaez, Angela1 aNavarro‐Neila, Sara1 aSilva‐Navas, Javier1 aDe Lorenzo, Laura,1 aGonzález‐García, Mary‐Paz1 aToribio, René1 aHunt, Arthur G.1 aBaigorri, Roberto1 aCasimiro, Ilda1 aBrady, Siobhan M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9424-80551 aCastellano, M.

UHPLC with an online ABTS system was used to identify and quantify individual polyphenols present in the rice extract whilst simultaneously measuring their respective antioxidant activity. In addition, the synergistic antioxidant activity of the rice extracts was assessed using the ferric reducing ability of plasma assay (FRAP). The study found that the pigmented rice varieties had higher total antioxidant activity than the brown non-pigmented rice varieties. The red variety Yunlu29 had the highest FRAP total antioxidant activity (303.8 ± 16.16 mg 100 g−1 Trolox equivalents). UHPLC profile of Yunlu29 revealed a wide variety of active polyphenols. In particular, the chromatogram from the red rice variety Yunlu29, contained two unidentified peaks that exhibited the highest antioxidant activity. In the purple rice extract, cyanidin-3-glucoside and peonidin-3-glucoside were profiled as having the most free-radical scavenging activity. In comparison, the brown non-pigmented rice extracts did not exhibit substantial antioxidant activity in its polyphenol UHPLC profile. The results of this study demonstrate the antioxidant potential of polyphenols present in Australian-grown pigmented and non-pigmented rice varieties which may have a future role as a potential functional food ingredient.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantioxidant activity 3afunctional foods 3aingredients 3apolyphenols 3ared rice 3aultra-performance liquid chromatography 0aAnthocyanin 0aPhenolic acid 0aUHPLC-Online ABTS 0aPigmented rice 0aProanthocyanidins 0a2,2′-Azino-bis (3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) 0a2,4,6-Tris(2-pyridyl)-s-triazine 0aCatechin equivalents 0aCyanidin-3-Glucoside 0aFerric reducing ability of plasma assay 0aGallic acid equivalents 0aOne-way analysis of variance 0aPeonidin-3-Glucoside 0aReactive oxygen species 0aTotal anthocyanin content 0aTotal phenolic content 0aTotal proanthocyanidin content 0aTrolox equivalents 0aUltra-high performance liquid chromatography1 aCallcott, Esther T.1 aSanthakumar, Abishek B.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1836-50351 aChinkwo, Kenneth A.1 aVanniasinkam, Thiru1 aLuo, Jixun1 aBlanchard, Christopher L.0 tJournal of cereal science.g2018 Mar., v. 80 p.174-179dElsevier LtdaElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46803x0733-52107nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcs.2018.02.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04292naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002500150245010100175300001400276520271100290592002803001650002903029650001503058650001303073650001003086650001003096650001003106650003803116650001603154650001303170650001103183650001003194650002003204650002103224650002103245650002103266650001603287650001503303650001103318650001403329650001403343653001803357653000803375653001903383653001503402653001103417653002103428700002103449700002103470700002303491773011803514856008503632852000903717655001203726IND50071008220221118041525.0190401e20140117xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007100822DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vetpar.2013.10.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPittaway, Charles E.10aSystemic and mucosal IgE antibody responses of horses to infection with Anoplocephala perfoliata  ap. 32-41.  aInfection of horses with Anoplocephala perfoliata induces a severe inflammatory reaction of the caecal mucosa around the site of parasite attachment adjacent to the ileocecal valve. Lesions show epithelial erosion or ulceration of the mucosa with infiltration by eosinophils, lymphocytes and mast cells leading to oedema, gross thickening and fibrosis of the caecal wall. Despite this evidence of an inflammatory reaction to A. perfoliata within the mucosa of the caecum there is little information about the nature of the local immune response to A. perfoliata. An ELISA which assays serum IgG(T) antibodies to A. perfoliata excretory/secretory antigens has been developed as a diagnostic test. However, the specificity of the ELISA remains sub-optimal and the role of other isotypes in the immune response to A. perfoliata has not been reported. This study measured IgA, IgE and IgG(T) antibody responses to A. perfoliata excretory/secretory antigens in sera of 75 horses presented for slaughter. The prevalence of A. perfoliata infection, as confirmed by the presence of parasites in the terminal ileum, caecum or proximal colon, was 55%. A. perfoliata-specific IgG(T) and IgE antibodies were significantly elevated in infected horses compared to controls; IgA antibodies were also detected but did not differ between infected and control horses. Diagnosis by serum IgG(T) ELISA had a sensitivity of 78% and a specificity of 80%, by comparison the serum IgE ELISA had a sensitivity of just 44% with a specificity of 82% and therefore did not provide an improved diagnostic test. Western blots with sera from infected horses demonstrated IgE-binding to at least 10 separate components of excretory/secretory (E/S) antigens. A similar pattern was also found with IgG(T). Around 30% of horses had high levels of serum IgE which bound fucose-containing carbohydrate antigens on the parasite surface but this was unrelated to the presence of A. perfoliata infection.Immunoperoxidase staining detected numerous IgE-positive cells within lymphoid follicles in the caecal mucosa close to the site of A. perfoliata attachment and quantitative RT-PCR detected high levels of IgE transcription in the caecal mucosa of all horses. Mucosal synthesis of antibodies was confirmed by the demonstration of A. perfoliata-specific IgG(T) and IgE in the supernatant of lamina propria explant cultures that discriminated clearly between infected and uninfected horses. We conclude that there is an active immune response to A. perfoliata within the caecal mucosa involving local production of both IgG(T) and IgE antibody isotypes; but it remains unclear whether this immune response can reduce or eliminate parasite burden.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAnoplocephala perfoliata 3aantibodies 3aantigens 3acecum 3acolon 3aedema 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3aeosinophils 3afibrosis 3ahorses 3aileum 3aimmune response 3aimmunoglobulin A 3aimmunoglobulin E 3aimmunoglobulin G 3alymphocytes 3amast cells 3amucosa 3aparasites 3aslaughter 0aAnoplocephala 0aIgE 0aIgG(T) cestode 0aEosinophil 0aEquine 0aMucosal immunity1 aLawson, April L.1 aColes, Gerald C.1 aDouglas Wilson, A.0 tVeterinary parasitology.g2014 Jan. 17, v. 199, no. 1-2 p.32-41dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl11815x0304-40177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vetpar.2013.10.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02523naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001800152245012800170300001400298520120900312592002801521650001501549650002101564650002101585650003501606650003901641650002101680650002401701650002101725653004501746653001701791653002301808653002201831653001501853700001401868700001901882700001301901773010301914856008702017852000902104655001202113IND60552942420221123031809.0180830e20160520xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055294242DNAL7 a10.1016/j.colsurfa.2016.02.0272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Yanqing10aExperimental and theoretical investigation on the interaction of carboxylic multi-walled carbon nanotubes with bisphenol AF  ap. 45-52.  aThe binding interaction of carboxylic multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs-COOH) with bisphenol AF (BPAF) was investigated using molecular modeling, fluorescence spectroscopy and adsorption experiment. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were also carried out to explain the electronic structure and the electronic transitions of BPAF. It was found that MWCNTs-COOH exhibited strong binding affinity with BPAF, and the adsorption equilibrium was arrived within 5min following the pseudo-second-order model. MWCNTs-COOH is to be a good adsorbing material for BPAF. The hydrophobic interaction, π-π bonding and hydrogen bonds were mainly binding forces for the strong interaction of MWCNTs-COOH with BPAF. In addition, the COOH groups on carbon nanotubes play an important role in adsorption of BPAF. The putative binding modes of BPAF on MWCNTs-COOH included the insert binding mode and the surface binding mode.

Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) M2 (~3.3Ma) is a globally recognisable cooling event that disturbs an otherwise relatively (compared to present-day) warm background climate state. It remains unclear whether this event corresponds to significant ice sheet build-up in the Northern and Southern Hemisphere. Estimates of sea level for this interval vary, and range from modern values to estimates of 65m sea level fall with respect to present day. Here we implement plausible M2 ice sheet configurations into a coupled atmosphere–ocean climate model to test the hypothesis that larger-than-modern ice sheet configurations may have existed at M2. Climate model results are compared with proxy climate data available for M2 to assess the plausibility of each ice sheet configuration. Whilst the outcomes of our data/model comparisons are not in all cases straight forward to interpret, there is little indication that results from model simulations in which significant ice masses have been prescribed in the Northern Hemisphere are incompatible with proxy data from the North Atlantic, Northeast Arctic Russia, North Africa and the Southern Ocean. Therefore, our model results do not preclude the possibility of the existence of larger ice masses during M2 in the Northern or Southern Hemisphere. Specifically they are not able to discount the possibility of significant ice masses in the Northern Hemisphere during the M2 event, consistent with a global sea-level fall of between 40m and 60m. This study highlights the general need for more focused and coordinated data generation in the future to improve the coverage and consistency in proxy records for M2, which will allow these and future M2 sensitivity tests to be interrogated further.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPliocene epoch 3aclimate 3aclimate models 3aice 3aisotopes 3ameteorological data 3asea level 3asimulation models 3aArctic region 3aNorthern Africa 3aRussia 0aPliocene 0aGlacial 0aMarine Isotope Stage M2 0aHadCM3 0aIce sheets1 aHaywood, Alan M.1 aHunter, Stephen J.1 aTindall, Julia C.1 aDowsett, Harry J.1 aHill, Daniel J.1 aPickering, Steven J.0 tGlobal and Planetary Change.g2015 May, v. 128 p.47-60dElsevier B.V.x0921-81817nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gloplacha.2015.02.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03207naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001800152245019000170300001800360520164700378592002802025650001502053650002102068650002202089650000802111650002502119650001102144650001902155650002202174650001902196650001502215650001002230650002502240650002202265650001702287650001902304650001502323650001402338650002602352650002602378650001102404650001202415650001302427700002202440700002302462700002002485773012002505856005502625852000902680655001202689IND4510547320221119164557.0150730e20010715xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND451054732DNAL7 a10.1046/j.1432-1327.2001.02325.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTaguchi, Goro10aMolecular cloning and heterologous expression of novel glucosyltransferases from tobacco cultured cells that have broad substrate specificity and are induced by salicylic acid and auxin  ap. 4086-4094.  aScopoletin is one of the phytoalexins in tobacco. Cells of the Tâ13 cell line (Nicotiana tabacum L. Bright Yellow) accumulate a large amount of scopoletin, also known as 7âhydroxyâ6âmethoxycoumarin, as a glucoconjugate, scopolin, in vacuoles. We report here the molecular cloning of glucosyltransferases that can catalyze the glucosylation of many kinds of secondary metabolites including scopoletin. Two cDNAs encoding glucosyltransferase (NtGT1a and NtGT1b) were isolated from a cDNA library derived from the tobacco Tâ13 cell line by screening with heterologous cDNAs as a probe. The deduced aminoâacid sequences of NtGT1a and NtGT1b exhibited 92% identity with each other, ââ20â50% identities with other reported glucosyltransferases. Heterologous expression of these genes in Escherichia coli showed that the recombinant enzymes had glucosylation activity against both flavonoids and coumarins. They also strongly reacted with 2ânaphthol as a substrate. These recombinant enzymes can utilize UDPâglucose as the sugar donor, but they can also utilize UDPâxylose as a weak donor. RNA blot analysis showed that these genes are induced by salicylic acid and auxin, but the time course of the expression was different. This result is similar to the changes in scopoletin glucosylation activity in these tobacco cells after addition of these plant growth regulators. These results might suggest that one of the roles of the products of these genes is scopoletin glucosylation, in response to salicylic acid and/or auxin, together with the other glucosyltransferases in tobacco cells.  aPublisher supplied data 3a2-naphthol 3aEscherichia coli 3aNicotiana tabacum 3aRNA 3aamino acid sequences 3aauxins 3acDNA libraries 3acomplementary DNA 3acultured cells 3aflavonoids 3agenes 3aglucosyltransferases 3amolecular cloning 3aphytoalexins 3asalicylic acid 3ascopoletin 3ascreening 3asecondary metabolites 3asubstrate specificity 3asugars 3atobacco 3avacuoles1 aYazawa, Teruyoshi1 aHayashida, Nobuaki1 aOkazaki, Mitsuo0 tEuropean journal of biochemistry.g2001 July 15, v. 268, no. 14 p.4086-4094dBlackwell Science Ltdx0014-29567nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1432-1327.2001.02325.x  aDNAL 7aarticle03237naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100003100147245009500178300001800273500001500291520146900306592002801775596009201803650002401895650002001919650002401939650001401963650001701977650001601994650002502010650001002035650001502045650001102060650001002071650001402081650005202095650002002147650001602167650003402183650002802217651001102245653003202256700003502288700003302323700003002356700006802386700002802454773013502482856008102617852000902698655001202707IND60622036920221120232938.0181123e201812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062203692DNAL7 a10.1007/s11250-018-1625-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPaixão, Sonália Ferreira10aBovine viral diarrhea virus subgenotype 1b in water buffalos (Bubalus bubalis) from Brazil  ap. 1947-1950.  a2019-12-06  aSerological studies have characterized the presence of the bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) infection in water buffalo herds worldwide. However, the molecular characterization of BVDV strains circulating in this animal species is uncommon. The aim of this study was to identify young water buffalo with acute infection and characterize the subgenotype of the infecting wild-type BVDV strain. Two dairy water buffalo herds from Northeastern Brazil were selected based on the results of virus neutralization test which showed high titers of anti-BVDV antibodies. To identify viremic animals, the BVDV RNA was assessed by RT-PCR assay in serum samples from 44 asymptomatic young water buffalos, where 31 serum samples from herd A and 13 from herd B. Amplicons with 288 bp of BVDV 5’UTR region were obtained in 7 (15.9%) serum samples (herd A, n = 5; herd B, n = 2). One good-quality amplicon from each herd was selected for nucleotide sequencing. The phylogenetic analysis demonstrated that the two BVDV wild-type strains clustered with BVDV strains of the subgenotype 1b. This study identified for the first time the active infection by BVDV subgenotype 1b in two dairy water buffalo herds from Brazil. These results highlight the importance of that, as well as in cattle herds, also in water buffalo herds prophylaxis measures to control BVDV infection should be intensified, mainly because these species clearly coexist in buffalo farms within Brazil.  aPublisher supplied data  a465725/2014-7cInstituto Nacional de Ciência e Tecnologia em Cadeia Produtiva do Leite 3aserological surveys 3aBubalus bubalis 3ainfectious diseases 3abuffaloes 3aacute course 3ablood serum 3aneutralization tests 3aherds 3aantibodies 3acattle 3afarms 3aphylogeny 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3adisease control 3asubgenotype 3aBovine viral diarrhea virus 1 3a5' untranslated regions 3aBrazil 0aBovine viral diarrhea virus1 aFritzen, Juliana Torres Tomazi1 aCrespo, Sarah Elizabeth Izzo1 ade Moraes Pereira, Helder1 aAlfieri, Alice Fernandes1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7024-44871 aAlfieri, Amauri Alcindo0 tTropical animal health and production.g2018 Dec., v. 50, no. 8 p.1947-1950dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl706x0049-47477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11250-018-1625-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03389naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245013800168300001400306520186100320592002802181650002702209650001102236650001302247650001502260650002002275650003802295650001002333650001202343650001602355650001102371650001402382650000902396650001502405650002102420650001602441651001202457651001602469653002702485653001302512653001102525653002502536653001602561653001402577700001802591700001802609700002002627773011802647856008502765852000902850655001202859IND50071008420221118041444.0190401e20140117xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007100842DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vetpar.2013.10.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPloeger, H.W.10aComparison of two serum and bulk-tank milk ELISAs for diagnosing natural (sub)clinical Dictyocaulus viviparus infection in dairy cows  ap. 50-58.  aLungworm antibody ELISAs developed in Germany (DE) and The Netherlands (NL) were compared using four sets of serum (S) and bulk-tank milk (BTM) samples from adult dairy cows. The samples originated from 37 farms with or without a suspected clinical lungworm infection during August–October 2010 (Dataset 1), from cows excreting lungworm larvae or not during August–October 2010 (n=59) or May–June 2011 (n=164) (Dataset 2), from 305 farms in a national survey during October 2010 (Dataset 3), and 14 zero-grazing farms during February–April 2011 (Dataset 4).During August–October 2010, covering the second half of the grazing season, the NL-S and NL-BTM ELISA outperformed the DE-S and DE-BTM ELISAs in terms of sensitivity. For at least the NL-S and DE-S ELISA the opposite was found during May–June 2011, covering the end of the winter housing period and the early grazing season. Of the 305 farms in the survey 62.6% were found positive with the NL-BTM ELISA, whereas 2.6% was found positive with the DE-BTM ELISA. ODR values for the zero-grazing farms indicated that a cut-off value of 30% for the DE-BTM ELISA might be more appropriate than the currently used 41%. Results suggest that the NL ELISAs also respond to lungworm antigens other than Major Sperm Protein as used in the DE ELISAs.It is concluded that the generally higher sensitivity of the NL-BTM ELISA makes it better suited for large-scale prevalence studies and herd health monitoring programmes than the DE-BTM ELISA, positivity of which is more associated with the presence of clinical lungworm infection. Reducing the cut-off value of the DE-BTM ELISA from the original 49.3% to the current 41% or the possibly more appropriate 30% increased its sensitivity for detecting lungworm infections, but did not lead to similar sensitivity estimates as found for the NL-BTM ELISA.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDictyocaulus viviparus 3aadults 3aantigens 3adairy cows 3adata collection 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3afarms 3agrazing 3aherd health 3alarvae 3alungworms 3amilk 3amonitoring 3anational surveys 3aspermatozoa 3aGermany 3aNetherlands 0aDictyocaulus viviparus 0aLungworm 0aCattle 0aBulk-tank milk ELISA 0aSerum ELISA 0aDiagnosis1 aHolzhauer, M.1 aUiterwijk, M.1 aVan Engelen, E.0 tVeterinary parasitology.g2014 Jan. 17, v. 199, no. 1-2 p.50-58dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl11815x0304-40177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vetpar.2013.10.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03796naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100005400138245015100192300001800343500001900361500002000380520173700400592002802137596007002165596006402235596006402299596006402363650001902427650002002446650001402466650001502480650002002495650002602515650002002541650002402561650002602585650001502611650002302626650001002649650002102659650001202680650000902692650000902701650001802710650001702728650001702745650003302762650001302795700002002808700001302828700001502841700001602856700001702872700005102889700001302940773013602953856007203089852000903161655001203170IND60726292920221120055207.0210203e20210215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072629292DNAL7 a10.1002/ldr.37582doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHu, Wanjin1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6275-459410aSoil bacterial and fungal communities and associated nutrient cycling in relation to rice cultivation history after reclamation of natural wetland  ap. 1287-1300.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe reclamation and utilization of natural wetlands can affect the community structure of soil microorganisms. However, knowledge regarding succession of microbial communities during long‐term reclamation and the links with related nutrient cycles is still limited. Using Illumina sequencing, we identified the patterns and environmental drivers of soil bacterial and fungal succession along a 150‐year chronosequence of paddy fields. Soil enzyme activities were determined to characterize functions related to C, N, and P cycles. The results showed that reclamation activity and its history have greatly altered the bacterial community structure and the bacterial groups. This change being mainly reflected in the bacterial genera Halomonas, genera Isosphaera, and family Planctomycetaceae. The change of fungal community was mainly apparent between natural wetlands and paddy fields, manifested as an increase in the classes Sordariomycetes and Dothideomycetes and a significant decrease inthe class Agaricomycetes in paddy fields compared with natural wetland. Compared with fungi, bacteria were more strongly affected by soil chemical nutrient properties and physical properties. Furthermore, the structural equation model indicated that both bacterial and fungal community structure and diversity had a great influence on the C, N, and P cycles. In summary, the bacterial community was more sensitive throughout the history of rice cultivation after reclamation than the fungal community, but both bacteria and fungi may play major roles in soil ecological functions. These findings contribute to the understanding of ecosystem functional mechanisms, which provides a new perspective for the management of natural wetlands.  aPublisher supplied data  a9202‐0210210807cNanchang University Seed Grant for Biomedicine  a31660149cthe National Natural Science Foundations of China  a31971470cthe National Natural Science Foundations of China  a31560143cthe National Natural Science Foundations of China 3aAgaricomycetes 3aDothideomycetes 3aHalomonas 3aIsosphaera 3aSordariomycetes 3abacterial communities 3achronosequences 3acommunity structure 3aecological succession 3aecosystems 3afungal communities 3afungi 3aland degradation 3apaddies 3arice 3asoil 3asoil bacteria 3asoil ecology 3asoil enzymes 3astructural equation modeling 3awetlands1 aHuang, Lingling1 aHe, Yong1 aLiu, Yajun1 aLiu, Yizhen1 aKong, Zhaoyu1 aWu, Lan1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6954-459X1 aGe, Gang0 tLand degradation & development.g2021 Feb. 15, v. 32, no. 3 p.1287-1300dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.wJournal:jnl54628x1085-32787nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ldr.37583Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03113naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094024002200121024001900143040001800162100001800180245008000198300001800278500002000296500001500316506007600331520108900407592002801496596007201524596007201596596004701668596004701715596005501762596005301817596005301870596005301923506003701976650002302013650002102036650002102057650001502078650002102093650002302114650001002137650001802147653001002165700001802175700001502193700001602208700001502224700001802239700005902257700002102316773011602337856007302453852000902526655001202535IND60666296120221207111420.0190917e201909  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066629612DNAL7 a10.1111/tpj.144152doi7 aPMC67443062pmcid7 a311123142pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBai, Mengjuan14aThe B‐box protein BBX19 suppresses seed germination via induction of ABI5  ap. 1192-1202.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  a2019-12-06  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aSeed germination is a fundamental process in the plant life cycle and is regulated by functionally opposing internal and external inputs. Here we explored the role of a negative regulator of photomorphogenesis, a B‐box‐containing protein (BBX19), as a molecular link between the inhibitory action of the phytohormone abscisic acid (ABA) and the promoting role of light in germination. We show that seeds of BBX19‐overexpressing lines, in contrast to those of BBX19 RNA interference lines, display ABA hypersensitivity, albeit independently of elongated hypocotyl 5 (HY5). Moreover, we establish that BBX19 functions neither via perturbation of GA signaling, the ABA antagonistic phytohormone, nor through interference with the DELLA protein germination repressors. Rather, BBX19 functions as an inducer of ABA INSENSITIVE5 (ABI5) by binding to the light‐responsive GT1 motifs in the gene promoter. In summary, we identify BBX19 as a regulatory checkpoint, directing diverse developmental processes and tailoring adaptive responses to distinct endogenous and exogenous signals.  aPublisher supplied data  aKYYJ201706cFundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities  aBE2016377cKey Research and Development Project of Jiangsu Province  aU1803102cNSFC‐XINJIANG Joint Foundation  a31801890cNSFC‐XINJIANG Joint Foundation  a2016M600425cChina Postdoctoral Science Foundation  aIOS‐1036491cNational Science Foundation (NSF)  aIOS‐1352478cNational Science Foundation (NSF)  aR01GM107311cNational Institutes of Health (NIH)0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aphotomorphogenesis 3aseed germination 3aRNA interference 3ahypocotyls 3agibberellic acid 3alinkage (genetics) 3agenes 3aabscisic acid 0aseeds1 aSun, Jingjing1 aLiu, Jinyi1 aRen, Haoran1 aWang, Kang1 aWang, Yanling1 aWang, Changquan1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2668-65411 aDehesh, Katayoon0 tplant journal.g2019 Sept., v. 99, no. 6 p.1192-1202dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl47643x0960-74127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/tpj.144153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03354naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245013900167300001800306500001500324520179900339592002802138650002002166650002702186650001602213650001302229650001902242650001502261650001402276650002402290650001302314650001702327650003802344650001702382650003402399650001302433650001102446650001102457651001302468653003202481700002002513700002002533700002102553700002802574700002102602773013502623856008102758852000902839655001202848IND60622037020221120232757.0181123e201812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062203702DNAL7 a10.1007/s11250-018-1624-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAragaw, Kassaye10aSeroprevalence and factors associated with bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) infection in dairy cattle in three milksheds in Ethiopia  ap. 1821-1827.  a2019-12-06  aThis work was conducted to estimate the seroprevalence, to identify potential factors that influence seroprevalence of bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV), and to investigate the association between BVDV serostatus and occurrence of reproductive disorders in dairy cattle in three milksheds in Ethiopia. A total of 1379 serum samples were obtained from cattle randomly selected from 149 herds from three milksheds representing central, southern, and western Ethiopia. Sera samples were examined for bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) antibodies using commercial competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kit. Logistic regression analysis was employed to investigate associations between risk factors and the risk of BVDV seroprevalence, and BVDV serostatus and reproductive disorders. Seroreaction to BVDV antigens was detected in 32.6% of the 1379 cattle and 69.8% of the 149 herds sampled. Factors associated with BVDV seroplevalence were age, breed, and herd size (P < 0.05). Adult cattle ≥ 18 months old had 2.1 (95% CI 1.5, 3.1) times the odds of BVDV seroreaction than younger cattle. Holstein-Friesian (HF) local crosses (OR = 2.1, 95% CI 1.3, 3.4) and HFs (OR = 1.3, 95% CI 0.9, 1.9) were more likely to be seropositive than Jersey and the odds of seropositivity in cattle in large herds with 11 or more animals were higher (OR = 1.8, 95% CI 1.3, 2.5) than the odds of BVDV seropositivity in smaller herds. Seroprevalence was not associated with geographical region (P > 0.05). Risk of reproductive disorders was not affected by BVDV serostatus, except for repeat breeding (P > 0.05). The present study demonstrated that BVDV has wide distribution in the country being detected in all the 15 conurbations and 69.8% of herds involved in the study.  aPublisher supplied data 3acattle diseases 3areproductive disorders 3ablood serum 3aantigens 3aseroprevalence 3aantibodies 3aherd size 3aregression analysis 3acrossing 3adairy cattle 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3arisk factors 3aBovine viral diarrhea virus 1 3aHolstein 3aJersey 3aadults 3aEthiopia 0aBovine viral diarrhea virus1 aSibhat, Berhanu1 aAyelet, Gelagay1 aSkjerve, Eystein1 aGebremedhin, Endrias Z.1 aAsmare, Kassahun0 tTropical animal health and production.g2018 Dec., v. 50, no. 8 p.1821-1827dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl706x0049-47477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11250-018-1624-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01868naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002200152245021400174300001400388520055200402592002800954650001500982650001200997650002601009650001501035650001201050650001601062650001301078650001801091650000901109650000901118653002701127653000901154653003001163653001301193700003001206700002201236773010401258856008701362852000901449655001201458IND60552942820221123042559.0180830e20160605xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055294282DNAL7 a10.1016/j.colsurfa.2016.02.0382doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAbbasi, Amir Reza10aSynthesis and characterization of azine-functionalized zinc cation metal–organic frameworks nanostructures upon silk fibers under ultrasound irradiation, study of pores effect on morphine adsorption affinity  ap. 58-65.  aThin films of a three-dimensional porous Zn(II)-MOFs (TMU-4 and TMU-5) were deposited on surfaces of silk fiber via a stepwise manner under ultrasound irradiation.

Dicarbonyl compounds such as methylglyoxal (MGO) have been identified as the predominant source for the formation of advanced glycation end-products (AGEs) in various tissues. We investigated the effect of 13 micronutrients on MGO-mediated in vitro glycation of bovine serum albumin (BSA), as formation of AGEs and protein carbonyls. BSA (10 mg/ml) was incubated at 37°C with 100 mM MGO for 24 hours, in presence of ascorbic acid, Trolox (water-soluble α-tocopherol analog), β-carotene, retinol, riboflavin, thiamin, folic acid, niacin, pyridoxine, zinc, iron, manganese, and selenium. Fluorescence was measured at the wavelength pair of 370 and 440 nm as an index of the formation of AGEs and spectra were recorded for promising interactions at λex = 280 nm and λex = 370 nm. Within four standard antiglycating agents, aminoguanidine showed highest inhibitory response for BSA glycation followed by quercetin, gallic acid, and tannic acid. Promising antiglycation potential was seen for Trolox, riboflavin, Zn, and Mn as evidenced by decrease in the formation of AGEs and protein carbonyls.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalpha-tocopherol 3aascorbic acid 3abeta-carotene 3abovine serum albumin 3adiabetes 3afluorescence 3afolic acid 3agallic acid 3aglycation 3airon 3amanganese 3aniacin 3apyridoxine 3aquercetin 3ariboflavin 3aselenium 3atannins 3athiamin 3avitamin A 3awavelengths 3azinc 2aAnimals 2aAscorbic Acidxpharmacology 2aCattle 2aChromansxpharmacology 2aFolic Acidxpharmacology 2aGlycosylationxdrug effects 2aGlycation End Products, Advancedxmetabolism. 2aIronxpharmacology 2aManganesexpharmacology 2aMicronutrientsxpharmacology 2aPyridoxinexpharmacology 2aPyruvaldehydexchemistry 2aRiboflavinxchemistry 2aSeleniumxpharmacology 2aSerum Albumin, Bovinexchemistry 2aThiaminexpharmacology 2aVitamin Axchemistry 2aZincxpharmacology 2abeta Carotenexpharmacology1 aAgte, Vaishali V.0 tBiological trace element research.g2011 Nov., v. 143, no. 2 p.717-725dSpringer-Verlagx0163-49847nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12011-010-8915-7  aDNAL 7aarticle03723naa a2200709 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100006700151245010100218520155600319592002801875650000801903650002101911650001501932650002501947650001601972650001301988650001802001650001602019650004002035650001802075650001202093650001402105650001802119650002102137650001002158650002002168650003302188650001702221650002102238653001702259653001502276653001902291653000802310653000802318653000802326653000802334653000902342653000802351653000902359653000802368653001002376653000702386653000802393653000702401653000802408653001002416700006102426700005902487700006402546700003402610700006402644700001902708700005902727773012002786856008602906852000902992655001203001IND60753794320221116162209.0220118e202202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075379432DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jnutbio.2021.1088852doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRanaweera, Sachithra S.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9589-324010aAnti-obesity effect of sulforaphane in broccoli leaf extract on 3T3-L1 adipocytes and ob/ob mice  aThe present study evaluated the anti-obesity effect of sulforaphane (SFN) and glucoraphanin (GRN) in broccoli leaf extract (BLE) on 3T3-L1 adipocytes and ob/ob mice. Based on Oil Red O staining and triglyceride (TG) assay, SFN and BLE significantly reduced (P<.05) both lipid accumulation and TG content in the differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes. SFN and BLE increased 2-NBDG uptake by 3T3-L1 adipocytes in a dose-dependent manner. Western blot analysis confirmed that SFN and BLE increased the phosphorylation levels of both AMPK (Thr172) and ACC (Ser79), and reduced the expression of HMGCR in liver and white adipose tissues of ob/ob mice. Histological analysis revealed that SFN and BLE ameliorated hepatic steatosis, and reduced the size of adipocyte in ob/ob mice. Treatment with SFN and BLE significantly reduced (P<.05) TG content, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, total cholesterol (TC), and glucose in the serum of ob/ob mice. RNA sequencing analysis showed that up- or down-regulation of 32 genes related to lipid metabolism was restored to control level in both SFN and BLE-treated ob/ob mice groups. A protein-protein interaction (PPI) network was constructed via STRING analysis, and Srebf2, Pla2g2c, Elovl5, Plb1, Ctp1a, Lipin1, Fgfr1, and Plcg1 were located in the functional hubs of the PPI network of lipid metabolism. Overall results suggest that the SFN content in BLE exerts a potential anti-obesity effect by normalizing the expression of genes related to lipid metabolism, which are up- or down-regulated in ob/ob mice.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRNA 3aWestern blotting 3aadipocytes 3aanti-obesity effects 3ablood serum 3abroccoli 3adose response 3afatty liver 3afibroblast growth factor receptor 1 3aglucoraphanin 3aglucose 3ahistology 3aleaf extracts 3alipid metabolism 3aliver 3aphosphorylation 3aprotein-protein interactions 3asulforaphane 3atriacylglycerols 0aAnti-obesity 0aob/ob mice 0aRNA sequencing 0aBLE 0aMET 0aSFN 0aGRN 0aUPLC 0aPEF 0aAMPK 0aACC 0aHMGCR 0aTC 0aLDL 0aTG 0aPPI 0aNAFLD1 aNatraj, Premkumar1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0638-58081 aRajan, Priyanka1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2615-38091 aDayarathne, Laksi A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5679-49521 aMihindukulasooriya, Suyama P.1 aDinh, Duong Thi Thuy1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9664-12641 aJee, Youngheun1 aHan, Chang-Hoon1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0763-95900 tJournal of nutritional biochemistry.g2022 Feb., v. 100 p.108885-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl44770x0955-28637nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jnutbio.2021.1088853Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03389naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100003000147245009700177300001600274520192200290592002802212650001002240650001702250650001202267650001302279650001202292650001502304650000802319650001402327650002102341650002102362650001502383650001102398650002202409650002302431650001602454650000902470651001102479700002402490700002502514700002202539700002402561700002702585700002802612700002502640700002402665773009202689856008102781852000902862655001202871IND60520320320221119185718.0160519e201606  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052032032DNAL7 a10.1007/s10453-015-9392-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCalderón-Ezquerro, M. C.10aFirst airborne pollen calendar for Mexico City and its relationship with bioclimatic factors  ap. 225-244.  aThe worldwide human population suffering from allergies continues to increase. Pollen grains are a major source of airborne allergens and significant cause of these diseases. Therefore, continuous monitoring of pollen grains released and transported in the air locally or regionally is required to determine the prevalence of various pollen types and identify intra-day and intra-annual seasonal variations over time. In this study, we developed the first pollen calendar for Mexico City, which includes a large variety of taxa, many of which show a long Main Pollen Season which may last throughout the year. The analysis and comparison of daily, monthly and annual values showed that the occurrence and abundance of the main types of aero-allergenic pollen in the atmosphere were species of Fraxinus, Cupressaceae and Alnus, which occur during the periods from December through March, whereas airborne pollens of several species of Poaceae and Urticaceae occurred throughout the year. The variation in pollen concentration showed that the greatest intra-diurnal variations occurred during the second half of the day. Regarding the relationship of pollen with bioclimatic factors, the increase in temperature favoured the presence of pollen in the air, whereas the increase in pluvial precipitation and relative humidity was associated with a decrease in airborne pollen. Large tracts of the Valley of Mexico have atmospheric conditions that are conducive to the accumulation of airborne particles, including pollen. Anomalous winds from the southeast dominated the surface wind variability during the first months of 2010. These patterns induced extreme values in wind convergence at the lower levels of the atmosphere, which resulted in high concentrations of pollen at our sampling site. We suggest that these conditions are related to the warm phase of the El Niño Southern Oscillation phenomenon (2009–2010).  aPublisher supplied data 3aAlnus 3aCupressaceae 3aEl Nino 3aFraxinus 3aPoaceae 3aUrticaceae 3aair 3aallergens 3ahuman population 3ahypersensitivity 3amonitoring 3apollen 3arelative humidity 3aseasonal variation 3atemperature 3awind 3aMexico1 aGuerrero-Guerra, C.1 aMartínez-López, B.1 aFuentes-Rojas, F.1 aTéllez-Unzueta, F.1 aLópez-Espinoza, E.

The dynamic conformational equilibrium of trimeric Env influences its antigenicity and potential immunogenicity. Antibodies that bind at the trimer apex stabilize a “closed” conformation characteristic of the most difficult to neutralize isolates. A goal of vaccine development is therefore to mimic the closed conformation in a designed immunogen. A disulfide-stabilized, trimeric Env ectodomain—the “SOSIP” construct—has many of the relevant properties; it is also particularly suitable for structure determination. Some single-molecule studies have, however, suggested that the SOSIP trimer is not a good representation of Env on the surface of a virion or an infected cell. We isolated Env (fully cleaved to gp120 and gp41) from the surface of expressing cells using tagged, apex-binding Fab PG16 and determined the structure of the PG16-Env complex by cryo-EM to an overall resolution of 4.6 Å. Placing the only purification tag on the Fab ensured that the isolated Env was continuously stabilized in its closed, native conformation. The Env structure in this complex corresponds closely to the SOSIP structures determined by both x-ray crystallography and cryo-EM. Although the membrane-interacting elements are not resolved in our reconstruction, we can make inferences about the connection between ectodomain and membrane-proximal external region (MPER) by reference to the published cryo-tomography structure of an Env “spike” and the NMR structure of the MPER-transmembrane segment. We discuss these results in view of the conflicting interpretations in the literature.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aHuman immunodeficiency virus 1 3aX-ray diffraction 3aantigens 3aconformational isomerization 3aimmunogenicity 3aneutralization 3aneutralizing antibodies 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3avaccine development 3avaccines 3avirion 0acryo-EM 0acleaved gp160 0abroadly neutralizing antibody 0aimmunogen design1 aPeng, Hanqin1 aChen, Bing1 aHarrison, Stephen C.0 tJournal of molecular biology.g2020 Feb. 14, v. 432, no. 4 p.1158-1168dElsevier LtdwJournal:12469x0022-28367nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jmb.2019.11.0283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02585naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002100140245016600161300001800327520118400345592002801529650002501557650002101582650001501603650001701618650001501635650002601650650002401676650001301700650000901713650001601722650001201738650000901750650001401759650001501773650001301788650001301801700001501814700001801829700002801847700002801875773014101903856007402044852000902118655001202127IND60671268920221119022004.0191002e20150805xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067126892DNAL7 a10.1039/c5tb00676g2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMajumder, Joydeb10aCetirizine derived supramolecular topical gel in action: rational design, characterization and in vivo self-delivery application in treating skin allergy in mice  ap. 6634-6644.  aA conventional drug delivery system requires a delivery vehicle which often faces various problems such as inefficient drug loading into the delivery vehicle and its release, cytotoxicity and biodegradability of the delivery vehicle, etc., whereas a supramolecular gel based self-delivery system delivers a gelator drug at the target site without using any vehicle thereby getting rid of such problems. Here, a simple salt formation strategy has been employed to convert a well known anti-allergic drug (cetirizine) to a supramolecular gelator for the purpose of making a topical gel for in vivo self-delivery applications. The salt of cetirizine and tyramine (salt 3) displays excellent gelation properties in methylsalicylate/menthol. The gels are characterised by electron microscopy, and table top- and dynamic rheology. The gelator salt 3 displays excellent physiological stability in phosphate buffer saline (PBS) and it is biocompatible in mouse macrophage RAW 264.7 and mouse myoblast C2C12 cell lines. A methylsalicylate/menthol topical gel of salt 3 is successfully self-delivered in treating the 2,4-dinitrochlorobenzene (DNCB)-induced allergic skin condition in mice.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanti-allergic agents 3abiodegradability 3acell lines 3acytotoxicity 3adermatitis 3adrug delivery systems 3aelectron microscopy 3agelation 3agels 3amacrophages 3amenthol 3amice 3amyoblasts 3aphosphates 3arheology 3atyramine1 aDeb, Jolly1 aHusain, Ahmad1 aJana, Siddhartha Sankar1 aDastidar, Parthasarathi0 tJournal of materials chemistry B.g2015 Aug. 5, v. 3, no. 32 p.6634-6644dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26902x2050-75187nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c5tb00676g3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03516naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100002200155245015300177520197600330592002802306650003202334650001002366650001702376650002302393650003002416650001102446650001802457650001902475650002202494650001502516650001802531650002202549650002502571650004802596650001502644650001402659650002402673653002202697653001802719653003702737653002302774653001702797700002202814773009902836856009002935852000903025655001203034IND60747140220221120224141.0211017e20220115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074714022DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aquaculture.2021.7373182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNakayama, Natsuko14aThe importance of the genetic diversity of the HcRNAV ssRNA virus in the viral-based bloom control of the dinoflagellate Heterocapsa circularisquama  aThe HcRNAV virus has been used to control the blooms of the harmful dinoflagellate Heterocapsa circularisquama through the spraying of autochthonous sediment containing HcRNAV from prior blooms. When using natural substances for harmful algal bloom (HAB) control, the effects on local ecosystems must be ascertained and minimized. Specifically, HcRNAV is a single-stranded RNA virus which replicates with an extremely high mutation rate, leading to significant genetic diversity. Here we demonstrate the genetic diversity of HcRNAV in natural sediments analyzed through the use of the clone library approach and Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) analysis based on the major capsid protein (MCP) sequence of HcRNAV. The sediment samples were collected over four developmental phases, including low- and high- density phases of H. circularisquama blooms in the saltwater Lake Kamo, Niigata, and Mikawa Bay, Aichi, Japan. The HcRNAV sequences obtained from both methods were divided into only two groups (UA2 and CY groups), with most of the sequences classified into the UA2 group. Haplotype network analysis, which is used to reveal the genealogical relationships among haplotypes, has indicated that the HcRNAV sequences varied according to time and location. This analysis suggested that HcRNAV does not randomly diversify, thus indicating that the diversity of HcRNAV might be undergoing a process of natural selection. Furthermore, the present cluster in the haplotype network was consistent with the cross-reactivity tests infecting the H. circularisquama strains with isolated HcRNAV clones. These results suggest that HcRNAV consists of several clusters that are evolving as genetically diverse populations, termed quasispecies. Hence, our findings indicate that for effective utilization, it is necessary to collect and pool sediments containing HcRNAV from multiple local sites and periods to provide more diversity in the viral populations used for bloom control.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHeterocapsa circularisquama 3aJapan 3aalgal blooms 3abiological control 3abiological control agents 3acapsid 3acoat proteins 3across reaction 3agenetic variation 3ahaplotypes 3amutation rate 3anatural selection 3anucleotide sequences 3apositive sense, single-stranded RNA viruses 3asalt lakes 3asediments 3aviral core proteins 0aGenetic diversity 0aClone library 0aNext Generation Sequencing (NGS) 0aHcRNAV infectivity 0aQuasispecies1 aHamaguchi, Masami0 tAquaculture.g2022 Jan. 15, v. 546 p.737318-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl59663x0044-84867nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquaculture.2021.7373183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03717naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002200140245016800162300001800330520194800348592002802296650004402324650003702368650002802405650001702433650002102450650002302471650002102494650001302515650001902528650003002547650002002577650002102597650001502618650002202633650001702655650001802672650002502690650001402715650001902729650001302748650003302761650002402794650001102818650001802829650001702847650001702864650001902881650001102900700001602911773014102927856007403068852000903142655001203151IND60671269120221119021818.0191002e20150708xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067126912DNAL7 a10.1039/c5tb00678c2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPrasad, Bhim Bali10aDevelopment of molecularly imprinted polymer nanoarrays of N-acryloyl-2-mercaptobenzamide on a silver electrode for ultratrace sensing of uracil and 5-fluorouracil  ap. 5864-5876.  aThe present work describes a new, simple and easy method for the generation of novel molecularly imprinted polymer-based nanoarrays with uracil and 5-fluorouracil as template(s) on the surface of a silver electrode. The procedure involved electrochemical etching of silver-wire to develop nanopores on its tip. In these nanopores, a prepolymer mixture with template(s) was filled-in via spin coating and subjected to free radical thermal polymerization. The bulk polymer and polymer film characteristics were investigated using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, and atomic force microscopy. The prepolymerization complex stoichiometry involved one template molecule and two molecules of the N-acryloyl-2-mercaptobenzamide functional monomer. The molecular structure of this complex was thermodynamically optimized via density functional theory at the MP2/6-31+G(d,p) level. The nanoarrays, vertically tethered imprinted polymer brushes with embedded carbon nanotubes, helped enhancing the surface area of the electrode. This drastically facilitated unhindered vertical diffusion with selective binding of uracil and 5-fluorouracil and their sensitive analysis using differential pulse anodic stripping voltammetry, with detection limits as low as 0.50 and 0.33 ng mL⁻¹ (S/N = 3), respectively. The proposed nanoscale electro-chemical sensor was also validated with the complex matrices of blood plasma and pharmaceutics which assured reliable results, without any matrix effect, cross-reactivity, and false-positives.

The hydroxybutyl starch prepared by acid-base synergistic pretreatment had the highest degree of substitution. Relative to the native starch, the surface of hydroxybutyl starch particles was smoother and rounder. The formation, microstructure, and properties of temperature-sensitive hydrogels were also determined in this work. The results indicated that the temperature-sensitive hydrogels containing hydroxybutyl starch had irregular pore structures and higher water absorption rates. As the starch content increased, the pore size of these hydrogels increased and then decreased, the water absorption rate increased and the deswelling rate decreased. The equilibrium swelling ratio of the hydrogel prepared by hydroxybutyl starch was greater than that of native starch.  aPublisher supplied data 3acorn starch 3afood chemistry 3ahydrogels 3amicrostructure 3aporosity 3apretreatment 3astarch 3awater uptake 3awaxy corn 0aHydroxybutyl starch 0aTemperature-sensitive 0aHydrogels1 aHao, Yacheng1 aLi, Sai1 aLuo, Zhigang1 aGao, Qunyu0 tFood chemistry.g2021 Sept. 01, v. 355 p.129472-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl8139x0308-81467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2021.1294723Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03855naa a2200841 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001300152245012900165300001600294520160600310592002801916650002501944650004301969650001302012650000902025650001602034650001902050650001202069650002002081650001202101650003102113650002402144650001002168650002402178650002202202650001102224650001902235650001102254650001502265650002102280650001502301650001202316650002002328650002402348650002102372650002102393650002502414650001302439650002202452653000802474653000802482653000802490653000802498653000802506653000802514653000902522653000802531653000702539653001202546653000802558653000802566653001902574653001902593653001302612653004002625653001202665653001102677700001602688700001502704700001502719700001702734700001902751700001402770700001602784773010502800856008702905852000902992655001203001IND60541240320221119052456.0190318e201502  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054124032DNAL7 a10.1016/j.plantsci.2014.12.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Hui10aOverexpression of ShDHN, a dehydrin gene from Solanum habrochaites enhances tolerance to multiple abiotic stresses in tomato  ap. 198-211.  aDehydrins (DHNs) play important roles in plant adaptation to abiotic stress. In this study, a cold-induced SK3-type DHN gene (ShDHN) isolated from wild tomato species Solanum habrochaites was characterized for its function in abiotic stress tolerance. ShDHN was constitutively expressed in root, leaf, stem, flower and fruit. ShDHN was continuously up-regulated during cold stress and showed higher expression level in the cold-tolerant S. habrochaites than in the susceptible S. lycopersicum. Moreover, ShDHN expression was also regulated by drought, salt, osmotic stress, and exogenous signaling molecules. Overexpression of ShDHN in cultivated tomato increased tolerance to cold and drought stresses and improved seedling growth under salt and osmotic stresses. Compared with the wild-type, the transgenic plants accumulated more proline, maintained higher enzymatic activities of superoxide dismutase and catalase, and suffered less membrane damage under cold and drought stresses. Moreover, the transgenic plants accumulated lower levels of H2O2 and O2− under cold stress, and had higher relative water contents and lower water loss rates under dehydration conditions. Furthermore, overexpression of ShDHN in tomato led to the up- or down-regulated expression of several genes involved in ROS scavenging and JA signaling pathway, including SOD1, GST, POD, LOX, PR1 and PR2. Taken together, these results indicate that ShDHN has pleiotropic effects on improving plant adaptation to abiotic stresses and that it possesses potential usefulness in genetic improvement of stress tolerance in tomato.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSolanum habrochaites 3aSolanum lycopersicum var. lycopersicum 3acatalase 3acold 3acold stress 3acold tolerance 3adrought 3aenzyme activity 3aflowers 3agene expression regulation 3agene overexpression 3agenes 3agenetic improvement 3ahydrogen peroxide 3aleaves 3aosmotic stress 3aoxygen 3aperoxidase 3aplant adaptation 3apleiotropy 3aproline 3aseedling growth 3asignal transduction 3astress tolerance 3asuperoxide anion 3asuperoxide dismutase 3atomatoes 3atransgenic plants 0aABA 0aCAT 0aDHN 0aGST 0aLEA 0aMDA 0aMeJA 0aPOD 0aPR 0aqRT-PCR 0aROS 0aSOD 0aAbiotic stress 0aCold tolerance 0aDehydrin 0aLate embryogenesis abundant protein 0aSolanum 0aTomato1 aYu, Chuying1 aLi, Hanxia1 aOuyang, Bo1 aWang, Taotao1 aZhang, Junhong1 aWang, Xin1 aYe, Zhibiao0 tPlant science.g2015 Feb., v. 231 p.198-211dElsevier Ireland LtdwJournal:jnl38764x0168-94527nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.plantsci.2014.12.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02903naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003600092040001800128100002200146245011200168300001600280520137700296592002801673650001301701650001101714650001201725650001401737650000901751650001401760650001501774650001301789650000901802650001201811650002101823650001501844650001101859650003101870650001001901650001301911650001101924650002401935650001901959650003101978650002602009700001602035700001502051700001502066700001902081700001802100700001802118700001902136773010302155856008202258852000902340655001202349IND4471776820221122185710.0141111e201208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447177682DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcpa.2012.01.0212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCherrington, B.D.10aComparative Analysis of Peptidylarginine Deiminase-2 Expression in Canine, Feline and Human Mammary Tumours  ap. 139-146.  aThe peptidylarginine deiminase (PAD) enzyme family converts arginine residues in proteins to citrulline. In the canine mammary gland, PAD2 expression is first detected in epithelial cells in oestrus and becomes more widely expressed during dioestrus. PAD2 appears to modify nuclear histones, suggesting a role for the enzyme in chromatin remodelling and gene regulation. Recent evidence suggests that PAD2 plays a role in gene regulation in primary human breast epithelial cells. PAD2 may therefore be involved in gene regulation as it relates to mammary development, the oestrus cycle and potentially to neoplasia. The aim of the present study was to determine whether PAD2 expression was increased or decreased in mammary carcinoma compared with normal mammary tissue. A human mammary tissue microarray and archival surgical biopsy tissues from canine and feline mammary tumours were used to demonstrate differential expression of PAD2 in mammary carcinoma that appeared to be consistent across species. Normal human and canine mammary epithelium showed strong cytoplasmic and nuclear expression of PAD2, but there was reduced PAD2 expression in mammary carcinomas from both species. Feline mammary carcinomas had complete loss of nuclear PAD2 expression. Loss of nuclear PAD2 expression may therefore represent a marker of progression towards more aggressive neoplasia.  aPublisher supplied data 3aarginine 3abiopsy 3abreasts 3acarcinoma 3acats 3achromatin 3acitrulline 3adiestrus 3adogs 3aenzymes 3aepithelial cells 3aepithelium 3aestrus 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3ahistones 3ahumans 3amammary development 3amammary glands 3amammary neoplasms (animal) 3amicroarray technology1 aMohanan, S.1 aDiep, A.N.1 aFleiss, R.1 aSudilovsky, D.1 aAnguish, L.J.1 aCoonrod, S.A.1 aWakshlag, J.J.0 tJournal of comparative pathology.g2012 , v. 147, no. 2-3 p.139-146dElsevier Ltdx0021-99757nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcpa.2012.01.0213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03305naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100002000112245013500132300001600267520191500283592002802198650002302226650001802249650002802267650002302295650001102318650001202329650001602341650001402357650001602371650001202387650003102399650001602430650001102446650001402457650002302471650001402494650002402508650001102532650001402543650001002557653001902567653002002586653002302606653002502629700002902654773011902683852000902802655001202811IND60595009020221119232521.0180525e201701  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059500902DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWhite, Scott N.10aPotential Role of Sequential Glufosinate and Foramsulfuron Applications for Management of Fescues (Festuca spp.) in Wild Blueberry  ap. 100-110.  aSheep and hair fescue are perennial, tuft forming grasses that spread by seed and form dense sods in wild blueberry fields. These sods compete with the crop for resources and hinder harvest. Field and greenhouse studies were conducted in 2015 to evaluate 1) the effect of sequential glufosinate and foramsulfuron applications on suppression of fescues in the greenhouse and field, and 2) efficacy of glufosinate and foramsulfuron on fescue seedlings when applied at 2, 4, 6, and 8 wk after seedling emergence in the greenhouse. Glufosinate applications at 750 and 1,005 g ai ha⁻¹ followed by foramsulfuron application at 35 g ai ha⁻¹ reduced fescue leaf number and biomass relative to foramsulfuron application alone in the greenhouse. In the field study, fescue flowering tuft density, tuft inflorescence height, seed production, and seed viability were reduced by foramsulfuron alone, but there was a trend towards lower seed production and tuft height when fescues were treated with glufosinate at 1,005 g ha⁻¹ followed by foramsulfuron. Foramsulfuron caused low seedling mortality at all application timings evaluated, but glufosinate caused >90% mortality in seedlings when applied at 2, 4, 6, or 8 wk after seedling emergence. Our results suggest that sequential applications of these herbicides are less effective under field conditions relative to results obtained in the greenhouse, though burndown glufosinate applications may have a role in reducing fescue seedling recruitment. Additional research should be conducted to determine the effect of early spring and autumn glufosinate applications on fescue seedling recruitment and suppression of established fescue tufts with subsequent foramsulfuron applications.

Betulin has three most significant positions, i.e., primary hydroxyl group at position C-28, secondary hydroxyl group at position C-3, and alkene moiety at position C-20, where chemical modifications were performed to yield pharmacologically more active derivatives. Bioconversion optimization was performed for the enhancement in the percentage of conversion using statistical approach by opting temperature, pH and betulin concentration as independent variables. Three hundred fifty isolates were screened from natural sources under selective medium containing up to 3 g/l of betulin for their tolerance and bioconversion efficiency. Isolate KD235 was found to grow in 3 g/l betulin with 23.34 ± 0.57 g/l biomass and 0.67 ± 0.06 g/l betulinic acid production. New isolate KD235 was characterized by molecular analysis and named as Bacillus megaterium KD235. Molecular characterization of a potentially active isolate for the transformation of betulin to betulinic acid was suggested as isolate Bacillus megaterium KD235. Maximum bioconversion (22 ± 1.5%) was found at optimized conditions, i.e., pH 6.5, temperature 30 °C and at 3 g/l betulin. Validations of experiments as ~11% more bioconversion i.e., 1 ± 0.1 g/l betulinic acid were obtained using 5 l lab fermenter as compared to shake flask.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aBacillus megaterium 3aantineoplastic activity 3aantiretroviral agents 3abetulin 3abetulinic acid 3abiomass 3abiotransformation 3aculture flasks 3afermenters 3amoieties 3apH 3aselective media 3astatistical analysis 3atemperature1 aDubey, Kashyap Kumar0 t3 Biotech.g2017 July, v. 7, no. 3 p.157-157dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx2190-572X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13205-017-0759-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02286naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001500140245008400155300001800239520111700257592002801374650001501402650000901417650002701426650002301453650001701476650001401493650002201507650001301529650002101542700001601563700001601579700001401595700002401609700001601633700001501649773014101664856007401805852000901879655001201888IND60671269320221119021755.0191002e20150701xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067126932DNAL7 a10.1039/c5tb00681c2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Hong10aMechanically strong hybrid double network hydrogels with antifouling properties  ap. 5426-5435.  aThe development of mechanically tough and biocompatible polymer hydrogels has great potential and promise for many applications. Herein, we synthesized a new type of hybrid physically-chemically crosslinked Agar/PAM double network (DN) hydrogel using a simple, one-pot method. Agar/PAM gels are designed with desirable/balanced mechanical properties by varying the network-forming parameters. Among them, a strong Agar/PAM DN gel achieves the highest tensile stress of 3.3 MPa at failure strain of 2400%, while a tough DN gel achieves the tensile strain of 3700% at failure stress of 2.8 MPa. Besides excellent mechanical properties, Agar/PAM DN hydrogels exhibited excellent antifouling properties to highly resist protein adsorption, cell adhesion, and bacterial attachment, as well as the free shapeable property to form any complex shapes. The relationship between mechanical properties and antifouling performance was discussed. We hope that the combination of the mechanical and antifouling properties in Agar/PAM gels will make them as promising “biomimetic” materials for many bio-inert applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3aagar 3aantifouling activities 3abacterial adhesion 3acrosslinking 3ahydrogels 3amechanical stress 3apolymers 3atensile strength1 aChen, Qiang1 aHu, Rundong1 aWang, Hua1 aNewby, Bi-min Zhang1 aChang, Yung1 aZheng, Jie0 tJournal of materials chemistry B.g2015 July 1, v. 3, no. 27 p.5426-5435dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26902x2050-75187nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c5tb00681c3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02348naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002200143245009800165300001700263520119100280592002801471650001601499650001401515650002301529650001601552650001101568650001601579650001601595650001501611650001301626650002201639653001201661653001201673653000901685653001601694653002701710773012701737856007701864852000901941655001201950IND60517172220221120215400.0160328e201509  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051717222DNAL7 a10.4141/cjps-2014-3702doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJitsuyama, Yutaka10aMorphological root responses of soybean to rhizosphere hypoxia reflect waterlogging tolerance  ap. 999-1005.  aJitsuyama, Y. 2015. Morphological root responses of soybean to rhizosphere hypoxia reflect waterlogging tolerance. Can. J. Plant Sci. 95: 999–1005. Excess soil moisture induces hypoxia, causing waterlogging injury in soybeans [Glycine max (L.) Merr.]. Twelve Japanese soybean cultivars with varying hypoxia tolerance were used. Of these, 11 (all but Hayahikari) were evaluated for waterlogging tolerance using a scaled index with data from previous studies. To investigate hypoxic responses, cultivars were grown under hydroponic conditions for 2 wk a year for 2 yr, with aerobic or hypoxic oxygen concentrations artificially maintained in the rhizosphere. Hypoxic responses (measured as plant dry weight and root morphology) were assessed at the early vegetative stage. The effects of hypoxic treatment on root dry weight were significant, and the effect of year on soybean dry weight was not significant. The change in root dry weight, and particularly, in coarse root length, was significantly correlated with waterlogging tolerance index at the 0.001 probability level. This study showed that root responses to rhizosphere hypoxia might reflect waterlogging tolerance in soybeans.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGlycine max 3acultivars 3aflooded conditions 3ahydroponics 3aoxygen 3aprobability 3arhizosphere 3asoil water 3asoybeans 3avegetative growth 0aHypoxia 0asoybean 0aroot 0atemperature 0awaterlogging tolerance0 tCanadian journal of plant science.g2015 Sept., v. 95, no. 5 p.999-1005dAgricultural Institute of Canadax1918-18337nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.4141/cjps-2014-3703Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02324naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001800152245008500170520108500255592002801340650001301368650001001381650000901391650001901400650001601419650001101435650002201446653002001468653002201488653002101510653001201531653001701543700001801560700001601578700001801594700001401612700001401626700002301640700001701663773011401680856008701794852000901881655001201890IND60730504120221119222822.0220606e20210830xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073050412DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2021.1294752doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBan, Xiaofeng14aThe desirable salt bridges in amylases: Distribution, configuration and location  aThe α-amylases are the most widely used industrial enzymes, and are particularly useful as liquifying enzymes in industrial processes based upon starch. Since starch liquefication is carried out at evaluated temperatures, typically above 60 °C, there is substantial demand for thermostable α -amylases. Most naturally occurring α -amylases exhibit moderate thermostability, so substantial effort has been invested in attempts to increase their thermostability. One structural feature that has the potential to increase protein thermostability is the introduction of salt bridges. However, not every salt bridge contributes to protein thermostability. The salt bridges in amylases have their characteristics in terms of distribution, configuration and location. The summary of these features helps to introduce new salt bridges based on the characteristics. This review focuses on salt bridges of α-amylases, both naturally present and introduced using mutagenesis. Its aim is to provide a bird’s eye view of distribution, configuration, location of desirable salt bridges.  aPublisher supplied data 3aamylases 3abirds 3aeyes 3afood chemistry 3amutagenesis 3astarch 3athermal stability 0aThermostability 0aIndustrial enzyme 0aEnzyme structure 0aAmylase 0aSalt bridges1 aXie, Xiaofang1 aLi, Caiming1 aGu, Zhengbiao1 aHong, Yan1 aCheng, Li1 aKaustubh, Bhalerao1 aLi, Zhaofeng0 tFood chemistry.g2021 Aug. 30, v. 354 p.129475-dElsevier LtdaElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl8139x0308-81467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2021.1294753Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03171naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002600092040001800118100001900136245009800155300001800253520213300271592002802404650001402432650001502446650001502461650001102476650000902487650002102496650001802517650000902535650001902544650001802563650001802581700001902599700002002618773011102638856003902749852000902788655001202797IND4466786120221120025055.0120727e20111115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446678612DNAL7 a10.1002/hyp.80812doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMa, Kuo‐Chen14aThe influence of water retention curve hysteresis on the stability of unsaturated soil slopes  ap. 3563-3574.  aHysteresis is a common feature exhibited in hydraulic properties of an unsaturated soil. The movement of wetting front and the hysteresis effect are important factors which impact the shear strength of the unsaturated soil and the mechanics of shallow landslides. These failures are mainly triggered by the deepening of the wetting front accompanied by a decrease in matric suction induced by infiltration. This research establishes a method for determining a stability analysis of unsaturated infinite soil slopes, integrating the influence of infiltration and the water retention curve hysteresis. Furthermore, the present stability analysis method including the infiltration model and the advanced Mohr–Coulomb failure criterion calculates the variations of the safety factor (FS) in accordance with different slope angle, depth and hydrological processes. The experimentally measured data on the effect of hysteresis are also carried out for comparison. Numerical analyses, employing both wetting and drying hydraulic behaviour of unsaturated soil, are performed to study the difference in soil‐water content as observed in the experiments. The simulating approximations also fully responded to the experimental data of sand box. The results suggest that the hysteresis behaviour affect the distribution of soil‐water content within the slope indeed. The hysteresis made the FS values a remarkable recovery during the period of non‐rainfall in a rainfall event. The appropriate hydraulic properties of soil (i.e. wetting or drying) should be used in accordance with the processes that unsaturated soil actually experience. This method will enable us to acquire more accurate matric suction head and the unsaturated soil‐shear strength as it changes with the hysteretic flow, in order to calculate into the stability analysis of shallow landslides. An advanced understanding of the process mechanism afforded by this method is critical to realizing a reliable and appropriate design for slope stabilization. It also offers some immediate reference information to the disaster reduction department of the government.  aPublisher supplied data 3adisasters 3ahysteresis 3alandslides 3amodels 3arain 3aresearch methods 3asafety factor 3asand 3ashear strength 3asoil strength 3awetting front1 aTan, Yih‐Chi1 aChen, Chu‐Hui0 tHydrological processes.g2011 Nov. 15, v. 25, no. 23 p.3563-3574dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.x0885-60877nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/hyp.8081  aDNAL 7aarticle02935naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100003100188245012900219300001200348506007600360520110500436592002801541506003701569650004401606650001701650650002201667650002101689650001201710650002001722650002801742650003301770650001701803650001101820650001301831650001301844650002501857650001701882650001501899650002101914650003301935650001901968650003001987650001602017650001402033700002402047700002902071700002402100700002402124700002502148773009402173856008102267852000902348655001202357IND60574654020221207115757.0170728e201707  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057465402DNAL7 a10.1007/s13205-017-0800-z2doi7 aPMC54894442pmcid7 a286604562pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKshirsagar, Siddheshwar D.10aSorghum husk biomass as a potential substrate for production of cellulolytic and xylanolytic enzymes by Nocardiopsis sp.

Expectedly, we observed that the temperature and pH of the environment play important roles in the performance of the nanogels. The nanogels were reduced in size upon increasing the temperature and showed higher volume phase transition temperature (VPTT) with higher concentration of HPMA. With the incorporation of ketal linkages, the nanogels showed accelerated degradation profiles by lowering the pH and increasing temperature of the incubation medium. When used as nanocarriers of anticancer drug doxorubicin (DOX), compared to non-degradable nanogels with similar components, the acid-degradable nanogels displayed more effective drug controlled release behaviour, low drug leakage of DOX at neutral pH while rapid and sufficient release from the nanogels under acidic conditions. The results of the cytotoxicity and hemolysis assays further highlighted that the acid-degradable nanogel produced no hemolysin but showed excellent viability to normal cells, and the DOX-loaded nanogel exhibited higher proliferation inhibition against tumor cells.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiocompatibility 3abiodegradability 3acytotoxicity 3adoxorubicin 3ahemolysins 3ahemolysis 3ananocarriers 3ananoparticles 3aneoplasm cells 3apH 3aphase transition 3apolymerization 3atemperature 3aviability1 aZheng, Jin1 aTian, Yefei1 aYang, Wuli0 tJournal of materials chemistry B.g2015 July 8, v. 3, no. 28 p.5824-5832dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26902x2050-75187nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c5tb00703h3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02126naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100003300143245012200176300001600298520073700314592002801051650001301079650002601092650001401118650002201132650001301154650001301167650001101180650001201191650001201203650001301215650001301228650001101241650002201252650001101274650000901285653002401294653002201318653001901340700002101359700001901380700002101399773015001420856007701570852000901647655001201656IND60522152520221119034734.0160601e20140602xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052215252DNAL7 a10.1515/znb-2000-06122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCastiñeiras, A.q(Alfonso),10aStructural and Spectral Studies of 2-Pyridineformamide Thiosemicarbazone and its Complexes Prepared with Zinc Halides  ap. 511-518.  aReduction of 2-cyanopyridine by sodium in dry methanol in presence of thiosemicarbazide produces 2-pyridineformamide thiosemicarbazone, HAm4DH.

Concern about the role of i.v. lipid emulsions in causing severe liver damage to high-risk infants receiving long-term i.v. nutrition has led to a variety of intervention strategies. These have had relatively limited success until the recent introduction of omega-3 (n–3) fatty acid-containing forms of lipid emulsions in place of the current omega-6 fatty acid-predominant lipid emulsions currently exclusively used in the United States. Preliminary data based on nonrandomized trials performed using compassionate-use protocols in the United States suggest very high rates of resolution of cholestasis with the use of an omega-3 fatty acid-predominant lipid emulsion. This result is supported by animal models of liver disease that demonstrate decreased liver damage when animals are provided omega-3 fatty acid-containing lipid emulsions compared with those primarily omega-6 fatty acid based. However, human trials are limited at this time and further research is needed to establish the best approach to preventing liver damage in infants receiving i.v. nutrition and the optimal dose and timing of intervention with novel lipid emulsions.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aanimal models 3acholestasis 3aemulsions 3afatty acids 3ahumans 3ainfants 3aliver 3aliver diseases 3aoptimal nutrition 3apremature birth 3atherapeutics 3aUnited States0 tAdvances in nutrition.g2013 Sept., v. 4, no. 5 p.518-520dAmerican Society for Clinical NutritionwJournal:2280x2156-53767nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3945/an.113.0040693Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/ARS  aDNAL 7aarticle03485naa a2200625 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003700092040001800129100002000147245010700167300001400274520170600288592002801994650001502022650001102037650001702048650002302065650002502088650001602113650001702129650002702146650001402173650002502187650001102212650002002223650001102243650001102254650002102265650001702286650001302303650001502316650002202331650001802353650001502371650001702386650001002403700001802413700001702431700001702448700001702465700002202482700002402504700001702528700002102545700003002566700002202596700002202618700002102640773009402661856008302755852000902838655001202847IND4475586220221117182029.0150812e201211  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447558622DNAL7 a10.1016/j.agwat.2012.06.0272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDiaz-Espejo, A.10aSteps toward an improvement in process-based models of water use by fruit trees: A case study in olive  ap. 37-49.  aWe applied two process-based models in a hedgerow olive orchard with the aim of understanding the limitations and mechanisms behind the control of transpiration in olive trees under drip irrigation. One model is based on the biophysics of water flow through the porous media of soil and xylem. The other is a hydromechanical model based on the observed dependence of stomatal aperture on whole-plant and epidermis water relations. The experiments were made in a hedgerow olive orchard (1667treesha⁻¹) planted with 5-year-old ‘Arbequina’ trees. Measurements were made in control trees irrigated to replace 100% of the crop water needs, and in trees under regulated deficit irrigation (RDI) strategy, in which irrigation replaced ca. 30% of the control. Soil physical properties, root distribution, leaf area, sap flow, leaf osmotic pressure and key variables of leaf gas exchange and water status were measured and models were applied. Results show how in our orchard, with a shallow root distribution and very coarse soil, most of the limitation to transpiration was imposed by the hydraulics of the rhizosphere. The model shows how this limitation was related to the ratio of root to leaf area, and how this ratio can be managed by canopy pruning or by changing the number of drippers. Likewise, osmotic adjustment occurred similarly in both irrigation treatments, despite differences found on leaf water potential. Water stress largely affected plant hydraulic conductivity of RDI trees. A potential involvement of regulating signals, other than purely hydraulics, was evident in both treatments, although our data suggests that these signals were not regulated by the soil water status only.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiophysics 3acanopy 3acase studies 3adeficit irrigation 3aemitters (equipment) 3afruit trees 3agas exchange 3ahydraulic conductivity 3aleaf area 3aleaf water potential 3aleaves 3amicroirrigation 3amodels 3aolives 3aosmotic pressure 3aporous media 3asap flow 3asoil water 3astomatal movement 3atranspiration 3awater flow 3awater stress 3axylem1 aBuckley, T.N.1 aSperry, J.S.1 aCuevas, M.V.1 ade Cires, A.1 aElsayed-Farag, S.1 aMartin-Palomo, M.J.1 aMuriel, J.L.1 aPerez-Martin, A.1 aRodriguez-Dominguez, C.M.1 aRubio-Casal, A.E.1 aTorres-Ruiz, J.M.1 aFernández, J.E.0 tAgricultural water management.g2012 Nov., v. 114 p.37-49dElsevier B.V.x0378-37747nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agwat.2012.06.0273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02489naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100003000152245012400182520101100306592002801317650001701345650002201362650001301384650001401397650001001411650001901421650001101440650003201451650002101483650001001504653002401514653000901538653001601547653003201563653001901595653001401614653002201628653002601650700001901676700002201695700002001717700002301737700001801760700002101778773010001799856008701899852000901986655001201995IND60730504320221119222636.0220606e20210830xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073050432DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2021.1294772doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aApolinar-Valiente, Rafael10aAcacia gums new fractions and sparkling base wines: How their biochemical and structural properties impact foamability?  aFoam is the first attribute observed when sparkling wine is served. Bentonite is essentially used to flocculate particles in sparkling base wines but can impair their foamability. Gums from Acacia senegal and Acacia seyal improved the foamability of different bentonite-treated base wines. Our main goal was to see how the supplementation with new fractions separated from Acacia gums by Ion Exchange Chromatography affected foamability of sparkling base wines, deepening the relation between foam behavior and characteristics of wine and gums. High molar mass fractions increased the maximal foam height and the foam height during the stability period in, respectively, 11 out and 8 out of 16 cases (69% and 50%, respectively). The properties of the supplementing gums fractions obtained by IEC and, although to a minor extent, the wine characteristics, affected positively and/or negatively the foam behavior. Wine foamability also depended on the relationship between wine and gums fractions properties.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAcacia seyal 3aSenegalia senegal 3abehavior 3abentonite 3afoams 3afood chemistry 3aheight 3aion exchange chromatography 3amolecular weight 3awines 0aSparkling base wine 0aFoam 0aAcacia gums 0aIon exchange chromatography 0aMacromolecules 0aSEC-MALLS 0aHydrophobic score 0aVolumetric properties1 aSalmon, Thomas1 aWilliams, Pascale1 aNigen, Michaël1 aSanchez, Christian1 aDoco, Thierry1 aMarchal, Richard0 tFood chemistry.g2021 Aug. 30, v. 354 p.129477-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl8139x0308-81467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2021.1294773Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03973naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100006100139245017200200300001800372500002000390520204900410592002802459596005202487596005902539650001802598650001702616650002402633650002602657650002202683650001502705650000902720650002102729650001502750650001002765650001302775650001702788650002602805650001802831651002202849651001802871700005202889700006102941700005903002700006303061700006103124700005803185773013003243856007303373852000903446655001203455IND60752142920221119232955.0210929e202110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075214292DNAL7 a10.1111/ddi.132532doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEuclide, Peter T.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1212-043510aEnvironmental DNA metabarcoding as a tool for biodiversity assessment and monitoring: reconstructing established fish communities of north‐temperate lakes and rivers  ap. 1966-1980.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aAIM: To evaluate the ability of precipitation‐based environmental DNA (eDNA) sample collection and mitochondrial 12S metabarcoding sequencing to reconstruct well‐studied fish communities in lakes and rivers. Specific objectives were to 1) determine correlations between eDNA species detections and known community composition based on conventional field sampling, 2) compare efficiency of eDNA to detect fish biodiversity among systems with variable morphologies and trophic states, and 3) determine if species habitat preferences predict eDNA detection. LOCATION: Upper Great Lakes Region, North America. METHODS: Fish community composition was estimated for seven lakes and two Mississippi River navigation pools using sequence data from the mitochondrial 12S gene amplified from 10 to 50 water samples per waterbody collected in 50‐mL centrifuge tubes at a single time point. Environmental DNA (eDNA) was concentrated without filtration by centrifuging samples to reduce per‐sample handling time. Taxonomic detections from eDNA were compared to established community monitoring databases containing up to 40 years of sampling and a detailed habitat/substrate preference matrix to identify patterns of bias. RESULTS: Mitochondrial 12S gene metabarcoding detected 15%–47% of the known species at each waterbody and 30%–76% of known genera. Non‐metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) assessment of the community structure indicated that eDNA‐detected communities grouped in a similar pattern as known communities. Discriminant analysis of principal components indicated that there was a high degree of overlap in habitat/substrate preference of eDNA‐detected and eDNA‐undetected species suggesting limited habitat bias for eDNA sampling. MAIN CONCLUSIONS: Large numbers of small volume samples sequenced at the mitochondrial 12S gene can describe the coarse community structure of freshwater systems. However, additional conventional sampling and environmental DNA sampling may be necessary for a complete diversity census.  aPublisher supplied data  cU.S. Geological Survey Invasive Species Program  cResearch Computing Clusters at Old Dominion University 3aDNA barcoding 3abiodiversity 3acommunity structure 3adiscriminant analysis 3aenvironmental DNA 3afiltration 3afish 3afish communities 3afreshwater 3agenes 3ahabitats 3amitochondria 3asubstrate specificity 3asurface water 3aMississippi River 3aNorth America1 aLor, Yer1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5738-24121 aSpear, Michael J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1365-35831 aTajjioui, Tariq1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0113-04511 aVander Zanden, Jake1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8122-14161 aLarson, Wesley A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4473-34011 aAmberg, Jon J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8351-48610 tDiversity & distributions.g2021 Oct., v. 27, no. 10 p.1966-1980dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3867071x1366-95167nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ddi.132533Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01941naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002600143245021300169300001600382520076900398592002801167650001601195650002301211650002301234650001201257653002301269653001701292653002901309700001701338700002401355773015001379856007701529852000901606655001201615IND60522152620221119034719.0160601e20140602xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052215262DNAL7 a10.1515/znb-2000-06132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBreitsameter, Florian14aDie Kondensation von Ylidylchlorphosphanen mit Phosphanen und Bis(diphenylphosphanyl)methan und -amin / The Condensation of Ylidyl Chlorophosphines with Phosphines and Bis(diphenylphosphino)methane and -amine  ap. 519-526.  aYlidyl chlorophosphanes 1 and dichlorophosphanes 2 react with trimethylsilyl phosphanes to yield the ylidyl diphosphanes 3, 4,5, 7 and the 2-ylidyl triphosphanes 8.

So far, five genotype groups of this pathogen have been identified by applying random amplified polymorphic DNA analysis on axenic cultures. To allow genotyping of A. astaci in host tissue samples, we have developed co-dominant microsatellite markers for this pathogen, tested them on pure cultures of all genotype groups, and subsequently evaluated their use on tissues of (1) natural A. astaci carriers, i.e., North American crayfish species, and (2) A. astaci-infected indigenous European species from crayfish plague outbreaks. Out of over 200 potential loci containing simple sequence repeat (SSR) motifs identified by 454 pyrosequencing of SSR-enriched library, we tested 25 loci with highest number of repeats, and finally selected nine that allow unambiguous separation of all known RAPD-defined genotype groups of A. astaci from axenic cultures. Using these markers, we were able to characterize A. astaci strains from DNA isolates from infected crayfish tissues when crayfish had a moderate to high agent level according to quantitative PCR analyses. The results support the hypothesis that different North American crayfish hosts carry different genotype groups of the pathogen, and confirm that multiple genotype groups, including the one originally introduced to Europe in the 19th century, cause crayfish plague outbreaks in Central Europe. So far undocumented A. astaci genotype seems to have caused one of the analysed outbreaks from the Czech Republic.

The interval was a period of relatively low trophic state. Natural factors were the main controls on environmental changes in and around the lake. (2) Stage II (1800s–1970s, 35–15 cm sediment depth) was a period when human activities began to exert influence on the environment in and around the lake. Enhanced agricultural exploitation and greater regional rainfall resulted in delivery to the lake of more land-derived lipids. Logging activity around the lake altered the vegetation, as revealed by shifts in C₂₇/C₃₃ ratios and the average chain length (ACL₂₇₋₃₃). A significant decline in lake level caused by excessive water consumption impacted aquatic macrophytes, as revealed by a reduction in macrophyte indicators. Lower nutrient concentrations were inferred for this period. (3) Stage III (1980s–present, 14–0 cm sediment depth) corresponds to a period of accelerating eutrophication. Before year 2000, lake level declined steadily as a result of low rainfall (drought) and high evaporation, which exerted a strong influence on the lake condition. In addition, anthropogenic activities contributed to lake eutrophication. After 2000, the lake experienced a dramatic increase in trophic state, characterized by high algal productivity, as indicated by greater TN, short-chain n-ALKs and short-chain n-FAs. The change was probably caused by flourishing tourism around the lake. In summary, environmental changes in and around Lake Issyk-Kul during the past ∼300 years were originally driven largely by natural factors such as shifts in regional precipitation amount. Human activities (e.g. logging, agriculture, water extraction, and more recently, tourism) took on increasingly important roles during the last two centuries, affecting watershed vegetation, the lake primary producer community and lake trophic status. Changes recorded in the lake sediments over the last ∼300 years are in good agreement with historical records.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgae 3aalkanes 3abiomarkers 3adrought 3aeutrophication 3aevaporation 3ahumans 3ahydrology 3alakes 3alipids 3amacrophytes 3arain 3asediments 3atotal nitrogen 3atotal organic carbon 3atourism 3avegetation 3awatersheds 3aCentral Asia 0aEnvironmental changes 0aLipid biomarkers 0aSediment core 0aAnthropogenic activities 0aLake Issyk-Kul1 aWu, Jinglu1 aLi, Qianyu1 aJin, Miao0 tLimnologica.g2021 Sept., v. 90 p.125909-dElsevier GmbHwJournal:1974x0075-95117nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.limno.2021.1259093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02586naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002200150245017500172300001600347520121900363592002801582650002601610650001401636650001101650650001001661650001001671650003101681650004301712650001501755650001401770650003501784650001001819653002501829653002201854653001001876700002001886700002101906700002401927773011901951856008502070852000902155655001202164IND60535219820221122042218.0190403e20140604xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053521982DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vetmic.2014.02.0222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPetersen, Andreas10aMLST typing of Pasteurella multocida associated with haemorrhagic septicaemia and development of a real-time PCR specific for haemorrhagic septicaemia associated isolates  ap. 335-341.  aTwo serovars of Pasteurella multocida, B:2 and E:2, have been reportedly associated with haemorrhagic septicaemia (HS), a peracute and devastating disease mainly affecting cattle and water buffaloes. We multilocus sequence typed (MLST) 64 isolates of P. multocida including 55 associated with HS and found that they mainly included sequence type (ST) 122 (n=50) and rarely ST63 (n=1), ST147 (n=2) and ST162 (n=2) compared to other members of the species isolated from other lesion types and hosts. Single-nucleotide polymorphisms suitable for specific detection of STs associated with HS were detected in the est gene. A new HS-est-RT-PCR (est indicating the target gene) specifically detected ST122, ST63, ST147 and ST162 associated with HS. The new HS-est-RT-PCR did not detect strains of ST151 with capsular type D isolated from pigs that were found positive with a previously published HS PCR detection method. The new HS-est-RT-PCR represents a fast and specific detection of the specific types of P. multocida involved in HS. The HS-est-RT-PCR developed in the current study seems to more accurately identify isolates of P. multocida associated with HS compared to PCR detection methods previously published.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPasteurella multocida 3abuffaloes 3acattle 3agenes 3ahosts 3amultilocus sequence typing 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3asepticemia 3aserotypes 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism 3aswine 0aClonal complex ST122 0aAcute septicaemia 0aRirdc1 aBisgaard, Magne1 aTownsend, Kirsty1 aChristensen, Henrik0 tVeterinary microbiology.g2014 June 04, v. 170, no. 3-4 p.335-341dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl8205x0378-11357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vetmic.2014.02.0223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02941naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002100144245010400165300001600269520128300285592002801568650001901596650002401615650002101639650001101660650001201671650001701683650001801700650001001718650001301728650001801741650001601759650002601775650002001801650001801821650001801839650001701857650001901874650002501893653003201918653001201950653002401962653001101986653002301997700002402020700002102044700001902065700001902084700002302103700002002126700001802146773011102164856007902275852000902354655001202363IND60595009820221119232647.0190405e20180423xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059500982DNAL7 a10.1515/biol-2018-00172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKushkevych, Ivan12aA new combination of substrates: biogas production and diversity of the methanogenic microorganisms  ap. 119-128.  aAgriculture, food industry, and manufacturing are just some of the areas where anaerobic technology can be used. Currently, anaerobic technologies are mainly used for wastewater treatment, solid waste treatment, or for the production of electrical and thermal energy from energy crops processing. However, a clear trend is towards more intensive use of this technology in biomass and biodegradable waste processing and hydrogen or biomethane production. An enormous number of anaerobic digesters are operating worldwide but there is very little information about the effect of different substrate combinations on the methanogens community. This is due to the fact that each of the anaerobic digesters has its own unique microbial community. For the most effective management of anaerobic processes it would be important to know the composition of a consortium of anaerobic microorganisms present in anaerobic digesters processing different input combinations of raw material. This paper characterizes the effect of the input raw materials on the diversity of the methanogen community. Two predominant microorganisms in anaerobic digesters were found to be 99% identity by the sequences of the 16S rRNA gene to the Methanoculleus and Thermogymnomonas genera deposited in GenBank.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMethanoculleus 3aanaerobic digesters 3abiodegradability 3abiogas 3abiomass 3aenergy crops 3afood industry 3agenes 3ahydrogen 3amanufacturing 3amethanogens 3amicrobial communities 3anew combination 3araw materials 3aribosomal RNA 3asolid wastes 3athermal energy 3awastewater treatment 0amethanogenic microorganisms 0aArchaea 0aanaerobic digesters 0abiogas 0amethane production1 aVítězová, Monika1 aVítěz, Tomáš1 aKováč, Jozef1 aKaucká, Petra1 aJesionek, Wojciech1 aBartoš, Milan,1 aBarton, Larry0 tOpen life sciences.g2018 Apr. 23, v. 13, no. 1 p.119-128dDe Gruyter OpenwJournal:23145x2391-54127nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1515/biol-2018-00173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03433naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001500149245007900164520191100243592002802154650001602182650001702198650001202215650002402227650001902251650002102270650001002291650001602301650001802317650001402335650001502349650001202364650001202376650001802388651001202406653001702418653002402435653002002459700005902479700005902538700002102597700005702618700002202675700005702697773009202754856008402846852000902930655001202939IND60747141220221120224019.0210904e202109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074714122DNAL7 a10.1016/j.limno.2021.1259102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSwe, Thida14aThe importance of aquatic macrophytes in a eutrophic tropical shallow lake  aInlay Lake is the second largest natural lake in Myanmar. Located in Shan State, in the eastern part of the country, it is a known biodiversity hotspot. The lake is negatively affected by an increasing local human population and rapid growth in both agriculture and tourism. In recent decades, several studies have listed faunistic and floristic groups in Inlay Lake, but there is still a general lack of knowledge about the aquatic macrophyte and phytoplankton community composition and abundance, and their interactions. To fill this knowledge gap, field surveys of biological and physical and chemical parameters were carried out in the period 2014–2017. They show that Inlay Lake is a shallow, clear water and calcareous lake, with nutrient concentrations indicating mesotrophic-eutrophic conditions. However, close to the shore, nutrient concentrations are generally higher, reflecting pollution from inflowing rivers, shoreline villages and floating gardens. Both the richness and abundance of aquatic macrophytes in Inlay Lake were high, with several species forming extensive stands in most of the lake over the whole survey period. Total phytoplankton and cyanobacterial biomass were low, but cyanobacteria included toxin-producing strains of Microcystis, suggesting that cyanobacterial and total phytoplankton biomass need to be kept low to avoid potentially harmful cyanobacterial blooms. Submerged macrophyte abundance and phytoplankton biomass were inversely correlated in the heavily vegetated northern lake area. Our survey suggests a great importance of the submerged macrophytes to the general water quality and the clear water state in Inlay Lake. Maintaining high macrophyte abundances should therefore be a goal in management strategies, both for Inlay Lake and other lakes in Myanmar. It is highly desirable to include macrophytes and phytoplankton in the lake monitoring in Myanmar.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMicrocystis 3abiodiversity 3abiomass 3acommunity structure 3aeutrophication 3ahuman population 3alakes 3amacrophytes 3aphytoplankton 3apollution 3ashorelines 3asurveys 3atourism 3awater quality 3aMyanmar 0aLake ecology 0aBiotic interactions 0aLake management1 aLombardo, Paola1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0058-76921 aBallot, Andreas1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4088-06771 aThrane, Jan-Erik1 aSample, James1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0861-39821 aEriksen, Tor Erik1 aMjelde, Marit1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0083-31010 tLimnologica.g2021 Sept., v. 90 p.125910-dElsevier GmbHwJournal:1974x0075-95117nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.limno.2021.1259103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02692naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245013900159300001800298520138100316592002801697650002801725650001301753650002001766650001701786650001001803650001801813650001301831650001901844650001301863650001801876650001401894650001501908650002601923650001401949700002101963700001801984700001302002700001802015773014202033856007402175852000902249655001202258IND60671270220221123044048.0191002e20150729xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067127022DNAL7 a10.1039/c5tb00715a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Ai-Zheng10aPreparation and antitumor effect evaluation of composite microparticles co-loaded with siRNA and paclitaxel by a supercritical process  ap. 6439-6447.  aThe co-delivery of siRNA and therapeutic agents provides an effective method for cancer chemotherapy by avoiding drug resistance during the treatment. With a combination of ionic gelation and supercritical fluid technology, nanoparticle-embedded composite microparticles (CMPs) co-loaded with siRNA and paclitaxel (siRNA-PTX-CMPs) were successfully prepared. The results show that CMPs embedded with nanoparticles with a diameter of 50–100 nm exhibited a spherical shape and core–shell structure with a mean diameter of 323 nm. The encapsulation efficiency of siRNA in chitosan nanoparticles (CS NPs) was 96.97%. The drug load and encapsulation efficiency of PTX-loaded CMPs (5% dosage) were 1.40% and 27.95%, respectively; both these increased with an increase in dosage. It was found that no change had occurred in the functional groups of the components during the supercritical process, while the physical form of PTX had shifted to an amorphous state. In the cell experiments, the CMPs clustered around the nucleus after being taken up by the Bcap-37 cells. The results of the antitumor effect experiments revealed that the co-loaded siRNA-PTX-CMPs achieved a significantly better synergistic effect than single dosages, which indicated that the co-delivery system developed by the supercritical process could have potential in the application of cancer chemotherapy.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantineoplastic activity 3achitosan 3adrug resistance 3adrug therapy 3adrugs 3aencapsulation 3agelation 3amicroparticles 3amoieties 3ananoparticles 3aneoplasms 3apaclitaxel 3asmall interfering RNA 3asynergism1 aKang, Yong-Qiang1 aWang, Shi-Bin1 aTang, Na1 aSu, Xiao-Qian0 tJournal of materials chemistry B.g2015 July 29, v. 3, no. 31 p.6439-6447dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26902x2050-75187nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c5tb00715a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01712naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001800143245014800161300001200309520060100321592002800922650002200950650001700972650001100989650001201000650001401012650001201026650001401038650002201052650001301074653003101087700002101118773013701139856007701276852000901353655001201362IND60522153120221119034813.0160601e20140602xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052215312DNAL7 a10.1515/znb-2000-06182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRabe, Susanne10aZu Strängen assoziierte Ionen [AsCl4· AsCl3]- im [Mg(NCCH3)6][As4Cl14] / Strands of Associated [AsCl4· AsCl3]- Ions in [Mg(NCCH3)6][As4Cl14]  ap. 553.  aThe reaction of arsenic, MgSO₄ and S₂Cl₂ in acetonitrile yielded the title compound along with 4,5- dichloro-1 ,2,3-dithiazolium chloride, [C₂NS₂Cl₂]Cl (which was formed from the solvent and S₂Cl₂).

From 2010 to 2011, 30 mink P. aeruginosa isolates were identified from lung, fecal and feed samples of clinical cases and subjected to serotyping, antimicrobial susceptibility testing and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) using SpeI. The P. aeruginosa isolates belonged to four serotypes—21 of type G, four of type I, three of type M, one of type B, and one non-typable strain. The strains were divided into four large groups as determined by PFGE. Isolates from the group 2 were highly homologous and were obtained from the same region as an epidemic. All of the isolates were sensitive to piperacillin, piperacillin/tazobactam, ceftazidime, cefepime, imipenem, amikacin, gentamicin and tobramycin and resistant to ampicillin, cefuroxime and cefuroxime axetil. A high frequency of resistance was found to ampicillin/sulbactam, cefazolin, cefotetan, ceftriaxone, nitrofurantoin, and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (96.7%). Resistance to ticarcillin/clavulanic acid, ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin was less common (13.3%). There was no relationship between antibiotic resistance and serotype distribution of the isolates. The epidemic serotype of P. aeruginosa from the mink hemorrhagic pneumonia in Shandong province was type G, which was a clone of commonly found in this province. These findings reveal the genetic similarities and antimicrobial susceptibility profiles of P. aeruginosa from clinical cases of mink hemorrhagic pneumonia and will facilitate the prevention and control of the disease in Shandong province of China.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPseudomonas aeruginosa 3aamikacin 3aantibiotic resistance 3acefazolin 3acefotetan 3aceftazidime 3aceftriaxone 3acefuroxime 3aciprofloxacin 3aclavulanic acid 3adisease control 3agenetic similarity 3agentamicin 3aimipenem 3alevofloxacin 3amink 3amolecular epidemiology 3anitrofurantoin 3apiperacillin 3apneumonia 3apulsed-field gel electrophoresis 3aserotypes 3asulbactam 3asulfamethoxazole 3aticarcillin 3atobramycin 3atrimethoprim 3aChina 0aMink 0aPseudomonas aeruginosa 0aIdentification 0aSerotyping 0aAntimicrobial susceptibility 0aPulsed-field gel electrophoresis1 aLi, Lulu1 aDu, Yijun1 aWang, Shourong1 aZhi'an,1 aLuo, Yanbo1 aChe, Jie1 aLu, Jinxing1 aLiu, Hui1 aHu, Guangchun1 aLi, Jixia1 aGong, Yanwen1 aWang, Guisheng1 aHu, Ming1 aShiganYan, 1 aLiu, Yuqing0 tVeterinary microbiology.g2014 June 04, v. 170, no. 3-4 p.456-461dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl8205x0378-11357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vetmic.2014.02.0253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02719naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100006000139245009500199300001800294500001100312520138100323592002801704650001801732650001901750650001501769650001201784650001701796650001001813650001901823650002001842650002201862650002201884650001901906650002301925700002001948700002301968700002101991700002002012700002102032773015002053856007302203852000902276655001202285IND60603332120221117071838.0180713e201808  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060333212DNAL7 a10.1002/jsfa.89452doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLamas, Alexandre1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7283-937210aSalmonella and Campylobacter biofilm formation: a comparative assessment from farm to fork  ap. 4014-4032.  aREVIEW  aIt takes several steps to bring food from the farm to the fork (dining table), and contamination with food‐borne pathogens can occur at any point in the process. Campylobacter spp. and Salmonella spp. are the main microorganisms responsible for foodborne disease in the EU. These two pathogens are able to persist throughout the food supply chain thanks to their ability to form biofilms. Owing to the high prevalence of Salmonella and especially of Campylobacter in the food supply chain and the huge efforts of food authorities to reduce these levels, it is of great importance to fully understand their mechanisms of persistence. Diverse studies have evaluated the biofilm‐forming capacity of foodborne pathogens isolated at different steps of food production. Nonetheless, the principal obstacle of these studies is to reproduce the real conditions that microorganisms encounter in the food supply chain. While there are a wide number of Salmonella biofilm studies, information on Campylobacter biofilms is still limited. A comparison between the two microorganisms could help to develop new research in the field of Campylobacter biofilms. Therefore, this review evaluates relevant work in the field of Salmonella and Campylobacter biofilms and the applicability of the data obtained from these studies to real working conditions. © 2018 Society of Chemical Industry  aPublisher supplied data 3aCampylobacter 3aEuropean Union 3aSalmonella 3abiofilm 3afarm to fork 3afarms 3afood pathogens 3afood production 3afood supply chain 3afoodborne illness 3amicroorganisms 3aworking conditions1 aRegal, Patricia1 aVázquez, Beatriz,1 aMiranda, José M1 aCepeda, Alberto1 aFranco, Carlos M0 tJournal of the science of food and agriculture.g2018 Aug., v. 98, no. 11 p.4014-4032dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.wJournal:jnl48536x0022-51427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jsfa.89453Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02029naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002200148245009600170300001300266520097000279592002801249650001101277650001501288650001701303650001301320650001401333650001401347650002101361650001301382650001401395650002101409651002101430700001901451773010601470856008201576852000901658655001201667IND60621477220221121034547.0181117e199409  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062147722DNAL7 a10.1177/1564826594015003052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHeywood, Peter F.10aNutritional Effects of Export-Crop Production in Papua New Guinea: A Review of the Evidence  ap. 1-17.  aThe effects of cash cropping on nutrition in Papua New Guinea are reviewed. The interpretation of the available evidence is complicated by the introduction of cash cropping simultaneously with services such as health and education of the rural population. However, there is indication that the growth of children improved over the period in which cash cropping increased, particularly in the highlands, where, as a result of the later introduction of cash crops, more baseline data are available. There is no reason to believe that the same effect did not occur in the lowlands, where the infant mortality rate fell progressively over the same period. There is also evidence of an increase in the height and weight of adults, as well as an increase in the prevalence of degenerative diseases. Programmes need to be developed that retain the important benefits of child health and at the same time arrest the increasing prevalence of degenerative diseases in adults.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadults 3acash crops 3achild health 3achildren 3aeducation 3ahighlands 3ainfant mortality 3alowlands 3anutrition 3arural population 3aPapua New Guinea1 aHide, Robin L.0 tFood and nutrition bulletin.g, v. 15, no. 3 p.1-17dSAGE PublicationswJournal:2034x0379-57217nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1564826594015003053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02754naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001900152245010900171300001400280520148800294592002801782650002901810650001001839650001601849650002001865650001701885650001801902650002001920650002001940650001601960653002101976653001601997653001402013653002702027653002902054653001702083700001702100700002302117773009602140856008702236852000902323655001202332IND60541241520221119053901.0190318e201504  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054124152DNAL7 a10.1016/j.plantsci.2014.12.0182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKabbage, Mehdi10aPathogenic attributes of Sclerotinia sclerotiorum: Switching from a biotrophic to necrotrophic lifestyle  ap. 53-60.  aPlants and fungi have had many years of friendly and not-so friendly competition for resources and quality of life. As a result, diverse pathosystems evolved numerous strategies, coupled with the emergence of multifaceted pathogenic and saprophytic lifestyles. We discuss fungal lifestyle classifications and how the views associated with certain fungal pathogens, particularly necrotophs, are changing as we learn more about the complexities of their interactions with a given host plant. We discuss the physiological events leading to the transition from biotrophy to necrotrophy in hemi-biotrophs, and conclude that both the control of plant immune responses and the need for a more efficient mode of nutrient acquisition are possible triggers for the transition to necrotrophy. Based on recent findings, we focus on the polyphagous plant pathogen Sclerotinia sclerotiorum. Rather than overwhelming plant foes, S. sclerotiorum has evolved clever means to compromise host recognition and establish disease, resulting in a broad and immensely successful pathogenic lifestyle. The tactics used by this fungus to achieve pathogenic success are being clarified. We propose that the hemi-biotrophic lifestyle may be more temporally and spatially complex than currently depicted, and that combining lifestyle attributes with damage response curves that consider the contribution of both the fungus and the host to pathogenesis, may provide a more holistic manner to view plant pathogens.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSclerotinia sclerotiorum 3afungi 3ahost plants 3aimmune response 3apathogenesis 3apathogenicity 3aplant pathogens 3aquality of life 3asaprophytes 0aFungal pathogens 0aNecrotrophy 0aBiotrophy 0aLifestyle designations 0aSclerotinia sclerotiorum 0aDamage curve1 aYarden, Oded1 aDickman, Martin B.0 tPlant science.g2015 Apr., v. 233 p.53-60dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl38764x0168-94527nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.plantsci.2014.12.0183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03217naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100005700142245012200199500002000321520154000341592002801881596006401909596009401973596006602067596006602133596006602199596006602265596006602331650001002397650001502407650002002422650001202442650001502454650003102469650001302500650001502513700005802528773013502586856007702721852000902798655001202807IND60778449620221120212818.0220527e202205  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077844962DNAL7 a10.1029/2021JB0232582doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYano, Keisuke1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2306-045510al1 Trend Filtering‐Based Detection of Short‐Term Slow Slip Events: Application to a GNSS Array in Southwest Japan  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe discovery of slow slip events (SSEs) based on the installation of dense geodetic observation networks has provided important clues to understanding the process of stress release and accumulation in subduction zones. Because SSEs with durations of days to weeks do not often result in sufficient displacements that can be visually inspected, refined automated detection methods are required to understand the occurrence of SSEs. In this study, we propose a new method based on which SSEs can be detected in observations derived by a Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) array by using l₁ trend filtering, a variation of sparse estimation, in conjunction with combined p $p$‐value techniques. The sparse estimation technique and data‐driven determination of hyperparameters are utilized in the proposed method to identify candidates of the event onsets. In addition, combined p $p$‐value techniques are used to provide confidence values for the detections. The synthetic test demonstrated that the new method can detect 22 events of total 23 events and has only 1% false detections with the detection threshold 68%. The proposed method was then applied to daily displacements obtained at 39 GNSS stations in the Nankai subduction zone in western Shikoku, Southwest Japan. The results revealed that, in addition to all known events, new 12 events can be detected with the proposed method. Finally, we found the number of low‐frequency earthquakes in the target region increased around at the onsets of potential events.  aPublisher supplied data  aJPMJCR1763cMEXT, Japan Science and Technology Agency (JST)  aJPJ010217cMEXT Project for Seismology toward Research Innovation with Data of Earthquake  aJP21H05205cJapan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS)  aJP21H05206cJapan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS)  aJP18K03796cJapan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS)  aJP21K03694cJapan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS)  aJP19K20222cJapan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS) 3aJapan 3aautomation 3adetection limit 3ageodesy 3ageophysics 3aglobal positioning systems 3aresearch 3asubduction1 aKano, Masayuki1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7288-47600 tJournal of geophysical research.g2022 May, v. 127, no. 5 p.e2021JB023258-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:27943x2169-93137nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2021JB0232583Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03776naa a2200637 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100003200151245018900183300001600372520140400388536021101792592002802003596011202031650003402143650002502177650002102202650002802223650002602251650002902277650002502306650001002331650002502341650001802366650001602384650001702400650002202417650002102439650002302460650001102483650000702494650001302501650002502514650001802539650002402557650001702581650001902598650002402617650002002641653004002661653002502701653001302726653001602739700002602755700002802781700004002809700002402849700002102873773013802894856008503032852000903117655001203126IND60654113620221123012018.0190722e20190703xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065411362DNAL7 a10.1080/10498850.2019.16281522doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDe Quadros, Camila Da Costa10aEvaluation of the Antioxidant and Antimicrobial Activity of Protein Hydrolysates and Peptide Fractions Derived from Colossoma macropomum and Their Effect on Ground Beef Lipid Oxidation  ap. 677-688.  aThe objective of this study was to obtain protein hydrolysate from the mechanically separated meat of blackfin pacu to evaluate the influence by ultrafiltration in the antioxidant and antimicrobial activities of the peptide fractions obtained and to apply in ground beef to evaluate the lipid stability. The enzymatic hydrolysis was performed using the enzyme Protamex (pH 7.0, 60°C) for 240 min. The protein hydrolysate was fractionated by ultrafiltration. Then, the antioxidant capacity of the protein hydrolysate and the peptide fractions were evaluated in vitro by the methods of 2,2’-azinobis (3-ethylbenzothiazoline sulfonic acid) radical capture, 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl radical-scavenging assay, reducing power, and hydroxyl radical scavenging activity. The antimicrobial activity of the samples was evaluated by disc-diffusion against Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli. After evaluation, the peptide fractions did not present higher bioactivities than that shown for the hydrolysate. The protein hydrolysate was applied to ground beef, where the substances reactive to thiobarbituric acid and color were evaluated during 7 days of storage at 4°C. Lipid oxidation was reduced up to 60.9% and there was no modification of the natural coloration. Thus, the protein hydrolysate can be used as an alternative source of antioxidant for the preservation of refrigerated meats.  aThis work was supported by the Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico; Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior; Empresa Brasileira de Pesquisa Agropecuária.  aPublisher supplied data  a001cCoordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superiordhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100002322 3a2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl 3aColossoma macropomum 3aEscherichia coli 3aPiaractus mesopotamicus 3aStaphylococcus aureus 3aantimicrobial properties 3aantioxidant activity 3acolor 3aenzymatic hydrolysis 3afractionation 3aground beef 3ahydrolysates 3ahydroxyl radicals 3ain vitro studies 3alipid peroxidation 3alipids 3apH 3apeptides 3aprotein hydrolysates 3arefrigeration 3astorage temperature 3astorage time 3asulfonic acids 3athiobarbituric acid 3aultrafiltration 0aMechanically separated meat of fish 0aenzymatic hydrolysis 0aProtamex 0abioactivity1 aLima, Karina Oliveira1 aBueno, Caio Hendrix Luz1 aFogaça, Fabíola Helena dos Santos1 aDa Rocha, Meritaine1 aPrentice, Carlos0 tJournal of aquatic food product technology.g2019 July 3, v. 28, no. 6 p.677-688dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl47704x1547-06367nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10498850.2019.16281523Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01671naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245013500158520059900293592002800892650001700920650001900937651002100956700001900977700001900996700001801015700002001033700001901053700002001072700001501092700001501107773012701122856007501249852000901324655001201333IND60754282820221120154243.0211023e20211014xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075428282DNAL7 a10.3390/md191005752doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhou, Luning 10aSaliniquinone Derivatives, Saliniquinones G−I and Heraclemycin E, from the Marine Animal-Derived Nocardiopsis aegyptia HDN19-252  aFour new anthraquinone derivatives, namely saliniquinones G−I (1–3) and heraclemycin E (4), were obtained from the Antarctic marine-derived actinomycete Nocardiopsis aegyptia HDN19-252, guided by the Global Natural Products Social (GNPS) molecular networking platform.

Then the proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) and continuous wavelet transform are developed to reveal the particle fluctuation velocities in terms of the contributions to the particle fluctuation energy, time-frequency distribution, as well as probability density function from POD modes. The energy distributions of POD modes suggest that the first two POD modes are most energetic and dominate the particle motion, and the dominance increases from the acceleration regime to fully-developed regime. The time-frequency characteristics of POD modes reveal that small-scale particle fluctuations are suppressed in the fully-developed regime. It implies that the suppression of small-scale particle fluctuations may result in lower pressure drop at MPD velocity. The PDF distributions of POD modes exhibit that the particle fluctuation of first two POD modes follows the Gaussian distribution in the acceleration and fully developed regimes. However, the PDF distributions of POD modes gradually deviate from Gaussian distribution as increasing mode number.  aPublisher supplied data 3aautocorrelation 3aenergy 3anormal distribution 3aparticle image velocimetry 3apowders 3awavelet 0aParticle fluctuation velocity 0aPIV 0aPneumatic conveying 0aPOD 0aWavelet transform1 aRinoshika, Akira0 tPowder technology.g2017 Oct., v. 320 p.726-738dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11732x0032-59107nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.powtec.2017.07.0923Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02236naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245005500158520113900213592002801352650002501380650001701405650001701422650001501439650001001454650001501464650001401479700002001493700001401513700002001527700001701547700001901564700001901583700001801602700001901620773012701639856007501766852000901841655001201850IND60754282920221120154242.0211023e20211015xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075428292DNAL7 a10.3390/md191005762doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Jichen 10aLaminarin, a Major Polysaccharide in Stramenopiles  aDuring the processes of primary and secondary endosymbiosis, different microalgae evolved to synthesis different storage polysaccharides. In stramenopiles, the main storage polysaccharides are β-1,3-glucan, or laminarin, in vacuoles. Currently, laminarin is gaining considerable attention due to its application in the food, cosmetic and pharmaceuticals industries, and also its importance in global biogeochemical cycles (especially in the ocean carbon cycle). In this review, the structures, composition, contents, and bioactivity of laminarin were summarized in different algae. It was shown that the general features of laminarin are species-dependence. Furthermore, the proposed biosynthesis and catabolism pathways of laminarin, functions of key genes, and diel regulation of laminarin were also depicted and comprehensively discussed for the first time. However, the complete pathways, functions of genes, and diel regulatory mechanisms of laminarin require more biomolecular studies. This review provides more useful information and identifies the knowledge gap regarding the future studies of laminarin and its applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3abioactive properties 3abiosynthesis 3acarbon cycle 3acatabolism 3adrugs 3amicroalgae 3asymbiosis1 aYang, Jianchao 1 aDu, Hong 1 aAslam, Muhmmad 1 aWang, Wanna 1 aChen, Weizhou 1 aLi, Tangcheng 1 aLiu, Zhengyi 1 aLiu, Xiaojuan 0 tMarine drugs.g2021 Oct. 15, v. 19, no. 10dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21403x1660-33977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/md191005763Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03195naa a2200637 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006300148245011800211300001600329520142000345592002801765650002001793650001101813650001601824650002001840650001601860650002201876650001001898650001701908650001001925650002001935650002001955650001301975650001101988650001301999650001402012653000802026653000702034653000802041653000802049653000902057653000802066653001102074653001102085653002802096653001902124653002902143653001402172700002102186700001702207700002002224700002002244700002202264700001602286700002102302700001802323700001702341773009502358856008302453852000902536655001202545IND60552514920221118012958.0180830e20161030xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055251492DNAL7 a10.1016/j.gene.2016.07.0582doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchneider, Eberhard1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4320-365210aCpG sites with continuously increasing or decreasing methylation from early to late human fetal brain development  ap. 110-118.  aNormal human brain development is dependent on highly dynamic epigenetic processes for spatial and temporal gene regulation. Recent work identified wide-spread changes in DNA methylation during fetal brain development. We profiled CpG methylation in frontal cortex of 27 fetuses from gestational weeks 12–42, using Illumina 450K methylation arrays. Sites showing genome-wide significant correlation with gestational age were compared to a publicly available data set from gestational weeks 3–26. Altogether, we identified 2016 matching developmentally regulated differentially methylated positions (m-dDMPs): 1767m-dDMPs were hypermethylated and 1149 hypomethylated during fetal development. M-dDMPs are underrepresented in CpG islands and gene promoters, and enriched in gene bodies. They appear to cluster in certain chromosome regions. M-dDMPs are significantly enriched in autism-associated genes and CpGs. Our results promote the idea that reduced methylation dynamics during fetal brain development may predispose to autism. In addition, m-dDMPs are enriched in genes with human-specific brain expression patterns and/or histone modifications. Collectively, we defined a subset of dDMPs exhibiting constant methylation changes from early to late pregnancy. The same epigenetic mechanisms involving methylation changes in cis-regulatory regions may have been adopted for human brain evolution and ontogeny.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA methylation 3aautism 3achromosomes 3adata collection 3aepigenetics 3afetal development 3afetus 3afrontal lobe 3agenes 3agenomic islands 3agestational age 3ahistones 3ahumans 3aontogeny 3apregnancy 0aASD 0aBA 0aCGI 0aCpG 0adDMP 0aDMR 0am-dDMP 0aAutism 0aFetal brain development 0aFrontal cortex 0aDNA methylation dynamics 0aMethylome1 aDittrich, Marcus1 aBöck, Julia1 aNanda, Indrajit1 aMuller, Tobias,1 aSeidmann, Larissa1 aTralau, Tim1 aGaletzka, Danuta1 aEl Hajj, Nady1 aHaaf, Thomas0 tGene.g2016 Oct. 30, v. 592, no. 1 p.110-118dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6378x0378-11197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gene.2016.07.0583Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02931naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002300150245006600173300001600239520170000255592002801955650002201983650002202005650002002027650001302047650001302060650002502073650001402098650001602112650001202128653002202140653001802162653001502180653001802195653001802213700002302231700005802254773011502312856008502427852000902512655001202521IND60582630120221120151438.0190412e201710  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058263012DNAL7 a10.1016/j.meegid.2017.08.0152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCastelhano, Nadine10aHeterogeneous recombination among Hepatitis B virus genotypes  ap. 486-490.  aThe rapid evolution of Hepatitis B virus (HBV) through both evolutionary forces, mutation and recombination, allows this virus to generate a large variety of adapted variants at both intra and inter-host levels. It can, for instance, generate drug resistance or the diverse viral genotypes that currently exist in the HBV epidemics. Concerning the latter, it is known that recombination played a major role in the emergence and genetic diversification of novel genotypes. In this regard, the quantification of viral recombination in each genotype can provide relevant information to devise expectations about the evolutionary trends of the epidemic. Here we measured the amount of this evolutionary force by estimating global and local recombination rates in >4700 HBV complete genome sequences corresponding to nine (A to I) HBV genotypes. Counterintuitively, we found that genotype E presents extremely high levels of recombination, followed by genotypes B and C. On the other hand, genotype G presents the lowest level, where recombination is almost negligible. We discuss these findings in the light of known characteristics of these genotypes. Additionally, we present a phylogenetic network to depict the evolutionary history of the studied HBV genotypes. This network clearly classified all genotypes into specific groups and indicated that diverse pairs of genotypes are derived from a common ancestor (i.e., C–I, D–E and, F–H) although still the origin of this virus presented large uncertainty. Altogether we conclude that the amount of observed recombination is heterogeneous among HBV genotypes and that this heterogeneity can influence on the future expansion of the epidemic.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHepatitis B virus 3adisease outbreaks 3adrug resistance 3agenotype 3amutation 3anucleotide sequences 3aphylogeny 3auncertainty 3aviruses 0aHepatitis B virus 0aRecombination 0aHBV genome 0aHBV genotypes 0aHBV evolution1 aAraujo, Natalia M.1 aArenas, Miguel1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0516-27170 tInfection, genetics, and evolution.g2017 Oct., v. 54 p.486-490dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12450x1567-13487nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.meegid.2017.08.0153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03153naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100003300149245012100182300001400303500001500317520159600332592002801928650001901956650001601975650001301991650002202004650001102026650001402037650001602051650002002067650001502087650001702102650001602119650001202135650001702147653001002164653002002174653001202194653002502206653001402231653001902245653000902264653001402273700003002287700003102317700002802348700003202376773012202408856008402530852000902614655001202623IND60567336320221122001356.0190411e201707  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056733632DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ympev.2017.04.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNavarro-Sigüenza, Adolfo G.10aComplex biogeographic scenarios revealed in the diversification of the largest woodpecker radiation in the New World  ap. 53-67.  a2019-12-06  aPhylogenetic relationships and patterns of evolution within Melanerpes, one of the most diverse groups of New World woodpeckers (22–23 lineages), have been complicated due to complex plumages and morphological adaptations. In an attempt to resolve these issues, we obtained sequence data from four nuclear introns and two mitochondrial protein-coding genes for 22 of the 24 currently recognized species in the genus. We performed phylogenetic analyses involving Maximum Likelihood and Bayesian Inference, species-tree divergence dating, and biogeographic reconstructions. Tree topologies from the concatenated and species-tree analyses of the mtDNA and nDNA showed broadly similar patterns, with three relatively well-supported groups apparent: (a) the Sphyrapicus clade (four species); (b) the typical Melanerpes clade, which includes temperate and subtropical dry forest black-backed species; and (c) the mostly barred-backed species, here referred to as the “Centurus” clade. The phylogenetic position of Melanerpes superciliaris regarding the rest of Melanerpes is ambiguous as it is recovered as sister to the rest of Melanerpes or as sister to a group including Sphyrapicus+Melanerpes. Our species tree estimations recovered the same well-delimited highly-supported clades. Geographic range evolution (estimated in BioGeoBEARS) was best explained by a DIVALIKE+j model, which includes vicariance, founder effect speciation, and anagenetic dispersal (range expansion) as important processes involved in the diversification of the largest radiation of woodpeckers in the New World.  aPublisher supplied data 3afounder effect 3awoodpeckers 3atopology 3amitochondrial DNA 3amodels 3aphylogeny 3aSphyrapicus 3aBayesian theory 3aMelanerpes 3amitochondria 3adry forests 3aintrons 3abiogeography 0agenes 0aDiversification 0aPicidae 0aBiogeographic models 0aNew World 0aFounder effect 0aGABI 0aDispersal1 aVázquez-Miranda, Hernán1 aHernández-Alonso, Germán1 aGarcía-Trejo, Erick A.1 aSánchez-González, Luis A.0 tMolecular phylogenetics and evolution.g2017 July, v. 112 p.53-67dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl3945168x1055-79037nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ympev.2017.04.0133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03318naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100003100151245010300182300001800285520099600303592002801299596012201327596011601449596013701565596013101702650002701833650001901860650002001879650001601899650002001915650002501935650001101960650004101971650001602012650001102028650002202039650001102061650001602072650001302088650004402101650002802145650001802173650001002191650001102201650001702212650001002229653001602239653001902255653002002274653001602294653002802310700002902338700003002367700003502397700003902432773012702471856008502598852000902683655001202692IND60654114120221117160058.0190722e20190917xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065411412DNAL7 a10.1080/14786419.2018.14608292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 ada Silva, Ueveton Pimentel10aAllelopathic activity and chemical constituents of extracts from roots of Euphorbia heterophylla L  ap. 2681-2684.  aEuphorbia heterophylla L. is regarded as a major weed worldwide. Its high aggressiveness in agricultural environment prompted us to investigate the allelopatic activity and chemical constitution of extracts from roots of this plant. Hexane extract showed low phytotoxic activity. Methanol extract at 2.0 mg mL⁻¹ inhibited 100% of germination, root and shoot growth of the indicator plants Sorghum bicolor and Lactuca sativa. β-sitosterol, stigmasterol, and esters of lupeol, germanicol, taraxasterol, pseudotaraxasterol, α-amyrin and β-amyrin were isolated from the hexane extract and their structures elucidated on the basis of MS and ¹H, ¹³C and DEPT-135 NMR data. GC-MS analysis of the derivatized methanol extract allowed for identifying a series of allelopathic organic acids potentially involved in allelopathic interactions of E. heterophylla. This is the first study on the allelopathic activity of extracts and identification of metabolites from roots of E. heterophylla.  aPublisher supplied data  a459271/2014-8cConselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológicodhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100003593  aAPQ-02789-14cFundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado de Minas Geraisdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100004901  aAPQ-02789-14cBrazilian agencies Fundação de Amparo à Pesquisa de Minas Gerais – FAPEMIGdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100004901  a459271/2014-8cConselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico – CNPqdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100003593 3aEuphorbia heterophylla 3aLactuca sativa 3aSorghum bicolor 3aallelopathy 3abeta-sitosterol 3achemical composition 3aesters 3agas chromatography-mass spectrometry 3agermination 3ahexane 3aindicator species 3alupeol 3ametabolites 3amethanol 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aorganic acids and salts 3aphytotoxicity 3aroots 3ashoots 3astigmasterol 3aweeds 0aphytotoxins 0aderivatization 0awild poinsettia 0afatty acids 0apentacyclic triterpenes1 aFurlani, Gabriela Milane1 aDemuner, Antônio Jacinto1 ada Silva, Otávio Luis Marques1 aVarejão, Eduardo Vinícius Vieira0 tNatural product research.g2019 Sept. 17, v. 33, no. 18 p.2681-2684dTaylor & FranciswJournal:J000000126x1478-64277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/14786419.2018.14608293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01848naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100003500143245011500178300001400293520046900307592002800776650002000804650003100824650001400855650001400869650002100883650001700904650002000921650001300941650004700954650002501001700002601026700002901052700001901081700002101100700002501121700003301146700002501179773013601204856007701340852000901417655001201426IND60523999120221121072453.0160701e20080331xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052399912DNAL7 a10.5586/asbp.2008.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNiemirowicz-Szczytt, Katarzyna10aPotential use of RAPD markers in characteristics of cucumber (Cucumis sativus L.) haploids and double-haploids  ap. 29-34.  aA study was designed to obtain hapolid and double haploid (DH) plants from cucumber cultivars tolerant to Pseudoperonospora cubensis.

Predicting the long term behaviour of cement is approached by reactive transport modelling, where some of the boundary conditions can be defined through studying natural cement analogues (e.g. at the Maqarin natural analogue site). At Maqarin, pyrometamorphism of clay biomicrites and siliceous chalks, caused by the in-situ combustion of organic matter, produced various clinker minerals. The interaction of infiltrating groundwater with these clinker phases resulted in a portlandite-buffered hyperalkaline leachate plume, which migrated into the adjacent biomicrite host rock, resulting in the precipitation of hydrated cement minerals.In this study, rock samples with different degrees of interaction with the hyperalkaline plume were investigated by various methods (mostly SEM-EDS). The observations have identified a paragenetic sequence of hydrous cement minerals, and reveal how the fractures and porosity in the biomicrite have become sequentially filled. In the alkaline disturbed zone, C-A-S-H (an unstoichiometric gel of Ca, Al, Si and OH) is observed to fill the pores of the biomicrite wallrock, as a consequence of reaction with a high pH Ca-rich fluid circulating in fractures. Porosity profiles indicate that in some cases the pores of the rock adjacent to the fractures became tightly sealed, whereas in the veins some porosity is preserved. Later pulses of sulphate-rich groundwater precipitated ettringite and occasionally thaumasite in the veins, whereas downstream in the lower pH distal regions of the hyperalkaline plume, zeolite was precipitated.Comparing our observations with the reactive transport modelling results reveals two major discrepancies: firstly, the models predict that ettringite is precipitated before C-A-S-H, whereas the C-A-S-H is observed as the earlier phase in Maqarin; and, secondly, the models predict that ettringite acts as the principal pore-filling phase in contrast to the C-A-S-H observed in the natural system. These discrepancies are related to the fact that our data were not available at the time the modelling studies were performed. However, all models succeeded in reproducing the porosity reduction observed at the fracture–rock interface in the natural analogue system.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaluminum 3acalcium 3acement 3aclay 3acombustion 3aenergy-dispersive X-ray analysis 3agels 3ageochemistry 3agroundwater 3amodels 3aorganic matter 3apH 3aporosity 3aprediction 3aradioactive waste 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asilicon 3azeolites 3aJordan 0aNatural analogue 0aNuclear waste repository 0aMaqarin 0aCement 0aPorosity 0aHyperalkaline plume 0aReactive transport model1 aLeemann, Andreas1 aMilodowski, Antoni E.1 aMäder, Urs K.1 aMünch, Beat,1 aGiroud, Niels0 tApplied geochemistry.g2016 Aug., v. 71 p.20-34dElsevier LtdaElsevier LtdwJournal:11912x0883-29277nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apgeochem.2016.05.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02654naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002200150245015000172300001400322520138100336592002801717650004401745650001501789650001201804650002201816650000901838650001601847650002001863650002301883650001601906650001501922650001401937650000901951650001601960653001901976653002401995653001402019653001702033773008802050856008502138852000902223655001202232IND60569137820221120084629.0180830e20170801xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056913782DNAL7 a10.1016/j.energy.2017.04.1672doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPourhoseini, S.H.12aA novel configuration of natural gas diffusion burners to enhance optical, thermal and radiative characteristics of flame and reduce NOx emission  ap. 41-48.  aA novel, simple and feasible method was proposed for increasing intermediate soot concentration and enhancing thermal and radiative characteristics of natural gas flame. In the method, based on pyrolysis technique, a portion of natural gas, as the secondary gas injection rate, was directly injected into the flame to create high temperature and emissive intermediate soot particles. The portion of the fuel dedicated to secondary injection rate varied in the range of 20–55%. The flame structure, axial temperature, soot concentration and radiation flux were examined and compared with those resulted from a prevalent burner. Also, the optical properties of intermediate soot particles were studied by BOMEM FTIR, IR flame photography and TES-1332A digital luminance meter. The results indicated that natural gas molecules injected into the flame were dominantly pyrolyzed into soot particles. These highly luminous emissive particles enhance the total flame emissivity and radiation. Moreover, considering exhaust emission limits, there was an optimum secondary injection rate (40%), which, besides enhancing the radiation of flame, maintained the emission of CO pollutant and UHC lower than the standard values. Furthermore, in the pyrolysis process absorption of heat from flame reduces maximum flame temperature and consequently NOx emission by 35% in the optimum case.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aabsorption 3aburners 3achemical elements 3aheat 3anatural gas 3anitrogen oxides 3aoptical properties 3aphotography 3apollutants 3apyrolysis 3asoot 3atemperature 0aSoot particles 0aNear IR wavelengths 0aRadiation 0aNOX emission0 tEnergy.g2017 Aug. 01, v. 132 p.41-48dElsevier LtdwJournal:12436x0360-54427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2017.04.1673Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02579naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001600150245010100166300001600267520134700283592002801630650001101658650001601669650001401685650002001699650001901719650001601738650002401754650001501778650001701793653003701810653001301847653002301860653001801883700001401901700001601915700001601931700001801947773009801965856008502063852000902148655001202157IND50060557420221120123543.0190318e201303  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006055742DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cropro.2012.12.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCao, Xueren10aDetection of powdery mildew in two winter wheat cultivars using canopy hyperspectral reflectance  ap. 124-131.  aTo determine the most sensitive spectral parameters for powdery mildew detection, hyperspectral canopy reflectance spectra of two winter wheat cultivars with different susceptibilities to powdery mildew were measured at Feekes growth stage (GS) 10, 10.5, 10.5.3, 10.5.4 and 11.1 in 2007–2008 and 2008–2009 seasons. As disease indexes increased, reflectance decreased significantly in near infrared (NIR) regions and it was significantly correlated with disease index at GS 10.5.3, 10.5.4 and 11.1 for both cultivars in both seasons. For the two cultivars, red edge slope (drred), the area of the red edge peak (Σdr680−760 nm), difference vegetation index (DVI) and soil adjusted vegetation index (SAVI) were significantly negatively correlated with disease index at GS 10.5.3, 10.5.4 and 11.1 in both seasons. Compared with other parameters, Σdr680−760 nm was the most sensitive parameter for powdery mildew detection. The regression models based on Σdr680−760 nm were constructed at GS 10.5.3, 10.5.4 and 11.1 in both seasons. These results indicated that canopy hyperspectral reflectance can be used in wheat powdery mildew detection in the absence of other stresses resulting in unhealthy symptoms. Therefore, disease management strategies can be applied when it is necessary based on canopy hyperspectral reflectance data.  aPublisher supplied data 3acanopy 3acorrelation 3acultivars 3adisease control 3apowdery mildew 3areflectance 3aregression analysis 3avegetation 3awinter wheat 0aCanopy hyperspectral reflectance 0aRed edge 0aVegetation indices 0aDisease index1 aLuo, Yong1 aZhou, Yilin1 aDuan, Xiayu1 aCheng, Dengfa0 tCrop protection.g2013 Mar., v. 45 p.124-131dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl34114x0261-21947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cropro.2012.12.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01612naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100002000112245008200132300001600214520059900230592002800829650002100857650002000878650002200898650001400920650001400934650001200948650001800960650001700978653002800995653002201023700002201045700001901067700002101086773014601107852000901253655001201262IND60706023020221118231311.0200807e201409  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070602302DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRahman, Shaista10aEffect of amalgerol and tebuconazole on tikka leaf spot and rust of Groundnut  ap. 355-357.  aThe results revealed that combination of tebuconazole 25EC + amalgerol @ 500ml and 2000ml/ha exhibited the best to control the diseases as well as improved groundnut crop health.

However, neither ecological nor cytological factors influencing intraspecific variation in endoreduplication are fully understood. METHODS: We cultivated plants covering the range‐wide natural diversity of diploid and tetraploid populations of Arabidopsis arenosa in common conditions to investigate the effect of original ploidy level on endoreduplication. We also raised plants from several foothill and alpine populations from different lineages and of both ploidies to test for the effect of elevation. We determined the endoreduplication level in leaves of young plants by flow cytometry. Using RNA‐seq data available for our populations, we analyzed gene expression analysis in individuals that differed in endoreduplication level. RESULTS: We found intraspecific variation in endoreduplication that was mainly driven by the original ploidy level of populations, with significantly higher endoreduplication in diploids. An effect of elevation was also found within each ploidy, yet its direction exhibited rather regional‐specific patterns. Transcriptomic analysis comparing individuals with high vs. low endopolyploidy revealed a majority of differentially expressed genes related to the stress and hormone response and to modifications especially in the cell wall and in chloroplasts. CONCLUSIONS: Our results support the general assumption of higher potential of low‐ploidy organisms to undergo endoreduplication and suggest that endoreduplication is further integrated within the stress response pathways for a fine‐tune adjustment of the endoreduplication process to their local environment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArabidopsis 3acell differentiation 3acell walls 3achloroplasts 3adiploidy 3aendopolyploidy 3aflow cytometry 3agene expression 3agene expression regulation 3ahills 3aintraspecific variation 3anuclear genome 3asequence analysis 3astress response 3atetraploidy 3atranscriptomics1 aMacková, Lenka1 aKubíková, Kateřina1 aKolář, Filip0 tAmerican journal of botany.g2022 Feb., v. 109, no. 2 p.259-271dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl44651x0002-91227nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ajb2.18183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04125naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100006100151245019200212520266600404592002803070650001503098650002203113650001903135650002003154650001603174650002003190650002003210650001503230650000903245650001303254653004703267653004403314653003003358653003303388653001503421653001203436700005903448773011303507856008603620852000903706655001203715IND60748061120221119162622.0220706e20211010xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074806112DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2021.1286422doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKoç, Mehmet Akif1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7461-979510aPrediction of emission and performance characteristics of reactivity-controlled compression ignition engine with the intelligent software based on adaptive neural-fuzzy and neural-network  aA fuel reactivity-controlled compression ignition concept promises to overcome increasingly stringent emission standards with ultra-low nitrogen oxide and soot emissions and very high fuel efficiency. In the present work, it was developed an intelligent software-based on adaptive neural-fuzzy inference systems in order to predict the emission and performance values of reactivity-controlled compression ignition engine fueled with natural gas and diesel under different operating conditions through an experimentally validated computational fluid dynamics model with the four cases generated in the study for intelligent software-based on neural-fuzzy systems simulation considering different input and output parameters. The engine model was run at input variables as initial pressure (1.67–2.79 bar), total fuel mass (60–130 mg), exhaust gas recirculation ratio (0–20%), the start of injection (32–56° before top dead center) and total 180 different conditions were generated while output responses such as indicated power, maximum in-cylinder pressure, soot, and nitrogen oxide emissions. The main operating parameters of the reactivity-controlled compression ignition engine were determined for different load conditions, enabling the engine to operate in a wide range with high efficiency and low emission. For the neural-fuzzy inference model presented study, the different number Gaussian curve membership functions (5, 6, 7, 8) (gaussmf) have been used considering different adaptive neural-fuzzy cases, and generally, about 13500 training cycles is found to be optimum neural-fuzzy inference parameters and minimum error value. Mean square error, mean error percentage, and the absolute fraction of variance (R²) were used to assess and compare the performance of the adaptive neural-fuzzy and artificial neural network. Results of the adaptive neural-fuzzy confirm that the model successfully predicts the performance and emission of the engine with the R² value % 99.8, %99.9, and %96.5 for the output parameters indicated power, maximum in-cylinder pressure, and nitrogen oxide, respectively. Moreover, the performance of the neural-fuzzy inference algorithm compared with artificial neural network and consequently, it was observed that neural-fuzzy inference gives more accurate predict value according to the artificial neural network. Moreover, generating a neural-fuzzy inference architecture using the proposed mathematical foundation given the study shows that neural-fuzzy inference is a very effective and helpful technique to predict the reactivity-controlled compression ignition engine performance and emission parameters.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3acomputer software 3adynamic models 3afluid mechanics 3anatural gas 3aneural networks 3anitrogen oxides 3aprediction 3asoot 3avariance 0aReactivity-controlled compression ignition 0aAdaptive neural-fuzzy inference systems 0aArtificial neural network 0aComputational fluid dynamics 0aCombustion 0aMethane1 aŞener, Ramazan1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6108-86730 tJournal of cleaner production.g2021 Oct. 10, v. 318 p.128642-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2021.1286423Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02695naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002300152245013300175300001400308520138900322592002801711650001301739650001101752650001801763650002301781650004101804650001101845650000901856650001901865650001501884650001301899650001601912650001401928653001501942653001101957653001301968653001701981653001601998700002102014700002602035773009202061856008702153852000902240655001202249IND60543089020221118004059.0190408e201505  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054308902DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodcont.2014.10.0282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLagunas-Allué, L.10aMobility and distribution of eight fungicides in surface, skin and pulp in grapes.

A lab test was carried out by immersing grapes in solutions with different concentrations of fungicides and for different periods of time; followed by a determination of the fungicide residues by GC-ECD with an additional confirmation by GC-MS. The distribution between surface, skin and pulp of the grapes was also determined. The percentage sorption ranged from 6.4 to 116%. Results showed that sorption values depended on the time that grapes had been in contact with the fungicide solutions, but not on the initial concentration of solutions. Residues were mainly found in skin, with percentages ranging from 53.0 to 88.4% of total residues. In pulp, these values ranged from 9.6 to 41.7%. Pyraclostrobin showed higher penetration than the other compounds.A field test using three new commercial formulations containing pyraclostrobin, boscalid and a mixture of both, was carried out by applying these formulations to a vineyard. When fungicides were applied individually the ratios of the skin/pulp residues were similar to those obtained in lab; whereas when a mixture of both pesticides was sprayed results showed a lower penetration of the fungicides in the grape pulp.  aPublisher supplied data 3aboscalid 3acaptan 3adichlofluanid 3afungicide residues 3agas chromatography-mass spectrometry 3agrapes 3apulp 3apyraclostrobin 3aquinoxyfen 3asorption 3avinclozolin 3avineyards 0aPesticides 0aGrapes 0aSorption 0aDistribution 0aPenetration1 aSanz-Asensio, J.1 aMartínez-Soria, M.T.0 tFood control.g2015 May, v. 51 p.85-93dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl56242x0956-71357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodcont.2014.10.0283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03874naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245008100171520222200252592002802474650001202502650001102514650001102525650001302536650001102549650002202560650000902582650001902591650001002610650001902620650001502639650002002654650001202674650001602686650001002702650001202712650001802724650002102742650002002763650000902783650001202792650001302804650001502817650000902832650001402841650002502855650002502880650002402905650001602929650000902945651001802954700002102972700001902993700002003012773013403032856008503166852000903251655001203260IND60672756120221120213556.0191017e20190613xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067275612DNAL7 a10.1093/cdn/nzz035.FS17-02-192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChawla, Anupama10aKwashiorkor in Upper Middle Class Suburbia in the United States (FS17-02-19)  aMalnutrition continues to be a major cause of death worldwide among children aged 5 years and under. We describe two patients who developed kwashiorkor while being predominantly fed rice milk. An 11-month old Caucasian male presented with a 3-day history of worsening edema, decreased oral intake, diffuse maculopapular rash, and poor weight gain. He was diagnosed with dairy, soy, and sesame allergies by two allergists and was placed on rice milk. Labs revealed hypoalbuminemia, anemia, transaminitis, zinc and copper deficiency. He was started on Elecare Jr and vitamin supplementation with clinical improvement. A 2-year-old Caucasian male presented with a 7-day history of abdominal distension, abdominal pain, edema, and rash. He had multiple food allergies. His diet consisted of diluted almond and rice milk, chips, apples, and corn. He had hypoalbuminemia and anemia with multiple vitamin deficiencies. Kwashiorkor is characterized by severe malnutrition, hypoalbuminemia, edema, irritability, and rash. It is rare in the US but is being reported in patients receiving rice milk as their major source of nutrition. Previously described cases were due to dietary manipulations by the parents. Both our patients were under the guidance of physicians. Rice milk has been suggested as an alternative for patients with milk protein allergy however; not all products on the market have the same nutritional value, with significantly varied fortification. A recent study examined patients diagnosed with CMPA fed an extensively hydrolyzed rice protein-based formula called Novarice. This formula contains 21.9 calories and 0.6 grams of protein per ounce. Both our patients were ingesting Rice Dream which contains only 15 calories and 0.13 g of protein per ounce. Infants who ingest rice milk are at high risk of developing severe malnutrition with hypoalbuminemia, edema, and nutritional deficiencies. It is important to educate not only consumers but health care providers on nutritional composition of these products. Translating an evidence-based study on the benefits of fortified rice milk into clinical practice needs to be performed cautiously since not all rice milk products are nutritionally alike.

This paper shows how some of these behavioral variables can be incorporated into an economic model to increase the predictability of the equilibrium adjustments between two segments of an industry. In this article, experimental work done by Siegel and Fouraker on individual behavior under bargaining conditions is incorporated into an economic model based on theoretical propositions developed by Edgeworth, Fellner, and others. The absolute limits of the bargaining range are established by the minimum profits acceptable to the firms engaged in negotiation. The equilibrium position within this range is determined by the distribution of bargaining power. The model is illustrated with the Michigan asparagus industry, in which a technological change in harvesting resulted in substantial shifts in the distribution of profits. The bargaining negotiations between producers and processors established a series of new prices for the raw product. On the basis of the analytical model, the outcome of the adjustment is hypothesized to be within a relatively narrow range of prices.

In this study, based on compiled 1394 surface soil δ¹³Cₒᵣg data in China, the relationship between soil δ¹³Cₒᵣg and precipitation and temperature are statistically investigated in the different climatic regions of China (i.e., Xinjiang region, Tibetan Plateau, northern China and southern China). The result show that, spatially, surface soil δ¹³Cₒᵣg values in Xinjiang region are mainly controlled by temperature and precipitation, while that are mainly controlled by precipitation in Tibetan Plateau. Surface soil δ¹³Cₒᵣg in northern China and in southern China are mainly influenced by temperature but with a contrary picture. Temporally, a decrease of Holocene δ¹³Cₒᵣg in Xinjiang region was caused by reducing temperature and increasing precipitation, while an increase of δ¹³Cₒᵣg in Tibetan Plateau was a response to reducing precipitation. A decrease of Holocene δ¹³Cₒᵣg in northeast China resulted from temperature decreasing and that in Loess Plateau from temperature decreasing and C₄ abundance reducing. In southern China, temperature decreasing since Holocene was responsible for an increasing trend of δ¹³Cₒᵣg sequence. Our results can be considered as a basis for the past climate and vegetation interpretation of δ¹³Cₒᵣg data inferred from various geological archives in the different climatic regions of China.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHolocene epoch 3aclimatic factors 3aclimatic zones 3aisotopes 3aorganic carbon 3apaleoclimatology 3arain 3asoil 3atemperature 3avegetation 3aChina 0aSoil δ13Corg 0aPrecipitation 0aPaleovegetation interpretation1 aYang, Yunpeng1 aRan, Min0 tQuaternary international.g2020 Jan. 20, v. 536 p.92-102dElsevier LtdwJournal:12411x1040-61827nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.quaint.2019.12.0153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02888naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001400152245012300166520150000289592002801789650001301817650002801830650001701858650002901875650002001904650001101924650001401935650001901949650001901968653001001987653002701997653001702024653001802041653003002059700001602089700001502105700001902120700001302139700001302152700001802165700001802183700001502201773010602216856008702322852000902409655001202418IND60773176220221118155317.0220509e20220720xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077317622DNAL7 a10.1016/j.colsurfa.2022.1288972doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Kai10aUltra-stretchable, adhesive, and self-healing MXene/polyampholytes hydrogel as flexible and wearable epidermal sensors  aThe hydrogel-based epidermal sensors have attracted tremendous attention due to their versatile potential applications in soft robotics, personal healthcare monitoring, and electronic skins. However, it remains a critical challenge for hydrogel-based sensors to simultaneously achieve self-healing capability and adhesiveness for full-scale human motion biomonitoring. Herein, we proposed a multifunctional MXene/polyampholytes nanocomposite hydrogel. The main network of this hydrogel was formed by the one-step radical polymerization of cationic monomer and anionic monomer. The simultaneous strong and weak ionic bonds-based crosslinking inside this hydrogel endowed it outstanding stretchable, tough, self-healing, adhesive properties, while the introduction of MXene further guaranteed the excellent mechanical properties and conductivity of this hydrogel. Our further exploration of this MXene/polyampholytes in the application as wearable epidermal sensor strongly proved its durable accuracy and sensitivity for the detection of human motions. This epidermal sensor also could be assembled to the detector of the daily activity monitor of Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) patients, which could be utilized to aid the ADHD treatment by remindering the patients to pay attention to their actions. Our work shed a new light on the development of eco-friendly wearable sensor for the personalized healthcare monitoring, human–machine interfaces, and artificial intelligence.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadhesion 3aartificial intelligence 3acrosslinking 3aenvironmental monitoring 3ahealth services 3ahumans 3ahydrogels 3ananocomposites 3apolymerization 0aMXene 0aNanocomposite hydrogel 0aSelf-healing 0aSelf-adhesive 0aWearable epidermal sensor1 aHu, Yunping1 aWang, Feng1 aLiu, Mingxiang1 aLiu, Pei1 aLi, Cong1 aYu, Yongsheng1 aXiao, Xiufeng1 aFeng, Qian0 tColloids and surfaces.g2022 July 20, v. 645 p.128897-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11945x0927-77577nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfa.2022.1288973Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02239naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100006000139245009400199300001800293500001900311500002000330520110400350592002801454650002001482650001301502650003001515650001401545650001001559650001301569650001101582700002901593700003201622700002101654773012001675856007301795852000901868655001201877IND60715622220221119122431.0201030e202011  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071562222DNAL7 a10.1111/mec.156282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGardon, Hélène1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8976-137212aA drift‐barrier model drives the genomic landscape of a structured bacterial population  ap. 4143-4156.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aBacterial populations differentiate over time and space to form distinct genetic units. The mechanisms governing this diversification are presumed to result from the ecological context of living units to adapt to specific niches. Recently, a model assuming the acquisition of advantageous genes among populations rather than whole genome sweeps has emerged to explain population differentiation. However, the characteristics of these exchanged, or flexible, genes and whether their evolution is driven by adaptive or neutral processes remain controversial. By analysing the flexible genome of single‐amplified genomes of co‐occurring populations of the marine Prochlorococcus HLII ecotype, we highlight that genomic compartments – rather than population units – are characterized by different evolutionary trajectories. The dynamics of gene fluxes vary across genomic compartments and therefore the effectiveness of selection depends on the fluctuation of the effective population size along the genome. Taken together, these results support the drift‐barrier model of bacterial evolution.  aPublisher supplied data 3aProchlorococcus 3aecotypes 3aeffective population size 3aevolution 3agenes 3agenomics 3amodels1 aBiderre‐Petit, Corinne1 aJouan‐Dufournel, Isabelle1 aBronner, Gisèle0 tMolecular ecology.g2020 Nov., v. 29, no. 21 p.4143-4156dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl48811x0962-10837nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/mec.156283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03739naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245011400170520228800284592002802572650001802600650002302618650001502641650002202656650002002678650001902698650001402717650001202731650001202743650001302755650001202768650001502780650001702795650001202812650003202824650004002856650001802896650001402914650001402928650001302942650001302955650001202968700001902980700001802999773013403017856008503151852000903236655001203245IND60672756320221120221500.0191017e20190613xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067275632DNAL7 a10.1093/cdn/nzz035.FS17-04-192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLabyk, Allison10aNew-Onset Pancreatogenic Diabetes After Near-Total Pancreatectomy for Treatment of an Insulinoma (FS17-04-19)  aAn insulinoma is an insulin-secreting neuroendocrine tumor of the pancreas. This rare tumor induces severe hypoglycemia and is often resolved through total or near-total pancreatectomy (TP). With the removal of the pancreas, patients lose their insulin and glucagon function, thus inducing a Type 1 diabetic state with complete dependence on insulin replacement therapy. This diabetes type is known as Type 3c or pancreatogenic diabetes. The patient was a 58-year-old female that presented with severe hypoglycemia (fasting blood glucose (FBG) 20–30 mg/dL). She was diagnosed with an insulinoma and underwent a near-TP. After surgery, she was diagnosed with new-onset Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (T1DM) with FBG 137–207 mg/dL. The nutrition diagnosis was food- and nutrition-related knowledge deficit related to lack of exposure to information as evidenced by new diagnosis of insulin dependent diabetes secondary to near-TP. She began insulin therapy along with education on diabetes management using dietary approaches. She will be monitored for malabsorption from pancreatic insufficiency. An interdisciplinary approach was used for treatment including a registered dietitian, endocrinologist, diabetes educator, and primary care physician. The literature on pancreatogenic diabetes treatment is scarce. Current American Diabetes Association standards of care do not set specific glycemic targets for Type 3c. Cases are treated as T1DM due to the reliance on exogenous insulin, yet there are some differences owing to the insufficiency of digestive enzymes and glucagon unique to Type 3c (e.g., patients may be more vulnerable to hypoglycemia). A multidisciplinary approach to bridge the patient's knowledge gap was used for disease management. An insulinoma induces severe hypoglycemia, while its treatment induces diabetes. In the absence of evidence-based guidelines, the clinical course and treatment is similar to that of T1DM due to the dependence on exogenous insulin. Thus, a multidisciplinary approach with focus on dietary strategies to manage glucose was used treat the disease. More research on the differences between Type 3c and T1DM and its subsequent treatment is necessary to minimize risk of chronic micro- and macro-vascular complications and hypoglycemia.

For this purpose, concretes containing 20% and 30% of glass powder (GP) have been tested. In addition, two concretes containing the same replacement ratios of GP and 5% of silica fume (SF) were also manufactured. The mixtures were characterized in terms of workability, compressive strength, microstructure and hygrothermal properties. The results show that the use of 20% and 30% of GP improves the consistency of the concrete in the fresh state by 41% and 55%, respectively. In the hardened state, the use of GP engenders an increase in porosity and slightly affects the pore size distribution. However, the SF reduces the critical diameter and creates a range of micropores. Despite the decrease of compressive strength with increasing GP ratio, the concrete exhibits satisfactory performance for structural application at both 28 days (36–41 MPa) and 91 days (40–45 MPa). The cement substitution by 30% of GP and 5% of SF highlights a decrease in thermal conductivity and the specific heat of about 17% and 2.3%, respectively. The water vapor permeabilities of the concrete used ranged from 2.07e-12 to 4.74e-12 kg/m.s.Pa.  aPublisher supplied data 3acement 3acompression strength 3aconcrete 3aglass 3amicropores 3amicrostructure 3aporosity 3asilica 3aspecific heat 3athermal conductivity 3awater vapor 0aGlass waste 0aSilica fume 0aMicrostructure 0aHygrothermal properties 0aConcrete1 aCherif, Rachid1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9988-38561 aTrabelsi, Abdelkrim1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0834-42061 aBelarbi, Rafik1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4662-20941 aBachir Bouiadjra, Mohamed0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2021 Oct. 10, v. 318 p.128647-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2021.1286473Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02493naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002800150245017300178300001400351520114400365592002801509650001801537650001101555650002001566650000901586650001501595650001101610650002101621650001601642653001701658653001801675653003201693653004601725653003901771653002701810700001701837700001801854700001701872773008801889856008501977852000902062655001202071IND60569138220221120084526.0180830e20170801xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056913822DNAL7 a10.1016/j.energy.2017.05.0542doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKumarasamy, Karthikeyan10aNovel CFD-based numerical schemes for conduction dominant encapsulated phase change materials (EPCM) with temperature hysteresis for thermal energy storage applications  ap. 31-40.  aEncapsulated phase change materials (EPCM) are the most common way to integrate with thermal systems for energy storage applications. Encapsulation greatly alters the thermal response of phase change materials (PCM) in terms of phase change temperatures and thermal hysteresis. Existing numerical schemes; however, can only simulate bulk PCM behavior and ignore the influence of encapsulation on the thermal response of EPCM. In this study, novel computational fluid dynamics (CFD)-based conduction dominant numerical schemes are developed for the first time to model the thermal response of EPCM and validated with the experimental DSC curve of the in-house fabricated EPCM capsules. The proposed heat source/sink scheme successfully predicts the heat-temperature responses and liquid volume fraction of EPCM with thermal hysteresis. It is recommended that the CFD-based conduction dominant heat source/sink scheme developed for EPCM in current study should be incorporated into energy simulation softwares for accurate performance predication when EPCM capsules are expected to be used in thermal energy storage systems and applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3aencapsulation 3aenergy 3afluid mechanics 3aheat 3ahysteresis 3amodels 3aphase transition 3atemperature 0aPhase change 0aEncapsulation 0aPhase change material (PCM) 0aEncapsulated phase change material (EPCM) 0aComputational fluid dynamics (CFD) 0aTemperature hysteresis1 aAn, Jinliang1 aYang, Jinglei1 aYang, En-Hua0 tEnergy.g2017 Aug. 01, v. 132 p.31-40dElsevier LtdwJournal:12436x0360-54427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2017.05.0543Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02271naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001600150245007600166300001600242520084500258592002801103650000801131650002101139650001601160650002501176650001101201650002301212650001001235650002101245650000701266650003001273650002501303650001901328650001201347653001101359653001301370653002301383653003601406653003101442700001601473700001301489700001401502700001301516700001101529700001801540700001701558773008501575856008401660852000901744655001201753IND60552020720221123033403.0170606e201508  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055202072DNAL7 a10.1016/j.molimm.2015.04.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLuo, Xiuxin10aCharacterization and antivirus activities of a novel bovine IFN-omega24  ap. 357-363.  aA novel bovine interferon-ω (BoIFN-ω) gene, which encodes a protein of 195 amino acids with a 23-amino acid signal peptide, was amplified from bovine liver genomic DNA through PCR and named BoIFN-ω24 according to its position in the bovine genome. In this study, the recombinant protein was expressed in Escherichia coli and antiviral or antiproliferation activity was determined in vitro. Results showed that BoIFN-ω24 exhibits high antiviral activity, which can be abrogated using PAb against BoIFN-ω24, and inhibits cell proliferation. BoIFN-ω24 also presents high sensitivity to trypsin and stability at pH 2.0 or 65°C, which are typical characteristics of type I IFN. This study revealed that BoIFN-ω24 is a potential novel effective therapeutic agent and provided a basis for further research on the BoIFN-ω multigene family.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aEscherichia coli 3aamino acids 3aantiviral properties 3acattle 3acell proliferation 3aliver 3amultigene family 3apH 3apolymerase chain reaction 3arecombinant proteins 3asignal peptide 3atrypsin 0aBovine 0aIFN-ω24 0aAntiviral activity 0aPhysicochemical characteristics 0aAntiproliferation activity1 aGuo, Yongli1 aBao, Jun1 aLiu, Ying1 aAn, Dong1 aMa, Bo1 aGao, Mingchun1 aWang, Junwei0 tMolecular Immunology.g2015 Aug., v. 66 p.357-363dElsevier Ltdx0161-58907nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.molimm.2015.04.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02397naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245007500163300001600238520113500254592002801389650002301417650002101440650002001461650001001481650001501491650002901506650001801535650003301553650001101586650001101597650001801608650001201626650001801638651001401656651001501670651001801685651001701703651001801720700001901738773010301757856008201860852000901942655001201951IND60588721820221120093052.0180619e201801  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058872182DNAL7 a10.1007/s10201-017-0526-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCai, Meijun10aPelagic zonation of water quality and phytoplankton in the Great Lakes  ap. 127-140.  aAnalysis of aquatic ecosystem data collected from large water bodies must consider spatial variations. A suite of pelagic survey stations exists for the Laurentian Great Lakes, but little is known about their redundancy. We present a strategy to delineate the lakes into zones based on water quality and phytoplankton biovolume. Water samples were collected from 72 sites in two seasons (spring and summer) from 2007 to 2010 in all five lakes. Integrated samples were analyzed for phytoplankton biovolume and nine water quality parameters. We conducted cluster analysis, principal components analysis and non-metric multidimensional scaling methods for water quality and phytoplankton taxon-specific biovolume for the Great Lakes basin and for each lake separately. There were significant lake-to-lake differences, and based on lake-specific analyses, Lake Superior, Lake Michigan and Lake Erie were each divided into three zones; Lake Huron and Lake Ontario were each grouped into two zones. The zones identified by water quality and phytoplankton provide an understanding of spatial distributions for evaluating monitoring data.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaquatic ecosystems 3acluster analysis 3adata collection 3alakes 3amonitoring 3amultidimensional scaling 3aphytoplankton 3aprincipal component analysis 3aspring 3asummer 3asurface water 3asurveys 3awater quality 3aLake Erie 3aLake Huron 3aLake Michigan 3aLake Ontario 3aLake Superior1 aReavie, EuanD.0 tLimnology.g2018 Jan., v. 19, no. 1 p.127-140dSpringer JapanwJournal:jnl3949861x1439-86217nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10201-017-0526-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01418naa a2200253 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100002500137245006100162300001600223500002000239520059300259592002800852650002700880650001100907650001100918773014300929856007101072852000901143655001201152IND60680209520221119223503.0200104e196602  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068020952DNAL7 a10.2307/12361822doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChisholm, Anthony H.10aCriteria for Determining the Optimum Replacement Pattern  ap. 107-112.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThis article is an attempt to clarify some confusion that has been apparent in the literature of agricultural economics in recent years with respect to providing a criterion for determining the optimum replacement pattern for long‐lived assets. In particular, for appreciating assets of the type represented by growing timber, the previous criteria have generally overlooked an important item of marginal cost: namely, the interest on the total revenue obtainable from the sale of the asset. These criteria have hence provided a replacement pattern which is longer than the the optimum.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural economics 3aassets 3aincome0 tAmerican journal of agricultural economics.g1966 Feb., v. 48, no. 1 p.107-112dOxford University PresswJournal:jnl44932x0002-90927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2307/12361823Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03158naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100002200155245014800177300001400325520142100339592002801760650001301788650001301801650003501814650003101849650001901880650001101899650003501910650002801945650001301973650004301986650005202029650001402081650000902095653003402104653002502138653002002163653001102183653001102194653000902205653000702214653000902221700002202230700002402252700002202276700002602298700001902324700003002343773014402373856009002517852000902607655001202616IND60679745320221116205153.0200210e202001  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067974532DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biologicals.2019.12.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJaafarpour, Zahra10aOverexpression of microRNA-375 and microRNA-122 promotes the differentiation of human induced pluripotent stem cells into hepatocyte-like cells  ap. 24-32.  aMicroRNAs (miRNAs) are involved in the regulation of gene expression. In this study, we evaluated the use of overexpression of microRNA-375 (miR-375) and miR-122 in differentiating the Human Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells (hiPSCs) into functional hepatocyte-like cells (HLCs) without growth factors. We also compared the differentiation by miRNAs versus growth factors. HiPSCs were divided into two main groups: 1- HiPSCs were induced using lentiviral overexpression of miR-375 to differentiate into definitive endoderm (DE) cells in seven days. Then lentiviral overexpression of miR-122 was applied to differentiate DE cells into HLCs in additional 14 days. 2- HiPSCs were differentiated into HLCs using growth factors in 21 days. DE and hepatocyte markers were investigated by qRT-PCR, immunofluorescence, secretion analysis and LDL uptake assay. In the produced cells of both groups: the expression levels of DE markers (FOXA2 and SOX17) and hepatocyte markers (albumin, CK18, and HNF4a) in comparison with the undifferentiated hiPSCs increased significantly in seven and 21 days respectively. The albumin and urea secretion and LDL uptake were also detected. These results weren't significantly different between two groups. Therefore, we demonstrated that the over expression of miR-375 and then miR-122 could differentiate hiPSCs into functional HLCs without growth factors for developing cell-based therapies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalbumins 3aendoderm 3afluorescent antibody technique 3agene expression regulation 3agrowth factors 3ahumans 3ainduced pluripotent stem cells 3alow density lipoprotein 3amicroRNA 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3asecretion 3aurea 0aInduced pluripotent stem cell 0aHepatocyte-like cell 0aDifferentiation 0amiRNAs 0ahiPSCs 0aHLCs 0aDE 0aMEFs1 aSoleimani, Masoud1 aHosseinkhani, Saman1 aGeramizadeh, Bita1 aYaghmaei, Parichehreh1 aMobarra, Naser1 aKarimi, Mohammad-Hossein,0 tBiologicals.g2020 Jan., v. 63 p.24-32dElsevier LtdaInternational Alliance for Biological StandardizationwJournal:11999x1045-10567nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biologicals.2019.12.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02905naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245016400168520135400332592002801686650001501714650001801729650002201747650002701769650001701796650002501813650001101838650002501849650002101874650002101895650001101916650002101927650001101948650002501959650002101984653001802005653002902023653002402052653002402076700001802100700001402118700001902132700001202151700001502163700001302178773011302191856008602304852000902390655001202399IND60748061820221119161418.0220809e20211015xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074806182DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2021.1286502doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHan, Jinlong10aDecomposition of pollutants from domestic sewage with the combination systems of hydrolytic acidification coupling with constructed wetland microbial fuel cell  aIn this research, three highly efficient combination systems, including constructed wetland microbial fuel cell (CWMFC), hydrolytic sludge acidification coupling with constructed wetland microbial fuel cell (HSA-CWMFC) and hydrolytic filler acidification coupling with constructed wetland microbial fuel cell (HFA-CWMFC), were applied to the removal of pollutants from domestic sewage. The three combination systems could effectively treat domestic sewage and generate clean energy. The power generated by CWMFC, HSA-CWMFC, and HFA-CWMFC was 0.36 W/m², 0.40 W/m², and 0.43 W/m², respectively. The results indicated that the removal rates of chemical oxygen demand (COD), total organic carbon (TOC), total phosphorus (TP), ammonia nitrogen (NH₃–N), and nitrate nitrogen (NO₃⁻-N) in HFA-CWMFC could achieve the optimal values of 91.01%, 90.63%, 95.35%, 86.11%, and 91.01%, respectively. In addition, HFA-CWMFC produced more organic acids than HSA-CWMFC, which was beneficial to the follow-up reaction. Through qualcomm sequencing analysis, it could be seen that Firmicutes, which could enhance power generation capacity and increase removal rates of pollutants, played an important role in HFA-CWMFC. The results demonstrated that the three combined systems had excellent application prospects for sewage treatment and energy generation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFirmicutes 3aacidification 3aammonium nitrogen 3achemical oxygen demand 3aclean energy 3aconstructed wetlands 3aenergy 3amicrobial fuel cells 3anitrate nitrogen 3apower generation 3asewage 3asewage treatment 3asludge 3atotal organic carbon 3atotal phosphorus 0aMicroorganism 0aHydrolytic acidification 0aConstructed wetland 0aMicrobial fuel cell1 aYang, Zhinian1 aWang, Hao1 aZhong, Huiyuan1 aXu, Duo1 aYu, Shuang1 aGao, Lei0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2021 Oct. 15, v. 319 p.128650-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2021.1286503Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03350naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245009600170300001800266520197700284592002802261650002502289650001402314650001302328650002402341650001802365650002402383650001202407650001802419650001202437650001602449650001302465651001802478653002002496653001702516653001702533653001302550653001502563653002402578700002102602700001502623700001702638700001902655773009902674856008602773852000902859655001202868IND60528511320221118143330.0190319e20160725xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052851132DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vaccine.2016.06.0482doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLee, Charlotte10aHurdles to herd immunity: Distrust of government and vaccine refusal in the US, 2002–2003  ap. 3972-3978.  aHigh rates of nonmedical exemptions (NMEs) from required childhood vaccinations have contributed to outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases, such as measles and pertussis. Understanding the parental decision to obtain an NME could help health professionals and public health programs improve vaccination rates in areas with high vaccine refusal. Using a 2002–2003 multi-state survey of parents of school age children (​n=2445), this study found that parental distrust of the government and of healthcare providers is a significant factor related to a number of vaccine-related beliefs and behaviors. The odds that parents who distrust the government have seen a complementary/alternative medicine (CAM) provider were 2.11 times greater than those of parents who trust the government (70.1% vs 52.6%; OR, 2.11; 95% CI, 1.59–2.84; P<0.01). Parents who distrust the government had increased odds of trusting vaccine information from CAM providers compared to trusting parents (57.9% vs 46.3%; OR, 1.53; 95% CI, 1.16–2.01; P<0.01). Parents who distrust the government also had increased odds of distrusting vaccine information acquired at their healthcare providers’ offices (12.6% vs 4.7%; OR, 2.64; 95% CI, 1.64–4.24; P<0.01). Distrustful parents had increased odds of thinking government sources of information about vaccines were unreliable, categorizing the CDC, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), or local and state health departments as poor or very poor sources (distrust government vs trust government: 25.2% vs 11.7%; OR, 2.39; 95% CI, 1.70–3.36; P<0.01; distrust healthcare providers vs trust healthcare providers: 24.4% vs 11.4%; OR, 2.44; 95% CI, 1.75–3.38; P<0.01). These findings indicate that distrustful parent populations may need to be reached through modalities outside of traditional government and healthcare provider communications. Research into new and more effective techniques for delivering pro-vaccine messages is warranted.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalternative medicine 3achildhood 3achildren 3ahealth care workers 3aherd immunity 3ainformation sources 3aparents 3apublic health 3asurveys 3avaccination 3avaccines 3aUnited States 0aVaccine refusal 0aAnti-vaccine 0aImmunization 0aDistrust 0aGovernment 0aHealthcare provider1 aWhetten, Kathryn1 aOmer, Saad1 aPan, William1 aSalmon, Daniel0 tVaccine.g2016 July 25, v. 34, no. 34 p.3972-3978dElsevier LtdwJournal:6210x0264-410X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2016.06.0483Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03257naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001800139245013400157300001600291520161200307592002801919650002801947650002601975650002302001650002702024650002602051650001602077650001702093650001702110650001202127650001902139650002302158650001302181650001102194650001002205650002502215650001402240650000902254650001602263650001602279650002702295650001402322651001102336651001302347700001702360700001802377700002102395700002402416700001802440773016302458856007302621852000902694655001202703IND50073079120221121142426.0150218e201403  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007307912DNAL7 a10.1111/jam.123882doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRibeiro, S.C.10aTechnological properties of bacteriocin‐producing lactic acid bacteria isolated from Pico cheese an artisanal cow's milk cheese  ap. 573-585.  aAIM: Evaluate technologically relevant properties from bacteriocin‐producing strains to use as starter/adjunct cultures in cheese making. METHODS AND RESULTS: Eight isolates obtained from Pico cheese produced in Azores (Portugal) were found to produce bacteriocins against Listeria monocytogenes and three isolates against Clostridium perfringens. They were identified as Lactococcus lactis and Enterococcus faecalis and submitted to technological tests: growth at different conditions of temperature and salt, acid production, proteolysis, lipolysis, coexistence, enzymatic profile and autolytic capacity. Safety evaluation was performed by evaluating haemolytic, gelatinase and DNase activity, resistance to antibiotics and the presence of virulence genes. Some isolates presented good technological features such as high autolytic activity, acid and diacetyl production. Lactococcus lactis was negative for all virulence genes tested and inhibit the growth of all Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) isolates. Enterococci were positive for the presence of some virulence genes, but none of the isolates were classified as resistant to important antibiotics. CONCLUSIONS: The bacteriocin‐producing Lc. lactis present good potential for application in food as adjunct culture in cheese production. The study also reveals good technological features for some Enterococcus isolates. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Bacteriocin‐producing strains presented important technological properties to be exploited as new adjunct culture for the dairy industry, influencing flavour development and improve safety.  aPublisher supplied data 3aClostridium perfringens 3aEnterococcus faecalis 3aLactococcus lactis 3aListeria monocytogenes 3aantibiotic resistance 3aantibiotics 3abacteriocins 3acheesemaking 3acheeses 3adairy industry 3adeoxyribonucleases 3adiacetyl 3aflavor 3agenes 3alactic acid bacteria 3alipolysis 3amilk 3aproteolysis 3atemperature 3atraditional technology 3avirulence 3aAzores 3aPortugal1 aCoelho, M.C.1 aTodorov, S.D.1 aFranco, B.D.G.M.1 aDapkevicius, M.L.E.1 aSilva, C.C.G.0 tJournal of applied microbiology.g2014 Mar., v. 116, no. 3 p.573-585dPublished for the Society for Applied Bacteriology by Blackwell Sciencex1364-50727nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jam.123883Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01466naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100002000137245006800157300001400225500001700239520054800256592002800804650001700832650002000849650001000869650001100879650001600890650001100906651001400917773014100931856007101072852000901143655001201152IND60680209620221119223847.0200104e196602  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068020962DNAL7 a10.2307/12361752doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWinkelmann, Don12aA Case Study of the Exodus of Labor from Agriculture: Minnesota  ap. 12-21.  aCase Reports  aThe reduction in the quantity of labor available to agriculture has been a topic of substantial interest.

Solar PV shadings can effectively reduce the solar heat gain through windows, but might have a negative impact on the indoor daylight performance. Therefore, it is worth investigating the optimum design of solar PV shadings since the thermal, daylighting and power generation performance are closely integrated. In this paper, a numerical simulation model was utilized on the basis of EnergyPlus to investigate the energy saving potential of solar PV shadings with various tilt angles and orientations in Hong Kong. The results indicate that the optimum installation position for solar PV shadings is south facade with 30° tilt angle in order to maximize the electricity generation. However, considering the electricity savings from air-conditioning system and the increased electricity consumption for artificial lighting, it is recommended that solar PV shadings should be installed on a south facade with 20° tilt angle. Furthermore, the annual overall electricity benefits of solar PV shadings were compared with the widely used interior blinds. The results show that the well-designed solar PV shadings can achieve much more annual overall electricity benefits than interior blinds.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair conditioning 3abuildings 3aelectric energy consumption 3aelectricity 3aelectricity generation 3aenergy conservation 3aheat 3alighting 3apower generation 3ashade 3asimulation models 3asolar radiation 3aChina 0aBuilding integrated photovoltaics (BIPV) 0aSolar photovoltaic (PV) shading 0aEnergy saving potential 0aOptimum design1 aLü, Lin,1 aPeng, Jinqing0 tEnergy.g2017 Oct. 15, v. 137 p.1152-1158dElsevier LtdwJournal:12436x0360-54427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2017.04.1663Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03748naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001300150245018300163500002200346520218100368592002802549650001102577650001402588650001902602650001202621650000902633650002602642650002202668650001302690650002502703650001502728650002602743650002402769650001402793650001602807653004002823653003502863653001302898653003802911653002602949653001302975700001402988700001803002700001403020700001603034700001603050773007103066856008403137852000903221655001203230IND60585740920221119091612.0171114s2017    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058574092DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chroma.2017.11.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLuo, Xin10aLiquid chromatography coupled to quadrupole-Orbitrap high resolution mass spectrometry based method for target analysis and suspect screening of non-ionic surfactants in textiles  aPre-press version  aIn this study, we describe a high-throughput and sensitive method for textiles analysis, using liquid chromatography coupled to quadrupole-Orbitrap high resolution mass spectrometry (LC-Q-Orbitrap HRMS), for the simultaneously quantitative analysis of 40 target alkylphenol polyethoxylates (APEO) oligomers with reference standards and screening of 160 alcohol polyethoxylates (AEO) oligomers without standards in textiles. The APEOs contain nonylphenol ethoxylates (NPEOs) and octylphenol ethoxylates (OPEOs) with an EO number of ethylene oxide of 1-20, while AEOs focus on C11EOs-C18EOs with an EO number of 1-20. After ultrasonic extraction in methanol, the extract was directly separated using a core-shell CORTECS C18+ column and analyzed by Full MS/dd-MS2 (data dependent acquisition) scan in ESI positive mode. Two best sensitivity experimental conditions for APEOs with short EO chains (AP(EO)1-2) and long EO chains (AP(EO)3-20) were investigated, respectively. Most APEO oligomers had wide concentration ranges and the correlation coefficients (R2) were higher than 0.999. The limit of quantitation (LOQ) values for NP(EO)3-20 oligomers ranges from 16.00 to 52.80μg/kg and for OP(EO)3-20 oligomers is from 2.40 to 8.00μg/kg. LOQ for NP(EO)1 and NP(EO)2, OP(EO)1 and OP(EO)2 was 2.40mg/kg and 0.24mg/kg, 1.20mg/kg and 0.16mg/kg, respectively. The average recovery for each APEO oligomer in cotton and polyester matrix was between 78% and 110% at three spiked levels and the relative standard deviation (RSD %) was below 10%. As to AEOs suspects, a HRMS compound database containing 160 AEO oligomers was built and several parameters such as exact m/z, isotopic patterns, predicted product ions and predicted retention time were used for screening and confirmation. The established method was successfully applied for analysis of 40 commercial textile samples. Compared with OPEOs, NPEOs, especially NP(EO)3-15 oligomers, were widely detected in samples and the total concentration ranged from 1.56 to 1376.31mg/kg. AEOs were also found in most samples, among which C12-14, C16 and C18 compounds appeared more frequently and the EO chains mainly ranged from 3 to 15.  aPublisher supplied data 3acotton 3adatabases 3aethylene oxide 3afabrics 3aions 3aliquid chromatography 3amass spectrometry 3amethanol 3anonionic surfactants 3apolyesters 3aquantitative analysis 3areference standards 3ascreening 3aultrasonics 0aAlkylphenol polyethoxylates (APEOs) 0aAlcohol polyethoxylates (AEOs) 0aOrbitrap 0aHigh resolution mass spectrometry 0aLiquid chromatography 0aTextiles1 aZhang, Li1 aNiu, Zengyuan1 aYe, Xiwen1 aTang, Zhixu1 aXia, Shuwei0 tJournal of chromatography.g2017, dElsevier B.V.x0021-96737nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chroma.2017.11.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02647naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245011400168520138100282592002801663650002901691650001401720650001101734650002001745650001701765650002801782651001001810653002101820653001901841653003101860653002301891653002701914700001601941700001901957700001401976700002001990700001902010773011302029856008602142852000902228655001202237IND60748061920221119161304.0211206e20211020xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074806192DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2021.1286512doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWu, Wei-ping10aGreen efficiency of water resources in Northwest China: Spatial-temporal heterogeneity and convergence trends  aGreen efficiency of water resources (WGE) is the basis for developing cleaner production and implementing sustainable development. This study deconstructs WGE into the components of green efficiency identified as agricultural water (AGE), industrial water (IGE), domestic service water (SGE), and ecological water (EGE), then analyzes the dynamic change trend, spatial-temporal evolution characteristics and spatial convergence of identified WGE in Northwest China utilizing the Super-SBM model, spatial convergence model together with an exploration spatial data analysis. The results show that the average of SGE and its average annual growth after 2007 are the highest; Not only do AGE, IGE, SGE, and EGE have obvious spatial-temporal heterogeneity, they will eventually converge into one steady-state growth trajectory at different rates (about 3.8, 3.30, 3.25 and 3.20), which are related to the level of economic development, population size, industrial structure, government expenditure and spatial spillover effects from joining or adjacent areas. In addition to selectively improving some external conditions to promote the path of steady growth of water resources, local governments in Northwest China can also explore the construction of cooperative management and restriction mechanisms on cross-regional water resources to build a “destiny community” for WGE.  aPublisher supplied data 3acollaborative management 3aevolution 3amodels 3apopulation size 3aspatial data 3asustainable development 3aChina 0aGreen efficiency 0aWater resource 0aSpatial-temporal evolution 0aConvergence trends 0aIndustry heterogeneity1 aZhu, Yi-fei1 aZeng, Wei-kang1 aWang, Min1 aYang, Dong-xiao1 aChen, Wen-feng0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2021 Oct. 20, v. 320 p.128651-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2021.1286513Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03994naa a2200661 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100006500140245013300205300001600338500002000354520158400374592002801958596008501986596009402071596007902165596007302244650001902317650002602336650002402362650001402386650003002400650001902430650001602449650000902465650001502474650000902489650001202498650002302510650004402533650000902577650002702586650001202613650001502625650001802640650002302658650001302681650001402694700002502708700003402733700002402767700004102791700002902832700004102861700002402902700002902926700004002955700003002995700002103025700004003046773015003086856007503236852000903311655001203320IND60772785820221119104930.0220410e202204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077278582DNAL7 a10.1002/aocs.125802doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMoreira, Denise Ramos1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9468-558910aGreen lubricants production from Nile tilapia waste and prediction of physical properties through molecular dynamics simulations  ap. 341-352.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aFish farming is a worldwide growing activity and a large amount of residues is produced in this process. The present work describes a cleaner and sustainable way to produce new lubricants from fish waste oil. Oil extracted from the Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) viscera was utilized as raw material to produce basic oil for lubricants. The products were synthesized by esterification with polyols, trimethylolpropane (TMP) and pentaerythritol (PE), using p‐toluenesulfonic acid (p‐TSA) as catalyst. The synthesized esters were characterized by infrared (IR) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). Computational methods were used to predict the physical characteristics of the material. In addition, the main physicochemical properties were evaluated, as well as the thermal behavior and toxicity of the products against Artemia salina. The synthesized esters showed high viscosity indexes (VI > 150) and viscosities that fit the degree of application ISO‐46 and 150. Molecular dynamics simulations indicated that at room temperature the lubricants Tilapia fatty acid ‐ trimethylolpropane ester (T‐TMPE) and Tilapia fatty acid ‐ pentaerythritol ester (T‐PEE) are in liquid and gel states, respectively, confirming the experimental data. The products did not present toxicity against A. salina. In this research, we reinforce the potential of using tilapia oil from waste to produce green lubricants as a strategy to reduce damage to the environment, as well as the use of computational methods that collaborate to predict physical properties of lubricants.  aPublisher supplied data  a307837/2017‐3cConselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico  a88881‐144058/2017‐01cCoordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior  a0546/2018cCoordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior  a001cCoordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior 3aArtemia salina 3aOreochromis niloticus 3aambient temperature 3acatalysts 3aenvironmental degradation 3aesterification 3afatty acids 3afish 3afish waste 3agels 3aliquids 3amolecular dynamics 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aoils 3ap-toluenesulfonic acid 3apolyols 3aprediction 3araw materials 3athermal properties 3atoxicity 3aviscosity1 aFerreira, Elano Nery1 aNeto, João Francisco Câmara1 aBezerra, Lucas Lima1 aMonteiro, Norberto de Kássio Vieira1 ado Valle, Camila Peixoto1 aArruda, Tathilene Bezerra Mota Gomes1 ade Lima Neto, Pedro1 aRodrigues, Jailson Silva1 aRodrigues, Francisco Eduardo Arruda1 aPetzhold, César Liberato1 aMaier, Martin E.1 aRicardo, Nágila Maria Pontes Silva0 tThe journal of the American Oil Chemists' Society.g2022 Apr., v. 99, no. 4 p.341-352dJohn Wiley & Sons, Inc.wJournal:jnl49535x0003-021X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/aocs.125803Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03135naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001900145245012900164300001800293520180000311592002802111650000802139650002502147650000902172650001802181650000902199650001302208650002202221650002702243650002402270650002102294650001202315650001802327650004702345650001202392650001002404650001402414650001102428650001802439650001002457700001902467700001702486773010502503856004802608852000902656655001202665IND4468719320221120125036.0120727e201109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446871932DNAL7 a10.1007/s11738-011-0721-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAsthana, Pooja10aMicropropagation of Sapindus trifoliatus L. and assessment of genetic fidelity of micropropagated plants using RAPD analysis  ap. 1821-1829.  aAn efficient in vitro propagation system has been developed for rapid micropropagation of Soapnut (Sapindus trifoliatus Linn.), a medicinally and economically important tree from nodal (axillary bud) segments of seedlings. The frequency of shoot regeneration from seedling node explant was influenced by the age of the seedlings, growth regulators and successive transfer of the mother explant. Explants from 4-week-old seedlings yielded the maximum shoot regeneration frequency (97.22%) on full-strength MS medium supplemented with 1.0 mg l−1 of 6-benzylaminopurine (BAP). After harvesting the newly formed shoots, the mother explants transferred to same medium subsequently produced a maximum of 5.16 shoots per explant after third passage. Further improvement in the morphogenic response occurred when the nodal explants excised from in vitro regenerated shoots were employed, and 6.89 shoots per explant were obtained on the same medium after the third subculture. Optimal rooting (91.67%) was obtained by placing the micro-shoots in liquid MS medium with 1.0 mg l−1 IBA for 24 h and then transferring to the agar solidified MS medium devoid of IBA. The micropropagated shoots with well-developed roots were acclimatized and successfully transplanted to soil with 90% survival rate. Genetic stability of the regenerated plants was assessed using random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD). The amplification products were monomorphic in micropropagated plants and similar to those of mother plant. No polymorphism was detected revealing the genetic integrity of micropropagated plants. This is the first report of an efficient protocol for regeneration of S. trifoliatus through organogenesis, which can be applied for further genetic transformation assays and pharmaceutical purposes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aSapindus trifoliatus 3aagar 3abenzyladenine 3abuds 3aexplants 3agenetic stability 3agenetic transformation 3aindole butyric acid 3amicropropagation 3amothers 3aorganogenesis 3arandom amplified polymorphic DNA technique 3arooting 3aroots 3aseedlings 3ashoots 3asurvival rate 3atrees1 aJaiswal, V.

The use of cellulose to direct hetero-assembly was achieved by in situ regenerating an ionic liquid mixture (CNTs, NPs, cellulose) in water, and was applied to the fabrication of flexible anodes consisting of CNTs and NPs. These anodes showed CNTs threading through their structures and exhibited strong interfacial contacts, which provided a relatively short lithium-ion diffusion length and continuous electron conduction pathway as well as high mechanical stability. When evaluated as an anode material for a lithium-ion battery, the flexible nanocomposites showed high reversible capacity and good rate performance compared to traditionally made electrodes, demonstrating a simple and green strategy for the industrial-scale production of energy-storage devices.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanodes 3acarbon nanotubes 3acellulose 3aelectrochemistry 3aenergy 3aionic liquids 3alithium batteries 3ananocomposites 3ananoparticles1 aChen, Gen1 aWu, Haobin1 aZhu, Meifang1 aLu, Yunfeng0 tJournal of materials chemistry A.g2017 July 11, v. 5, no. 27 p.13944-13949dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26903x2050-74967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c7ta03043f3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02583naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002000139245012900159300001600288520120700304592002801511650002201539650003001561650002101591650002101612650001801633650001701651650001401668650001101682650002301693650001501716650001501731650005201746650001901798700001501817700001901832700001501851700001601866700002201882773016301904856007302067852000902140655001202149IND50073079420221121214020.0150218e201403  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007307942DNAL7 a10.1111/jam.123902doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPoorbaghi, S.L.10aEffects of Lactobacillus acidophilus and inulin on faecal viral shedding and immunization against H9N2 Avian influenza virus  ap. 667-676.  aAIMS: The aims of this investigation were to compare the effects of Lactobacillus acidophilus addition as simple or microencapsulated (ME) probiotic and inulin as prebiotic to the broiler diet on the faecal viral shedding and immunization against avian influenza virus (AIV) with or without H₉N₂vaccination. METHODS AND RESULTS: Simple or ME forms of Lact. acidophilus, inulin and combination of them as synbiotic were analysed for their ability to enhance immunity against H₉N₂AIV and to decrease faecal viral shedding in Cobb‐500 broiler chicks. Our results indicated that probiotic as ME form can decrease haemagglutination inhibition (HI) titre significantly on days 34 in vaccinated trial (P < 0·05). Also, the effects of ME form of probiotic are more remarkable on reduction of viral faecal shedding detected by RT‐PCR. CONCLUSIONS: The study shows the significant role of microencapsulation on probiotic effects against H₉N₂AIV. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The application of probiotics especially in the ME form could have the potential for stimulating the immune system, preventing influenza infection and consequently reduce faecal viral shedding of H₉N₂AIV.  aPublisher supplied data 3aInfluenza A virus 3aLactobacillus acidophilus 3abroiler chickens 3ahemagglutination 3aimmune system 3aimmunization 3ainfluenza 3ainulin 3amicroencapsulation 3aprebiotics 3aprobiotics 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3aviral shedding1 aDadras, H.1 aGheisari, H.R.1 aMosleh, N.1 aFirouzi, S.1 aRoohallazadeh, H.0 tJournal of applied microbiology.g2014 Mar., v. 116, no. 3 p.667-676dPublished for the Society for Applied Bacteriology by Blackwell Sciencex1364-50727nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jam.123903Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02919naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245008000159300001600239500002000255520146300275592002801738596007701766650002201843650002401865650002001889650002201909650001301931650002401944650002101968650002301989650001802012650001102030650000902041650001302050650001402063650001302077650002102090700002102111700003702132700005802169773015002227856007502377852000902452655001202461IND60772786120221119105136.0220410e202204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077278612DNAL7 a10.1002/aocs.125762doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDent, Terrence10aRice bran wax structured oleogels and in vitro bioaccessibility of curcumin  ap. 299-311.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aCurcumin, the bioactive compound found in turmeric, exhibits a wide range of health‐promoting properties. However, its application in food formulations and as nutritional supplements is limited by its poor bioaccessibility. This study investigates the effects of curcumin on the structure formation and physical properties of oleogels made with three different concentrations of rice bran wax (RBW) (2%, 6%, and 10% w/w) compared to an ungelled control oil and examines the bioaccessibility of curcumin contained in those lipid systems. The physical and structural properties were characterized using a penetration test, solid fat content, polarized light microscopy, differential scanning calorimetry, and X‐ray diffraction (XRD). Data analysis revealed no significant differences in polymorphic or thermal properties between oleogels with and without curcumin; however, differences in microstructural properties were documented for oleogels with curcumin. Moreover, the percent of lipid crystallinity in 6% and 10% RBW oleogel increased in samples containing curcumin. An in vitro simulated digestion study showed that curcumin bioaccessibility significantly increased with increasing RBW content relative to the ungelled control. Results from this study provide insight into the potential utilization of RBW oleogels for delivering curcumin and other poorly water‐soluble compounds in food, dietary supplement, pharmaceutical, and cosmetic products.  aPublisher supplied data  aOHO01312cUSDA National Institute for Food and Agriculture HATCH Project 3aX-ray diffraction 3abioactive compounds 3abioavailability 3acrystal structure 3acurcumin 3adietary supplements 3ahealth promotion 3ain vitro digestion 3alipid content 3alipids 3aoils 3aoleogels 3arice bran 3aturmeric 3awater solubility1 aHallinan, Robert1 aChitchumroonchokchai, Chureeporn1 aMaleky, Farnaz1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4927-36270 tThe journal of the American Oil Chemists' Society.g2022 Apr., v. 99, no. 4 p.299-311dJohn Wiley & Sons, Inc.wJournal:jnl49535x0003-021X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/aocs.125763Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03064naa a2200637 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024005700111040001800168072000900186072000900195072000900204072000900213072000900222100002000231245011900251300001600370500002400386520098000410650001801390650001901408650002701427650001201454650002701466650002201493650002301515650001201538650002101550650001501571650002001586650002701606650005201633650001201685650005001697650000901747650003801756650001101794650006101805650004101866650003301907650002301940650004901963650001502012650004102027653002702068700001102095773012102106852000902227856010702236930003302343945002502376946001302401655001202414IND4393697520221122083814.0070804e200603  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439369752DNAL7 a166196172pmid7 a10.1603/0022-2585(2006)043[0318:PDIWKA]2.0.CO;22doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL823 0aL821 0aL200 0aL001 0aL6001 aBeerntsen, B.T.10aPlasmodium Development in White-Eye (kh(w)) and Transformed Strains (kh(43)) of Aedes aegypti (Diptera: Culicidae)  ap. 318-322.  aIncludes references  aXanthurenic acid (XA) has been implicated as an inducer in vivo of exflagellation in Plasmodium spp. Consequently, the development of Plasmodium gallinaceum was assessed in a white-eye mosquito strain, kh(w), of Aedes aegypti (L.), which is deficient in XA because of a mutation of the gene encoding the enzyme kynurenine hydroxylase, and in a transformed line of kh(w) mosquitoes that carry the wild-type cn(+) gene of Drosophila melanogaster Meigen and express a functional enzyme necessary for XA production. Although XA was not detectable in kh(w) mosquitoes by using high-pressure liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection, parasites were able to develop. Transformed kh(w) mosquitoes failed to consistently support parasite development at higher prevalences and mean intensities than did the nontransformed kh(w) lines, even though XA was detectable. These data suggest that factors other than XA may play a role in initiating Plasmodium development in vivo. 3aAedes aegypti 3ainsect vectors 3aPlasmodium gallinaceum 3amalaria 3abiological development 3avector competence 3astrain differences 3amutants 3axanthurenic acid 3aoxygenases 3aenzyme activity 3agenetic transformation 2aAedesxchemistryxclassificationxparasitology. 2aAnimals 2aChromatography, High Pressure Liquidxmethods 2aDiet 2aDrosophila melanogasterxgenetics 2aFemale 2aInsect Vectorsxchemistryxclassificationxparasitology. 2aKynurenine 3-Monooxygenasexgenetics 2aMalaria, Avianxepidemiology 2aMutationxgenetics 2aPlasmodium gallinaceumxgrowth & development 2aPrevalence 2aXanthurenatesxanalysisxmetabolism. 0akynurenine hydroxylase1 aLi, J.0 tJournal of medical entomology.g2006 Mar., v. 43, no. 2 p.318-322dEntomological Society of Americax0022-25857nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1603/0022-2585(2006)043[0318:PDIWKA]2.0.CO;23Available from publisher's Web site  a20070918b20071002c00000000  aINDdNZMe2007/09/18  aOther US 7aarticle03585naa a2200649 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002500152245012600177506010400303506007600407520173700483592002802220506003702248650001302285650001402298650001602312650002402328650001402352650001902366650001902385650001502404650001802419650001402437650000902451653001102460653000902471653000902480653001302489653000802502653000802510653001002518653000902528653000802537653000702545653000702552653000802559653000802567653000802575653000802583653000902591653000802600653001402608653001302622653001702635653001402652653001302666700002102679700002102700773010602721856008702827852000902914655001202923IND60773177020221207144700.0220531e20220820xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077317702DNAL7 a10.1016/j.colsurfa.2022.1289262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLefroy, Katherine S.10aRelationship between size and cellulose content of cellulose microgels (CMGs) and their water-in-oil emulsifying capacity  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aSoluble polysaccharides have been used extensively as gelling/thickening agents in emulsions, but they generally display weak surface activity. Insoluble polysaccharides such as cellulose can be converted to thickening agents and even emulsifiers, but generally only after considerable chemical modification. Here we use the ionic liquid (IL) 1-butyl-3-methyl imidazolium acetate (BmimAc) to dissolve and reprecipitate cellulose in the presence of oil, i.e., a physical process, to tune the cellulose properties. ILs have previously been used in this way to form hydrophobic (‘oily’) cellulose microgels (CMGs), potentially capable of stabilizing water-in-oil (W/O) emulsions. However, these previous CMGs were made via a ‘top-down’ method and were relatively large and polydisperse, giving limited stability to the W/O emulsions formed. Here we demonstrate how the CMG size can be drastically reduced via a ‘bottom-up’ approach and employing high-pressure homogenization (HPH), thus achieving sub-micron CMG particle sizes. This has previously been impossible with other reported IL-cellulose coagulation methods and the corresponding W/O emulsions were more stable. In addition, confocal and cryo-scanning electron microscopy (SEM) revealed that the surface coverage of these CMGs on droplets increased over time, which led to the formation of even thicker interfacial layers and further enhanced emulsion stability (at least 2 months). We also demonstrate unequivocally that the stability of the W/O emulsions is indeed due to the CMGs adsorbing via the Pickering mechanism, rather than forming a stabilizing cellulosic network in the continuous phase, thus providing a novel route to ‘green’ Pickering emulsions.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aacetates 3acellulose 3acoagulation 3aelectron microscopy 3aemulsions 3ahomogenization 3ahydrophobicity 3aimidazoles 3aionic liquids 3amicrogels 3aoils 0aBmimAc 0aCLSM 0aCMGs 0acryo-SEM 0aDLS 0aFIB 0aHIPES 0aHOSO 0aHPH 0aIL 0aJH 0aMCT 0aO/W 0aPSD 0aSLS 0aWAXS 0aW/O 0aCellulose 0aMicrogel 0aIonic liquid 0aPickering 0aEmulsion1 aMurray, Brent S.1 aRies, Michael E.0 tColloids and surfaces.g2022 Aug. 20, v. 647 p.128926-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11945x0927-77577nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfa.2022.1289263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01797naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002000152245013600172520069800308592002801006650001501034650002101049650001701070650001801087650001101105650001601116653001101132653001401143653001401157653000801171653000901179653002301188700002201211773010601233856008701339852000901426655001201435IND60773177120221118155701.0220509e20220720xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077317712DNAL7 a10.1016/j.colsurfa.2022.1289272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPal, Chittatosh10aLabel-free electrochemical biosensor for ultra-low level detection of Ag(I) using ssDNA functionalized multi-walled carbon nanotube  aProlonged exposure to silver(I) could harm both human health and the environment.

For older adults anticipating elective surgery, there is an opportunity to detect and correct malnutrition prior to surgery. However, there is limited evidence regarding the appropriate nutrition screening and assessment tools to use in this population and the extent of nutritional risk is unknown. The purposes of this study were (1) to assess the usefulness of a nutrition screening tool (Nutritional Risk Screening-2002; NRS-2002) and a nutrition assessment tool (Patient Generated Subjective Global Assessment; PG-SGA) by determining their sensitivity and specificity compared to the Nutrition Focused Physical Exam (NFPE) and (2) use these tools to identify the prevalence of nutritional risk and malnutrition in older, high risk Veterans preparing for elective abdominal surgery. Older Veterans (N = 76) referred to the VA Perioperative Optimization of Senior Health interdisciplinary clinic that targets high risk older patients preparing for elective surgery were administered the NRS-2002, PG-SGA and the NFPE by trained RDs. A contingency table was used to determine the sensitivity and specificity of the NRS-2002 and PG-SGA compared to the NFPE. Study population was 64.5% white, 86% male, and 72.3 ± 5.9 years of age. Results of sensitivity testing showed 46.2% for the NRS-2002 and 100% for PG-SGA. Specificity was 100% for the NRS-2002 and 98% for the PG-SGA. The PG-SGA (35.5%) and NFPE (34%) identified very similar numbers of Veterans as being moderately or severely malnourished. Accordingly, the NRS-2002 identified only 15.8% of Veterans at nutritional risk. The most important finding is the alarming prevalence of malnutrition in this population of Veterans, more than a third were found to be malnourished. Additionally, the NRS-2002, a screening tool often used in the clinical setting, failed to identify nutritional risk in these patients, misclassifying 46.2% of malnourished patients as nourished. These results justify further work to more effectively identify and treat pronounced nutritional risk in older patients anticipating elective abdominal surgery.

Fungi are no exception, although little is known about how they withstand anthropogenic pollution. Here, we document adaptation in the mycorrhizal fungus Suillus luteus driven by soil heavy metal contamination. Genome scans across individuals from recently polluted and nearby unpolluted soils in Belgium revealed low divergence across isolates and no evidence of population structure based on soil type. However, we detected single nucleotide polymorphism divergence and gene copy‐number variation, with different genetic combinations potentially conferring the ability to persist in contaminated soils. Variants were shared across the population but found to be under selection in isolates exposed to pollution and located across the genome, including in genes involved in metal exclusion, storage, immobilization and reactive oxygen species detoxification. Together, our results point to S. luteus undergoing the initial steps of adaptive divergence and contribute to understanding the processes underlying local adaptation under strong environmental selection.  aPublisher supplied data  a502931cJoint Genome Institute Community Science Program  aDEB‐1554181cNSF  a141461cFlanders Innovation & Entrepreneurships PhD fellowship  cHawaii’s Agricultural Experiment Station  cMontana’s Agricultural Experiment Station  aG079213NcFonds Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek 3aSuillus luteus 3aadaptive radiation 3acopy number variation 3aheavy metals 3amycorrhizal fungi 3apollution 3apopulation structure 3areactive oxygen species 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism 3aBelgium1 aRuytinx, Joske1 aKe, Yi‐Hong1 aConinx, Laura1 aColpaert, Jan V.1 aNguyen, Nhu H.1 aVilgalys, Rytas1 aBranco, Sara0 tMolecular ecology.g2020 Nov., v. 29, no. 21 p.4157-4169dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl48811x0962-10837nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/mec.156183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03180naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245008700164300001600251500001900267520169700286592002801983650001102011650001102022650000902033650001902042650001702061650001802078650001402096650001402110650001502124650001802139650001202157650001402169650002802183650001402211651001002225651001602235653002102251653001602272653001702288653001202305700002002317700001802337700001902355700002602374700001802400700001702418773011202435856008202547852000902629655001202638IND60679746120221116205344.0200128e202002  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067974612DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fsi.2019.12.0712doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRolton, Anne10aFlow cytometric characterization of hemocytes of the flat oyster, Ostrea chilensis  ap. 411-420.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe flat oyster, Ostrea chilensis, native to New Zealand (NZ) and Chile is considered an important ecological, cultural and fisheries resource. Currently, commercial landings of this species in NZ are restricted due to low population numbers caused by ongoing mortalities resulting from the presence of the haplosporidian parasite, Bonamia exitiosa. More recently, the arrival of B. ostreae in NZ led to major mortalities in farmed stocks. To understand how diseases caused by Bonamia spp. affect this oyster species, a more complete understanding of its biology, physiology and immune system is needed. The present study characterized, for the first time, hemocytes of adult O. chilensis, from the Foveaux Strait, NZ, using flow cytometry (FCM) and histology. Based on the internal complexity of the hemocytes, two main circulating hemocyte populations were identified: granulocytes and hyalinocytes (accounting for ~30% and ~70% of the total circulating hemocyte population, respectively). These were further divided into two sub-populations of each cell type using FCM. A third sub-population of granulocytes was identified using histology. Using FCM, functional and metabolic characteristics were investigated for the two main hemocyte types. Granulocytes showed higher phagocytic capabilities, lysosomal content, neutral lipid content and reactive oxygen species production compared to hyalinocytes, indicating their important role in cellular immune defence in this species. Methods of hemocyte sampling and storage were also investigated and flow cytometric protocols were detailed and verified to allow effective future investigations into the health status of this important species.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOstrea 3aadults 3afish 3aflow cytometry 3agranulocytes 3ahealth status 3ahemocytes 3ahistology 3aimmunology 3alipid content 3aoysters 3aparasites 3areactive oxygen species 3ashellfish 3aChile 3aNew Zealand 0aOstrea chilensis 0aFlat oyster 0aHyalinocytes 0aBivalve1 aDelisle, Lizenn1 aBerry, Jolene1 aVenter, Leonie1 aWebb, Stephen Charles1 aAdams, Serean1 aHilton, Zoë0 tFish & shellfish immunology.g2020 Feb., v. 97 p.411-420dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl4175048x1050-46487nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fsi.2019.12.0713Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02241naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002200150245013400172500002200306520104000328592002801368650001201396650005301408650002001461650001701481650002301498650001401521650002501535650001101560653001401571653001201585653001701597653004001614700002001654700001701674773007101691856008401762852000901846655001201855IND60585741420221119091545.0171114s2017    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058574142DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chroma.2017.11.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHeshka, Nicole E.10aGas chromatographic sulphur speciation in heavy crude oil using a modified standard D5623 method and microfluidic Deans switching  aPre-press version  aA modification to American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) method D5623 is proposed to enable successful and repeatable analysis of heavy crude oil samples. A two-dimensional gas chromatography configuration was implemented, with separation of sulphur compounds occurring on two columns. A Deans switch is used to enable heart-cutting of volatile sulphur compounds onto a DB-Sulfur stationary phase, and separation occurs concurrently with the backflushing of the primary column. The use of a sulphur-selective detector increases selectivity, and 22 volatile sulphur species are quantified in less than 15min, which is almost half the time of the original ASTM method. Samples ranging from light distillation cuts to whole crudes (boiling from 100°C to >750°C) were analyzed with minimal sample preparation. The calculated limit of detection was 0.7mg/kg, repeatability was 3% relative standard deviation (RSD), and a linear range of 1–250mg/kg was obtained, with an R2 value of 0.994 or better, depending on the compound.  aPublisher supplied data 3aboiling 3acomprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography 3adetection limit 3adistillation 3agas chromatography 3apetroleum 3astatistical analysis 3asulfur 0aCrude oil 0aSulphur 0aDeans switch 0aMultidimensional gas chromatography1 aChoy, Joanne M.1 aChen, Jinwen0 tJournal of chromatography.g2017, dElsevier B.V.x0021-96737nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chroma.2017.11.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02028naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245012100168300001600289520092700305592002801232650002201260650001301282650001901295650001601314650002001330650001801350650001201368650001101380650002201391650001101413650001201424650001301436700002201449773012601471856004801597852000901645655001201654IND50070417120221118034115.0131107e201311  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007041712DNAL7 a10.1134/S10623590130601372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSamoylova, E.

The larvae analyzed belonged to 19 Elateridae species inhabiting soils of the floodplain and the river terrace. It has been pointed out that the larvae of Paraphotistus nigricornis, Agriotes lineatus, Limonius parallelus, and Aplotarsus incanus are most tolerant to the regular spring flooding. It has been found that the species compositions of floodplains and terrace meadows are significantly different. As a rule, species with a wide tropical spectrum inhabit floodplain soils, including bush and forest habitats. At the same time, the terrace was dominated by species characteristic of open habitats, including the steppe zone. It has been revealed that the values of species diversity vary significantly in the floodplain and terrace plots, but the higher species richness (Menhinick index) was registered in the floodplain.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAgriotes lineatus 3aLimonius 3aalluvial soils 3afloodplains 3aforest habitats 3ainsect larvae 3ameadows 3arivers 3aspecies diversity 3aspring 3asteppes 3aterraces1 aStriganova, B.

The objective of this study was to quantify the surface runoff losses of nitrate-nitrogen (NO₃-N), total nitrogen (TN), dissolved reactive phosphorus (DRP), and total phosphorus (TP) resulting from prevailing practices on a managed golf course. Inflow and outflow discharge waters on a sub-area of Northland Country Club (NCC) located in Duluth, Minnesota were measured for both quantity and quality from April through November from 2003 to 2008. Nutrient losses were detectable throughout the year, had a seasonal trend, and routinely exceeded recommended levels to minimize eutrophication. The median outflow TN concentration (1.04 mg L⁻¹) was significantly greater (p < 0.05) than the median inflow (0.81 mg L⁻¹) concentration. Similarly, the median outflow TP concentration (0.03 mg L⁻¹) was significantly greater (p < 0.05) than the median inflow concentration (0.02 mg L⁻¹). Maximum recorded concentrations during the study period were 1.9 mg L⁻¹ NO₃-N, 3.93 mg L⁻¹ TN, 0.34 mg L⁻¹ DRP, and 1.11 mg L⁻¹ TP. Mean annual export coefficients at NCC were 0.7 kg ha⁻¹ NO₃-N (1.7% of applied), 4.43 kg ha⁻¹ TN (10.7% of applied), 0.14 kg ha⁻¹ DRP (2.6% of applied), and 0.25 kg ha⁻¹ TP (4.6% of applied). The findings of this study highlight the need for adopting conservation practices aimed at reducing offsite nutrient transport.  aPublisher supplied data 3aconservation practices 3aeutrophication 3aexports 3agolf courses 3anitrate nitrogen 3anitrogen 3aphosphorus 3arunoff 3aseasonal variation 3astreams 3awater quality 3awatersheds 2aEutrophication 2aGolf 2aNitratesxanalysis 2aPhosphorusxanalysis 2aRiversxchemistry 2aWater Pollutants, Chemicalxanalysis 2aWater Pollution, Chemicalxanalysis 3aMinnesota 0aMinnesota1 aBalogh, J.

One system was a recirculating VF wetland, and the other was a single-pass two-stage VF wetland. Operational modifications were made to each treatment system, with the aim of improving Total Nitrogen (TN) removal. For the recirculating VF system, attached-growth media was added to the recirculation tank to provide increased surface area for growth of denitrifying bacteria. The modification showed a small but significant improvement in TN removal (8 mg/L less than the baseline phase; p = 0.004). Statistical analysis showed that 30% and 4.5% of the increase in compliance with the TN limits (Class A and Class B/C, respectively) could be attributed to the modification. The two-stage VF wetland was modified with a step-feeding line that introduced carbon-rich raw wastewater to the intermediate pump shaft just upstream of the second-stage filter. The modification also resulted in a small but significant improvement in TN removal (13 mg/L less than the baseline phase; p = 0.005). The increase in compliance with the TN standard due to the modification was estimated at 20% and 22% for Class A and B/C, respectively. The simple operational modifications proved to be effective for improving total nitrogen removal in arid climate VF wetland systems.  aPublisher supplied data 3aarid zones 3acompliance 3aconstructed wetlands 3adenitrifying bacteria 3astatistical analysis 3asurface area 3atotal nitrogen 3awastewater 3awastewater treatment 3aJordan 0aArid climate 0aDomestic wastewater 0aE. coli 0aIrrigation 0aRecirculation 0aReuse1 aAbdallat, Ghidaa1 aAubron, Thomas1 aAl-Zreiqat, Iyad1 aAbbassi, Bassim1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0770-98001 aWu, Gi-Mick1 aAfferden, Manfred van,1 aMüller, Roland A.0 tScience of the total environment.g2019 June 25, v. 671 p.495-504dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.03.3763Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04406naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002200150245017700172300001400349520261900363592002802982650001103010650001403021650001503035650001903050650001103069650001203080650002103092650002303113650002203136650001103158650001003169650001503179650001203194650002603206650002203232650001703254650000903271650002103280650001003301651001203311653002403323653000903347653001503356653001403371653001603385653002603401700002203427700002903449700001803478700003103496700002503527700002003552700002003572773010603592856008503698852000903783655001203792IND60567333320221121152606.0190325e20180220xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056733332DNAL7 a10.1016/j.quaint.2017.04.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBörner, Andreas,10aPalaeoecological investigations and 230Th/U dating of the Eemian Interglacial peat sequence from Neubrandenburg-Hinterste Mühle (Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, NE Germany)  ap. 62-78.  aThe Eemian Interglacial sequence was explored in the gravel pit ‘Neubrandenburg-Hinterste Mühle’ near Neubrandenburg (NE Germany). The sequence is situated in a former kettle hole depression between underlying Late Saalian till (s. str. Warthe) covered by a Late Weichselian till. Today still visible a 3 m long and max. 2 m wide profile is located on the edge of the former Eemian depression. The limnic sedimentation began during the Late Saalian in a landscape characterized by open herbaceous vegetation. Cool, clear and calcium carbonate-rich lake water dominated, inhabited by Characeae that indicates a presence of stonewort meadows, most typical of waters up to 10 m in depth. The beginning of the Eemian Interglacial succession was characterized by a dominance of scarce birch forest followed by pine forest. The beginning of the mesocratic phase of the Eemian was characterized by the appearance of warm climate indicators and by the development of thermophilic forest communities dominated by oak forest with the appearance of warm climate indicators. The ensuing climate optimum was defined by the encroachment of hazel-oak forest and later by mixed deciduous forest. Limnic sedimentation ceased in the basin during this phase and the end of predominantly limnic conditions is marked by a decrease in the frequency of aquatic plants and an increase in the amount of brown mosses. During the interglacial optimum mixed forests reigned. This phase bears a record of oligotrophication leading to transition mire and raised bog and the aquatic plants vanished. The depression gradually became shallower and was overgrown by a forest cover. During the telocratic phase of the Eemian, communities with pine, birch and fir spread. The end of the interglacial was characterized by a disappearance of the riparian forest and a sporadic appearance of reedswamp plants. At the beginning of the Early Weichselian, a deterioration of climatic conditions resulted in the formation of widespread heaths on acid soils and trees disappeared. In the studied basin the water level fluctuated. The Hinterste Mühle sequence shows the development of a small kettle hole lake and its transformation to an overgrowing mire, including terrestrialization processes, during the Eemian Interglacial. The U/Th data obtained for five samples from the upper part of the studied profile, which have been analyzed by the TSD technique, has yielded an age of 116 ± 13/10 kyr. This date reflects the classification into the second half of the Eemian Interglacial and the Early Weichselian for the upper part of peat formation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBetula 3aCharaceae 3aacid soils 3aaquatic plants 3abasins 3acalcium 3aclimatic factors 3aconiferous forests 3adeciduous forests 3agravel 3alakes 3alandscapes 3ameadows 3amosses and liverworts 3aoligotrophication 3apaleoecology 3apeat 3ariparian forests 3atrees 3aGermany 0aEemian interglacial 0aPeat 0aPalynology 0aCladocera 0aMacrofossil 0aUranium-series dating1 aHrynowiecka, Anna1 aStachowicz-Rybka, Renata1 aNiska, Monika1 aMoskal-del Hoyo, Magdalena1 aKuznetsov, Vladislav1 aMaksimov, Fedor1 aPetrov, Aleksey0 tQuaternary international.g2018 Feb. 20, v. 467 p.62-78dElsevier LtdwJournal:12411x1040-61827nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.quaint.2017.04.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02373naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001900152245008400171300001300255520130900268592002801577650001301605650001801618650001301636650001301649650001901662650000801681650001901689653001601708653002101724653001001745700001501755700001801770700001801788773009801806856008601904852000901990655001201999IND60562600020221118060106.0170719e20170415xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056260002DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enconman.2017.01.0672doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKim, Min-hwan,10aFrosting characteristics on hydrophobic and superhydrophobic surfaces: A review  ap. 1-11.  aFabrication methods of the hydrophobic property on metal surfaces and frosting characteristics on hydrophobic surfaces were investigated. A hydrophobic surface with a static contact angle of less than 150° was implemented by surface coating or etching, and a superhydrophobic surface with a static contact angle of greater than 150° was realized by a hybrid method using both coating and etching. The changes in surface properties affected the behaviors of the early stage frosting from the dry surface to the formation of ice crystals. On the hydrophobic surfaces, ice crystals were formed by freezing after condensation. Isolated-droplet freezing and inter-droplet freezing are mechanisms by which the condensate undergoes a phase change into ice crystals. Through isolated-droplet freezing, a supercooled condensate changes phase into ice crystals by forming ice nuclei based on the classical nucleation theory. In addition, through inter-droplet freezing, ice crystals are propagated due to the difference in saturation vapor pressure between supercooled condensates and ice crystals. The formation and propagation of ice crystals are delayed as the static contact angle increases. Additionally, based on a review, future researches that is needed to improve hydrophobic technologies are discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3acoatings 3acontact angle 3acrystals 3afreezing 3ahydrophobicity 3aice 3avapor pressure 0aHydrophobic 0aSuperhydrophobic 0aFrost1 aKim, Hisuk1 aLee, Kwan-Soo1 aKim, Dong Rip0 tEnergy conversion and management.g2017 Apr. 15, v. 138 p.1-11dElsevier Ltdx0196-89047nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enconman.2017.01.0673Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02701naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004500094040001800139100002300157245009000180300001600270520128200286592002801568650001701596650001301613650001601626650002001642650001401662650004101676650002001717650001601737650003301753650001301786650001601799653001101815653002001826653001901846653001201865653003601877700003201913700002901945700006701974773011302041856009202154852000902246655001202255IND60582627720221120041115.0190412e201611  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058262772DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biosystemseng.2016.09.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTimsorn, Kriengkri10aEvaluation of bacterial population on chicken meats using a briefcase electronic nose  ap. 116-125.  aA novel portable electronic nose (E-nose) based on eight metal oxide sensors was used for evaluation of chicken meat freshness and bacterial population on chicken meat stored at 4.0 °C and 30.0 °C for up to 5 days. Aerobic plate counts were employed for the total count of bacterial population in term of typical biological analysis. Gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) analysis of fresh and spoilage chicken meats was presented. Principal component analysis (PCA) was used for pattern recognition and classification. A model for bacterial population evaluation was built by using a back propagation neural network (BPNN) based on sensor responses from the E-nose. The PCA results clearly showed the classification of chicken meat freshness corresponding to different storage days and temperatures. The E-nose with a constructed BPNN prediction model exhibited good evaluation of bacterial population on chicken with high correlation coefficient (R2 = 0.94) and mean square error of 0.016. The results suggested that the developed E-nose system can be used as a rapid and alternative way for evaluation of bacterial population on meats and offers several advantages including fast, portable, low cost, and non-destructive measurement with high relative accuracy.  aPublisher supplied data 3achicken meat 3achickens 3acorrelation 3aelectronic nose 3afreshness 3agas chromatography-mass spectrometry 3aneural networks 3aplate count 3aprincipal component analysis 3aspoilage 3atemperature 0aE-nose 0aQuality control 0aMeat freshness 0aGC–MS 0aBack propagation neural network1 aThoopboochagorn, Theeraphop1 aLertwattanasakul, Noppon1 aWongchoosuk, Chatchawal1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5613-66150 tBiosystems engineering.g2016 Nov., v. 151 p.116-125dElsevier LtdaIAgrEwJournal:jnl70639x1537-51107nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biosystemseng.2016.09.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01330naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001400140245008300154300002000237520031300257592002800570650001800598650002200616650002000638650001400658650001300672700002900685700002000714700003300734700003000767773012400797856007400921852000900995655001201004IND60640321020221120224334.0190504e20160202xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064032102DNAL7 a10.1039/c5ra27752c2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXu, Yifei10aSmectic liquid crystal polymers as a template for ultrathin CaCO₃ nanolayers  ap. 13953-13956.  aThe poly(aspartic acid) (pAsp) assisted infiltration of a nanoporous smectic liquid crystalline network with CaCO₃ yields only ∼1 nm thick crystalline nanolayers.

Prospective studies have outlined the beneficial effect of frequent fish consumption on cardiovascular incidents that is attributed to n-3 fatty acids incorporated in fish, mainly eicosapentaenoic (EPA), and docosahexaenoic (DHA) acids. This outcome triggered clinical trials to examine the effect of either fish intake or consumption of n-3 fatty acids via capsules on biomarkers related to cardiovascular disease (CVD). The absence of a recent review focusing on clinical trials regarding fish intake and not n-3 fatty acids supplements rendered necessary the composition of this article. In total, 28 studies on healthy volunteers were found to meet the inclusion criteria. With EPA and DHA intake varying between 0.03 to 5 g per day, biomarkers, such as triglycerides, high-density lipoprotein and platelet aggregation, tended to ameliorate when daily intake exceeded 1 g per day, while the most common inflammatory marker, C-reactive protein, was not affected. In all, fish consumption gives promising results; yet fish micronutrients, total diet fat, as well as other dietary habits may also affect biomarkers. Therefore, all these factors should be considered in future clinical trials in order for one to draw more reliable conclusions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aC-reactive protein 3abiomarkers 3acardiovascular diseases 3aclinical trials 3adocosahexaenoic acid 3aeating habits 3aeicosapentaenoic acid 3afish 3afish consumption 3ahigh density lipoprotein 3aomega-3 fatty acids 3aplatelet aggregation 3aprospective studies 3atriacylglycerols 3avolunteers 0aFish consumption 0aclinical trial 0acardiovascular disease 0athrombosis 0ainflammation 0an-3 fatty acids1 aFragopoulou, Elizabeth1 aAntonopoulou, Smaragdi0 tCritical reviews in food science and nutrition.g2019 July 20, v. 59, no. 13 p.2061-2071dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl39431x1549-78527nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10408398.2018.14373883Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02619naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245011900158300002000277520156400297592002801861650001101889650001901900650001201919650001701931650001301948650001501961650001301976650001401989650002302003700001902026700001702045773012402062856007402186852000902260655001202269IND60640321220221121005240.0190504e20160323xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064032122DNAL7 a10.1039/c5ra27756f2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNasir, Rizwan10aPrediction of gas transport across amine mixed matrix membranes with ideal morphologies based on the Maxwell model  ap. 30130-30138.  aThe incorporation of highly selective molecular sieve such as carbon molecular sieve (CMS) and highly affinitive solvent such as diethanolamine (DEA) into polyethersulfone (PES) have been implemented to synthesize amine mixed matrix membranes (MMMs) with an enhanced gas performance. Synergetic effect of CMS and DEA has caused the improvement of carbon dioxide (CO₂) permeability and ideal CO₂/CH₄ selectivity. While existing theoretical models define the relative permeability well for binary mixed matrix membranes they fail to predict the relative permeability of amine mixed matrix membranes. In fact, the degree of deviation from the simple model predictions provides understanding into the detailed properties of the third component, which has been neglected in previous analyses of these models. Modification of an existing model, namely the Maxwell model, provides an outline to analyze the gas permeation properties of model systems with CMS and DEA in glassy polymer phase. The new model is developed by modifying the basic Maxwell MMMs model. The modification also includes the optimization of λdₘ, which is defined as the ratio of dispersed phase permeability to matrix permeability, and the determination of permeability of the dispersed phase. Furthermore, this Maxwell model has been extended to model the performance of amine mixed matrix membranes by incorporation of combined volume fraction of filler and amine φ*ad. The proposed approach can predict the permeability of CO₂ through amine MMMs and also lowers the AARE % value.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon 3acarbon dioxide 3amethane 3apermeability 3apolymers 3aprediction 3asolvents 3asynergism 3atheoretical models1 aMukhtar, Hilmi1 aMan, Zakaria0 tRSC advances.g2016 Mar. 23, v. 6, no. 36 p.30130-30138dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c5ra27756f3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02609naa a2200649 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094024002200130024001900152040001800171100002700189245011000216300001600326506007600342520087700418592002801295506003701323650002201360650001501382650001901397650001001416650002201426650003401448650001301482650002001495650000901515650001101524650002001535653000701555653000801562653000801570653000801578653001001586653000901596653000801605653001001613653000701623653000901630653001001639653000801649653001101657653001401668653001001682653000801692653000901700653000901709653000801718653000801726700002301734700002501757773007401782856008201856852000901938655001201947IND60552513020221207115010.0161021e20151201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055251302DNAL7 a10.1016/j.gene.2015.08.0622doi7 aPMC66363492pmcid7 a263618482pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVeerman, Christiaan C.14aThe cardiac sodium channel gene SCN5A and its gene product NaV1.5: Role in physiology and pathophysiology  ap. 177-187.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe gene SCN5A encodes the main cardiac sodium channel NaV1.5. This channel predominates the cardiac sodium current, INa, which underlies the fast upstroke of the cardiac action potential. As such, it plays a crucial role in cardiac electrophysiology. Over the last 60years a tremendous amount of knowledge regarding its function at the electrophysiological and molecular level has been acquired. Furthermore, genetic studies have shown that mutations in SCN5A are associated with multiple cardiac diseases (e.g. Brugada syndrome, Long QT syndrome, conduction disease and cardiomyopathy), while genetic variation in the general population has been associated with differences in cardiac conduction and risk of arrhythmia through genome wide association studies. In this review we aim to give an overview of the current knowledge (and the gaps therein) on SCN5A and NaV1.5.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aaction potentials 3aarrhythmia 3acardiomyopathy 3agenes 3agenetic variation 3agenome-wide association study 3amutation 3apathophysiology 3arisk 3asodium 3asodium channels 0aAF 0aBrS 0aDCM 0aECG 0aFoxo1 0aGWAS 0aINa 0aINa,L 0aKb 0aLQTS 0aMEPPC 0amiR 0aNaV1.5 0aNF-KappaB 0aNHE-1 0aRos 0aSNPs 0aTbx5 0aUTR 0aVUS1 aWilde, Arthur A.M.1 aLodder, Elisabeth M.0 tGene.g2015 Dec. 01, v. 573 p.177-187dElsevier B.V.x0378-11197nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gene.2015.08.0623Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04243naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100003200150245013900182300001500321520257900336592002802915650001002943650002302953650001302976650001102989650001203000650001203012650001303024650002303037650002103060650001603081650001003097650001403107650003103121650001103152650001403163650001403177650001703191650002103208650001503229650001403244651002103258653002103279653001303300653001303313653000903326653001403335653001903349653002603368653001103394653002003405700002603425773010803451856008503559852000903644655001203653IND60567333820221121114843.0190705e20180920xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056733382DNAL7 a10.1016/j.quaint.2017.03.0452doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCourtney Mustaphi, Colin J.10aForest vegetation change and disturbance interactions over the past 7500 years at Sasquatch Lake, Columbia Mountains, western Canada  ap. 95-106.  aFire is the most important abiotic disturbance in the interior cedar-hemlock (ICH) and Engelmann spruce–subalpine fir (ESSF) forest zone of southeastern British Columbia, Canada. Other disturbances are also important, such as defoliator and boring insect outbreaks, windthrow, diseases, and rapid mass movements. Few studies have examined the interaction between multiple types of disturbances in these forests over long timescales. Here we present high-resolution analyses of biomass burning, erosion, and vegetation assemblage changes at Sasquatch Lake (NEL02), a valley lake in the Columbia Mountains. The 531.5 cm sediment core was radiocarbon dated and provided a 7500-year stratigraphy that was used for pollen, macroscopic charcoal (>150 μm), and sedimentologic analyses. Pollen and charcoal data provided evidence of forest composition changes and fire activity. Magnetic susceptibility, loss-on-ignition, and particle size distribution analyses characterised changes in erosion into the basin. The results show that coniferous forests, with a high abundance of Pinus pollen, had established in the catchment by the beginning of the record and were subject to intermittent burning and high-energy erosive events. Tsuga heterophylla expanded by 4400 cal BP and the modern interior cedar-hemlock forests expanded throughout the lower elevations due to increased regional continentality since 4500 cal BP. High-energy erosional inputs to the lake were less frequent from 3500 to 750 cal BP and rapid mass movements may have increased in frequency during the Little Ice Age. Dendrochronological evidence in these stands suggests a mixed-severity fire regime during past ∼300 years, which has not been fully examined for charcoal-based fire event reconstruction. Here we use identified peaks as an indicator of increased biomass burning and charcoal movement in the catchment in relation to peaks in allochthonous clastic material to understand the potential relationships between biomass burning and erosion events at multiple temporal scales in the catchment. This suggests that post-fire conditions, up to several decades, were subject to increased erosion to the lake and erosion events were more common during the early Holocene. Establishment of dense ESSF and ICH forests decreased siliciclastic input to the lake throughout the mid Holocene until a recent rockslide. The high-resolution sampling of this lake sediment record provides long-term evidence of variability in the relationships between vegetation cover, fire and erosion at a catchment scale.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPinus 3aTsuga heterophylla 3aaltitude 3abasins 3abiomass 3aburning 3acharcoal 3aconiferous forests 3adendrochronology 3afire regime 3alakes 3amountains 3aparticle size distribution 3apollen 3arockfalls 3asediments 3astratigraphy 3avegetation cover 3awatersheds 3awindthrow 3aBritish Columbia 0aBritish Columbia 0aCharcoal 0aConifers 0aFire 0aKootenays 0aMass movements 0aMultiple disturbances 0aPollen 0aSlope processes1 aPisaric, Michael F.J.0 tQuaternary international.g2018 Sept. 20, v. 488 p.95-106dElsevier LtdwJournal:12411x1040-61827nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.quaint.2017.03.0453Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02062naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001400147245011500161300001800276500001900294520099000313592002801303650002501331650001201356650002201368650002001390650000701410650001701417650001101434650000801445700001801453700001801471773013301489856008101622852000901703655001201712IND60709242020221118064619.0200904e202009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070924202DNAL7 a10.1134/S10619348200900992doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDong, Li,12aA Tin Film CMK-3 Modified Carbon Paste Electrode as an Environmentally Friendly Sensor to Detect Trace Cadmium  ap. 1201-1208.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aWe reported a tin film CMK-3 modified carbon paste electrode (Sn–CMK-3/CPE), a brand new electrode combining the ordered mesoporous carbons (OMCs) and tin film to detect trace cadmium. As one of the OMCs, CMK-3 has the distinct advantage of conducting electrons quickly and good adsorptivity because the pores in it are regularly ordered and controllable with the pore diameters of about 3.8–4.0 nm. Compared to the carbon paste electrode modified by CMK-3 and carbon paste electrode modified by the tin film, the Sn–CMK-3/CPE has higher sensitivity and stability in the process of detecting Cd(II). Under the optimum conditions (mass of CMK-3—4.0 mg; pH 4.70, Sn(II) concentration—6.5 mg/L, deposition potential—1.2 V, deposition time – 300 s), the Sn–CMK-3/CPE indicated a wide linear concentration range of 6–100 μg/L with the detection limit of 0.8 μg/L for Cd(II). This novel sensor was applied to the detection of Cd(II) in river samples with good recoveries.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanalytical chemistry 3acadmium 3acarbon electrodes 3adetection limit 3apH 3aporous media 3arivers 3atin1 aLuo, Hong Qun1 aLi, Nian Bing0 tJournal of analytical chemistry.g2020 Sept., v. 75, no. 9 p.1201-1208dPleiades PublishingwJournal:J000000418x1061-93487nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1134/S10619348200900993Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02883naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100005600150245013400206500002200340520145500362592002801817650001201845650002501857650001801882650001101900650002001911650001201931650002101943650001101964650001401975650001501989650001702004650002502021650001402046650002302060651002102083653000902104653000902113653001902122653001402141653001602155700002002171700002702191700001902218773005902237856008402296852000902380655001202389IND60532085520221119225929.0160726s2016    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053208552DNAL7 a10.1016/j.watres.2016.07.0342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLee, Sunggyu1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9983-739010aOccurrence and exposure assessment of organophosphate flame retardants (OPFRs) through the consumption of drinking water in Korea  aPre-press version  aOrganophosphate flame retardants (OPFRs) have been widely used as flame retardants and plasticizers in commercial products. Limited data are available on the occurrence and exposure of OPFRs via drinking water consumption. In this study, 127 drinking water samples were collected from tap water, purified water (tap water that is passed through in-house filters) and bottled water from major cities in Korea in 2014. The total concentrations of OPFRs (ΣOPFR) in all of the samples ranged from below the method detection limit (MDL) to 1660 (median: 48.7) ng/L. The predominant OPFR compounds in drinking water were tris(2-chloroethyl) phosphate (TCEP), tris(2-chloroethyl) phosphate (TCPP), and tris(2-butoxyethyl) phosphate (TBEP). Significant differences were observed in the levels of TCPP, TBEP and ΣOPFR among various types of drinking water. TCPP is introduced in the drinking water during the water purification process. Regional differences existed in the levels and patterns of OPFRs in water samples, which indicated the existence of diverse sources of these contaminants. Purified water was a significant contributor to the total OPFR intake by humans. The estimated daily intake of OPFRs was lower than the tentative oral reference dose (RfD) values. In comparison with exposure of OPFRs via dust ingestion, water consumption was a significant source of chlorinated PFRs (99% for TCEP and 34% for TCPP to the total intakes) for Koreans.  aPublisher supplied data 3aKoreans 3aaverage daily intake 3abottled water 3acities 3adetection limit 3afilters 3aflame retardants 3ahumans 3aingestion 3aphosphates 3aplasticizers 3apurification methods 3atap water 3awater purification 3aKorean Peninsula 0aTCPP 0aTBEP 0aWater purifier 0aTap water 0aHealth risk1 aJeong, Woochang1 aKannan, Kurunthachalam1 aMoon, Hyo-Bang0 tWater research.g2016, dElsevier Ltdx0043-13547nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.watres.2016.07.0343Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03712naa a2200637 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002100153245015700174300001600331520180500347592002802152650001502180650001602195650001502211650002002226650002102246650002402267650001002291650001302301650001502314650001902329650001702348650001002365650000902375650001102384650001102395650001302406650001702419650001802436650002402454650002102478650001702499650001502516650002402531650002502555650001202580650001302592650001902605653002602624653003102650653001702681653002502698653002702723700002402750700001702774700003202791700002302823773011902846856008802965852000903053655001203062IND60635077620221123033643.0190502e20190625xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063507762DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.03.3812doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSamadder, Asmita10aEfficacy of nanoencapsulated pelargonidin in ameliorating pesticide toxicity in fish and L6 cells: Modulation of oxidative stress and signalling cascade  ap. 466-473.  aRemoval of bio-accumulated pesticides in edible fish is a global problem. In this study, we tested protective capability of a phytochemical pelargonidin-loaded non-toxic, biodegradable poly-lactide-co-glycolide nano-particles (NPG) against toxicity induced by a pesticide cypermethrin (CM) in a fish model (Oreochromis mossambica) in vivo and also in L6 muscle cell line, in vitro. First we assessed potential sustainable release of nanoparticles following oral administration of NPG to fish, their ability to cross sub-cellular membranes in several tissues and efficacy to cross blood-brain-barrier. Next, protective ability of NPG, if any, against CM in fish was evaluated deploying parameters like % cell viability, DNA damage in muscle cells and modulation of anti-oxidative-enzymes like superoxide dismutase, catalase and lipid peroxidase. Modulation of reactive oxygen species generation, nuclear condensation and alteration in stress related protein signalling cascade were assessed in L6 cells. Results revealed that NPG had nano-size range (~10–12 nm) and negative zeta potential (−17 mV). Bioavailability and distribution of NPG could be followed by spectrophotometric absorbance of pelargonidin at 293 nm from 6 h onward till 24 h in all important tissues including the brain. Thus, 0.5 mg/g b.w. NPG could demonstrate protective ability in CM-intoxicated fish muscle cells in respect of % cell viability, DNA damage and stress related enzymes. Similar alterations could also be found in signalling protein cascade in L6 cells in response to treatment of 5 μg/ml NPG against CM-induced toxicity and depletion of overall ROS generation and nuclear condensation. Therefore, NPG could be used as a potential drug in management of pesticide toxicity in cultured edible fish.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA damage 3aOreochromis 3aabsorbance 3abioavailability 3abiodegradability 3ablood-brain barrier 3abrain 3acatalase 3acell lines 3acell viability 3acypermethrin 3adrugs 3afish 3alipids 3amodels 3amyocytes 3ananocapsules 3ananoparticles 3aoral administration 3aoxidative stress 3apelargonidin 3aperoxidase 3asignal transduction 3asuperoxide dismutase 3atissues 3atoxicity 3azeta potential 0aCypermethrin toxicity 0aPelargonidin nanoparticles 0aTilapia fish 0aIn vitro muscle cell 0aAnti-oxidative enzymes1 aTarafdar, Debojyoti1 aDas, Ruchira1 aKhuda-Bukhsh, Anisur Rahman1 aAbraham, Suresh K.0 tScience of the total environment.g2019 June 25, v. 671 p.466-473dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.03.3813Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03459naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002700151245013000178300001800308520163400326536008701960592002802047596014302075650001602218650002002234650001402254650001702268650002402285650002302309650002202332650001802354650001802372650002602390650001302416650001402429650002502443651001102468653001402479653002502493653002202518653001802540653001802558700003302576700002902609700003402638700002802672773014602700856008602846852000902932655001202941IND60654111620221122005253.0190726e20190720xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065411162DNAL7 a10.1080/10408398.2018.14377112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPereira-Santos, Marcos10aEpidemiology of vitamin D insufficiency and deficiency in a population in a sunny country: Geospatial meta-analysis in Brazil  ap. 2102-2109.  aStudies conducted among populations of tropical countries have reported high prevalences of vitamin D deficiency and insufficiency. Information resulting from meta-analyses on the spatial distribution of vitamin D deficiency and insufficiency in tropical countries is still rare. The aim of this review was investigated the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency and insufficiency among the Brazilian population. Observational studies were searched in eight electronically databases. Additionally, theses and dissertations and abstracts were screened. Details on study design, methods, population, mean and data on serum concentrations of vitamin D in different age groups in Brazil were extracted. Data were pooled using a random-effects model and choropleth maps were created based on the geopolitical regions of the country. 72 published paper met the inclusion criteria. The mean vitamin D concentration among the Brazilian population between 2000 and 2017 of 67.65 nmol/L (95% CI: 65.91, 69.38 nmol/L).The prevalences of vitamin D deficiency and insufficiency were 28.16% (95% CI: 23.90, 32.40) and 45.26% (95% CI: 35.82, 54.71), respectively, for the Brazilian population. The highest prevalence of deficiency were observed in the southern and southeastern regions and the highest occurrence of vitamin D insufficiency was among the populations of the southeastern and northeastern regions. Finally, there are high prevalence of inadequate vitamin D concentrations among the population, regardless of age group in Brazil. The development of vitamin D food fortification policies in needs to be cautious and carefully planned.  aM.

As a result of chemical texturizing, both all-jute and jute-polypropylene blended yarns experienced increases in available air space and breaking elongation. Increase in available air space signified increase in bulk, while increase in breaking elongation signified increase in the stretch of the yams. Incorporation of polypropylene not only resulted in higher bulk and stretch of the texturized yarns but also facilitated its preferential migration to the surface of the yarns during texturizing. The bulk of the texturized jute-polypropylene blended yarn was even greater than that of all- wool yarn spun out of coarse Indian Chokla wool. But the breaking elongation of all-wool yarn was higher and the uniformity of its diameter was better than those of texturized jute-polypropylene yarn having a blend proportion, jute to polypro pylene, of 80 to 20. All-jute and jute-polypropylene blended yarns suffered appre ciable drops in tenacity when they were chemically texturized, but even then, the tenacities of these texturized yarns were greater than that of all-wool yarn. Moreover, wet/dry tenacity ratios of these texturized yarns were much superior to that of all- wool yarn.  aPublisher supplied data 3anonfood plant products1 aMajumdar, A.1 aBhattacharya, G.K.1 aSur, D.1 aRoy, D.0 tTextile research journal.g1982 Nov., v. 52, no. 11 p.694-702dSage PublicationswJournal:jnl46536x0040-51757nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0040517582052011033Available from publisher's site 7aarticle02855naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002500140245012000165520144200285592002801727650001401755650001201769650001301781650001401794650001801808650001001826650001601836650001601852650001501868650001901883650001501902650001401917650002101931650001801952700002501970700002101995700002302016700002302039700002102062700002702083700002202110700004102132773012802173856007502301852000902376655001202385IND60754280720221123040154.0211023e20210929xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075428072DNAL7 a10.3390/md191005562doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWells, Carlos Montez10aSynthesis and Characterization of 2-Decenoic Acid Modified Chitosan for Infection Prevention and Tissue Engineering  aChitosan nanofiber membranes are recognized as functional antimicrobial materials, as they can effectively provide a barrier that guides tissue growth and supports healing. Methods to stabilize nanofibers in aqueous solutions include acylation with fatty acids. Modification with fatty acids that also have antimicrobial and biofilm-resistant properties may be particularly beneficial in tissue regeneration applications. This study investigated the ability to customize the fatty acid attachment by acyl chlorides to include antimicrobial 2-decenoic acid. Synthesis of 2-decenoyl chloride was followed by acylation of electrospun chitosan membranes in pyridine. Physicochemical properties were characterized through scanning electron microscopy, FTIR, contact angle, and thermogravimetric analysis. The ability of membranes to resist biofilm formation by S. aureus and P. aeruginosa was evaluated by direct inoculation. Cytocompatibility was evaluated by adding membranes to cultures of NIH3T3 fibroblast cells. Acylation with chlorides stabilized nanofibers in aqueous media without significant swelling of fibers and increased hydrophobicity of the membranes. Acyl-modified membranes reduced both S. aureus and P.aeruginosa bacterial biofilm formation on membrane while also supporting fibroblast growth. Acylated chitosan membranes may be useful as wound dressings, guided regeneration scaffolds, local drug delivery, or filtration.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacylation 3abiofilm 3achitosan 3achlorides 3acontact angle 3adrugs 3afatty acids 3afibroblasts 3afiltration 3ahydrophobicity 3ananofibers 3apyridines 3athermogravimetry 3atissue repair1 aColeman, Emily Carol1 aYeasmin, Rabeta 1 aHarrison, Zoe Lynn1 aKurakula, Mallesh 1 aBaker, Daniel L.1 aBumgardner, Joel David1 aFujiwara, Tomoko 1 aJennings, J.

Topographic microsites are known to enhance seed germination and seedling establishment due to their unique soil properties and provision of shelter from elements and herbivores; soil amendments can supply organic matter and nutrients for plant establishment and growth when limited. We investigated the effect of three topographic microsites and six soil amendments and their additive effects on three disturbed grasslands in central and southern Alberta, Canada. Treatments were topographic microsites of mounds, pits, and flats, with and without amendments (erosion control blanket, hay, straw, manure, hydrogel, control) and were seeded with four native grasses and three native forb species. Seedling emergence and survival and soil temperature and water content were assessed over two seasons and plant cover over three seasons. The effect of microsites and amendments was not additive. The addition of erosion control blanket, hay, and straw to flat sites was just as productive as on topographic microsites. These amendments increased grass and forb emergence and buffered soil temperature. Mounds increased first year forb emergence and reduced over winter survival rates for grasses and forbs. Pits were not beneficial for revegetation. The effect of topographic microsites and amendments was influenced by site conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadditive effect 3aerosion control 3aforbs 3agrasses 3agrasslands 3ahay 3aherbivores 3ahydrogels 3aindigenous species 3aland restoration 3anutrients 3aorganic matter 3aoverwintering 3aplant establishment 3aseed germination 3aseedling emergence 3asoil amendments 3asoil temperature 3astraw 3asurvival rate 3atopography 3awater content 3aAlberta 0aamendment 0aemergence 0agrassland 0amulch 0arestoration 0arevegetation1 aCohen Fernández, Anayansi C.1 aMollard, Federico P.O.1 aYao, Linjun1 aWilkinson, Sarah R.1 aJiao, Zhichao0 tRangeland ecology & management.g2018 Jan., v. 71, no. 1 p.12-18dElsevier Inc.aThe Society for Range ManagementwJournal:jnl44569x1550-74247nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rama.2017.08.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03369naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245010700165300001200272520136400284592002801648596008501676596005301761596005901814596010901873596006801982596005902050650001302109650001502122650002002137650001202157650001302169650003102182650001702213650001802230650001802248650001602266650001402282650001102296650003502307650001602342650002102358650001002379700001402389700005702403700001802460700001502478700001302493700001802506700001802524700001602542773014202558856008202700852000902782655001202791IND60673904520221121120726.0191128e201911  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067390452DNAL7 a10.1007/s11270-019-4297-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDai, Chaomeng10aTiO2 and SiO2 Nanoparticles Combined with Surfactants Mitigate the Toxicity of Cd2+ to Wheat Seedlings  ap. 232.  aEngineered nanoparticles (NPs) could be coated by surfactants and modify the bioavailability and toxicity of heavy metals. In this study, the single and combined effect of sodium dodecyl benzene sulfonate (SDBS) and NPs on the toxicities of Cd²⁺ to wheat seedlings was investigated by a root elongation, and the underlying influence mechanism was further discussed. The results showed that the presence of SDBS improved the Cd²⁺ adsorption capacity of TiO₂ and SiO₂ NPs. The reaction of SDBS and TiO₂ and SiO₂NPs could increase TiO₂ and SiO₂ NPs dispersion stability and produced more available adsorption sites. The adsorption coefficients of Cd²⁺ on TiO₂ and SiO₂ NPs were enhanced from 3.84 to 4.52 mg/g and from 4.51 to 7.16 mg/g after SDBS coating. Both SDBS-coated TiO₂ and SDBS-coated SiO₂ NPs reduced Cd²⁺ phytotoxicity. The presence of bare TiO₂ and SiO₂ NPs at 1000 mg/L promoted root length of the wheat seedlings by 31.2% and 39.3%; however, SDBS-coated TiO₂ and SiO₂ NPs increased the root length by 41.2% and 51.4%, which demonstrated that SDBS-coated NPs had a much better effect on reducing the toxicity of Cd²⁺ than bare NPs. The results indicated the mitigation of Cd²⁺ toxicity was due to a decrease in bioavailable soluble Cd²⁺ which was adsorbed by NPs through electrostatic attraction.  aPublisher supplied data  a2019010202cFund of Peak Discipline from Shanghai Municipal Education Commission  a19ZR1459300cShanghai Natural Science Foundation  a41601514cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a0200121005/053cInterdisciplinarity Fund of Peak Discipline from Shanghai Municipal Education Commission  aPPC2016019cState Key Laboratory of Petroleum Pollution Control  a41471392cNational Natural Science Foundation of China 3aTriticum 3aadsorption 3abioavailability 3acadmium 3acoatings 3aelectrostatic interactions 3aheavy metals 3ananoparticles 3aphytotoxicity 3aroot growth 3aseedlings 3asilica 3asodium dodecylbenzenesulfonate 3asurfactants 3atitanium dioxide 3awheat1 aShen, Hui1 aDuan, Yanping1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3241-98531 aLiu, Shuguang1 aZhou, Feng1 aWu, Deli1 aZhong, Guihui1 aJavadi, Akbar1 aTu, Yao-Jen0 tWater, air, and soil pollution.g2019 Nov., v. 230, no. 11 p.232-232dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:jnl4876x0049-69797nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11270-019-4297-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02625naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002700140245007100167520143600238592002801674650001601702650001801718650001601736650001601752650001101768650001801779650001701797650001101814650002301825650001501848650001701863650001301880650001501893700002301908700003001931700002301961700001901984773012802003856007502131852000902206655001202215IND60754280820221123025632.0211023e20210923xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075428082DNAL7 a10.3390/md191005312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aÁvila-Román, Javier 10aAnti-Inflammatory and Anticancer Effects of Microalgal Carotenoids  aAcute inflammation is a key component of the immune system’s response to pathogens, toxic agents, or tissue injury, involving the stimulation of defense mechanisms aimed to removing pathogenic factors and restoring tissue homeostasis. However, uncontrolled acute inflammatory response may lead to chronic inflammation, which is involved in the development of many diseases, including cancer. Nowadays, the need to find new potential therapeutic compounds has raised the worldwide scientific interest to study the marine environment. Specifically, microalgae are considered rich sources of bioactive molecules, such as carotenoids, which are natural isoprenoid pigments with important beneficial effects for health due to their biological activities. Carotenoids are essential nutrients for mammals, but they are unable to synthesize them; instead, a dietary intake of these compounds is required. Carotenoids are classified as carotenes (hydrocarbon carotenoids), such as α- and β-carotene, and xanthophylls (oxygenate derivatives) including zeaxanthin, astaxanthin, fucoxanthin, lutein, α- and β-cryptoxanthin, and canthaxanthin. This review summarizes the present up-to-date knowledge of the anti-inflammatory and anticancer activities of microalgal carotenoids both in vitro and in vivo, as well as the latest status of human studies for their potential use in prevention and treatment of inflammatory diseases and cancer.  aPublisher supplied data 3aastaxanthin 3acanthaxanthin 3afood intake 3ahomeostasis 3ahumans 3aimmune system 3ainflammation 3alutein 3amarine environment 3amicroalgae 3atherapeutics 3atoxicity 3azeaxanthin1 aGarcía-Gil, Sara 1 aRodríguez-Luna, Azahara 1 aMotilva, Virginia 1 aTalero, Elena 0 tMarine drugs.g2021 Sept. 23, v. 19, no. 10dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21403x1660-33977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/md191005313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01666naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002300143245007800166300001600244520071700260592002800977650000801005650002801013650001701041650001601058650001601074700002201090700002701112773013901139856007701278852000901355655001201364IND60523996820221121161429.0160701e20080930xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052399682DNAL7 a10.5586/asbp.2008.0252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKwiatkowska, Maria10aDNA level in guard cells nuclei of Ornithogalum umbellatum ovary is 2C-4C  ap. 207-211.  aThe DNA content after Feulgen reaction in the guard cells and epidermis of Omithogalum umbellatum ovary was cytophotometrically measured in different phases of flower development. Only in bud of flowers guard cells DNA content was 2C while in full blown flowers it was higher, between 2C-4C. This observation was supported by autoradiographic studies with 3H-thymidine which was incorporated into guard cell nuclei in the ovary epidermis of newly developed flowers. Thus DNA level in O. umbellatum guard cells was higher than those in other plants described in literature.

Many higher education institutions, responsible for equipping the next generation of sustainability leaders with knowledge and essential skills, proactively try to action the sustainable development goals (SDGs) in HEfSD policy, curriculum and practice through scattered and isolated initiatives. Yet, these attempts are not strategically supported by a governing approach to HEfSD or coordinated effectively to tackle social and environmental sustainability. These predicaments not only widen the gap between HEfSD policy, curriculum and practice but also exacerbate the complexities between human and environmental interactions compromising overall sustainability. However, these efforts represent a potential for actioning the Global Agenda for Sustainable Development. Based on a qualitative research strategy, theory building methodology and various methodological techniques (surveys, policy and literature review, group and individual interviews), this research suggests that the advancement of HEfSD in policy, curriculum and practice depends largely on a better understanding of existing gaps, target areas, commonalities and differences across regional HEfSD agendas. This will hopefully provide higher education institutions and their stakeholders across regions with some conceptual and practical tools to consider strategically how HEfSD can successfully be integrated into policy, curriculum and practice in alignment with SDGs and with the overall mandate of the Global Agenda for Sustainable Development.  aPublisher supplied data  aJP17777cJapan Society for the Promotion of Science (JP) 3acurriculum 3aeducational institutions 3ahigher education 3ahumans 3ainterviews 3aissues and policy 3aqualitative analysis 3aresearch planning 3astakeholders 3asurveys 3asustainability science and engineering 3asustainable development1 aSaito, O.1 aVaughter, P.1 aWhereat, J.1 aKanie, N.1 aTakemoto, K.0 tSustainability science.g2019 Nov., v. 14, no. 6 p.1621-1642dSpringer JapanwJournal:J000001136x1862-40657nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11625-018-0628-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01669naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245007300170300001400243520061200257592002800869650001100897650001300908650000800921650001100929650001400940651001800954651001800972653002000990653001101010653001301021653002201034653001801056700002101074773010601095856008501201852000901286655001201295IND60567334120221121062747.0180904e20170720xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056733412DNAL7 a10.1016/j.quaint.2017.03.0622doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDawe, Robert J.10aNunataks and valley glaciers: Over the mountains and through the ice  ap. 56-71.  aModels of the first peopling of the Americas characterize arrival routes either along the coast or through the ice-free corridor following the Last Glacial Maximum.

We argue that the traditionally envisioned corridor is an unnecessary feature for the terrestrial arrival of Clovis or Clovis predecessors below the ice sheets.

Here, we present a complete 1-year data series of dendrometer measurements and synchronous meteorological records. The mean daily radius change index curve obtained by first-difference standardization was analyzed. The results indicate strong similarities of stem radius variations among the studied trees. By graphical inspection of sub-diurnal shrinkage and expansion patterns, seasonal stem radius variations could be divided into two general phases. During early winter to spring, daily amplitudes show strong fluctuations, and meteorological data indicate that both air and soil temperatures are positively related to stem radius swelling. From late March to early November 2011, stem radius expansion is negatively related to both air and soil temperatures, as well as to vapor pressure deficit, and positively related to precipitation and soil moisture. We found that the dividing lines between the two phases were strongly linked to the occurrence of a 0 °C daily mean air temperature, indicating that air temperature played an important effect on stem radius variations in this cold and arid environment. During the growing season in 2011, May and June are the most productive months.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair temperature 3agrowing season 3ameteorological data 3amountains 3ashrinkage 3asoil air 3asoil temperature 3asoil water 3avapor pressure 3awinter 3aChina1 aYang, Bao1 aDeslauriers, Annie1 aQin, Chun1 aHe, Minhui1 aShi, Feng1 aLiu, Jingjing0 tTrees.g2012 Dec., v. 26, no. 6 p.1747-1757dSpringer-Verlagx0931-18907nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00468-012-0743-2  aDNAL 7aarticle02659naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001300152245015900165300001600324520135100340592002801691650002401719650001801743650002401761650001601785650001301801653002901814653002101843653002901864653001601893653003401909700001501943700001501958700002001973700002201993700001902015700001902034773010102053856008602154852000902240655001202249IND60562600820221118060137.0170719e20170415xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056260082DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enconman.2017.01.0682doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGuo, Wei10aConstruction and experimental verification of a novel flexible thermal control system configuration for the autonomous on-orbit services of space missions  ap. 273-285.  aThis paper proposed a novel flexible thermal control system (F-TCS) configuration for realizing thermal management for spacecrafts autonomous on-orbit service (A-OOS) demands. With a dual-ring topology which composes of a heat collecting bus, a heat dissipating bus, connection brunches and inter-platform service interfaces, the F-TCS may realize not only self-reconfiguration operations but also providing heat dissipation resources for other spacecrafts or cabins. The F-TCS hydraulic and thermal dynamics were modeled, a verification testbed was also established to validate the F-TCS thermal control performance. Focused on investigating the self-reconfiguration and thermal control cooperative operations, several typical A-OOS cases were imposed on the F-TCS, numerical simulations and experimental validations were respectively implemented. Both results demonstrated that the meticulously designed F-TCS is capable of offering self-topological reconfiguration with fast time response and robust temperature control performances, high systemic heat transfer efficiency is also recommended from the point of view of energy saving. The F-TCS is suggested as a promising solution for A-OOS owing to its higher reliability and promising autonomous maintenance potential which is suitable for future spacecrafts thermal management requirements.  aPublisher supplied data 3aenergy conservation 3aheat transfer 3amathematical models 3atemperature 3atopology 0aFlexible thermal control 0aOn-orbit service 0aTopology reconfiguration 0aReliability 0aSpacecraft thermal management1 aLi, Yunhua1 aLi, Yun-Ze1 aWang, Sheng-Nan1 aZhong, Ming-Liang1 aWang, Ji-Xiang1 aZhang, Jia-Xun0 tEnergy conversion and management.g2017 Apr. 15, v. 138 p.273-285dElsevier Ltdx0196-89047nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enconman.2017.01.0683Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01972naa a2200253 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002500143245008200168300001600250520113900266592002801405650001501433650001001448650001201458650001101470773013901481856007701620852000901697655001201706IND60523997020221121091529.0160701e20080930xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052399702DNAL7 a10.5586/asbp.2008.0272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKołodziejek, Jeremi10aHair types in Polish selected taxa of Potentilla subsect.

P. thyrsiflora Hillsen ex Zimmeter, P. wimanniana Gilnther and Schummel, P. leucopolitana P.J. Milller and P. leucopolitana P.J. Milller x P. incana P. Graebner were studied. A total of five unicellular hair types could be distinguished, based on the structure of the hair: straight, involuted, crispate, curved and stellate. The occurrence of involuted, curved and stellate hairs was observed for the first time for the majority of investigated taxa. There is a variation in density, position, as well as in the number of arms of stellate hairs. Although they are difficult to see without a stereo microscope, these differences seem to be systematically important. The study of hair types on surfaces of leaves supports the opinion that P. collina s.lato is a hybrid between P. argentea L. s.la-to, P. tabernaemontani Ascherson and P. incana P. Gaertner. Hairs form consistent characters which are highly suited for systematic purposes. The key to Polish taxa based on leaf hair types is given as well.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPotentilla 3ahairs 3ahybrids 3aleaves0 tActa Societatis Botanicorum Poloniae.g2008 Sept. 30, v. 77, no. 3 p.217-224dPolish Botanical SocietywJournal:12967x0001-69777nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.5586/asbp.2008.0273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03239naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245010000165506011700265506007600382520144000458592002801898506003701926650002001963650002401983650001902007650001302026650001302039650001702052650001802069650001802087650001802105650001902123650002602142650000902168650001802177650001602195650004402211650000702255650001802262653003502280653001702315653001302332653002102345700001502366700001802381700001202399700001902411700005402430773010902484856008302593852000902676655001202685IND60794702420221207060942.0221004e202212  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079470242DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fhfh.2022.1000922doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhao, Xueqin10aSynthesis of N, N, N-trimethyl chitosan-based nanospheres for the prolonged release of curcumin  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aIt is critical to develop a hydrophilic drug carrier with positive charge on the surface to enhance the bioavailability of curcumin to overcome the tissue barrier, e.g., blood brain barrier. In this paper, a quaternized chitosan derivative, N,N,N-Trimethyl Chitosan (TMC) was produced which is a cationic polysaccharide. Nuclear magnetic resonance (¹H-NMR) and Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) have been used to verify the synthesis of TMC. A simple nanoemulsion process has been developed to produce TMC-based nanosphere to load curcumin. A high encapsulation efficiency (over 90%) can be observed. The average particle size of nanospheres made of TMC with 2.5 mg/mL and 4.0 mg/ mL is estimated at 555.3±117.7 nm and 771.2±123.2 nm, respectively. The effect of the concentrations of TMC on the release profile has been investigated. It is found that nanospheres made of a higher concentration of TMC, 4.0 mg/mL, could lead to an extended release of curcumin, and the first-order release kinetics can be observed when release time increases from 0 to 265 h. The release kinetics of curcumin loaded in TMC nanospheres is also influenced by pH value. In addition, the cytotoxicity study shows that no toxic effect can be found when cells are treated with synthetic TMC. The relative cell viability of mouse cardiac endothelial cells treated with curcumin loaded TMC nanospheres is higher than that when cells treated with curcumin alone.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abioavailability 3ablood-brain barrier 3acell viability 3achitosan 3acurcumin 3acytotoxicity 3adrug carriers 3aencapsulation 3ahydrocolloids 3ahydrophilicity 3ainfrared spectroscopy 3amice 3ananoemulsions 3ananospheres 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3apH 3aparticle size 0aN, N, N-trimethylated chitosan 0aNanoemulsion 0aCurcumin 0aRelease kinetics1 aLü, Chao,1 aYang, Songlin1 aNi, Rui1 aPeng, Tianqing1 aZhang, Jin1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6875-80080 tFood hydrocolloids for health.g2022 Dec., v. 2 p.100092-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:28426x2667-02597nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fhfh.2022.1000923Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02740naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001900152245015800171500002200329520142300351592002801774650001501802650001701817650002201834650001501856650000901871650002001880650001801900650001101918650001301929650001001942653004501952653003001997653001802027653002402045653003002069700005902099773007702158856008602235852000902321655001202330IND60562600920221118060129.0170719s2017    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056260092DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enconman.2017.01.0802doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSalimi, Mohsen10aModeling, simulation, parametric study and economic assessment of reciprocating internal combustion engine integrated with multi-effect desalination unit  aPre-press version  aDue to thermal nature of multi-effect desalination (MED), its integration with a suitable power cycle is highly desirable for waste heat recovery. One of the proper power cycle for proposed integration is internal combustion engine (ICE). The exhaust gas heat of ICE is used to produce motive steam for the required heat for the first effect of MED system. Also, the water jacket heat is utilized in a heat exchanger to pre-heat the seawater. This paper studies a thermodynamic model for a tri-generation system composed of ICE integrated with MED. The ICE thermodynamic model has been used in place of different empirical efficiency relations to estimate performance – load curves reasonably. The entire system performance has been coded in MATLAB, and the results of proposed thermodynamic model for the engine have been verified by manufacturer catalogue. By increasing the engine load from 40% to 100%, the water production of MED unit will increase from 4.38 cubic meters per day to 26.78 cubic meters per day and the tri-generation efficiency from 31% to 56%. Economic analyses of the MED unit integrated with ICE was performed based on Annualized Cost of System method. This integration makes the system more economical. It has been determined that in higher market prices for fresh water (more than 7 US$ per cubic meter), the increase in effects number is more significant to the period of return decrement.  aPublisher supplied data 3acombustion 3adesalination 3aeconomic analysis 3afreshwater 3aheat 3aheat exchangers 3amarket prices 3amodels 3aseawater 3asteam 0aReciprocating internal combustion engine 0aMulti-effect Desalination 0aHeat recovery 0aThermal integration 0aAnnualized Cost of System1 aAmidpour, Majid1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2073-61060 tEnergy conversion and management.g2017, dElsevier Ltdx0196-89047nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enconman.2017.01.0803Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02198naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245005900166300001600225500001500241520091000256592002801166650002501194650002601219650001301245650002001258650000901278650001601287650001601303650001701319650002201336650001101358650000901369650001001378650001101388650002301399650002301422650002301445650001101468653001301479700002101492773013601513856008201649852000901731655001201740IND50069701320221118021035.0190411e201310  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006970132DNAL7 a10.1016/j.pbi.2013.06.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVoesenek, LACJ10aFlooding tolerance: O2 sensing and survival strategies  ap. 647-653.  a2019-12-06  aThe investigation of flooding survival strategies in model, crop and wild plant species has yielded insights into molecular, physiological and developmental mechanisms of soil flooding (waterlogging) and submergence survival. The antithetical flooding escape and quiescence strategies of deepwater and submergence tolerant rice (Oryza sativa), respectively, are regulated by members of a clade of ethylene responsive factor transcriptional activators. This knowledge paved the way for the discovery that these proteins are targets of a highly conserved O2-sensing protein turnover mechanism in Arabidopsis thaliana. Further examples of genes that regulate transcription, root and shoot metabolism or development during floods have emerged. With the rapid advancement of genomic technologies, the mining of natural genetic variation in flooding tolerant wild species may ultimately benefit crop production.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3atranscription factors 3aethylene 3acrop production 3arice 3asubmergence 3awild plants 3aOryza sativa 3agenetic variation 3afloods 3asoil 3agenes 3aoxygen 3aflooded conditions 3aprotein metabolism 3aflooding tolerance 3ashoots 0aproteins1 aBailey-Serres, J0 tCurrent opinion in plant biology.g2013 Oct., v. 16, no. 5 p.647-653dElsevier LtdaElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl58157x1369-52667nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.pbi.2013.06.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03283naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002800140245009700168520183400265592002802099650002302127650002502150650001702175650001202192650001602204650001702220650003202237650002202269650002302291650001102314650001402325650002102339650001602360650001502376650002602391700002002417700002402437700001902461700002502480700002102505700002102526700002002547700002202567773012802589856007502717852000902792655001202801IND60754281220221121024957.0211023e20210930xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075428122DNAL7 a10.3390/md191005602doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMessina, Concetta Maria10aAntioxidant Bioactivity of Extracts from Beach Cast Leaves of Posidonia oceanica (L.) Delile  aThe marine environment is a generous source of biologically active compounds useful for human health. In 50 years, about 25,000 bioactive marine compounds have been identified, with an increase of 5% per year. Peculiar feature of algae and plants is the production of secondary metabolites, such as polyphenols, synthesized as a form of adaptation to environmental stress. Posidonia oceanica is a Mediterranean endemic and dominant seagrass and represents a biologically, ecologically and geologically important marine ecosystem. Within this study, methanolic and ethanolic extracts were generated from fresh and dried Posidonia oceanica leaves, with the aim to employ and valorize the beach cast leaves. The best yield and antioxidant activity (polyphenols content equal to 19.712 ± 0.496 mg GAE/g and DPPH IC50 of 0.090 µg/µL.) were recorded in 70% ethanol extracts (Gd-E4) obtained from leaves dried for two days at 60 °C and ground four times. HPLC analyses revealed the presence of polyphenols compounds (the most abundant of which was chicoric acid) with antioxidant and beneficial properties. Bioactive properties of the Gd-E4 extracts were evaluated in vitro using fibroblast cells line (HS-68), subjected to UV induced oxidative stress. Pre-treatment of cells with Gd-E4 extracts led to significant protection against oxidative stress and mortality associated with UV exposure, thus highlighting the beneficial properties of antioxidants compounds produced by these marine plants against photo damage, free radicals and associated negative cellular effects. Beach cast leaves selection, processing and extraction procedures, and the in vitro assay results suggested the potentiality of a sustainable approach for the biotechnological exploitation of this resource and could serve a model for other marine resources.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPosidonia oceanica 3aantioxidant activity 3aantioxidants 3aethanol 3afibroblasts 3ahuman health 3ainhibitory concentration 50 3amarine ecosystems 3amarine environment 3amodels 3amortality 3aoxidative stress 3apolyphenols 3aseagrasses 3asecondary metabolites1 aArena, Rosaria 1 aManuguerra, Simona 1 aPericot, Yann 1 aCurcuraci, Eleonora 1 aKerninon, Fanny 1 aRenda, Giuseppe 1 aHellio, Claire 1 aSantulli, Andrea 0 tMarine drugs.g2021 Sept. 30, v. 19, no. 10dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21403x1660-33977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/md191005603Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02874naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100005500150245010700205300001600312520156500328592002801893650001101921650000901932650001801941650001301959650001901972650001501991650002402006650001102030650001402041650002402055650001402079650001902093651001002112651001002122651002102132651001702153700001802170700001902188700001902207773010802226856008502334852000902419655001202428IND60567334420221121053138.0180904e20171130xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056733442DNAL7 a10.1016/j.quaint.2017.04.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aUm, In Kwon1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0191-823010aProvenance of late Quaternary sediments on the southwestern slope of the Ulleung Basin, East/Japan Sea  ap. 153-164.  aThe provenance of fine-grained sediments deposited since the late Quaternary was recovered from drill site UBGH2-1_1 on the southwestern slope of the Ulleung Basin, East/Japan Sea. Based on geochemical analyses, including rare earth elements (REEs), the fine-grained sediments could be interpreted as mixtures of sediments from China via various pathways and sediments discharged from the Nakdong River (NRS). A comparison of variations in REE fractionation factor with Marine Isotope Stages (MISs) indicated that the provenance of the fine-grained sediments on the southwestern slope of the Ulleung Basin was controlled by global eustatic sea-level change. During glacial periods, most of the fine-grained sediments were supplied via the atmospheric pathway by an intensified East Asian Winter Monsoon, and sediments from Chinese rivers (CRS) transported into the Ulleung Basin through the Korea Strait were limited due to the morphological characteristics of the Korea Strait and low sea-level. During interglacial periods, The CRS transported into the Ulleung Basin through the Korea Strait increased with sea-level rise and eolian dust inputs decreased due to attenuated East Asian Winter Monsoon. Simultaneously, NRS also should have been deposited when sea-level was higher than −40 m relative to present sea-level during MIS 1 and MIS 5. In particular, during MIS 1, signals of NRS were revealed since 11 ka; thus, it can be suggested that the present coastal current system around the southeastern coast of Korea became established by around 11 ka.  aPublisher supplied data 3acoasts 3adust 3afractionation 3aisotopes 3amonsoon season 3aprovenance 3arare earth elements 3arivers 3asea level 3asediment deposition 3asediments 3awater currents 3aChina 3aJapan 3aKorean Peninsula 3aSea of Japan1 aChoi, Man Sik1 aBahk, Jang Jun1 aChun, Jong Hwa0 tQuaternary international.g2017 Nov. 30, v. 459 p.153-164dElsevier LtdwJournal:12411x1040-61827nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.quaint.2017.04.0133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02678naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001400150245008200164300001600246520154600262592002801808650002001836650001401856650001701870650003101887650001201918650001001930650001901940653001601959653001901975653001701994653001802011653000902029653001902038653001702057700001302074773009902087856008502186852000902271655001202280IND60609699020221122090957.0181010e201710  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060969902DNAL7 a10.1016/j.powtec.2017.07.0792doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFan, Long10aStudy on laminar flow containing fibre particles in a stirred tank using DPIV  ap. 420-427.  aSolid-liquid two-phase flow is often encountered in stirred tanks. However, for the sake of simplicity, solid particles are usually taken as spherical particles. As to non-spherical particles in stirred tanks, seldom literature is involved. In this paper, the experiments about fibre particles in laminar flow are performed with the help of digital Particle Image Velocimetry (DPIV). The emphasis of this work is to measure velocity and orientations of fibre particles simultaneously in a stirred tank. Fibre particles with different aspect ratios of 18.8, 25.0 and 37.5 are experimented with Reynolds number (Re) varying from 4.5 to 13.6, respectively. The orientations of particles at various locations under different laminar conditions are obtained. In addition, the influences of impeller speed, solid concentration and aspect ratio of fibre particles on orientations are discussed. The results show that both the radial and axial velocities increase with the increase of impeller speed, while velocities rarely have any variation with the aspect ratio. On the contrast, the influence of the aspect ratio on orientation is obvious and sharp. The angle between the particle and the horizontal plane decreases with the increasing aspect ratio. Meanwhile, orientations of fibre particle in laminar flow are also compared with those in turbulent flow with Re=1.25×10⁴. The orientations in laminar flow are larger than those in turbulent flow under the same conditions. All these will benefit the design and scale-up of related equipment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aReynolds number 3aimpellers 3alaminar flow 3aparticle image velocimetry 3apowders 3atanks 3aturbulent flow 0aOrientation 0aFibre particle 0aSolid-liquid 0aStirred tanks 0aDPIV 0aTurbulent flow 0aLaminar flow1 aXu, Nong0 tPowder technology.g2017 Oct., v. 320 p.420-427dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11732x0032-59107nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.powtec.2017.07.0793Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01392naa a2200301 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003600092040001800128100001900146245012800165300001600293520040600309592002800715650000900743650002300752650001400775650001100789650001300800700001600813700002100829700001700850773012000867852000900987856008200996655001201078IND9001669720221120042101.0181024e198911  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND900166972DNAL7 a10.1177/0040517589059011112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDe La Maza, A.10aPhysicochemical Properties of Hercosett / Optical Brightener Agent Dispersions Applied to Untreated Wool for Shrinkproofing  ap. 687-690.  aHercosett resin was applied to untreated wool samples using dispersions made with a cationic Hercosett resin and different optical brightener agents in order to improve both brightness and shrinkproofing properties.

Understanding strain partitioning between the different fault strands along such sections is key to assessing kinematics and evolution through time of a fault system and related seismic hazards. The Haiyuan fault, one of the longest strike‐slip faults of the Tibetan Plateau, has developed a multi‐stranded complex fault geometry along the Hasi Shan restraining bend. In this study, we quantified the slip rate of the ∼50‐km‐long Zihong Shan fault, which is the poorly‐known southernmost fault strand of the Hasi Shan restraining bend. We computed high‐resolution DEMs and orthophotos to document the offset landforms along this fault using drone surveys. At selected sites with well‐preserved offset geomorphic markers, we quantified displaced terraces and channels using microtopography analysis. We dated the abandonment age of these terraces using ¹⁰Be cosmogenic depth profiles and OSL dating techniques. It yields a left‐lateral slip rate of 1.9 ± 0.6 mm/yr since ∼13 ka, which is similar to the rate of the main Hasi Shan branch that ruptured during the 1920 Haiyuan earthquake. The minimum total horizontal slip rate system summed over the multiple strands of the Haiyuan fault at the Hasi Shan restraining bend is 4.1 ± 0.6 mm/yr, without considering the vertical deformation rate of these fault strands. The rate is thus slightly smaller than, but comparable to, slip‐rates determined along the rest of the Haiyuan fault, east and west of the Hasi Shan restraining bend.  aPublisher supplied data  aU1839203cThe National Natural Science Fundation of China  a41802228cThe National Natural Science Fundation of China  aLED2017A01cThe State Key Laboratory of Earthquake Dynamic of Chinas  aANR‐18‐CE31‐0012cANR project DISRUPT 3adeformation 3aearthquakes 3ageometry 3ageophysics 3akinematics 3alandforms 3amicrorelief 3aorthophotography 3aresearch 3aChina1 aLiu‐Zeng, Jing1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7108-64521 aKlinger, Yann1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2119-63911 aWang, Zijun1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9296-79531 aShao, Yanxiu1 aHan, Longfei1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4909-49601 aWang, Wei1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3227-48851 aZhang, Jinyu1 aLiu, Zhijun0 tJournal of geophysical research.g2022 May, v. 127, no. 5 p.e2021JB023162-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:27943x2169-93137nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2021JB0231623Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02712naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002000140245007100160520149900231592002801730650001301758650001901771650002101790650001401811650001101825650001501836650002401851650001601875650001401891650001101905650001101916650001701927700002201944700001601966700002001982700002302002700001902025700003502044773012702079856007502206852000902281655001202290IND60754281420221121025003.0211023e20211005xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075428142DNAL7 a10.3390/md191005622doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMackieh, Rawan 10aVoltage-Gated Sodium Channels: A Prominent Target of Marine Toxins  aVoltage-gated sodium channels (VGSCs) are considered to be one of the most important ion channels given their remarkable physiological role. VGSCs constitute a family of large transmembrane proteins that allow transmission, generation, and propagation of action potentials. This occurs by conducting Na⁺ ions through the membrane, supporting cell excitability and communication signals in various systems. As a result, a wide range of coordination and physiological functions, from locomotion to cognition, can be accomplished. Drugs that target and alter the molecular mechanism of VGSCs’ function have highly contributed to the discovery and perception of the function and the structure of this channel. Among those drugs are various marine toxins produced by harmful microorganisms or venomous animals. These toxins have played a key role in understanding the mode of action of VGSCs and in mapping their various allosteric binding sites. Furthermore, marine toxins appear to be an emerging source of therapeutic tools that can relieve pain or treat VGSC-related human channelopathies. Several studies documented the effect of marine toxins on VGSCs as well as their pharmaceutical applications, but none of them underlined the principal marine toxins and their effect on VGSCs. Therefore, this review aims to highlight the neurotoxins produced by marine animals such as pufferfish, shellfish, sea anemone, and cone snail that are active on VGSCs and discuss their pharmaceutical values.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAnthozoa 3aTetraodontidae 3aanalgesic effect 3acognition 3ahumans 3alocomotion 3amechanism of action 3aneurotoxins 3ashellfish 3asnails 3asodium 3atherapeutics1 aAbou-Nader, Rita 1 aWehbe, Rim 1 aMattei, César 1 aLegros, Christian 1 aFajloun, Ziad 1 aSabatier, J.- M.q(Jean-Marc),0 tMarine drugs.g2021 Oct. 05, v. 19, no. 10dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21403x1660-33977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/md191005623Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03397naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001600155245010900171500002200280520181500302592002802117650001502145650001102160650001602171650001702187650001302204650001802217650001402235650003002249650003402279650002602313650000902339650001802348650001802366650003202384650001302416651001202429653003902441653002502480653001602505653001502521653002802536653002102564700002402585700002002609700002502629700002202654700002502676773005602701856008902757852000902846655001202855IND60532086220221119225812.0160726s2016    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053208622DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2016.07.0562doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMumbo, John14aThe fingerprints of dioxin-like bromocarbazoles and chlorocarbazoles in selected forest soils in Germany  aPre-press version  aThe occurrence of bromocarbazoles and chlorocarbazoles was studied in 86 forest soil samples from different regions in Germany. Carbazole, 3-chlorocarbazole, 3-bromocarbazole and 3,6-dibromocarbazole were qualitatively detected in the humic layer of 59 soil samples with bromocarbazoles reported here for the first time in soil. Furthermore, the halogenated carbazoles, PCDD/Fs and PCBs were detected in the humic and mineral soil horizons (0–5 cm and 5–10 cm) of a subset of 11 soil samples subjected to quantitative analysis. Concentrations ranged from 0.6 to 267.6 ng/g (carbazole); 0.2–7.2 ng/g (3-bromocarbazole); 0.0–9.1 ng/g (3-chlorocarbazole); 0.2–19.8 ng/g (3,6-dibromocarbazole); 0.4–67.6 ng/g (3,6-dichlorocarbazole); 0.0–0.7 ng/g (PCDDs); 0.0–0.3 ng/g (PCDFs) and 0.0–33.7 ng/g (PCBs). Concentrations decreased with depth and correlated positively to total organic carbon (TOC). When it was based on TOC%, an increase in concentration with depth was observed in most soil samples. With respect to dioxin-like toxicity, 3-bromocarbazole, 3-chlorocarbazole, 3,6-dibromocarbazole and 3,6-dichlorocarbazoles caused induction of CYP1A1-dependent EROD activity in HII4E rat hepatoma cell line. Their relative effect potency after 72 h exposure ranged from 0.00005 to 0.00013 and was directly related to the degree of halogenation with 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin as reference. Furthermore, their contribution to overall soil dioxin-like toxicity was not significant in comparison to PCDD/Fs and PCBs though the sum toxic equivalency was limited to three halogenated carbazole congeners. Bromocarbazoles and chlorocarbazoles are emerging dioxin-like toxic environmental contaminants with potential for wide distribution occurring simultaneously with PCDD/Fs and PCBs.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbazoles 3acarbon 3acorrelation 3aforest soils 3ahepatoma 3amineral soils 3apollution 3apolychlorinated biphenyls 3apolychlorinated dibenzofurans 3aquantitative analysis 3arats 3asoil horizons 3asoil sampling 3atetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin 3atoxicity 3aGermany 0aBromocarbazole and chlorocarbazole 0aDioxin-like toxicity 0aForest soil 0aOccurrence 0aRelative effect potency 0aToxic equivalent1 aPandelova, Marchela1 aMertes, Florian1 aHenkelmann, Bernhard1 aBussian, Bernd M.1 aSchramm, Karl-Werner0 tChemosphere.g2016, dElsevier Ltdx0045-65357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2016.07.0563Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02936naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100005900142245009600201500002000297520149900317592002801816596007501844650001701919650001801936650001501954650001301969650001401982650001301996650001502009650002202024651001202046700006102058700005802119700006202177700005902239700001902298773013502317856007702452852000902529655001202538IND60778448220221120212903.0220527e202205  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077844822DNAL7 a10.1029/2021JB0233282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDao, Nghiem Van1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7538-757810aBilateral Heterogeneity in an Upwelling Mantle via Double Subduction of Oceanic Lithosphere  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aVietnam is a major field of Cenozoic volcanism in Southeast (SE) Asia. Two contrasting models have been proposed to explain the mantle upwelling and volcanism in this region; collision of the Indian and Eurasian continents or subduction of the Pacific or Indo‐Australian oceanic lithosphere. To place constraints on the origin of the intraplate volcanism in SE Asia, new geochronological and geochemical data for Cenozoic basalts in Vietnam are presented. Based largely on Sr‐Nd‐Pb isotope systematics, it was found that the sources of basalts from Central and Southern Vietnam are chemically distinct forming a sharp boundary at 13.5°N. The basalts north of the boundary show isotopic features similar to Enriched Mantle type 2 (EM2) ocean island basalts. Whereas the basalts south of the boundary show isotopic features similar to Enriched Mantle type 1 (EM1) ocean island basalts. The EM1 and EM2 basalts display positive Sr anomalies and elevated Pb/Ce and Th/La ratios, respectively. Such features suggest the origins of the sources through the recycling of deeply‐subducted crustal lithologies. Furthermore, subduction of dense oceanic lithosphere can induce a convecting cell in the upper mantle. Therefore, we suggest that the chemically different basalts from Central and Southern Vietnam represent the surface expression of melting in two different convecting cells, one is driven by subduction of the Pacific plate and the other by subduction of the Indo‐Australian plate.  aPublisher supplied data  cMEXT (Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology) 3aCenozoic era 3ageochronology 3ageophysics 3aisotopes 3alithology 3aresearch 3asubduction 3avolcanic activity 3aVietnam1 aKitagawa, Hiroshi1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6492-42081 aNakamura, Eizo1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4399-94431 aKobayashi, Katsura1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1696-14181 aNgo, Thanh Xuan1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7564-52041 aTrinh, Son Hai0 tJournal of geophysical research.g2022 May, v. 127, no. 5 p.e2021JB023328-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:27943x2169-93137nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2021JB0233283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03413naa a2200673 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001500148245012500163300001200288520157200300592002801872650002701900650001601927650001201943650002701955650000901982650001101991650001402002650002002016650003102036650001002067650001302077650002502090650004302115650001202158650000902170650001102179650002002190650002202210650001302232650001902245650001702264653000802281653000702289653000802296653000902304653000702313653001902320653001302339653001802352653002202370700001802392700001302410700001802423700002002441700001802461700001402479700001902493700001902512773009102531856008302622961001302705852000902718655001202727IND60552513820221118012856.0180830e20161030xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055251382DNAL7 a10.1016/j.gene.2016.07.0412doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Juan10aCry1Ab-expressing rice did not influence expression of fecundity-related genes in the wolf spider Pardosa pseudoannulata  ap. 1-7.  aThe impact of Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) toxin proteins on non-target predatory arthropods is not well understood at the cellular and molecular levels. Here, we investigated the potential effects of Cry1Ab expressing rice on fecundity of the wolf spider, Pardosa pseudoannulata, and some of the underlying molecular mechanisms. The results indicated that brown planthoppers (BPHs) reared on Cry1Ab-expressing rice accumulated the Cry toxin and that reproductive parameters (pre-oviposition period, post-oviposition stage, number of eggs, and egg hatching rate) of the spiders that consumed BPHs reared on Bt rice were not different from those that consumed BPHs reared on the non-Bt control rice. The accumulated Cry1Ab did not influence several vitellin (Vt) parameters, including stored energy and amino acid composition, during one generation. We considered the possibility that the Cry toxins exert their influence on beneficial predators via more subtle effects detectable at the molecular level in terms of gene expression. This led us to transcriptome analysis to detect differentially expressed genes in the ovaries of spiders exposed to dietary Cry1Ab and their counterpart control spiders. Eight genes, associated with vitellogenesis, vitellogenin receptor activity, and vitellin membrane formation were not differentially expressed between ovaries from the treated and control spiders, confirmed by qPCR analysis. We infer that dietary Cry1Ab expressing rice does not influence fecundity, nor expression levels of Vt-associated genes in P. pseudoannulata.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacillus thuringiensis 3aFulgoroidea 3aPardosa 3aamino acid composition 3aeggs 3aenergy 3afecundity 3agene expression 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3ahatching 3apredatory arthropods 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3arearing 3arice 3atoxins 3atranscriptomics 3atransgenic plants 3avitellin 3avitellogenesis 3avitellogenin 0aBPH 0aBt 0aDEG 0aqPCR 0aVt 0aCry1Ab protein 0aVitellin 0aTranscriptome 0aP. pseudoannulata1 aPeng, Yuan-De1 aHe, Chao1 aWei, Bao-Yang1 aLiang, Yun-Shan1 aYang, Huilin,1 aWang, Zhi1 aStanley, David1 aSong, Qi-Sheng0 tGene.g2016 Oct. 30, v. 592, no. 1 p.1-7dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6378x0378-11197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gene.2016.07.0413Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/ARS  aDNAL 7aarticle02567naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005900148245011900207300001800326520155700344592002801901596005001929650001701979650001701996650002302013650004302036773011802079856008302197852000902280655001202289IND60673905420221121120658.0220130e201911  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067390542DNAL7 a10.1007/s11625-019-00669-w2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMontana, Jasper1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3405-254910aCo-production in action: perceiving power in the organisational dimensions of a global biodiversity expert process  ap. 1581-1591.  aOpening up knowledge–action systems to a wider range of disciplinary and societal actors is considered to be a necessary step in achieving transformative change for sustainability. In science for sustainability, there is a growing body of experience and literature of putting this ‘co-production’ into action. However, there is an opportunity to strengthen the application of analytical resources for more explicitly recognising and accounting for the power relations embedded in these initiatives. This paper deploys social theory from science and technology studies to develop an approach to perceive power relations between the participants, processes and products of co-production. This necessitates paying attention to the multiple and distributed organisational spaces where co-production takes place to discern: who participates; who (and what) is represented; how deliberations are structured; and how outcomes are circulated. This paper shows that these organisational dimensions of participation, representation, deliberation, and circulation not only give structure to co-productive forums, but can also define the power relations between their participants, processes and products. The paper then illustrates the applicability of this approach using the case of a current global expert process for biodiversity: The Intergovernmental Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES). This case study offers insights on the challenges and opportunities for designing and evaluating co-production initiatives for sustainability.  aPublisher supplied data  a1362673cEconomic and Social Research Council 3abiodiversity 3acase studies 3aecosystem services 3asustainability science and engineering0 tSustainability science.g2019 Nov., v. 14, no. 6 p.1581-1591dSpringer JapanwJournal:J000001136x1862-40657nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11625-019-00669-w3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02494naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100005700149245015800206506011700364506007600481520101500557592002801572506003701600650001001637650001701647650002001664650001001684650002401694650002501718650001501743653004001758653001801798653002701816653001701843653001701860700001901877700002001896773010901916856005002025852000902075655001202084IND60794702920221207060916.0220926e202302  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079470292DNAL7 a10.1016/j.atech.2022.1001192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKim, Dongyool1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6779-877210aExploring information uses for the successful implementation of farm management information system: A case study on a paddy rice farm enterprise in Japan  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aRecently, the development of farm management information systems (FMIS) has increased. Although many argue that the use of FMIS can enhance decision making, we still do not fully understand the impact of these systems on the individual and farm levels. Thus, we conducted an eight-month investigation and in-depth interviews with one of the leading paddy rice farm practicing data-driven management with intensive using FMIS in Japan. This study found that information use varies across farming operations activities, and by managers and employees. In addition, the system quality and information quality of FMIS associate with information use. The use of FMIS and information facilitated members in sharing information formally and informally, thereby increasing decision making efficiency and informal mutual adjustment among employees. Likewise, the participative management of employees emerged. We then discuss how the FMIS-enabling information usage might facilitate the complex organizational structure.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aJapan 3acase studies 3afarm management 3afarms 3ainformation systems 3aorganization of work 3arough rice 0aFarm management information systems 0aSmart farming 0aInformation management 0aCoordination 0aRice farming1 aYagi, Hironori1 aKiminami, Akira0 tSmart agricultural technology.g2023 Feb., v. 3 p.100119-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:28528x2772-37557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.atech.2022.100119  aDNAL 7aarticle01423naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245016100163300001800324500001900342520038500361592002800746650000800774650002500782650001300807650001400820650001100834700002000845700002100865773013300886856008101019852000901100655001201109IND60709243020221118064646.0200904e202009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070924302DNAL7 a10.1134/S106193482009018X2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZuev, B.

In the pathogenic bacterium Leptospira interrogans, several redox components have been described, namely, typical 2-Cys peroxiredoxin, a functional thioredoxin system, glutathione synthesis pathway, and methionine sulfoxide reductases. However, until now, information about proteins linked to GSH metabolism has not been reported in this pathogen. Glutaredoxins (Grxs) are GSH-dependent oxidoreductases that regulate and maintain the cellular redox state together with thioredoxins. This work deals with recombinant production at a high purity level, biochemical characterization, and detailed kinetic and structural study of the two Grxs (Lin1CGrx and Lin2CGrx) identified in L. interrogans serovar Copenhageni strain Fiocruz L1-130. Both recombinant LinGrxs exhibited the classical in vitro GSH-dependent 2-hydroxyethyl disulfide and dehydroascorbate reductase activity. Strikingly, we found that Lin2CGrx could serve as a substrate of methionine sulfoxide reductases A1 and B from L. interrogans. Distinctively, only recombinant Lin1CGrx contained a [2Fe2S] cluster confirming a homodimeric structure. The functionality of both LinGrxs was assessed by yeast complementation in null grx mutants, and both isoforms were able to rescue the mutant phenotype. Finally, our data suggest that protein glutathionylation as a post-translational modification process is present in L. interrogans. As a whole, our results support the occurrence of two new redox actors linked to GSH metabolism and iron homeostasis in L. interrogans.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLeptospira interrogans 3abacteria 3adisulfides 3aglutathione 3aglutathione dehydrogenase (ascorbate) 3ahomeostasis 3amethionine 3amolecular weight 3amutants 3apathogens 3aperoxiredoxin 3aphenotype 3apost-translational modification 3aserotypes 3asulfoxides 3athiols 3athioredoxins 3ayeasts 0aLeptospira 0aglutaredoxin 0aGlutathione 0aIron-sulfur cluster 0aRedox metabolism 0aThioredoxin 0a1CGrx 0a2CGrx 0aAhpC 0aDHA 0adi-E-GSSG 0aDTNB 0aDTT 0aGR 0aGrx 0aGSH 0aGSNO 0aGSSG 0aH2O2 0aHClO 0aHEDS 0aMetSO 0aMsrA1 0aMsrA2 0aMsrB 0aP-SH 0aP-SSG 0aTrxR 0aTrx1 aHartman, Matías D.1 aGarcía-Effron, Guillermo1 aGuerrero, Sergio A.1 aIglesias, Alberto A.1 aArias, Diego G.0 tBiochimie.g2022 June, v. 197 p.144-159dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6254x0300-90847nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biochi.2022.02.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03048naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245007300170300001600243520103000259536031901289592002801608596027701636650000901913650001101922650002501933650002301958650001801981650002001999650002302019650001802042650002302060650001102083650001202094650002302106651001202129653002102141653001702162653002202179653002602201653003302227700003002260700002402290700002202314773012402336856008502460852000902545655001202554IND60654112520221121233556.0190722e20190724xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065411252DNAL7 a10.1080/10454446.2019.16401592doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDenver, Sigrid10aConsumer Preferences for ‘Localness’ and Organic Food Production  ap. 668-689.  aWhile organic food is based on well-defined production criteria, the criteria for ‘local’ food are less clear. This study investigates the preferences and trade-offs of distinct consumer segments relative to organic production and several dimensions of local food (sales channel, size of company, and geographical location of animals used in the production). The analysis is based on a quantitative survey of 505 Danish consumers and a choice experiment involving beef salami. Data were analyzed in a principal component and a latent class analysis. We identify five consumer segments whose preferences for organic and local product attributes differed substantially. Most respondents considered geographical proximity in the raising of cattle to be the most important attribute and a third of the consumers were willing to pay a premium for organic salami. The segmentation provides more detailed information about stated consumer behavior than what is typically elicited when considering only average consumer behavior.  aThe research was supported by Organic RDD 2.2 Programme.

We describe here a very simple method, illustrated by photographs, for collecting helminths from the digestive tract of vertebrates. It only requires a few plastic vials, some ethanol and a means to heat water. Basically, the method consists of: (a) the extraction of all organs from the abdominal cavity; (b) opening the digestive system longitudinally; (c) agitate gut and contents in a saline solution (i.e. ca. 9% NaCl or 1/4 sea water in tap water); (d) decant in saline as many times as needed to clean contents; (e) immediately fix parasites in near-boiling saline; (f) discard saline and keep specimens in 95% ethanol. Additional information is given for collecting parasites from fish gills with a similar process. The method will collect most helminths (digeneans, larval cestodes, nematodes, acanthocephalans) from the digestive tract, and monogeneans and isopod and copepod crustaceans from fish gills. The specimens will be suitable for both morphological study and DNA sequencing. The method is simple, fast, inexpensive and can be used by untrained personnel, even in the field without electricity and without a binocular microscope. It can also be used by trained parasitologists who need to expedite treatment of abundant samples.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAcanthocephala 3aCestoda 3aCrustacea 3aNematoda 3aabdominal cavity 3adigestive tract 3aelectricity 3aethanol 3afish 3agills 3ahelminths 3ahuman resources 3amicroscopes 3aphotographs 3aseawater 3asequence analysis 3asodium chloride 3atap water 2aAnimals 2aGastrointestinal Tractxparasitology 2aHelminthsxanatomy & histologyxclassificationxgeneticsxisolation & purification. 2aParasitologyxmethods 2aSpecimen Handlingxmethods 2aVertebratesxparasitology1 aBriand, Marine J.1 aBray, Rodney A.0 tParasitology research.g2012 July, v. 111, no. 1 p.341-351dSpringer-Verlagx0932-01137nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00436-012-2845-6  aDNAL 7aarticle01682naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100002000137245005600157300001600213500002000229520080200249592002801051650002701079650001201106650002001118650001101138650002001149773014301169856007101312852000901383655001201392IND60680207420221119222312.0200104e196508  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068020742DNAL7 a10.2307/12362912doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLukaczer, Moses10aFarmer Participation in the Social Security Program  ap. 813-823.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aOptional coverage of self‐employed farmers under the OASDI program may reduce the proportion of farmers reporting taxable self‐employment income from farming in a given year significantly below the proportion who could report. The original intent of the option—to prevent vagaries in income receipts from affecting continuity of OASDI coverage—may be frustrated for some low income farmers who qualify in a given year to report or not to report. The pressure on them to retain their cash income may bias them toward making the decision not to report in a given year on short‐term grounds. Furthermore, some farmers who could or should report their self‐employment income from farming apparently do not because of misunderstanding or lack of understanding of the law or the regulations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural economics 3afarmers 3afarming systems 3aincome 3aself-employment0 tAmerican journal of agricultural economics.g1965 Aug., v. 47, no. 3 p.813-823dOxford University PresswJournal:jnl44932x0002-90927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2307/12362913Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02107naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001400140245013600154300001800290520076100308592002801069650001901097650001401116650001301130650001701143650001001160650001301170650001401183650001001197650001501207650001901222650001301241650001501254650001601269650001401285700001301299700001701312700001701329700001401346700001901360700001401379700002001393773014101413856007401554852000901628655001201637IND60642563820221119045930.0190507e20170516xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064256382DNAL7 a10.1039/c7ta02923c2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Jian10aCarbon nitride nanosheets as visible light photocatalytic initiators and crosslinkers for hydrogels with thermoresponsive turbidity  ap. 8933-8938.  aGraphitic carbon nitride (g-C₃N₄) has emerged as an active visible-light-driven photo(electro)catalyst. However, the rediscovery of g-C₃N₄ has also spurred enormous interest in other, very versatile applications beyond catalysis. Herein, graphitic carbon nitride nanosheets could be used as photocatalytic initiators and cross-linking sites for the temperature responsive poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) hydrogel without any sacrificial agents or co-initiators. A prototype of a temperature controlled smart window based on the hydrogel composite was made by coating the hydrogel composite onto glass. It is believed that the combination of g-C₃N₄ chemistry and conventional hydrogel or polymer chemistry can lead to further promising applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon nitride 3acatalysts 3acoatings 3acrosslinking 3aglass 3agraphene 3ahydrogels 3alight 3ananosheets 3aphotocatalysis 3apolymers 3aprototypes 3atemperature 3aturbidity1 aAn, Tong1 aChen, Zhihan1 aWang, Zizhao1 aZhou, Han1 aFan, Tongxiang1 aZhang, Di1 aAntonietti, M.,0 tJournal of materials chemistry A.g2017 May 16, v. 5, no. 19 p.8933-8938dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26903x2050-74967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c7ta02923c3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02721naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002900147245003800176300001600214520169100230592002801921650001301949650001601962650001401978650001101992650001302003650001302016650000902029650001702038651001302055651001302068700001902081700001602100700001802116700001402134773009602148856008202244852000902326655001202335IND60772783420221119105149.0220410e20220309xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077278342DNAL7 a10.1163/22941932-000021982doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGasson, Peter C.,d1933-10aWilliam Louis Stern (1926–2021)  ap. 213-215.  aWilliam Louis (Bill) Stern passed away on 1 November 2021 at the age of 95. Bill had a long and illustrious career as a botanist. He was a life member of IAWA. From 1951 to around 1982 his focus was on wood anatomy and then his attentions moved on to orchids, culminating in volume 10 of the Anatomy of the Monocotyledons: Orchidaceae in 2014. Bill’s last major wood publication was the incredibly useful Index Xylariorum III (IX3) in 1988, of which he had published a first version in 1957. There’s a photo in IAWA Bulletin 9(4): 394 of him receiving the first printed copy of IX3 from Pieter Baas in Madison in October 1988. Peter first met Bill at Kew and inherited the task of compiling the next version IX4, quickly realising just how big a task this was, especially since Bill hadn’t had the benefits of email! The latest iteration of IX4 can be found on both the IAWA and GTTN websites. Thirty-three years since IX3 younger wood anatomists may not realise just how influential Bill has been in the wood science world. After spending 1944–1946 in the US Naval Reserve he went to Rutgers University where he gained his BS in 1950 and then the University of Illinois for his MS in 1951 and PhD in botany 1954. From 1953 to 1960 he was instructor and curator and then professor of wood anatomy at Yale University School of Forestry and then moved to the Division of Woods in the Department of Botany at the Smithsonian Institution until 1967 when he became Professor of Botany at the University of Maryland until 1979. The Yale wood collection is now at the USDA Forest Service Forest Products Lab in Madison under the acronym SJRw, in honour of its founder Samuel J.

Here, we offer a solution by incorporating flame retardant-functionalized graphene (PFR-fRGO) into PTCs using a procedure that improves both their flame resistance and thermal conductivity. Briefly, PFR-fRGO was prepared by covalently grafting a polyphosphoramide oligomer (PDMPD) onto the surface of graphene, which was then introduced in situ into epoxy resin/Al₂O₃ (EP/Al₂O₃) composites. As expected, the incorporation of PFR-fRGO not only increased the thermal conduction paths by weakening the settlement of microparticles, but also reduced the interfacial thermal resistance by enhancing interfacial interactions, both of which resulted in an enhancement of the thermal conductivity of the ternary composites. The resultant EP/Al₂O₃/PFR-fRGO composite exhibited a superior flame retarding ability with dramatic decreases being seen in the high peak heat release rate (PHRR), the total heat release (THR) and the total smoke production (TSP), i.e. 53%, 37% and 57%, respectively, when compared to pure epoxy resin. Additionally, a synergistic flame retarding effect was found in the ternary composite compared to the EP/PFR-fRGO and EP/Al₂O₃ composites. The remarkable enhancement in flame retardancy was mainly attributed to the catalytic charring effect of PFR-fRGO and the template effect of Al₂O₃, both of which resulted in the formation of a high strength, thermally stable protective layer in the condensed phase that is able to retard the permeation of heat and volatile degradation products during combustion, slow down the heat release rate and protect the underlying polymer.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaluminum oxide 3achemical bonding 3acombustion 3aelectronic equipment 3aepoxides 3afire hazard 3agraphene 3aheat 3aheat tolerance 3amicroparticles 3apermeability 3apolymers 3asmoke 3athermal conductivity 3athermal stability1 aHu, Ji1 aXue, Yang1 aHe, Chengen1 aZhou, Xingping1 aXie, Xiaolin1 aYe, Yunsheng1 aMai, Yiu-Wing0 tJournal of materials chemistry A.g2017 July 4, v. 5, no. 26 p.13544-13556dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26903x2050-74967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c7ta02934a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03493naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245012400170300001600294520218000310592002802490650002902518650001102547650000902558650001102567650000902578650001902587650001802606650002102624650002102645650001702666650000902683651000902692653003102701653002702732653002002759653002102779700002702800700002002827700001902847773008702866856008502953852000903038655001203047IND60569136520221120093023.0190403e201710  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056913652DNAL7 a10.1016/j.catena.2017.05.0192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKarimi, Alireza10aLithogenic and anthropogenic pollution assessment of Ni, Zn and Pb in surface soils of Mashhad plain, northeastern Iran  ap. 151-162.  aMashhad in northeastern Iran, is a fast-growing metropolitan city which has been faced with a high rate of urbanization and industrial activities during recent decades. Despite the high geological diversity of Mashhad plain, the effect of anthropogenic and lithogenic factors on concentrations of potentially toxic elements (PTEs) in the soil have not yet been documented. The objectives of this study were to investigate spatial distribution, anthropogenic and lithogenic origins, and soil pollution intensity of Ni, Zn and Pb in Mashhad plain. A total of 178 soil samples (0–10cm) were collected across an area of about 1500km2. The aqua-regia extractable concentrations of selected PTEs were determined. Results showed concentration for Ni, Zn, and Pb ranged from 33.3–415.8, 35.4–149, and 19.6–69.1mgkg−1 with mean values of 61.4, 74.1, and 31.6mgkg−1, respectively. Calculated background (median+2MAD) concentrations of Ni, Zn and Pb were 60.1, 78 and 28.6mgkg−1, respectively. Pb concentration in 70% of total soil samples was greater than background value; as for Ni and Zn, this figure was 16% and 35%, respectively. The highest concentration of Ni was found in soils formed on ultramafic rocks, whereas the highest concentrations of Zn and Pb occurred in the urban cities of Mashhad and Chenaran. Maximum pollution indices of Ni, Zn and Pb were 6.39, 1.91, and 2.42 with mean values of 0.94, 0.95, and 1.11, respectively. Spatial distribution maps indicated high concentrations of Pb and Zn in Mashhad and Chenaran. The concentration of these elements measured highest in the center of the city. Ni concentration decreased as the distance from ultramafic rocks increased. Results indicated that Ni concentration in the studied soils was controlled by parent material whereas increasing concentrations of Pb and Zn were under the influence of anthropogenic sources. The spread of urbanization and industrial activities in recent decades seem to be responsible for the contamination of soils by Pb and Zn. Although PI values revealed that the soil was not highly polluted, certain strategies must be considered to prevent further pollution in the future.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanthropogenic activities 3acities 3alead 3anickel 3asoil 3asoil pollution 3asoil sampling 3atoxic substances 3aultramafic rocks 3aurbanization 3azinc 3aIran 0aPotentially toxic elements 0aGeochemical background 0aPollution index 0aUltramafic rocks1 aHaghnia, Gholam Hosain1 aSafari, Tayebeh1 aHadadian, Hadi0 tCatena.g2017 Oct., v. 157 p.151-162dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6271x0341-81627nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.catena.2017.05.0193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02151naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002700153245010500180300001800285520081200303592002801115650001401143650000901157650001201166650001801178650001101196650001401207650001301221650002001234653001201254653001701266653001401283653001701297700002501314700003201339700002801371700002201399700002801421700006301449773010801512856008801620852000901708655001201717IND60613064820221117042138.0190628e201810  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061306482DNAL7 a10.1016/j.marpolbul.2018.08.0532doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGonçalves, Rodrigo A.10aDecadal and spatial variation of Hg concentrations in sediments of a multi-stressor impacted estuary  ap. 1158-1163.  aThe present study has evaluated temporal and spatial mercury trends based on surficial sediment samples and 210Pb-dated sediment profiles.

In the inner part of the bay, the most contaminated region, mercury shows a strong association with sulfide. In the same region, based on the 210Pb results, it was possible to calculate the yearly increment on the Hg concentration in the surface sediment, 0.62 μg kg−1 y−1 to 0.29 μg kg−1 y−1, according to the distance to the bay's main tributary rivers.  aPublisher supplied data 3aestuaries 3alead 3amercury 3aradionuclides 3arivers 3asediments 3asulfides 3awater pollution 0aMercury 0aSepetiba Bay 0aSediments 0a210Pb dating1 aOliveira, Douglas F.1 aFerreira, Pedro Henrique G.1 aRezende, Carlos Eduardo1 aAlmeida, Phellipe1 aLacerda, Luiz Drude de,1 aGodoy, José Marcus1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6135-090X0 tMarine pollution bulletin.g2018 Oct., v. 135 p.1158-1163dElsevier LtdwJournal:12420x0025-326X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.marpolbul.2018.08.0533Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02906naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001400152245013600166300001600302520152600318592002801844650002101872650002101893650001501914650001401929650001701943650001401960650001301974650001701987653002702004653002402031653003802055653005202093700001602145700001202161700001702173700002002190700001602210700001402226773013602240856008702376852000902463655001202472IND60744506820221120054038.0220205e20210901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074450682DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2021.07.0662doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLong, Wei10aState-of-art review on preparation, surface functionalization and biomedical applications of cellulose nanocrystals-based materials  ap. 591-615.  aCellulose nanocrystals (CNCs) are a class of sustainable nanomaterials that are obtained from plants and microorganisms. These naturally derived nanomaterials are of abundant hydroxyl groups, well biocompatibility, low cost and biodegradable potential, making them suitable and promising candidates for various applications, especially in biomedical fields. In this review, the recent advances and development on the preparation, surface functionalization and biomedical applications of CNCs-based materials have been summarized and outlined. The main context of this paper could be divided into the following three parts. In the first part, the preparation strategies based on physical, chemical, enzymatic and combination techniques for preparation of CNCs have been summarized. The surface functionalization methods for synthesis CNCs-based materials with designed properties and functions were outlined in the following section. Finally, the current state about applications of CNCs-based materials for tissue engineering, medical hydrogels, biosensors, fluorescent imaging and intracellular delivery of biological agents have been highlighted. Moreover, current issues and future directions about the above aspects have also pointed out and discussed.

Ultrasound-assisted extraction was applied prior to chromatographic determination of stilbenoids in the extracts, and the stability of stilbenoids under extraction conditions was checked. A fractional experimental design was developed to analyze the influence on the extraction process of seven different extraction variables: temperature, ultrasound amplitude, ultrasonic cycle duration, ultrasonic probe type, time, sample-solvent ratio, and solvent (mixtures of ethanol and water). The most important variables for the recovery of major stilbenoids were studied and the final conditions optimized. With this new method, the main stilbenoids found in grape stems can be extracted in 15 min, using 75 °C as the extraction temperature and 80% ethanol as the extraction solvent, and no cleaning step with organic solvent is needed. The optimized method allowed for the analysis of stilbenoid content from 22 grape stem samples, many of them analyzed for the first time.  aPublisher supplied data 3agrapes 3astems 3aexperimental design 3astilbenoids 3aultrasonics 3achromatography 3atemperature 3acleaning 3aethanol 2aChemical Fractionationxinstrumentationxmethods. 2aPlant Extractsxanalysisxisolation & purification. 2aPlant Stemsxchemistry 2aSonicationxmethods 2aStilbenesxanalysisxisolation & purification. 2aVitisxchemistry 0atrans-resveratrol 0aHPLC 0avitisin-B 0aultrasound-assisted extraction 0amethodology 0anew methods 0agrape stems 0aε-viniferin1 aGuerrero, R.

One of the major unsolved problems in highly developed remote sensing imagery is the manual selection and combination of appropriate features according to spectral and spatial properties. Deep learning framework can learn global and robust features from the training data set automatically, and it has achieved state-of-the-art classification accuracies over different image classification tasks. In this study, a technique is proposed which attempts to classify hyperspectral imagery by incorporating deep learning features. Firstly, deep learning features are extracted by multiscale convolutional auto-encoder. Then, based on the learned deep learning features, a logistic regression classifier is trained for classification. Finally, parameters of deep learning framework are analysed and the potential development is introduced. Experiments are conducted on the well-known Pavia data set which is acquired by the reflective optics system imaging spectrometer sensor. It is found that the deep learning-based method provides a more accurate classification result than the traditional ones.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAesculus 3adata collection 3ahyperspectral imagery 3aimage analysis 3alearning 3aoptics 3aregression analysis 3aremote sensing1 aGuo, Zhou1 aYue, Jun1 aZhang, Xiuyuan1 aLuo, Liqun0 tInternational journal of remote sensing.g2015 July 3, v. 36, no. 13 p.3368-3379dTaylor & Francisx1366-59017nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/2150704X.2015.10621573Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02547naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002800147245011300175300001600288520156400304592002801868650002101896650001001917650001101927650001101938650001301949650001101962650001401973700002601987700002002013773009802033856008102131852000902212655001202221IND60573246020221120111248.0170726e201612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057324602DNAL7 a10.1007/s12080-016-0301-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBrush, Eleanor Redstart14aThe content and availability of information affects the evolution of social-information gathering strategies  ap. 455-476.  aSocial animals can gather information by observing the other members of their groups. Strategies for gathering this type of social information have many components. In particular, an animal can vary the number of other animals it observes. European starlings (Sturnus vulgaris) in flight pay attention to a number of neighbors that allows the flock to reach consensus quickly and robustly. The birds may do this because being in such a flock confers benefits on its members, or the birds may use the strategy that is individually beneficial without regard for the flock’s structure. To understand when individual-level optimization results in a group-level optimum, we develop a model of animals gathering social information about environmental cues, where the cue can be about either predators or resources, and we analyze two processes through which the number of neighbors changes over time. We then identify the number of neighbors the birds use when the two dynamics reach equilibrium. First, we find that the equilibrium number of neighbors is much lower when the birds are learning about the presence of resources rather than predators. Second, when the information is about the presence of predators, we find that the equilibrium number of neighbors increases as the information becomes more widespread. Third, we find that an optimization process converges on strategies that allow the flock to reach consensus when the information is about the presence of abundant resources, but not when it is about the presence of scarce resources or predators.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSturnus vulgaris 3abirds 3aflight 3aflocks 3alearning 3amodels 3apredators1 aLeonard, Naomi Ehrich1 aLevin, Simon A.0 tTheoretical ecology.g2016 Dec., v. 9, no. 4 p.455-476dSpringer Netherlandsx1874-17387nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12080-016-0301-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02991naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001900139245015900158300001600317500001900333500002000352520141900372592002801791596002401819596004701843596006301890596005901953596006302012596001902075650001302094650003102107650001302138650002602151650001302177650000902190650001502199651001002214700001802224700001802242700002002260700001702280700002202297773012002319856007302439852000902512655001202521IND60734490820221121230504.0210420e201307  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073449082DNAL7 a10.1111/nph.122842doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Xue‐Yan10aAmmonium first: natural mosses prefer atmospheric ammonium but vary utilization of dissolved organic nitrogen depending on habitat and nitrogen deposition  ap. 407-419.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aMosses, among all types of terrestrial vegetation, are excellent scavengers of anthropogenic nitrogen (N), but their utilization of dissolved organic N (DON) and their reliance on atmospheric N remain uncharacterized in natural environments, which obscures their roles in N cycles. Natural ¹⁵N abundance of N sources (nitrate (NO3−), ammonium (NH4+) and DON in deposition and soil) for epilithic and terricolous mosses was analyzed at sites with different N depositions at Guiyang, China. Moss NO3− assimilation was inhibited substantially by the high supply of NH4+ and DON. Therefore, contributions of NH4+ and DON to moss N were partitioned using isotopic mass‐balance methods. The N contributions averaged 56% and 46% from atmospheric NH4+, and 44% and 17% from atmospheric DON in epilithic and terricolous mosses, respectively. In terricolous mosses, soil NH4+ and soil DON accounted for 16% and 21% of bulk N, which are higher than current estimations obtained using ¹⁵N‐labeling methods. Moreover, anthropogenic NH4+ deposition suppressed utilization of DON and soil N because of the preference of moss for NH4+ under elevated NH4+ deposition. These results underscore the dominance of, and preference for, atmospheric NH4+ in moss N utilization, and highlight the importance of considering DON and soil N sources when estimating moss N sequestration and the impacts of N deposition on mosses.  aPublisher supplied data  cSumitomo Foundation  aNo. 21310008cCreative Scientific Research  aNos 40903012cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a41021062cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  aand 41273026cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a09F09316cJSPS 3aammonium 3adissolved organic nitrogen 3ahabitats 3amosses and liverworts 3anitrates 3asoil 3avegetation 3aChina1 aKoba, Keisuke1 aMakabe, Akiko1 aLi, Xiao‐Dong1 aYoh, Muneoki1 aLiu, Cong‐Qiang0 tThe new phytologist.g2013 July, v. 199, no. 2 p.407-419dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl44665x0028-646X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/nph.122843Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04239naa a2200709 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002700111040001800138100002300156245012300179300002000302520194800322592002802270650003502298650002102333650003102354650000902385650001702394650002402411650003802435650002402473650000902497650001802506650001202524650002702536650002202563650002202585650001102607650001202618650003802630650004302668650004002711650006602751650007002817650004802887650001502935650005002950653001003000653001103010653001503021653000903036653002603045700001403071700002103085700002303106700001603129700002003145700001703165700001503182700001703197700001903214700002203233700002103255700002203276773013503298852000903433856007503442655001203517IND4477475820221121234313.0160905e20131226xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447747582DNAL7 a243281252pmid7 a10.1021/jf40314582doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aArmstrong, Toni A.10aQuantification of Transgene-Derived Double-Stranded RNA in Plants Using the QuantiGene Nucleic Acid Detection Platform  ap. 12557-12564.  aThe expanding use of RNA interference (RNAi) in agricultural biotechnology necessitates tools for characterizing and quantifying double-stranded RNA (dsRNA)-containing transcripts that are expressed in transgenic plants. We sought to detect and quantify such transcripts in transgenic maize lines engineered to control western corn rootworm (Diabrotica virgifera virgifera LeConte) via overexpression of an inverted repeat sequence bearing a portion of the putative corn rootworm orthologue of yeast Snf7 (DvSnf7), an essential component of insect cell receptor sorting. A quantitative assay was developed to detect DvSnf7 sense strand-containing dsRNA transcripts that is based on the QuantiGene Plex 2.0 RNA assay platform from Affymetrix. The QuantiGene assay utilizes cooperative binding of multiple oligonucleotide probes with specificity for the target sequence resulting in exceptionally high assay specificity. Successful implementation of this assay required heat denaturation in the presence of the oligonucleotide probes prior to hybridization, presumably to dissociate primary transcripts carrying the duplex dsRNA structure. The dsRNA assay was validated using a strategy analogous to the rigorous enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay evaluations that are typically performed for foreign proteins expressed in transgenic plants. Validation studies indicated that the assay is sensitive (to 10 pg of dsRNA/g of fresh tissue), highly reproducible, and linear over ∼2.5 logs. The assay was validated using purified RNA from multiple maize tissue types, and studies indicate that the assay is also quantitative in crude tissue lysates. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of a non-polymerase chain reaction-based quantitative assay for dsRNA-containing transcripts, based on the use of the QuantiGene technology platform, and will broadly facilitate characterization of dsRNA in biological and environmental samples.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDiabrotica virgifera virgifera 3aRNA interference 3aagricultural biotechnology 3acorn 3adenaturation 3adouble-stranded RNA 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3agene overexpression 3aheat 3ahybridization 3ainsects 3aoligonucleotide probes 3aprotein synthesis 3atransgenic plants 3ayeasts 2aAnimals 2aColeopteraxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aInsect Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aNucleic Acid Hybridizationxmethods 2aPlant Diseasesxgeneticsxparasitologyxprevention & control. 2aPlants, Genetically Modifiedxgeneticsxmetabolismxparasitology. 2aRNA, Double-Strandedxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aTransgenes 2aZea maysxgeneticsxmetabolismxparasitology. 0adsRNA 0aDvSnf7 0aQuantiGene 0aRNAi 0awestern corn rootworm1 aChen, Hao1 aZiegler, Todd E.1 aIyadurai, Kelly

Fluorescent-labeled probe designed to contain variable degree of homology with a ‘target sequence’ of several known reference PVY strains was annealed to PCR products of these viruses followed by a graded melting analysis. The specific characteristics of the melting curves enable the detection, distinction and differentiation of each of following four known PVY strains O-FL, O-RB, N and NTN, in a single reaction obviating the need for size or nucleotide sequence analyses. In addition, it was demonstrated that virus extracts from plants infected with more than one strain can be resolved using this procedure. The melting-curves of extracts from 55 market size tubers harvested randomly from commercial fields and compared with those of the reference virus strains, revealed the presence of O-FL, O-RB and NTN strains of PVY.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPotato virus Y 3afluorescent labeling 3amarkets 3amelting 3anucleotide sequences 3aoligonucleotides 3apolymerase chain reaction 3apotatoes 3asequence analysis 3atubers 3aviruses1 aShtein, C.1 aRosner, A.1 aLevy, D.1 aRabinowitch, H.

The present study was carried out to provide a scientific basis of the identification and the authenticity of P. microphylla with the help of pharmacognostical parameters, which is not done before. Roots, stems, and leaves of P. microphylla were collected for pharmacognostical studies involving macros, microscopic evaluation, physicochemical parameters analysis like fluorescence analysis and thin layer chromatography, in addition with DNA barcodes of internal transcribed spacer and psbA-trnH regions. Transverse section of root indicated the presence of stone cell bands. Transverse section of stem showed the presence of stone cells and vessels. Transverse section of leaf midrib revealed the presence of shaft type of porosity. Microscopic studies of powder revealed the presence of cork cells, fibers, vessels, nonglandular hairs, stone cells and glandular scale cells. Thin layer chromatography of the extract revealed the presence of oleanolic acid in P. microphylla with specific Rf values. Identification through DNA barcode showed the sequence of internal transcribed spacer region was novel while the sequence of psbA-trnH region displayed no differences from known sequence. The observations confirmed that P. microphylla has an obvious pharmacognostical characteristics, which will be useful toward providing a reliable basis for identification, purity, quality and classification of the plant.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA barcoding 3aPremna microphylla 3acork 3afluorescence 3ainternal transcribed spacers 3aleaves 3amedicine 3aoleanolic acid 3aphysicochemical properties 3aporosity 3aroots 3astems 3athin layer chromatography 3atrichomes 0aDNA barcode 0aIdentification 0aMacroscopic 0aMicroscopic 0aPharmacognostical 0aPhysicochemical1 aLin, Xiaojing1 aLi, Junni1 aLi, Rong1 aWang, Dong1 aJi, Shengguo0 tRevista Brasileira de Farmacognosia.g2018 Sept.,  Oct., v. 28, no. 5 p.520-526dElsevier Editora Ltda.aSociedade Brasileira de FarmacognosiawJournal:23273x0102-695X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bjp.2018.07.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02515naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002100153245017400174300001800348520105900366592002801425650002301453650002901476650002501505650001901530650002201549650002301571650001101594650002001605650002001625653003301645653002501678653003101703653003401734653001801768653002701786700002401813700002001837700001901857773010801876856008801984852000902072655001202081IND60613065020221117042743.0190628e201810  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061306502DNAL7 a10.1016/j.marpolbul.2018.08.0552doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKaikkonen, Laura10aAssessing the impacts of seabed mineral extraction in the deep sea and coastal marine environments: Current methods and recommendations for environmental risk assessment  ap. 1183-1197.  aMineral extraction from the seabed has experienced a recent surge of interest from both the mining industry and marine scientists. While improved methods of geological investigation have enabled the mapping of new seafloor mineral reserves, the ecological impacts of mining in both the deep sea and the shallow seabed are poorly known. This paper presents a synthesis of the empirical evidence from experimental seabed mining and parallel industries to infer the effects of seabed mineral extraction on marine ecosystems, focusing on polymetallic nodules and ferromanganese concretions. We use a problem-structuring framework to evaluate causal relationships between pressures caused by nodule extraction and the associated changes in marine ecosystems. To ensure that the rationale behind impact assessments is clear, we propose that future impact assessments use pressure-specific expert elicitation. We further discuss integrating ecosystem services in the impact assessments and the implications of current methods for environmental risk assessments.  aPublisher supplied data 3aecosystem services 3aenvironmental assessment 3aenvironmental impact 3aexpert opinion 3amarine ecosystems 3amarine environment 3amining 3arisk assessment 3awater pollution 0aEcological impact assessment 0aPolymetallic nodules 0aMarine resource governance 0aEnvironmental risk assessment 0aSeabed mining 0aDAPSI(W)R(M) framework1 aVenesjärvi, Riikka1 aNygård, Henrik1 aKuikka, Sakari0 tMarine pollution bulletin.g2018 Oct., v. 135 p.1183-1197dElsevier LtdwJournal:12420x0025-326X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.marpolbul.2018.08.0553Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02006naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245013100168300001800299520102900317592002801346650001401374650001401388650002201402650001101424650001801435651001201453700002001465773012901485856008101614852000901695655001201704IND60750438520221120101654.0210915e202109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075043852DNAL7 a10.1134/S10227954210800202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBocharova, A.

There is a decrease in genetic diversity in the geographic space from west to east. The highest level of genetic diversity was shown in Caucasoid populations. There are two groups of SNPs that predominate in Caucasians or Mongoloids. The location of sixteen populations in the space of the principle components demonstrates their geographic localization. Clusterization of populations in accordance with their affiliation to four geographic regions was observed. In general, the analysis of within- and between-population genetic diversity for 28 markers in 16 populations replicates the patterns of the Northern Eurasia gene pool structure, which are described using other marker systems.  aPublisher supplied data 3acognition 3agene pool 3agenetic variation 3ahumans 3aschizophrenia 3aEurasia1 aStepanov, V.

And will the derived food waste (FW) impose AR risk to the environment after biological treatment? This study used restaurant FW leachates flowing through a 200 tons-waste/day biological treatment plant as a window to investigate the fate of antibiotics and antibiotic-resistance genes (ARGs) during the acceptance and treatment of FW. Sulfonamides (sulfamethazine, sulfamethoxazole) and quinolones (ciprofloxacin, enrofloxacin, ofloxacin) were detected during FW treatment, while tetracyclines, macrolides and chloramphenicols were not observable. ARGs encoding resistance to sulfonamides, tetracyclines and macrolides emerged in FW leachates. Material flow analysis illustrated that the total amount of antibiotics (except sulfamethazine) and ARGs were constant during FW treatment processes. Both the concentration and total amount of most antibiotics and ARGs fluctuated during treatment, physical processes (screening, centrifugation, solid–liquid and oil–water separation) did not decrease antibiotic or ARGs concentrations or total levels permanently; the affiliated wastewater treatment plant appeared to remove sulfonamides and most ARGs concentrations and total amount. Heavy metals Ni, Co and Cu were important for disseminating antibiotics concentrations and MGEs for distributing ARGs concentrations. Humic substances (fulvic acids, hydrophilic fractions), C-associated and N-associated contents were essential for the distribution of the total amounts of antibiotics and ARGs. Overall, this study implied that human food might not be free of antibiotics and ARGs, and FW was an underestimated AR pool with various determinants. Nonetheless, derived hazards of FW could be mitigated through biological treatment with well-planned daily operations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantibiotic resistance 3abiological treatment 3acentrifugation 3aciprofloxacin 3acobalt 3acopper 3aenrofloxacin 3afood waste 3afulvic acids 3agenes 3aheavy metals 3ahydrophilicity 3ainterspersed repetitive sequences 3aleachates 3amacrolides 3amaterial flow analysis 3anickel 3arestaurants 3arisk 3ascreening 3asulfamethazine 3asulfamethoxazole 3atetracyclines 3awastewater treatment 0aFood waste 0aBiological treatment 0aAnaerobic digestion 0aAntibiotics 0aAntibiotic resistance genes 0aMaterial flow analysis1 aYu, Zhuofeng1 aShao, Liming1 aZhou, Yizhou1 aLu, Fan,0 tJournal of environmental sciences (China).g2019 Nov., v. 85 p.17-34dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12417x1001-07427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jes.2019.04.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02851naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002500150245017500175300001600350520108400366592002801450650002301478650001601501650001401517650001201531650001101543650001601554650000901570650002201579650001501601650002101616650002001637650000901657650001701666650004101683650000901724650001501733650001401748650000901762653003301771653003001804653002901834653003201863653002701895653002001922700002701942700002601969700001801995700002502013700002702038773012702065856008402192852000902276655001202285IND60122096020150511000000.0150324e20140603xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012209602DNAL7 a10.1080/03650340.2013.8437732doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMishra, Pankaj Kumar10aSynergistic effect of inoculating plant growth-promoting Pseudomonas spp. and Rhizobium leguminosarum-FB1 on growth and nutrient uptake of rajmash (Phaseolus vulgaris L.)  ap. 799-815.  aPlant growth-promoting bacteria (PGPB) Pseudomonas lurida -NPRp15 and Pseudomonas putida- PGRs4 possessing multiple plant growth-promoting traits were isolated from rhizoplane of pea and rhizosphere of garlic, respectively.

The results of the study indicate the potential of harnessing the benefit of plant growth-promoting and nitrogen-fixing microorganisms to improve the growth and yield of rajmash.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPhaseolus vulgaris 3aPseudomonas 3aRhizobium 3abiomass 3agarlic 3agreenhouses 3airon 3anitrogen fixation 3anodulation 3anutrient content 3anutrient uptake 3apeas 3aplant growth 3aplant growth-promoting rhizobacteria 3apods 3arhizoplane 3asynergism 3azinc 0arajmash (Phaseolus vulgaris) 0aPseudomonas lurida-NPRp15 0aPseudomonas putida-PGRs4 0aRhizobium leguminosarum-FB1 0aplant growth promotion 0anutrient uptake1 aBisht, Shekhar Chandra1 aJeevanandan, Krishnan1 aKumar, Sanjay1 aBisht, Jaideep Kumar1 aBhatt, Jagdish Chandra0 tArchiv für Acker- und Pflanzenbau und Bodenkunde.g2014 June 3, v. 60, no. 6 p.799-815dTaylor & Francisx1476-35677nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/03650340.2013.8437733Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04226naa a2200649 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094024002200125024001900147040001800166100002600184245016700210300001600377506007600393520219500469592002802664506003702692650001002729650002202739650002702761650001702788650001002805650001202815650001602827650002602843650001902869650001202888650003002900650002402930650001602954650002302970650002002993650001303013650001603026650001903042650001503061651001003076653002703086653002003113653001203133653001003145700001803155700002003173700002103193700001803214700002003232700002203252700001703274700002203291700002403313773014003337856007803477852000903555655001203564IND60657984320221207114142.0191004e20190901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065798432DNAL7 a10.1089/vbz.2018.24092doi7 aPMC67161932pmcid7 a309644132pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSalako, Albert Sourou10aPopulation Dynamics of Anopheles gambiae s.l. and Culex quinquefasciatus in Rural and Urban Settings Before an Indoor Residual Spraying Campaign in Northern Benin  ap. 674-684.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBackground: The purpose of this report is to provide information on Culicidae diversity; biting behavior and spatio-seasonal variation of abundance of Anopheles gambiae s.l. and Culex quinquefasciatus in rural and urban settings of the Alibori and Donga regions, Northern Benin, where an indoor residual spraying (IRS) campaign to control malaria is planned. Methods: Both human landing catches, associated with pyrethrum spray catches were used to monitor the mosquito populations in 12 sites with 1 urban and 1 rural located in each of the 6 districts randomly selected in the two targeted regions. After morphological identification of all mosquito specimens, biting behavior and density of An. gambiae s.l. and Cx quinquefasciatus were studied. PCR was also performed on An. gambiae s.l., to identify sibling species and its seasonal variation. Results: A total of 10,367 mosquitoes were captured, related to 14 species of the genera, Anopheles, Aedes, Culex and Mansonia. Of the total species collection, 40.39% were An. gambiae s.l. and 56.85% were Cx. quinquefasciatus. An. gambiae s.l. was more abundant in Donga (2521 specimens) compared with Alibori (1666 specimens). The opposite trend was observed with Cx. quinquefasciatus (2162 specimens in Donga against 4028 in Alibori). An. gambiae s.l. was predominant and displayed a higher blood feeding rate in rural areas, whereas Cx. quinquefasciatus was in majority in urban areas. An. gambiae s.l. was more endophagic, whereas Cx. quinquefasciatus showed similar indoor and outdoor biting behavior. An. gambiae s.l. was composed of An. coluzzii found in majority in the drought, and An. gambiae, which was predominant in the rainy season. Conclusion: The predominance of the malaria vector, An. gambiae s.l. and their higher blood feeding rate and their significantly high endophagy in rural areas indicate that these areas should be primarily targeted with the IRS operations to have a substantial impact on malaria transmission. Endophagy, characteristic of An. gambiae s.l. in our study area, suggests that IRS will have a positive impact on vector control if implemented 1 week before June that is the onset of the rainy season.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aAedes 3aAnopheles gambiae 3aCulex quinquefasciatus 3abiodiversity 3ablood 3adrought 3ahematophagy 3ahuman-landing catches 3ainsect vectors 3amalaria 3apolymerase chain reaction 3apopulation dynamics 3arural areas 3aseasonal variation 3asibling species 3aspraying 3aurban areas 3avector control 3awet season 3aBenin 0aAnopheles gambiae s.l. 0abiting behavior 0aAlibori 0aDonga1 aOssè, Razaki1 aPadonou, Gil G.1 aDagnon, Fortuné1 aAïkpon, Rock1 aKpanou, Casimir1 aSagbohan, Hermann1 aSovi, Arthur1 aSèzonlin, Michel1 aAkogbeto, Martin C.0 tVector borne and zoonotic diseases.g2019 Sept. 01, v. 19, no. 9 p.674-684dMary Ann Liebert, Inc.wJournal:J000000160x1557-77597nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1089/vbz.2018.24093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02934naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002700147245014900174300001600323520145800339592002801797650001501825650001901840650002201859650003001881650002001911650003801931650001501969650001201984650001301996650002302009650001102032650002402043650001602067650001302083650005202096650001302148650001602161650001102177650001102188651001802199700001802217700002102235773010602256856008102362852000902443655001202452IND60573246320221120111300.0170721e201612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057324632DNAL7 a10.1007/s12230-016-9534-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMacKenzie, Tyler D. B.10aCrop Management Practices and Reduction of On-Farm Spread of Potato virus Y: a 5-Year Study in Commercial Potato Fields in New Brunswick, Canada  ap. 552-563.  aIn this study, on-farm within-season spread of Potato virus Y (PVY) was measured in 56 seed, processing and tablestock potato fields in New Brunswick, Canada between 2010 and 2014. These represented 13 potato varieties, managed by 16 growers employing a wide range of PVY control techniques. Many aspects of management techniques were quantified, as well local aphid abundances and climatological data. PVY spread, measured in leaves and tubers (by ELISA and RT-PCR), was tracked through the season in individually marked plants. Over the five seasons under study, on-farm PVY spread overall has declined substantially. Across all 56 fields, however, it has varied widely, from 10 fields not showing any spread during the crop season, up to as high as 76 % spread in one 2012 field. Factors correlated with increased PVY spread included seed-borne PVY inoculum planted in the field, aphid abundance early in the season, and to a lesser degree temperatures in July and over the preceding winter. Factors correlated with decreased spread included numbers of foliar mineral oil and insecticide sprays (especially of the lambda-cyhalothrin and flonicamid types), later crop planting and earlier first spraying dates. A mid-season leaf test for PVY was shown to be strongly indicative of ultimate PVY spread at harvest, and may prove a useful test in advising growers. A set of locally-relevant best management practices based on these results is discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAphidoidea 3aPotato virus Y 3aSolanum tuberosum 3abest management practices 3acrop management 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3aflonicamid 3agrowers 3ainoculum 3alambda-cyhalothrin 3aleaves 3ameteorological data 3amineral oil 3apotatoes 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3aspraying 3atemperature 3atubers 3awinter 3aNew Brunswick1 aNie, Xianzhou1 aSingh, Mathuresh0 tAmerican journal of potato research.g2016 Dec., v. 93, no. 6 p.552-563dSpringer USx1099-209X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12230-016-9534-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02850naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002400147245013000171300001600301500001500317520110600332592002801438650001501466650002001481650001001501650001301511650001401524650002101538650001101559650002001570650001501590650002001605650002401625650001401649650001001663650001201673650002301685653001501708653002001723653001101743653002001754653001901774653001201793653002301805700005801828700005801886700001801944700002001962700002301982700001802005700002002023773013902043856008102182852000902263655001202272IND60632951920221118221227.0190318e201811  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063295192DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bjp.2018.07.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRaman, Vijayasankar10aMicroscopic characterization and HPTLC of the leaves, stems and roots of Fadogia agrestis – an African folk medicinal plant  ap. 631-639.  a2019-12-06  aFadogia agrestis Schweinf. ex Hiern (Vangueria agrestis (Schweinf. ex Hiern) Lantz), Rubiaceae, is an African traditional medicinal plant also used as a dietary supplement in the US.

Level of fire blight resistance was evaluated according to the extent of lesion development on the shoots tips after artificial inoculation in experimental plots under insectproof nets. Cultivars Quinte (resistant) and Yellow transparent (high susceptible) were included in the tests. Of 64 apple cultivars and selections tested, none were high resistant, 3.1% were evaluated as resistant, 10.9% moderately resistant, 57.8% moderately susceptible, 21.9% susceptible and 6.3% high susceptible. Resistant apple genotypes, showing blight necrosis of shoots of 11–12%, were only cultivars Selena and Quinte. Moderately resistant genotypes (blight necrosis 13.1–25.0%) were Kordona, Golden Smoothee, Julia, HL 323, Melodie, HL 421 and S 634/3. High susceptible genotypes (blight necrosis more then 80.1%) were comprised cultivars Vesna, Topas, Yellow transparent and Vanda. The remaining genotypes were moderately susceptible (blight necrosis 26.1–60.0%) and susceptible (blight necrosis 60.1–80.0%). During six experimental years, quantitative variability was recorded in the blight score. Differences between cultivars in susceptibility to fire blight were often statistically significant.  aPublisher supplied data 3aErwinia amylovora 3aVanda 3aapples 3ablight 3acultivars 3afire blight 3anecrosis 3apathogens 3aplant protection 3aCzech Republic1 aŠillerová, J.1 aKůdela, V.0 tPlant Protection Science.g, v. 44, no. 3 p.91-96dCzech Academy of Agricultural ScienceswJournal:21418x1212-25807nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.17221/19/2008-pps3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03152naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245009900169300001600268520189400284592002802178650002202206650001702228650001102245650001902256650001502275650002102290650002602311650001502337650001902352650001002371650001302381650002102394650001302415650001102428651001402439700002502453700002202478700002202500773010602522856008102628852000902709655001202718IND60573246520221120111345.0170721e201612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057324652DNAL7 a10.1007/s12230-016-9532-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKelling, Keith A.10aInteractive Effects of Fumigation and Fungicides on Potato Response to Nitrogen Rate or Timing  ap. 533-542.  aThe availability and use of crop protectants including azoxystrobin in combination with fumigation has extended the Central Wisconsin effective growing season by 2 to 4 weeks. This study, evaluating the influence of these crop protection practices on the optimum nitrogen rate and time of application for Russet Burbank potato (Solanum tuberosum L.), was established as two 3-year field trials designed as split-split plot experiments. Both experiments used metam sodium as the main plots and fungicide treatment (chlorothalonil Zn alone or chlorothalonil Zn alternated with azoxystrobin for the first six sprays) as the first split. In-season fertilizer N rate (179, 224, 269, or 313 kg N ha⁻¹) or in-season N timing (N split into two, three, or four applications at 269 kg N ha⁻¹) was the second split. Not fumigating resulted in significantly higher verticillium ratings and severely repressed crop yield and tuber quality responses to both fungicide treatment and N rate. On average, fumigation increased total yield 13.6 Mg ha⁻¹yr⁻¹, U.S. No. 1 tubers by 9 % and U.S. No. 1 tubers >170 g by 5 % over where fumigation was not used. In 2 of the 3 years when azoxystrobin was included in the fungicide program early blight severity was reduced by about 50 %, and on fumigated areas yields were increased 4.8 Mg ha⁻¹, whereas no yield increase was seen from this fungicide treatment on the non-fumigated plots. In these same years, fumigation increased optimum N rate by about 50 kg ha⁻¹; however, there was no apparent interaction with fungicide treatment. Although fumigation, fungicide treatment, and time of N application each influenced tuber yield or tuber quality in some years, in the two more responsive years some interactions between these factors were statistically significant, with benefits generally only seen where plots were fumigated.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSolanum tuberosum 3aazoxystrobin 3ablight 3achlorothalonil 3acrop yield 3afertilizer rates 3afield experimentation 3afumigation 3agrowing season 3ametam 3anitrogen 3aplant protection 3apotatoes 3atubers 3aWisconsin1 aStevenson, Walter R.1 aSpeth, Phillip E.1 aJames, R.

The aim of this study is to develop a method for efficiently detecting inflammation modulatory activities. Here we established RAW264.7 macrophage cells stably expressing a luciferase reporter gene directed by iNOS or COX-2 promoter. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) treatment stimulated the luciferase activity which paralleled with increased iNOS and COX-2 mRNA levels determined by RT-q-PCR. The LPS-stimulated luciferase activity was blocked by NF-κB inhibitor CAPE and by nobiletin, an anti-inflammatory natural product from citrus peels. We have applied the platforms to screen various mushroom species; analysis by scatter plot revealed a strong correlation to the results obtained by ELISA-based detection of TNF-α. Together we have established luciferase reporter systems sensitive to NF-κB-dependent iNOS and COX-2 activation, which provides an alternative screening method for identifying food components with immune-modulatory activities.  aPublisher supplied data 3acitrus peels 3ainflammation 3alipopolysaccharides 3aluciferase 3amacrophages 3amessenger RNA 3amushrooms 3anitric oxide synthase 3aprostaglandin synthase 3areporter genes 3ascreening 3atranscription (genetics) 3atranscription factor NF-kappa B 3atumor necrosis factor-alpha 2aAnimals 2aAnti-Inflammatory Agentsxanalysisximmunology. 2aBiological Assayxinstrumentationxmethods. 2aCitrusxchemistry 2aCyclooxygenase 2xgeneticsximmunology. 2aGenes, Reporter 2aMacrophagesxdrug effectsxenzymologyximmunology. 2aMice 2aNF-kappa Bxanalysisximmunology. 2aNitric Oxide Synthase Type IIxgeneticsximmunology. 2aPlant Extractsxpharmacology 0aiNOS 0aCOX-2 0aluciferase assay 0aRAW264.7 0acell platform1 aLin, Ju-Hwa1 aLu, Ting-Jang1 aChiang, An-Na1 aChiou, Shih-Ting1 aChen, Yi-An1 aPan, Min-Hsiung1 aHsieh, Shu-Chen0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2013 Dec. 26, v. 61, no. 51 p.12582-12587dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-51187nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fjf404887u3Available from publisher's site 7aarticle03334naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002500151245009700176300001600273520179600289592002802085650002102113650002502134650001202159650001302171650001302184650002002197650000902217650002002226650001702246650001602263650001502279650001202294650001402306650001202320650001802332650001202350650003802362650001102400650001302411650001902424650001302443650001802456650001002474650001402484700002002498700002102518700002402539773013502563856008502698852000902783655001202792IND60331833720221119045107.0150727e20150703xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6033183372DNAL7 a10.1080/15222055.2015.10095902doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDiMaggio, Matthew A.10aSpawning, Larviculture, and Salinity Tolerance of Alewives and Blueback Herring in Captivity  ap. 302-311.  aPrecipitous declines in wild populations of river herring species (Alewives Alosa pseudoharengus and Blueback Herring A. aestivalis) have led to increased interest in stock enhancement efforts. Additionally, their popularity as a baitfish among recreational anglers has generated interest in commercial production of these species for marine baitfish markets. The objective of this investigation was to elucidate practical culture protocols for captive propagation of these species for commercial and restoration purposes. Wild Blueback Herring, captured during their annual spawning migration, spawned in tanks volitionally, while Alewives required exogenous hormone administration. Larvae of both species were successfully raised through metamorphosis using a feeding regime comprised of enriched rotifers followed by Artemia nauplii and a commercially available diet. Survival of early larvae acclimated to salinities ranging from 5‰ to 15‰ was high for both species (>94.0%) while that for older larvae acclimated to 15, 20, and 30‰ ranged from 64.7% to 95.3%. Juveniles raised at varying salinities (0–30‰) exhibited high survival (95.6–100.0%) and excellent feed conversion ratios (≤1.31) in all treatments. In acute salinity transfer experiments, high survival was observed when fish of both species (233–275 d posthatch) were transferred from low to high salinities, but low survival (10.0% and 3.3%) was observed in Alewives transferred from 15‰ or 30‰ to freshwater (0‰). A nodular fibrotic growth was found on 3.7% and 10.1% of the cultured Alewives and Blueback Herring (≥231 d posthatch), respectively, that likely followed tissue trauma and ulceration. The results of these studies provide a framework for river herring culture in recirculating systems.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAlosa aestivalis 3aAlosa pseudoharengus 3aArtemia 3aRotifera 3abaitfish 3acaptive animals 3adiet 3afeed conversion 3afish culture 3afish larvae 3afreshwater 3aherring 3ajuveniles 3amarkets 3ametamorphosis 3anauplii 3arecirculating aquaculture systems 3arivers 3asalinity 3asalt tolerance 3aspawning 3asurvival rate 3atanks 3awild fish1 aPine, Harvey J.1 aKenter, Linas W.1 aBerlinsky, David L.0 tNorth American journal of aquaculture.g2015 July 3, v. 77, no. 3 p.302-311dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl4207184x1522-20557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15222055.2015.10095903Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02756naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100006400153245011300217300001600330520129000346592002801636650001701664650001001681650002401691650002201715650002001737650001101757650001301768653002601781653003601807653002401843653003501867653001401902653002301916700002401939700001901963700002401982700001802006700002102024700002202045700002202067773011202089856008802201852000902289655001202298IND60582082320221121234811.0181015e201709  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058208232DNAL7 a10.1016/j.forsciint.2017.07.0152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aReynolds, Mikaela S.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7939-392410aStandardized anthropological measurement of postcranial bones using three-dimensional models in CAD software  ap. 381-387.  aThis study introduces a standardized protocol for conducting linear measurements of postcranial skeletal elements using three-dimensional (3D) models constructed from post-mortem computed tomography (PMCT) scans. Using femoral DICOM datasets, reference planes were generated and plane-to-plane measurements were conducted on 3D surface rendered models. Bicondylar length, epicondylar breadth, anterior-posterior (AP) diameter, medial-lateral (ML) diameter and cortical area at the midshaft were measured by four observers to test the measurement error variance and observer agreement of the protocol (n=6). Intra-observer error resulted in a mean relative technical error of measurement (%TEM) of 0.11 and an intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) of 0.999 (CI=0.998–1.000); inter-observer error resulted in a mean %TEM of 0.54 and ICC of 0.996 (CI=0.979–1.000) for bicondylar length. Epicondylar breadth, AP diameter, ML diameter and cortical area also yielded minimal error. Precision testing demonstrated that the approach is highly repeatable and is recommended for implementation in anthropological investigation and research. This study exploits the benefits of virtual anthropology, introducing an innovative, standardized alternative to dry bone osteometric measurements.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanthropology 3abones 3acomputed tomography 3acomputer software 3adata collection 3amodels 3avariance 0aForensic anthropology 0aMulti-slice computed tomography 0aReverse engineering 0aTechnical error of measurement 0aPrecision 0aObserver-agreement1 aMacGregor, Donna M.1 aBarry, Mark D.1 aLottering, Nicolene1 aSchmutz, Beat1 aWilson, Lance J.1 aMeredith, Matthew1 aGregory, Laura S.0 tForensic science international.g2017 Sept., v. 278 p.381-387dElsevier B.V.wJournal:3523x0379-07387nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.forsciint.2017.07.0153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02465naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002400150245009700174300001400271520114900285592002801434650001001462650001301472650001001485650001301495650001201508650000901520650001001529650001001539650002901549650001201578650001201590650001201602650001901614650002601633650001401659650001101673650001501684650001701699650001501716650001701731651001001748700002601758773010601784856008401890852000901974655001201983IND60600723520221121172932.0180703e20141205xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060072352DNAL7 a10.1016/j.quaint.2013.07.0532doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBranch, Nicholas P.10aMid-Late Holocene environmental change and human activities in the northern Apennines, Italy  ap. 34-51.  aRadiocarbon-dated palaeoecological records from the upland zone of the northern Apennines spanning the Mid-Late Holocene (last 7000 years) have been evaluated using established criteria for detecting anthropogenic impact on the landscape and environment. The integrated palaeoecological records across the study area collectively indicate human interference with natural vegetation succession and landscape modification from at least the Middle Neolithic. These activities resulted in the progressive decline of Abies, Ulmus, Fraxinus and Tilia, and the spread of Fagus, from ∼7000 cal BP, accompanied at various times by evidence for biomass burning, soil erosion, the expansion of shrubland and herbaceous taxa, and the possible cultivation of Olea, Juglans and Castanea. Comparison of these data with the archaeological scheme for the region, and the climate history of the central-western Mediterranean, has revealed that the palaeoecological records broadly support the archaeological evidence, but suggest that several key vegetation changes also coincide with important periods of climate change, especially at ∼7800–5000 cal BP.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAbies 3aCastanea 3aFagus 3aFraxinus 3aJuglans 3aOlea 3aTilia 3aUlmus 3aanthropogenic activities 3abiomass 3aburning 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3aecological succession 3ahighlands 3ahumans 3alandscapes 3apaleoecology 3ashrublands 3asoil erosion 3aItaly1 aMarini, Nathalie A.F.0 tQuaternary international.g2014 Dec. 05, v. 353 p.34-51dElsevier LtdwJournal:12411x1040-61827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.quaint.2013.07.0533Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03927naa a2200721 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002700111040001800138100002100156245013700177300002000314520172000334592002802054650003002082650001402112650001402126650001402140650001402154650001402168650001502182650002302197650001402220650001602234650001102250650002402261650000902285650003702294650002502331650002002356650001902376650001202395650001202407650002902419650002102448650003702469650003902506650006802545650001102613650000902624650001502633650002602648650005702674650003302731650003602764653001802800653001202818653001602830653001202846653001402858700001502872700001502887700001902902700001702921700001702938700001902955773013502974852000903109856007503118655001203193IND4477476720221121222217.0160905e20131226xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447747672DNAL7 a243084852pmid7 a10.1021/jf40346882doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShin, Soon Young10aNovel Antimitotic Activity of 2-Hydroxy-4-methoxy-2′,3′-benzochalcone (HymnPro) through the Inhibition of Tubulin Polymerization  ap. 12588-12597.  aThe natural chalcones and their derivatives exhibit many biological activities, such as anti-inflammatory and antitumoral. However, the precise mechanisms of action of benzochalcone derivatives are currently unknown. Here, a set of benzochalcones was synthesized, and the molecular mechanisms underlying inhibition of tumor growth were investigated. Colony-forming assays revealed that among tested compounds, 2-hydroxy-4-methoxy-2′,3′-benzochalcone (HymnPro) most effectively inhibited the clonogenicity of Capan-1 human pancreatic cancer cells. HymnPro inhibited cell proliferation in several human solid tumor cell lines and suppressed xenografted tumor growth in nude mice. Mechanistically, HymnPro induced cell cycle arrest at the G₂/M phase, followed by an increase in apoptotic cell death. These events were associated with the inhibition of tubulin polymerization through binding of HymnPro to tubulin, leading to the formation of abnormal mono- or multipolar mitotic microtubule structures accompanied by spherical arrangement of multinucleated chromosomes. Furthermore, HymnPro activated caspase-2, caspase-9, caspase-3, and caspase-7 and increased the cleavage of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP). HymnPro increased the phosphorylation of JNK1/2, Erk1/2, and p38 kinase. Pretreatment with SP600125, U0126, or SB600125 abrogated HymnPro-induced activation of caspases-3 and caspase-7 and the cleavage of PARP, suggesting that MAPK signalings are involved in HymnPro-induced apoptosis. It was concluded that a novel HymnPro compound exerts antitumor activity by disrupting microtubule assembly, which leads to mitotic arrest and sequential activation of the caspase pathway, resulting in apoptosis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanticarcinogenic activity 3aapoptosis 3acaspase-2 3acaspase-3 3acaspase-7 3acaspase-9 3acell cycle 3acell proliferation 3achalcones 3achromosomes 3ahumans 3amechanism of action 3amice 3amitogen-activated protein kinase 3apancreatic neoplasms 3aphosphorylation 3apolymerization 3atubulin 2aAnimals 2aCell Cyclexdrug effects 2aCell Line, Tumor 2aCell Proliferationxdrug effects 2aChalconexchemistryxpharmacology. 2aGrowth Inhibitorsxchemical synthesisxchemistryxpharmacology. 2aHumans 2aMice 2aMice, Nude 2aMitosisxdrug effects 2aPancreatic Neoplasmsxdrug therapyxphysiopathology. 2aPolymerizationxdrug effects 2aTubulinxchemistryxmetabolism. 0abenzochalcone 0atubulin 0aG2/M arrest 0acaspase 0aapoptosis1 aKim, Ji-Ho1 aYoon, Hyuk1 aChoi, Yang-Kyu1 aKoh, Dongsoo1 aLim, Yoongho1 aLee, Young Han0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2013 Dec. 26, v. 61, no. 51 p.12588-12597dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-51187nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fjf40346883Available from publisher's site 7aarticle03588naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002800148245011600176300001800292520222500310592002802535650001502563650001102578650001902589650002202608650001602630650001602646650001502662650002102677650000902698650001102707650001602718650001802734650001602752650002102768650001702789650002002806651000902826700006602835700002302901773012602924856008303050852000903133655001203142IND60784318320221118073554.0220726e202207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078431832DNAL7 a10.1007/s11269-022-03195-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMoghadam, Seyedeh Hadis10aOptimal Water Allocation of Surface and Ground Water Resources Under Climate Change with WEAP and IWOA Modeling  ap. 3181-3205.  aThe water evaluation and planning (WEAP) approach and the invasive weed optimization algorithm (IWOA) are herein employed to determine the optimal operating policies in conjunctive (surface water/groundwater) systems for water supply in agricultural municipal/industrial (M&I) sectors under climate change. Climatic variables are simulated with atmospheric-ocean general circulation models (AOGCMs) under emission scenarios A2 and B2 during the baseline period 1971–2000 and the future periods 2040–2069 and 2070–2099 in the Khorramabad basin, Iran. The Hadley Centre Coupled Model, version 3 (HadCM3), and the Canadian Global Coupled Model, version 2 (CGCM2), produced superior temperature and rainfall projections, respectively, than other climate models. Under both emissions scenarios and during each future period, this study indicates an increase in temperature and a decrease in rainfall. Simulations of surface water with the IHACRES (Identification of unit Hydrographs And Component flows from Rainfall, Evaporation and Streamflow data) calibrated model shows a decrease in the future runoff. The Groundwater Modeling System (GMS) calibrated software projects a decrease in water level and a decrease in recharge under climate change scenarios. Simulation results from IHACRES and GMS are input to the Water Evaluation and Planning (WEAP) system to develop operational policies for the combined use of water resources., The water-allocation reliability of the system is estimated with the WEAP system for 24 scenarios reflecting climate change scenarios assuming increases in water demand, ranging from 10 to 60% in agriculture and from 20 to 30% in the municipal and industrial (M&I) sector. The IWOA is applied to optimize the conjunctive system of water resources (i.e., surface water and groundwater). The objective function is to maximize the system's water allocation reliability. The range of optimal water-allocation reliability changes is between 3 and 16%, with the lowest increase corresponding to the baseline period for agricultural water demand, and the highest rise corresponding to an increase of 50% in water demand under the B2 emissions scenario in 2040–2069 for the M&I water sector.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3abasins 3aclimate change 3acomputer software 3aevaporation 3agroundwater 3ahydrograph 3ainvasive species 3arain 3arunoff 3astream flow 3asurface water 3atemperature 3awater allocation 3awater supply 3awater utilities 3aIran1 aAshofteh, Parisa-Sadat1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2561-05101 aLoaiciga, Hugo A.,0 tWater resources management.g2022 July, v. 36, no. 9 p.3181-3205dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl44305x0920-47417nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11269-022-03195-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02756naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245010300168300001600271520133900287592002801626650000801654650002001662650002401682650001701706650002101723650001501744650001001759650001301769650001601782650000901798650001001807650001901817650003601836650001301872650001601885650001701901650002701918653002001945653002701965653000901992700002102001700003402022773012402056856008502180852000902265655001202274IND60638070320221121175818.0190516e201906  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063807032DNAL7 a10.1016/j.plaphy.2019.04.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAmraee, Leila10a24-Epibrassinolide alters DNA cytosine methylation of Linum usitatissimum L. under salinity stress  ap. 478-484.  aSalinity is a common environmental challenge limiting worldwide agricultural crop yield. Plants employ epigenetic regulatory strategies, such as DNA methylation which relatively allows rapid adaptation to new conditions in response to environmental stresses. Brassinosteroids (BRs) are a novel group of phytohormones recognized as transcription and translation regulators which are able to mitigate the impact of environmental stresses on the plants. In the current investigation, the influence of salinity and 24-epibrassinolide (24-epiBL) was investigated on the extent and pattern of cytosine DNA methylation using methylation-sensitive amplified polymorphisms (MSAP) technique in flax. Upon NaCl (150 mM) exposure, total methylation of CCGG sequences was decreased in comparison to control plants, while 24-epiBL (10−8 M) induced total methylation under salinity stress. Sequencing and analysis of six randomly selected MSAP fragments detected genes involved in various biological and molecular processes such as vitamine B1 biosynthesis, protein targeting and localization, post-translational modification and gene regulation. In conclusion, 24-epiBL seed priming could play critical role in regulation of cellular and biological processes in response to salt stress by epigenetic modification and induction of methylation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aDNA methylation 3aLinum usitatissimum 3abiosynthesis 3abrassinosteroids 3acrop yield 3acrops 3acytosine 3aepigenetics 3aflax 3agenes 3aplant hormones 3apost-translational modification 3asalinity 3asalt stress 3aseed priming 3atranslation (genetics) 0aGene expression 0aLinum usitatissimum L. 0aMSAP1 aRahmani, Fatemeh1 aAbdollahi Mandoulakani, Babak0 tPlant physiology and biochemistry.g2019 June, v. 139 p.478-484dElsevier Masson SASwJournal:jnl41590x0981-94287nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.plaphy.2019.04.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02403naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100005800147245010500205300001600310500001900326520100600345592002801351650002201379650002301401650002401424650001001448650001601458650002001474650001701494650001801511653001301529653000901542653002601551700001401577700001901591700005601610700006201666700001901728700001601747773011601763856008101879852000901960655001201969IND60734488220221118220633.0210420e202105  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073448822DNAL7 a10.1017/S00311820210001962doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGao, Jiang-Mei1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8582-471910aInfection with Trypanosoma lewisi or Trypanosoma musculi may promote the spread of Toxoplasma gondii  ap. 703-711.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aToxoplasma gondii can infect almost all warm-blooded vertebrates with pathogensis being largely influenced by the host immune status. As important epidemiological hosts, rodents are globally distributed and are also commonly found infected with haemoflagellates, such as those in the genus Trypanosoma. We here address whether and how co-infection with trypanosomes can influence T. gondii infection in laboratory models. Rats of five strains, co-infected with T. lewisi and mice of four strains, co-infected with T. musculi, were found to be more or less susceptible to T. gondii infection, respectively, with corresponding increased or decreased brain cyst burdens. Downregulation of iNOS expression and decreased NO production or reverse were observed in the peritoneal macrophages of rats or mice, infected with trypanosomes, respectively. Trypanosoma lewisi and T. musculi can modulate host immune responses, either by enhancement or suppression and influence the outcome of Toxoplasma infection.  aPublisher supplied data 3aToxoplasma gondii 3aTrypanosoma lewisi 3aTrypanosoma musculi 3abrain 3amacrophages 3amixed infection 3aparasitology 3atoxoplasmosis 0aArginase 0aiNOS 0aperitoneal macrophage1 aYi, Si-Qi1 aGeng, Guo-Qing1 aXu, Zhi-Shen1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3754-98681 aHide, G.q(Geoff),1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3608-01751 aLun, Zhao-Rong1 aLai, De-Hua0 tParasitology.g2021 May, v. 148, no. 6 p.703-711dCambridge University PresswJournal:jnl45572x1469-81617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S00311820210001963Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03047naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002100152245017900173300001600352520141700368592002801785650002101813650002901834650002501863650001701888650001601905650001401921650001301935650001401948650001201962650001101974650001901985650001702004650001502021650001302036650001002049650001802059650001602077653001702093653001902110653002702129653002402156653002302180700003302203700002602236700003502262773013602297856008702433852000902520655001202529IND60744504320221120031805.0220205e20210901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074450432DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2021.07.0392doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTessaro, Larissa10aGelatin/chitosan based films loaded with nanocellulose from soybean straw and activated with “Pitanga” (Eugenia uniflora L.) leaf hydroethanolic extract in W/O/W emulsion  ap. 328-340.  aMechanical properties of biopolymer films can be a limitation for their application as packaging. Soybean straw crystalline nanocelluloses (NC) can act as reinforcement load to improve these material properties, and W/O/W double emulsion (DE) as encapsulating bioactive agents can contribute to produce active packaging. DE droplets were loaded with pitanga leaf (Eugenia uniflora L.) hydroethanolic extract. The mechanical, physicochemical, and barrier properties, and the microstructure of gelatin and/or chitosan films incorporated with NC or NC/DE were determined by classical methods. Film antioxidant activities were determined by ABTS and DPPH methods. The incorporation of NC/DE in gelatin and/or chitosan films (NC/DE films) changed the morphology of these films, which presented more heterogeneous air-side surfaces and cross-sections. They presented rougher topographies, notably greater resistance and stiffness, higher barrier properties to UV/Vis light and higher antioxidant activity than the NC films. Moisture content, solubility in water and water vapor permeability decreased due to the presence of DE. Overall, the NC/DE films improved all properties, when compared to the properties of NC films or those of films with only DE, from a previously published study. In spite of not having antimicrobial activity against the studied bacteria, NC/DE films did display a great antioxidant activity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEugenia uniflora 3aantimicrobial properties 3aantioxidant activity 3aantioxidants 3abiopolymers 3acellulose 3achitosan 3aemulsions 3agelatin 3aleaves 3amicrostructure 3apermeability 3asolubility 3asoybeans 3astraw 3awater content 3awater vapor 0aActive films 0aNanocomposites 0aAntimicrobial activity 0aMechanical property 0aBiopolymers blends1 aLourenço, Rodrigo Vinícius1 aMartelli-Tosi, Milena1 aSobral, Paulo José do Amaral,0 tInternational journal of biological macromolecules.g2021 Sept. 01, v. 186 p.328-340dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12340x0141-81307nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2021.07.0393Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02972naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245011000168300001600278520136100294592002801655650002001683650001101703650001301714650001201727650002201739650001701761650002401778650001001802650001101812650002001823650001501843650001901858650001301877650002801890650002101918650002501939650002601964650002201990650001702012650001702029653002402046653001902070653001102089700001402100700002302114700001902137700005602156773012402212856008502336852000902421655001202430IND60638070420221121212833.0190516e201906  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063807042DNAL7 a10.1016/j.plaphy.2019.04.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJia, Dongfeng13aAn apple (Malus domestica) NAC transcription factor enhances drought tolerance in transgenic apple plants  ap. 504-512.  aPlant NAC proteins constitute one of the largest transcription factor families. They play pivotal functions during responses to various abiotic stresses. However, knowledge on roles of NAC proteins in abiotic stress tolerance as well as corresponding mechanisms has not been fully studied in perennial woody plants, including domesticated apple (Malus domestica). In the present study, we characterized the role of apple MdNAC1 transcription factor in response to drought stress. Apple plants overexpressing MdNAC1 gene exhibited promoted tolerance to drought stress, as evident by reduced water loss and electrolyte leakage in leaves, and maintenance of photosynthesis and photosynthetic pigments content under drought conditions. In addition, the levels of malondialdehyde (MDA) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) were significantly lower for transgenic apple lines than those for nontransgenic plants under drought conditions. This was accompanied by higher activities of several antioxidant enzymes, such as superoxide dismutase (SOD), peroxidase (POD), and catalase (CAT), as well as increased expression of the associated genes in transgenic lines. Together, our results indicate that overexpression of the apple MdNAC1 gene enhances drought stress tolerance in apple plants by promoting higher photosynthesis and activities of ROS-scavenging enzymes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMalus domestica 3aapples 3acatalase 3adrought 3adrought tolerance 3aelectrolytes 3agene overexpression 3agenes 3aleaves 3amalondialdehyde 3aperoxidase 3aphotosynthesis 3apigments 3areactive oxygen species 3astress tolerance 3asuperoxide dismutase 3atranscription factors 3atransgenic plants 3awater stress 3awoody plants 0aAntioxidant enzymes 0aDrought stress 0aMdNAC11 aJiang, Qi1 avan Nocker, Steven1 aGong, Xiaoqing1 aMa, Fengwang1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0608-25210 tPlant physiology and biochemistry.g2019 June, v. 139 p.504-512dElsevier Masson SASwJournal:jnl41590x0981-94287nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.plaphy.2019.04.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02361naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001900143245010200162300001600264520128600280592002801566650001601594650001801610650001701628650001201645650001201657650001001669650000901679650000901688651001901697700002301716700002101739700002301760773012901783856007801912852000901990655001201999IND60764852420221118224105.0220904e20210415xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076485242DNAL7 a10.17221/188/2020-jfs2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDušek, David,10aNorway spruce production and static stability in IUFRO thinning experiments in the Czech Republic  ap. 185-194.  aDespite recent issues, Norway spruce remains the most important commercial tree species which might be demanded henceforth for its broadly utilizable wood. Even before foresters faced both the bark beetle outbreaks and spruce decline, spruce monospecific stands were known to be prone also to other damage due to snow and wind. On this basis, measures that help prevent such failures were looked for, which resulted in the establishment of international IUFRO experimental series focused on impacts of different thinning regimes on stability and production of spruce stands. The thinning treatments differed in numbers of trees removed and retained on the site when dominant height of crop trees was reached or allowable cut in non-crop trees was accumulated. Also effects of different width of skid trails were tested. The study summarizes the results from the two IUFRO experiments in the Czech Republic. Effects of thinning regimes on spruce were found positive though thinning reduced the total volume production of wood while improving crop-tree stability which enhanced production safety. Different widths of skid trails had no effect on wood increment. Early thinning of spruce can be used to prevent their damage. No such measure, however, can alleviate the spruce decline.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPicea abies 3aallowable cut 3abark beetles 3adecline 3aforests 3atrees 3awind 3awood 3aCzech Republic1 aNovak, Jiri Tibor,1 aKacálek, Dušan1 aSlodičák, Marian0 tJournal of Forest Science.g, v. 67, no. 4 p.185-194dCzech Academy of Agricultural ScienceswJournal:21419x1212-48347nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.17221/188/2020-jfs3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04578naa a2200661 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006100148245013000209300001800339520252200357592002802879650003802907650000902945650001702954650002002971650002502991650002303016650000903039650002903048650002503077650003003102650002203132650002003154650002203174650002903196650001203225650002603237650001103263650002603274650001803300650000903318650001203327650002803339650001603367650002003383650001703403650001003420651001003430651001203440700002303452700002003475700001603495700002103511700001903532700002403551700002103575700002003596700002103616700002103637773015403658856008303812852000903895655001203904IND60705935120221122121156.0210731e202007  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070593512DNAL7 a10.1007/s11367-019-01656-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHeller, Martin C.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9204-622210aEnvironmental analyses to inform transitions to sustainable diets in developing countries: case studies for Vietnam and Kenya  ap. 1183-1196.  aPURPOSE: Sustainable diets are an environmental, economic, and public health imperative, but identifying clear intervention points is challenging. Decision-making will require descriptive analyses from a variety of perspectives, even under the inevitable uncertainty introduced by limited data. This study uses existing data to provide a diet-level perspective on environmental impact from food production in the case study countries of Vietnam and Kenya. METHODS: FAO food supply data at decadal time steps were used as a proxy for national average diets in Vietnam and Kenya. We combined these data with estimates of the greenhouse gas emissions (GHGE) and water use impact associated with producing food commodities. Generic GHGE factors were derived from a survey of the life cycle assessment literature. Country- and commodity-specific blue water use estimates were used, reflecting country-of-origin for import-dominated commodities. The AWARE characterization model was used to offer a diet-associated water scarcity footprint. Trends in diet-associated environmental impacts were interpreted in light of diet shifts, economic development trends, and other factors. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Increasing per capita food supply in Vietnam, and in particular increases in meat, have led to rising diet-associated per capita GHGE. While supply of beef remains 5.2 times smaller than pork—the dominant meat—increases in beef demand in the past decade have resulted in it becoming second only to rice in contribution to diet GHGE. The water use and water scarcity footprint in Vietnam follow an increasing trend comparable to food supply. On the other hand, historically consistent levels of dairy and beef in Kenya dominate diet-level GHGE. Water use associated with the Kenyan diet shows marked increases between the 1990s and 2000s due to imports of wheat and rice from water-stressed regions. Environmental performance data for characteristic food production systems in these and other developing countries are needed to improve the representativeness and reliability of such assessments. CONCLUSIONS: Despite data limitations, the methods and results presented here may offer a fresh perspective in sustainable development policy deliberations, as they offer an entry point to linking environmental impact and consumption behaviors and can elucidate otherwise obscure or unexpected outcomes. A clear need emerges for further environmental analysis of dominant production systems within both Vietnam and Kenya.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFood and Agriculture Organization 3abeef 3acase studies 3adecision making 3adeveloping countries 3adevelopment policy 3adiet 3aenvironmental assessment 3aenvironmental impact 3aenvironmental performance 3afood availability 3afood production 3afood supply chain 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3aimports 3alife cycle assessment 3amodels 3aproduction technology 3apublic health 3arice 3asurveys 3asustainable development 3auncertainty 3awater shortages 3awater stress 3awheat 3aKenya 3aVietnam1 aWalchale, Abhijeet1 aHeard, Brent R.1 aHoey, Lesli1 aKhoury, Colin K.1 aHaan, Stef de,1 aBurra, Dharani Dhar1 aDuong, Thi Thanh1 aOsiemo, Jamleck1 aTrinh, Thi Huong1 aJones, Andrew D.0 tinternational journal of life cycle assessment.g2020 July, v. 25, no. 7 p.1183-1196dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:J000000330x0948-33497nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11367-019-01656-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03025naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002300150245015700173300001600330520144800346592002801794650000901822650001301831650001801844650001301862650002101875650003001896650000901926650001701935650001001952653002201962653002001984653003302004653002102037653000802058700002602066700006702092700001902159700005502178700002302233700005902256700002202315773012402337856008502461852000902546655001202555IND60638070520221121175814.0190516e201906  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063807052DNAL7 a10.1016/j.plaphy.2019.04.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTrifilò, Patrizia10aHydraulic recovery from xylem embolism in excised branches of twelve woody species: Relationships with parenchyma cells and non-structural carbohydrates  ap. 513-520.  aEmbolism repair ability has been documented in numerous species. Although the actual mechanism driving this phenomenon is still debated, experimental findings suggest that non-structural carbohydrates (NSC) stored in wood parenchyma would provide the osmotic forces to drive the refilling of embolized conduits.We selected 12 broadleaved species differing in vulnerability to xylem embolism (P50) and amount of wood parenchyma in order to check direct evidence about the possible link(s) between parenchyma cells abundance, NSC availability and species-specific capacity to reverse xylem embolism.Branches were dehydrated until ∼50% loss of hydraulic conductivity was recorded (PLC ∼50%). Hydraulic recovery (ΔPLC) and NSC content was, then, assessed after 1h of rehydration.Species showed a different ability to recover their hydraulic conductivity from PLC∼50%. Removing the bark in the species showing hydraulic recovery inhibited the embolism reversal. Strong correlations between the ΔPLC and: a) the amount of parenchyma cells (mainly driven by the pith area), b) the consumption of soluble NSC have been recorded.Our results support the hypothesis that refilling of embolized vessels is mediated by the mobilization of soluble NSC and it is mainly recorded in species with a higher percentage of parenchyma cells that may be important in the hydraulic recovery mechanism as a source of carbohydrates and/or as a source of water.  aPublisher supplied data 3abark 3abranches 3acarbohydrates 3aembolism 3aosmotic pressure 3aparenchyma (plant tissue) 3apith 3awoody plants 3axylem 0aHydraulic failure 0aEmbolism repair 0aNon-structural carbohydrates 0aParenchyma cells 0aP501 aKiorapostolou, Natasa1 aPetruzzellis, Francesco1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3635-85011 aVitti, Stefano1 aPetit, Giai1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6546-71411 aLo Gullo, Maria A.1 aNardini, Andrea1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5208-00871 aCasolo, Valentino0 tPlant physiology and biochemistry.g2019 June, v. 139 p.513-520dElsevier Masson SASwJournal:jnl41590x0981-94287nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.plaphy.2019.04.0133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02595naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002000164245013500184300001600319520066100335592002800996650002801024650001901052650001101071650001601082650001001098650001501108650001201123650001901135650001001154650001301164650001301177650002001190650001201210650003001222650004501252650003001297650003701327650003101364650003701395650001901432650003601451650002801487650003501515650000901550650003301559650002101592650005101613650003601664650003001700700002101730700002301751773012901774856008101903852000901984655001201993IND4407502020221120123258.0151023e200806  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440750202DNAL7 a185512382pmid7 a10.1007/s00128-008-9467-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPaden, Norka E.10aAcute toxicity of 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene, 2,4-dinitrotoluene, and 2,6-dinitrotoluene in the adult bullfrog (Lithobates catesbeiana)  ap. 487-491.  a2,4,6-Trinitrotoluene (TNT) is one of the most prevalent high explosives in the environment. 2,4-Dinitrotoluene (2,4-DNT) and 2,6-dinitrotoluene (2,6-DNT) are the most common isoforms of dinitrotoluene.

The aim of this study was to determine the presence of Brucella suis, Campylobacter jejuni, and of Escherichia coli in feces of feral pigs from Georgia. Fecal samples were collected from 87 feral pigs from forested and agricultural regions of Georgia. DNA was extracted from the fecal samples and quantitative PCR (qPCR) was used to screen for each of the four pathogens. The qPCR assays indicated that B. suis and eaeA-containing strains of E. coli was present in about 22% and 28% of the samples, respectively. C. jejuni was undetected in any of the feral pig fecal samples. The incidence of B. suis was higher in the pigs from forested region, whereas E. coli strains possessing eaeA gene incidence was higher in the pigs from agricultural regions. In Georgia, feral pigs harbor infectious agents and are a growing threat to the transmission of pathogens to native wildlife, humans, and food crops.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBrucella melitensis biovar Suis 3aCampylobacter jejuni 3aDNA 3aEscherichia coli 3aSus scrofa 3adisease transmission 3afeces 3aferal animals 3afood crops 3agenes 3ainvasive species 3apathogens 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3aswine 3awildlife 3aGeorgia 0aferal pigs 0azoonotic pathogens 0aBrucella suis1 aBachoon, Dave S.0 tVector borne and zoonotic diseases.g2018 July 01, v. 18, no. 7 p.350-355dMary Ann Liebert, Inc.wJournal:J000000160x1557-77597nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1089/vbz.2017.21873Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02690naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002200148245009700170300001800267520150900285592002801794650003001822650001301852650001701865650002601882650002501908650001601933650002201949650002401971650001801995651001202013700006102025700002402086773012602110856008302236852000902319655001202328IND60784318620221118072747.0220726e202207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078431862DNAL7 a10.1007/s11269-022-03156-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAbd-Elaty, Ismail10aInclined Physical Subsurface Barriers for Saltwater Intrusion Management in Coastal Aquifers  ap. 2973-2987.  aSaltwater intrusion (SWI) has a negative environmental impact on groundwater quality in coastal areas. Therefore, effective management strategies are required to preserve fresh groundwater resources. Historically, vertical barriers have been exclusively considered in both numerical studies and practical applications. The novelty of this study consists in investigating the SWI mitigation effectiveness of inclined physical subsurface barriers (PSBs), and specifically cutoff walls (CWs) and subsurface dams (SDs). An initial benchmark analysis of the Henry problem was performed. Following verification, the proposed model was applied to a real case study - the Biscayne aquifer (Southeastern Florida, USA). The model simulations run for different scenarios considering the vertical placement of the PSB, an inclined placement of the PSB according to different slopes (1/4, 1/2 and 1/1, at sea- and landside) and the combination of the best scenario. The results showed that CWs are more effective in limiting SWI in comparison with SDs. The most positive impact in both cases was achieved for a slope of 1/4, indicating that a moderate vertical inclination of the PSB better preserve coastal groundwater resources. The model presented in this work can be a valuable tool for policy makers in predicting the coastal aquifer response. However, a comprehensive cost–benefit analysis is required to further account for the feasibility and the economic costs related to the construction of inclined PSBs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadministrative management 3aaquifers 3acase studies 3acost benefit analysis 3aenvironmental impact 3agroundwater 3aissues and policy 3asaltwater intrusion 3awater quality 3aFlorida1 aPugliese, Lorenzo1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3397-46801 aStraface, Salvatore0 tWater resources management.g2022 July, v. 36, no. 9 p.2973-2987dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl44305x0920-47417nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11269-022-03156-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02628naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001600148245016400164300001800328520140500346592002801751650003001779650001601809650001201825650001101837650001001848651001301858700001801871700001801889700001701907700001701924700001501941700002401956700001801980700002601998773012602024856008302150852000902233655001202242IND60784318720221118072734.0220726e202207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078431872DNAL7 a10.1007/s11269-022-03159-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAli, Farman10aExploring Regional Profile of Drought History- a New Procedure to Characterize and Evaluate Multi-Scaler Drought Indices Under Spatial Poisson Log-Normal Model  ap. 2989-3005.  aDrought is recurrently occurring in many parts of the globe. In contrast to other natural hazards, drought has complex climatic characteristics. Several environmental factors are involved in the occurrence of drought hazards. However, the selection of an appropriate drought index may incorporate to make efficient drought mitigation policies. Moreover, the spatial distributions of extreme weather conditions (Dry/Wet) are necessary to avoid the consequences of future drought hazards. In this study, we aimed to explore and compare the regional profile of Dry/Wet episodes under various drought measures. Consequently, this research proposes a new spatial comparative procedure to assess and evaluate the spatial predictive distributions of Dry/Wet episodes under various drought measures. The study incorporates three Standardized Drought Indices (SDIs) and a spatial Poisson log-normal model to assess and evaluate the spatial predictive distributions of Dry/Wet episodes in Pakistan. Results of this study show that the segregated patterns of Dry/Wet counts are moderately consistent with the climatology of the region. However, the spatial patterns of Wet/Dry counts under various drought measures are significantly different under each index. Therefore, this research suggests the simultaneous use of multiple drought measures for accurate and precise drought monitoring at the regional level.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadministrative management 3aclimatology 3adrought 3amodels 3awater 3aPakistan1 aAli, Zulfiqar1 aLi, Bing-Zhao1 aQamar, Sadia1 aNazeer, Amna1 aRiaz, Saba1 aKhan, Muhammad Asif1 aFayyaz, Rabia1 aNawaz Abbasi, Javeria0 tWater resources management.g2022 July, v. 36, no. 9 p.2989-3005dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl44305x0920-47417nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11269-022-03159-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02219naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001500151245012400166300001600290520105300306592002801359650002501387650001601412650001501428650001101443650001401454650001501468653001701483653001601500653002201516653002401538653002401562700001701586700002301603773012501626856008501751852000901836655001201845IND60331831220221119045015.0150727e20150703xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6033183122DNAL7 a10.1080/15715124.2015.10122072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKim, Sinae10aGeomorphological and riparian vegetation responses following a low-head dam removal: a study based on literature review  ap. 315-324.  aMore and more low-head dam structures have deteriorated in recent years. Unlike the large dam, the geomorphological and ecological impacts of a low-head dam removal have not been quantified with insufficient monitoring data on pre- and post-removal. Therefore, this study intends to identify the low-head dam removal impacts on geomorphology and riparian vegetation based on previous studies. The characteristics of stored sediment in the impoundment play a critical role for geomorphological responses on a low-head dam removal creating a knickpoint and promoting a headcut migration. These geomorphological changes often form a new floodplain and create enough room for riparian vegetation establishment. The river geomorphology after a low-head dam removal can be a state of quasi-equilibrium within about a decade. In this state, a newly formed floodplain tends to be colonized by riparian vegetation in many low-head dam removal cases. After a decade to several decades, the riparian vegetation in the floodplain often develops to tree plants.  aPublisher supplied data 3aenvironmental impact 3afloodplains 3amonitoring 3arivers 3asediments 3avegetation 0aLow-head dam 0adam removal 0achannel evolution 0ariver geomorphology 0ariparian vegetation1 aToda, Yūji,1 aTsujimoto, Tetsuro0 tInternational journal of river basin management.g2015 July 3, v. 13, no. 3 p.315-324dTaylor & Francisx1814-20607nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15715124.2015.10122073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03283naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100002500155245009200180300001600272520169600288592002801984650002802012650001102040650001902051650002002070650000902090650001002099650001102109650001202120650003202132650001402164650001402178650000902192650002802201650001102229650002002240650001102260651001302271653001602284653002602300653002202326653001402348700002602362700002002388700003102408700001702439700001902456700001902475700002402494773011202518856009002630852000902720655001202729IND60582080020221120054353.0190405e201710  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058208002DNAL7 a10.1016/j.anireprosci.2017.08.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMura, Maria Consuelo10aMelatonin treatment in winter and spring and reproductive recovery in Sarda breed sheep  ap. 104-108.  aThis study aimed to evaluate the effect of melatonin treatment carried out between late winter and early spring on reproductive response in Sarda breed sheep and whether the photo-refractoriness can influence this reproductive response. The study was conducted on 3200 adult ewes, aged 3–6years old, with body condition score (BCS) 2.5–4.0, from 16 commercial sheep farms in Northern Sardinia. In each farm 200 animals were enrolled and subdivided into 2 groups (n=100 each): Group M (treated with one 18mg melatonin implant), and group C (untreated). The melatonin treatments were performed on 10th February; 10th March; 10th April and on 10th May each time in 4 different randomly selected farms. Adult males, treated with 3 melatonin implants 1 week before females, were introduced in each flock 35days after ewes’ treatment, and removed after 45days of cohabitation with females. Pregnancy was determined by transabdominal ultrasonography examination between 45th and 90th day after ram introduction. Data showed that melatonin treatment increased the fertility rate significantly (P<0.05), with the higher fertility rate in the ewes treated in April and May. The average time in days from male introduction to lambing was shorter in treated than in control ewes (P<0.05). Further, at the 160th and 170th day after male introduction the group M showed a higher number of lambed ewes compared to C (P<0.01). This effect was observed at 180th and 190th days after ram introduction, also, but with lower significance (P<0.05). In conclusion, melatonin treatment improved reproductive efficiency and advanced breeding season in Sarda sheep, especially when ewes were treated in spring.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSardinian (sheep breed) 3aadults 3abody condition 3abreeding season 3aewes 3afarms 3aflocks 3alambing 3alivestock and meat industry 3amelatonin 3apregnancy 3arams 3areproductive efficiency 3aspring 3aultrasonography 3awinter 3aSardinia 0aSarda sheep 0aSeasonal reproduction 0aMelatonin implant 0aFertility1 aLuridiana, Sebastiano1 aFarci, Federico1 aDi Stefano, Maria Veronica1 aDaga, Cinzia1 aPulinas, Luisa1 aStarič, Jože1 aCarcangiu, Vincenzo0 tAnimal reproduction science.g2017 Oct., v. 185 p.104-108dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl11636x0378-43207nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.anireprosci.2017.08.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03860naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100006100151245017400212506011700386506007600503520187700579592002802456506003702484650001302521650001002534650002202544650000902566650002202575650002002597650002602617650001602643650001102659650001302670650002802683650001302711650000902724651001002733653001602743653002102759653001002780653002802790653001002818653002402828653002702852653002402879700001802903700001802921700002102939700002002960700002102980700002203001700005903023773009303082856008603175852000903261655001203270IND60779188720221207105643.0220906e202206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077918872DNAL7 a10.1016/j.heliyon.2022.e095662doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGautam, Samikshya1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3828-586010aField evaluation of slow-release nitrogen fertilizers and real-time nitrogen management tools to improve grain yield and nitrogen use efficiency of spring maize in Nepal  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aSeveral innovative fertilizers and application methods, along with different decision support tools have been developed to improve nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) and crop yields, but their comparative study in maize is yet to be done in Nepal. Thus, we evaluated different slow-release N fertilizers and decision-making tools for real-time N management compared with the common urea on their effectiveness in increasing NUE, grain yield and economic return of spring maize (Zea mays L. cv. Rampur Hybrid-10). A field trial was conducted at Dang Valley of Nepal in a Randomized complete block design with three replications and seven treatments; N omission- (0 kg N ha⁻¹), normal urea at 120 kg N ha⁻¹ (recommended dose, N120), and 180 kg N ha⁻¹(N180), Polymer Coated Urea (PCU- 90 kg N ha⁻¹), Urea Briquette-deep placement (UDP- 90 kg N ha⁻¹), GreenSeeker (GS- 143 kg N ha⁻¹) and Leaf Color Chart based N management (LCC- 143 kg N ha⁻¹). N application based on decision support tools (LCC and GS) and innovative fertilizers (UDP, PCU) yielded 17.35–45.81% more grain yield than recommended dose (RDF). The real time nitrogen application through LCC and GreenSeeker and slow release N fertilizer (PCU and UDP) resulted in higher agronomic efficiency of nitrogen- AEN (21.30–27.82 kg grain kg⁻¹ N) compared to RDF (12.15 kg grain kg⁻¹ N) and N180 (19.87 kg grain kg⁻¹ N). UDP, with 25% less N compared to RDF, resulted in higher grain yield (5.25 t ha⁻¹), partial factor productivity of N– PFPN (58.37 kg grain kg⁻¹ N) and AEN (27.82 kg grain kg⁻¹ N). Based on the economic return and ease in the application, both UDP and LCC based N application seem promising in Nepalese conditions. However, their effectiveness should be validated across diverse agro-ecologies, soil types and climatic conditions for a general recommendation.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aZea mays 3acolor 3acomparative study 3acorn 3acosts and returns 3adecision making 3afield experimentation 3agrain yield 3aleaves 3anitrogen 3anutrient use efficiency 3apolymers 3aurea 3aNepal 0aGreenSeeker 0aLeaf color chart 0aMaize 0aNitrogen use efficiency 0aNepal 0aPolymer coated urea 0aReal-time N Management 0aUrea deep placement1 aTiwari, Ujjal1 aSapkota, Bina1 aŚarmā, Bālā,1 aParajuli, Sapna1 aPandit, Naba Raj1 aGaihre, Yam Kanta1 aDhakal, Krishna1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9601-64930 tHeliyon.g2022 June, v. 8, no. 6 p.e09566-dElsevier LtdwJournal:23264x2405-84407nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2022.e095663Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02935naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002400151245010500175300001600280520141500296592002801711650001601739650002201755650003001777650002701807650002101834650001501855650002101870650001401891650001101905650001501916650001601931650001101947650002601958650001801984651001002002653002302012653003902035653002602074653003402100700002102134700001902155700002702174700002102201773012502222856008502347852000902432655001202441IND60331831320221119045035.0150727e20150703xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6033183132DNAL7 a10.1080/15715124.2015.10122082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aValeriani, Federica10aRiver water quality assessment: comparison between old and new indices in a real scenario from Italy  ap. 325-331.  aAccording to the European Water Framework Directive, Italy introduced two aggregate indices for evaluating the ecological status of rivers, called respectively LIM (Pollution Level of the Macro-descriptors) from 2000 to 2008, and LIM ₑcₒ from 2010 onwards. The LIM index considered the % of Dissolved Oxygen (DO%), ammonium nitrogen (NH ₄-N), nitrate nitrogen (NO ₃-N), total phosphorus (P), Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD ₅), Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD), and Escherichia (E.) coli , while LIM ₑcₒ considered only DO%, NH ₄-N, NO ₃-N, and total P. The aim of this study was to evaluate differences between LIM and LIM ₑcₒ for defining quality status of freshwaters. For this purpose, data obtained during an annual monitoring campaign of four main rivers of southern Italy were used to calculate both indices. LIM ₑcₒ seems to return the quality status of a river better than LIM when the state of the water body is more compromised, while there is a substantial consistency when the river quality is at a medium/high level. Indeed, LIM intended to give a ‘traditional’ classification of freshwaters, integrating environmental and ecological descriptors, while LIM ₑcₒ focuses on the trophic status of freshwaters, considering only nutrients and oxygen, essential for the aquatic biological communities and it does not consider organic load and microbiological contamination.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia 3aammonium nitrogen 3abiochemical oxygen demand 3achemical oxygen demand 3adissolved oxygen 3amonitoring 3anitrate nitrogen 3anutrients 3aoxygen 3aphosphorus 3ariver water 3arivers 3atrophic relationships 3awater quality 3aItaly 0aFreshwater quality 0aEuropean Water Framework Directive 0aecological assessment 0afreshwater ecological indices1 aZinnà, Loredana1 aVitali, Matteo1 aRomano Spica, Vincenzo1 aProtano, Carmela0 tInternational journal of river basin management.g2015 July 3, v. 13, no. 3 p.325-331dTaylor & Francisx1814-20607nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15715124.2015.10122083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03689naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002300143245017500166300001600341520190400357592002802261650003002289650002802319650002702347650001902374650002502393650001102418650002302429650001202452650001302464650001102477650002002488650001102508650001402519650002102533650001702554650001902571650001002590650001302600651001202613653001702625653001902642653003102661653004502692700002102737700001902758700002102777700001802798700001902816700002902835700002102864773013902885856007803024852000903102655001203111IND60657982220221123025951.0190919e20180701xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065798222DNAL7 a10.1089/vbz.2017.22212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRaileanu, Cristian10aMolecular Evidence of Rickettsia spp., Anaplasma phagocytophilum, and “Candidatus Neoehrlichia mikurensis” in Ticks from Natural and Urban Habitats in Eastern Romania  ap. 343-349.  aIxodid ticks are competent vectors for multiple pathogens, several of which cause infections in human. The medical importance of tick-borne pathogens is well known, yet unanswered questions remain regarding the occurrence of pathogens such as Rickettsia spp., Anaplasma phagocytophilum, and “Candidatus Neoehrlichia mikurensis” in questing ticks in Romania. Our objectives were to identify three emerging tick-borne zoonotic pathogens in eastern Romania, to assess their prevalence, establish co-infection rates, and to compare infection levels of selected pathogens in questing ticks collected from one suburban area in the city of Iaşi and one forested area located in the Danube Delta Biosphere Reserve. We collected 490 questing nymphs or adult ticks (467 Ixodes ricinus, 4 Dermacentor reticulatus, and 19 Haemaphysalis punctata). We individually analyzed ticks for the presence of Rickettsia spp., A. phagocytophilum, and “C. N. mikurensis.” Rickettsia spp. was detected in 9.4% of ticks from both sampling areas. Rickettsia spp. included R. helvetica (n = 17 I. ricinus ticks), R. monacensis (n = 28 I. ricinus ticks), and R. raoultii (n = 1 D. reticulatus). “C. N. mikurensis” had an infection rate of 4.9% while A. phagocytophilum was detected only in the forested area with a global prevalence of 1.2%. The overall prevalence of ticks infected with at least one pathogen was 15.5%, and 5.3% of infected ticks were tested positives for dual pathogen association. Our study documents the presence of pathogens in questing ticks in the urban recreational areas of Iaşi and forested areas located in the Danube Delta Biosphere Reserve. Worth mentioning, is the presence of “C.

The study utilizes key environmental degradation indicators: Carbon dioxide (CO₂) emissions, ecological footprints (EFs), and Nitrous Oxide (NO) emissions, and a panel dataset of 15 emerging countries for the period 2002–2019 to undertake an empirical investigation. The pooled mean group (PMG)-ARDL estimator, Fully Modified OLS (FMOLS), Dynamic OLS (DOLS) and Augmented Mean Group (AMG) methods have been applied as empirical investigation techniques. The empirical findings reveal that in the long-run informal economic activities positively affect the environmental quality with fewer recorded emissions of CO₂ and EFs while these activities affect negatively to NO emissions. This study has also found that corruption control improves environmental quality by reducing EFs and NO emissions but works to the opposite by increasing recorded CO₂ emissions. An increase in economic growth and renewable energy consumption improves environmental quality in emerging countries, while consumption of non-renewable energy degrades the environmental quality. The robust empirical findings advocate policy initiatives for intense monitoring of informal activities and implementation of indirect tax policy to regulate informal activities and the pollution they cause. Careful measures of corruption control and initiatives to bring the informal economic activities into a formal framework are suggested to reduce CO₂ and NO emissions. An increase in economic growth with more focus on renewables and phasing out non-renewables can ensure green growth in emerging countries.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3acarbon dioxide 3adata collection 3aenergy 3aenvironmental quality 3aissues and policy 3anitrous oxide 3anonrenewable resources 3apollution 3arenewable energy sources 3asocioeconomics 0aCO2 emissions 0aEcological footprints 0aEconomic growth 0aInformal economy 0aRenewable and non-renewable energy 0aCorruption control1 aRahman, Mohammad Mafizur1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7950-19611 aKhanam, Rasheda1 aKabir, Zobaidul0 tHeliyon.g2022 June, v. 8, no. 6 p.e09569-dElsevier LtdwJournal:23264x2405-84407nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2022.e095693Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02974naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005100148245010100199300001200300520160700312592002801919596007301947650004402020650000802064650002402072650001402096650002302110650001402133650001102147650001402158650001002172650001902182650001802201650001202219650001002231650001802241650001302259700001902272700001602291773014102307856008302448852000902531655001202540IND60784319120221118072758.0220826e202208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078431912DNAL7 a10.1007/s11270-022-05781-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXia, Ke1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9946-704610aSuper Stability of Cu-Mn/Y Bimetallic Catalyst for Ozone-assisted Catalytic Oxidation of Toluene  ap. 297.  aUnsatisfactory performance and poor lifetime encountered by most catalysts severely confine their advancement in practical applications. Herein, the metallic oxide catalysts employing Y zeolite as support were prepared by the impregnation method to address these obstacles in catalytic oxidation of toluene with ozone. The results show that Cu-Mn/Y bimetallic catalyst (CM-Y) possesses relatively high toluene conversion and ozone decomposition efficiency at room temperature because of the high reduction ability and enhanced mobility of oxygen in comparison with those of the monometallic catalysts. Furthermore, the effects of the key operating parameters (O₃/C₇H₈ volume ratio, moisture content, and reaction temperature) were investigated over the CM-Y catalyst. And the results suggest that the minimum O₃/C₇H₈ volume ratio of 10 and reaction temperature of 100 ℃ were required to obtain high catalytic activity and steady-state ozonation of toluene. The splendid toluene conversion of ~ 97.5% and COₓ selectivity of ~ 98.5% could be achieved under the optimal reaction conditions after the 500 h toluene oxidation reaction. Moreover, only < 0.04 ppm ozone could be detected in the outlet gas. Aforementioned results were also reasonably verified by various characterizations including H₂-temperature-programmed reduction (H₂-TPR), gas chromatography-mass spectrometer (GC–MS), and Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy. CM-Y catalyst reveals a promising application prospect in ozone-assisted catalytic oxidation for VOC removal at low temperatures.  aPublisher supplied data  a20XD1431700cProgram of Shanghai Academic/Technology Research Leader 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aair 3aambient temperature 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3aoxidation 3aoxygen 3aozonation 3aozone 3asoil pollution 3aspectrometers 3atoluene 3awater 3awater content 3azeolites1 aHuang, Jin-Hua1 aYe, Li-Ping0 tWater, air, and soil pollution.g2022 Aug., v. 233, no. 8 p.297-297dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:jnl4876x0049-69797nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11270-022-05781-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02869naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001400147245007700161300001600238520168300254592002801937650002501965650001901990650004902009650001702058650001402075650002702089650000902116650001302125650001702138650002002155650002002175650002502195650001402220700001702234700001802251773011202269856008102381852000902462655001202471IND60098108220221120032704.0141104e201209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009810822DNAL7 a10.1016/j.etp.2010.11.0142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFeng, Pei10aInfluence of selenium and fluoride on blood antioxidant capacity of rats  ap. 565-568.  aThis study is to explore the effect of selenium and fluoride on blood antioxidant capacity of rats, and try to find out the optimal level of selenium in drinking water against fluorosis. Animals were divided into control group, sodium fluoride treated group (NaF, 50mg/L) and selenium+NaF treated group (sodium selenite 0.375, 0.75, 1.5mg/L) in water were respectively administered to male rats, which were decapitated after 6 months. Their blood was collected for GSH-Px activity, plasma SOD activity, T-AOC assay, uric acid assay, sialic acid (SA) content and MDA content, and the fluidity of erythrocyte membrane by electron spin resonance (ESR) was analyzed. The results showed that, compared with the control group, the blood antioxidant capacity of the rats exposed to fluoride was down-regulated significantly (P<0.05, P<0.01), MDA content increased significantly (P<0.05), the fluidity of erythrocyte membrane decreased (P<0.05, P<0.01). Meanwhile, the treatments of selenium along with NaF compared with fluorosis group, SOD activity, GSH-Px activity and T-AOC assay increased respectively, MDA content decreased significantly (P<0.05) in NaF+Se (Se 0.75, 1.5mg/L) treated groups, uric acid level was up-regulated, but had no statistical significant difference (P>0.05). The fluidity of erythrocyte membrane showed significant increase (P<0.05), the content of SA was lower. Fluorosis could induce the decline of blood antioxidant capacity and the fluidity of erythrocyte membrane, as evident in this study, and Se at different levels possess some antagonistic effects on blood induced by fluoride. However, high dose of selenium (1.5mg/L) is the optimum concentration.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantioxidant activity 3adrinking water 3aelectron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aerythrocytes 3afluorosis 3aglutathione peroxidase 3arats 3aselenium 3asialic acids 3asodium fluoride 3asodium selenite 3asuperoxide dismutase 3auric acid1 aWei, Jun-ren1 aZhang, Zi-gui0 tExperimental and toxicologic pathology.g2012 Sept., v. 64, no. 6 p.565-568dElsevier GmbHx0940-29937nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.etp.2010.11.0143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02633naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001300147245016900160300001800329520148400347592002801831650001601859650002801875650001001903650002001913650001201933650002001945650001701965650001101982650001601993651001002009700001302019700001402032700001302046773011002059856008102169852000902250655001202259IND60519505320221123042358.0160501e201606  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051950532DNAL7 a10.1007/s10811-015-0707-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXu, Feng10aInterspecific variation in extracellular polysaccharide content and colony formation of Microcystis spp. cultured under different light intensities and temperatures  ap. 1533-1541.  aSingle cells of five different Microcystis species (M. ichthyoblabe, M. viridis, M. flos-aquae, M. wesenbergii, and M. aeruginosa) were batch-cultured at different temperatures and light intensities: (a) 25 °C and 50 μmol photons m⁻² s⁻¹ (control culture); (b) 25 °C and 10 μmol photons m⁻² s⁻¹; and (c) 15 °C and 50 μmol photons m⁻² s⁻¹. The extracellular polysaccharide content was significantly higher in treatments b and c than in the control treatment. All Microcystis species existed as single cells under the control treatment but formed colonies in treatments b and c. All of the colonies were irregular with indistinct margins. M. ichthyoblabe, M. viridis, M. flos-aquae, and M. wesenbergii formed colonies with similar morphologies and their cells were loosely aggregated. In contrast, M. aeruginosa formed denser colonies with no distinct holes. The colony morphologies differed from the classic morphology of M. ichthyoblabe field-grown colonies but resembled that of small colonies found in Lake Taihu (Yangtze Delta Plain, China) during early spring. This indicates that field- and laboratory-grown colonies are governed by similar formation processes. We suggest that in laboratory and field environments, M. ichthyoblabe (or M. flos-aquae) colonies are representative of small colonies formed from single Microcystis cells, whereas the morphology of older colonies evolves to resemble M. wesenbergii and M. aeruginosa colonies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMicrocystis 3ainterspecific variation 3alakes 3alight intensity 3aphotons 3apolysaccharides 3ariver deltas 3aspring 3atemperature 3aChina1 aZhu, Wei1 aXiao, Man1 aLi, Ming0 tJournal of applied phycology.g2016 June, v. 28, no. 3 p.1533-1541dSpringer Netherlandsx0921-89717nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10811-015-0707-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03287naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002600143245014000169300001600309520163800325592002801963650002201991650001502013650001602028650002802044650003802072650001202110650002102122650002102143650002502164650001302189650002402202650001902226650001202245651001502257653001602272653002002288700002602308700002102334700002302355700002502378700001602403700002002419700002602439700002102465700002402486700002102510773013902531856007802670852000902748655001202757IND60657982420221121032825.0190919e20180601xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065798242DNAL7 a10.1089/vbz.2017.22272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAntónio, Virgilio S.10aSeroepidemiology of Chikungunya Virus Among Febrile Patients in Eight Health Facilities in Central and Northern Mozambique, 2015–2016  ap. 311-316.  aBackground: The burden and spread of chikungunya virus (CHIKV) are rapidly increasing worldwide, but the epidemiology in Mozambique is barely known. The aim of this study was to determine the seroepidemiology of CHIKV in central and northern Mozambique. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted between March 2015 and May 2016 in eight health facilities situated in central and northern Mozambique to recruit 392 patients with undifferentiated febrile illness from outpatient clinics. Serum samples from each participant were screened using commercially available enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for detection of anti-CHIK IgM and IgG antibodies. A subset of study samples (n = 37) was further tested by the plaque reduction neutralization assay (PRNT). Results: The median age of participants was 23 years (IQR: 7–34), and 45.7% were female. The frequency of participants with seropositivity for IgM and IgG anti-CHIKV antibodies was 1.5% (6/392) and 28.6% (112/392), respectively. Patients with seropositivity for IgM anti-CHIKV were significantly younger. Frequency of patients with seropositivity for IgG anti-CHIKV increased with age. Frequency of patients with seropositivity for IgM anti-CHIKV was higher in Tete province, but most patients with seropositivity for IgG anti-CHIKV infection were from Cabo Delgado and Sofala provinces. Conclusions: Our data demonstrate serological evidence of CHIKV in central and northern Mozambique, expanding the limited evidence of the virus in the country. We recommend that CHIKV should be considered in the differential diagnosis of febrile illness throughout the country.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChikungunya virus 3aantibodies 3ablood serum 3across-sectional studies 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3afemales 3aimmunoglobulin G 3aimmunoglobulin M 3aneutralization tests 3apatients 3aserological surveys 3aseroprevalence 3aviruses 3aMozambique 0achikungunya 0afebrile illness1 aMuianga, Argentina F.1 aWieseler, Janett1 aPereira, Sádia A.1 aMonteiro, Vanessa O.1 aMula, Flora1 aChelene, Imelda1 aChongo, Inocêncio S.1 aOludele, John O.1 aKümmerer, Beate M.1 aGudo, Eduardo S.0 tVector borne and zoonotic diseases.g2018 June 01, v. 18, no. 6 p.311-316dMary Ann Liebert, Inc.wJournal:J000000160x1557-77597nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1089/vbz.2017.22273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03717naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002800150245016200178300001600340520202200356592002802378650001602406650002002422650001702442650000902459650001302468650001002481650002102491650001102512650001802523650001702541650003702558650001102595650001402606653004602620653003502666653001302701653002702714653001102741653000802752653000802760653000802768653000902776653000902785653000902794653000902803653000802812700001802820700002502838700007002863773012402933856008503057852000903142655001203151IND60638071320221121212738.0190516e201906  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063807132DNAL7 a10.1016/j.plaphy.2019.04.0292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJakubowicz, Małgorzata10aExpression profiling of CTR1-like and EIN2-like genes in buds and leaves of Populus tremula, and in vitro study of the interaction between their polypeptides  ap. 660-671.  aIn Arabidopsis, the serine/threonine protein kinase Constitutive Triple Response 1 (CTR1) and Ethylene Insensitive 2 polypeptide (EIN2) functions are key negative and positive components, respectively, in the ethylene signalling route. Here, we report on an in silico study of members of the CTR1-like and EIN2-like polypeptide families from poplars. The expression of CTR1-like and EIN2-like genes such as Ptre-CTR1, Ptre-CTR3 and Ptre-EIN2a was studied in Populus tremula buds and leaves in response to dehydration, various light conditions and under senescence. In buds under dehydration, the maximal fold-change of the Ptre-CTR1, Ptre-CTR3 and Ptre-EIN2a expression level recorded almost identical values. This suggests that maintenance of a constant ratio between the transcript levels of genes encoding positive and negative ethylene signalling components is required under stress. The expression of the studied genes was 1.4-to 3-fold higher in response to darkness, but 4.5- to 51.2-fold and 21.6- to 51.2-fold higher under the early and moderate leaf senescence, respectively. It is worth noting that the senescence-related Ptre-EIN2a and Ptre-CTR3a expression profiles were very similar.Using in vitro assays, we demonstrated the ability of the catalytic domain of Ptre-CTR1 to phosphorylate the Ptre-EIN2a-like polypeptide, which is similar to that in Arabidopsis. The target substrate, the Ptre-CEND2a polypeptide (C-terminal part of Ptre-EIN2a), was only phosphorylated by the protein kinase Ptre-CTR1 and not by Ptre-CTR3. Moreover, the addition of Ptre-CTR3 polypeptides (-CTR3a or -CTR3b forms) to the reaction mixture had an inhibitory effect on Ptre-CTR1 auto- and trans-phosphorylation. In contrast to Ptre-CTR1, Ptre-CTR3 may act as a positive regulator in ethylene signalling in poplar; however, this hypothesis requires in vivo confirmation. Thus, the ethylene signalling route in poplar seems to be under the control of certain additional mechanisms which have not been reported in Arabidopsis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArabidopsis 3aPopulus tremula 3aactive sites 3abuds 3aethylene 3agenes 3ain vitro studies 3aleaves 3amessenger RNA 3apolypeptides 3aprotein-serine-threonine kinases 3aserine 3athreonine 0a1-Aminocyclopropane-1-Carboxylate oxidase 0aConstitutive triple response 1 0aEthylene 0aEthylene insensitive 2 0aPoplar 0aABA 0aACO 0aACS 0aCTR1 0aEDR1 0aEIN2 0aETR1 0aSAM1 aNowak, Witold1 aGałgański, Łukasz1 aBabula-Skowrońska, Danuta1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5641-52270 tPlant physiology and biochemistry.g2019 June, v. 139 p.660-671dElsevier Masson SASwJournal:jnl41590x0981-94287nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.plaphy.2019.04.0293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03332naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001300151245016700164300001400331520172900345592002802074650001502102650001602117650001102133650002302144650002402167650002002191650001702211650002402228650002202252650001802274650001902292650001302311650002402324650001202348653002402360653004202384653002602426653002502452653001502477700001702492700001302509700001702522700001802539700001502557700001602572700001702588700001602605773007502621856008502696852000902781655001202790IND60565444320221120032957.0170710e20170701xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056544432DNAL7 a10.1016/j.talanta.2017.03.0472doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLuo, Lan10aLabel-free and sensitive assay for deoxyribonuclease I activity based on enzymatically-polymerized superlong poly(thymine)-hosted fluorescent copper nanoparticles  ap. 57-63.  aDeoxyribonuclease I (DNase I) is an important physiological indicator and diagnostic biomarker, but traditional methods for assessing its activity are time-consuming, laborious, and usually radioactive. Herein, by effectively combining the special functions of DNase I and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT), a simple, green, cost-effective, label-free and ultrasensitive assay for DNase I activity has been constructed based on superlong poly(thymine)-hosted copper nanoparticles (poly T-CuNPs). In this strategy, a 3′-phosphorylated DNA primer is designed to block TdT polymerization. After addition of DNase I, the primer could be digested to release 3′-hydroxylated fragments, which could further be tailed by TdT in dTTP pool with superlong poly T ssDNA for CuNPs formation. Fluorescence measurements and gel electrophoresis demonstrated its feasibility for DNase I analysis. The results indicated that with a size of 3–4nm, the CuNPs templated by TdT-polymerized superlong poly T (>500 mer) had several advantages such as short synthetic time (<5min), large Stokes shift (~275nm) and intense red fluorescence emission. Under the optimal conditions, quantitative detection of DNase I was realized, showing a good linear correlation between 0.02 and 2.0U/mL (R2=0.9928) and a detection limit of 0.02U/mL. By selecting six other nucleases or proteins as controls, an excellent specificity was also verified. Then, the strategy was successfully applied to detect DNase I in diluted serum with a standard addition method, thus implying its reliability and practicability for biological samples. The proposed strategy might be promising as a sensing platform for related molecular biology and disease studies.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiomarkers 3ablood serum 3acopper 3acost effectiveness 3adeoxyribonuclease I 3adetection limit 3afluorescence 3agel electrophoresis 3amolecular biology 3ananoparticles 3apolymerization 3aproteins 3asingle-stranded DNA 3athymine 0aDeoxyribonuclease I 0aTerminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase 0aFluorescent detection 0aCopper nanoparticles 0aLabel-free1 aXu, Fengzhou1 aShi, Hui1 aHe, Xiaoxiao1 aQing, Taiping1 aLei, Yanli1 aTang, Jinlu1 aHe, Dinggeng1 aWang, Kemin0 tTalanta.g2017 July 01, v. 169 p.57-63dElsevier B.V.x0039-91407nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.talanta.2017.03.0473Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02848naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002000148245011100168300001600279500001900295520140800314592002801722596006601750650004401816650002201860650001501882650002301897650002001920650001301940650001301953650001401966650001501980650001401995650003102009650002202040650002502062700001902087700002002106700002102126700005702147773010702204856008202311852000902393655001202402IND60705936120221120135552.0200807e202009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070593612DNAL7 a10.1007/s11483-020-09633-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGhan, Sheah Yee10aInfluence of Soya Lecithin, Sorbitan and Glyceryl Monostearate on Physicochemical Properties of Organogels  ap. 386-395.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe objective of this study is to investigate the effects of three different organogelators, sorbitan monostearate (SMS), soya lecithin (SL) and glyceryl monostearate (GMS) prepared at different concentrations (12%, 15% and 18%, w/w) on the structural, thermal and mechanical properties of palm olein (PO)-based organogels. Polarized light microscopy analysis revealed needle-like crystals in SMS-PO, rod-shaped tubules in SL-PO and rosette-like aggregates in GMS-PO organogels. Intermolecular hydrogen bonding and van der Waals forces were the main drivers for the self-aggregation of these organogelators in PO, as observed in Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. X-ray diffraction (XRD) results indicated β’-type polymorphic structure in SL-PO and GMS-PO. As the concentration of organogelators increased, there was a corresponding increase in the firmness, gel-sol transition (Tgₛ) and melting temperatures of the organogels. SMS-PO with amorphous structure had the lowest firmness, thus produced weaker gel with lower thermal stability. The oil binding capacity (OBC) of both SL-PO and GMS-PO were over 90%, significantly higher than that of SMS-PO organogels. These findings indicate that crystallization is the key determinant factor to the final properties of the organogel networks. This is influenced by the molecular structure and the concentration of the organogelators used.  aPublisher supplied data  aFRGS/1/2015/WAB01/MUSM/03/1cMinistry of Education (Malaysia) 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aX-ray diffraction 3abiophysics 3achemical structure 3acrystallization 3afirmness 3ahydrogen 3alecithins 3aorganogels 3apalm oils 3apolarized light microscopy 3athermal stability 3avan der Waals forces1 aSiow, Lee Fong1 aTan, Chin-Ping,1 aCheong, Kok Whye1 aThoo, Yin Yin1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2581-11120 tFood biophysics.g2020 Sept., v. 15, no. 3 p.386-395dSpringer USwJournal:jnl3949866x1557-18587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11483-020-09633-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03143naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100005400139245009800193300001800291500002000309520143800329592002801767596007401795596007601869650003001945650001201975650002301987650001202010650001202022650001502034650002502049650002302074650002002097650001602117650001702133650000702150650002102157650003302178650002102211650001602232700001802248700001502266700002002281700001702301700001902318700002002337700002202357773015202379856007302531852000902604655001202613IND60612828020221118053358.0180908e201810  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061282802DNAL7 a10.1002/jctb.56592doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHaq, Ikram1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9453-995210aRemoval of phenolic compounds through overliming for enhanced saccharification of wheat straw  ap. 3011-3017.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aBACKGROUND: The deactivation of cellulases by phenolics is considered to be the main bottleneck in the saccharification of agricultural by‐products for efficient bioethanol production on a large scale. The removal of these phenolic inhibitors, produced as a result of pretreatment, is essential for an efficient saccharification process. One such process is overliming that has been mostly studied for hydrolysates of agricultural by‐products. In the present study however, solid biomass was used whereby the detection of phenolic compounds and their effect on saccharification was studied. RESULTS: The pretreated wheat straw showed 19% saccharification and total phenolic content (TPC) of 188 mg gallic acid equivalent g‐¹ biomass dry weight. Detoxification of pretreated wheat straw applying different alkalis, i.e. NaOH, NH₄OH and Ca(OH)₂ was conducted. Overliming using Ca(OH)₂ solution of pH 12, for 2 h at 80°C showed significant removal of 60% of phenolic compounds, which in turn enhanced the saccharification by 2.4‐fold. Scanning electron microscopy of pretreated and overlimed substrates also showed considerable change in structure, making it more accessible for enzymatic hydrolysis. CONCLUSION: The elimination of phenolic compounds due to overliming has facilitated increased saccharification that in turn will help in substrate efficient biofuel production. © 2018 Society of Chemical Industry  aPublisher supplied data  a27(54)/2007‐DSA (P&D)cMinistry of Science and Technology, Pakistan  cMinistry of Science and Technology (MoST), Islamic Republic of Pakistan 3aagroindustrial byproducts 3aalkalis 3aammonium hydroxide 3abiomass 3acalcium 3acellulases 3aenzymatic hydrolysis 3aethanol production 3afuel production 3agallic acid 3ahydrolysates 3apH 3asaccharification 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asodium hydroxide 3awheat straw1 aArshad, Yesra1 aNawaz, Ali1 aAftab, Muhammad1 aRehman, Asad1 aMukhtar, Hamid1 aMansoor, Zinnia1 aSyed, Qurratulain0 tJournal of chemical technology and biotechnology.g2018 Oct., v. 93, no. 10 p.3011-3017dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.wJournal:jnl39259x0268-25757nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jctb.56593Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02722naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245016300164300001600327520104200343592002801385650002501413650002501438650001701463650001801480650001301498650001501511650001301526650001901539650002001558650002101578650001601599650002701615650002001642650001801662650002101680650002201701650001401723650000901737650000901746650001301755650002501768650002001793700001901813700001901832700002401851700002101875700001901896700002001915700001901935773011201954856008102066852000902147655001202156IND60098108520221120032722.0141104e201209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009810852DNAL7 a10.1016/j.etp.2010.11.0172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTroudi, Afef10aNeurotoxicity and oxidative stress induced by gibberellic acid in rats during late pregnancy and early postnatal periods: Biochemical and histological changes  ap. 583-590.  aGibberellic acid (GA₃) is an endogenous plant growth regulator used worldwide in agriculture; however, little is known about its biochemical and physiological effects on mammals. This study investigated possible neurotoxic effects of GA₃ on the cerebrum and cerebellum of suckling rats. Female Wistar rats were given daily 200ppm GA₃ in drinking water from the 14th day of pregnancy until day 14 after delivery. Acetylcholinesterase activity in both cerebellum and cerebrum was inhibited after treatment with GA₃. Neurotoxicity was demonstrated by a significant increase in malondialdehyde level and a decrease in the antioxidant enzyme activities of catalase, superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase in the cerebrum and cerebellum of suckling pups. A significant decline of glutathione content and vitamin C was also observed. The biochemical parameters were correlated histologically with an abnormal development of the external granular layer and a loss of Purkinje cells in the cerebellum of GA₃-treated suckling rats.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabnormal development 3aacetylcholinesterase 3aantioxidants 3aascorbic acid 3acatalase 3acerebellum 3acerebrum 3adrinking water 3aenzyme activity 3agibberellic acid 3aglutathione 3aglutathione peroxidase 3amalondialdehyde 3aneurotoxicity 3aoxidative stress 3apostpartum period 3apregnancy 3apups 3arats 3asuckling 3asuperoxide dismutase 3avitamin content1 aBouaziz, Hanen1 aSoudani, Nejla1 aBen Amara, Ibtissem1 aBoudawara, Tahia1 aTouzani, Hanen1 aLyoussi, Badiaa1 aZeghal, Najiba0 tExperimental and toxicologic pathology.g2012 Sept., v. 64, no. 6 p.583-590dElsevier GmbHx0940-29937nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.etp.2010.11.0173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02167naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001700152245011200169300001600281520092400297592002801221650002101249650001501270650002401285650002301309650001601332650002201348650001701370650001101387650001301398653002401411653002201435653001301457653002101470700002301491700001901514700002201533773010601555856008701661852000901748655001201757IND60536578420221121133658.0190409e201504  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053657842DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biortech.2015.01.0802doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXiao, Yeyuan10aControlling a toxic shock of pentachlorophenol (PCP) to anaerobic digestion using activated carbon addition  ap. 303-311.  aSeveral powdered and granular activated carbons (PACs and GACs) were tested for adsorption of pentachlorophenol (PCP) in bench-scale anaerobic digestion reactors to control the toxicity of PCP to acetoclastic methanogenesis. Results showed that the adsorption capacities of PAC were reduced by 21–54%, depending on the PAC addition time, in the presence of the methanogenic sludge compared to the controls without sludge. As a preventive measure, PAC at a low dose of 20% (mass ratio to the VSS) added 24h prior to, or simultaneously with, the addition of PCP could completely eliminate the toxic effects of PCP. At the same dose, PAC also enabled methanogenesis to recover immediately after the sludge had been exposed to PCP for 24h. GAC was not effective in enabling the recovery of methanogenesis due to its slow adsorption kinetics; however, at a dose of 80% it could partially ameliorate the toxic shock of PCP.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactivated carbon 3aadsorption 3aanaerobic digestion 3amethane production 3amethanogens 3apentachlorophenol 3aseptic shock 3asludge 3atoxicity 0aAnaerobic digestion 0aPentachlorophenol 0aToxicity 0aActivated carbon1 aDe Araujo, Cecilia1 aSze, Chun Chau1 aStuckey, David C.0 tBioresource technology.g2015 Apr., v. 181 p.303-311dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46263x0960-85247nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2015.01.0803Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01427naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100006600145245008800211300002000299520040100319592002800720650001400748650002300762650002200785650003000807650001100837700006500848773013600913856007901049852000901128655001201137IND60677873320221120125020.0191213e20191030xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067787332DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.joc.9b023522doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBieliu̅nas, Vidmantas1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8436-452X10aIntroduction of Aryl Fluorosulfates into the Realm of Catellani Reaction Substrates  ap. 15706-15717.  aApplication of activated phenol fluorosulfates as substrates in a Pd/NBE mediated sequential alkylation-arylation, commonly known as a Catellani reaction, is presented.

Negative strand RNA viruses are known to carry nucleocapsid (N) protein, phospho (P) protein and RNA polymerase (L protein) packaged within the virion which possess all activities required for transcription, post-transcriptional modification of mRNA and replication. In order to understand the mechanism of transcription and replication of the virus, an in vitro transcription reconstitution system is required. In the present work, an in vitro transcription system has been developed with ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex purified from virus infected cells as well as partially purified recombinant polymerase (L-P) complex from insect cells along with N-RNA (genomic RNA encapsidated by N protein) template isolated from virus infected cells. RESULTS: RNP complex isolated from virus infected cells and recombinant L-P complex purified from insect cells was used to reconstitute transcription on N-RNA template. The requirement for this transcription reconstitution has been defined. Transcription of viral genes in the in vitro system was confirmed by PCR amplification of cDNAs corresponding to individual transcripts using gene specific primers. In order to measure the relative expression level of viral transcripts, real time PCR analysis was carried out. qPCR analysis of the transcription products made in vitro showed a gradient of polarity of transcription from 3’ end to 5’ end of the genome similar to that exhibited by the virus in infected cells. CONCLUSION: This report describes for the first time, the development of an in vitro transcription reconstitution system for PPRV with RNP complex purified from infected cells and recombinant L-P complex expressed in insect cells. Both the complexes were able to synthesize all the mRNA species in vitro, exhibiting a gradient of polarity in transcription.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA-directed RNA polymerase 3aSmall ruminant morbillivirus 3acomplementary DNA 3agenes 3ainsects 3amessenger RNA 3anucleocapsid 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3aribonucleoproteins 3atranscription (genetics) 3avirion 3aviruses1 aShaila, Melkote S0 tVirology journal.g2012 Dec., v. 9, no. 1 p.302-302dBioMed CentralwJournal:J000001738x1743-422X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1743-422X-9-3023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03875naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001600145245015200161300001800313520262500331592002802956650001502984650001902999650001603018650001203034650001503046650001903061650002003080650001503100650001103115650001503126650001203141650002503153650002203178650001303200700002103213700002203234773012103256856007903377852000903456655001203465IND60340750720221117225827.0150808e201508  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6034075072DNAL7 a10.1111/1365-2664.124432doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aUchida, Kei10aLand abandonment and intensification diminish spatial and temporal β‐diversity of grassland plants and herbivorous insects within paddy terraces  ap. 1033-1043.  aAlthough traditional land‐use and management practices are known to enhance environmental heterogeneity in agricultural lands, loss of heterogeneity resulting from recent land‐use changes can lead to spatiotemporal β‐diversity losses (biotic homogenization). However, patterns and causes of β‐diversity loss, especially at a within‐field scale, have remained unexplored. We examined β‐diversity declines in plants, butterflies and orthopterans resulting from land abandonment and intensification in semi‐natural grasslands on paddy margins at a within‐field scale in relation to changes in disturbance frequency and surrounding landscapes by surveying eight abandoned, thirteen traditional and ten intensive paddy terraces. Three indices, the additive partitioning of species richness (βₐdd) and the turnover (βₜᵤ) and nestedness (βₙₑ) components of Jaccard dissimilarity of plants and herbivores, were used to evaluate different aspects of β‐diversity. We hypothesized that biotic homogenization due to abandonment and intensification would be expressed as low spatiotemporal βₐdd and βₜᵤ, low spatial βₙₑ and high temporal βₙₑ. The spatial and temporal βₐdd of plants and herbivores were higher in traditional terraces than in others. Changes in mowing frequency caused direct declines in butterfly βₐdd and indirectly decreased herbivore βₐdd through diminished plant βₐdd in abandoned and intensified terraces. Neighbouring forests increased plant spatial and butterfly temporal βₐdd and βₜᵤ. Abandoned terraces had higher orthopteran spatial and plant temporal βₜᵤ than traditional terraces. Mowing frequency generally did not influence spatial and temporal βₜᵤ of plants and herbivores. In intensive terraces, temporal βₙₑ of plants were higher than in traditional terraces, suggesting dominance by plant species sharing similar phenologies. Synthesis and applications. These results suggest that traditional mowing practices are essential for maintaining plant and herbivore βₐdd, and consequently, species pools within terraces. The higher spatial or temporal species turnover of plants and orthopterans in abandoned terraces and higher temporal plant nestedness in intensive than in traditional terraces were not due to increases in species pools within terraces. Because within‐terrace environmental heterogeneity is thought to remain in abandoned and intensive terraces, we recommend reduction in mowing frequency in intensive terraces and reintroduction of mowing in abandoned terraces for biodiversity restoration.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOrthoptera 3aabandoned land 3abutterflies 3aforests 3agrasslands 3ahomogenization 3aland use change 3alandscapes 3amowing 3anestedness 3apaddies 3aphytophagous insects 3aspecies diversity 3aterraces1 aUshimaru, Atushi1 aDevictor, Vincent0 tJournal of applied ecology.g2015 Aug., v. 52, no. 4 p.1033-1043dBlackwell Scientific Publicationsx0021-89017nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1365-2664.124433Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03608naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002900148245013100177300001800308520205900326592002802385596005202413650001602465650002802481650001402509650001002523650001902533650001702552650001602569650001702585650003202602650001502634650002202649650001502671650002002686700003002706700002702736700002402763700003102787700002602818700002202844700002302866700002102889773012502910856008203035852000903117655001203126IND60750436920221121005622.0210915e202109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075043692DNAL7 a10.1007/s11033-021-06641-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSargazi, Marzieh Lotfian10aNaringenin attenuates cell viability and migration of C6 glioblastoma cell line: a possible role of hedgehog signaling pathway  ap. 6413-6421.  aOBJECTIVE: Gliomas are the most prevalent type of malignant primary brain tumors. Despite the availability of several treatment modalities, these tumors have poor prognostic features. Aberrant Hedgehog (Hh) signaling has been found to be implicated in the development of numerous malignancies including gliomas. Naringenin appears to have anti-proliferative and anti-cancer properties. However, there is no report describing its effects via the Hh signaling pathway on the C6 glioblastoma cell line. The current study was set to examine the anti-cancer effects of naringenin on C6 cells in order to determine the effect of this compound on the Hh signaling pathway. METHODS: The anti-proliferative and apoptotic effects of naringenin against C6 and 3T3 fibroblast cells were measured by 3‐(4,5‐dimethylthiazol‐2‐yl)‐2,5‐diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay and annexin-V/PI dual staining assay, respectively. The effect of naringenin on the migration of C6 cells was evaluated by the migration scratch assay. To assess the anti-cancer effect of naringenin on the Hh signaling pathway, the expression of Gli-1, Smo, and Sufu at protein levels in C6 cells was analyzed using western blotting. RESULTS: The obtained data indicated that naringenin exerted higher cytotoxicity against C6 cells (IC50 value of 114 ± 3.4 µg/mL) than normal 3T3 fibroblasts (IC50 value of 290 ± 7 µg/mL). Naringenin (114 µg/mL) also induced stronger apoptotic effects on C6 cells than 3T3 cells after 24 h of incubation. Furthermore, naringenin at a concentration of 114 µg/mL and a lower concentration of 60 µg/mL inhibited the migration of the C6 cell line. In addition, naringenin at a concentration of 114 µg/mL significantly decreased the expression of Gli-1 and Smo and elevated the expression of Sufu at the protein level in the C6 cell line. CONCLUSION: These data represent that naringenin may have a potential effect on the management of the proliferation and metastasis of malignant gliomas by inhibiting the Hh signaling pathway.  aPublisher supplied data  a99000413cKerman University of Medical Sciences 3aErinaceidae 3aantineoplastic activity 3aapoptosis 3abrain 3acell viability 3acytotoxicity 3afibroblasts 3aglioblastoma 3ainhibitory concentration 50 3ametastasis 3amolecular biology 3anaringenin 3aprotein content1 aJuybari, Kobra Bahrampour1 aTarzi, Mojdeh Esmaeili1 aAmirkhosravi, Arian1 aNematollahi, Mohammad Hadi1 aMirzamohammdi, Solmaz1 aMehrbani, Mehrzad1 aMehrabani, Mehrnaz1 aMehrabani, Mitra0 tMolecular biology reports.g2021 Sept., v. 48, no. 9 p.6413-6421dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl5510x0301-48517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11033-021-06641-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02387naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001800152245005700170300001600227520095100243592002801194650002401222650001401246650001901260650001101279650002101290650001301311650001001324650002401334650001201358650001101370650002501381651001401406653001401420653001701434653002101451653000901472653003101481700001301512700001401525700001901539700001301558700002101571700001901592700001301611700001501624700001601639773010601655856008701761852000901848655001201857IND60536578520221120052846.0190409e201506  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053657852DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biortech.2015.01.0812doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBi, Chong-hao10aProcess development for scum to biodiesel conversion  ap. 185-193.  aA novel process was developed for converting scum, a waste material from wastewater treatment facilities, to biodiesel. Scum is an oily waste that was skimmed from the surface of primary and secondary settling tanks in wastewater treatment plants. Currently scum is treated either by anaerobic digestion or landfilling which raised several environmental issues. The newly developed process used a six-step method to convert scum to biodiesel, a higher value product. A combination of acid washing and acid catalyzed esterification was developed to remove soap and impurities while converting free fatty acids to methyl esters. A glycerol washing was used to facilitate the separation of biodiesel and glycerin after base catalyzed transesterification. As a result, 70% of dried and filtered scum was converted to biodiesel which is equivalent to about 134,000 gallon biodiesel per year for the Saint Paul waste water treatment plant in Minnesota.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanaerobic digestion 3abiodiesel 3aesterification 3aesters 3afree fatty acids 3aglycerol 3atanks 3atransesterification 3awashing 3awastes 3awastewater treatment 3aMinnesota 0aBiodiesel 0aAcid washing 0aGlycerol washing 0aScum 0aWastewater treatment plant1 aMin, Min1 aNie, Yong1 aXie, Qing-long1 aLu, Qian1 aDeng, Xiang-yuan1 aAnderson, Erik1 aLi, Dong1 aChen, Paul1 aRuan, Roger0 tBioresource technology.g2015 June, v. 185 p.185-193dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46263x0960-85247nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2015.01.0813Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01679naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245010100167300001600268520076800284592002801052650001201080650001801092650002201110650001501132650003401147700001801181773010001199856008101299852000901380655001201389IND60573244520221123030232.0170721e201612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057324452DNAL7 a10.1007/s11842-016-9334-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHarrison, Steve10aFinancial Evaluation of Forestry Investments: Common Pitfalls and Guidelines for Better Analyses  ap. 463-479.  aMany of the papers submitted to Small-scale Forestry contain financial analyses of forestry investments.

POWV neuroinvasive disease was added to the U.S. nationally notifiable disease list in 2001 and nonneuroinvasive disease was added in 2004. The only previous review of the epidemiology of POWV disease in the United States based on cases reported to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) covered the period from 1999 through 2005. Methods: We describe the epidemiology and clinical features of laboratory-confirmed POWV disease cases reported to CDC from 2006 through 2016. Results: There were 99 cases of POWV disease reported during the 11-year period, including 89 neuroinvasive and 10 nonneuroinvasive disease cases. There was a median of seven cases per year (range: 1–22), with the highest numbers of cases reported in 2011 (n = 16), 2013 (n = 15), and 2016 (n = 22). Cases occurred throughout the year, but peaked in May and June. Cases were reported primarily from northeastern and north-central states. Overall, 72 (73%) cases were in males and the median age was 62 years (range: 3 months–87 years). Of the 11 (11%) cases who died, all were aged >50 years. The average annual incidence of neuroinvasive POWV disease was 0.0025 cases per 100,000 persons. Conclusions: POWV disease can be a severe disease and has been diagnosed with increased frequency in recent years. However, this might reflect increased disease awareness, improved test availability, and enhanced surveillance efforts. Clinicians should consider POWV disease in patients presenting with acute encephalitis or aseptic meningitis who are resident in, or have traveled to, an appropriate geographic region.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aCenters for Disease Control and Prevention 3aPowassan virus 3adisease severity 3aencephalitis 3ahumans 3amales 3ameningitis 3amonitoring 3anotifiable disease 3apatients 3apeople 3aUnited States 0aPowassan 0aarboviral disease1 aLindsey, Nicole P.1 aFischer, Marc1 aHills, Susan L.0 tVector borne and zoonotic diseases.g2018 June 01, v. 18, no. 6 p.286-290dMary Ann Liebert, Inc.wJournal:J000000160x1557-77597nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1089/vbz.2017.22393Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02295naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001800152245009000170300001600260520106500276592002801341650001701369650001201386650001701398650001801415650001601433650001801449650000701467650001901474650001701493650001701510650002501527653002701552653002101579653001601600653002101616653001801637700001601655773010601671856008701777852000901864655001201873IND60536578620221121133632.0190409e201504  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053657862DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biortech.2015.01.0822doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiang, Shaobo10aCarboxylic acid production from brewer’s spent grain via mixed culture fermentation  ap. 179-183.  aThis study aimed at investigating carboxylic acid production from brewer’s spent grain (BSG) via mixed culture fermentation. The results showed that the distribution of fermentation products was significantly affected by pH conditions and the addition of electron donors. Lactic acid was the dominant component under acidic and alkaline conditions while volatile fatty acids (VFAs) became dominant under the neutral condition. Furthermore, the neutral condition favored the chain elongation of carboxylic acids, especially with ethanol as the electron donor. Ethanol addition enhanced valeric acid and caproic acid production by 44% and 167%, respectively. Lactic acid addition also had positive effects on VFAs production under the neutral condition but limited to C2–C4 products. As a result, propionic acid and butyric acid production was increased by 109% and 152%, respectively. These findings provide substantial evidence for regulating carboxylic acid production during mixed culture fermentation of BSG by controlling pH and adding electron donors.  aPublisher supplied data 3abutyric acid 3aethanol 3afermentation 3ahexanoic acid 3alactic acid 3amixed culture 3apH 3apropionic acid 3aspent grains 3avaleric acid 3avolatile fatty acids 0aBrewer’s spent grain 0aChain elongation 0aLactic acid 0aCarboxylic acids 0aMixed culture1 aWan, Caixia0 tBioresource technology.g2015 Apr., v. 182 p.179-183dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46263x0960-85247nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2015.01.0823Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02833naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100007000151245010500221506010400326506007600430520116700506592002801673506003701701650002301738650001701761650002501778650001101803650001301814650002401827650002501851651001101876651001001887653001301897653001601910653001001926653002601936653000901962653002201971653001601993700002302009700001802032700003002050700001802080700002302098700001802121773009302139856008602232852000902318655001202327IND60779189520221207095415.0220906e202206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077918952DNAL7 a10.1016/j.heliyon.2022.e095782doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLarabi-Marie-Sainte, Souad1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4888-900010aForecasting COVID19 parameters using time-series: KSA, USA, Spain, and Brazil comparative case study  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aMany countries are suffering from the COVID19 pandemic. The number of confirmed cases, recovered, and deaths are of concern to the countries having a high number of infected patients. Forecasting these parameters is a crucial way to control the spread of the disease and struggle with the pandemic. This study aimed at forecasting the number of cases and deaths in KSA using time-series and well-known statistical forecasting techniques including Exponential Smoothing and Linear Regression. The study is extended to forecast the number of cases in the main countries such that the US, Spain, and Brazil (having a large number of contamination) to validate the proposed models (Drift, SES, Holt, and ETS). The forecast results were validated using four evaluation measures. The results showed that the proposed ETS (resp. Drift) model is efficient to forecast the number of cases (resp. deaths). The comparison study, using the number of cases in KSA, showed that ETS (with RMSE reaching 18.44) outperforms the state-of-the art studies (with RMSE equal to 107.54). The proposed forecasting model can be used as a benchmark to tackle this pandemic in any country.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aCOVID-19 infection 3acase studies 3adisease transmission 3amodels 3apandemic 3aregression analysis 3atime series analysis 3aBrazil 3aSpain 0aCOVID-19 0aForecasting 0aDrift 0aExponential smoothing 0aHolt 0aLinear regression 0aTime-series1 aAlhalawani, Sawsan1 aShaheen, Sara1 aAlmustafa, Khaled Mohamad1 aSaba, Tanzila1 aKhan, Fatima Nayer1 aRehman, Amjad0 tHeliyon.g2022 June, v. 8, no. 6 p.e09578-dElsevier LtdwJournal:23264x2405-84407nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2022.e095783Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02379naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001900148245009700167300001600264500001900280520104000299592002801339596006301367650001501430650001901445650002401464650001101488650001801499650001001517650001101527650001101538650002001549650001201569650001101581650001601592700001801608700003201626700002301658700006601681773010701747856008201854852000901936655001201945IND60705936420221120150038.0200807e202009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070593642DNAL7 a10.1007/s11483-020-09627-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlba, Katerina10aEffects of Blackcurrant Fibre on Dough Physical Properties and Bread Quality Characteristics  ap. 313-322.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aWheat flour was partially replaced with blackcurrant pomace, soluble, and insoluble dietary fibre in dough and bread formulations. The impact of blackcurrant fibre on physical properties of doughs and breads was probed using a set of complementary physicochemical techniques. The effect of fibre on aromatic profile of substituted breads was performed using analysis of volatile compounds. Analysis of fibre-substituted doughs and breads revealed that supplementation with pomace or insoluble fibre at concentrations >5% w/w or with pectin at concentrations >0.5% w/w alters their overall physicochemical responses. Pomace and pectin primarily acted as water-binders and decreased the extent of gluten hydration but insoluble fibre did not bind water to the same extent suggesting higher interaction capacity between its cellulosic components and gluten proteins resulting in formation of stiffer doughs. More than one hundred volatiles were determined with alcohols, furan derivatives and aldehydes being the major aromatic compounds.  aPublisher supplied data  aFO0319cDepartment for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs 3abiophysics 3ablack currants 3abreadmaking quality 3abreads 3adietary fiber 3adough 3afurans 3agluten 3ainsoluble fiber 3apectins 3apomace 3awheat flour1 aRizou, Theano1 aParaskevopoulou, Adamantini1 aCampbell, Grant M.1 aKontogiorgos, Vassilis1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6016-75800 tFood biophysics.g2020 Sept., v. 15, no. 3 p.313-322dSpringer USwJournal:jnl3949866x1557-18587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11483-020-09627-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03258naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245011400169300001600283520156300299592002801862650001301890650001501903650001601918650001501934650001601949650001501965650000901980650002001989650002202009650001302031650001702044650001202061650002102073650002002094650001702114650001702131650002102148650001002169650000902179650001602188651001302204651001702217700002602234700001702260700002202277700002602299700002602325700001602351700002102367700001702388700002002405700002802425773011302453856008102566852000902647655001202656IND60098108820221120032727.0141104e201211  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009810882DNAL7 a10.1016/j.etp.2011.01.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStoev, Stoycho D.10aExperimental mycotoxic nephropathy in pigs provoked by a mouldy diet containing ochratoxin A and fumonisin B1  ap. 733-741.  aMycotoxic nephropathy was induced in eighteen young pigs by mouldy diets containing 0.5ppm ochratoxin A (OTA) and/or 10ppm fumonisin B1 (FB1) for three months. While the most obvious damages provoked by OTA were seen in the kidneys as expressed by the strong degenerative changes in proximal tubules and fibrosis in kidneys, FB1 was found to induce an increase in permeability of vessels mainly in lung, brain, cerebellum or kidneys and slight to moderate degenerative changes in kidneys. Pathomorphological damages in pigs exposed to both mycotoxins simultaneously present a combination of the main lesions provoked by each mycotoxin alone being stronger in their expression. Biochemical investigations as expressed by the increase of serum creatinine, urea and enzyme activity of ASAT/ALAT and by the decrease of serum cholesterol, total protein, albumin and glucose were strongest in pigs exposed to both mycotoxins simultaneously as can be anticipated form the strongest lesions in the kidneys. Both mycotoxins and their combination were found to disturb powerfully humoral immune response in all experimental pigs as expressed by the strong decrease in antibody titer against Morbus Aujesky at days 21 and 35 after vaccination. Having in mind that the feed levels of the both mycotoxins as well as the exposure time and the pathological findings corresponded to those in some spontaneous cases of porcine nephropathy in Bulgaria and South Africa, it can be concluded that the same mycotoxins are involved in the observed field cases of that nephropathy.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalbumins 3aantibodies 3ablood serum 3acerebellum 3acholesterol 3acreatinine 3adiet 3aenzyme activity 3aexposure duration 3afibrosis 3afumonisin B1 3aglucose 3ahumoral immunity 3akidney diseases 3aochratoxin A 3apermeability 3aproximal tubules 3aswine 3aurea 3avaccination 3aBulgaria 3aSouth Africa1 aGundasheva, Dimitrina1 aZarkov, Ivan1 aMircheva, Teodora1 aZapryanova, Dimitrina1 aDenev, St.q(Stefan),1 aMitev, Yuri1 aDaskalov, Hristo1 aDutton, Mike1 aMwanza, Mulunda1 aSchneider, Yves-Jacques0 tExperimental and toxicologic pathology.g2012 Nov., v. 64, no. 7-8 p.733-741dElsevier GmbHx0940-29937nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.etp.2011.01.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01877naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002100152245013800173300001600311520062700327592002800954650002600982650001401008650002101022650001101043650001801054650000901072650002501081650001601106653001401122653002001136653002301156653002501179653001701204700005701221700001701278773008901295856008601384852000901470655001201479IND60547293320221122044441.0160903e201502  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054729332DNAL7 a10.1016/j.atmosenv.2014.12.0302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIchige, Hiroyuki10aStochastic model for the fluctuations of the atmospheric concentration of radionuclides and its application to uncertainty evaluation  ap. 156-162.  aWe propose a new model of the atmospheric concentration of a radionuclide with the inclusion of fluctuations of the concentration.

The advantage of the model is that the uncertainty in radiation exposure risk, with regard to the concentration fluctuations, can be quantitatively estimated. We show the range of fluctuations of ±σ, ±2σ, ±3σ in the 10-year measurement of the atmospheric concentration in Chernobyl and confirmed the validity of the model.  aPublisher supplied data 3aatmospheric chemistry 3aequations 3amodel validation 3amodels 3aradionuclides 3arisk 3astochastic processes 3auncertainty 0aChernobyl 0aRisk assessment 0aStochastic process 0aTime-series analysis 0aRadionuclide1 aFukuchi, Shun1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2505-22641 aHatano, Yuko0 tAtmospheric environment.g2015 Feb., v. 103 p.156-162dElsevier Ltdx1352-23107nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.atmosenv.2014.12.0303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02815naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001500144245013600159300002000295520149700315592002801812650001701840650001601857650001601873650001401889650001201903650001301915650001301928650001601941653002901957653002401986653002102010653002102031653001102052700001302063700001702076700001502093700005602108773014202164856007802306852000902384655001202393IND60620667320221118003559.0181114e20181023xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062066732DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.8b136012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHu, Yupeng10aField-Effect Charge Transport in Doped Polymer Semiconductor–Insulator Alternating Bulk Junctions with Ultrathin Transport Layers  ap. 39091-39099.  aConjugated-polymer field-effect transistors are attractive for flexible electronics. However, relatively high chemical doping (oxidation) concentration of p-type polymer semiconductors is usually not compatible with good transistor performance, due to poor switching-off capability and short-channel performance. Here, we propose a combined simulation and experimental investigation on charge transport in a semiconductor–insulator alternating bulk junction composed of repeating semiconductor and insulator regions, which shows better transistor performance at higher doping levels, as compared with traditional planar transistors. Moreover, the doped semiconductor transport layers in the junction should be less than 2 nm thick to ensure sufficient pinch-off capability. Using some semiconductors including poly(3-hexylthiophene), we utilize a fast solvent evaporation approach to obtain semiconductor–insulator alternating bulk junctions with ultrathin (thickness < 2 nm) semiconductor crystallites and with vertical gradients of both morphology and electronic properties. Doping with a concentration of up to 10¹⁹ cm–³ simultaneously induces the improvement of field-effect mobility, on/off ratio, and subthreshold swing, which leads to long-term (>1 year) stability, without lowering the short-channel performance. Moreover, these heterojunctions are optically transparent, nearly colorless, and flexible, thus could be exploited for wide electronic and photonic applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3acrystallites 3aelectronics 3aevaporation 3aoxidation 3aphotons 3apolymers 3asolvents 3atransistors 0afield-effect transistors 0aconjugated-polymers 0aultrathin layers 0acharge transport 0adoping1 aBu, Laju1 aWang, Xudong1 aZhou, Ling1 aLu, Guanghao1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7829-73080 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2018 Oct. 23, v. 10, no. 45 p.39091-39099dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.8b136013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02803naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100003000148245011500178300001200293520148400305592002801789650000801817650001001825650001901835650002301854650002001877650001201897650001101909650001901920650002001939650001901959650002701978650002002005650001502025650001002040700001902050700002502069700002202094700002002116773014102136856008302277852000902360655001202369IND60784319720221118072755.0220826e202208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078431972DNAL7 a10.1007/s11270-022-05777-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAltınay, Ayşegül Derya10aMembrane Concentrate Management Model of Biologically Pre-treated Textile Wastewater for Zero-Liquid Discharge  ap. 303.  aMembrane technology is an outstanding alternative for treating complex textile wastewaters. However, difficulties in the management of the resultant concentrate are the main disadvantage of these membrane technologies. This study is focused on the development of integrative management for membrane concentrate of textile effluent under the principle of discharge regulations that aim to achieve zero-liquid discharge (ZLD). Thus, biologically treated textile wastewater (BTTW) is fed to nanofiltration (NF) and reverse osmosis (RO) membranes with ultrafiltration (UF) pre-treatment, separately. NF concentrates (NFC) and RO concentrates (ROC) are further treated with electrocoagulation (EC) and electro-Fenton (EF) to remove COD and color. After the EC and EF steps, the electrodialysis (ED) method is used for ion removal. Operational costs of each process are calculated. Through the NF of BTTW > 65% COD and 92% color removals were achieved, whereas with the RO process, > 65% COD and 98% color removals were obtained. For NFC, > 80% COD and 91% color removal efficiencies were achieved with EC + ED processes and 57% COD and almost total color removal was achieved with EF + ED processes. For ROC, 71% COD and 85% color removals were obtained with EC + ED processes and 85% COD and 98% color removal was observed with EF + ED processes. Additionally, efficient treatment and concentrate management options were investigated for textile effluent.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3acolor 3adecolorization 3aelectrocoagulation 3aelectrodialysis 3afabrics 3amodels 3ananofiltration 3areverse osmosis 3asoil pollution 3atextile mill effluents 3aultrafiltration 3awastewater 3awater1 aYazagan, Alper1 aKoseoglu-Imer, D.

Evidence of MCPyV existence in other forms of malignancy such as cutaneous squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs) is growing. Cervical cancers became the focus of our interest in searching for potentially MCPyV-related tumors because: (i) the major histological type of cervical cancer is the SCC; (ii) the uterine cervix is a common site of neuroendocrine carcinomas histologically similar to MCCs; and (iii) MCPyV might be transmitted during sexual interaction as demonstrated for human papillomavirus (HPV). In this study, we aimed to clarify the possible presence of MCPyV in cervical SCCs from Japanese patients. Cervical adenocarcinomas (ACs) were also studied. RESULTS: Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue samples from 48 cervical SCCs and 16 cervical ACs were examined for the presence of the MCPyV genome by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and sequencing analyses. PCR analysis revealed that 9/48 cervical SCCs (19%) and 4/16 cervical ACs (25%) were positive for MCPyV DNA. MCPyV-specific PCR products were sequenced to compare them with reference sequences. The nucleotide sequences in the MCPyV large T (LT)-sequenced region were the same among MCPyV-positive cervical SCCs and AC. Conversely, in the MCPyV viral protein 1 (VP1)-sequenced region, two cervical SCCs and three cervical ACs showed several nucleotide substitutions, of which three caused amino acid substitutions. These sequencing results suggested that three MCPyV variants of the VP1 were identified in our cases. Immunohistochemistry showed that the LT antigen was expressed in tumor cells in MCPyV-positive samples. Genotyping of human HPV in the MCPyV-positive samples revealed that infected HPVs were HPV types 16, 31 and 58 for SCCs and HPV types 16 and 18 for ACs. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides the first observation that MCPyV coexists in a subset of HPV-associated cervical cancers from Japanese patients. The prevalence of MCPyV in these lesions was close to that observed in the cutaneous SCCs. Further worldwide epidemiological surveys are warranted to determine the possible association of MCPyV with pathogenesis of cervical cancers.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aHuman polyomavirus 5 3aadenocarcinoma 3aamino acid substitution 3aanimal viruses 3aantigens 3acervix 3aepidemiological studies 3agenome 3agenotyping 3aimmunohistochemistry 3aneoplasm cells 3anucleotide sequences 3apathogenesis 3apatients 3apolymerase chain reaction 3asequence analysis 3askin (animal) 3auterine cervical neoplasms1 aHashida, Yumiko1 aNemoto, Yuiko1 aOguri, Hiroyoshi1 aMaeda, Nagamasa1 aFurihata, Mutsuo1 aFukaya, Takao1 aDaibata, Masanori0 tVirology journal.g2012 Dec., v. 9, no. 1 p.154-154dBioMed CentralwJournal:J000001738x1743-422X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1743-422X-9-1543Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01608naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245005100168300001600219520033700235592002800572650002100600650001700621650001300638650001700651650001500668650004600683650001300729650004400742653001300786653001400799653001200813653000800825700002200833700002300855700002300878700002900901773017700930856008201107852000901189655001201198IND60632950120221118221654.0190326e201805  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063295012DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bjp.2018.03.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBelaabed, Soumia12aA new glucosidic iridoid from Isodon rubescens  ap. 294-297.  aOne new glucosidic iridoid, 6-O-veratroylbarlerin, was isolated from the chloroform/methanol extract of Isodon rubescens (Hemsl.)

Currently, quality loss during storage and transport of plantlets and cuttings is a limiting factor for spreading the workload, broadening the export range, and the use of slower but more environmentally friendly transport. In the agro-food sector, equilibrium modified atmosphere packaging has enhanced the shelf-life of minimally processed produce. The required properties for an equilibrium modified atmosphere packaging system can be estimated from the respiration rate of the packaged commodity under specified atmospheric composition and storage temperature. In this work, a model structure is validated to estimate the respiration rate as a function of oxygen concentration and temperature for Phalaenopsis and Chrysanthemum. The oxygen concentration as a function of time was monitored in a closed system for different storage temperatures. The models show a good fit to the data. The model coefficients were dependent on the plant species and characteristics. The resulting formulae can be used to estimate the oxygen consumption rate of the produce under a range of oxygen concentrations and a temperature range from 15 °C to 32 °C for Phalaenopsis and from 2 °C to 14 °C for Chrysanthemum. The oxygen concentrations for which the formulae are valid depend on the storage temperature and plant species. The models can be used to estimate a dynamic oxygen consumption rate profile during storage and transport.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChrysanthemum 3aPhalaenopsis 3aagronomy 3aatmospheric chemistry 3acell respiration 3aeconomic valuation 3aexports 3aornamental plants 3aoxygen 3aoxygen consumption 3aplantlets 3ashelf life 3astorage temperature1 aChristiaens, Annelies 1 aVermeulen, An 1 aVan Labeke, Marie-Christine 1 aDevlieghere, F.q(Frank),1 aRagaert, Peter 0 tAgronomy.g2021 Jan. 28, v. 11, no. 2dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:12361x2073-43957nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agronomy110202373Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02946naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100005700144245011700201300002000318520154100338592002801879650001201907650001301919650001501932650001301947650002701960650001601987650001202003650000902015650001402024650001102038650001302049650001402062650001302076653001302089653001202102653001502114653002302129653002702152700001902179700005902198773014302257856007902400852000902479655001202488IND60795671120221119231029.0221005e20220912xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079567112DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.2c123802doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFukada, Kenta1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7840-441710aThermally Degradable Inductors with Water-Resistant Metal Leaf/Oleogel Wires and Gelatin/Chitosan Hydrogel Films  ap. 44697-44703.  aIngestible electronics monitor biometric information from outside the body. Making them with harmless or digestible materials will contribute to further reducing the burden on the patient’s oral intake. Here, considering that the inductive part plays an important role in communications, we demonstrate a degradable inductor fabricated with harmless substances. Such a transient component must meet conflicting requirements for both operation and disassembly. Therefore, we integrated a substrate made of gelatin, a thermally degradable material, and a precision coil pattern made of edible gold or silver leaf. However, gelatin itself lost its initial shape easily due to quick sol–gel changes in physiological conditions. Thus, we managed the gelatin’s thermal responsiveness by using a tangle of gelatin/chitosan gel networks and genipin, an organic cross-linking agent, and gained insights into the criteria for developing transient devices with thermo-degradability. In addition, to compensate for the lack of water resistance and low conductivity of thin metal foils, we propose a laminated structure with oleogel (beeswax/olive oil). LCR resonance circuits, by connecting a commercial capacitor to the coil, worked wirelessly in the megahertz band and gradually degraded in a warm-water environment. The presented organic electronics will contribute to the future development of transient wireless communications for implantable and ingestible medical devices or environmental sensors with natural and harmless ingredients.  aPublisher supplied data 3abeeswax 3abiometry 3acapacitors 3achitosan 3across-linking reagents 3aelectronics 3agelatin 3agold 3ahydrogels 3aleaves 3aoleogels 3aolive oil 3apatients 0ahydrogel 0aoleogel 0ametal leaf 0adegradable antenna 0aingestible electronics1 aTajima, Takuro1 aSeyama, Michiko1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4526-33600 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2022 Sept. 12, v. 14, no. 39 p.44697-44703dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.2c123803Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01716naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002300145245008600168300002000254520056300274592002800837650001300865650002300878650002500901650002200926650001600948650001800964650003000982700001701012700005901029700006601088773013601154856007901290852000901369655001201378IND60677873720221123040102.0191213e20191024xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067787372DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.joc.9b023912doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCunha, Vitor L.

This review summarizes research on the PAs found in macroalgae, their transport and metabolism, and their biological significance in processes such as cell division, chloroplast development, and reproduction. The involvement of PAs in environmental stress responses in macroalgae is also addressed. The discussion of PAs in this review not only demonstrates that PAs play an important role in physiological processes in macroalgae, but also clearly demonstrates the similarities and differences between PA metabolism in macroalgae and higher plants.

Current high-throughput chromosome conformation capture (Hi-C) technologies have identified large-scale chromatin structural motifs, such as topologically associating domains and looping. However, structural rules at the smallest or nucleosome scale remain poorly understood. Here, we coupled nucleosome-resolved Hi-C technology with simulated annealing-molecular dynamics (SA-MD) simulation to reveal 3D spatial distributions of nucleosomes and their genome-wide orientation in chromatin. Our method, called Hi-CO, revealed distinct nucleosome folding motifs across the yeast genome. Our results uncovered two types of basic secondary structural motifs in nucleosome folding: α-tetrahedron and β-rhombus analogous to α helix and β sheet motifs in protein folding. Using mutants and cell-cycle-synchronized cells, we further uncovered motifs with specific nucleosome positioning and orientation coupled to epigenetic features at individual loci. By illuminating molecular-level structure-function relationships in eukaryotic chromatin, our findings establish organizational principles of nucleosome folding.  aPublisher supplied data 3aepigenetics 3agenome 3aloci 3amutants 3anucleosomes 3aprotein folding 3astructure-activity relationships 3ayeasts1 aAndō, Tadashi,1 aPriest, David G.1 aKumar, Vipin1 aYoshida, Yamato1 aTaniguchi, Yuichi1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5677-89010 tCell.g2019 Jan. 24, v. 176, no. 3 p.520-534.e25dElsevier Inc.wJournal:11769x0092-86747nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2018.12.0143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03640naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100005500139245013100194300001800325500002000343520189200363592002802255596005002283596002202333650002502355650002202380650002002402650001802422650002502440650002502465650001502490650001202505650001502517650001402532650001902546650001902565650002202584650001202606650001502618650003502633650001902668650001702687650001902704650002502723700002402748700002202772700002302794700002302817700001302840773015102853856007303004852000903077655001203086IND60612828520221118053411.0180908e201810  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061282852DNAL7 a10.1002/jctb.56422doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEroglu, Ela1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6080-287910aApplication of poly(2‐hydroxyethyl methacrylate) hydrogel disks for the immobilization of three different microalgal species  ap. 2887-2897.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aBACKGROUND: Algal growth on solid surfaces confers the advantage of combining the algal harvesting and bioprocessing steps at a single stage, in addition to the easier handling of the immobilized cells that occupy a reduced amount of space. The current work employed the application of macroporous poly(2‐hydroxyethyl methacrylate) (PHEMA) hydrogel disks as a water‐insoluble, non‐toxic and recyclable immobilization matrix for different microalgal strains (Nannochloropsis sp., Dunaliella salina, and Botryococcus braunii) that offer value‐added products for various commercial applications. RESULTS: The study demonstrated the effect of variations in the surface characteristics of the algal strains and hydrogel surfaces on the immobilization efficiencies. Gelatin was further used to modify PHEMA hydrogels to achieve higher bioaffinity and surface hydrophilicity. The results showed that highly salt‐tolerant microalgal cells (Dunaliella salina, Nannochloropsis sp.) had significantly higher tendencies to attach on the gelatin‐modified PHEMA hydrogel compared with the freshwater B. braunii colonies; embedded within an extracellular matrix mainly made of hydrophobic components, which displayed better attachment to the unmodified PHEMA hydrogels. CONCLUSION: The proposed PHEMA hydrogels are easily‐manufactured and highly durable materials with the hydrogel disks still retaining their integrity after several years when in contact with a liquid. PHEMA disks also have the benefits of having adjustable porosities by changing the composition of the polymerization mixture, and modifiable surface properties by simply binding various synthetic or natural molecules on their surfaces, which can bring several new opportunities for harvesting various microalgal cells with different surface morphologies and chemical compositions. © 2018 Society of Chemical Industry  aPublisher supplied data  cUniversity, State and Commonwealth Government  cCurtin University 3aBotryococcus braunii 3aDunaliella salina 3aNannochloropsis 3abioprocessing 3achemical composition 3aextracellular matrix 3afreshwater 3agelatin 3aharvesting 3ahydrogels 3ahydrophilicity 3ahydrophobicity 3aimmobilized cells 3aliquids 3amicroalgae 3apolyhydroxyethyl methacrylates 3apolymerization 3aporous media 3asalt tolerance 3avalue-added products1 aWijihastuti, Risa S1 aGrenik, Elizabeth1 aVadiveloo, Ashiwin1 aMoheimani, Navid R1 aLou, Xia0 tJournal of chemical technology and biotechnology.g2018 Oct., v. 93, no. 10 p.2887-2897dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl39259x0268-25757nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jctb.56423Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03425naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002100145245012100166300001200287520176100299592002802060650001402088650001402102650002002116650001102136650001602147650002202163650002202185650003502207650001102242650002302253650002002276650001502296650001302311650001902324650002502343650002802368650001402396650001202410650001502422651001102437700002202448700002602470700002802496700002402524700002202548700002202570700002102592700002302613700002602636773010902662856007902771852000902850655001202859IND60709049220221120231653.0200902e201212  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070904922DNAL7 a10.1186/1743-422X-9-2662doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aValiakos, George10aSerological and molecular investigation into the role of wild birds in the epidemiology of West Nile virus in Greece  ap. 266.  aBACKGROUND: A West Nile virus (WNV) disease outbreak occurred in 2010 in northern Greece with a total of 262 laboratory-confirmed human cases and 35 deaths. A serological and molecular surveillance was conducted on samples of hunter-harvested wild birds prior to and during the outbreak. FINDINGS: Serum and tissue samples from 295 resident and migratory wild birds, hunter-harvested during the 2009–2010 and 2010–2011 hunting seasons at the epicenter of the outbreak in northern Greece, were tested for the presence of WNV-specific antibodies by immunofluorescence assay and virus neutralization test. WNV neutralizing antibodies were detected in 53 avian samples. Fourteen positive sera were obtained from birds hunter-harvested up to 8 months prior to the human outbreak. Specific genetic determinants of virulence (His249Pro NS3 mutation, E-glycosylation motif) were recognized in a WNV lineage 2 strain isolated from a hunter-harvested Eurasian magpie and a nucleotide mismatch was revealed between this strain and a mosquito WNV strain isolated one month earlier in the same area. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first report regarding exposure of wild birds to WNV prior to the 2010 outbreak, in Greece. Results provide evidence of the implication of wild birds in a local enzootic cycle that could allow maintenance and amplification of the virus before and during the outbreak. Findings of past exposure of migratory birds to WNV upon their arrival in Greece during autumn migration, suggest avian species with similar migration traits as candidates for the introduction of WNV into Greece. The possibility that an endemic circulation of WNV could have caused the outbreak, after an amplification cycle due to favorable conditions cannot be excluded.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCulicidae 3aPica pica 3aWest Nile virus 3aautumn 3ablood serum 3adisease outbreaks 3aenzootic diseases 3afluorescent antibody technique 3ahumans 3amigratory behavior 3amigratory birds 3amonitoring 3amutation 3aneutralization 3aneutralization tests 3aneutralizing antibodies 3avirulence 3aviruses 3awild birds 3aGreece1 aTouloudi, Antonia1 aAthanasiou, Labrini V1 aGiannakopoulos, Alexios1 aIacovakis, Christos1 aBirtsas, Periklis1 aSpyrou, Vassiliki1 aDalabiras, Zisis1 aPetrovska, Liljana1 aBillinis, Charalambos0 tVirology journal.g2012 Dec., v. 9, no. 1 p.266-266dBioMed CentralwJournal:J000001738x1743-422X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1743-422X-9-2663Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02841naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002100139245009800160300001600258520140900274592002801683650001801711650002101729650003501750650000901785650001601794650001001810650002001820650002001840650001501860650003001875650002801905650001901933650001501952650001201967650001301979650002401992650002002016650001602036650002902052650001402081700002002095700002602115700001302141773011102154856007302265852000902338655001202347IND60436694120221122204701.0151021e201510  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6043669412DNAL7 a10.1111/jpy.123362doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOertel, Wolfgang10aTransformation of Ulva mutabilis (Chlorophyta) by vector plasmids integrating into the genome  ap. 963-979.  aA method for the stable transformation of the green marine macroalga Ulva mutabilis was developed based on vector plasmids integrating into the genome. By combination of the expression signals (promoter, enhancer, and transcriptional termination sequences) of a chromosomal rbcS gene from U. mutabilis with the bleomycin resistance gene (ble) from Streptoalloteichus hindustanus, a dominant selectable marker gene was constructed for the preparation of a series of E. coli—U. mutabilis shuttle vector plasmids. Special vectors were prepared for the introduction and expression of foreign genes in Ulva, for insertional mutagenesis and gene tagging by plasmid integration into the genome, and for protein tagging by the green fluorescent protein, as well as tools for posttranscriptional gene silencing and cosmid cloning to prepare genomic gene libraries for mutant gene complementation. The vectors were successfully tested in pilot experiments, where they were efficiently introduced into Ulva gametes, zoospores or protoplasts of somatic blade cells by treatment with Ca²⁺‐ions and polyethylene glycol under isotonic conditions at low ionic strength. The parthenogenetically propagated phleomycin‐resistant transformants of the mutant slender (sl) and the wildtype (wt) were demonstrated to be carrying the plasmids randomly integrated into the chromosomes often as tandem repeat clusters.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA libraries 3aRNA interference 3aStreptoalloteichus hindustanus 3aUlva 3achromosomes 3agenes 3agenetic markers 3agenetic vectors 3agerm cells 3agreen fluorescent protein 3ainsertional mutagenesis 3aionic strength 3amacroalgae 3amutants 3aplasmids 3apolyethylene glycol 3aprotein tagging 3aprotoplasts 3atranscription (genetics) 3azoospores1 aWichard, Thomas1 aWeissgerber, Adelheid1 aCock, M.0 tJournal of phycology.g2015 Oct., v. 51, no. 5 p.963-979dPhycological Society of Americax0022-36467nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jpy.123363Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03164naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002000144245010100164300002000265520125800285592002801543596009801571596009801669596010201767596010201869650001501971650001601986650002202002650001902024650001502043650001402058650001902072650001302091650001102104650002302115651001002138653001602148653001402164653002702178653002502205653003202230700001602262700001502278700001402293700005302307700005502360773014302415856007902558852000902637655001202646IND60795671220221119231037.0221005e20220921xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079567122DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.2c125372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShang, Miaomiao10aBiomimetic Core–Shell-Structured Nanofiber Membranes for Rapid and Portable Water Purification  ap. 44849-44858.  aRapid and portable water purification (RPWP) technologies, helping travelers survive in the wild, have attracted increasing interest due to increasing activities, such as exploration, field hiking, and excursion. Field water is usually pathogenic because of various soluble and insoluble contaminants. In this study, fish-gill-like biomimetic core–shell-structured nanofiber membranes are designed and synthesized by an in situ oxidation polymerization coating process. A polyimide nanofiber membrane and a polypyrrole (PPy) coating layer are employed as a core and shell, respectively. The biomimetic membranes exhibit dual-functional capacities: a rapid removal of insoluble contaminants owing to the highly porous network and broad-spectrum adsorption of soluble contaminants enabled by the PPy shell. Model studies confirm the excellent ability of the membranes to purify Cr(VI)-contaminated water to drinkable water with a safe capacity of ∼1415 L m–². Actual application tests show that the membrane can efficiently remove coliform and suspended solids in a muddy water sample taken from a river in Suzhou, China. This study provides a promising route for the design of a single-layer membrane with dual functions for highly efficient RPWP.  aPublisher supplied data  a22178178cNational Natural Science Foundation of Chinadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100001809  a91963124cNational Natural Science Foundation of Chinadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100001809  aBK20220081cNatural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Provincedhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100004608  aSJC2021008cSuzhou Municipal Science and Technology Bureaudhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100010881 3aadsorption 3abiomimetics 3acoliform bacteria 3adrinking water 3ananofibers 3aoxidation 3apolymerization 3apyrroles 3arivers 3awater purification 3aChina 0apolypyrrole 0apolyimide 0acore−shell nanofiber 0abiomimetic structure 0aportable water purification1 aMa, Bingjie1 aHu, Xueyan1 aLiu, Ling1 aWang, Jin1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1573-574X1 aZhang, Xuan1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8149-45800 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2022 Sept. 21, v. 14, no. 39 p.44849-44858dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.2c125373Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02601naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245010000166300001400266520141200280592002801692650001101720650002101731650001901752650001501771650001301786650002401799650002501823653001501848653001501863653003101878653002501909700001301934700001401947700001301961700001801974773012001992856008202112852000902194655001202203IND60638071820221121223724.0190711e201910  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063807182DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jes.2019.04.0192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJiang, Haotian10aEffects of ultrasonic treatment on dithiothreitol (DTT) assay measurements for carbon materials  ap. 51-58.  aThe dithiothreitol (DTT) assay is the most commonly used method to quantify the oxidative potential of fine particles. However, the reported DTT decay rates of carbon black (CB) materials vary greatly among different researchers. This might have resulted from either the intrinsic toxicity of CB or the unsuitability of the DTT assay protocol for CB particles. In the current study, the protocol of the DTT assay for CB materials has been carefully evaluated. It was found that the dispersion degree of CB particles in water has a great influence on the DTT decay rate of CB materials. For CB particles (special black 4A (SB4A) and Printex U) and single-walled carbon nanotube tube (SWCNT), the DTT decay rate after sonication for 10 min became 4.2, 4.6 and 1.7 times higher than that without sonication. The rate continued to grow as a function of ultrasound time up to 30 min of sonication. Although the concentration of soluble transition metals and surface oxygen-containing species such as carbonyls increased slightly with sonication, they had no significant effects on the measured DTT activity, while the increase in the dispersion degree of aggregates was found to play a vital role in the observed enhancement of the DTT decay rates for different CB materials. Based on our results, 30 min of sonication is recommended for sample dispersion when measuring the DTT decay rate of CB materials.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon 3acarbon nanotubes 3adithiothreitol 3asonication 3atoxicity 3atransition elements 3aultrasonic treatment 0aSonication 0aDispersion 0aDithiothreitol (DTT) assay 0aCarbon nanomaterials1 aXie, Yun1 aGe, Yanli1 aHe, Hong1 aLiu, Yongchun0 tJournal of environmental sciences (China).g2019 Oct., v. 84 p.51-58dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12417x1001-07427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jes.2019.04.0193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03637naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002100144245007800165300002000243520188600263592002802149650003702177650001902214650001102233650001702244650001402261650001302275650001802288650001702306650004602323650001202369650001202381650004302393650002102436650001402457650004402471650000702515650001502522650001602537650002002553650001002573653002702583653002402610653001502634653001702649653001702666700001502683700001902698700006102717700006402778773014202842856007802984852000903062655001203071IND60620667620221118003823.0181114e20181009xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062066762DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.8b137932doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSousa, Ana M. L.10aHighly Active Protein Surfaces Enabled by Plant-Based Polyphenol Coatings  ap. 39353-39362.  aProteins represent complex biomolecules capable of wide-ranging but also highly specific functionalities. Their immobilization on material supports can enable broad applications from sensing and industrial biocatalysis to biomedical interfaces and materials. We demonstrate the advantages of using aqueous-processed cross-linked polyphenol coatings for immobilizing proteins, including IgG, avidin, and various single and multidomain enzymes on diverse materials, to enable active biofunctional structures (e.g., ca. 2.2, 1.7, 1.1, and 4.8 mg·m–² active phosphatase on nanoporous cellulose and alumina, steel mesh, and polyester fabric, respectively). Enzyme assays, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, silver staining, supplemented with contact angle, solid-state ¹³C NMR, HPLC, and ESI-MS measurements were used to characterize the polyphenols, coatings, and protein layers. We show that the functionalization process may be advantageously optimized directly for protein activity rather than the traditional focus on the thickness of the coating layer. Higher activities (by more than an order of magnitude in some cases) and wider process pH and material compatibility are demonstrated with polyphenol coatings than other approaches such as polydopamine. Coatings formed from different plant polyphenol extracts, even at lowered purity (and cost), were also found to be highly functional. Chemically, our results indicate that polyphenol coatings differ from polydopamine mainly because of the elimination of amine groups, and that polyphenol layers with intermediate levels of reactivity may better lead to high immobilized protein activity. Overall, an improved understanding of simple-to-use polyphenol coatings has been obtained, which enabled a significant development in active protein surfaces that may be applied across diverse materials and nanostructured supports.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3aaluminum oxide 3aavidin 3abiocatalysis 3acellulose 3acoatings 3acontact angle 3acrosslinking 3aelectrospray ionization mass spectrometry 3aenzymes 3afabrics 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3aimmunoglobulin G 3ananopores 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3apH 3apolyesters 3apolyphenols 3asilver staining 3asteel 0aprotein immobilization 0aenzyme biocatalysis 0apolyphenol 0apolydopamine 0abiointerface1 aLi, Tai-De1 aVarghese, Sabu1 aHalling, Peter J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5077-40881 aAaron Lau, King Hang1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3676-92280 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2018 Oct. 09, v. 10, no. 45 p.39353-39362dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.8b137933Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02510naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001700152245012900169300001600298520101200314592002801326650001701354650002601371650002601397650001401423650003201437650001101469650001601480650002401496650001301520650001401533650000901547650001001556650002901566650001601595650002401611650001801635653002601653653002301679653001401702653001001716653001101726700002301737700001701760700002501777773010601802856008701908852000901995655001202004IND60536579020221121133649.0190409e201507  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053657902DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biortech.2015.01.0862doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSingh, Jyoti10aImmobilized lipase from Schizophyllum commune ISTL04 for the production of fatty acids methyl esters from cyanobacterial oil  ap. 214-218.  aNovel lipase from model mushroom Schizophyllum commune strain ISTL04 produced by solid state fermentation of Leucaena leucocephala seeds, was immobilized onto Celite for enzymatic FAMEs production from cyanobacterial endolith Leptolyngbya ISTCY101. The isolate showed vigorous growth and produced remarkable lipase activity of 146.5Ug−1 dry solid substrate, without any external lipase inducer. Single-factor experiments were carried out to study the effects of various reaction parameters on the FAMEs yield. The best conditions for enzymatic transesterification as revealed by the results were: 1:3 oil to methanol molar ratio, added at 3h intervals, 12% water content, 1581.5Ug−1 immobilized lipase, temperature 45°C, and time 24h. Under these conditions, the maximum FAMEs yield reached 94%. The immobilized lipase was able to produce >90% of the relative FAMEs yield after four repeated transesterification cycles. This immobilized lipase exhibited potential for application in biodiesel industry.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLeptolyngbya 3aLeucaena leucocephala 3aSchizophyllum commune 3abiodiesel 3acarboxylic ester hydrolases 3aesters 3afatty acids 3aimmobilized enzymes 3amethanol 3amushrooms 3aoils 3aseeds 3asolid state fermentation 3atemperature 3atransesterification 3awater content 0aSchizophyllum commune 0aImmobilized lipase 0aBiodiesel 0aFAMEs 0aCelite1 aSingh, Manoj Kumar1 aKumar, Madan1 aThakur, Indu Shekhar0 tBioresource technology.g2015 July, v. 188 p.214-218dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46263x0960-85247nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2015.01.0863Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03342naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002100139245011200160300001800272500002000290520153400310592002801844596011001872596011401982650001902096650001502115650002602130650001702156650001902173650001302192650001702205650002402222650002402246650001902270650002402289650001302313650001402326650002202340650001702362650002002379650002102399700001602420700002002436700001802456700001802474700002902492700005802521773015102579856007302730852000902803655001202812IND60612828620221118053157.0180908e201810  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061282862DNAL7 a10.1002/jctb.56532doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZeuner, Birgitte10aImmobilization of alcohol dehydrogenase on ceramic silicon carbide membranes for enzymatic CH3OH production  ap. 2952-2961.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aBACKGROUND: Alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH; EC 1.1.1.1) catalyzes oxidation of CH₃OH to CHOH during NAD⁺ reduction to NADH. ADH can also accelerate the reverse reaction, which is studied as part of cascadic enzymatic conversion of CO₂ to CH₃OH. In the present study, immobilization of ADH onto macroporous membranes of silicon carbide (SiC) was investigated for CHOH to CH₃OH conversion. RESULTS: Immobilization techniques included physical adsorption directly to the membrane and functionalization of the membrane with polyethylenimine (PEI) or (3‐aminopropyl)triethoxysilane (APTES) followed by glutaraldehyde (GA) cross‐linking. Enzyme loadings, flux, NADH conversion, and overall ADH reusability were assessed. Enzyme loadings were similar, but substrate conversion was approximately 2 and 2.5 times higher for APTES‐GA and PEI‐GA, respectively, and the relative activity retention was better than for physical adsorption. Membrane surface treatment with NaOH prior to APTES‐GA immobilization resulted in significant improvement in enzyme loading and a doubling of ADH activity as well as higher activity during recycling as the ADH destabilization rate was unaffected. CONCLUSIONS: The results provided proof‐of‐concept for the use of NaOH‐treated SiC membranes for covalent enzyme immobilization and biocatalytic efficiency improvement of ADH during multiple reaction cycles. These data have implications for the development of robust extended enzymatic reactions. © 2018 Society of Chemical Industry  aPublisher supplied data  a0603‐00522BcDanish Council for Strategic Research and The Danish Council for Technology and innovation  cDanish Polymer Centre at Department for Chemical and Biochemical Engineering, Technical University of Denmark 3aNAD (coenzyme) 3aadsorption 3aalcohol dehydrogenase 3abiocatalysis 3acarbon dioxide 3aceramics 3acrosslinking 3aenzymatic reactions 3aenzymatic treatment 3aglutaraldehyde 3aimmobilized enzymes 3amethanol 3aoxidation 3apolyethyleneimine 3aporous media 3asilicon carbide 3asodium hydroxide1 aMa, Nicolaj1 aBerendt, Kasper1 aMeyer, Anne S1 aAndric, Pavle1 aJørgensen, Jan Hoffmann1 aPinelo, Manuel1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3944-61440 tJournal of chemical technology and biotechnology.g2018 Oct., v. 93, no. 10 p.2952-2961dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl39259x0268-25757nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jctb.56533Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02861naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100003000147245010400177300001600281520156300297592002801860650001001888650002501898650001101923650002501934650001301959650001901972650001001991650001202001650002402013650002102037650002202058650000902080650001302089700002902102700002202131700002102153700002202174700002802196773011302224856008102337852000902418655001202427IND60098109120221117185023.0141104e201211  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009810912DNAL7 a10.1016/j.etp.2011.01.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEl Denshary, Ezzeldeen S.10aDietary honey and ginseng protect against carbon tetrachloride-induced hepatonephrotoxicity in rats  ap. 753-760.  aLiver diseases are amongst the most serious health problems in the world today and hepatocellular carcinoma is one of the world's deadliest cancers. The aim of the current study was to evaluate the protective effect of sider honey and/or Korean ginseng extract (KGE) against carbon tetrachloride (CCl₄)-induced hepato-nephrotoxicity in rat. Eighty male Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were allocated into different groups and over a 4-week period, they orally received honey and/or KGE or were treated either with CCl₄ alone (100mg/kg b.w) or with CCl₄ after a pretreatment period with honey, KGE or a combination of both. Clinical, clinico-pathological and histopathological evaluations were done and CCl₄-treated groups were compared with rats receiving no treatment and with rats given honey, KGE or a combination of these substances. The results indicated that oral administration of CCl₄ induced severe hepatic and kidney injury associated with oxidative stress. The combined treatment with CCl₄ plus honey and/or KGE resulted in a significant improvement in all evaluated parameters. This improvement was prominent in the group receiving CCl₄ after combined pretreatment with honey and KGE. Animals receiving honey and/or KGE (without CCl₄-treatment) were comparable to the control untreated group. It could be concluded that honey and KGE protect SD rats against the severe CCl₄-induced hepatic and renal toxic effects. Our results suggest that the protective activity of honey and KGE may have been related to their antioxidant properties.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPanax 3aantioxidant activity 3acarbon 3acarbon tetrachloride 3ahepatoma 3ahistopathology 3ahoney 3akidneys 3aoral administration 3aoxidative stress 3aprotective effect 3arats 3atoxicity1 aAl-Gahazali, Mohammad A.1 aMannaa, Fathia A.1 aSalem, Hesham A.1 aHassan, Nabila S.1 aAbdel-Wahhab, Mosaad A.0 tExperimental and toxicologic pathology.g2012 Nov., v. 64, no. 7-8 p.753-760dElsevier GmbHx0940-29937nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.etp.2011.01.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03504naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002200145245006500167300001600232520234200248592002802590650002302618650001202641650001702653650001202670650001302682650002802695650001302723650002202736650001302758650002202771650001002793650001502803651001102818700002002829700001802849700002002867773011902887856007903006852000903085655001203094IND60340751320221117225649.0150808e201508  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6034075132DNAL7 a10.1111/1365-2664.124602doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEldegard, Katrine10aEdge effects on plant communities along power line clearings  ap. 871-880.  aPower line clearings are edge‐creating disturbances in landscapes world‐wide, but there have been few studies on their bordering vegetation. Our aim was to quantify edge effects on plant communities along such clearings in Norway and to identify factors that influence these edge effects. We surveyed understorey plant communities on either side of the power line clearing–forest edge at 51 sites, along four parallel transects at each site. Each transect had four plots located, respectively, in the clearing centre, clearing edge, forest edge and forest. We quantified the magnitude of edge effects (MEE) on either side by comparing edges with their corresponding ‘non‐edge’ reference habitats. We also measured differences in species composition across the edge (clearing edge vs. forest edge). Habitat characteristics were sampled at plot and site level and from digital maps. Differences in species composition were greater between clearing centres and clearing edges than between forests and forest edges. Differences in species composition across the edge increased with edge contrast and forest productivity. Edge effects on species composition into the forest were smallest along north‐facing edges, whereas those in the clearings increased with power line age. Species richness increased slightly towards the edge in forests but decreased considerably towards the edge in clearings. The direction and MEE on either side differed among functional groups. Edge contrast and edge aspect were the prime factors influencing the MEE into forests, whereas in clearings, these were influenced principally by tree regrowth in the clearings and by forest productivity. Synthesis and applications. Edge effects on plant communities bordering power line clearings were determined by factors that can be influenced by planners and managers. For existing power lines, management plans should differentiate between the following: (i) clearings through high conservation value forests, where edge effects into the adjacent forest should be limited; (ii) clearings that can act as replacement habitat for cultural landscape species, where maintaining open‐canopy habitats should be prioritized; and (iii) ‘business‐as‐usual’ clearings, where continuing the current practice of cutting every 5–10 years is recommended.  aPublisher supplied data 3acultural landscape 3acutting 3aedge effects 3aforests 3ahabitats 3ainterspecific variation 3amanagers 3aplant communities 3aregrowth 3aspecies diversity 3atrees 3aunderstory 3aNorway1 aTotland, Ørjan1 aMoe, Stein R.1 aHooftman, Danny0 tJournal of applied ecology.g2015 Aug., v. 52, no. 4 p.871-880dBlackwell Scientific Publicationsx0021-89017nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1365-2664.124603Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03415naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002300152245011800175300001600293520195500309592002802264650001302292650001602305650002602321650001102347650001402358650001602372650002102388650001102409650001002420650001702430650001102447650001602458650001202474650001102486651001802497653002902515653001102544653002102555653002302576700002002599700001602619700002102635700001902656700002002675700001802695773008902713856008602802852000902888655001202897IND60547293720221120163413.0160903e201508  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054729372DNAL7 a10.1016/j.atmosenv.2014.12.0342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHogrefe, Christian10aAnnual application and evaluation of the online coupled WRF–CMAQ system over North America under AQMEII phase 2  ap. 683-694.  aWe present an application of the online coupled Weather Research and Forecasting–Community Multiscale Air Quality (WRF–CMAQ) modeling system to two annual simulations over North America performed under Phase 2 of the Air Quality Model Evaluation International Initiative (AQMEII). Operational evaluation shows that model performance is comparable to earlier annual applications of the uncoupled WRF/CMAQ modeling system Results also indicate that factors such as changes in the underlying emissions inventory and chemical boundary conditions likely exert a larger influence on overall model performance than feedback effects. A comparison of the simulated Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) against observations reveals a tendency toward underprediction in all seasons despite a general overprediction of PM2.5 during wintertime. Summertime sensitivity simulations without feedback effects are used to quantify the average impact of the simulated direct feedback effect on temperature, PBL heights, ozone and PM2.5 concentrations. Model results for 2006 and 2010 are analyzed to compare modeled changes between these years to those seen in observations. The results for summertime average daily maximum 8-h ozone showed that the model tends to underestimate the observed decrease in concentrations. The results for total and speciated PM2.5 vary between seasons, networks and species, but the WRF–CMAQ simulations do capture the substantial decreases in observed PM2.5 concentrations in summer and fall. These 2010–2006 PM2.5 decreases result in simulated increases of summer mean clear-sky shortwave radiation between 5 and 10 W/m2. The WRF–CMAQ configuration without direct feedback effects simulates smaller changes in summertime PM2.5 concentrations, indicating that the direct feedback effect enhances the air quality benefits arising from emission controls and that coupled modeling systems are necessary to quantify such feedback effects.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaerosols 3aair quality 3aatmospheric chemistry 3aautumn 3aemissions 3ainventories 3amodel validation 3amodels 3aozone 3aparticulates 3asummer 3atemperature 3aweather 3awinter 3aNorth America 0aWRF–CMAQ coupled model 0aAQMEII 0aDirect feedbacks 0aDynamic evaluation1 aPouliot, George1 aWong, David1 aTorian, Alfreida1 aRoselle, Shawn1 aPleim, Jonathan1 aMathur, Rohit0 tAtmospheric environment.g2015 Aug., v. 115 p.683-694dElsevier Ltdx1352-23107nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.atmosenv.2014.12.0343Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02103naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002300144245009800167300001600265520117700281592002801458653002601486653002601512653001501538653002201553653002001575700002501595773010401620856008001724852000901804655001201813IND60125772220221119204530.0151104e200805  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012577222DNAL7 a10.1525/cond.2008.84272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHumbird, Sheena K.14aThe Effects of Food Supplementation on Extraterritorial Behavior in Female Northern Cardinals  ap. 392-395.  aWe tested how food supplementation affects extraterritorial behavior in the socially monogamous Northern Cardinal (Cardinalis cardinalis). Assuming extraterritorial movements are energetically costly, we predicted that if these movements function for gaining extra-pair matings, females on supplemented territories would spend more time off territory, make more extraterritorial forays, and have larger home ranges in relation to territory size than those on unsupplemented territories. If extraterritorial movements function for foraging purposes, then supplemented females should spend less time off territory, make fewer forays, and have smaller home ranges than unsupplemented females as a result of plentiful food on their home territories. We radio-tracked seven females during their fertile periods and found a trend for supplemented females to make more extraterritorial forays and spend more time off territory than unsupplemented females; however, there was no significant difference in home range sizes between treatment groups. Our findings provide some support for the extra-pair copulation function of extraterritorial movements in female Northern Cardinals.  aPublisher supplied data 0aCardinalis cardinalis 0aextra-pair copulation 0ahome range 0aNorthern Cardinal 0aradio-telemetry1 aNeudorf, Diane L.

Because these features typically have a preferential orientation, cathodic corrosion can be applied to modify and nanostructure electrode surfaces. However, this application of cathodic corrosion is currently limited by an insufficient chemical understanding of its underlying mechanism. This includes the role of alkali metal cations, which are thought to be crucial in both enabling cathodic corrosion and controlling its final facet preference. This work addresses this knowledge gap by exploring the cathodic corrosion of Pt, Rh, and Au in LiOH, NaOH, and KOH through both experimental and theoretical methods. These methods demonstrate that cations are adsorbed during cathodic corrosion and play a major role in controlling the onset potential and final surface morphology in cathodic corrosion. Interestingly, an equally significant role appears to be played by adsorbed hydrogen, based on calculations using literature density functional theory data. Considering the significance of both hydrogen and electrolyte cations, it is hypothesized that cathodic corrosion might proceed via an intermediate ternary metal hydride. This fundamental insight leads to both metal-specific recommendations and more general guidelines for applying cathodic corrosion to structure metallic surfaces.  aPublisher supplied data 3acations 3acorrosion 3adensity functional theory 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrodes 3agold 3aguidelines 3ahydrides 3ahydrogen 3ametal ions 3ananoparticles 3aplatinum 3apotassium hydroxide 3arhodium 3asodium hydroxide 0acathodic corrosion 0acation effects 0aelectrolyte effects 0aelectrode structuring 0asurface morphology 0acation adsorption 0ahydrogen adsorption 0aternary metal hydrides1 aMcCrum, Ian T.1 aAnastasiadou, Dimitra1 aWever, Rianne1 aCalle-Vallejo, Federico1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5147-86351 aKoper, Marc T.

Tube extension requires many critical functions of plant cells including molecular signaling, cytoskeleton remodeling, secretion, and cell wall synthesis. Consequently, pollen tube growth has been established as a way to conduct primary screens of chemical libraries to identify compounds that perturb key cellular processes in plants. RESULTS: Here we report a simple, inexpensive, rapid and semi-quantitative method for measurement of pollen tube growth in microtiter plates. The method relies on Congo Red binding to pollen tubes and correlates dye fluorescence to tube length. CONCLUSIONS: This method can be used in any laboratory without specialized equipment, and has the potential to enable larger screens as chemical libraries grow and to make chemical screening accessible to researchers building specialized libraries designed to probe pathways in plant biology.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3acell walls 3acells 3acytoskeleton 3adyes 3aequipment 3afluorescence 3apollen 3apollen tubes 3ascreening 3asecretion1 aLévy, Clara,1 aKern, David M1 aJohnson, Mark A.,1 aBasu, Amit0 tPlant methods.g2014 Dec., v. 10, no. 1 p.272-272dSpringer-Verlagx1746-48117nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1746-4811-10-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02771naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245013800165300001600303520153900319592002801858650001501886650001401901650001101915650001501926650003501941650002501976650001202001650001602013650001502029650000902044650001802053650004002071700002002111700001902131700002002150773011302170856008102283852000902364655001202373IND60098109720221120032736.0141104e201211  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009810972DNAL7 a10.1016/j.etp.2011.01.0182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTogashi, Yuko10aUrinary cystatin C as a biomarker for acute kidney injury and its immunohistochemical localization in kidney in the CDDP-treated rats  ap. 797-805.  aCystatin C, a cysteine protease inhibitor, is a novel biomarker of renal damage. In the present study, we examined the urinary and plasma levels of cystatin C and how useful they are for the early detection of acute kidney injury (AKI) in CDDP-treated rats in comparison with other biomarkers (β2-microglobulin, calbindin, clusterin, EGF, GST-α, GST-μ, KIM-1, NGAL, osteopontin, TIMP-1, and VEGF). The urinary levels of cystatin C, GST-α, KIM-1, and EGF changed prior to proximal tubule damage and increases in plasma urea nitrogen and creatinine levels, suggesting their usefulness for predicting AKI. On the other hand, the plasma cystatin C level hardly changed. We also investigated the localization of cystatin C in the kidney according to the progression of renal damage. Cystatin C was predominantly localized in the proximal tubule of the cortex, and its immunohistochemical expression was not affected by CDDP treatment. In addition, cystatin C was observed in the lumen of the renal tubule in the cortex, cortico-medullary junction, and medulla during the progression of renal damage, although its immunoreactive area ratio was very low. In conclusion, urinary cystatin C measurements can detect CDDP-induced AKI as early as KIM-1, GST-α, and EGF in rats, although the change ratio of the cystatin C was smaller than others. Immunohistochemical cystatin C expression in the proximal tubule of the kidney was hardly changed by the CDDP treatment, but it was newly observed in the renal tubule lumen after CDDP treatment.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiomarkers 3acalbindin 3acortex 3acreatinine 3acysteine proteinase inhibitors 3aimmunohistochemistry 3akidneys 3aosteopontin 3aprediction 3arats 3aurea nitrogen 3avascular endothelial growth factors1 aSakaguchi, Yuka1 aMiyamoto, Mari1 aMiyamoto, Yohei0 tExperimental and toxicologic pathology.g2012 Nov., v. 64, no. 7-8 p.797-805dElsevier GmbHx0940-29937nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.etp.2011.01.0183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02937naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245012400168300001800292520156100310592002801871650001601899650002501915650001101940650002301951650002301974650001701997650001702014650001802031650001302049650001302062650001102075650001402086650001302100650001502113650001102128650001402139653001602153653001902169653001302188653001302201653001602214653002402230700001902254773008002273856008102353852000902434655001202443IND60565445420221121102027.0170711e20170504xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056544542DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tet.2017.02.0282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPratap, Ramendra10a2H-Pyran-2-ones and their annelated analogs as multifaceted building blocks for the fabrication of diverse heterocycles  ap. 2529-2590.  a2H-Pyran-2-ones are widely present in nature and found as either isolated or in fused form. Depending on the fusion of benzene ring, pyran can give coumarins, isocoumarins, dibenzopyrans etc. This class of molecules exhibit excellent biological activity and photophysical properties. Apart from these, 2H-pyran-2-one also acts as very good Michael acceptor, therefore act as very important synthetic precursor. Suitably functionalized 2H-pyran-2-one has been widely explored for their synthetic potential. In this review, we have focused on use of different nucleophiles based on carbon, nitrogen, oxygen and sulfur to generate vast molecular diversity. The functionalized 2H-pyran-2-ones exhibit three electrophilic centres with different electrophilicity. Use of suitable nucleophiles can act on either of the position based on its reactivity to generate new chemical entity. 2H-Pyran-2-one has been explored as precursor for the synthesis of various biologically important nucleuses like pyridine, pyrimidine, quinolines, isoquinolines, fused quinolines, pyrazole, pyrroles, imidazopyridine, thiazole, oxazole, fused and isolated pyrans, coumarins, isocoumarins, benzothiophenes, dibenzohiophenes, dibenzofurans, diazapines, oxahelicines, thia-oxa helicines, and various other heterocycles under base mediated conditions. Use of suitably substituted 2H-pyran-2-one and nucleophile can generate new molecular entity. In this review, we have discussed the properties, synthesis and their synthetic applications to generate various classes of heterocycles.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLewis bases 3abioactive properties 3acarbon 3achemical reactions 3achemical structure 3adibenzofuran 3aisocoumarins 3aisoquinolines 3anitrogen 3aoxazoles 3aoxygen 3apyridines 3apyrroles 3aquinolines 3asulfur 3athiazoles 0aHeterocycle 0a2H-pyran-2-one 0aCoumarin 0aChromene 0aNucleophile 0aRing transformation1 aRam, Vishnu Ji0 tTetrahedron.g2017 May 04, v. 73 p.2529-2590dElsevier Ltdx0040-40207nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tet.2017.02.0283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01725naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100001900112245010200131300001600233520069000249592002800939650002700967650001500994650002001009650001601029650001401045650001901059650001501078650002201093650001401115653002501129653002501154700002501179700001701204773014501221852000901366655001201375IND60705108720221119125456.0200731e201203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070510872DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRaj, T.

Identifying the scale at which parasitoids are affected by organic farming will be an important step to enhance their conservation. We sampled tachinid parasitoids at the centre and margin of arable and grassland fields on paired organic and conventional farms located in landscapes with different proportions of organic land. A total of 192 fields were sampled in two biogeographical regions of the UK. We found that the positive effect of organic farming on tachinid parasitoid diversity can be observed at multiple spatial scales. At the local scale, we found higher abundance and species richness of tachinid parasitoids on organic than on conventional farms and on field margins than on field centres. At the landscape scale, the diversity of tachinids was higher in landscapes with higher proportions of organic land. At both scales, the positive effect of organic farming was clear for arable fields, while it was almost neutral for grasslands. Synthesis and applications. Any attempt to enhance parasitoid diversity in agricultural landscapes needs to consider the local management in relation to the habitat type, location within the field and agricultural management in the surrounding landscape. To restore parasitoid diversity, the promotion of organic agriculture should aim to increase both the total extent of organic farming and the connectivity of individual farms. As the benefits of organic farming to biodiversity clearly spread beyond individual farm boundaries, any assessment of organic farming should consider these positive externalities.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural land 3aagricultural management 3abiogeography 3aedge effects 3afarms 3agrasslands 3ahabitats 3ainsects 3alandscapes 3aorganic production 3aparasitoids 3aspecies diversity 3aUnited Kingdom1 aCerretti, Pierfilippo1 aGabriel, Doreen1 aBenton, Tim G.1 aSait, Steven M.1 aKunin, William E.1 aGillespie, Mark A.

In addition to fixed differences in DNA sequences, recent genetics‐based descriptions within the dinoflagellate genus Symbiodinium have incorporated confirmatory morphological, physiological, and ecological evidence when possible. However, morphological and physiological data are difficult to collect from species that have not been cultured, while the natural ecologies of many cultured species remain unknown. Here, we rely on genetic evidence—the only data consistently available among all taxa investigated—to describe four new Clade B Symbiodinium species. The ‘host‐specialized’ species (S. antillogorgium sp. nov. and S. endomadracis sp. nov.) engage in mutualisms with specific cnidarian hosts, but exhibit differences in our ability to culture them in vitro. The ecologically ‘cryptic’ species (S. aenigmaticum sp. nov. and S. pseudominutum sp. nov.) thrive in culture, but their roles or functions in the ecosystem (i.e., niches) are yet to be documented. These new species call further attention to the spectrum of ecological guilds among Symbiodinium.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCnidaria 3aDNA 3aSymbiodinium 3aecosystems 3ahosts 3ain vitro culture 3amorphometry 3anew species 3aniches 3anucleotide sequences 3aCaribbean1 aCoffroth, Mary Alice1 aLaJeunesse, Todd C.1 aLin, S.0 tJournal of phycology.g2015 Oct., v. 51, no. 5 p.850-858dPhycological Society of Americax0022-36467nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jpy.123403Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02284naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002400147245009200171300001200263520090600275592002801181596005201209596003901261650001201300650002501312650003701337650001601374650001801390650003301408650001101441650001701452650001601469700002801485700002801513700001701541700003301558700002401591700002101615773013501636856008201771852000901853655001201862IND60647620920221119142853.0191104e201906  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064762092DNAL7 a10.1007/s12665-019-8369-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHassan, Norlizawati10aMicrostructural characteristics of organic soils treated with biomass silica stabilizer  ap. 367.  aChemical stabilization is extensively used to improve the physical and engineering properties of problematic soils. This research was carried out to investigate the strength and microstructural properties of organic soil treated with a biomass silica stabilizer, named SH-85. The SH-85 content studied was varied at 3, 6, 9, 12, and 15% based on the organic soil weight. Compaction and unconfined compression strength tests were carried out to ascertain the strength improvement of the stabilized organic soil. The field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) and energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometry (EDAX) were carried out to examine the growth of cementation products. The cementation products filled large and small pores and welded soil particles, which results in strong interparticle forces. Therefore, the strength of treated soil is 5–20 times higher than that of the untreated soil.  aPublisher supplied data  a4F658cMinistry of Higher Education of Malaysia  aRTA5980005cThailand Research Fund 3abiomass 3acompression strength 3aenergy-dispersive X-ray analysis 3aengineering 3aorganic soils 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asilica 3aspectroscopy 3astabilizers1 aWan Hassan, Wan Hasmida1 aRashid, Ahmad Safuan A.1 aLatifi, Nima1 aMohd Yunus, Nor Zurairahetty1 aHorpibulsuk, Suksun1 aMoayedi, Hossein0 tEnvironmental earth sciences.g2019 June, v. 78, no. 12 p.367-367dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:J000001228x1866-62807nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12665-019-8369-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02918naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100003200147245009900179300001800278520166900296592002801965650002201993650001202015650001802027650000902045650001802054650002202072650001502094650001202109650001102121650002102132650002502153650001202178650002002190650001302210650001102223650002102234700002502255700002702280773008702307856008102394852000902475655001202484IND60573241720221120023241.0170721e201612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057324172DNAL7 a10.1007/s10646-016-1720-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aReátegui-Zirena, Evelyn G.12aA cost or a benefit? Counterintuitive effects of diet quality and cadmium in Lymnaea stagnalis  ap. 1771-1781.  aDiet quality can have a strong impact on organismal fitness although diet quality is infrequently considered as a factor in toxicity tests. The purpose of this study was to assess how diets differing in nutritional content affect sensitivity to Cd as measured by several sublethal responses related directly to bioenergetics. We evaluated feeding rate, growth rate, behavior and macronutrient content in the pond snail Lymnaea stagnalis exposed to Cd and fed two different diets. Hatchlings were fed either lettuce or high-caloric pellets, and exposed to 5, 10, and 20 µg/L Cd for 12 days. Length and weight were measured at the beginning and end of the test. The amount of food eaten and behavior were determined every two days. Total lipids, proteins and carbohydrates were biochemically measured at test end. For the second part of the study, snails were fed either lettuce or pellets for 2 weeks and then exposed to high challenge concentrations of Cd. Growth coefficients based on length and weight were significantly higher for snails fed pellets. In addition, snails exposed to Cd had significantly smaller growth coefficients than those in the control for both diets. Total carbohydrates and lipids were higher for snails fed pellets while the protein content was not significantly affected by Cd or diets. Even though snails fed pellets grew significantly faster, contrary to expectations they were significantly more sensitive to Cd compared to those fed lettuce. This study provides evidence that a bioenergetics-based approach can been used to better understand how diet can affect the ecotoxicity of chemical stressors to freshwater gastropods.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLymnaea stagnalis 3acadmium 3acarbohydrates 3adiet 3aecotoxicology 3aenergy metabolism 3afreshwater 3alettuce 3alipids 3anutrient content 3anutritional adequacy 3apellets 3aprotein content 3aproteins 3asnails 3atoxicity testing1 aFidder, Bridgette N.1 aSalice, Christopher J.0 tEcotoxicology.g2016 Dec., v. 25, no. 10 p.1771-1781dSpringer USx0963-92927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10646-016-1720-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02378naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100003000144245019700174300001600371520103800387592002801425650002001453650002801473650001701501650002801518650001401546650001101560650001801571650003501589650001501624650001501639650001601654650001801670700002101688700002201709700002701731773013401758856007901892852000901971655001201980IND60764850720221118224117.0220409e20100419xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076485072DNAL7 a10.17221/187/2008-cjfs2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aModzelewska-Kapituła, M.14aThe influence of feeding diets containing white cheese, produced with prebiotics and the potentially probiotic <i>Lactobacillus plantarum</i> strain, on the gastrointestinal microflora of rats  ap. 139-145.  aThe effects of inulin HPX and maltodextrins, and also the potentially probiotic <I>Lactobacillus plantarum</I> 14 strain, used separately and in combination in white cheese production, on the gastrointestinal microflora of Wistar rats was investigated.

In this study, a carbohydrate binding module family 2 (CBM2) was successfully fused to the C terminal of GOD with a natural linker (NL) in endo-β-xylanase by genetic recombination, and a fusion GOD (GOD-NL-CBM2) was obtained. The CBM2 was used as an affinity adsorption tag for immobilization of the GOD-NL-CBM2 on a cellulose modified electrode. The specific activity of GOD-NL-CBM2 was comparable to that of the wild type GOD. In addition, the CBM2 tag of fusion GOD almost maintained its highest binding capacity under optimal catalytic conditions (pH 5.0, 50 °C). The morphology and composition analysis of the cellulose film reacted with and without GOD or GOD-NL-CBM2 confirmed the immobilization of GOD-NL-CBM2. The electrochemical properties of the GOD-NL-CBM2/cellulose film bioelectrode, with a characteristic peak of H₂O₂ at +0.6 V in the presence of glucose, revealed the capability of the immobilized GOD-NL-CBM2 to efficiently catalyze glucose and produce H₂O₂. Additionally, the current signal response of the biosensor to glucose was linear in the concentration range from 1.25 to 40 mM (r² ≥ 0.99). The sensitivity and detection limit of the GOD-NL-CBM2/cellulose film bioelectrode were 466.7 μA mol⁻¹ L cm⁻² and 0.475 mM (S/N = 3), respectively. Moreover, the glucose biosensor exhibited a rapid current change (< 5 s), high reproducibility (Relative standard deviation, RSD < 5%), substrate selectivity and stability, and retained about 80 % of the original current response after 2 months. The affinity adsorption-based immobilization strategy for GOD provides a promising approach to develop a high performance glucose biosensor.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3abiosensors 3acellulose 3adetection limit 3aelectrochemistry 3agenetic recombination 3aglucose 3aglucose oxidase 3amicroelectrodes 3apH 3astandard deviation 3atechnology 0aBiosensor 0aCellulose film 0aCarbohydrate binding module family 2 tag 0aAffinity adsorption1 aHan, Qingye1 aChen, Yanru1 aWang, Binglian1 aShi, Jianguo1 aWang, Lushan1 aCai, Lei1 aMeng, Qingjun1 aZhang, Zhenyu1 aLiu, Qingai1 aYang, Yan1 aYang, Junhui1 aZheng, Lan1 aLi, Yiwei1 aMa, Yaohong0 tEnzyme and microbial technology.g2021 Oct., v. 150 p.109869-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12419x0141-02297nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enzmictec.2021.1098693Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03633naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002000148245019700168300001800365520182800383592002802211650002402239650002502263650002502288650001602313650002702329650001602356650002102372650001302393650001602406650001502422650001802437650000902455650001902464650002002483650001502503650000902518650001202527650002302539650001402562650001102576650001302587650002402600650002502624650001402649650001602663700003802679700006502717700006702782773013802849856008302987852000903070655001203079IND60750434220221120203611.0210918e202110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075043422DNAL7 a10.1007/s10499-021-00741-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGheytasi, Abbas10aFeeding rainbow trout, Oncorhynchus mykiss, with lemon essential oil loaded in chitosan nanoparticles: effect on growth performance, serum hemato-immunological parameters, and body composition  ap. 2207-2221.  aThe dietary effect of lemon essential oil loaded in chitosan nanoparticles (LEO/CNPs) on growth performance, serum biochemical parameters, humoral immune responses, and body composition in rainbow trout was evaluated. Two hundred and forty juvenile fish (4.74 ± 0.14 g) were randomly distributed to four experimental groups with three replicates in 12 fiberglass tanks (140 L; 20 fish per tank). The fish were fed a basal diet (commercial pellet; 50.5% protein and 13.1% fat) supplemented with 0 (control), 0.5, 0.75, and 1% LEO/CNPs for 56 days. At the end of the trial, the highest final weight (32.04 ± 1.22 g), weight gain (27.40 ± 1.36 g), and specific growth rate (3.45 ±0.12% day⁻¹) were observed in 1% LEO/CPN treatment (P < 0.05). Besides, feed conversion rate significantly improved in 1% LEO/CNPs treatment (0.65 ± 0.01) compared to 0.5% LEO/CNPs (0.82 ± 0.07) and the control group (0.79 ± 0.03). Serum aspartate transaminase and alkaline phosphatase values were not affected by dietary LEO/CNPs (P > 0.05), while alanine aminotransferase level (13.21 ± 0.42 U L⁻¹) showed a significant decrease in 1 % LEO/CNPs treatment compared to 0.5% LEO/CNPs and the control group (P < 0.05). The serum cholesterol, triglycerides, and glucose were significantly reduced following the oral administration of 0.75 and 1% LEO/CNPs (P < 0.05). Lysozyme activity (32.26 ± 1.14 U mL⁻¹) and complement C3 (39.64 ± 4.76 mg dL⁻¹) significantly increased in the fish treated with 1% LEO/CNPs. The higher and lower contents of crude protein and lipid were obtained in 1% LEO/CNPs, respectively, than the control group. Overall, the synergistic interaction between LEO and CNPs in 1% LEO/CNPs treatment may be responsible for improving the growth performance and immuno-physiological responses of rainbow trout.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOncorhynchus mykiss 3aalanine transaminase 3aalkaline phosphatase 3aaquaculture 3aaspartate transaminase 3ablood serum 3abody composition 3achitosan 3acholesterol 3acomplement 3acrude protein 3adiet 3aessential oils 3afeed conversion 3afiberglass 3afish 3aglucose 3agrowth performance 3ajuveniles 3alemons 3alysozyme 3aoral administration 3aspecific growth rate 3asynergism 3aweight gain1 aHosseini Shekarabi, Seyed Pezhman1 aIslami, Houman Rajabi1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4654-14221 aMehrgan, Mehdi Shamsaie1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2445-853X0 tAquaculture international.g2021 Oct., v. 29, no. 5 p.2207-2221dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:jnl57531x0967-61207nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10499-021-00741-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02771naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245015100170300001600321520130500337592002801642650000801670650001201678650001501690650001401705650001901719650001201738650001401750650001201764650001101776650001301787650001101800650001901811650001601830653002201846653002301868653001801891653001401909700003301923700001901956700002401975700001701999700001302016700001502029700001602044773011102060856008502171852000902256655001202265IND60582078320221121025329.0180830e20171201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058207832DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fuproc.2017.08.0212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIzquierdo, M.T.10aMercury emissions from coal combustion in fluidized beds under oxy-fuel and air conditions: Influence of coal characteristics and O2 concentration  ap. 695-701.  aIn this work, the fate of mercury in a bubbling fluidized bed combustor working under oxy-combustion conditions has been studied and compared with air combustion. The influence of burning three different rank coals, with sulphur content ranging from 0.65% to 5.17%, on Hg partitioning has been studied. The presence of limestone as sorbent for SO2 capture as well as the concentration of O2 at the entrance of the combustor were also evaluated.Coal rank does not have a direct influence on coal partitioning. However, sulphur content of the coal is an important parameter to describe not only the high percentage of particle-bound mercury, up to 87%, in presence of limestone but also the prevalence of Hg(0) as the main species in the gas phase when burning the lignite. The O2/CO2 ratio has little effect on Hg partitioning in experiments carried out in presence of limestone at 925°C (the optimum temperature for sorbent sulphating under oxy-combustion conditions) and little differences are found with air combustion at 850°C (the optimum temperature for sorbent sulphating under air combustion conditions).Percentage of particle-bound mercury shows a maximum at 925°C independently of the coal studied, which it is related with the maximum sulphur retention for each coal at this temperature.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3aburning 3acombustion 3aemissions 3afluidized beds 3alignite 3alimestone 3amercury 3aoxygen 3asorbents 3asulfur 3asulfur dioxide 3atemperature 0aMercury emissions 0aOxycoal combustion 0aFluidized bed 0aLimestone1 ade las Obras-Loscertales, M.1 ade Diego, L.F.1 aGarcía-Labiano, F.1 aMendiara, T.1 aAbad, A.1 aGayán, P.1 aAdánez, J.0 tFuel processing technology.g2017 Dec. 01, v. 167 p.695-701dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12445x0378-38207nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fuproc.2017.08.0213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02950naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002200151245015300173300001600326500001500342520143500357592002801792650001101820650001401831650001301845650001701858650001201875650001601887650001401903650000901917650001401926650001101940650001301951650001601964651001301980653001501993653001602008653006302024653001902087653002102106653001202127653001902139653002202158700002002180700002602200700002902226773008302255856008502338852000902423655001202432IND60331829220221119052939.0150727e20150703xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6033182922DNAL7 a10.1080/00173134.2015.10607502doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFriis, Else Marie10aCanrightiopsis, a new Early Cretaceous fossil with Clavatipollenites-type pollen bridge the gap between extinct Canrightia and extant Chloranthaceae  ap. 184-212.  a2019-12-05  aCanrightiopsis with three species (C. intermedia, C. crassitesta, C. dinisii) is described from the Early Cretaceous of Portugal based on small, one-seeded berries. The fruits are derived from bisexual flowers with three stamens borne on one side of the ovary. There are no traces of a perianth. Pollen is of the Clavatipollenites -type, monocolpate, semitectate, reticulate-columellate with heterobrochate reticulum and muri with beaded supratectal ornamentation. The ovary is unilocular with a single pendant, orthotropous and bitegmic ovule. The seed is endotestal. The endotesta consists of one layer of palisade-shaped crystal cells with fibrous infillings. The fruit wall has resin bodies or cavities from presumed ethereal oil cells sometimes seen as stomata-like structures on the fruit surface. A phylogenetic analysis resolves Canrightiopsis as a close relative of extant Chloranthaceae, particularly close to extant Chloranthus and Sarcandra . All three taxa share the one-sided position of the stamens on the ovary. An evolutionary sequence from fossil Canrightia to fossil Canrightiopsis and extant Chloranthus and Sarcandra is suggested by loss of perianth, reduction in number of ovules and stamens and displacement of stamens to one side of the ovary. Canrightiopsis also shares several critical features with extant Ascarina including monoaperturate pollen and beaded supratectal ornamentation of the pollen wall.  aPublisher supplied data 3aovules 3aSarcandra 3apericarp 3asmall fruits 3afossils 3aChloranthus 3aphylogeny 3aoils 3areticulum 3apollen 3aperianth 3apaleobotany 3aPortugal 0aCanrightia 0aendothelium 0asynchrotron radiation X-ray tomographic microscopy (SRXTM) 0aChloranthaceae 0aEarly Cretaceous 0astamens 0afossil flowers 0aClavatipollenites1 aGrimm, Guido W.1 aMiguel Mendes, Mário1 aPedersen, Kaj Raunsgaard0 tGrana.g2015 July 3, v. 54, no. 3 p.184-212dTaylor & Francisx1651-20497nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00173134.2015.10607503Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03133naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100003400145245011900179300001600298520170100314592002802015650002402043650001302067650002002080650001902100650001402119650002502133650001602158650001602174650001402190650001802204650001602222650001602238650001002254650001802264650001302282650001502295650000902310650002102319700002102340700002002361700001902381700001602400700002402416700002002440700001802460773008002478856004802558852000902606655001202615IND4514512620221119042155.0151002e201205  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND451451262DNAL7 a10.1007/s11745-012-3667-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSenanayake, Gamarallage V. K.10aMechanisms Underlying Decreased Hepatic Triacylglycerol and Cholesterol by Dietary Bitter Melon Extract in the Rat  ap. 495-503.  aIn these studies, we focused on finding the mechanism(s) underlying the bitter melon (Momordica charantia L.) methanol fraction (MF)-dependent reduction in the concentration of hepatic triacylglycerol (TAG) and cholesterol in the rat. Rats were fed diets containing low (5Â %) fat for 2Â weeks (experiment 1), or low (5Â %) and high (15Â %) fat for a longer period of 8Â weeks (experiment 2). MF was supplemented at 1Â % level in both experiments. After feeding, rats were sacrificed, and their livers were prepared as slices and hepatocytes, followed by incubation with [1(2)-14C] acetate or [1-14C] oleic acid (18:1 n-6). Under these conditions, we found that rats fed diets containing MF, as compared to those without MF, showed: (1) no adverse effects on food intake and growth, (2) a decreased hepatic TAG and total cholesterol, irrespective of the difference in dietary fat level or feeding period, and (3) a decreased incorporation of [1(2)-14C] acetate and [1-14C] oleic acid into TAG of liver slices and hepatocytes. MF-supplemented rats also showed no altered incorporation of labeled acetate into cholesterol and cholesterol ester, an increased fecal excretion of neutral steroids, but not of acidic steroids, and an enhanced mRNA abundance of carnitine palmitoylacyltransferase I, which is the rate-limiting enzyme for fatty acid oxidation. These results suggest that dietary MF decreases hepatic TAG synthesis while enhancing fatty acid oxidation, thereby reducing the concentration of hepatic TAG. The liver cholesterol-lowering effect of MF, however, is probably mediated through an increased fecal excretion of neutral steroids, without an effect on cholesterogenesis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMomordica charantia 3aacetates 3aadverse effects 3abeta oxidation 3acarnitine 3acholesteremic effect 3acholesterol 3adietary fat 3aexcretion 3afeeding level 3afood intake 3ahepatocytes 3aliver 3amessenger RNA 3amethanol 3aoleic acid 3arats 3atriacylglycerols1 aFukuda, Nobuhiro1 aNshizono, Shoko1 aWang, Youming,1 aNagao, Koji1 aYanagita, Teruyoshi1 aIwamoto, Masako1 aOhta, Hideaki0 tLipids.g2012 May, v. 47, no. 5 p.495-503dSpringer-Verlagx0024-42017nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11745-012-3667-0  aDNAL 7aarticle01844naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001700145245009200162300001600254520081300270650001601083650001701099650002601116650002101142650000901163650001601172700001501188700001401203700001901217700001801236773010201254852000901356856008501365930003301450946001101483655001201494IND4419040420221120193906.0090410e200904  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441904042DNAL7 a10.1365/s10337-009-0959-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Yu-Juan 10aDevelopment and Validation of an LC Method for Determination of Swertisin in Rat Plasma  ap. 795-797.  aA simple and sensitive reversed phase liquid chromatographic method with UV detection was developed and validated for determination of swertisin in rat plasma.

Widely used models such as ORYZA1 give much consideration to environmental effects on growth (e.g. carbon assimilation) but assume that assimilate partitioning among organs is dependent of the environment, thereby allowing for no or little phenotypic plasticity. The present study evaluated the effects of nitrogen (N) nutrition on dry matter and N partitioning, using data from previous studies in the Philippines on irrigated transplanted and direct-seeded IR64 rice fertilized with six levels of N in one, and two levels in another study. Nitrogen application reduced dry matter partitioning to roots, particularly in direct-seeded rice. High N resources significantly increased dry matter partitioning to leaf blades at the expense of stems, but did not affect partitioning between panicles and the rest of the plant. Partitioning of dry matter to leaves decreased as the N concentration in the leaves (LNC) decreased, regardless of the cause of low LNC: low N rate, high population in direct-seeded rice, or phenological stage of the crop. Leaf partitioning of absorbed N, compared to dry matter, was high and varied little during early vegetative growth, but varied strongly from panicle initiation onwards, probably due to competition for N between leaves and the stem and the developing panicle. The possible structure of models that would simulate plasticity of assimilate and N partitioning is discussed on the basis of organ-specific phenological time axes and interacting supply and demand functions. The underlying assumption is that the observed effects of N nutrition on partitioning are mediated by the size of incremental assimilate pools. 3aOryza sativa 3agrowth models 3asimulation models 3aplant organs 3anitrogen 3aplant nutrition 3airrigation 3aroots 3aleaves 3astems 3ainflorescences 3amorphogenesis 3acrop yield 3aregression analysis 3aphenotype 3aPhilippines 0adry matter0 tAgricultural systems.g1996 , v. 52, no. 2/3 p.383-397x0308-521X7nnas  aDNAL  a19980401b19980408c00000000  aINDdTBT  aNon-US 7aarticle02996naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002200164245013600186300001600322520132000338650001601658650004901674650001501723650001201738650001601750650003501766650004301801650003001844650000901874650002501883650004701908650004901955650000902004653003102013653004302044653002202087653002902109653002702138653001702165700001802182700001602200700001802216773011802234852000902352856008502361930003302446946001102479655001202490IND4434312820221120184013.0100319e201004  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443431282DNAL7 a202043952pmid7 a10.1007/s00422-010-0370-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTaxidis, Jiannis 10aAssessing cortico-hippocampal functional connectivity under anesthesia and kainic acid using generalized partial directed coherence  ap. 327-340.  aA significant challenge in modern neuroscience lies in determining the functional connectivity between discrete populations of neurones and brain regions. In this study, a variation of partial directed coherence, the generalized partial directed coherence (gPDC), along with a newly proposed critical value for gPDC, were applied on recorded local field potentials (LFPs) and single-unit activity, in order to assess information flow between medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and hippocampus and within the hippocampus of the rat brain, under isoflurane anesthesia and kainic acid-induced enhanced neuronal activity. Our findings suggest that, under anesthesia, there exists a continuous information flow from hippocampus towards mPFC, reversed mostly during activity bursts occurring in the mPFC. Moreover, there was a clear directional connection from the lateral towards medial dorsal hippocampus, most prominent in the beta frequency band (10-30 Hz). Kainic acid resulted in partially disrupting the reciprocal cortico-hippocampal connectivity and reversing the intra-hippocampal one. The biological implications of these findings on the effects of anesthesia and kainic acid in brain connectivity, along with implementation issues of gPDC analysis on field potentials and spike trains, are extensively discussed. 3ahippocampus 2aAction Potentialsxdrug effectsxphysiology. 2aAnesthesia 2aAnimals 2aCybernetics 2aElectrophysiological Phenomena 2aHippocampusxdrug effectsxphysiology. 2aKainic Acidxpharmacology 2aMale 2aModels, Neurological 2aNeural Pathwaysxdrug effectsxphysiology. 2aPrefrontal Cortexxdrug effectsxphysiology. 2aRats 0aPartial directed coherence 0aGeneralized partial directed coherence 0aGranger causality 0aMedial prefrontal cortex 0aLocal field potentials 0aSpike trains1 aCoomber, Ben 1 aMason, Rob 1 aOwen, Markus 0 tBiological cybernetics.g2010 Apr., v. 102, no. 4 p.327-340dBerlin/Heidelberg : Springer-Verlagx0340-12007nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00422-010-0370-13Available from publisher's Web site  a20100319b20100403c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03175naa a2200637 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024003800133040001800171072001700189100001900206245011200225506007600337520123100413506003701644650001701681650000901698650002101707650003201728650002201760650004301782650001201825650001101837650002001848650001701868650001301885650002501898650005201923650001201975650002101987650001302008650001402021650002702035650003102062650002102093650001402114650002402128651001902152651001102171700002502182700002002207700001902227700001802246700001802264700001902282773005602301852000902357856008802366930003302454945002502487946001302512655001202525IND4436494220221207072226.0100504e200910  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443649422DNAL7 a198061972pmid7 aPMC27521592pmcid7 a10.1371/journal.pone.00073352doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Although originally it was thought that interspecific hybridization is impossible without biotechnological methods, progenies of hybridization appear to occur in farmer fields. AFLP analysis was used to assess genetic diversity in West Africa (including the countries The Gambia, Senegal, Guinea Bissau, Guinea Conakry, Sierra Leone, Ghana and Togo) using 315 rice samples morphologically classified prior to analysis. We show evidence for farmer interspecific hybrids of African and Asian rice, resulting in a group of novel genotypes, and identify possible mechanisms for in-field hybridization. Spontaneous back-crossing events play a crucial role, resulting in different groups of genetic diversity in different regions developed by natural and cultural selection, often under adverse conditions. These new groups of genotypes may have potential relevance for exploitation by plant breeders. Future advances in crop development could be achieved through co-operation between scientists and marginalized farmer groups in order to address challenges of rapid adaptation in a world of increasing socio-political and climatic uncertainty.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aOryza sativa 3arice 3aOryza glaberrima 3ainterspecific hybridization 3agenetic variation 3aamplified fragment length polymorphism 3ahybrids 3afields 3acrop production 3abackcrossing 3agenotype 2aAgriculturexmethods 2aAmplified Fragment Length Polymorphism Analysis 2aChimera 2aCrosses, Genetic 2aGenotype 2aGeography 2aHybridization, Genetic 2aNucleic Acid Hybridization 2aOryzaxgenetics. 2aPhylogeny 2aSpecies Specificity 3aWestern Africa 0aAfrica1 aTreuren, Robbert van1 aStruik, Paul C.1 aMokuwa, Alfred1 aOkry, Florent1 aTeeken, Béla1 aRichards, Paul0 tPloS one.g2009 Oct., v. 4, no. 10x1932-62037nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.00073353Available from publisher's Web site  a20100617b20100703c00000000  aINDdRHFe2010/06/17  aOther US 7aarticle01611naa a2200313 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002200145245006000167300001600227500002400243520068100267650002400948650001500972650001700987650001001004650000901014650001901023650001201042651001501054700002001069773010201089852000901191856008501200655001201285IND4418746420221120164003.0090403s2009    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441874642DNAL7 a10.1007/s10498-008-9052-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGreen, William J.14aThe Saline Lakes of the McMurdo Dry Valleys, Antarctica  ap. 321-348.  aIncludes references  aThe McMurdo Dry Valleys of Antarctica are among a rare group of ice-free regions lying along the coast of an otherwise ice-burdened continent.

On that basis, combined with the tectonic characteristics of the plateau, the hydrochemical characteristics of the salt lakes of the plateau are discussed. The salinity of the lakes of the plateau is closely related to the natural environment of lake evolution, especially the climatic conditions. According to the available data and interpretation of satellite images, the salinity of the lakes of the plateau has a general trend of decreasing from north and northwest to south and southeast, broadly showing synchronous variations with the annual precipitation and aridity (annual evaporation/annual precipitation) of the modern plateau. The pH values of the plateau salt lakes are related to both hydrochemical types and salinities of the lake waters, i.e., the pH values tend to decrease from the carbonate type [rightward arrow] sodium sulfate subtype [rightward arrow] magnesium sulfate subtype [rightward arrow] chloride type; on the other hand, a negative correlation is observed between the pH and salinities of the lakes. Geoscientists and biological limnologists generally use main ions in salt lakes as the basis for the hydrochemical classification of salt lakes. The common ions in salt lakes are Ca²⁺, Mg²⁺, Na⁺, K⁺, Cl⁻ SO₄ ²⁻, CO₃ ²⁻, and HCO₃ ⁻. In this paper, the Kurnakov-Valyashko classification is used to divide the salt lakes into the chloride type, magnesium sulfate subtype, sodium sulfate subtype and carbonate type, and then according to different total alkalinities (K C = Na₂CO₃ + NaHCO₃/total salt x 100%) and different saline mineral assemblages, the carbonate type is further divided into three subtypes, namely, strong carbonate subtype, moderate carbonate subtype and weak carbonate subtypes. According to the aforesaid hydrochemical classifications, a complete and meticulous hydrochemical classification of the salt lakes of the plateau has been made and then a clear understanding of the characteristics of N-S hydrochemical zoning and E-W hydrochemical differentiation has been obtained. The plateau is divided into four zones and one area. There is a genetic association between certain saline minerals and specific salt lake hydrochemical types: the representative mineral assemblages of the carbonate type of salt lake is borax (tincalconite) and borax-zabuyelite (L₂CO₃) and alkali carbonate-mirabilite; the representative mineral assemblages of the sodium sulfate subtype are mirabilite (thenardite)-halite and magnesium borate (kurnakovite, inderite etc.)-ulexite-mirabilite; the representative mineral assemblages of the magnesium sulfate subtype are magnesium sulfate (epsomite, bloedite)-halite, magnesium borate-mirabilite, and mirabilite-schoenite-halite, as well as large amount of gypsum; The representative mineral assemblages of the chloride type are carnallite-bischofite-halite and carnallite-halite, with antarcticite in a few individual salt lakes. The above-mentioned salt lake mineral assemblages of various types on the plateau have features of cold-phase assemblages. Mirabilite and its associated cold-phase saline minerals are important indicators for the study of paleoclimate changes of the plateau. A total of 59 elements have been detected in lake waters of the plateau now, of which the concentrations of Na, K, Mg, Ca, and Cl, and SO₄ ²⁻, CO₃ ²⁻, and HCO₃ ⁻ ions are highest, but, compared with the hydrochemical compositions of other salt lake regions, the plateau salt lakes, especially those in the southern Qiangtang carbonate type subzone (I₂), contain high concentrations of Li, B, K, Cs, and Rb, and there are also As, U, Th, Br, Sr, and Nd positive anomalies in some lakes. In the plateau lake waters, B is intimately associated with Li, Cs, K and Rb and its concentration shows a general positive correlation with increasing salinity of the lake waters. The highest positive anomalies of B, Li, Cs, and K center on the Ngangla Ringco Lake area in the western segment of the southern Qiangtang carbonate type subzone (I₂) and coincide with Miocene volcanic-sedimentary rocks and high-value areas of B, Li, and Cs of the plateau. This strongly demonstrates that special elements such as B, Li, and Cs on the plateau were related to deep sources. Based on recent voluminous geophysical study and geochemical study of volcanic rocks, their origin had close genetic relation to anatectic magmatism resulting from India-Eurasia continent-continent collision, and B-Li (-Ce) salt lakes in the Cordillera Plateau of South America just originated on active continental margins, both of which indicate that global specific tectonically active belts are the main cause for the high abundances of B, Li, and Cs (K and Rb) in natural water and mineralization of these elements. 3aarsenic 3aatmospheric precipitation 3aborax 3abromine 3acalcium 3achlorides 3aclimatic factors 3aepsomite 3aevaporation 3ageophysics 3agypsum 3ahydrochemistry 3alakes 3amagnesium 3amagnesium borate 3amagnesium sulfate 3amineralization 3amirabilite 3apH 3apaleoclimatology 3aplateaus 3apotassium 3aremote sensing 3asalinity 3asodium 3asodium carbonate 3asodium sulfate 3astrontium 3atectonics 3athenardite 3avolcanic rocks 3azoning 3aChina 3aSouth America1 aLiu, Xifang0 tAquatic geochemistry.g2009 Feb., v. 15, no. 1-2 p.293-320dSpringer Netherlandsx1380-61657nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10498-008-9055-y3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02294naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001900110245012000129300001600249520123000265650002501495650002801520650002201548650002601570650001301596650001601609650001401625650002101639650002601660650002401686650003001710650001801740650002201758773007401780852000901854930003301863945001301896946001101909655001201920IND2061628720221120163734.0980202e199612  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND206162872DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCurtis, R.H.C.10aIdentification and in situ and in vitro characterization of secreted proteins produced by plant-parasitic nematodes  ap. 589-597.  aSecretions of plant-parasitic nematodes which are released into plant tissue may play critical roles in plant-nematode interactions. The identification and characterization of these molecules are of fundamental importance and may help to facilitate the development of novel strategies to interfere with nematode infection of plants and thereby decrease nematode-induced damage to crops. An antibody-based approach was used to isolate molecules present on the nematode surface and in nematode secretions. Monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) were produced to secretions and to whole Heterodera avenae 2nd-stage juveniles; several of these MAbs recognized molecules present in nematode secretions produced in vitro. Three of these molecules have been partly characterized in H. avenae, Globodera rostochiensis, G. pallida and Meloidogyne incognita. A MAb reacting with the surfaces of these nematodes recognized antigens of different molecular weight in each of the species tested. This difference in antigenicity might be related to specific functions in these nematodes. Preliminary results show that this antibody also localized the antigen in root cells surrounding the feeding site induced by M. incognita in Arabidopsis thaliana. 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3aGlobodera rostochiensis 3aHeterodera avenae 3aMeloidogyne incognita 3aantigens 3acrop damage 3ajuveniles 3amolecular weight 3amonoclonal antibodies 3anematode infections 3aplant parasitic nematodes 3aplant tissues 3aprotein secretion0 tParasitology.g1996 Dec., v. 113, no. pt.6 p.589-597x0031-18207nnas  aDNAL  a19980301b19980309c00000000  aINDdCLD  aNon-US 7aarticle03054naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001400110245011900124300001600243520176800259650002502027650001302052650001002065650001002075650001302085650001902098650001102117650002202128650001302150650001402163650001002177650001702187650001602204650001202220650001602232650001502248650001102263651001102274651001002285651001002295651002802305700001602333700001802349700001502367700001402382773007402396852000902470930003302479945001302512946001102525655001202536IND2061627220221120163713.0980202e199612  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND206162722DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPozio, E.10aEnvironmental and human influence on the ecology of Trichinella spiralis and Trichinella britovi in Western Europe  ap. 527-533.  aSurveys on Trichinella parasites in domestic and sylvatic animals collected in France, Italy, and in the Extremadura region of Spain showed that the distribution of Trichinella spiralis and Trichinella britovi is influenced by both environmental and human behaviour factors. In France, both Trichinella species are prevalent in the fox population from mountain areas and natural parks but are infrequent in wild boars (< 0.001 %). In Italy, only T. britovi is present in sylvatic animals (foxes, wolves, and mustelids) living 500 m above sea level. This species is rare in wild boars (< 0.001 %) in that area. Sylvatic trichinellosis is found in only 24% and 34% of French and Italian territory, respectively, while lowland areas may generally be considered Trichinella-free, because the domestic cycle is absent. The ecology of T. spiralis and T. britovi in the Extremadura shows a different picture from that observed in France and Italy because of the presence of both domestic and sylvatic cycles. The domestic cycle not only allows the maintenance of T. spiralis in the domestic environment, but it also has a great impact on the prevalence in wild boar populations. It does not influence the prevalence in vulpine populations. These data suggest (1) that domestic trichinellosis occurs only in rural areas of Western Europe in association with traditional swine-rearing practices, but not in industrialized pig farms; (2) that sylvatic trichinellosis occurs only in natural habitats which, in Western Europe, are widespread in mountain areas; (3) that the fox is the primary reservoir in the sylvatic cycle, where the parasite is maintained in a closed circuit and (4) that among sylvatic animals T. spiralis is present at lower altitude than is T. britovi. 3aTrichinella spiralis 3aaltitude 3afarms 3afoxes 3ahabitats 3ahuman behavior 3ahumans 3aindustrialization 3alowlands 3aparasites 3aparks 3arare species 3arural areas 3asurveys 3atrichinosis 3awild boars 3awolves 3aFrance 3aItaly 3aSpain 3aWestern European region1 aLa Rosa, G.1 aSerrano, F.J.1 aBarrat, J.1 aRossi, L.0 tParasitology.g1996 Dec., v. 113, no. pt.6 p.527-533x0031-18207nnas  aDNAL  a19980301b19980309c00000000  aINDdCLD  aNon-US 7aarticle02232naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001800110245009600128300001600224520128900240650000901529650001201538650001501550650003501565650002201600650002401622650002501646650002401671651001701695653000901712700001901721773007601740852000901816930003301825945001301858946001101871655001201882IND2123774120221120153610.0980630e199702  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND212377412DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLourens, U.W.12aA computerized crop-specific drought monitoring system: design concepts and initial testing  ap. 303-315.  aA near real-time crop-specific drought monitoring system that combines crop modelling and a geographical information system (GIS) has been developed in South Africa. The system is intended to provide decision support for resource managers concerned with drought aid. Individual crop growth simulations are run for cells representing an area of 14 km2. Values of weather elements used to drive the models are obtained from interpolation of ground observations and processing of weather satellite imagery. Monitoring is undertaken throughout a production season, with updates provided on a fortnightly basis. Predictions of expected yield at the end of the season are made by using observed data up to the current date and completing the season with surrogate historical weather data. Appropriate surrogate scenarios are chosen, based on the synoptic situation in the current season. Maps and tabulated information are produced showing the spatial distribution of drought-stricken areas and the intensity of the drought in these areas. Favourable comparisons were obtained for recorded average maize yields and simulated average maize yields per magisterial district.

Maturity of compost was assessed through changes in C:N ratio. Results of spectroscopic properties (200 wavelengths) were studied with several multivariate analyses. First, a descriptive approach revealed compost changes with time of maturation. Then, a constrained ordination (RDA with permutation tests) demonstrated a significant effect of three factors of sampling: stage of composting, depth and position in windrows. Precise calibration models between spectral data, the C, N, C:N values and composting time were build using partial least square regression (r ² >0.95). Together, these results show the efficiency of NIRS to predict chemical changes and the stage of transformation of organic matter during the composting process. 3aorganic matter 3acompost maturity 3asewage sludge 3amodels 3aleast squares 3anear-infrared spectroscopy 3agreen waste 3acarbon nitrogen ratio 3awavelengths 3aspectral analysis 3acomposting 3aprediction 2aCarbonxanalysis 2aKinetics 2aNitrogenxanalysis 2aOrganic Chemicalsxanalysis 2aSoilxanalysis. 2aSpectrophotometry, Infraredxmethods 2aTime Factors 0anear-infrared reflectance spectroscopy 0amultivariate analysis1 aJoffre, Richard1 aGros, Raphaël1 aLe Petit, Jean1 aTerrom, Gérard1 aPérissol, Claude0 tBioresource technology.g2008 Jan., v. 99, no. 2 p.448-455dElsevier Ltd.x0960-85247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2006.12.019 7aarticle02371naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001200153245005700165300001400222500014900236520089300385650002501278650000901303650001401312650001001326650001401336650001201350650001201362650001201374650001101386650001501397650001101412650000901423650002201432650001001454650001901464650001701483650001801500650001901518650001601537651001001553700001201563700001301575700001101588700001101599700001401610700001201624773014201636856005401778852000901832655001201841IND60593160220221120133037.0180425e20171205xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059316022DNAL7 a10.17660/ActaHortic.2017.1185.32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Q.10aSymplocos paniculata: a new ornamental plant species  ap. 11-20.  aPaper presented at the II International Symposium on Germplasm of Ornamentals held August 8-12, 2016, Atlanta, Georgia, United States of America  aSymplocos paniculata is a widespread species in China with unique ornamental characteristics such as dark green evergreen leaves, fragrant creamy white flowers, sapphire-blue berries, and rough yellowish-brown and corky bark. It is easy to grow, drought and high soil salinity tolerant, and resistant to pests. Thus, it is considered a potential ornamental plant for urban landscapes. Recently, attention has been paid to the development and utilization of its fruit oil for bio-diesel production. However, little research-based information is available on its potential for ornamental use. This paper highlights the progress of the selection of novel cultivars and reviews the propagation techniques including seed propagation, cutting, grafting, and tissue culture. Such information plays a vital role in the development of this species for commercial production for the Green Industry. 3aSymplocos paniculata 3abark 3abiodiesel 3acolor 3acultivars 3acutting 3adrought 3aflowers 3afruits 3alandscapes 3aleaves 3aoils 3aornamental plants 3apests 3asalt tolerance 3asmall fruits 3asoil salinity 3atissue culture 3aurban areas 3aChina1 aSun, Y.1 aChen, J.1 aLi, P.1 aLi, C.1 aJiang, L.1 aNiu, G.0 tActa horticulturae.g2017 Dec. 5, , no. 1185 p.11-20dInternational Society for Horticultural Science.wJournal:jnl46289x0567-75727nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.17660/ActaHortic.2017.1185.3  aDNAL 7aarticle02881naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001300153245007100166300001400237500014900251520153500400650001601935650001301951650001901964650001301983650001401996650001202010650001102022650001102033650001402044650001902058650001602077651001002093700001502103700001202118700001202130700001402142700001702156700001302173700001502186700001702201773014202218856005402360852000902414655001202423IND60593160620221120133105.0180425e20171205xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059316062DNAL7 a10.17660/ActaHortic.2017.1185.72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTang, J.10aGermplasm resources and breeding of mei, an ornamental woody plant  ap. 35-46.  aPaper presented at the II International Symposium on Germplasm of Ornamentals held August 8-12, 2016, Atlanta, Georgia, United States of America  aMei (Prunus mume Sieb.et Zucc.), originated in the Hengduan Mountains region in China, has been domesticated as an important ornamental and fruit plant for more than 3,000 years. The distribution of germplasm resources of mei and its cold-resistance breeding and new cultivar breeding for both flower and fruit purposes had been reviewed. Mei has an abundant wild and semi-wild resources mainly distributed in southwestern China. Through long-term selection and breeding, mei has been domesticated to yield about 380 cultivars in 15 distinct regions of 20 Chinese provinces, some of which survive more than two hundred years (known as ancient mei). There are 75 ancient mei identified in six southwestern and southeastern provinces. Also, tremendous effort has been made to select mei for its cold hardiness, especially 'Three-North Areas' of China. By crossbreeding with apricot, a much cold-hardy species and many cold-resistance cultivars, such as 'Yan Xing', 'Hua Hudie', and 'Shan Taobai', had been cultivated in the past 60 years. These cultivars could tolerate and resist cold temperature of -15 to -35°C. Furthermore, according to the criteria developed on the basis of field investigations of mei cultivars in six provinces, several new cultivars for both flowers and fruits that including 'Yanwen Fenghou', 'Yulong Hongfei' and 'Judian No. 1' were selected and introduced. As an ornamental woody plant, mei has proven itself to be an important model plant for studying the evolution and diversification of genus Prunus. 3aPrunus mume 3aapricots 3acold tolerance 3acrossing 3acultivars 3aflowers 3afruits 3amodels 3amountains 3aplant breeding 3atemperature 3aChina1 aSun, L.

No Fusarium species known to produce fumonisin were detected, but black Aspergilli had high incidences on both Arabica and Robusta Thai coffee beans. Liquid chromatography (LC) with high-resolution mass spectrometric (HRMS) detection showed that 67% of Aspergillus niger isolates from coffee beans were capable of producing fumonisins B2 (FB2) and B4 when grown on Czapek Yeast Agar with 5% NaCl. Small amounts (1-9.7 ng g-1) of FB2 were detected in seven of 12 selected coffee samples after ion-exchange purification and LC-MS/MS detection. Two samples also contained FB4. This is the first record of freshly isolated A. niger strains producing fumonisins and the first report on the natural occurrence of FB2 and FB4 in coffee. 3afumonisin B4 3afumonisin B2 3aAspergillus niger 3atoxigenic strains 3aquantitative analysis 3apostharvest diseases 3aCoffea arabica 3aCoffea canephora 3asecondary metabolites 3afood pathogens 3acoffee beans 3amolds (fungi) 0atoxic substances1 aMahakarnchanakul, W.1 aNielsen, K.F.1 aFrisvad, J.C.1 aSamson, R.A.0 tFood additives & contaminants.

Three types of responses were noted: positive, negative, and questionable. Prediction equations indicated that 95% of the time, analysts unfamiliar with the technique could detect positive results if penicillin concentrations in samples were 0.010 unit/ml or higher and positive and questionable results if the penicillin concentrations were 0.008 unit/ml. Increasing the reconstitution ratio from 1/11 to 1/4 increased the chances of detecting penicillin in milk powder.

All of the cultures had slight ability to cause release of 14CO2 from carboxyl 14C-tyrosine and most released 14CO2 from labeled histidine; however, because of inherent errors of the assay in detecting low levels of specific decarboxylase activity, the CO2 release was not considered positive for specific decarboxylase activity unless the results were verified by the manometric technique. One strain of Streptococcus lactis, a Micrococcus luteus strain, and two Leuconostoc cremoris strains had active tyrosine decarboxylase systems. Only Clostridium perfringens and an Escherichia coli strain were found to produce histidine decarboxylase. None of the commercial starter cultures produced the enzymes. It was not determined whether tyramine or histamine was produced by the nonspecific decarboxylase activity. 3aClostridium perfringens 3aEscherichia coli 3aLactococcus lactis 3aLeuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. cremoris 3aMicrococcus luteus 3abacteria 3acarbon dioxide 3aenzyme activity 3ahistamine 3ahistidine 3ahistidine decarboxylase 3aradiometry 3astarter cultures 3atyramine 3atyrosine 3atyrosine decarboxylase1 aEitenmiller, R.

The inquiry led to examination of commercially prepared dehydrated dog foods. Twenty-five samples, representing four different manufacturers plus two retail store brands, were examined. Each of 11 samples, produced by one manufacturer, contained one or more Salmonella serotypes. Eight of them contained S. enteritidis serotype Havana. Isolates of serotype Havana from the index case and her mother had antibiotic susceptibility patterns essentially identical to those of nine of 10 serotype Havana isolates recovered from one sample of dog food. The possibility that the human isolates were related to the dog food isolates could not be eliminated. 3aSalmonella Enteritidis 3aantibiotic resistance 3afemales 3ahuman diseases 3ahumans 3apet foods 3aserotypes1 aSilver, K.

Forty-nine naïve assessors, including 25 European and 24 Chinese, were selected to assess 17 sensory attribute of 18 Chinese-style marinades, anonymously coded according to their specific flavor group: (1) Szechuan, SZ (A-D); (2) Sweet and Sour, SS (E-J); (3) Hoisin, HO (K-P); and (4) Chinese 5 Spice, FS (Q-R). The attributes includes color (bright red, dark brown, color penetration), aroma (liking, pungency, spiciness), flavor (liking, spiciness, hotness), specific flavor ratings (Szechuan, Sweet and Sour, Hoisin, Barbeque, Chinese 5 Spice, authenticity), juiciness and overall acceptability. The instrumental color of the cooked samples and pH, moisture and fat content of the marinades were also analyzed instrumentally. Marinades were applied to the chicken fillets and dry cooked at 170C for 15 min to an internal temperature of 73C. Sensory evaluation showed that there were significant differences between both naïve assessor groups in all attributes measured, excluding bright red color, sweet and sour and flavor authenticity (P < 0.05). Samples marinated with marinades FS-Q and SS-G received the highest score in term of overall acceptability by the European assessors, whereas HO-L was chosen by the Chinese assessor group. The European naïve assessors were also found to successfully differentiate the Chinese marinade products according to four specific flavors (Szechuan, Sweet and Sour, Hoisin and Chinese 5 Spice). Although the optimal characteristics of an ideal Chinese marinade were identified by the European group, the Chinese perception for Chinese-style marinated products available in the Irish market were less acceptable and were considered non-authentic. The findings from this research will benefit marinade and marinated chicken product manufacturers, when developing or optimizing their ethnic products for the local and international markets. The European naïve consumers were found to successfully differentiate the Chinese marinade products according to four specific flavors. Although the optimal characteristics of an ideal Chinese marinade were identified by the European, the Chinese naïve assessor's perception for Chinese-style marinade products available in the Irish market were less acceptable and lacking in authenticity. These results are of interest to individuals undertaking cross cultural consumer studies, even though the results presented here used naïve assessors. 3abreasts 3acolor 3across cultural studies 3afillets 3aflavor 3ainternal temperature 3ajuiciness 3amarinating 3amarkets 3aodors 3apH 3asensory evaluation 3aspices 3awater content1 aO'Sullivan, M.G.1 aKerry, J.F.1 aKerry, J.P.0 tJournal of sensory studies.g2009 Aug., v. 24, no. 4 p.512-533dBlackwell Publishing Incx0887-82507nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1745-459X.2009.00224.x 7aarticle03311naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002000152245008700172300001400259520190000273650001302173650001002186650001602196650001102212650001102223650002102234650001102255650001902266650001302285650002302298650001502321650002602336650002502362650002002387650002402407650001502431650001002446650001902456650001802475653001502493653002402508700001802532773012202550852000902672856009202681930003302773946001102806655001202817IND4431598320221120092725.0100122e201002  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443159832DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1745-4603.2009.00211.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSAIEDIRAD, M.H.10aPrediction of mechanical properties of cumin seed using artificial neural networks  ap. 34-48.  aIn this paper, two artificial neural networks (ANNs) are applied to acquire the relationship between the mechanical properties and moisture content of cumin seed, using the data of quasi-static loading test. In establishing these relationship, the moisture content, seed size, loading rate and seed orientation were taken as the inputs of both models. The force and energy required for fracturing of cumin seed, under quasi-static loading were taken as the outputs of two models. The activation function in the output layer of models obeyed a linear output, whereas the activation function in the hidden layers were in the form of a sigmoid function. Adjusting ANN parameters such as learning rate and number of neurons and hidden layers affected the accuracy of force and energy prediction. Comparison of the predicted and experimented data showed that the ANN models used to predict the relationships of mechanical properties of cumin seed have a good learning precision and good generalization, because the root mean square errors of the predicated data by ANNs were rather low (4.6 and 7.7% for the force and energy, respectively). Cumin seed is generally used as a food additive in the form of powder for imparting flavor to different food preparations and for a variety of medicinal properties. Physical properties of cumin seeds are essential for the design of equipment for handling, harvesting, aeration, drying, storing, grinding and processing. For powder preparation especially the fracture behavior of the seeds are essential. These properties are affected by numerous factors such as size, form and moisture content of the grain and deformation speed. A neural network model was developed that can be used to predict the relationships of mechanical properties. Artificial neural network models are powerful empirical models approach, which can be compared with mathematical models. 3aaeration 3acumin 3adeformation 3adrying 3aenergy 3aequipment design 3aflavor 3afood additives 3agrinding 3ahandling machinery 3aharvesting 3amechanical properties 3amedicinal properties 3aneural networks 3aphysical properties 3aprediction 3aseeds 3athermodynamics 3awater content 0aCumin seed 0amechanical strength1 aMIRSALEHI, M.0 tJournal of texture studies.g2010 Feb., v. 41, no. 1 p.34-48dMalden, USA : Blackwell Publishing Incx0022-49017nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1745-4603.2009.00211.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20100122b20100205c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02392naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001300152245009300165300001600258500002400274520122600298650002301524650001201547650001301559650001401572650001001586650000901596650002201605653002101627653001001648653001901658700001901677700001201696700001401708700001401722700002001736700001101756700001201767700001601779773009901795852000901894856005501903655001201958IND4443422420221120061237.0101015e201010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444342242DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1439-0523.2009.01706.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, X.10aCharacterization of Pi-ta blast resistance gene in an international rice core collection  ap. 491-501.  aIncludes references  aWith 3 figures and 3 tables The Pi-ta gene in rice prevents the infections by races of Magnaporthe oryzae containing AVR-Pita. In the present study, 1790 accessions were characterized for Pi-ta, and Pi-ta independent resistance genes using marker analysis, disease evaluation with the race IB-49 carrying AVR-Pita, and IE-1k not carrying AVR-Pita and sequence analysis. A total of 183 accessions were identified using a Pi-ta-indel marker from the intron region. Sequence analysis revealed that resistance functional nucleotide polymorphism (FNP) was present in 163 accessions including reference cultivars. Among them, 89 were resistant to IB-49 and susceptible to IE-1k indicating that these accessions contain Pi-ta R alleles. Four accessions were susceptible to IB-49 suggesting that components were not intact in Pi-ta-mediated resistance. In contrast, 14 accessions with the susceptible FNP were resistant to IB-49 suggesting these 14 accessions may contain Pi-ta independent new R genes. Together, 83 accessions were identified to contain new R gene to IE-1k. These accessions were genetically distinct determined by simple sequence repeat markers.

The aim of this study is to verify whether an association exists between dietary patterns and LDL-PPD. METHODS: A total of 635 participants aged between 18 and 55 years were included in this cross-sectional study. Nutritional information was collected with a validated food frequency questionnaire. To establish dietary patterns, factor analysis was performed, which led to characterization of the Western and Prudent dietary patterns. Nondenaturing 2%-16% polyacrylamide gradient gel electrophoresis was used to characterize LDL-PPD. RESULTS: The Western pattern was characterized by high consumption of food such as refined grains, French fries, and red meats, and the Prudent pattern by nonhydrogenated fat, vegetables, eggs, and fish. For the Western profile, a negative correlation was found between score value and LDL-PPD before (r = -0.082, p = 0.039) and after adjustment for age (r = -0.080, p = 0.043). A negative correlation between scores for the Prudent profile and the LDL-PPD adjusted for age, sex, plasma triglycerides, and energy was observed (r = -0.12204, p = 0.0021). After division by tertiles and adjustment for the confounding effects of age, sex, plasma triglyceride levels, and energy, a significant difference (p = 0.0015) in LDL-PPD was noted between the highest tertile (255.21 ± 3.61 Å) and the lowest tertile (255.79 ± 3.68 Å) of the Prudent pattern. CONCLUSIONS: Dietary patterns, such as the Western and the Prudent, are associated with LDL-PPD. Dietary patterns can be used to assess the effects of nutritional habits on health status. 3aFrench fries 3acardiovascular diseases 3across-sectional studies 3aeating habits 3aeggs 3aenergy 3afish 3afood consumption 3afood frequency questionnaires 3ahealth status 3alow density lipoprotein 3apolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis 3ared meat 3arisk factors 3atriacylglycerols 3avegetables 2aAdolescent 2aAdult 2aAnthropometry 2aBody Mass Index 2aCardiovascular Diseasesxetiology 2aCholesterol, HDLxblood 2aCholesterol, LDLxblood 2aCross-Sectional Studies 2aDiet 2aFemale 2aFeeding Behavior. 2aHumans 2aMale 2aMiddle Aged 2aNutritional Physiological Phenomena 2aRisk Factors 2aTriglyceridesxblood 2aVegetables 2aYoung Adult1 aParadis, Ann-Marie1 aGodin, Gaston1 aLamarche, Benoît1 aPérusse, Louis1 aVohl, Marie-Claude0 tJournal of the American College of Nutrition.g2010 Dec., v. 29, no. 6 p.630-637dAmerican College of Nutritionx0731-57247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/07315724.2010.107199023Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02604naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100001800171245006000189300001600249500002400265500001500289520154800304650001101852650001401863650002101877650001601898650001801914650002201932650002401954650001301978650002001991653001602011700001802027700001702045773009202062852000902154856005502163655001202218IND4384785220221120052228.0061029e200611  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438478522DNAL7 a170877502pmid7 a10.1111/j.1745-6584.2006.00192.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMehl, Steffen10aComparison of Local Grid Refinement Methods for MODFLOW  ap. 792-796.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aMany ground water modeling efforts use a finite-difference method to solve the ground water flow equation, and many of these models require a relatively fine-grid discretization to accurately represent the selected process in limited areas of interest. Use of a fine grid over the entire domain can be computationally prohibitive; using a variably spaced grid can lead to cells with a large aspect ratio and refinement in areas where detail is not needed. One solution is to use local-grid refinement (LGR) whereby the grid is only refined in the area of interest. This work reviews some LGR methods and identifies advantages and drawbacks in test cases using MODFLOW-2000. The first test case is two dimensional and heterogeneous; the second is three dimensional and includes interaction with a meandering river. Results include simulations using a uniform fine grid, a variably spaced grid, a traditional method of LGR without feedback, and a new shared node method with feedback. Discrepancies from the solution obtained with the uniform fine grid are investigated. For the models tested, the traditional one-way coupled approaches produced discrepancies in head up to 6.8% and discrepancies in cell-to-cell fluxes up to 7.1%, while the new method has head and cell-to-cell flux discrepancies of 0.089% and 0.14%, respectively. Additional results highlight the accuracy, flexibility, and CPU time trade-off of these methods and demonstrate how the new method can be successfully implemented to model surface water-ground water interactions. 3arivers 3aequations 3agroundwater flow 3amethodology 3asurface water 3ahydrologic models 2aComputer Simulation 2aSoftware 2aWater Movements 0anew methods1 aHill, Mary C.1 aLeake, S.

Predicted maximum yields of 79.9% for gelatin processing were obtained under the conditions of alkali treatment with 1.6N sodium hydroxide for 3.16 days and hot-water extraction at 65 °C for 3.4 h. Amino acid composition and functional properties of shark cartilage gelatin were examined in comparison to two porcine skin gelatins. Shark cartilage gelatin had lower concentration of hydroxyproline than the two porcine skin gelatins. Shark cartilage gelatin showed worse turbidity than the two porcine skin gelatins. Foam formation ability, foam stability, water-holding capacity and gel strength of shark cartilage gelatin were lower than the two porcine gelatins, but fat-binding capacity was higher in the shark cartilage gelatin. 3agel strength 3aIsurus oxyrinchus 3asodium hydroxide 3aturbidity 3acartilage 3ahot water treatment 3aresponse surface methodology 3awater holding capacity 3ayields 3ahydroxyproline 3aamino acid composition 3afoams 3aextraction 3agelatin 3atemperature 3aalkali treatment 3asharks 3aswine 0aoptimization 0askin1 aKwak, K.S.1 aPark, D.C.1 aGu, Y.S.1 aJi, C.I.1 aJang, D.H.1 aLee, Y.B.1 aKim, S.B.0 tFood hydrocolloids.g2004 July, v. 18, no. 4 p.573-579dElsevier Sciencex0268-005X7nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle02526naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002100145245008300166300001800249500002400267520148200291650001301773650002001786650002701806650001801833650001801851650001901869650002401888650001601912650002401928650002101952700002301973773012301996852000902119856004802128655001202176IND4442563020221123022138.0100917e201010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444256302DNAL7 a10.1007/s11746-010-1598-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCeci, Liliana N.10aRelation Between Oxidative Stability and Composition in Argentinian Olive Oils  ap. 1189-1197.  aIncludes references  aThe relation between oxidative stability and composition in 58 virgin olive oils from different cultivars and Argentinian regions was studied over four harvest years. The oxidative stability of the oils was assessed using the OSI index (110 °C, 20 L/h air flow). A multiple linear regression model is proposed using OSI values as the dependent variable (multiple R = 0.933, p = 1 × 10⁻¹⁵), with positive contributions of the independent variables: fatty acid composition [oleic acid/(linoleic acid + linolenic acid), 55.3%, p = 1 × 10⁻¹⁵], total polyphenols (24.1%, p = 1.8 × 10⁻⁹), carotenes (4.8%, p = 6.1 × 10⁻⁵), β-tocopherol (1.9%, 6.0 × 10⁻³) and other compounds (13.9%). Highly significant correlation was observed between oxidative stability indexes estimated by the compositional model and those experimentally determined by Rancimat method (b = 0.981, R = 0.924). Chlorophylls and Δ-5-avenasterol contributions to the model were non-significant when variables related with fatty acids and polyphenols were included. The results suggest that the fatty acid composition and the polyphenol content are the main factors that affect the oxidative stability of olive oils. The proposed model allows the estimation of the oxidative stability in olive oils independently of the cultivar. The model was obtained also taking into account samples that lie out of the international legal limits in some compositional values due to natural variations. 3aair flow 3abeta-tocopherol 3afatty acid composition 3alinear models 3alinoleic acid 3alinolenic acid 3aoxidative stability 3apolyphenols 3aregression analysis 3avirgin olive oil1 aCarelli, Amalia A.0 tjournal of the American Oil Chemists' Society.g2010 Oct., v. 87, no. 10 p.1189-1197dSpringer-Verlagx0003-021X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11746-010-1598-6 7aarticle02805naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002500152245010800177300001600285500002400301520150400325650002001829650002201849650001001871650001501881650001601896650002501912650002701937650001501964650001401979650002801993650002602021650001502047650001902062650001902081650001502100651001002115700002202125700002002147700001802167773011002185852000902295856005502304655001202359IND4449198520221123022248.0110211e201103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444919852DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-2028.2010.01237.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEl-Ghani, Monier Abd10aEnvironmental relationships of aquatic vegetation in the fresh water ecosystem of the Nile Delta, Egypt  ap. 103-118.  aIncludes references  aIn generalized four sectors, 350 stands (water channels) in 50 selected and geo-referenced sites with eighteen environmental factors were surveyed. The total number of recorded species varied from a sector to another: 21 in the northern, nineteen in the middle, seventeen in the western and sixteen in the eastern. New populations of Cyperus papyrus were explored. Vallisneria spiralis, Elodea canadensis and Najas armata were among seven extinct species that were not recorded few decades ago. The floristic composition alteration may be because of the addition of organic matter of plant and animal origin and the discharge of industrial and sewage effluents. Classification and ordination analyses (DCA) resulted in the segregation of seventeen vegetation groups (communities), three of them were repeatedly recorded; namely Phragmites australis-Eichhornia crassipes, Phragmites australis-Myriophyllum spicatum and Potamogeton pectinatus-Myriophyllum spicatum. Phragmites australis-Cyperus papyrus group was a new community spreading in the eastern sector of the Delta. Electric conductivity, Fe, Hg and chemical oxygen demand (COD) showed high significant variation (P < 0.001) among the vegetation groups. Other significant variables were Cl, Ca, NO₃, pH and SO₄ (P < 0.047). Redundancy analysis (RDA) was chosen as the appropriate ordination method to perform direct gradient analysis. Trace elements Cu, Fe, Hg and Pb participated in the floristic and chemical composition of each sector. 3aCyperus papyrus 3aElodea canadensis 3aNajas 3aPhragmites 3aPotamogeton 3aVallisneria spiralis 3achemical oxygen demand 3aecosystems 3aeffluents 3aelectrical conductivity 3aenvironmental factors 3afreshwater 3aorganic matter 3atrace elements 3avegetation 3aEgypt1 aEl-Fiky, Abdel M.1 aSoliman, Ashraf1 aKhattab, Adel0 tAfrican journal of ecology.g2011 Mar., v. 49, no. 1 p.103-118dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0141-67077nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2028.2010.01237.x 7aarticle03101naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001300164245010300177300001600280500002400296520145500320650001401775650001001789650001101799650002601810650001401836650001701850650003001867650001201897650001001909650001001919650000901929650005401938650005301992650004002045650001102085650001602096650003902112650005902151650004402210650003302254651001002287700001902297700001802316700001702334700002102351773010502372852000902477856008502486655001202571IND4417028720221123005433.0090228s2009    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441702872DNAL7 a184279472pmid7 a10.1007/s11033-008-9249-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHe, Qian14aThe correlations between HPV16 infection and expressions of c-erbB-2 and bcl-2 in breast carcinoma  ap. 807-812.  aIncludes references  aBreast carcinoma (BC) is a prevalent malignant tumour occurring in women. Many studies have indicated the role of human papilloma virus type 16 (HPV16) in the pathogenesis of BC; however, the correlations of HPV16 infection with the clinicopathologic features of BC and the expressions of c-erbB-2 and bcl-2 have not yet been elucidated. In this study, HPV16 was detected by amplifying the HPV16 E6 gene by the polymerase chain reaction method, and the expressions of c-erbB-2 and bcl-2 in 40 BCs and 20 normal breast tissue samples, obtained from Shaanxi Province, were examined using the streptavidin-peroxidase method with monoclonal antibodies specific to c-erbB-2 and bcl-2. The infection rate of HPV16 E6 and the positive expression rate of c-erbB-2 were significantly higher in the BCs than in the normal tissues (HPV16 E6: 60% vs. 5%; c-erbB-2: 42.5% vs. 5%, P < 0.05). However, the positive expression rate of bcl-2 was significantly lower in the BCs than in the normal tissues (67.5% vs. 95%, P < 0.05). The infection rate of HPV16 did not correlate with any of the pathological features observed (P > 0.05). HPV16 infection correlated with bcl-2 expression (P = 0.015) but not with c-erbB-2 expression (P = 0.747) in the BCs. Interestingly, HPV16 infection correlated with bcl-2 expression in grade I BCs (P = 0.018) but not in grade II-III BCs (P = 0.633). Our data suggest that HPV16 infection is correlated with bcl-2 expression in BCs. 3acarcinoma 3agenes 3ahumans 3amonoclonal antibodies 3apapilloma 3apathogenesis 3apolymerase chain reaction 3aviruses 3awomen 2aAdult 2aAged 2aBreast Neoplasmsxgeneticsxmetabolismxvirology. 2aGene Expression Regulation, Neoplasticxgenetics 2aHuman papillomavirus 16xphysiology 2aHumans 2aMiddle Aged 2aOncogene Proteins, Viralxgenetics 2aProto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2xgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aReceptor, ErbB-2xgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aRepressor Proteinsxgenetics 3aChina1 aZhang, Shu-Qun1 aChu, Yong-Lie1 aJia, Xiao-Li1 aWang, Xiang-Ling0 tMolecular biology reports.g2009 Apr., v. 36, no. 4 p.807-812dSpringer Netherlandsx0301-48517nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11033-008-9249-93Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03533naa a2200637 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001600164245008500180300001600265500002400281500001500305520161400320650004001934650002801974650001802002650001302020650001102033650002002044650000902064650001102073650001702084650002002101650001502121650001302136650001702149650002302166650002202189650002102211650003102232650004202263650002802305650004802333650001602381650002702397650001502424650001702439650003702456650004802493653002102541700001902562700001302581700001802594700001702612700001902629700001802648700001802666773010502684852000902789856008502798655001202883IND4417028820221123005248.0090228s2009    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441702882DNAL7 a185238662pmid7 a10.1007/s11033-008-9250-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Zhanji10aProteomic analysis of early germs with high-oil and normal inbred lines in maize  ap. 813-821.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-05  aHigh-oil maize as a product of long-term selection provides a unique resource for functional genomics. In this study, the abundant soluble proteins of early developing germs from high-oil and normal lines of maize were compared using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DGE) in combination with mass spectrometry (MS). More than 1100 protein spots were detected on electrophoresis maps of both high-oil and normal lines by using silver staining method. A total of 83 protein spots showed significant differential expression (>two-fold change; t-test: P < 0.05) between high-oil and normal inbred lines. Twenty-seven protein spots including 25 non-redundant proteins were identified by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS). Functional categorization of these proteins was carbohydrate metabolism, cytoskeleton, protein metabolism, stress response, and lipid metabolism. Three such proteins involved in lipid metabolism, namely putative enoyl-ACP reductase (ENR), putative stearoyl-ACP desaturase (SAD) and putative acetyl-CoA C-acyltransferase (ACA), had more abundant expressions in high-oil lines than in normal. At the mRNA expression level, SAD, ENR and ACA were expressed at significantly higher levels in high-oil lines than in normal. The results demonstrated that high expressions of SAD, ENR and ACA might be associated to increasing oil concentration in high-oil maize. This study represents the first proteomic analysis of high-oil maize and contributes to a better understanding of the molecular basis of oil accumulation in high-oil maize. 3atwo-dimensional gel electrophoresis 3acarbohydrate metabolism 3amessenger RNA 3aproteins 3at-test 3astress response 3acorn 3asilver 3acytoskeleton 3agene expression 3aproteomics 3agenomics 3ainbred lines 3aprotein metabolism 3amass spectrometry 3alipid metabolism 3agene expression regulation 2aElectrophoresis, Gel, Two-Dimensional 2aFatty Acidsxmetabolism 2aGene Expression Regulation, Plantxgenetics 2aGermination 2aPlant Oilsxmetabolism 2aProteomics 2aTime Factors 2aTranscription, Geneticxgenetics 2aZea maysxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 0aStudent's t-test1 aYang, Xiaohong1 aFu, Yang1 aZhang, Yirong1 aYan, Jianbin1 aSong, Tongming1 aRocheford, T.1 aLi, Jiansheng0 tMolecular biology reports.g2009 Apr., v. 36, no. 4 p.813-821dSpringer Netherlandsx0301-48517nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11033-008-9250-33Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03153naa a2200865 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002800110040001800138100002000156245010400176300001600280500001500296520073000311650002101041650001101062650001401073650002201087650002001109650002501129650001001154650002501164650001601189650001201205650001801217650001801235650002601253650002201279650002501301650002001326650002201346650002101368650002001389650002801409650001401437650003001451650003601481650002401517650001701541653001201558653001701570653001901587653001901606653001901625653001901644653001901663653002801682653001901710653001901729653001901748653001901767653001901786653001401805653001901819653001901838653002101857653001901878653001901897653001001916653001901926653001901945653001901964653001901983700001602002773008802018852000902106856007802115930003302193945001302226946001302239990002302252655001202275IND2199625620221122233410.0990708e199812  nyu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND219962562DNAL7 a98474192pmid7 a10.1007/PL000064362doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOakenfull, E.A.10aPhylogenetic relationships within the genus Equus and the evolution of alpha and theta globin genes  ap. 772-783.  a2019-12-04  aSequences of the alpha1, alpha2 and theta globin genes from six equid species have been determined to investigate relationships within the genus Equus. Analyses using standard phylogenetic methods, or an approach designed to account for the effects of gene conversion between the alpha genes, gave broadly similar results and show that the horses diverged from the zebra/ass ancestor approximately 2.4 million years ago and that the zebra and ass species arose in a rapid radiation approximately 0.9 million years ago. These results from the alpha genes are corroborated by theta gene data and are in contrast to mitochondrial DNA studies of the phylogeny of this genus, which suggest a more gradual set of speciation events. 3astructural genes 3ahorses 3aphylogeny 3aEquus przewalskii 3agene conversion 3aamino acid sequences 3aasses 3anucleotide sequences 3aEquus zebra 2aAnimals 2aBase Sequence 2aDNAxgenetics 2aDNA Primersxgenetics 2aEquidaexgenetics 2aEvolution, Molecular 2aGene Conversion 2aGlobinsxgenetics 2aHorsesxgenetics 2aModels, Genetic 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPhylogeny 2aPolymerase Chain Reaction 2aSequence Homology, Nucleic Acid 2aSpecies Specificity 2aTime Factors 0aglobins 0aequus grevyi 0agenbank/u70192 0agenbank/u69895 0agenbank/u70197 0agenbank/u70204 0agenbank/u70194 0amolecular sequence data 0agenbank/u69896 0agenbank/u70199 0agenbank/u70196 0agenbank/u70193 0aequus hemionus 0aevolution 0agenbank/u70202 0agenbank/u70195 0aequus burchellii 0agenbank/u70201 0agenbank/u70198 0aEquus 0agenbank/u69894 0agenbank/u70203 0agenbank/u70200 0agenbank/u701911 aClegg, J.B.0 tJournal of molecular evolution.g1998 Dec., v. 47, no. 6 p.772-783x0022-28447nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/PL000064363Available from publisher's Web site  a19990901b19990909c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US  mNon-PubAg articles 7aarticle01783naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002100145245004700166300001600213500002400229500001500253520062600268650001600894650003500910650001900945650002300964650004100987650002301028650002801051650001701079653003201096700002201128700002101150700001901171773012501190852000901315856008501324655001201409IND4418036420221122223134.0090320s2009    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441803642DNAL7 a10.1134/S00036838090200332doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMarkosyan, A.

The mutant strains possessed defects in genes MTH1 and MTH2 which resulted in the inability to assimilate methanol as a sole carbon source and the increased activity of alcohol oxidase (AO). The function of the AUG2 gene encoding one of the subunits of AO and CTA1, a probable homolog of peroxisomal catalase of Saccharomyces cereviseae, was investigated by analyses of the molecular forms of isoenzymes. It was shown that optimal conditions for the expression of the AUG2 gene on a medium supplemented with 3% of methanol leads to an increasing synthesis of peroxisomal catalase. The mutant mth1 possessed a dominant formation of AO isoform with electrophoretic mobility which is typical for isogenic form 9, the product of the AUG2 gene, and a decreased level of peroxisomal catalase. The restoration of growth of four spontaneous revertants of the mutant mth1 (Rmth1) on the methanol containing medium was accompanied by an increase in activity of AO isogenic form 9 and peroxisomal catalase. The obtained results confirmed the functional continuity of the structural gene AUG2 in mutant mth1. The correlation of activity of peroxisomal catalase and AO isogenic form 1 in different conditions evidenced the existence of common regulatory elements for genes AUG2 and CTA1 in methilotrophic yeast Pichia methanolica. 3aPichia 3aSaccharomyces 3aalcohol oxidase 3acarbon 3acatalase 3amethanol 3amutants 3astructural genes 3ayeasts1 aKurales, Yu.

In the presence of oxygen, only Methyl Red underwent decomposition, while under oxygen-free conditions, all remaining substances were fully decolourised under the action of a methanogenous consortium of microorganisms. The products of reduction of the azo bond are determined in the case of each dye. Introduction of additional acceptors of electrons (sulfate and nitrate) had a negative influence on the discoloration of azo dyes. Addition of ethanol as an available organic cosubstrate accelerated decomposition of azo dyes both under methanogenous and sulfate- and nitrate-reducing conditions. There is no direct correlation between the rates of conversion of azo dyes under anaerobic conditions or their toxicity to acetoclastic methanogens. Changes in the morphological composition of the community decolouring an azo dye depended on the duration of its impact on microorganisms. The mechanism of the reduction of the azo bond under the action of substances acting as mediators is explained. These substances are products of the metabolism of the microbial community in anaerobic conditions. It is shown that the supposed mediators NADH and sulfide efficiently decolourise azo dyes in a cell-free system, while riboflavin significantly increased the rate of conversion of substrates in recurrent cycles of discoloration only in the presence of an anaerobic microbial consortium. 3aNAD (coenzyme) 3aaerobic conditions 3aanaerobic conditions 3aazo dyes 3acell free system 3acommunity structure 3adiscoloration 3aelectrons 3aethanol 3ametabolism 3amethanogens 3amicrobial communities 3anitrates 3aoxygen 3ariboflavin 3atoxicity1 aKotova, I.

This "green lineage" is phylogenetically subdivided into two distinct assemblages, the Chlorophyta and the Streptophyta. The Chlorophyta includes the Chlorophyceae, Trehouxiophyceae, Ulvophyceae, and Prasinopohyceae, whereas the Streptophyta includes the Charophyceae plus the bryophytes, ferns, and all other multicellular land plants (Embryophyta). The Prasinophyceae is believed to contain the earliest divergences within the green lineage. Phylogenetic analyses using rDNA sequences identify the prasinophytes as a paraphyletic taxon that diverges at the base of the Chlorophyta. rDNA analyses, however, provide ambiguous results regarding the identity of the flagellate ancestor of the Streptophyta. We have sequenced the actin-encoding cDNAs from Scherffelia dubia (Prasinophyceae). Coleochaete scutata, Spirogyra sp. (Charophyceae), and the single-copy actin gene from Mesostigma viride (Prasinophyceae). Phylogenetic analyses show Mesostigma to be the earliest divergence within the Streptophyta and provide direct evidence for a scaly, biflagellate, unicellular ancestor for this lineage. This result is supported by the existence of two conserved actin-coding region introns (positions 20-3,152-1), and one intron in the 5'-untranslated region of the actin gene shared by Mesostigma and the embryo-phytes. 3aSpirogyra 3astructural genes 3acomplementary DNA 3aalgae 3aphylogeny 3aChlorophyta 3aamino acid sequences 3aactin 3aintrons 2aActinsxgenetics 2aBase Sequence 2aChlorophytaxgenetics 2aDNA Primers 2aDNA, Complementary 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPhylogeny 0agenbank/af061019 0aChlorophycota 0acoleochaete scutata 0agenbank/af061021 0agenbank/af061018 0amolecular sequence data 0ascherffelia dubia 0aalgae and seaweeds 0anucleotide sequences 0aCharophyta 0agenbank/af0610201 aWeber, K.1 aAn, S.S.1 aBerning-Koch, W.0 tJournal of molecular evolution.g1998 Nov., v. 47, no. 5 p.544-550x0022-28447nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/PL000064103Available from publisher's Web site  a19990702b19990709c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US  mNon-PubAg articles 7aarticle02471naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002100145245006600166300001600232520107000248650002101318650002501339650002101364650002501385650001101410650001701421650003101438650001001469650003001479650001601509650002801525650001201553650002001565650002401585650002901609650001401638653002201652653000801674653000901682653000901691700002401700773012701724852000901851856008501860930003301945946001101978655001201989IND4418730420221122102550.0090403e200905  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441873042DNAL7 a10.1007/s10658-008-9397-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShi, Xiang-Yang 10aIdentification of hrpL up-regulated genes of Dickeya dadantii  ap. 105-116.  aDickeya dadantii (Erwinia chrysanthemi) is a Gram-negative plant pathogen that invades a wide range of plant species to cause diseases. Hypersensitive response and pathogenicity genes (hrp) are important virulence factors in D. dadantii. However, few hrpL up-regulated genes of D. dadantii have been reported. In this study, a green fluorescence protein (GFP)-based Escherichia coli promoter-probe system was used to identify hrpL up-regulated genes in D. dadantii 3937. From approximate 20,000 library clones screened, hrpA, hrpK, dspE, yijC (a DNA-binding transcriptional regulatory protein) and yecF (unknown function) were identified to be up-regulated by hrpL in D. dadantii 3937. Expression pattern fluorescence of five genes was observed in the wild-type strain and a hrpL deletion mutant strain of D. dadantii 3937 in hrp-inducing minimal medium. Mutants with hrpA, hrpK, dspE, yijC, and yecF genes mutated, respectively, were confirmed, and most of the mutants showed virulence reduction when infecting the plant host African violet (Saintpaulia ionantha). 3aDickeya dadantii 3aErwinia chrysanthemi 3aEscherichia coli 3aSaintpaulia ionantha 3aclones 3afluorescence 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3agreen fluorescent protein 3ahost plants 3ahypersensitive response 3amutants 3aplant pathogens 3aregulatory proteins 3atranscription (genetics) 3avirulence 0aEffector proteins 0ahrp 0ayecF 0ayijC1 aCooksey, Donald A. 0 tEuropean journal of plant pathology.g2009 May, v. 124, no. 1 p.105-116dDordrecht : Springer Netherlandsx0929-18737nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10658-008-9397-83Available from publisher's Web site  a20090404b20090508c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03197naa a2200625 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002800110040001800138100001400156245012100170300001400291500001500305520140100320650002701721650002201748650002201770650000901792650001901801650001201820650001401832650002201846650001501868650002001883650001201903650001201915650001801927650003601945650003901981650002502020650002202045650001402067650003702081650002802118650001402146650002702160651001102187651001102198653000902209653002502218700001502243700001702258700001502275700001402290773008602304852000902390856007802399930003302477945001302510946001302523990002302536655001202559IND2196514220221122054339.0990119e199807  nyu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND219651422DNAL7 a96646952pmid7 a10.1007/PL000063612doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aViard, F.10aVariation of microsatellite size homoplasy across electromorphs, loci, and populations in three invertebrate species  ap. 42-51.  a2019-12-04  aSize homoplasy was analyzed at microsatellite loci by sequencing electromorphs, that is, variants of the same size (base pairs). This study was conducted using five interrupted and/or compound loci in three invertebrate species, the honey bee Apis mellifera, the bumble bee Bombus terrestris, and the freshwater snail Bulinus truncatus. The 15 electromorphs sequenced turned out to hide 31 alleles (i.e., variants identical in sequence). Variation in the amount of size homoplasy was detected among electromorphs and loci. From one to seven alleles were detected per electromorph, and one locus did not show any size homoplasy in both bee species. The amount of size homoplasy was related to the sequencing effort, since the number of alleles was correlated with the number of copies of electromorphs sequenced, but also with the molecular structure of the core sequence at each locus. Size homoplasy within populations was detected only three times, meaning that size homoplasy was detected mostly among populations. We analyzed population structure, estimating Fst and a genetic distance, based on either electromorphs or alleles. Whereas little difference was found in A. mellifera, uncovering size homoplasy led to a more marked population structure in B. terrestris and B. truncatus. We also showed in A. mellifera that the detection of size homoplasy may alter phylogenetic reconstructions. 3amicrosatellite repeats 3aBulinus truncatus 3aBombus terrestris 3aloci 3aApis mellifera 3aalleles 3aphylogeny 3agenetic variation 3apopulation 3aelectrophoresis 2aAlleles 2aAnimals 2aBase Sequence 2aBeesxclassificationxgenetics. 2aBulinusxclassificationxgenetics. 2aEvolution, Molecular 2aGenetic Variation 2aGeography 2aMicrosatellite Repeatsxgenetics 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPhylogeny 2aSequence Analysis, DNA 3aAfrica 3aEurope 0asize 0anucleotide sequences1 aFranck, P.1 aDubois, M.P.1 aEstoup, A.1 aJarne, P.0 tJournal of molecular evolution.g1998 July, v. 47, no. 1 p.42-51x0022-28447nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/PL000063613Available from publisher's Web site  a19990301b19990308c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US  mNon-PubAg articles 7aarticle02918naa a2200673 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002000164245008500184300001600269500002400285520090900309650001001218650001301228650002301241650001701264650001101281650001801292650001001310650001801320650001301338650001301351650003001364650002101394650002801415650002201443650002601465650001201491650002701503650001801530650002101548650001901569650001301588650002801601650003001629650002601659650004901685650004001734650003401774650003201808650002201840650003801862700001501900700001801915700001901933700001401952700001801966700001501984700001601999700001902015773010402034852000902138856008502147655001202232IND4418709020221122034422.0090403s2009    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441870902DNAL7 a184464452pmid7 a10.1007/s11033-008-9260-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Liangzhi14aThe novel 5bp deletion polymorphism in the promoter region of bovine ACRP30 gene  ap. 895-899.  aIncludes references  aACRP30 gene was located nearby the QTL affecting the marbling, ribeye muscle area and fat thickness on the BAT1 in Angus.

  1 aBradford, Barry J.10aPhlorizin Administration Does Not Attenuate Hypophagia Induced by Intraruminal Propionate Infusion in Lactating Dairy Cattle  ap. 326-330.  a2019-12-05  aInfusion data from ruminants has shown that propionate stimulates satiety and decreases meal size, possibly because of increased propionate oxidation in the liver. In this experiment, phlorizin was used to increase glucose demand, which was expected to decrease propionate oxidation and attenuate the decrease in dry matter intake (DMI) caused by propionate infusion. Twelve multiparous, ruminally-cannulated Holstein cows (49 ± 33 d in milk, 40 ± 7 kg/d milk; mean ± SD) were randomly assigned to square and treatment sequence in a replicated 4 x 4 Latin square experiment with a 2 x 2 factorial arrangement of treatments. Treatments were subcutaneous injection of phlorizin or propylene glycol in combination with intraruminal infusion of either Na acetate or Na propionate. Following a 7-d adaptation period, phlorizin (4 g/d) and control injections were administered every 6 h for 7 d. During the final 2 d of injections, Na acetate or Na propionate solutions (1 mol/L, pH 6.0) were infused continuously at the rate of 0.80 L/h. Feeding behavior data were collected during the final 2 d of treatment. Phlorizin caused urinary excretion of 400 ± 40 g glucose/d across infusion treatments. Phlorizin tended to increase plasma free fatty acid and β-hydroxybutyrate concentrations to a greater extent with Na acetate compared to Na propionate infusion (both interactions P < 0.15). Phlorizin decreased and Na propionate increased plasma insulin and glucose concentrations. Infusion of Na propionate decreased DMI (18.4 vs. 21.1 ± 1.4 kg/d, P < 0.001) through an increase in intermeal interval (89.2 vs. 77.3 ± 6.6 min, P = 0.03), resulting in fewer meals per day (11.6 vs. 13.7 ± 0.7, P < 0.001). Phlorizin did not alter DMI (P = 0.39) or measures of feeding behavior, nor were there interactions with infusion type. Increasing glucose demand does not limit the extent to which propionate decreases DMI in lactating dairy cows. 3adairy cows 3acow feeding 3aundereating 3arumen 3a3-hydroxybutyric acid 3aliver 3aglucose 3afree fatty acids 3amedicated feeds 3apropylene glycol 3asodium acetate 3asodium propionate 3ablood glucose 3afeed intake 3aoxidation 3aintraruminal administration 3ainsulin 3aexcretion 2aAnimal Feed 2aAnimals 2aCattle 2aDietxveterinary 2aFeeding Behaviorxdrug effectsxphysiology. 2aFemale 2aLactationxphysiology 2aPhlorhizinxpharmacology 2aPropionatesxadministration & dosagexpharmacology. 2aRumenxmetabolism 2aSodium Acetatexadministration & dosage 0ablood chemistry 0aphlorizin1 aAllen, Michael S.0 tJournal of nutrition.g2007 Feb., v. 137, no. 2 p.326-330dThe American Society for Nutritionx0022-31667nnas  aDNAL  a20070509b20070602c00000000  aINDd2CTe2007/04/11  aOther US 7aarticle03170naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100001600154245010400170300001600274500018200290520170500472650001502177650001502192650001402207650002102221650002502242650001402267650001402281650001902295650000702314650001502321650001402336650002202350650001202372650001302384650000902397650001202406651001202418700001802430700001302448700001502461700001502476773014502491856005502636852000902691655001202700IND60593157220221121063142.0180424e20181125xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059315722DNAL7 a10.17660/ActaHortic.2017.1184.192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZouahri, A.10aCharacterization of soils used for saffron production in the main saffron producing zone in Morocco  ap. 131-136.  aPaper presented at the V International Symposium on Saffron Biology and Technology: Advances in Biology, Technologies, Uses and Market held November 23-26, 2016, Agadir, Morocco  aMoroccan local products or 'terroirs' arouse a real passion in recent years, both nationally and internationally. Among these products appears a very diverse set of aromatic and medicinal plants with specially saffron. Our interest in studying this crop comes from its economic importance since saffron spice is a noble and rare and is considered the most expensive spice in the world. Saffron cultivation in Morocco is located in the regions of Taliouine and Tazhnakht in the mountainous area of the Moroccan Atlas at the joining of the High Atlas and the Anti-Atlas mountain ranges. This crop has been practiced for centuries and is one of the specificities of the territory of this region. This valuable product has many medicinal properties. The study carried out in this work falls within the framework of a research program conducted at INRA and which aims to study the impact of the environment on the qualitative and quantitative yield of saffron in the southern region of Morocco. In fact, several physico-chemical parameters have been determined for different types of soils collected from different saffron sites in the Taliouine region. To do this, 33 sites were sampled and characterized by determining pH, organic matter, phosphorus, potassium, exchange capacity, texture, salinity, and total limestone. The study showed that soils used for saffron have a loamy fine texture with an alkaline pH that promotes the culture of saffron. Relatively high levels of organic matter explain the high adsorbent power of nutrients in the soil under saffron, particularly phosphorus and potassium. Regarding salinity, soils belong to the non-saline soil class which is suitable for growing saffron. 3aadsorbents 3acrop yield 3alimestone 3amedicinal plants 3amedicinal properties 3amountains 3anutrients 3aorganic matter 3apH 3aphosphorus 3apotassium 3aresearch programs 3asaffron 3asalinity 3asoil 3atexture 3aMorocco1 aEl Madani, N.1 aLage, M.1 aDouaik, A.1 aAlilou, H.0 tActa horticulturae.g2017 Nov. 25, , no. 1184 p.131-136dInternational Society for Horticultural Science.wJournal:jnl46289x0567-75727nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.17660/ActaHortic.2017.1184.19  aDNAL 7aarticle01911naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002400145245010300169300001600272520062500288650002700913650001700940650002800957650001800985650001401003650002101017650002001038650001401058653002101072653001601093653002201109700002201131700002301153700002501176700002501201773013701226852000901363856008501372930003301457946001101490655001201501IND4396290820221121041826.0071021e200702  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439629082DNAL7 a10.1007/s11274-006-9214-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGeorgiev, Milen I. 10aElicitation of rosmarinic acid by Lavandula vera MM cell suspension culture with abiotic elicitors  ap. 301-304.  aThe growth of Lavandula vera MM plant cell suspension culture and rosmarinic acid biosynthesis under elicitation with benzothiadiazole and methyl jasmonate were investigated.

The protein content of buckwheat globulin (BWG) was over 90%. Anion-exchange chromatography (with stepwise salt gradient elution) was used to obtain two fractions of BWG, corresponding to the basic and acidic polypeptides, respectively, at a ratio of approximately 1:2. Sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis showed that the acidic and basic polypeptides were linked by disulfide bonds. The basic polypeptide has an estimated molecular weight of 23-25 kDa, an isoelectric point in slightly alkaline region (pH 8-9), and showed a high degree of homology with other legumin-like proteins. Disulfide and sulfhydryl contents in BWG were estimated as 36.4 and 3.20 μM/g of protein, respectively. BWG exhibited beneficial functional properties such as high solubility, emulsifying activity and emulsion stability, while the foaming properties were relatively poor. BWG had lower water holding capacity and comparable fat binding capacity when compared to a commercial soy protein product. 3apolypeptides 3adisulfide bonds 3aseed extracts 3awheat protein 3afoaming capacity 3aabsorption 3aisoelectric point 3awater holding capacity 3aFagopyrum esculentum 3alipids 3asulfhydryl groups 3aextraction 3aemulsifying properties 3asolubility 3amolecular weight 3aglobulins 3abuckwheat 0apurification 0aphysicochemical properties1 aMa, C.Y.0 tFood research international.g2006 Nov., v. 39, no. 9 p.974-981dPublished on behalf of the Canadian Institute of Food Science and Technology by Elsevier Applied Sciencex0963-99697nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodres.2006.06.0043electronic resource  a20061121b20061202c00000000  aINDdPNNe2006/11/21  aNon-US 7aarticle02425naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131072000900149100001600158245011300174300001700287500002400304500001500328520089600343650002001239650001201259650001801271650002301289650003701312650001201349650000901361650003101370650001501401650001901416650001101435650002701446650001701473650001401490650001801504653002701522700002201549700001701571773019201588852000901780856007301789930003301862945002501895946001101920655001201931IND4383930220221121041938.0060928e200611  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438393022DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodres.2006.07.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ5061 aBinsi, P.K.10aSome physico-chemical, functional and rheological properties of actomyosin from green mussel (Perna viridis)  ap. 992-1001.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThe physico-chemical and rheological properties of fresh actomyosin from green mussel (Perna viridis) have been evaluated. Amino acid profile of actomyosin revealed a relatively high proportion of glutamic acid, alanine, tryptophan and aspartic acid. Ultraviolet absorption spectra of actomyosin solution showed a maximum absorbance in the wavelength region of 270-280 nm indicating presence of aromatic amino acid residues. Dynamic viscoelastic behavior of actomyosin revealed the ability to form network during heating, however, the strength of network appeared to be weak as given by frequency sweep of the heat set gel. The flow behavior of actomyosin solution indicated pseudoplastic behavior at different concentrations and temperatures. Casson and Herschel-Bulkley models were used to evaluate flow behavior of actomyosin and revealed maximum yield stress value at 30 mg/ml at 40 °C. 3aviscoelasticity 3amussels 3aaspartic acid 3aaromatic compounds 3aultraviolet-visible spectroscopy 3aalanine 3aflow 3aphysicochemical properties 3atryptophan 3athermodynamics 3amyosin 3aamino acid composition 3ahealth foods 3ashellfish 3aglutamic acid 0arheological properties1 aShamasundar, B.A.1 aDileep, A.O.0 tFood research international.g2006 Nov., v. 39, no. 9 p.992-1001dPublished on behalf of the Canadian Institute of Food Science and Technology by Elsevier Applied Sciencex0963-99697nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodres.2006.07.0083electronic resource  a20061121b20061202c00000000  aINDdPNNe2006/11/21  aNon-US 7aarticle03404naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003400111040001800145100002000163245012400183300001600307500002400323520144400347650002001791650002701811650000801838650001701846650004401863650002301907650001001930650001001940650001501950650002501965650001301990650001502003650004702018650006302065650007002128650001702198650002502215650001602240650004102256650002202297650004902319650001102368650001402379650003902393650005602432650002702488650002402515700002102539700002102560700001902581700001902600773009002619852000902709856008402718655001202802IND4418431720221121021838.0090330s2009    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441843172DNAL7 a192695662pmid7 a10.1016/j.fm.2008.12.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aManzano, Marisa10aMolecular methods to evaluate biodiversity in Bacillus cereus and Bacillus thuringiensis strains from different origins  ap. 259-264.  aIncludes references  aThe spore-forming genus Bacillus includes species of industrial, clinical and environmental significance. The possibility of differentiating between Bacillus cereus and Bacillus thuringiensis, toxin producers associated with illness, is a real need in monitoring potentially contaminated foods to understand the real distribution of B. cereus/B. thuringiensis in different outbreak cases. As the use of DNA comparison obtains clearer results than classical microbiological methods in distinguishing B. cereus from B. thuringiensis in this work PCR-TTGE (Temporal Temperature Gradient gel Electrophoresis), rep-PCR and RAPD-PCR methods have been compared to assess the intra- and inter-specific variability of B. cereus and B. thuringiensis. 80 strains of B. cereus and B. thuringiensis isolated from food, patients and pesticides were analyzed using a gyrB gene DNA sequence in TTGE; primer M13 in the RAPD-PCR and primers REP1DT and REP2DT in the rep-PCR methods. A widespread distribution of the electrophoretic profiles was obtained either for B. cereus or for B. thuringiensis using TTGE. rep-PCR and RAPD-PCR were not always able to group strains from the same origin or belonging to the same species. The fingerprints obtained with the rep- and RAPD-PCR methods confirm the high intraspecific variability present in B. cereus and B. thuringiensis indicating the difficulty to discriminate between these two species in outbreak cases. 3aBacillus cereus 3aBacillus thuringiensis 3aDNA 3abiodiversity 3adenaturing gradient gel electrophoresis 3afood contamination 3afoods 3agenes 3amonitoring 3anucleotide sequences 3apatients 3apesticides 3arandom amplified polymorphic DNA technique 2aBacillus cereusxclassificationxisolation & purification. 2aBacillus thuringiensisxclassificationxisolation & purification. 2aBiodiversity 2aDNA Gyrasexgenetics 2aDNA Primers 2aDNA, Bacterialxchemistryxgenetics. 2aDisease Outbreaks 2aElectrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gelxmethods 2aHumans 2aPhylogeny 2aPolymerase Chain Reactionxmethods 2aRandom Amplified Polymorphic DNA Techniquexmethods 2aSequence Analysis, DNA 2aSpecies Specificity1 aGiusto, Cristina1 aIacumin, Lucilla1 aCantoni, Carlo1 aComi, Giuseppe0 tFood microbiology.g2009 May, v. 26, no. 3 p.259-264dAcademic Pressx0740-00207nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fm.2008.12.0123Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle01313naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001500145245010100160300001600261520027400277650002900551650001100580650002100591650000900612650001400621650001100635653001900646653001900665700001600684773013700700852000900837856008500846930003300931946001100964655001200975IND4397162720221121022001.0071028e200606  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439716272DNAL7 a10.1007/s11274-005-9085-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMeena, K. 10aImmobilization of Saccharomyces Cerevisiae Cells by Gel Entrapment Using Various Metal Alginates  ap. 651-653.  aImmobilization of whole yeast cells (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) in calcium alginate is well known.

However, as methods for testing the misuse of heroin, a morphine derivative, often involve bioanalytical methods that cover a number of other illicit drug substances, such methods are also included in the review. Furthermore, the review also includes bioanalysis in a broader perspective as analysis of plant materials, cell cultures and environmental samples. The review is not intended to cover all publications that include bioanalysis of morphine but is more to be considered a view into the current best practices of bioanalysis of morphine, its metabolites and other related substances. 3acell culture 3ametabolites 3amorphine0 tJournal of separation science.g2009 Mar., v. 32, no. 5-6 p.825-834dWiley-VCH Verlagx1615-93067nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jssc.2008006233Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02214naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001400152245006900166300001600235520107000251650002501321650002101346650001301367650001301380650001801393650001701411650000701428650001401435650001601449650002001465700001601485700001601501700001901517700002101536773008901557852000901646856009201655930003301747945001301780946001101793655001201804IND2199009420221121022018.0990529e199901  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND219900942DNAL7 a10.1046/j.1365-2672.1999.00592.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMassa, S.10aNote: susceptibility of chlorine of Aeromonas hydrophila strains  ap. 169-173.  aThe susceptibility of five Aeromonas hydrophila strains and one Escherichia coli strain to chlorine was studied under carefully controlled laboratory conditions. Of the Aer. hydrophila strains, two were from untreated water, two from tap water (immediately downstream of a water treatment plant) and one from the DSM collection. The study included disinfectant concentration (0(.)1, 0(.)2 and 0(.)5 mg l-1), pH (6, 7 and 8) and temperature (4, 21 and 32 degrees C) as controlled variables. The results indicated that the untreated water strains, the DSM strain and the E. coli strain were inactivated within 1 min of chlorine treatment. The strains from chlorinated water (TW11 and TW27) showed a different susceptibility to chlorine disinfection, the rate of inactivation being greater at pH 6 than at pH 8 for both strains. Under the standard conditions of temperature 21 degrees, pH 7 and chlorine concentration 0(.)2 mg l-1, an increase or decrease of approximately 1 log unit in the number of bacteria did not affect the kill rate of the strains TW11 and TW27. 3aAeromonas hydrophila 3aEscherichia coli 3abacteria 3achlorine 3adisinfectants 3adisinfection 3apH 3atap water 3atemperature 3awater treatment1 aArmuzzi, R.1 aTosques, M.1 aCanganella, F.1 aTrovatelli, L.D.0 tJournal of applied microbiology.g1999 Jan., v. 86, no. 1 p.169-173x1364-50727nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-2672.1999.00592.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20060205b00000000c00000000  aINDdGK1  aNon-US 7aarticle05468naa a2201045 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002800111040001800139100001500157245015700172300001600329520226100345650002502606650001502631650001402646650001002660650002502670650002302695650001802718650001602736650003302752650003302785650003502818650001802853650002602871650002902897650003502926650002502961650002802986650003003014650002103044650002803065650002103093650003703114650004503151650001403196650002503210650005403235650003603289650001703325650002403342650002603366650002403392653003203416653002803448653002103476653002103497653002103518653002103539653002103560653002103581653002103602653002103623653002103644653002103665653002103686653002103707653002103728653002103749653002103770653002103791653002103812653002103833653002103854653002103875653002103896653002103917653002103938653002103959653002103980653002104001653002104022653002104043653002104064653002204085700001504107700001604122700001504138773008804153852000904241856007804250930003304328945001304361946001304374990002304387655001204410IND2206397020221121021915.0000814e199911  nyu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220639702DNAL7 a105520442pmid7 a10.1007/PL000065842doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSawada, H.10aPhylogenetic analysis of Pseudomonas syringae pathovars suggests the horizontal gene transfer of argK and the evolutionary stability of hrp gene cluster  ap. 627-644.  aPseudomonas syringae are differentiated into approximately 50 pathovars with different plant pathogenicities and host specificities. To understand its pathogenicity differentiation and the evolutionary mechanisms of pathogenicity-related genes, phylogenetic analyses were conducted using 56 strains belonging to 19 pathovars. gyrB and rpoD were adopted as the index genes to determine the course of bacterial genome evolution, and hrpL and hrpS were selected as the representatives of the pathogenicity-related genes located on the genome (chromosome). Based on these data, NJ, MP, and ML phylogenetic trees were constructed, and thus 3 trees for each gene and 12 gene trees in total were obtained, all of which showed three distinct monophyletic groups: Groups 1, 2 and 3. The observation that the same set of OTUs constitute each group in all four genes suggests that these genes had not experienced any intergroup horizontal gene transfer within P. syringae but have been stable on and evolved along with the P. syringae genome. These four index genes were then compared with another pathogenicity-related gene, argK (the phaseolotoxin-resistant ornithine carbamoyltransferase gene, which exists within the argK-tox gene cluster). All 13 strains of pv. phaseolicola and pv. actinidiae used had been confirmed to produce phaseolotoxin and to have argK, whose sequences were completely identical, without a single synonymous substitution among the strains used (Sawada et al. 1997a). On the other hand, argK were not present on the genomes of the other 43 strains used other than pv. actinidiae and pv. phaseolicola. Thus, the productivity of phaseolotoxin and the possession of the argK gene were shown at only two points on the phylogenetic tree: Group 1 (pv. actinidiae) and Group 3 (pv. phaseolicola). A t test between these two pathovars for the synonymous distances of argK and the tandemly combined sequence of the four index genes showed a high significance, suggesting that the argK gene (or argK-tox gene cluster) experienced horizontal gene transfer and expanded its distribution over two pathovars after the pathovars had separated, thus showing a base substitution pattern extremely different from that of the noncluster region of the genome. 3aPseudomonas syringae 3apathotypes 3aphylogeny 3agenes 3anucleotide sequences 3astrain differences 3apathogenicity 3ahost plants 3aplant diseases and disorders 2aBacterial Proteinsxgenetics 2aBacterial Toxinsxbiosynthesis 2aBase Sequence 2aDNA Primersxgenetics 2aDNA, Bacterialxgenetics 2aDNA-Binding Proteinsxgenetics 2aEvolution, Molecular 2aExotoxinsxbiosynthesis 2aGene Transfer, Horizontal 2aGenes, Bacterial 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aMultigene Family 2aOrnithinexanalogs & derivatives 2aOrnithine Carbamoyltransferasexgenetics 2aPhylogeny 2aPlantsxmicrobiology 2aPseudomonasxgeneticsxmetabolismxpathogenicity. 2aSequence Homology, Nucleic Acid 2aSigma Factor 2aSpecies Specificity 2aTranscription Factors 2aVirulencexgenetics 0apathogenicity related genes 0amolecular sequence data 0agenbank/ab016299 0agenbank/ab016300 0agenbank/ab016301 0agenbank/ab016302 0agenbank/ab016303 0agenbank/ab016304 0agenbank/ab016305 0agenbank/ab016306 0agenbank/ab016307 0agenbank/ab016308 0agenbank/ab016309 0agenbank/ab016310 0agenbank/ab016311 0agenbank/ab016312 0agenbank/ab016313 0agenbank/ab016314 0agenbank/ab016315 0agenbank/ab016316 0agenbank/ab016317 0agenbank/ab016318 0agenbank/ab016319 0agenbank/ab016320 0agenbank/ab016321 0agenbank/ab016322 0agenbank/ab016323 0agenbank/ab016324 0agenbank/ab016325 0agenbank/ab016326 0agenbank/ab016327 0agenbank/ab016328+1 aSuzuki, F.1 aMatsuda, I.1 aSaitou, N.0 tJournal of molecular evolution.g1999 Nov., v. 49, no. 5 p.627-644x0022-28447nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/PL000065843Available from publisher's Web site  a20001002b20001005c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US  mNon-PubAg articles 7aarticle02684naa a2200745 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002800111040001800139100002100157245018900178300001600367500001500383520031400398650002500712650001700737650002100754650001600775650001900791650002000810650001400830650002500844650001800869650001200887650003200899650001800931650002400949650004500973650001801018650004001036650005501076650002501131650001701156650004301173650002801216650001401244650002301258650003401281650003601315653002101351653002101372653002101393653002101414653002801435653002101463653002101484653002101505653002101526653002101547653002501568653002101593700001701614700001901631700001801650773008901668852000901757856007801766930003301844945001301877946001301890990002301903655001201926IND2206538120221121021956.0000821e199909  nyu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220653812DNAL7 a104737712pmid7 a10.1007/PL000065532doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSamigullin, T.K.10aMolecular data from the chloroplast rpoC1 gene suggest a deep and distinct dichotomy of contemporary spermatophytes into two monophyla: gymnosperms (including Gnetales) and angiosperms  ap. 310-315.  a2019-12-04  aPartial sequences of the rpoC1 gene from two species of angiosperms and three species of gymnosperms (8330 base pairs) were determined and compared.

Tsetse flies (Diptera: Glossinidae) harbor three symbiotic organisms in addition to the parasitic African trypanosomes they transmit. Two of these microorganisms reside in different gut cells, while the third organism is harbored in reproductive tissues and belongs to the genus Wolbachia. The primary symbiont (genus Wigglesworthia glossinidia) lives in differentiated epithelial cells (bacteriocytes) which form an organ (bacteriome) in the anterior gut, while the secondary (S) symbionts are present in midgut cells. Here we have characterized the phylogeny of Wigglesworthia based on their 16S rDNA sequence analysis from eight species representing the three subgenera of Glossina: Austenina (= fusca group), Nemorhina (= palpalis group), and Glossina (= morsitans group). Independently, the ribosomal DNA internal transcribed spacer-2 (ITS-2) regions from these species were analyzed. The analysis of Wigglesworthia indicated that they form a distinct lineage in the gamma subdivision of Proteobacteria and display concordance with their host insect species. The trees generated by parsimony confirmed the monophyletic taxonomic placement of Glossina, where fusca group species formed the deepest branch followed by morsitans and palpalis groups, respectively. The placement of the species Glossina austeni by both the traditional morphological and biochemical criteria has been controversial. Results presented here, based on both the ITS-2 and the symbiont 16S rDNA sequence analysis, suggest that Glossina austeni should be placed into a separate fourth subgenus, Machadomyia, which forms a sister-group relationship with the morsitans group species. 3ainterspecific variation 3aGlossina 3aloci 3aribosomal DNA 3asymbionts 3amidgut 3aphylogeny 3ainternal transcribed spacers 3abacteria 0aspecies differences 0agenbank/af021359 0agenbank/af022880 0agenbank/af022876 0agenbank/af021364 0agenbank/af024505 0agenbank/af021353 0agenbank/af021357 0agenbank/af021352 0agenbank/af022362 0amolecular sequence data 0agenbank/af021356 0agenbank/af022875 0agenbank/af022360 0agenbank/af022361 0agenbank/af021363 0agenbank/af021355 0agenbank/af022878 0agenbank/af022879 0agenbank/af021354 0agenbank/af021366 0agenbank/af021358 0agenbank/af021365 0agenbank/af021361 0anucleotide sequences 0agenbank/af021362 0agenbank/af021360 0agenbank/af0228771 aLi, S.1 aAksoy, S.0 tJournal of molecular evolution.g1999 Jan., v. 48, no. 1 p.49-58x0022-28447nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/PL000064443Available from publisher's Web site  a20000404b20000411c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US  mNon-PubAg articles 7aarticle02661naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002300145245013300168300001600301500002400317520151300341650001201854650001001866650001901876650002201895650001301917650001301930650001301943650001401956700002401970700003301994700001902027700002302046700001902069773010502088852000902193856008502202655001202287IND4417027920221121010613.0090228s2009    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441702792DNAL7 a10.1007/s11033-008-9240-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGunel-Ozcan, Aysen14aThe spectrum of FMF mutations and genotypes in the referrals to molecular genetic laboratory at Kırıkkale University in Turkey  ap. 757-760.  aIncludes references  aFamilial Mediterranean Fever (FMF) is an autosomal recessive genetic disorder characterised by recurrent and self-limited abdominal pain, synovitis and pleuritis. MEFV gene mutations are responsible from the disease and its protein product, pyrin or marenostrin, plays an essential role in the regulation of the inflammatory reactions. MEFV gene contains 10 exons and most of the mutations have been found on the last exon. Up to date, 152 mutations and polymorpisms have been reported inwhere V726A, M694V, M694I, M680I and E148Q are the most common mutations. In this study, MEFV allele frequencies of 136 individuals (60 from Pediatry, 76 from Internal Medicine) have been evaluated, and compared with each other. Asymptomatic individuals with FMF family history (4 from Pediatry, 6 from Internal Medicine) were excluded from the analysis. The prominent mutations indicated in the Pediatry group are V726A, M694V and M680I (G/C) and with the allele frequency of 0.06, 0.05 and 0.04 respectively while they were E148Q, M694V, M680I (G/C) in the Internal Medicine group with the allele frequency of 0.12, 0.08 and 0.04. The E148Q mutation is significantly overrepresented in the adult referrals (P = 0.02). Mutation on both alleles was observed in only 12% of cases. Overall mutation frequency was low, seen in 26.2% (66/252). However, when only diagnosed patients were analyzed it is 72.7% (16/22). It is also interesting that 63% of individuals are female that there may be sex influence on FMF phenotype. 3aalleles 3aexons 3agene frequency 3agenetic disorders 3agenotype 3amutation 3apatients 3aphenotype1 aSayın, Derya Beyza1 aMısırlıoğlu, Emine Dibek1 aGüliter, Sefa1 aYakaryilmaz, Fahri1 aEnsari, Cuneyt0 tMolecular biology reports.g2009 Apr., v. 36, no. 4 p.757-760dSpringer Netherlandsx0301-48517nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11033-008-9240-53Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02120naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001900145245007900164300001600243500002400259520110200283650002701385650001801412650002001430650002001450650001601470650001301486650000901499700001401508700001501522700001701537700001701554773010501571852000901676856008501685655001201770IND4417027720221120235936.0090228s2009    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441702772DNAL7 a10.1007/s11033-008-9238-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Xiaofeng12aA rice lipid transfer protein binds to plasma membrane proteinaceous sites  ap. 745-750.  aIncludes references  aNonspecific lipid transfer protein (nsLTP) is usually basic and secreted low-molecular-mass protein in plants. The 3-D structure of nsLTP1 resembles that of elicitin produced by the plant pathogen Phytophthora cryptogea, which can bind to the plant plasma membrane putative receptor and activate the downstream responses. It is inferred that nsLTP1 may have similar binding sites on the plasma membranes. In this work, rice recombinant protein TRX-nsLTP110 labeled with ¹²⁵I was shown to bind to rice plasma membrane preparations in a saturable curve, with an apparent Kd of 13.6 nM and Bmax of 150 fmol/mg proteins. Competition experiments revealed that the binding of TRX-nsLTP110 was specific, in contrast to the nonspecific binding of the fusion tag thioredoxin. Protease treatment assay showed that the binding sites were proteinaceous. Our results suggest that the binding sites of nsLTPs on plasma membranes may be ubiquitous in the plant kingdom. They may be competed out from the binding sites under pathogen attack, supporting a role for nsLTP1 in host defense response to pathogens. 3aPhytophthora cryptogea 3abinding sites 3aplant pathogens 3aplasma membrane 3aproteinases 3aproteins 3arice1 aWang, Hai1 aLi, Yuanli1 aCao, Kaiming1 aGe, Xiaochun0 tMolecular biology reports.g2009 Apr., v. 36, no. 4 p.745-750dSpringer Netherlandsx0301-48517nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11033-008-9238-z3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02732naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001500164245011200179300001600291500002400307520115900331650001201490650002501502650001901527650002501546650002201571650001301593650001601606650001001622650000901632650001601641650001201657650001201669650002801681650001301709650002001722650003601742650003101778651001001809700001401819700001301833700001701846700001601863700001501879700001201894700001301906700001601919700001701935700001501952773010501967852000902072856008502081655001202166IND4417027120221120235924.0090228s2009    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441702712DNAL7 a183575132pmid7 a10.1007/s11033-008-9232-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLan, X.

The PCR-RFLP analysis showed the predominance of TT genotype and the frequencies of allele T varied from 0.757 to 0.976 in the analyzed populations (SBWC, Bo, XH and HM). Further study, distributions of genotypic and allelic frequencies at this locus were found to be significantly different among populations based on a χ²-test (P < 0.001), suggesting that the breed factor significantly affected the molecular genetic character of POU1F1 gene. The genetic diversity analysis revealed that Chinese indigenous populations had a wide spectrum of genetic diversity in goat POU1F1-AluI locus. However, the ANOVA analysis revealed no significant differences for gene homozygosty, gene heterozygosty, effective allele numbers and PIC (polymorphism information content) among meat, dairy and cashmere utility types (P > 0.05), suggesting that goat utility types had no significant effect on the spectrum of genetic diversity. 3aalleles 3aanalysis of variance 3agene frequency 3agenetic polymorphism 3agenetic variation 3agenotype 3agoat breeds 3agoats 3aloci 3athyrotropin 2aAlleles 2aAnimals 2aAnimals, Wildxgenetics 2aGenotype 2aGoatsxgenetics 2aPolymorphism, Geneticxgenetics 2aTrans-Activatorsxgenetics 0aChina1 aLi, M.

This clone had a size of about 4.2 kb and, after sequencing, was found to contain an RNA-mediated, shorter retrotransposon named L1Bm, which was in turn integrated with a much longer retrotransposon named BMC1. Thus, the mobile elements made a novel tripartite structure. The BMC1 and L1Bm moieties of the composite structure each contained a 63-bp conserved sequence which was subsequently found to be highly conserved in all BMC1 and L1Bm elements registered so far. We propose that the 63-bp stretch may be a recognition site for a retrotransposition mechanism conducted by a reverse transcriptase and an endonuclease complex. On the basis of this inference, we propose a model that predicts how different types of BMC1 and L1Bm elements are dispersed in the genome. In addition, a phylogenetic tree made from the current and extant BMC1 and L1Bm sequences indicated that these elements can be classified into Subfamilies I and II. 3aretrotransposons 3agenome 3aphylogeny 3aBombyx mori 3amutants 3atransposons 2aAnimals 2aBase Sequence 2aBombyxxgenetics 2aCloning, Molecular 2aConserved Sequence 2aDNAxgenetics 2aDNA Primersxgenetics 2aEvolution, Molecular 2aGenes, Insect 2aGenome 2aModels, Genetic 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPhylogeny 2aRetroelementsxgenetics 2aSequence Homology, Nucleic Acid 0agenbank/ab008780 0amolecular sequence data 0adeletions 0anucleotide sequences 0agenbank/ab0087791 aHashido, K.1 aTsuchida, K.1 aTakada, N.1 aShiino, T.1 aMaekawa, H.0 tJournal of molecular evolution.g1999 May, v. 48, no. 5 p.577-585x0022-28447nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/PL000065003Available from publisher's Web site  a20000501b20000508c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US  mNon-PubAg articles 7aarticle02595naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001700145245011200162300001800274520109900292650001501391650002501406650001301431650002601444650001101470650002401481650001401505650002501519650001401544650001401558650004501572650001801617650001401635651002001649653002401669653002701693653002601720700001201746700001401758700001501772700001601787700002001803773014001823852000901963856008501972930003302057946001102090655001202101IND4394019520221120205834.0070812e200709  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439401952DNAL7 a10.1007/s11274-007-9359-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Zhiyong 10a16S rDNA clone library-based bacterial phylogenetic diversity associated with three South China Sea sponges  ap. 1265-1272.  aCulture-independent molecular techniques, 16S rDNA clone library alongside RFLP and phylogenetic analysis, were applied to investigate the bacterial diversity associated with three South China Sea sponges, Stelletta tenui, Halichondria rugosa and Dysidea avara. A wide bacterial diversity was detected according to total genomic DNA-based 16S rDNA clone library, abundant clones with low identify with sequences retrieved from database were found as well as uncultured sponge symbionts. The phylogenetic analysis shows that the bacterial community structure of Stelletta tenui is similar to that of Halichondria rugosa comprising gamma-Proteobacteria and Firmicutes. Whereas, alpha-Proteobacteria, gamma-Protebacteria, Bacteroidetes and uncultured sponge symbionts were found in sponge Dysidea avara, suggesting that Dysidea avara has the highest bacteria diversity among these sponges. A specific sponge-microbe association is suggested based on the difference of bacterial diversity among these three sponges from the same geography location and the observed sponge species-specific bacteria. 3aFirmicutes 3aalpha-Proteobacteria 3abacteria 3abacterial communities 3aclones 3acommunity structure 3adatabases 3agamma-Proteobacteria 3ageography 3aphylogeny 3arestriction fragment length polymorphism 3aribosomal DNA 3asymbionts 3aSouth China Sea 0aBacterial diversity 0a16S rDNA clone library 0aPhylogenetic analysis1 aHu, Ye 1 aLiu, Yan 1 aHuang, Yi 1 aHe, Liming 1 aMiao, Xiaoling 0 tWorld journal of microbiology & biotechnology.g2007 Sept., v. 23, no. 9 p.1265-1272dDordrecht : Springer Netherlandsx0959-39937nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11274-007-9359-x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20070812b20070902c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02758naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002200153245010700175300001400282500018200296520154800478650001902026650001002045650001502055650001002070650001202080650001102092650001102103650001202114650000902126650001102135650001102146650001202157651000902169773014302178856005402321852000902375655001202384IND60593154420221120205816.0180423e20181125xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059315442DNAL7 a10.17660/ActaHortic.2017.1184.52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSabet Temouri, M.10aInvestigation of planting age farm on saffron characteristics and corm position in soil, Kashmar, Iran  ap. 31-38.  aPaper presented at the V International Symposium on Saffron Biology and Technology: Advances in Biology, Technologies, Uses and Market held November 23-26, 2016, Agadir, Morocco  aTo evaluate the morphological characteristics and yield of saffron in the fields with ages over 4 years, we conducted random sampling from 3 fields with 3 ha area. For this purpose, we collected three samples from each of the fields with 4, 7 and 14 years old. Sampling depth was from 35 cm with minimum 5 bunches of plants harvested in each sample. Then the samples were transported to the laboratory in Ferdowsi University of Mashhad and all characteristics were determined and recorded such as leaf dry weight, number of daughter corms plant-1, average weight of corms, corms position in depth, collar length, leaves length, leaves diameter, number of leaves and stigma and flower yield of saffron in the field. Results showed that leaf length, collar length and the number of corms weighing between 1 to 3 g field-1 (from 7 to 14 years old) had significant differences (p≤0.05) compared to the 4-year-old field. Also, the number of leaves and corms weight increased with aging field (from 4 to 7 years) but these criteria decreased significantly (p≤0.01) with increased farm age (from 7 years to 14 years). Studies showed that the flower and stigma yield of the older farm (14 years), was not significant compared to the 7-year-old farm, but these criteria had a significant difference from 4- to 14-years-old farms. It seems to reduce tillage operations and for decreased losses of daughter corms for uses of propagation, and the dry fodder in summer, had no difference between efficiency of oldest farm (14 years) or 7-year-old farm. 3aCrocus sativus 3acorms 3acrop yield 3afarms 3aflowers 3aforage 3aleaves 3asaffron 3asoil 3astigma 3asummer 3atillage 3aIran0 tActa horticulturae.g2017 Nov. 25, , no. 1184 p.31-38dInternational Society for Horticultural Science.wJournal:jnl46289x0567-75727nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.17660/ActaHortic.2017.1184.5  aDNAL 7aarticle03184naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004300092040001800135072000900153072000900162072000900171072000900180100001600189245018400205300001400389500002400403520169400427650001702121650001502138650001602153650001802169650001602187650002202203650001302225650002402238650002002262650001802282650001802300650001702318650003702335651001102372700001702383700001602400700001502416773009202431852000902523856007702532930003302609945002502642946001102667655001202678IND4383955620221120205704.0060929e20060908xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438395562DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aquaculture.2005.12.0222doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL200 0aM310 0aM001 0aM1201 aKolstad, K.10aGenetic variation and genotype by location interaction in body weight, spinal deformity and sexual maturity in Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) reared at different locations off Norway  ap. 66-73.  aIncludes references  aBody weight, spinal deformity and sexual maturity were recorded at 2 years of age and at harvest in 51 full-sib families of Coastal and Arctic cod, Gadus morhua, produced from 40 sires and 34 dams. The family-groups were reared at four locations off the coast of Norway in Hordaland, Møre and Romsdal (M&R), Nordland and Troms. Heritability estimates for body weight (0.64 ± 0.12) at harvest indicate promising potential for improvement by selective breeding. Low and non-significant estimates of heritabilities were found for sexual maturity at harvest. All traits showed a significant interaction effect of family group by location. The genetic correlations between the same traits recorded at the different locations ranged from 0.82 to 0.95 for body weight, and from 0.58 to 0.82 for spinal deformity. The high correlations for body weight indicate no important genotype by environment interaction, while spinal deformity shows a higher degree of environmental sensitivity. This should be taken into account in a breeding program. A high genetic correlation was found between body weight recorded at 2 years of age and at harvest (0.89), while weight recorded at tagging was only moderately correlated to weight at 2 years of age and at harvest (0.54 and 0.48). Weight at 2 years of age may thus be used as a selection criterion for growth in Atlantic cod. The degree of sexual maturity was higher in the Coastal than in the Arctic cod at harvest, while no significant differences were found between Coastal and Arctic cod for body weight and spinal deformity at any location. Consequently, separate breeding programs for the two strains in the breeding population may not be needed. 3aGadus morhua 3acod (fish) 3amarine fish 3aanimal growth 3abody weight 3agenetic variation 3agenotype 3agenetic correlation 3asexual maturity 3abone diseases 3afish diseases 3aheritability 3agenotype-environment interaction 3aNorway1 aThorland, I.1 aRefstie, T.1 aGjerde, B.0 tAquaculture.g2006 Sept. 8, v. 259, no. 1-4 p.66-73dElsevier Pub.

A kanamycin-resistance cassette was inserted at specific restriction sites within a 7 kb genomic fragment of M114 DNA and by marker exchange two siderophore-negative mutants, designated M1 and M2, were isolated. The nucleotide sequence of approximately 4 kb of the region flanking the insertion sites was determined and a large open reading frame (ORF) extending for 2409 bp was identified. This gene was designated pbsC (pseudobactin synthesis C) and its putative protein product termed PbsC. PbsC was found to be homologous to a family of enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites, including EntF of Escherichia coli. These enzymes are believed to act via ATP-dependent binding of AMP to their substrate. Several areas of high sequence homology between these proteins and PbsC were observed, including a conserved AMP-binding domain. The expression of pbsC is iron-regulated as revealed when a DNA fragment containing the upstream region was cloned in a promoter probe vector and conjugated into the wild-type strain, M114. The nucleotide sequence upstream of the putative translational start site contains a region homologous to previously defined -16 to -25 sequences of iron-regulated genes but did not contain an iron-box consensus sequence. It was noted that inactivation of the pbsC gene also affected other iron-regulated phenotypes of Pseudomonas M114. 3aPseudomonas 3asoil bacteria 3astructural genes 3abacterial proteins 3abiosynthesis 3anucleotide sequences 3aamino acid sequences 3agene expression 3airon 3afungal antagonists 3aloci 3atranscription (genetics) 3asiderophores 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aBacterial Proteinsxchemistryxgenetics. 2aBase Sequence 2aConsensus Sequence 2aConserved Sequence 2aCosmids 2aDNA, Fungalxgenetics 2aDNA-Binding Proteins 2aFungal Proteinsxbiosynthesisxchemistryxgenetics. 2aGene Expression Regulation, Fungal 2aGenes, Fungal 2aIronxmetabolism 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aMutagenesis, Insertional 2aOligopeptidesxbiosynthesis 2aOpen Reading Frames 2aPeptide Synthasesxchemistryxgenetics. 2aPromoter Regions, Genetic 2aPseudomonasxgenetics 2aSequence Analysis, DNA 2aSequence Homology, Amino Acid 2aSequence Homology, Nucleic Acid 2aSiderophoresxbiosynthesisxgenetics. 2aTranscription Factorsxchemistryxgenetics. 0agenetic regulation 0apbsc gene 0apseudobactin 0apbsc locus 0aopen reading frame 0amolecular sequence data 0agenbank/x776991 aDowling, D.N.1 aO'Sullivan, D.J.1 aO'Gara, F.0 tMGG.g1994 June 3, v. 243, no. 5 p.515-524x0026-89257nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF002841993Available from publisher's Web site  a19941004b19941021c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US  mNon-PubAg articles 7aarticle04433naa a2200877 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002800110040001800138100001700156245017000173300001600343500001500359520171200374650002002086650002502106650001802131650002702149650002102176650001002197650002102207650003002228650002002258650002202278650001102300650001302311650002202324650004102346650001902387650002702406650001802433650002202451650002902473650001902502650002502521650002302546650003602569650002402605650001802629650002302647650001802670650003602688650002002724650001702744650002802761650002102789650002802810650001902838650005902857650004202916650003302958650002202991650001803013650002303031650002403054650003503078650002803113650002503141653003503166653003003201700001703231700001803248700001703266700001703283700001403300773006203314852000903376856007803385930003303463945001303496946001103509990002303520655001203543IND2040180320221120205731.0940609e199401  gw |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204018032DNAL7 a81591742pmid7 a10.1007/BF003910172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSaalbach, I.12aA chimeric gene encoding the methionine-rich 2S albumin of the Brazil nut (Bertholletia excelsa H.B.K.) is stably expressed and inherited in transgenic grain legumes  ap. 226-236.  a2019-12-04  aThe coding region of the 2S albumin gene of Brazil nut (Bertholletia excelsa H.B.K.) was completely synthesized, placed under control of the cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV) 35S promoter and inserted into the binary vector plasmid pGSGLUC1, thus giving rise to pGSGLUC1-2S. This was used for transformation of tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum L. cv. Petit Havanna) and of the grain legume Vicia narbonensis L., mediated by the supervirulent Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain EHA 101. Putative transformants were selected by screening for neomycin phosphotransferase (NPT II) and beta-glucuronidase (GUS) activities. Transgenic plants were grown until flowering and fruiting occurred. The presence of the foreign gene was confirmed by Southern analysis. GUS activity was found in all organs of the regenerated transgenic tobacco and legume plants, including the seeds. In the legume, the highest expression levels of the CaMV 35S promoter-controlled 2S albumin gene were observed in leaves and roots. 2S albumin was localized in the vacuoles of leaf mesophyll cells of transgenic tobacco. The Brazil nut protein was present in the 2S fraction after gel filtration chromatography of the legume seed proteins and could be clearly identified by immunoblotting. Analysis of seeds from the R2 progenies of the legume and of transgenic tobacco plants revealed Mendelian inheritance of the foreign gene. Agrobacterium rhizogenes strain RifR 15834 harbouring the binary vector pGSGLUC1-2S was also used to transform Pisum sativum L. and Vicia faba L. Hairy roots expressed the 2S albumin-specific gene.

The genetic variability of the seven loci was high for all the populations. The average numbers of alleles per locus ranged from 19.1 to 26.0, while the average observed and expected heterozygosity ranged from 0.474 to 0.616, and from 0.916 to 0.949, respectively. F(st) and R(st) values showed significant genetic differentiation among the five cultured populations. Genetic differences between the populations were also detected by pairwise comparison based on allelic distribution. The Neighbor-joining tree topology constructed on the basis of genetic distances between populations showed a clear separation of the northern three populations and southern two populations, suggesting that geographically separated cultured populations of C. gigas could be genetically differentiated unless seeds are transplanted among them. The useful information on the genetic variation and differentiation in cultured populations obtained in this study can be applied for future genetic improvement by selective breeding, and to design suitable management guidelines for the Pacific oyster. 3aCrassostrea gigas 3aoysters 3agenetic variation 3agenetic distance 3amicrosatellite repeats 3aloci 3aalleles 3agenetic polymorphism 3aheterozygosity 3aoyster culture 3amariculture 3aChina1 aYu, H.1 aYu, R.0 tAquaculture.g2006 Sept. 8, v. 259, no. 1-4 p.95-102dElsevier Pub.

Constant-concentration and constant-flux surface boundary conditions and semi-infinite and finite soil columns are considered. For the semi-infinite soils the quasi-analytical technique of Philip and Knight (1974) is very successful in predicting the water content profiles for the constant-concentration condition, and only moderately so for the constant-flux condition. Their iterative procedure for the flux-concentration function converges rapidly in the constant-concentration case but an analogous procedure diverges in the constant-flux case. For finite soils the simple assumption that the rate of drying of the column is independent of depth in the flow equation leads to accurate predictions of the water content profiles for the constant-concentration case, and for the constant-flux case if the potential evaporation is low, the soil is shallow, and/or the initial hydraulic diffusivity is high. For conditions other than these roughly accounting for the higher rate of drying that occurs near the surface in this case greatly improves the agreement. 3amathematical models 3aevaporation 3asoil profiles 3asoil water movement 0asoil physics0 tSoil Science Society of America journal.g1988 , v. 52, no. 4 p.916-924x0361-59957nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19881003c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle03522naa a2200685 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002800110040001800138100001600156245011700172300001600289500001500305520144400320650002201764650001801786650002101804650002201825650001801847650001301865650002601878650002001904650001401924650002501938650002001963650001201983650002001995650002402015650001802039650002302057650002602080650003102106650001802137650002002155650002802175650002702203650002802230650002402258650003902282650003702321650004702358650003402405650002702439653002302466653002302489653002802512653001402540653002502554700001602579773006202595852000902657856007802666930003302744945001302777946001102790990002302801655001202824IND2040179120221120174119.0940609e199401  gw |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204017912DNAL7 a81591672pmid7 a10.1007/BF003910102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBurke, J.D.10aMolecular cloning and characterization of the Schizosaccharomyces pombe his3 gene for use as a selectable marker  ap. 169-176.  a2019-12-04  aA DNA fragment which carries the his3 gene of Schizosaccharomyes pombe has been isolated and characterized for use as a selectable marker in transformations. The his3 gene encodes the imidazole acetol phosphate transaminase enzyme (E.C.2.6.1.9), which is responsible for converting imidazole acetol-P to histidinol-P in step 8 of histidine biosynthesis. The nucleotide sequences of a 2196 bp gene fragment and a corresponding cDNA clone were determined. Three intron sequences punctuate the 1451 bp coding region which generates a predicted polypeptide of 384 amino acids with a molecular mass of 42736 daltons. Northern analysis of his3 mRNAs indicates that the transcript is approximately 1.6 kb in size. Steady-state levels are down-regulated by nitrogen limitation but are unaffected by histidine starvation. The deduced amino acid sequence was compared to the Saccharomyces cerevisiae HIS5, Escherichia coli HisC, and Salmonella typhimurium HisC proteins, all of which are imidazole acetol phosphate transaminases. The S. pombe his3 protein was 49.5% identical to the S. cerevisiae HIS5 protein and 21.5% identity was found when all four proteins were compared. The shuttle vector pBG1 was constructed by subcloning the smallest functional region of his3 and the S. pombe ars1 sequence into pUC18 for use in transformation of His3 - S. pombe strains. New S. pombe strains in which the his3 gene was deleted have also been constructed. 3aSaccharomycetales 3amessenger RNA 3astructural genes 3acomplementary DNA 3atransaminases 3anitrogen 3anutrient availability 3aplasmid vectors 3ahistidine 3aamino acid sequences 3agene expression 3aintrons 3agenetic markers 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aBase Sequence 2aCloning, Molecular 2aDNA, Fungalxgenetics 2aEscherichia colixgenetics 2aGenes, Fungal 2aGenetic Markers 2aHistidinexbiosynthesis 2aHydro-Lyasesxgenetics 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aRestriction Mapping 2aSaccharomyces cerevisiaexgenetics 2aSalmonella typhimuriumxgenetics 2aSchizosaccharomycesxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aSequence Homology, Amino Acid 2aTranscription, Genetic 0agenetic regulation 0ain vitro selection 0amolecular sequence data 0adeletions 0anucleotide sequences1 aGould, K.L.0 tMGG.g1994 Jan., v. 242, no. 2 p.169-176x0026-89257nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF003910103Available from publisher's Web site  a19940720b19940722c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US  mNon-PubAg articles 7aarticle03428naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134072000900152072000900161100001700170245014400187300001600331500002400347520197000371650002302341650002202364650001802386650001702404650003002421650002602451650001502477650002402492650004202516650002202558650001502580650002002595651001602615653001902631700001702650700001602667700001502683773009202698852000902790856007602799930003302875945002502908946001302933655001202946IND4383932420221120163415.0060928e200611  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438393242DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biocontrol.2006.07.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF900 0aE1001 aJarvis, P.J.10aPredicting the economic benefits and costs of introducing new biological control agents for Scotch broom Cytisus scoparius into New Zealand  ap. 135-146.  aIncludes references  aWe estimated the potential benefits and costs of introducing three candidate biological control agents against the invasive weed Scotch broom Cytisus scoparius into New Zealand. Farming, forestry, the Department of Conservation, district and regional councils should benefit from a successful biological control programme against broom. However, costs may be incurred by beekeepers who benefit from broom pollen, and due to potential non-target attack to Chamaecytisus palmensis, an exotic relative of broom, which is a minor fodder crop and is occasionally planted for erosion control on marginal hill country. Due to uncertainties regarding the costs, we adopted a risk-averse approach by assuming a worse-case scenario where levels of non-target damage to C. palmensis are similar to those on C. scoparius and that no pollen sources suitable for beekeeping will replace broom stands. Due to uncertainties regarding the level of control that will be achieved, we calculate a single best estimate for overall benefits of the proposed programme using an average of four potential biocontrol scenarios: no control, and 25, 50, or 95% reductions in broom, weighted according to the success rate of past biological control programmes against legume weeds worldwide. We estimated that benefits would outweigh costs by 2.9:1 (the weighted ratio of benefits to costs), with an annual net benefit to New Zealand of $5.99 million, once biological control agents are fully established nationwide. Using discounting techniques over 50 years, we calculate an internal rate of return of 52%, and a net present value of $61.49 million at the 5% discount rate and $21.95 million at the 10% discount rate. These returns are robust to significant overestimation of benefits and to significant underestimation of costs. The potential costs of successful biological control of Scotch broom should not prevent the introduction of additional biological control agents into New Zealand. 3abiological control 3aCytisus scoparius 3anoxious weeds 3aweed control 3abiological control agents 3acost benefit analysis 3aapiculture 3anontarget organisms 3aChamaecytisus prolifer var. palmensis 3acosts and returns 3aprediction 3arisk assessment 3aNew Zealand 0ainvasive weeds1 aFowler, S.V.1 aPaynter, Q.1 aSyrett, P.0 tBiological control.g2006 Nov., v. 39, no. 2 p.135-146dAcademic Pressx1049-96447nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biocontrol.2006.07.0123electronic resource  a20061020b20061102c00000000  aINDdNZMe2006/10/20  aOther US 7aarticle03188naa a2200625 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002800110040001800138100001500156245010100171300001600272520138400288650002001672650001801692650002901710650002101739650002101760650001201781650002001793650002401813650001501837650003101852650003301883650001801916650002401934650002301958650000801981650001501989650001702004650001702021650001202038650002202050650002802072650002102100650002902121650003002150650003902180650002402219653001402243700001702257700001502274700001902289700001302308773006202321852000902383856007802392930003302470945001302503946001102516990002302527655001202550IND2036161920221120163746.0931207e199308  gw |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND203616192DNAL7 a83556582pmid7 a10.1007/BF002770652doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKleine, M.10aConstruction of a barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) YAC library and isolation of a Hor1-specific clone  ap. 265-272.  aWe have constructed an EcoRI-based YAC (yeast artificial chromosome) library from barley (Hordeum vulgare L. cv. Franka) using the vector pYAC4. The library consists of approximately 18000 recombinant YACs with insert sizes ranging between 100 and 1000 kb (average of 160 kb) corresponding to 50% of the barley genome. Size fractionation after ligation resulted in an increased average insert size (av. 370 kb) but also in a substantial decrease in cloning efficiency. Less than 1% of the colonies showed homology to a plastome-specific probe; approximately 50% of the colonies displayed a signal with a dispersed, highly repetitive barley-specific probe. Using a primer combination deduced from the sequence of a member of the small Hor1 gene family coding for the C-hordein storage proteins, the library was screened by polymerase chain reaction and subsequently by the colony hybridization technique. A single YAC, designated Y66C11, with a 120 kb insert was isolated. This DNA fragment represents a coherent stretch from the terminal part of the Hor1 gene region as judged from the correspondence of the restriction patterns between Y66C11 DNA and barley DNA after hybridization with the Hor1-specific probe. Restriction with the isoschizomeric enzymes HpaII/MspI suggests a high degree of methylation of the Hor1 region in mesophyll cells but not in YAC-derived (yeast) DNA. 3aHordeum vulgare 3aDNA libraries 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3astructural genes 3amultigene family 3ahordein 3aDNA methylation 3arestriction mapping 3aDNA probes 3anucleic acid hybridization 3ayeast artificial chromosomes 2aBase Sequence 2aChromosomes, Fungal 2aCloning, Molecular 2aDNA 2aDNA Probes 2aGene Library 2aGenes, Plant 2aGlutens 2aHordeumxgenetics 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aMultigene Family 2aPlant Proteinsxgenetics 2aPolymerase Chain Reaction 2aRepetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid 2aRestriction Mapping 0ahor1 gene1 aMichalek, W.1 aGraner, A.1 aHerrmann, R.G.1 aJung, C.0 tMGG.g1993 Aug., v. 240, no. 2 p.265-272x0026-89257nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF002770653Available from publisher's Web site  a19940105b19940110c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US  mNon-PubAg articles 7aarticle02404naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001400145245006600159300001800225500002400243520117200267650003401439650002301473650002501496650002001521650001201541650002201553650000901575650005201584650001901636650004001655700001301695700001901708700001401727700002101741700001301762700001901775773010601794852000901900856008501909655001201994IND4418706820221120153612.0090403s2009    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441870682DNAL7 a10.1007/s11033-008-9288-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTeng, Yan10aProtective effect of puerarin on diabetic retinopathy in rats  ap. 1129-1133.  aIncludes references  aPuerarin is a major active ingredient extracted from the traditional Chinese medicine Ge-gen. The purpose of this study is to investigate the protective effect of puerarin on diabetic retinopathy (DR) and its mechanisms in rats. Seventy-two male Wistar rats were selected and divided at random into three main groups: control group, streptozotocin (STZ) group and puerarin + STZ group. Retinal histopathological observation and electron microscopic examination were performed; retinal vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and hypoxia inducible factor 1 (HIF-1α) gene expressions were examined by Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis. Results showed that the DR induced by STZ was significantly reduced by the treatment of puerarin as judged by the reduction of morphological changes of inner nuclear layer and outer nuclear layer at any time-point. Puerarin regulates expressions of VEGF and HIF-1α stimulated by STZ. It was concluded that puerarin exerts significant protective effects against DR in rats, likely regulating angiogenesis factors expressions, and thus may be an effective and promising medicine for treatment of DR. 3aOriental traditional medicine 3aactive ingredients 3adiabetic retinopathy 3agene expression 3ahypoxia 3aprotective effect 3arats 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3astreptozotocin 3avascular endothelial growth factors1 aCui, Hao1 aYang, Mingming1 aSong, Han1 aZhang, Qingsheng1 aSu, Ying1 aZheng, Jianqiu0 tMolecular biology reports.g2009 May, v. 36, no. 5 p.1129-1133dSpringer Netherlandsx0301-48517nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11033-008-9288-23Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02154naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002800092040001800120100001300138245012700151300001600278500001500294520068700309650002100996650001601017650000801033650001201041650001701053650002101070650001901091650002301110650002501133650002601158653003201184653001101216653001501227653001401242653002801256653001401284653002701298700001501325700001301340700001401353700001401367700001401381773006201395852000901457856007801466930003301544945001301577946001101590990002301601655001201624IND2036161420221120153536.0931207e199308  gw |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND203616142DNAL7 a10.1007/BF002770642doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPapp, I.14aThe baceterial attachment site of the temperature Rhizobium phage 16-3 overlaps the 3' end of a putative proline tRNA gene  ap. 258-264.  a2019-12-04  aBacteriophage 16-3 inserts its genome into the chromosome of Rhizobium meliloti strain 41 (Rm4l) by site-specific recombination. The DNA regions around the bacterial attachment site (attB) and one of the hybrid attachment sites bordering the integrated prophage (attL) were cloned and their nucleotide sequences determined. We demonstrated that the 51 bp region, where the phage and bacterial DNA sequences are identical, is active as a target site for phage integration. Furthermore it overlaps the 3' end of a putative proline tRNA gene. This gene shows 79% similarly to the corresponding proline tRNA-like genomic target sequence of certain integrative plasmids in Actinomycetes. 3astructural genes 3achromosomes 3aDNA 3aproline 3atransfer RNA 3aEnsifer meliloti 3abacteriophages 3achromosome mapping 3anucleotide sequences 3agenetic recombination 0asite specific recombination 0agenome 0aatt region 0aattb site 0amolecular sequence data 0aattp site 0aSinorhizobium meliloti1 aDorgai, L.1 aPapp, P.1 aJonas, E.1 aOlasz, F.1 aOrosz, L.0 tMGG.g1993 Aug., v. 240, no. 2 p.258-264x0026-89257nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF002770643Available from publisher's Web site  a19940105b19940110c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US  mNon-PubAg articles 7aarticle02474naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002800092040001800120100001300138245013900151300001600290500001500306520101500321650002501336650001801361650001501379650002101394650001001415650002001425650002201445650002501467650002501492650001301517650001601530650001001546653001601556653002301572653001301595653001401608653001401622653001601636653001701652700001701669700001501686700001401701773006201715852000901777856007801786930003301864945001301897946001101910990002301921655001201944IND2036160820221120153601.0931207e199308  gw |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND203616082DNAL7 a10.1007/BF002770622doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBock, R.10aTissue- and stage-specific modulation of RNA editing of the psbF and psbL transcript from spinach plastids--a new regulaory mechanism?  ap. 238-244.  a2019-12-04  aThe psbE operon of spinach chloroplasts, which includes the genes psbE, psbF, psbL and psbJ, encodes two RNA editing sites. One site corresponds to the initiation codon of the psbL transcript, as has been described earlier for the homologous transcript from tobacco, while at a second editing site, newly reported here, an internal phenylalanine codon of the psbF transcript is restored. Both these sites were investigated with respect to the extent of editing in spinach plastids at various developmental stages. The apparent existence of only completely edited transcripts in etioplasts and chloroplasts, indicates that light-induced processes are not acting as determinants in eliciting the editing process. Reduced editing is, however, observed in the psbF and psbL transcript from seeds and roots. This finding suggests that the RNA editing process is differentially down-regulated in leucoplasts and proplastids and that editing may, therefore, function as a regulatory device in plastid gene expression. 3acell differentiation 3amessenger RNA 3aetioplasts 3astructural genes 3aseeds 3achloroplast DNA 3aSpinacia oleracea 3aamino acid sequences 3anucleotide sequences 3agenomics 3aRNA editing 3aroots 0aleucoplasts 0agenetic regulation 0aplastids 0apsbl gene 0apsbf gene 0aproplastids 0achloroplasts1 aHagemann, R.1 aKossel, H.1 aKudla, J.0 tMGG.g1993 Aug., v. 240, no. 2 p.238-244x0026-89257nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF002770623Available from publisher's Web site  a19940105b19940110c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US  mNon-PubAg articles 7aarticle02988naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001300164245012200177300001800299500002400317520114000341650001501481650001001496650001001506650001701516650001001533650003101543650001501574650001801589650002201607650000901629650001301638650001201651650002801663650002701691650004001718650005701758650004501815650005301860650003101913650004201944650000901986650001701995650006502012700001902077700001902096700001402115700001902129700001502148700001602163700001902179773010602198852000902304856008502313655001202398IND4418706720221120153611.0090403s2009    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441870672DNAL7 a185747112pmid7 a10.1007/s11033-008-9287-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSun, Zhe10aRecombinant hirudin treatment modulates aquaporin-4 and aquaporin-9 expression after intracerebral hemorrhage in vivo  ap. 1119-1127.  aIncludes references  aEdema formation has been linked to thrombin toxicity induced by blood clot at the acute stage of intracerebral hemorrhage. Thrombin induces cell toxicity in neuron, microglia and astrocyte. Aquaporin (AQP) 4 and 9 are proteins expressed on astrocyte in rat brain and involved in the brain water accumulation in brain edema. Recombinant hirudin (r-Hirudin) is a direct inhibitor of thrombin that can block the toxicitic effect of thrombin. In this study, we demonstrated that autologous whole blood infusion in caudate nucleus up-regulates the expression of AQP4 and AQP9 mRNAs and proteins. AQP4 and AQP9 mRNAs expression peaked at about 6 h after blood infusion. The AQP4 protein peaked at about 48 h while AQP9 at about 24 h after blood infusion. Thrombin induced up-regulation of AQP4 and AQP9 were inhibited by r-Hirudin administration and significantly decreased the expression of both AQPs. We further investigated the relationship between edema formation and expression of AQP4 and AQP9. The data presented here may be helpful in optimizing r-Hirudin as an anti-thrombin drug in the treatment of edema at the acute stage of ICH. 3aaquaporins 3ablood 3abrain 3adrug therapy 3aedema 3agene expression regulation 3ahemorrhage 3amessenger RNA 3aprotein synthesis 3arats 3athrombin 2aAnimals 2aAquaporin 4xmetabolism 2aAquaporinsxmetabolism 2aBrain Edemaxmetabolismxpathology. 2aCerebral Hemorrhagexchemically inducedxmetabolism. 2aGene Expression Regulationxdrug effects 2aHirudinsxadministration & dosagexpharmacology. 2aMagnetic Resonance Imaging 2aRNA, Messengerxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aRats 2aRats, Wistar 2aRecombinant Proteinsxadministration & dosagexpharmacology.1 aZhao, Zhenhuan1 aZhao, Shiguang1 aSheng, Yi1 aZhao, Zonghang1 aGao, Cheng1 aLi, Jingwen1 aLiu, Xiangzhen0 tMolecular biology reports.g2009 May, v. 36, no. 5 p.1119-1127dSpringer Netherlandsx0301-48517nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11033-008-9287-33Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03466naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092024002200127024001900149040001800168100002200186245014900208300001600357500001500373506007600388520171800464506003702182650002502219650001802244650001402262650001902276650000802295650001602303650003102319650001902350650002002369650000902389650002302398650001202421650002202433650001402455650002102469650002502490650001102515650001002526650001702536653001002553700002202563700001602585700002202601700002202623773010302645852000902748856008502757930003302842946001302875655001202888IND4418736920221207050436.0090403e200809  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441873692DNAL7 a10.1007/s00335-008-9138-52doi7 aPMC49108192pmcid7 a187630162pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNystuen, Arne M. 12aA novel mutation in Prph2, a gene regulated by Nr2e3, causes retinal degeneration and outer-segment defects similar to Nr2e3 rd⁷/rd⁷ retinas  ap. 623-633.  a2019-12-04  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe nmf193 mutant was generated by a large-scale ENU mutagenesis screen and originally described as having a dominantly inherited phenotype characterized by fundus abnormalities. We determined that nmf193 mice exhibit outer-segment defects and progressive retinal degeneration. Clinical examination revealed retinal spotting apparent at 6 weeks of age. Histologic analysis of homozygous mutant mice at 6 weeks indicated an absence of outer segments (OS) and a 50% reduction of photoreceptor cells which progressed to complete loss of photoreceptors by 10 months. Mice heterozygous for the nmf193 mutation had a less severe phenotype of shortened outer segments at 2 months with progressive loss of photoreceptor cells to 50% by 10 months. A positional cloning approach using a DNA pooling strategy was performed to identify the causative mutation in nmf193 mice. The nmf193 mutation was linked to chromosome 17 and fine mapped to an interval containing the peripherin/rds (Prph2) gene. Mutation analysis identified a single base change in Prph2 that causes aberrant splicing between exons 1 and 2. Interestingly, a comparative histologic analysis demonstrated that Prph2 nmf¹⁹³/⁺ mutants have similar photoreceptor degeneration to that of Nr2e3 rd⁷/rd⁷ . We show that Prph2 mRNA and protein levels are reduced in the Nr2e3 rd⁷/rd⁷ mutant compared to control littermates. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis shows that Prph2 is a direct target of NR2E3. In addition, the downregulation of Prph2 gene expression is similar in both the Nr2e3 rd⁷/rd⁷ and Prph2 nmf¹⁹³/⁺ mutants, suggesting that the reduction of Prph2 may contribute to the degenerative pathology seen in Nr2e3 rd⁷/rd⁷ .0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3amacular degeneration 3amessenger RNA 3aphenotype 3aphotoreceptors 3aDNA 3amutagenesis 3agene expression regulation 3aheterozygosity 3agene expression 3amice 3achromosome mapping 3amutants 3amolecular cloning 3achromatin 3aprecipitin tests 3aclinical examination 3aretina 3aexons 3ahomozygosity 0agenes1 aSachs, Andrew J. 1 aYuan, Yang 1 aHeuermann, Laura 1 aHaider, Neena B. 0 tMammalian genome.g2008 Sept., v. 19, no. 9 p.623-633dNew York : Springer-Verlagx0938-89907nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00335-008-9138-53Available from publisher's Web site  a20090404b20090508c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02968naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002800111040001800139100001700157245008800174300001600262500001500278520159500293650002101888650002401909650001401933650002901947650002201976650002201998650002302020650002502043650001902068650002402087650001402111650001802125650003902143653001402182653002502196700001902221773008902240852000902329856007802338930003302416945001302449946001302462990002302475655001202498IND2206543920221120132818.0000821e199909  nyu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220654392DNAL7 a104737762pmid7 a10.1007/PL000065582doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJordan, I.K.14aThe role of interelement selection in Saccharomyces cerevisiae Ty element evolution  ap. 352-357.  a2019-12-04  aRetrotransposons are mobile genetic elements that are ubiquitous components of eukaryotic genomes. The evolutionary success of retrotransposons is explained by their ability to replicate faster than the host genomes in which they reside. Elements with higher rates of genomic replication possess a selective advantage over less active elements. Retrotransposon populations, therefore, are shaped largely by selective forces acting at the genomic level between elements. To evaluate rigorously the effects of selective forces acting on retrotransposons, detailed information on the patterns of molecular variation within and between retrotransposon families is needed. The sequencing of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae genome, which includes the entire genomic complement of yeast retrotransposons, provides an unprecedented opportunity to access and analyze such data. In this study, we analyzed in detail the patterns of nucleotide variation within the open reading frames of two parental (Ty 1 and Ty 2) and one hybrid (Ty 1/2) family of yeast retrotransposons. The pattern and distribution of nucleotide changes on the phylogenetic reconstructions of the three families of Ty elements reveal evidence of negative selection on both internal and external branches of the Ty phylogenies. These results indicate that most, if not all, Ty elements examined represent active or recently active retrotransposon lineages. We discuss the relevance of these findings with respect to the coevolutionary dynamic operating between genomic element populations and the host organisms in which they reside. 3aretrotransposons 3aopen reading frames 3aphylogeny 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3anatural selection 3agenetic variation 2aDatabases, Factual 2aEvolution, Molecular 2aGenome, Fungal 2aOpen Reading Frames 2aPhylogeny 2aRetroelements 2aSaccharomyces cerevisiaexgenetics 0aevolution 0anucleotide sequences1 aMcDonald, J.F.0 tJournal of molecular evolution.g1999 Sept., v. 49, no. 3 p.352-357x0022-28447nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/PL000065583Available from publisher's Web site  a20001102b20001113c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US  mNon-PubAg articles 7aarticle02961naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002500145245014000170300001800310520143900328650002201767650001201789650001201801650001101813650001301824650001201837650000901849650000901858650001401867650001401881650001201895650002101907650002101928650000701949650001301956650003501969650001902004650002702023650001602050650000902066653001202075653002402087653002802111700002602139773014002165852000902305856008502314930003302399946001102432655001202443IND4395817820221120132811.0071007e200711  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439581782DNAL7 a10.1007/s11274-007-9404-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSoni, Sarvesh Kumar 10aProduction and partial characterization of two types of phytase from Aspergillus niger NCIM 563 under submerged fermentation conditions  ap. 1585-1593.  aNovel extracellular phytase was produced by Aspergillus niger NCIM 563 under submerged fermentation conditions at 30 °C in medium containing dextrin and glucose as carbon sources along with sodium nitrate as nitrogen source. Maximum phytase activity (41.47 IU/mL at pH 2.5 and 10.71 IU/mL at pH 4.0) was obtained when dextrin was used as carbon source along with glucose and sodium nitrate as nitrogen source. Nearly 13 times increase in phytase activity was observed when phosphate in the form of KH₂PO₄ (0.004 g/100 mL) was added in the fermentation medium. Physic-chemical properties of partially purified enzyme indicate the possibility of two distinct forms of phytases, Phy I and Phy II. Optimum pH and temperature for Phy I was 2.5 and 60 °C while Phy II was 4.0 and 60 °C, respectively. Phy I was stable in the pH range 1.5-3.5 while Phy II was stable in the wider pH range, 2.0-7.0. Molecular weight of Phy I and Phy II on Sephacryl S-200 was approximately 304 kDa and 183 kDa, respectively. Phy I activity was moderately stimulated in the presence of 1 mM Mg²⁺, Mn²⁺, Ca²⁺ and Fe³⁺ ions and inhibited by Zn²⁺ and Cd²⁺ ions while Phy II activity was moderately stimulated by Fe³⁺ ions and was inhibited by Hg²⁺, Mn²⁺ and Zn²⁺ ions at 1 mM concentration in reaction mixture. The Km for Phy I and II was 3.18 and 0.514 mM while Vmax was 331.16 and 59.47 μmols/min/mg protein, respectively. 3aAspergillus niger 3acadmium 3acalcium 3acarbon 3adextrins 3aglucose 3aions 3airon 3amagnesium 3amanganese 3amercury 3amolecular weight 3anitrate nitrogen 3apH 3aphytases 3apotassium dihydrogen phosphate 3asodium nitrate 3asubmerged fermentation 3atemperature 3azinc 0aPhytase 0aPhytate degradation 0aPoultry feed supplement1 aKhire, Jayant Malhar 0 tWorld journal of microbiology & biotechnology.g2007 Nov., v. 23, no. 11 p.1585-1593dDordrecht : Springer Netherlandsx0959-39937nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11274-007-9404-93Available from publisher's Web site  a20071007b20071102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03303naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134072000900152100001500161245016900176300001600345500002400361500001500385520165400400650002302054650001802077650001302095650001702108650002602125650002702151650000902178650002002187650001502207650002002222650001502242650002702257650001702284650002602301651001102327653003002338700002102368700001602389700001702405700001602422700001502438700001502453700001702468773009202485852000902577856009202586930003302678945002502711946001302736655001202749IND4383933720221120132842.0060928e200611  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438393372DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biocontrol.2006.06.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF8311 aKrauss, U.14aThe effect of cane molasses amendment on biocontrol of frosty pod rot (Moniliophthora roreri) and black pod (Phytophthora spp.) of cocoa (Theobroma cacao) in Panama  ap. 232-239.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aFrosty pod rot (FPR), caused by Moniliophthora roreri, and black pod (BP), caused by Phytophthora spp., of cocoa (Theobroma cacao) cause combined pod losses of more than 80% in Panama. Biological control of both diseases appeared promising in Peru and is desired by certified organic producers in Panama. We evaluated both local and Peruvian fungal antagonists in participatory trials on smallholdings during two complete production cycles. Furthermore, we tested the influence of a 3% v/v cane molasses amendment on biocontrol efficacy, yield and population dynamics of mycoparasites on the cocoa pod. Significant variation was observed between the two years: FPR was more severe in the first year, BP in the second. FPR was significantly reduced by biocontrol agents (BCAs), but not by the molasses amendment. However, BCAs responded differently to molasses in both years. All BCAs reduced inoculum production by M. roreri with no consistent effect of molasses. BCAs had a lesser and more variable effect on BP, whereas molasses reduced BP slightly by increasing the efficacy of native antagonists. All BCAs and the molasses amendment enhanced the percentage of healthy pods. Molasses was beneficial to absolute yield, but only one inoculum improved yield significantly in the first year. Populations of a Peruvian Trichoderma asperellum isolate remained high for over two months after application to surface-sterilized pods. Molasses had no effect on establishment or survival of this antagonist or recolonization by any native mycoparasite. The reasons for enhanced biocontrol efficacy of the molasses formulation requires further investigation. 3afungal antagonists 3amycoparasites 3amolasses 3aPhytophthora 3anutrient availability 3aTrichoderma asperellum 3apods 3aTheobroma cacao 3aplant rots 3adisease control 3acrop yield 3aplant pathogenic fungi 3aClonostachys 3aMoniliophthora roreri 3aPanama 0abiological control agents1 aHoopen, G.M. ten1 aHidalgo, E.1 aMartinez, A.1 aStirrup, T.1 aArroyo, C.1 aGarcia, J.1 aPalacios, M.0 tBiological control.g2006 Nov., v. 39, no. 2 p.232-239dAcademic Pressx1049-96447nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biocontrol.2006.06.0053Available from publisher's Web site  a20090626b20090703c00000000  aINDdNZMe2006/10/20  aOther US 7aarticle02873naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134072000900152072000900161072000900170100001500179245013000194300001600324500002400340520135500364650001401719650001601733650003001749650002101779650001901800650001701819650002401836650001601860650001401876650001601890650001401906650002301920650001801943650001101961653002301972653002801995653002002023700001602043700001802059700001802077773009202095852000902187856007602196930003302272945002502305946001302330655001202343IND4383933920221120133208.0060928e200611  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438393392DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biocontrol.2006.06.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF821 0aL100 0aL0011 aSime, K.R.10aComparison of two laboratory cultures of Psyttalia concolor (Hymenoptera: Braconidae), as a parasitoid of the olive fruit fly  ap. 248-255.  aIncludes references  aLife-history trials were conducted in the laboratory on two cultures of Psyttalia concolor (Szépligeti) (Hymenoptera: Braconidae) reared on olive fruit fly, Bactrocera oleae (Rossi) (Diptera: Tephritidae). The tested cultures (A and B) had similar histories except that Culture A was maintained in Kenya for four years. Results showed that parasitoids from both cultures preferentially searched on olive fruit containing 8 to 10-day-old (second and third instar) olive flies, and reproduced most successfully when third-instar fly larvae were available. The mean longevity of adult female P. concolor was a negative function of temperature. Females from Culture B lived significantly longer at 15, 22, 25, and 32 °C than females from Culture A. For both cultures, adult female longevity was significantly longer when the parasitoids were provided with honey than when provided water alone, or nothing; the presence of hosts significantly reduced longevity, suggesting an energetic cost for reproduction. The parasitoids produced an average of 28.7 ± 4.1 and 22.2 ± 5.1 offspring per female in Cultures A and B, respectively. The results are discussed with respect to use of biological control agents held under different rearing conditions, and the potential of P. concolor for use as a biological control agent for olive fruit fly in California. 3aPsyttalia 3aparasitoids 3abiological control agents 3aBactrocera oleae 3ainsect rearing 3alife history 3ainsect reproduction 3aoviposition 3afecundity 3atemperature 3alongevity 3anutritional status 3aOlea europaea 3aolives 0aparasitoid biology 0aintraspecific variation 0ahost adaptation1 aDaane, K.M.1 aMessing, R.H.1 aJohnson, M.W.0 tBiological control.g2006 Nov., v. 39, no. 2 p.248-255dAcademic Pressx1049-96447nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biocontrol.2006.06.0073electronic resource  a20061020b20061102c00000000  aINDdNZMe2006/10/20  aOther US 7aarticle02986naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100003100145245010000176300001600276520162400292650002301916650002601939650001601965650001201981650002201993650001502015650001502030650001202045650002102057650001402078650001902092650001302111650002002124653002902144653002602173700002102199700001802220700002702238773013702265852000902402856008502411930003302496946001102529655001202540IND4397158420221120133053.0071028e200607  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439715842DNAL7 a10.1007/s11274-005-9102-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHernández-Rodríguez, D. 10aDegradation of endosulfan during substrate preparation and cultivation of Pleurotus pulmonarius  ap. 753-760.  aEndosulfan is an insecticide used on many vegetable crops. In mushroom cultivation, vegetable materials used as a growth substrate may contain residues of endosulfan that may accumulate in the final mushroom biomass. After preparing the substrate, it is subjected to pasteurization and/or composting and then inoculated with the desired fungus. The purpose of this research was to determine the rate and extent of endosulfan reduction from a grass substrate that was either composted or sterilized by autoclaving. In addition, the rate and extent of removal of endosulfan from substrate colonized with Pleurotus pulmonarius was determined. The degradation of 65 mg/kg endosulfan was analyzed on both, the substrate preparation and the culture of P. pulmonarius on the grass Digitaria decumbens. During composting in presence of Ca(OH)₂ for 120 h, the concentrations of α and β endosulfan were reduced by 61.4 and 49.5% respectively, significantly higher compared with the control (without Ca(OH)₂,) in which the reduction was 38.5%. After sterilization the concentration of α and β endosulfan was reduced by 84.8 and 87.5% respectively. After the colonization of substrate by P. pulmonarius (15 days after spawning) α and β endosulfan were reduced by 96% and at the end of cultivation (35 days after spawning) were reduced by 99%. When carpophores were analyzed, residues of α and β endosulfan were observed between 0.019-0.084 mg/kg. The results showed that α and β endosulfan were partially removed during the preparation of substrate and entirely eliminated during fungal colonization on the substrate. 3aDigitaria eriantha 3aPleurotus pulmonarius 3aautoclaving 3abiomass 3acalcium hydroxide 3acomposting 3aendosulfan 3agrasses 3amushroom growing 3amushrooms 3apasteurization 3aspawning 3avegetable crops 0acultivation of Pleurotus 0asubstrate preparation1 aSánchez, J.

EGCG showed a significant cytotoxic effect on 1321N1 cells after 24 h and on U87-MG cells after 72 h (P < 0.001) without significantly affecting the normal astrocytes. Treatment with EGCG inhibited telomerase expression significantly (P < 0.01) and enhanced the effect of cisplatin and tamoxifen in both 1321N1 (P < 0.01) and U87-MG (P < 0.001) cells.

To characterize the multiple stage-specific transcription elements necessary for ZNF230 expression, we cloned ZNF230 promoter and constructed chimeric luciferase reporter Plasmids. Overexpression and site-directed mutation test were used to characterize the cis-element. The results showed ZNF230 gene promoter to be GC rich and not contain a TATA box. Deletion analysis of the 5'-flanking region of ZNF230 in HEK293 cells indicated that the sequence encompassing from nt -131 to +152 has a basal transcriptional activity. Site-directed mutation test and mithramycin A treatment demonstrated that the ZNF230 promoter contained a functional Sp1 site. Overexpression of the Sox5 protein activated the promoter activity. A 312-bp fragment surrounding the transcription start site exhibits a characteristic CpG island which overlaps with the promoter region. We also provided evidence that both the human and mouse znf230 promoter consist of Sp1 binding site and GC-rich sequences, suggesting Sp1 is required for the transcription of human and mouse ZNF230 genes. In conclusion, these findings suggest that ZNF230 is tightly controlled at transcriptional level and a common mechanism controls the basal transcription of ZNF230 gene. 3aTATA box 3abinding sites 3agene overexpression 3agenes 3agenomic islands 3ahumans 3amice 3amutation 3aplasmids 3aspermatogenesis 3atestes 3atranscription (genetics) 2aAnimals 2aBase Sequence 2aBinding Sites 2aCpG Islandsxgenetics 2aDNA-Binding Proteinsxgenetics 2aGene Expression Regulation 2aHumans 2aMale 2aMice 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aOrgan Specificity 2aPromoter Regions, Genetic 2aSOXD Transcription Factorsxmetabolism 2aSequence Alignment 2aSequence Analysis, DNA 2aSequence Deletion 2aSequence Homology, Nucleic Acid 2aSp1 Transcription Factorxmetabolism 2aSpermatogenesisxgenetics 2aSpermatozoaxmetabolism 2aTranscription Factorsxgenetics 2aTranscription, Genetic1 aZhang, Sizhong1 aQiu, Weimin1 aHe, Guoping1 aLiu, Yunqiang1 aSun, Yan1 aMa, Yongxin1 aDong, Jingtao1 aZhang, Wei0 tMolecular biology reports.g2009 May, v. 36, no. 5 p.1187-1193dSpringer Netherlandsx0301-48517nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11033-008-9296-23Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02523naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002400145245010100169300001600270520121100286650002301497650001301520650001801533650002601551650001701577650001801594650001801612650001701630650001501647650001101662650003201673650001301705653001601718653001701734653001301751653001201764653001101776700001601787773013601803852000901939856008501948930003302033946001102066655001202077IND4397165920221120133258.0071028e200605  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439716592DNAL7 a10.1007/s11274-005-9064-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFakhruddin, A.N.M. 14aThe response of Pseudomonas putida CP1 cells to nutritional, chemical and environmental stresses  ap. 507-514.  aThe response of a pollutant-degrading bacterium P. putida CP1 to stresses was investigated. The growth on the mono-chlorophenols resulted in a decrease in dry weight of the organism, although there was an increase in cell number. There was a change of bacterial shape from rod to round as well as the reduction of cell size when grown on phenol and chlorophenols. Changes in cell shape and size were also evident in glucose-free medium, which suggested that alteration of cell shape from rod to round as well as reduction of cell size were due to nutritional stress. The increase in cell number but a drop in dry weight correlated with the reduction of cell size and shape. The organism flocculated with chlorophenols but not with phenol. The cause of flocculation was due to the toxicity of chlorophenol. Isomerization of cis to trans forms of the unsaturated fatty acids in P. putida CP1 occurred under conditions of environmental stress. Trace amounts of the polyunsaturated fatty acid linoleic acid (cis-9, cis-12-octadecadienoic acid) rarely found in bacterial membranes and oleic acid (cis-9-octadecanoic acid), which is a typical product of aerobic fatty acid synthesis, were found in P. putida CP1. 3aPseudomonas putida 3abacteria 3achlorophenols 3aenvironmental factors 3aflocculation 3aisomerization 3alinoleic acid 3amalnutrition 3aoleic acid 3aphenol 3apolyunsaturated fatty acids 3atoxicity 0aAggregation 0achlorophenol 0aresponse 0asolvent 0astress1 aQuilty, B. 0 tWorld journal of microbiology & biotechnology.g2006 May, v. 22, no. 5 p.507-514dDordrecht : Springer Netherlandsx0959-39937nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11274-005-9064-63Available from publisher's Web site  a20071028b20071102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02809naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002400145245011500169300001400284520144100298650002001739650002701759650000801786650001801794650001501812650001301827650001701840650001701857650001001874650001001884650002901894650002501923650003001948650002201978650001402000653001102014653001902025653001602044700001802060773013502078852000902213856008502222930003302307946001102340655001202351IND4396294620221120133137.0071021e200701  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439629462DNAL7 a10.1007/s11274-006-9193-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOguntoyinbo, F.

B. subtilis and B. cereus strains isolated from okpehe were evaluated for their possible possession of virulence characteristics. Fifty isolates were screened for their ability to produce diarrhoea enterotoxin by reversed passive latex agglutination (BCET-RPLA) test kit; the result showed that 40% of the B. cereus strains were toxigenic. The ability of the selected isolates to compete in situ and in vitro toxin production during the fermentation was also determined. The enterotoxin was not detected using BCET-RPLA kit in the spontaneously fermented samples of okpehe, but the toxin was detected in the okpehe samples fermented using B. cereus enterotoxin producer in mixed starter culture fermentation. The PCR amplification of virulence genes revealed that Bacillus cereus and B. licheniformis, a strain from the B. subtilis group, contained DNA sequences encoding the haemolysin BL (hblD) enterotoxin complex. The growth ability of B. cereus strains to high population during the fermentation and the presence of detectable diarroheagenic genes in B. cereus and B. licheniformis showed that strains carrying virulence characteristics cannot be totally ruled out in traditionally fermented okpehe. 3aBacillus cereus 3aBacillus licheniformis 3aDNA 3aagglutination 3acondiments 3adiarrhea 3aenterotoxins 3afermentation 3agenes 3alatex 3amultiple strain starters 3anucleotide sequences 3apolymerase chain reaction 3atoxigenic strains 3avirulence 0aOkpehe 0aFermented-food 0aEnterotoxin1 aSanni, A.

Thatcher) with the genes of resistance to brown rust introgressed from Agropyron species was studied using light microscopy. This disease is induced by the fungus Puccinia triticina Erikss. The presence of superoxide anion in the sites of infection was detected with the dye nitro blue tetrazolium. In addition, we studied fungus development on plants treated with the inhibitor of Ca²⁺-channels, verapamil, disturbing penetration into the cells of Ca²⁺ required for ROS generation. During fungus development in the immune line with the Lr38 resistance gene (from A. intermedium (Host) Beuv.), oxidative burst developed at the sites of contacts of appressoria with stomata and exerted a fungicidic effect. When ROS generation was suppressed, the fungus developed haustoria in the mesophyll cells. In plants with the Lr19 gene (from A. elongatum (Host) Beuv.), only moderate amount of superoxide anion accumulated on the cell walls of stomatal guard cells and in the infection structures when the fungus penetrated into the substomatal cavity and in mesophyll cells. In plants with the Lr24 gene (from A. elongatum), superoxide anion was detected only around haustoria. Suppression of ROS generation in plants harboring the Lr19 and Lr24 genes did not affect fungus entrance into the substomatal cavity but facilitated penetration of haustoria into the mesophyll cells. At the same time, in the lines with the Lr1 gene (from T. aestivum), cytological examination did not detect O ₂ ⁻ accumulation in plant cells, whereas treatment with verapamil enhanced mycelium development. In all lines, the suppression of oxidative burst slowed the development of hypersensitive response. 3aAgropyron 3aPuccinia recondita 3aTriticum aestivum 3aappressoria 3acalcium 3acalcium channels 3acell walls 3afungi 3agenes 3aguard cells 3ahypersensitive response 3aisogenic lines 3aleaf rust 3alight microscopy 3amesophyll 3amycelium 3astomata 3asuperoxide anion 3atetrazolium 3averapamil 3awheat 0aoxidative burst0 tRussian journal of plant physiology.g2009 Mar., v. 56, no. 2 p.181-189dDordrecht : SP MAIK Nauka/Interperiodicax1021-44377nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1134/S102144370902006X3Available from publisher's Web site  a20090404b20090508c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02778naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002000145245013100165300001800296520130400314650002701618650001401645650000901659650002901668650002501697650002701722650001901749650001701768650002101785650002101806650001901827650001201846650000901858650002601867650001201893650002101905650001301926653001301939653002201952653002301974700002101997773014002018852000902158856008502167930003302252946001102285655001202296IND4395817320221120123323.0071007e200711  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439581732DNAL7 a10.1007/s11274-007-9399-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAl-Zeer, Munir 10aLPS-based conjugate vaccines composed of O-polysaccharide from Pseudomonas aeruginosa IATS 6 and 11 bound to a carrier protein  ap. 1541-1549.  aLipopolysaccharide (LPS) is the major surface antigen of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and elicits protective antibodies in animals.

The conjugates emulsified with MPL adjuvant elicited the highest IgM antibody, followed by Freund. While both MPL and Freund adjuvants elicited high IgG antibody. Good correlation was observed between the IgG and IgM levels with the bactericidal activities of the sera against homologous strains. In addition, immunization of mice with the prepared conjugates emulsified with MPL and Freund adjuvants provided high protection against ten times the LD₅₀ of P. aeruginsoa IATS 6 and 11, which showed a good correlations with the IgG titer. 3aPseudomonas aeruginosa 3aadjuvants 3aalum 3aantibacterial properties 3abovine serum albumin 3acondensation reactions 3across reaction 3aimmunization 3aimmunoglobulin G 3aimmunoglobulin M 3alethal dose 50 3alipid A 3amice 3apolyclonal antibodies 3arabbits 3asurface antigens 3avaccines 0aAdjuvant 0aConjugate vaccine 0aLipopolysaccharide1 aMasoud, Hussein 0 tWorld journal of microbiology & biotechnology.g2007 Nov., v. 23, no. 11 p.1541-1549dDordrecht : Springer Netherlandsx0959-39937nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11274-007-9399-23Available from publisher's Web site  a20071007b20071102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02627naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002800110040001800138100001500156245009800171300001600269520088600285650002801171650002101199650002701220650002501247650002301272650003101295650001501326650001201341650002301353650003201376650004201408650001601450650002201466650001401488650002601502650002901528650001501557650002701572650002801599651001101627651001101638651001801649651001801667651001401685651000901699653001901708653002501727700001601752773008801768852000901856856007801865930003301943945001301976946001301989990002302002655001202025IND2053183120221120103037.0960924e199604  nyu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205318312DNAL7 a86426132pmid7 a10.1007/BF024986382doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVieira, C.10aGeographical variation in insertion site number of retrotransposon 412 in Drosophila simulans  ap. 443-451.  aThe insertion site number of the retrotransposable element 412 was analyzed in natural populations of Drosophila simulans of worldwide origin by in situ hybridization. We observe a gradient in copy number ranging from as high as 23 in Europe to 1-10 in South Africa, while populations in Madagascar and the Indian Islands, which are the cradle of D. simulans, have only 3-7 copies. We find very different copy numbers in some local populations of Australia and the Pacific Islands (with around 60 copies in 1 sample and only 5 in another), suggesting spontaneous transposition bursts in local populations. Such bursts occurring now and then in local natural populations followed by fly migration could lead to the progressive invasion of the entire species by the transposable element mobilized, explaining the gradient in 412 copy number between northern and southern hemispheres. 3aDrosophila melanogaster 3aretrotransposons 3ageographical variation 3apolytene chromosomes 3achromosome mapping 3anucleic acid hybridization 3apopulation 2aAnimals 2aChromosome Mapping 2aChromosomesxultrastructure 2aDrosophilaxclassificationxgenetics. 2aGene Dosage 2aGenetic Variation 2aGeography 2aIn Situ Hybridization 2aMutagenesis, Insertional 2aPopulation 2aRecombination, Genetic 2aRetroelementsxgenetics 3aEurope 3aAfrica 3aNorth America 3aSouth America 3aAustralia 3aAsia 0agenetic change 0achromosomal location1 aBiemont, C.0 tJournal of molecular evolution.g1996 Apr., v. 42, no. 4 p.443-451x0022-28447nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF024986383Available from publisher's Web site  a19961101b19961107c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US  mNon-PubAg articles 7aarticle03164naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002100152245011800173300001200291520157000303650002701873650002001900650002101920650001101941650001501952650001301967650001201980650001201992650002602004650001502030650001602045650001002061650001002071650001602081650001702097650002302114650001702137653001302154653002102167653002602188653002102214653001002235700002202245700001802267700002202285700002102307700002002328773011702348852000902465856009202474930003302566946001102599655001202610IND4401240620221120092723.0080210e200803  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440124062DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-3032.2007.00592.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKNUDSEN, GEIR K.10aDiscrepancy in laboratory and field attraction of apple fruit moth Argyresthia conjugella to host plant volatiles  ap. 1-6.  aApple fruit moth Argyresthia conjugella is a specialist seed predator of rowan Sorbus aucuparia. Large-scale synchronous fluctuation of seed production in rowan (i.e. named masting) drives the apple fruit moth to seek alternative host plants such as apple, during years when rowan berries are not available for oviposition. The role of plant volatile compounds in the attraction of gravid apple fruit moth females is studied in a laboratory wind tunnel. Volatiles from rowan branches with green berries stimulate female moths to fly upwind and to land at the odour source. By contrast, females are not attracted to rowan branches without green berries, and they are not attracted to apple, demonstrating that the chemical stimulus from rowan berries is required for attraction. Attraction to synthetic compounds identified from rowan, anethole and 2-phenyl ethanol confirms the role of plant volatiles in host finding. These two compounds, however, show a discrepant behavioural effect in wind tunnel and field tests. Field traps baited with 2-phenyl ethanol capture female moths but anethole does not produce significant captures. Wind tunnel tests produce the opposite results: moths fly upwind towards the anethole lure, whereas 2-phenyl ethanol is not attractive at all. Wind tunnel attraction to 2-phenyl ethanol is achieved by adding odour from a rowan branch without berries, which is not attractive on its own. This finding demonstrates that interaction with the background odour contributes to the behavioural effect of plant volatile stimuli in the field. 3aArgyresthia conjugella 3aMalus domestica 3aSorbus aucuparia 3aapples 3abait traps 3abranches 3aethanol 3afemales 3afield experimentation 3agranivores 3ahost plants 3amoths 3aodors 3aoviposition 3asmall fruits 3avolatile compounds 3awind tunnels 0aAnethole 0abackground odour 0ahost plant attraction 0a2-phenyl ethanol 0arowan1 aBengtsson, Marie.1 aKOBRO, SVERRE1 aJAASTAD, GUNNHILD1 aHofsvang, Trond.1 aWITZGALL, PETER0 tPhysiological entomology.g2008 Mar., v. 33, no. 1 p.1-6dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0307-69627nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-3032.2007.00592.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20080210b20080301c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03832naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001600145245016200161300001600323500002400339520239600363650003102759650000802790650001102798650001402809650000902823650001302832650001202845650001302857650002102870650002302891650001102914650001602925650001202941650001102953651001102964651002202975700001702997700002103014700001703035700001703052700001703069700001603086700001503102700002403117773009103141852000903232856008503241655001203326IND4416374420221120092643.0090213s2009    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441637442DNAL7 a10.1007/s00382-008-0391-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLaîné, A.10aNorthern hemisphere storm tracks during the last glacial maximum in the PMIP2 ocean-atmosphere coupled models: energetic study, seasonal cycle, precipitation  ap. 593-614.  aIncludes references  aMid-latitude eddies are an important component of the climatic system due to their role in transporting heat, moisture and momentum from the tropics to the poles, and also for the precipitation associated with their fronts, especially in winter. We study northern hemisphere storm-tracks at the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) and their influence on precipitation using ocean-atmosphere general circulation model (OAGCM) simulations from the second phase of the Paleoclimate Modelling Intercomparison Project (PMIP2). The difference with PMIP1 results in terms of sea-surface temperature forcing, fundamental for storm-track dynamics, is large, especially in the eastern North Atlantic where sea-ice extends less to the south in OAGCMs compared to atmospheric-only GCMs. Our analyses of the physics of the eddies are based on the equations of eddy energetics. All models simulate a consistent southeastward shift of the North Pacific storm-track in winter, related to a similar displacement of the jet stream, partly forced by the eddies themselves. Precipitation anomalies are consistent with storm-track changes, with a southeastward displacement of the North Pacific precipitation pattern. The common features of North Atlantic changes in the LGM simulations consist of a thinning of the storm-track in its western part and an amplification of synoptic activity to the southeast, in the region between the Azores Islands and the Iberian Peninsula, which reflects on precipitation. This southeastward extension is related to a similar displacement of the jet, partly forced by the eddies. In the western North Atlantic, the synoptic activity anomalies are at first order related to baroclinic generation term anomalies, but the mean-flow baroclinicity increase due to the presence of the Laurentide ice-sheet is partly balanced by a loss of eddy efficiency to convert energy from the mean flow. Moisture availability in this region is greatly reduced due to more advection of dry polar air by stationary waves, leading to less synoptic-scale latent heat release and hence less precipitation also. In terms of seasonality, the stormy season is shifted later in the year by a few days to a month depending on the season and the model considered. This shift does not directly reflect on the first-order seasonal cycle of precipitation, which also depends on other mechanisms, especially in summer. 3aGeneral Circulation Models 3aair 3aenergy 3aequations 3aheat 3aicebergs 3aislands 3amomentum 3apaleoclimatology 3aseasonal variation 3asummer 3atemperature 3atropics 3awinter 3aAzores 3aIberian Peninsula1 aKageyama, M.1 aSalas-Mélia, D.1 aVoldoire, A.1 aRivière, G.1 aRamstein, G.1 aPlanton, S.1 aTyteca, S.1 aPeterschmitt, J.

Fifteen male Wistar rats were randomly distributed into three groups (n = 5 animals per group): two trypanosome-infected groups (T3 and T5) and uninfected controls (C). The animals were inoculated intraperitoneally with 106 trypanosomes. The blood was collected by cardiac puncture on the 3rd (T3) or 5th day post-infection (T5 and C). Cerebrum and cerebellum were removed for the evaluation of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity. AChE activity was also evaluated in whole blood and butyrylcholinesterase activity (BUChE) in plasma samples. Parasitemia were progressive increase and parasites were observed in the peripheral blood of all infected animals one day post-inoculation. AChE activity was not altered in cerebrum and cerebellum tissues. AChE activity in blood significantly decreased in the T3 and T5 groups (26.63 and 25.86 mU/l mol Hb) compared with the control (37.84 mU/l mol Hb). In addition BUChE activity in plasma was lower in the T3 (7.01 μmol BTC hydrolyzed/h/mL) than the T5 and C groups (9.84 and 12.00 μmol BTC hydrolyzed/h/mL). This study therefore, shows that reductions in the activity of cholinesterase occur in acute infection by T. evansi in rats and this demonstrates an important change occurring in animals infected by the protozoan and may indicate a potential role the enzymes play in the mechanism of disease. 3aTrypanosoma evansi 3aacetylcholinesterase 3ablood 3acerebellum 3acerebrum 3acholinesterase 3aparasitemia 3aparasites 3aparasitology 3arats 3atissues1 aLopes, Sonia Terezinha dos Anjos1 aFranciscato, Carina1 aSilva, Aleksandro Schafer Da1 aTraesel, Carolina Kist1 aSiqueira, Lucas Carvalho1 aPereira, Maria Ester1 aMonteiro, Sílvia Gonzalez1 aMazzanti, Cinthia Melazzo de Andrade0 tExperimental parasitology.g2010 July, v. 125, no. 3 p.251-255dAcademic Pressx0014-48947nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.exppara.2010.01.0243Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03511naa a2200613 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002100145245010400166300001600270520167800286650002201964650002001986650002102006650002002027650002302047650002102070650001602091650001802107650002702125650002402152650001902176650001802195650003302213650002902246650002102275650001102296650002202307650001002329650002202339650000702361650001402368650001602382650002302398650001802421650001602439650002002455651001002475653001802485653001602503653002502519653002702544700002002571700001902591773013702610852000902747856008502756930003302841946001102874655001202885IND4396285420221120061301.0071021e200702  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439628542DNAL7 a10.1007/s11274-006-9206-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRabeh, Saleh A. 10aStudies on bacterioplankton and inhibitory strains of aquatic actinomycetes in Lake Bardawil, Egypt  ap. 167-176.  aLake Bardawil represents a hyper-saline shallow (50-600 cm deep) water basin lying along the northern shore of Sinai. Surface water samples were collected monthly from this lake for physico-chemical and microbiological analysis. Seasonal variations in the averages of temperature, pH and transparency of the tested water samples were determined. Seasonal averages of the total bacterial counts at 22 and 37°C, biovolumes of cells and bacterial biomass of the lake's water at different regions were also determined. In addition to the gram-negative pathogen, Edwardsiella tarda, faecal contamination indicators, total coliforms, faecal coliforms and faecal streptococci were counted in the lake's water samples from various regions during different seasons. The number of actinomycetes per milliliter of the lake's water samples were determined. Fifteen actinomycetes were isolated and screened for their antibacterial activity against E. coli and pathogenic E. tarda isolated from the same water samples. Five isolates of these actinomycetes showed antibacterial activities and nine of them were identified as Streptomyces. The most antibacterially active isolate was subjected to morphological, physiological and biochemical studies and identified as Streptomyces viridiviolaceus. The identified organism exhibited antimicrobial activities against the main indicator of water pollution, E. coli, pathogenic E. tarda, Corynebacterium michiganese B-33, Pseudomonas solanacearum B-3212 and Staphylococcus.

With the required UVA radiation included, Nostoc synthesized three to seven times more scytonemin while fixing nitrogen than when utilizing nitrate or ammonium. A similar increase in scytonemin synthesis occurred when nitrate or ammonium became depleted by growth and Nostoc switched to diazotrophic metabolism with the differentiation of heterocysts. In addition, UVA-exposed cultures grown in medium with both NO₃⁻ and NH₄⁺ synthesized some scytonemin but synthesis increased when NH₄⁺ was depleted and growth had become dependent on NO₃⁻ reduction. Although the mechanism is unclear, these results suggest that the greater the restriction in nitrogen accessibility, the greater the production of scytonemin. Perhaps the entire response may be an interaction between this restriction and a resultant sensitivity to UV radiation that acts as a cue for determining the level of scytonemin synthesis. Scytonemin is a stable UVR screening compound and appears to be synthesized by cyanobacteria as a long-term solution for reducing UVR exposure and damage, but mainly or solely, when metabolic activity is absent. It is likely that during metabolic resurgence, the presence of a dense scytonemin sheath would facilitate the recovery process without the need for active defenses against UV radiation. 3aNostoc punctiforme 3aammonium nitrate 3ametabolism 3anitrogen 3anitrogen fixation 3ascreening 3aultraviolet radiation 2aCulture Media 2aIndolesxmetabolism 2aNitratesxmetabolism 2aNitrogenxmetabolism 2aNitrogen Fixation 2aNostocxgrowth & developmentxmetabolismxradiation effects. 2aPhenolsxmetabolism 2aPigments, Biologicalxmetabolism 2aQuaternary Ammonium Compoundsxmetabolism 2aUltraviolet Rays 0ascytonemin 0anitrogen source1 aCastenholz, Richard W.0 tFEMS microbiology ecology.g2008 Mar., v. 63, no. 3 p.301-308dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0168-64967nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1574-6941.2007.00432.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20080210b20080301c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle01928naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092040001800130100002100148245018600169300001800355500002400373520071200397650001601109650001001125650001701135650002301152650002201175650001601197650001401213650003101227650001501258700002301273700002001296700002001316700002101336773010001357852000901457856008801466655001201554IND4416257720221120052018.0090213s2009    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441625772DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chroma.2008.12.0952doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDe Preter, Vicky10aDevelopment of a screening method to determine the pattern of fermentation metabolites in faecal samples using on-line purge-and-trap gas chromatographic-mass spectrometric analysis  ap. 1476-1483.  aIncludes references  aAn on-line screening method to analyse volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in faecal samples was developed.

The method was successfully applied to the analysis of faecal samples, yielding 135 different volatile organic compounds identified in 11 faecal samples.

Such information is critical for studies on the invasiveness, behavioural ecology, and management of this pest. Phenotypic traits that change over the lifetime of the beetle were investigated (e.g., fresh body weight) as they can indicate changes in adult physiology or fitness of D. v. virgifera. Phenotypic traits that remain stable over the beetle's lifetime were also investigated (e.g., pronotum width, head capsule width, hind tibia length), as they most likely allow detection of genetic differences between populations. Furthermore, phenotypic traits were investigated that may best predict fecundity (e.g., fresh body weight, elytra width) and life span (e.g., elytra length), as these two factors influence the population growth of this highly invasive species. Finally, regression equations are provided for the age-specific oviposition and survival of the long-living D. v. virgifera adults, which may allow researchers to reduce the duration of their bioassays without losing information. 3aDiabrotica virgifera virgifera 3aadults 3abioassays 3abody weight 3acorn 3aelytra 3aequations 3afecundity 3agenetic variation 3ahead 3ainvasive species 3alongevity 3aoviposition 3aphenotype 3apopulation growth 3atibia 3aEurope 3aNorth America1 aToepfer, Stefan1 aKuhlmann, Ulrich0 tEntomologia experimentalis et applicata.g2009 June, v. 131, no. 3 p.254-263dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0013-87037nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1570-7458.2009.00856.x 7aarticle02075naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092040001800130100001600148245008400164300001800248500002400266520095700290650001501247650001701262650002001279650003501299650002401334650001601358650001901374650002201393650002601415650000701441650002401448700001201472700002001484773010001504852000901604856008801613655001201701IND4416256320221123045408.0090213s2009    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441625632DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chroma.2008.12.1002doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNg, Paul K.10aSeparation of protein mixtures using pH-gradient cation-exchange chromatography  ap. 1372-1376.  aIncludes references  aHistorically, separation of a protein mixture after adsorption to a cation-exchange column is effected by alteration in ionic strength. An alternative separation method using pH induced gradient in the range of 4-7.5 was studied. A cation-exchange column with large particle beads containing excessive carboxyls was employed. A pH gradient across the column was generated by a step change at the column entrance using a non-retained buffer system. Consistency and accuracy of pH values in timed intervals were demonstrated in three different batches. In development of the application, we found a correlation coefficient of >0.9 between the elution pH values of six acidic proteins and their isoelectric points. One case study showed the resolution between a monoclonal antibody and non-retained protein species from a protein A column. Another case study showed the feasibility of separating polyethylene glycol conjugated protein from native protein. 3aadsorption 3acase studies 3acation exchange 3acation exchange chromatography 3aconjugated proteins 3acorrelation 3aionic strength 3aisoelectric point 3amonoclonal antibodies 3apH 3apolyethylene glycol1 aHe, Jie1 aSnyder, Mark A.0 tJournal of chromatography.g2009 Feb. 27, v. 1216, no. 9 p.1372-1376dElsevierx0021-96737nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chroma.2008.12.1003Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02879naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001900145245008500164300001600249500001500265520153000280650001101810650001501821650001801836650001601854650001901870650002101889650001101910650002401921650002601945650002101971650001201992650001902004650001102023650001302034650001902047653002102066700001802087700001802105700001702123773012902140852000902269856008502278930003302363946001302396655001202409IND4418742020221123044641.0090403e200904  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441874202DNAL7 a10.1007/s11626-008-9173-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLee, L.

The availability of the trout-derived gill cell line, RTgill-W1, is beginning to make impacts in fish health and toxicology. These cells are available from the American Type Culture Collection as ATCC CRL 2523. The cells have an epithelioid morphology and form tight monolayer sheets that can be used for testing epithelial resistance. The cells can be grown in regular tissue culture surfaces or in transwell membranes in direct contact with water on their apical surfaces. The ability of RTgill-W1 to withstand hypo- and hyper-osmotic conditions and their optimal growth capacity at room temperature, make these cells ideal sentinel models for in vitro aquatic toxicology as well as model systems to study fish gill function and gill diseases. RTgill-W1 support growth of paramyxoviruses and orthomyxoviruses like salmon anemia virus. RTgill-W1 also support growth of Neoparamoeba pemaquidensis, the causative agent of amoebic gill disease. The cells have been used to understand mechanisms of toxicity, ranking the potencies of toxicants, and evaluating the toxicity of environmental samples. These cells are also valuable for high throughput toxicogenomic and toxicoproteomic studies which are easier to achieve with cell lines than with whole organisms. RTgill-W1 cell line could become a valuable complement to whole animal studies and in some cases as gill replacements in aquatic toxicology. 3aanemia 3acomplement 3aecotoxicology 3afish health 3adirect contact 3aOrthomyxoviridae 3amodels 3aambient temperature 3aaquatic invertebrates 3atoxic substances 3aviruses 3aosmoregulation 3asalmon 3atoxicity 3atissue culture 0aroom temperature1 aDayeh, V.

It was found that nutrient solutions with high mixing rates or volume equal to or double that of the total water consumed by the canopy during the conservation period had the most stable EC evolution and minimal pH changes. 3aRosa 3acut flowers 3afloriculture crops 3ahydroponics 3aelectrical conductivity 3apH 3anutrient solutions 3amicroclimate 3atranspiration 3amodel validation 3amathematical models 3afertigation 3acalibration 3awater uptake 0arecirculating hydroponic systems1 aKatsoulas, N.1 aGiaglaras, P.1 aKittas, C.0 tJournal of plant nutrition.g2006, v. 29, no. 9 p.1585-1599dDekkerx0190-41677nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/019041606008489043Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://www.tandf.co.uk/journals/titles/01904167.asp3electronic resource  a20061026b20061102c00000000  aINDd2CTe2006/10/13  aOther US 7aarticle02689naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127072000900145072000900154072000900163072000900172100002200181245008400203300001800287500002400305500001500329520114200344650001901486650001301505650002101518650002601539650001601565650002601581650002101607650001301628650002201641650003501663650001701698650001601715653002701731653001001758700002201768700001701790700002101807773008901828852000901917856008501926856007702011930003302088945002502121946001302146655001202159IND4383961120221123044749.0060929s2006    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438396112DNAL7 a10.1080/019041606008487712doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF600 0aF500 0aF841 0aF2001 aKhoshgoftar, A.H.10aResponses of Wheat Genotypes to Zinc Fertilization Under Saline Soil Conditions  ap. 1543-1556.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aA greenhouse experiment with four bread wheat [Triticum aestivum L.] genotypes, 'Rushan,' 'Kavir,' 'Cross,' and 'Falat,' and a durum wheat [Triticum durum L.] genotype, 'Dur-3,' at two zinc (Zn) rates (0 and 15 mg Zn kg-1 dry soil) and four salinity levels (0, 60, 120, and 180 mM NaCl) was conducted. After 45 d of growth, the shoots were harvested, and Zn, iron (Fe), potassium (K), sodium (Na), and cadmium (Cd) concentrations were determined. In the absence of added Zn, visual Zn deficiency symptoms were observed to be more severe in 'Dur-3' and 'Kavir' than in other genotypes. The effect of Zn deficiency on shoot dry matter was similar to its effect on visual deficiency symptoms, such that shoot growth was most depressed in 'Kavir' and 'Dur-3.' At the 180 mM treatment, Zn fertilization had no effect on shoot dry matter of genotypes. Genotypes with high Zn efficiency had greater shoot Zn content than genotypes with low Zn efficiency. In the absence of added Zn, the Dur-3, and 'Cross' genotypes had the highest and lowest Cd concentrations, respectively. Application of Zn had a positive effect on salt tolerance of plants. 3asalt tolerance 3asalinity 3afertilizer rates 3anutrient availability 3adurum wheat 3anutrient deficiencies 3azinc fertilizers 3agenotype 3aTriticum aestivum 3aTriticum turgidum subsp. durum 3asaline soils 3asalt stress 0afertilizer application 0awheat1 aShariatmadari, H.1 aKarimian, N.1 aKhajehpour, M.R.0 tJournal of plant nutrition.g2006, v. 29, no. 9 p.1543-1556dDekkerx0190-41677nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/019041606008487713Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://www.tandf.co.uk/journals/titles/01904167.asp3electronic resource  a20061026b20061102c00000000  aINDd2CTe2006/10/13  aOther US 7aarticle02329naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092040001800130100001500148245017400163300001800337500002400355520100900379650001201388650001901400650001501419650001901434650005301453650004301506650001401549650003701563650000901600700002101609700002601630700001901656700002001675700002301695700001601718773010001734852000901834856008801843655001201931IND4416258520221123043255.0090213s2009    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441625852DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chroma.2008.12.0872doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMao, Debin10aDetailed analysis of petroleum hydrocarbon attenuation in biopiles by high-performance liquid chromatography followed by comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography  ap. 1524-1527.  aIncludes references  aEnhanced bioremediation of petroleum hydrocarbons in two biopiles was quantified by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) followed by comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography (GCXGC). The attenuation of 34 defined hydrocarbon classes was calculated by HPLC-GCXGC analysis of representative biopile samples at start-up and after 18 weeks of biopile operation. In general, a-cyclic alkanes were most efficiently removed from the biopiles, followed by monoaromatic hydrocarbons. Cycloalkanes and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) were more resistant to degradation. A-cyclic biomarkers farnesane, trimethyl-C13, norpristane, pristane and phytane dropped to only about 10% of their initial concentrations. On the other hand, C29-C31 hopane concentrations remained almost unaltered after 18 weeks of biopile operation, confirming their resistance to biodegradation. They are thus reliable indicators to estimate attenuation potential of petroleum hydrocarbons in biopile processed soils. 3aalkanes 3abiodegradation 3abiomarkers 3abioremediation 3acomprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3apetroleum 3apolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons 3asoil1 aLookman, Richard1 aVan De Weghe, Hendrik1 aVan Look, Dirk1 aVanermen, Guido1 aDe Brucker, Nicole1 aDiels, Ludo0 tJournal of chromatography.g2009 Feb. 27, v. 1216, no. 9 p.1524-1527dElsevierx0021-96737nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chroma.2008.12.0873Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03471naa a2200625 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001800164245017400182300001400356520148000370650002101850650001601871650002501887650001701912650001001929650003301939650001501972650001901987650001202006650001402018650002502032650002602057650002202083650005802105650001802163650004002181650003102221650001402252650002602266653001702292653001602309653001702325653001402342653002802356653002202384700001802406700002002424700002502444700002602469700001802495700002502513700002002538700001902558773011802577852000902695856008502704930003302789946001102822655001202833IND4401529120221123033040.0080217e200603  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440152912DNAL7 a163955562pmid7 a10.1007/s00203-005-0059-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGross, Frank 10aBacterial type III polyketide synthases: phylogenetic analysis and potential for the production of novel secondary metabolites by heterologous expression in pseudomonads  ap. 28-38.  aType III polyketide synthases (PKS) were regarded as typical for plant secondary metabolism before they were found in microorganisms recently. Due to microbial genome sequencing efforts, more and more type III PKS are found, most of which of unknown function. In this manuscript, we report a comprehensive analysis of the phylogeny of bacterial type III PKS and report the expression of a type III PKS from the myxobacterium Sorangium cellulosum in pseudomonads. There is no precedent of a secondary metabolite that might be biosynthetically correlated to a type III PKS from any myxobacterium. Additionally, an inactivation mutant of the S. cellulosum gene shows no physiological difference compared to the wild-type strain which is why these type III PKS are assumed to be “silent” under the laboratory conditions administered. One type III PKS (SoceCHS1) was expressed in different Pseudomonas sp. after the heterologous expression in Escherichia coli failed. Cultures of recombinant Pseudomonas sp. harbouring SoceCHS1 turned red upon incubation and the diffusible pigment formed was identified as 2,5,7-trihydroxy-1,4-naphthoquinone, the autooxidation product of 1,3,6,8-tetrahydroxynaphthalene. The successful heterologous production of a secondary metabolite using a gene not expressed under administered laboratory conditions provides evidence for the usefulness of our approach to activate such secondary metabolite genes for the production of novel metabolites. 3aEscherichia coli 3aPseudomonas 3aSorangium cellulosum 3aautoxidation 3agenes 3aheterologous gene expression 3ametabolism 3amicroorganisms 3amutants 3aphylogeny 3apolyketide synthases 3asecondary metabolites 3asequence analysis 2aAcyltransferasesxbiosynthesisxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aBase Sequence 2aMyxococcalesxenzymologyxgenetics. 2aNaphthoquinonesxchemistry 2aPhylogeny 2aPseudomonasxgenetics 0aType III PKS 0aSilent gene 0aPseudomonads 0aFlaviolin 0aHeterologous Expression 0aGenome sequencing1 aLuniak, Nora 1 aPerlova, Olena 1 aGaitatzis, Nikolaos 1 aJenke-Kodama, Holger 1 aGerth, Klaus 1 aGottschalk, Daniela 1 aDittmann, Elke 1 aMüller, Rolf.0 tArchives of microbiology.g2006 Mar., v. 185, no. 1 p.28-38dBerlin/Heidelberg : Springer-Verlagx0302-89337nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00203-005-0059-33Available from publisher's Web site  a20080218b20080301c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02171naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001700145245012700162300001600289500002400305520095800329650002601287650003101313650001401344650001501358650001601373650001201389650001301401650002101414650001201435650001501447650001901462700001801481700001901499700001701518700001901535700001301554773010001567852000901667856008501676655001201761IND4416672620221123023338.0090220s2009    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441667262DNAL7 a10.1007/s00203-008-0454-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCao, Huijuan10aComplex quorum-sensing regulatory systems regulate bacterial growth and symbiotic nodulation in Mesorhizobium tianshanense  ap. 283-289.  aIncludes references  aLuxR/LuxI-type quorum-sensing systems have been shown to be important for symbiotic interactions between a number of rhizobium species and host legumes. In this study, we found that different isolates of Mesorhizobium tianshanense, a moderately-growing Rhizobium that forms nodules on a number of types of licorice plants, produces several different N-acyl homoserine lactone-like molecules. In M. tianshanense CCBAU060A, we performed a genetic screen and identified a network of regulatory components including a set of LuxI/LuxR-family regulators as well as a MarR-family regulator that is required for quorum-sensing regulation. Furthermore, compared with the wild-type strains, quorum-sensing deficient mutants showed a reduced growth rate and were defective in nodule formation on their host plant Glycyrrhiza uralensis. These data suggest that different M. tianshanense strains may use diverse quorum-sensing systems to regulate symbiotic process. 3aGlycyrrhiza uralensis 3aMesorhizobium tianshanense 3aRhizobium 3ahomoserine 3ahost plants 3alegumes 3alicorice 3amicrobial growth 3amutants 3anodulation 3aquorum sensing1 aYang, Menghua1 aZheng, Huiming1 aZhang, Jiang1 aZhong, Zengtao1 aZhu, Jun0 tArchives of microbiology.g2009 Mar., v. 191, no. 3 p.283-289dSpringer-Verlagx0302-89337nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00203-008-0454-73Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02551naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004000092040001800132072000900150072000900159100001900168245012400187300001600311500002400327500001500351520113100366650002101497650000901518650002001527650001801547650001301565650002401578650003301602650001101635650000701646650001501653650001501668650001501683650001101698653001701709653001401726700001401740700001401754700001601768773009301784852000901877856009001886930003301976945002502009946001102034655001202045IND4407722720221123023242.0080712e20081201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440772272DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2008.04.0372doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ206 0aQ1061 aWang, Lingzhao10aExtraction of pepsin-soluble collagen from grass carp (Ctenopharyngodon idella) skin using an artificial neural network  ap. 683-686.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aA multilayer feed-forward neural network trained with an error back-propagation algorithm was used to evaluate the effects of pepsin amount, reaction time and pH on the yield of pepsin-soluble collagen. A positive correlation was observed between the yield and the amount of pepsin and also the reaction time. The yield increased with an increase of pH to nearly 3, thereafter yield decreased. The trained network gave a regression coefficient (r ²) of 0.97 and a mean squared error (MSE) of 0.21, which implied a good generalisation of the network. Based on the genetic algorithm, the optimal extraction conditions to obtain the highest yield were determined to be pH 3.4, 53.3unit/mg of pepsin and 35.2h. The predicted yield value was 30.3%. As the estimated optimal extraction conditions were used in the actual preparation of the pepsin-soluble collagen, the yield was measured experimentally to be 29.3±0.8%, which was not significantly different (p >0.05) from the predicted value. The response surface plots showed the yield of pepsin-soluble collagen as a function of two factors under various extraction conditions. 3aapplication rate 3acarp 3aneural networks 3afish products 3acollagen 3aregression analysis 3aresponse surface methodology 3ayields 3apH 3aextraction 3asolubility 3aalgorithms 3apepsin 0aoptimization 0afish skin1 aYang, Bao1 aWang, Rui1 aDu, Xiuqiao0 tFood chemistry.g2008 Dec. 1, v. 111, no. 3 p.683-686dElsevier Sciencex0308-81467nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2008.04.0373Available from publisher's Web site  a20080915b20081011c00000000  aINDd2CTe2008/08/29  aNon-US 7aarticle02706naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100002100171245010600192300001800298500002400316520121500340650001401555650002401569650002601593650002601619650001201645650001401657650001401671650001501685650005201700650002001752650002701772650002301799650002401822650002601846650002001872650001301892651001601905651001801921651001601939651001801955700002201973700002101995700002402016773009602040852000902136856005502145655001202200IND4444993120221123023215.0101105s2010    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444499312DNAL7 a206026282pmid7 a10.1111/j.1461-0248.2010.01508.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWood, Spencer A.10aOrganismal traits are more important than environment for species interactions in the intertidal zone  ap. 1160-1171.  aIncludes references  aEcology Letters (2010) 13: 1160-1171 ABSTRACT: Species interactions come in a variety of forms, from weak to strong, and negative or positive, each with unique consequences for local community structure. However, interactions depend on several biotic, abiotic and scale‐dependent variables that make their magnitude and direction difficult to predict. Here, we quantify the relative impacts of multiple factors on species interactions for a diverse array of intertidal organisms, using our own experiments across a range of environments in New Zealand and North America. Interaction strengths are related to organism body size and trophic level, but are relatively insensitive to environmental conditions associated with tidal height. Although species at higher trophic levels exert stronger per‐capita effects on other taxa, their population‐level impacts are equivalent to basal trophic groups. This indicates that interaction intensity is largely based on requirements for resources, such as food or space, that follow allometric scaling rules. These results demonstrate the potential to predict interactivity based on simple criteria without detailed information on particular species or communities. 3abody size 3acommunity structure 3aenvironmental factors 3atrophic relationships 2aAnimals 2aBody Size 2aEcosystem 2aFood Chain 2aInvertebratesxanatomy & histologyxphysiology. 2aOceans and Seas 2aPhaeophytaxphysiology 2aPopulation Density 2aPopulation Dynamics 2aStress, Physiological 2aWater Movements 2aWetlands 3aNew Zealand 3aNorth America 0aNew Zealand 0aNorth America1 aLilley, Stacie A.1 aSchiel, David R.1 aShurin, Jonathan B.0 tEcology letters.g2010, v. 13, no. 9 p.1160-1171dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx1461-023X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1461-0248.2010.01508.x 7aarticle02899naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100006100152245009000213520144700303592002801750650003001778650001301808650001701821650002201838650002801860650001601888650000901904650001501913650002401928653001701952653001601969653001401985653001601999653001202015700006102027700006202088700002402150700005702174700002102231773011702252856008702369852000902456655001202465IND60783761620221120110338.0220824e20220915xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078376162DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enconman.2022.1160332doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHalilovic, Smajil1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2024-820110aWell layout optimization for groundwater heat pump systems using the adjoint approach  aGroundwater heat pump systems cause thermal anomalies in the aquifer that can impact upon downstream systems and reduce their efficiency. Therefore, it is important to optimally position the extraction and injection wells of such systems to avoid negative interactions and maximize the thermal potential of the aquifer. This paper presents a new method to determine optimal well layouts of groundwater heat pumps using the adjoint approach, which is an efficient way to solve the underlying PDE-constrained optimization problem. An integral part of the method is the numerical groundwater simulation, which here is based on the finite element method. In addition, a multi-start initialization strategy is introduced in an attempt to better reach the global optimum. The method is applied to a real case study with 10 groundwater heat pumps, i.e. 20 wells, and two optimization scenarios with different natural groundwater temperatures. In both scenarios, the optimization method successfully determines a well layout that maximizes groundwater temperatures at all extraction wells. Comparing the results from these scenarios demonstrates that hydro-geological conditions can have a significant impact on the optimal well layout. The proposed method is equally applicable to systems with multiple extraction and injection wells and can be extended to various other shallow geothermal applications, such as combined heating and cooling systems.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadministrative management 3aaquifers 3acase studies 3aenergy conversion 3afinite element analysis 3agroundwater 3aheat 3aheat pumps 3asystem optimization 0aOptimization 0aWell layout 0aHeat pump 0aGroundwater 0aAdjoint1 aBöttcher, Fabian1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3954-03491 aKramer, Stephan C.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9193-50921 aPiggott, Matthew D.1 aZosseder, Kai1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5317-33681 aHamacher, Thomas0 tEnergy conversion and management.g2022 Sept. 15, v. 268 p.116033-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11831x0196-89047nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enconman.2022.1160333Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04107naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100005500139245017700194300001600371500002000387520228600407592002802693650002602721650001702747650002102764650002602785650002602811650001302837650001102850650001002861650002302871650001302894650001102907650003102918650001402949650003002963650001802993650003703011650001503048650002103063650002203084650001403106650002003120650001503140650001303155650001103168651001103179700001503190700001803205700001703223700001903240700001703259700001603276773013103292856007303423852000903496655001203505IND60602915620221120150806.0180711e201808  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060291562DNAL7 a10.1111/lam.129932doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJanecko, N.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7396-996910aOccurrence of plasmid‐mediated quinolone resistance genes in Escherichia coli and Klebsiella spp. recovered from Corvus brachyrhynchos and Corvus corax roosting in Canada  ap. 130-135.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe spread of antimicrobial resistance from human activity derived sources to natural habitats implicates wildlife as potential vectors of antimicrobial resistance transfer. Wild birds, including corvid species can disseminate mobile genetic resistance determinants through faeces. This study aimed to determine the occurrence of plasmid‐mediated quinolone resistance (PMQR) genes in Escherichia coli and Klebsiella spp. isolates obtained from winter roosting sites of American crows (Corvus brachyrhynchos) and common ravens (Corvus corax) in Canada. Faecal swabs were collected at five roosting sites across Canada. Selective media isolation and multiplex PCR screening was utilized to identify PMQR genes followed by gene sequencing, pulse‐field gel electrophoresis and multilocus sequence typing to characterize isolates. Despite the low prevalence of E. coli containing PMQR (1·3%, 6/449), qnrS1, qnrB19, qnrC, oqxAB and aac(6′)‐Ib‐cr genes were found in five sequence types (ST), including E. coli ST 131. Conversely, one isolate of Klebsiella pneumoniae contained the plasmid‐mediated resistance gene qnrB19. Five different K. pneumoniae STs were identified, including two novel types. The occurrence of PMQR genes and STs of public health significance in E. coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae recovered from corvids gives further evidence of the anthropogenic derived dissemination of antimicrobial resistance determinants at the human activity‐wildlife‐environment interface. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: This study examined large corvids as possible vector species for the dissemination of antimicrobial resistance in indicator and pathogenic bacteria as a means to assess the anthropogenic dissemination of plasmid‐mediated quinolone resistance (PMQR) genes. Although rare, PMQR genes were found among corvid populations across Canada. The clinically important Escherichia coli strain ST131 containing aac(6′)‐Ib‐cr gene along with a four‐class phenotypic antimicrobial resistance (AMR) pattern as well as one Klebsiella pneumoniae strain containing a qnrB19 gene were identified in one geographical location. Corvids are a viable vector for the circulation of PMQR genes and clinically important clones in wide‐ranging environments.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCorvus brachyrhynchos 3aCorvus corax 3aEscherichia coli 3aKlebsiella pneumoniae 3aantibiotic resistance 3abacteria 3aclones 3afeces 3agenetic resistance 3ahabitats 3ahumans 3amultilocus sequence typing 3aphenotype 3apolymerase chain reaction 3apublic health 3apulsed-field gel electrophoresis 3aquinolones 3aresistance genes 3aroosting behavior 3ascreening 3aselective media 3awild birds 3awildlife 3awinter 3aCanada1 aHalova, D.1 aJamborova, I.1 aPapousek, I.1 aMasarikova, M.1 aDolejska, M.1 aLiterak, I.0 tLetters in applied microbiology.g2018 Aug., v. 67, no. 2 p.130-135dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl37648x0266-82547nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/lam.129933Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03982naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245013900169300001600308500001500324520220300339592002802542650001502570650002402585650001602609650002902625650001102654650002402665650002102689650002602710650002502736650001202761650001902773650001902792650001502811650002902826650001202855650001502867651001002882653001102892653002802903653002802931653002002959653001802979653002402997653002503021700001903046700001403065700001803079700001403097700001403111700001403125700001703139700001703156773010003173856008603273852000903359655001203368IND60527099520221118042027.0190412e201601  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052709952DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecolind.2015.08.0362doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Ren-Min10aComparison of boosted regression tree and random forest models for mapping topsoil organic carbon concentration in an alpine ecosystem  ap. 870-878.  a2019-12-06  aSoil organic carbon (SOC) plays an important role in soil fertility and carbon sequestration, and a better understanding of the spatial patterns of SOC is essential for soil resource management. In this study, we used boosted regression tree (BRT) and random forest (RF) models to map the distribution of topsoil organic carbon content at the northeastern edge of the Tibetan Plateau in China. A set of 105 soil samples and 12 environmental variables (including topography, climate and vegetation) were analyzed. The performance of the models was evaluated using a 10-fold cross-validation procedure. Maps of the mean values and standard deviations of SOC were generated to illustrate model variability and uncertainty. The results indicate that the BRT and RF models exhibited very similar performance and yielded similar predicted distributions of SOC. The two models explained approximately 70% of the total SOC variability. The BRT and RF models robustly predicted the SOC at low observed SOC values, whereas they underestimated high observed SOC values. This underestimation may have been caused by biased distributions of soil samples in the SOC space. Vegetation-related variables were assigned the highest importance in both models, followed by climate and topography. Both models produced spatial distribution maps of SOC that were closely related to vegetation cover. The SOC content predicted by the BRT model was clearly higher than that of the RF model in areas with greater vegetation cover because the contributions of vegetation-related variables in the two models (65% and 43%, respectively) differed significantly. The predicted SOC content increased from the northwestern to the southeastern part of the study area, average values produced by the BRT and RF models were 27.3gkg−1 and 26.6gkg−1, respectively. We conclude that the BRT and RF methods should be calibrated and compared to obtain the best prediction of SOC spatial distribution in similar regions. In addition, vegetation variables, including those obtained from remote sensing imagery, should be taken as the main environmental indicators and explicitly included when generating SOC maps in Alpine environments.  aPublisher supplied data 3atopography 3asoil organic carbon 3auncertainty 3asoil resource management 3amodels 3aregression analysis 3avegetation cover 3aenvironmental factors 3acarbon sequestration 3atopsoil 3asoil fertility 3aremote sensing 3aecosystems 3aenvironmental indicators 3aclimate 3aprediction 3aChina 0acarbon 0aEnvironmental variables 0aBoosted regression tree 0aTibetan Plateau 0aRandom forest 0aSoil organic carbon 0aDigital soil mapping1 aZhang, Gan-Lin1 aLiu, Feng1 aLu, Yuan-Yuan1 aYang, Fan1 aYang, Fei1 aYang, Min1 aZhao, Yu-Guo1 aLi, De-Cheng0 tEcological indicators.g2016 Jan., v. 60 p.870-878dElsevier LtdwJournal:6196x1470-160X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2015.08.0363Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02452naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001600140245010000156300001800256500001900274520120200293592002801495650001501523650002601538650001401564650003601578650002301614650002001637650001301657650001101670650001401681650001501695650002201710700001501732700001501747700001701762700001701779700001701796773013401813856007401947852000902021655001202030IND60730998620221123043534.0210315e20210315xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073099862DNAL7 a10.1039/d0cs00447b2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Jian10aRecent advances in chelation-assisted site- and stereoselective alkenyl C–H functionalization  ap. 3263-3314.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aOlefinic C–H functionalization represents an atom- and step economic approach to valuable olefin derivatives from simpler ones, but controlling the selectivity remains a challenge. Remarkable progress has been made in the site-selective C–H functionalization of arenes and alkanes, but there are still limited examples of selective C–H functionalization of olefins presumably due to the lability and easy decomposition of the alkenyl moiety. Chelation-assisted C–H activation represents an efficient protocol for site- and stereo-selective construction of carbon–carbon and carbon–heteroatom bonds. This review highlights recent advances in vicinal- and geminal-group-directed olefinic C–H functionalization, including alkenylation, arylation, alkynylation, alkylation, halogenation, silylation, cyanation and annulation by the formation of exo-/endo-metallocycles. In particular, geminal-group-directed C–H functionalization is covered for the first time, as well as distal-selective alkenyl C–H functionalization under palladium/norbornene cooperative catalysis, which provides novel disconnections in retrosynthetic analysis and represents the future trend in green chemistry.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalkylation 3aaromatic hydrocarbons 3aarylation 3acarbon-hydrogen bond activation 3acatalytic activity 3agreen chemistry 3amoieties 3aolefin 3apalladium 3asilylation 3astereoselectivity1 aLu, Xiunan1 aShen, Cong1 aXu, Liangyao1 aDing, Liyuan1 aZhong, Guofu0 tChemical Society reviews.g2021 Mar. 15, v. 50, no. 5 p.3263-3314dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:20471x1460-47447nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d0cs00447b3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01632naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100001200142245007900154300001600233520044500249592002800694650001800722650002100740650001700761650001000778651001000788653001500798653001100813653001600824653002100840653001700861700001600878700002000894700001300914700001700927700001800944700001800962700001600980773012800996856007701124852000901201655001201210IND60594397520221118012309.0180625e201803  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059439752DNAL7 a10.1653/024.101.01272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, You10aFirst Record of Euplatypus parallelus (Coleoptera: Curculionidae) in China  ap. 141-143.  aEuplatypus parallelus (Coleoptera: Curculionidae) is a neotropical ambrosia beetle that that is rapidly spreading around the world.

Efficient, low-cost, safe and selective hydrogen generation from chemical storage materials remains challenging, however. In this Review article, an overview of the recent achievements is provided, addressing the topic of nanocatalysis of hydrogen production from liquid-phase hydrogen storage materials including metal-boron hydrides, borane–nitrogen compounds, and liquid organic hydrides. The state-of-the-art catalysts range from high-performance nanocatalysts based on noble and non-noble metal nanoparticles (NPs) to emerging single-atom catalysts. Key aspects that are discussed include insights into the dehydrogenation mechanisms, regenerations from the spent liquid chemical hydrides, and tandem reactions using the in situ generated hydrogen. Finally, challenges, perspectives, and research directions for this area are envisaged.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclean energy 3adehydrogenation 3ahydrogen 3ahydrogen production 3aliquids 3ananocatalysts1 aAstruc, D.q(Didier),0 tChemical Society reviews.g2021 Mar. 15, v. 50, no. 5 p.3437-3484dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:20471x1460-47447nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d0cs00515k3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03112naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001900153245013200172300001800304520168000322592002802002650001302030650002302043650002702066650001402093650001302107650001902120650003702139650002502176650000902201650002002210653001502230653001302245653003102258653001602289653002302305653002502328700001902353700002202372700001902394700002002413773012402433856008802557852000902645655001202654IND60615421320221118162447.0201125e20180501xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061542132DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2017.12.0152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLarsson, Maria10aOccurrence and leachability of polycyclic aromatic compounds in contaminated soils: Chemical and bioanalytical characterization  ap. 1476-1484.  aAn important concern regarding sites contaminated with polycyclic aromatic compounds (PACs) is the risk of groundwater contamination by release of the compounds from soils. The goal of this study was to investigate the occurrence and leachability of 77 PACs including polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and heterocyclic aromatic compounds (NSO-PACs) among total aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) agonists in soils from historical contaminated sites. A novel approach combining chemical and bioanalytical methods in combination with characterization of leachability by use of a column leaching test was used. Similar profiles of relative concentrations of PACs were observed in all soils, with parent PAHs accounting for 71 to 90% of total concentrations in soils. Contribution of oxy-PAHs, alkyl-PAHs and N-PACs ranged from 2 to 9%, 3 to 9% and 1 to 14%, respectively. Although the contributions of groups of PACs were small, some compounds were found in similar or greater concentrations than parent PAHs. Leachable fractions of 77 PACs from soils were small and ranged from 0.002 to 0.54%. Polar PACs were shown to be more leachable than parent PAHs. The contribution of analyzed PACS to overall AhR-mediated activities in soils and leachates suggests presence of other AhR agonists in soils, and a potential risk. Only a small fraction of AhR agonists was available in soils, indicating an overestimation of the risk if only total initial concentrations in soils would be considered in risk assessment. The results of the study strongly support that focus on 16US EPA PAHs may result in inadequate assessment of risk and hazard of PACs in complex environmental samples.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagonists 3aanalytical methods 3aheterocyclic compounds 3aleachates 3aleaching 3apolluted soils 3apolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons 3apolycyclic compounds 3arisk 3arisk assessment 0aAlkyl-PAHs 0aOxy-PAHs 0aNSO-heterocyclic compounds 0aAh receptor 0aH4IIE-luc bioassay 0aColumn leaching test1 aLam, Monika M.1 avan Hees, Patrick1 aGiesy, John P.1 aEngwall, Magnus0 tScience of the total environment.g2018 May 01, v. 622-623 p.1476-1484dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2017.12.0153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03204naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100005700150245015800207300001400365520140900379592002801788650002401816650001101840650002201851650001801873650002501891650001401916650001601930650001001946650001601956650001701972650001201989650002202001650001102023650002802034650001202062650001402074650001002088650001002098650001002108650001302118650001302131650000802144653002102152653002302173653001302196653002702209653001602236700001302252700001302265700001402278700001602292700001702308700001602325700002402341773011902365856008502484852000902569655001202578IND60525179820221118223816.0190318e201607  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052517982DNAL7 a10.1016/j.pestbp.2015.12.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCai, Hongjiao1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6960-358510aEffects of tea saponin on growth and development, nutritional indicators, and hormone titers in diamondback moths feeding on different host plant species  ap. 53-59.  aThe diamondback moth (DBM) is an important worldwide pest. This insect has been studied for several decades; however, its control remains problematic. Numerous chemical insecticides have become ineffective and chemical residues constitute an important problem. In the present study, we determined the mortality of 3rd instar DBM larvae feeding on three different host plant species and exposed to various concentrations of tea saponin (TS). In addition, we evaluated growth and development parameters, nutritional indicators, and juvenile hormone (JH) and molting hormone (MH) titers in 2nd instar larvae exposed to LC20 and LC50 doses of TS. We found that treatment of DBM larvae with LC20 and LC50 doses of TS led to lower growth rates, decreased feed consumption, reduced frass production, lower pupal weights, reduced percentage pupation, slower adult emergence percentages, and diminished fecundity, but prolonged durations of the larval and pupal periods. The efficiency of conversion of ingested and digested food increased, but the approximate digestibility did not differ significantly between treatments and controls. JH and MH titers were higher after TS treatment; these increases varied according to the host species and TS concentration. Our results indicate that TS represents a potential new alternative insecticide based on its natural origin, low cost, and minimum environmental impact.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPlutella xylostella 3aadults 3achemical residues 3adigestibility 3aenvironmental impact 3afecundity 3afeed intake 3afrass 3ahost plants 3ainsecticides 3ainstars 3ajuvenile hormones 3alarvae 3alethal concentration 50 3amolting 3amortality 3amoths 3apests 3apupae 3apupation 3asaponins 3atea 0aDiamondback moth 0aGrowth development 0aHormones 0aNutritional indicators 0aTea saponin1 aBai, Yan1 aWei, Hui1 aLin, Shuo1 aChen, Yixin1 aTian, Houjun1 aGu, Xiaojun1 aMurugan, Kadarkarai0 tPesticide biochemistry and physiology.g2016 July, v. 131 p.53-59dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl1414x0048-35757nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.pestbp.2015.12.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02250naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100005900151245011100210300001600321520085000337592002801187650002201215650002501237650002601262650002301288650002201311650001201333650003001345650001901375650002801394651001001422653003701432653002501469653003501494653004701529653002801576700001601604700001301620773010001633856008601733852000901819655001201828IND60527099920221118042044.0190412e201601  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052709992DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecolind.2015.08.0402doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMiao, Cheng-lin1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6058-380514aThe studies of ecological environmental quality assessment in Anhui Province based on ecological footprint  ap. 879-883.  aUnder the dual pressures of the socio-economic development and the increase in population density, the ecological environmental quality issues in Anhui Province have become increasingly prominent, which seriously handicap the sustainable development of regional economy, and it is more important to evaluate ecological environmental quality.

Synthetically, these compounds are important synthons that offer an important platform for the construction of biologically/medicinally significant compounds with two or more stereocenters. This Review comprehensively compiles the diverse catalytic processes involving the enantioselective transformations of oxa- and azabicyclic alkenes. It has been organized according to reaction type, including asymmetric ring opening (ARO) reactions, hydrofunctionalizations, cycloadditions and C–H activation reactions. The ARO section has been subdivided based on the type of nucleophiles employed, and further subdivided based on the metal used, with a separate topic dedicated to asymmetric ring-opening metathesis. Lastly, the presentation of each method/group of reactions is accompanied by concise discussions on their advantages and limitations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLewis bases 3aalkenes 3acarbon-hydrogen bond activation 3aenantioselectivity1 aYen, Andy1 aLautens, M.q(Mark),1 aGuiry, Patrick J.0 tChemical Society reviews.g2021 Mar. 15, v. 50, no. 5 p.3013-3093dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:20471x1460-47447nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d0cs00702a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02551naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094024002200133024001900155040001800174100002300192245012000215300001600335506007600351520128700427592002801714506003701742650001901779650001101798650000801809650001501817650001101832650002301843650001101866650001701877650001001894700003501904700002201939773009801961856008502059852000902144655001202153IND60086059020221207092951.0141101e20111024xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008605902DNAL7 a10.1016/j.physbeh.2011.07.0092doi7 aPMC34944032pmcid7 a218024372pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStanton, Steven J.10aSeasonal variation of salivary testosterone in men, normally cycling women, and women using hormonal contraceptives  ap. 804-808.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aHumans' endogenous testosterone concentrations vary over a number of temporal scales, with little known about variation longer than monthly cycles. Past studies of seasonal or circannual variation have principally used male participants and have produced inconsistent results. Thus, little is known about how testosterone concentrations fluctuate throughout the year, whether such variation differs between men and women, and whether there are influences of hormonal contraceptive use. The present study collected saliva samples from a large sample (N=718) of men and women, each collected at one time point within a relatively uniform distribution over a full calendar year. Both men and normally-cycling women displayed seasonal variation in salivary testosterone concentrations, such that testosterone concentrations are maximal in the fall and minimal in the summer. Notably, normally-cycling women had testosterone concentrations that were over 100% greater at their maximum in fall compared to their minimum in summer. Women using hormonal contraceptives not only had consistently lower endogenous testosterone concentrations, but also showed a flatter seasonal testosterone profile. The implications for studies of psychology and human behavioral endocrinology are discussed.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3acontraceptives 3ahumans 3amen 3apsychology 3asaliva 3aseasonal variation 3asummer 3atestosterone 3awomen1 aMullette-Gillman, O'Dhaniel A.1 aHuettel, Scott A.0 tPhysiology & behavior.g2011 Oct. 24, v. 104, no. 5 p.804-808dElsevier Inc.x0031-93847nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.physbeh.2011.07.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02170naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002000140245007000160300001800230520095300248592002801201650001101229650002101240650003401261650002401295650002001319650001301339650001101352700002201363700002101385700002401406700002401430700001701454700002201471700001701493700002001510700002101530773012501551856007501676852000901751655001201760IND60778297720221119023116.0220524e20220523xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077829772DNAL7 a10.1039/d1gc04709d2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShang, Yuanyuan10aSustainable NaAlH₄ production from recycled automotive Al alloy  ap. 4153-4163.  aTo reduce the carbon footprint associated with the production of hydrogen storage materials and to reduce their cost, we pursue the possibility of obtaining high-quality hydride-based materials from industrial metals waste.

The hydrogen storage properties of the material obtained by ball milling NaH and DIN-GDAlSi10Mg(Cu) under a hydrogen atmosphere were comprehensively explored via a broad range of experimental techniques, e.g. volumetric analysis, ex situ X-ray diffraction (XRD), in situ synchrotron radiation powder X-ray diffraction (SR-PXD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and differential thermal analysis (DTA).

In a previous work, we found that maternal α-tocopherol supplementation affects PKC-mediated cellular signaling and hippocampal synaptic plasticity in developing brain; the latter effect persists in adulthood. Here, adult rats maternally exposed to supranutritional doses of α-tocopherol were evaluated for Contextual Fear Conditioning and spatial learning in Morris Water Maze, two different hippocampus-dependent learning tasks. Moreover, anxiety, spontaneous activity, and explorative drive were also evaluated as factors potentially affecting learning performance. Treated rats showed a different behavior with respect to controls: performance in Contextual Fear Conditioning was improved, while spatial learning tested in Morris Water Maze, was impaired. The improvement of fear response was not ascribable to differences in anxiety level and/or spontaneous activity; thus it appears to be a specific effect of α-tocopherol overloading during brain development. On the contrary, the impaired performance in Morris Water Maze exhibited by treated rats can be in part explained by their enhanced explorative drive. Although extrapolation from rats to humans is difficult, a caveat in assuming supranutritional doses of vitamin E in pregnancy arises from this study.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadulthood 3aadults 3aalpha-tocopherol 3aanxiety 3abrain 3afearfulness 3ahumans 3alearning 3anutrient intake 3apregnancy 3aprogeny 3arats1 aCiuffoli, Stefano1 aLattanzi, Davide1 aMinelli, Andrea1 aBucherelli, Corrado1 aBaldi, E.,1 aBetti, Michele1 aCuppini, Riccardo0 tPhysiology & behavior.g2011 Oct. 24, v. 104, no. 5 p.809-815dElsevier Inc.x0031-93847nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.physbeh.2011.07.0263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03911naa a2200637 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002100150245011700171300001200288520212700300592002802427650001202455650001102467650002002478650001402498650001802512650001702530650001702547650001002564650002502574650002902599650002102628650000902649650001402658650000902672650001102681650001002692650001602702650000902718651001102727651001402738653002202752653001602774653001402790653001702804653001302821700002302834700001902857700002002876700001802896700001802914700002502932700002102957700002202978700001803000700001503018700002203033773011203055856008503167852000903252655001203261IND60542521120221120120030.0190403e20140215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054252112DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foreco.2013.11.0342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aToriyama, Jumpei10aEstimation of fuel mass and its loss during a forest fire in peat swamp forests of Central Kalimantan, Indonesia  ap. 1-8.  aTropical swamp forests growing on peatlands are exposed to various risks of deforestation. To assess the greenhouse gases (GHG) emission from the deforested tropical peatlands, the amount of carbon released during a forest fire needs to be accounted for. The establishment of a fuel mass data set based on a field-based approach is essential to reduce the uncertainty in estimating GHG emissions during forest fires. We estimated the fuel mass (both living and deadwood) in tropical peat swamp forests and its loss during the fire event in 2009 in Central Kalimantan, Indonesia. We also examined the relationship between the forest structure and the burning process by comparing the distribution of stem diameter in burnt and unburnt areas using a fallen wood simulation. We selected two types of peat swamp forests, mature forest and regenerated forest following a fire in 1997/98, and their neighboring burnt areas. The mean fuel mass values in mature and regenerated forest were 319.7 and 131.5Mgha−1, respectively. In burnt areas of mature and regenerated forest, the mean fuel mass values were 235.8 and 89.0Mgha−1, respectively, which corresponded to 73.8% and 67.7% of the values of unburnt areas, respectively. The fuel mass in burnt area comprised mainly solid deadwood. Due to the large amount of deadwood left on the ground, the estimated GHG emissions after the forest fire were larger than those during the forest fire in both forest types. The regenerated forest, which was dominated by small trees and contained a small stock of deadwood, was considered to produce a large amount of solid deadwood during the forest fire. In contrast, the mature forest, which contained many large standing trees and large amounts of deadwood, experienced a high-intensity fire over a long duration time, resulting in surface or deeply burnt deadwood. The development of a simple method to tally the surviving large trees in the burnt area (i.e., designing a study plot with a nested structure for different-sized trees) might reduce uncertainties in the estimation of fuel mass and GHG emissions in future forest fires.  aPublisher supplied data 3aburning 3acarbon 3adata collection 3adead wood 3adeforestation 3aforest fires 3aforest types 3afuels 3afuels (fire ecology) 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3agreenhouse gases 3apeat 3apeatlands 3arisk 3aswamps 3atrees 3auncertainty 3awood 3aBorneo 3aIndonesia 0aPeat swamp forest 0aForest fire 0aFuel mass 0aTree biomass 0aDeadwood1 aTakahashi, Tomoaki1 aNishimura, Sen1 aSatō, Tamotsu,1 aMonda, Yukako1 aSaito, Hideki1 aAwaya, Y.q(Yoshio),1 aLimin, Suwido H.1 aSusanto, Agung R.1 aDarma, Fetria1 aKrisyoyo, 1 aKiyono, Yoshiyuki0 tForest ecology and management.g2014 Feb. 15, v. 314 p.1-8dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl9013x0378-11277nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foreco.2013.11.0343Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03206naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245014300163300002000306520138300326592002801709650002001737650002601757650002001783650001601803650001501819650002201834650002001856650001501876650001901891650001701910650003001927650002101957650001001978650001001988650001601998650001702014650000902031650001302040650004402053650003402097650001702131650000902148650001102157650001402168650001302182650002902195650001002224650001602234700001602250700001702266700001302283700001402296700001902310700001202329773014902341856008102490852000902571655001202580IND60579091520221118043558.0170915e201708  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057909152DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-017-9534-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Ping12aA combined NMR- and HPLC-MS/MS-based metabolomics to evaluate the metabolic perturbations and subacute toxic effects of endosulfan on mice  ap. 18870-18880.  aEndosulfan is the newly persistent organic pollutants (POPs) added to the Stockholm Convention as its widespread use, persistence, bioaccumulation, long-range transport, endocrine disruption, and toxicity related to various adverse effects. In the present study, male mice were administrated endosulfan at 0, 0.5, and 3.5 mg/kg by gavage for 2 weeks. ¹H-NMR-based urinary metabolomics, HPLC-MS/MS-based targeted serum metabolomics, clinical analysis, and histopathology techniques were employed to evaluate the metabolic perturbations of subacute endosulfan exposure. Endosulfan exposures resulted in weight loss, liver inflammation and necrosis, and alterations in serum amino acids and urine metabolomics. Based on altered metabolites, several significantly perturbed pathways were identified including glycine, serine, and threonine metabolism; TCA cycle; pyruvate metabolism; glycolysis or gluconeogenesis; glycerophospholipid metabolism; and glyoxylate and dicarboxylate metabolism. Such pathways were highly related to amino acid metabolism, energy metabolism, and lipid metabolism. In addition, metabolomic results also demonstrated that gut microbiota was remarkably altered after endosulfan exposure. These observations may provide novel insight into revealing the potential toxic mechanism and evaluating the health risk of endosulfan exposure at metabolomic level.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadverse effects 3aamino acid metabolism 3abioaccumulation 3ablood serum 3aendosulfan 3aenergy metabolism 3agluconeogenesis 3aglycolysis 3ahistopathology 3ainflammation 3aintestinal microorganisms 3alipid metabolism 3aliver 3amales 3ametabolites 3ametabolomics 3amice 3anecrosis 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3apersistent organic pollutants 3apyruvic acid 3arisk 3aserine 3athreonine 3atoxicity 3atricarboxylic acid cycle 3aurine 3aweight loss1 aZhu, Wentao1 aWang, Dezhen1 aYan, Jin1 aWang, Yao1 aZhou, Zhiqiang1 aHe, Lin0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research international.g2017 Aug., v. 24, no. 23 p.18870-18880dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx0944-13447nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-017-9534-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01522naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002200150245010800172300001800280520030500298592002800603650002300631650002300654650000900677650002200686653002800708653002600736653002300762653002100785653001400806700002900820700002000849700002400869700003900893700002200932773008900954856008401043852000901127655001201136IND60529282420221119050643.0161019e20160330xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052928242DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tetlet.2016.02.0302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRamamohan, Mekala12aA concise approach to substituted Quinazolin-4(3H)-one natural products catalyzed by Iron(III) Chloride  ap. 1418-1420.  aA novel and efficient method for the synthesis of various Quinazolin-4(3H)-one natural products was developed utilizing Iron(III) Chloride catalyzed reaction as a key step.

It is recognized that such process is highly dependent on climate, soil properties, topography, and vegetation. However, few studies demonstrate how these mechanisms operate in highly weathered Oxisols. Therefore, this study evaluated the driving factors for C recovery and accumulation and its relations with fertility attributes in the soil profile (0 to 1m depth) in no-till (NT) croplands of south Brazil. The adoption of NT in the studied fields started between 1978 (pioneer areas) and 1990 and represent a range of textural and mineralogical characteristics South Brazil main croplands. Soil samples were collected in paired fields of native vegetation and NT (NV vs. long-term NT) to a depth of 1m. The studied NT areas of Rio Grande do Sul State were managed according to the principles of conservation agriculture (minimum soil disturbance, permanent soil cover and diverse crop rotation). The processes that drove SOC recovery in the studied sites were soil fertility management allied with high C input through intense crop rotation. The C recovery was were for areas with the predominance of soybean in the cropping system, higher levels of Al³⁺ and lower levels of Mg²⁺ and P. Sites with medium/high cropping intensity, lower levels of Al³⁺ and higher levels of P, Ca²⁺, Mg²⁺, and K⁺ resulted in higher C recovery.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOxisols 3aagricultural conservation practice 3aaluminum 3acalcium 3acarbon 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3acrop rotation 3acropland 3adisturbed soils 3aindigenous species 3amagnesium 3ano-tillage 3apotassium 3asoil fertility 3asoil profiles 3asoil properties 3asoil sampling 3asoybeans 3atopography 3avegetation 3aBrazil 0aC 0aNT 0aSOC 0aCA 0aTOC 0aV% 0aAl 0aNV 0aPCA 0aCECeffective 0aMg2+ 0aK+ 0aP 0aCa2+ 0aConservation agriculture 0aCrop rotation 0aDeep carbon 0aSoil fertility1 aAmado, Telmo Jorge Carneiro1 aRice, Charles W.1 aRuiz Diaz, Dorivar A.1 aBriedis, Clever1 aInagaki, Thiago Massao1 aGonçalves, Daniel Ruiz Potma0 tScience of the total environment.g2018 May 01, v. 622-623 p.735-742dElsevier B.V.aElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2017.12.0193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02802naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002100151245010900172300001600281520186700297592002802164650000902192650001702201650001502218650001202233700002002245700002102265700002202286773009802308856008502406852000902491655001202500IND60086059320221122070136.0141101e20111024xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008605932DNAL7 a10.1016/j.physbeh.2011.07.0322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTorterolo, Pablo10aHypocretinergic neurons are activated in conjunction with goal-oriented survival-related motor behaviors  ap. 823-830.  aHypocretinergic neurons are located in the area of the lateral hypothalamus which is responsible for mediating goal-directed, survival-related behaviors. Consequently, we hypothesize that the hypocretinergic system functions to promote these behaviors including those patterns of somatomotor activation upon which they are based. Further, we hypothesize that the hypocretinergic system is not involved with repetitive motor activities unless they occur in conjunction with the goal-oriented behaviors that are governed by the lateral hypothalamus. In order to determine the veracity of these hypotheses, we examined Fos immunoreactivity (as a marker of neuronal activity) in hypocretinergic neurons in the cat during: a) Exploratory Motor Activity; b) Locomotion without Reward; c) Locomotion with Reward; and d) Wakefulness without Motor Activity. Significantly greater numbers of hypocretinergic neurons expressed c-fos when the animals were exploring an unknown environment during Exploratory Motor Activity compared with all other paradigms. In addition, a larger number of Hcrt+Fos+neurons were activated during Locomotion with Reward than during Wakefulness without Motor Activity. Finally, very few hypocretinergic neurons were activated during Locomotion without Reward and Wakefulness without Motor Activity, wherein there was an absence of goal-directed activities. We conclude that the hypocretinergic system does not promote wakefulness per se or motor activity per se but is responsible for mediating specific goal-oriented behaviors that take place during wakefulness. Accordingly, we suggest that the hypocretinergic system is responsible for controlling the somatomotor system and coordinating its activity with other systems in order to produce successful goal-oriented survival-related behaviors that are controlled by the lateral hypothalamus.  aPublisher supplied data 3acats 3ahypothalamus 3alocomotion 3aneurons1 aRamos, Oscar V.1 aSampogna, Sharon1 aChase, Michael H.0 tPhysiology & behavior.g2011 Oct. 24, v. 104, no. 5 p.823-830dElsevier Inc.x0031-93847nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.physbeh.2011.07.0323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03278naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245008000159300001800239520178800257592002802045650001102073650001202084650001902096650002702115650001302142650002102155650002102176650001102197650002002208650001202228650001402240650001302254650001002267650001802277650001202295700002302307700002102330700002202351700002202373700002202395700001702417700001902434700001202453700002402465700002202489700002802511773012502539856007502664852000902739655001202748IND60778297920221119023027.0220524e20220523xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077829792DNAL7 a10.1039/d1gc04772h2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSalimi, Pejman10aSustainable lithium-ion batteries based on metal-free tannery waste biochar  ap. 4119-4129.  aIn the present study, we tackle the sustainable batteries topic by addressing its most defining aspects, namely what kind of waste material should be employed and its treatment for realizing performant battery anodes. In this regard, we focus on leather shaving waste (LSW), as it is an important waste element in many economies, resulting in an advantageous choice both from an environmental point of view and in terms of the circular economy. Herein, especially metal-free LSW is used to introduce an innovative kind of eco-friendly anode for lithium-ion batteries (LIBs). A pyrolysis process of the waste material is adopted to form biochar, followed by its texture engineering through either steam or CO₂, both of them recognized as safe and environmentally friendly procedures. Indeed, these procedures develop hierarchical micro/mesopores in the biochar and modify the amount of oxygen-containing functional groups on its surface, which can lead to high-performance anodes. In this respect, when a water-based solvent and carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) binder are employed, the fabricated electrode discloses high initial capacities and remarkable electrochemical stability in lithium-metal half-cells. In particular, the steam-activated electrode demonstrates a specific discharge capacity of 735 mA h g⁻¹ after 1000 charge and discharge cycles at 0.5 A g⁻¹. This anode electrode also secures an excellent initial capacity and acceptable cycling stability in full-cell LIBs where a high mass LiFePO₄ loading cathode is employed. The results reported here represent a noticeable improvement with respect to the state of the art, hence demonstrating the enormous potential associated with the green re-use of waste materials in important sectors such as energy storage.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanodes 3abiochar 3acarbon dioxide 3acarboxymethylcellulose 3acathodes 3acircular economy 3aelectrochemistry 3aenergy 3agreen chemistry 3aleather 3apyrolysis 3asolvents 3asteam 3atannery waste 3atexture1 aTieuli, Sebastiano1 aTaghavi, Somayeh1 aVenezia, Eleonora1 aFugattini, Silvio1 aLauciello, Simone1 aPrato, Mirko1 aMarras, Sergio1 aLi, Tao1 aSignoretto, Michela1 aCostamagna, Paola1 aProietti Zaccaria, Remo0 tGreen chemistry.g2022 May 23, v. 24, no. 10 p.4119-4129dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26906x1463-92707nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d1gc04772h3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02834naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002500149245011200174300001300286500001500299520159800314592002801912650001401940650001501954650002501969650001901994650001402013650002202027650001102049650000902060650001402069650002402083650001202107650001002119650003202129651001102161653001002172700002102182773011702203856008302320852000902403655001202412IND60088148220221119132558.0141102e20121230xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008814822DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jembe.2012.09.0152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMoreira, Thaise S.G.10aInvasive, non-indigenous corals in a tropical rocky shore environment: No evidence for generalist predation  ap. 7-13.  a2019-12-06  aThe biological invasion of rocky shore communities modifies species composition and the interaction between community elements. Two species, Tubastraea coccinea Lesson, 1829 and Tubastraea tagusensis Wells, 1982 have been identified as non-indigenous and invasive to the tropical rocky shores of southeast Brazil. The aim of the current study was to investigate predator–prey interactions between a guild of native potential generalist predators and the non-indigenous corals using total exclusion and partial cages versus controls on a tropical rocky shore in the southwest Atlantic. Despite generalist predators being present in natural densities on the experimental system and substantial settlement occurring during the 2year study (average density of Tubastraea spp. was 11.29 ind. 240cm⁻²) no significant differences were found in density or size of corals between treatments. Dominant groups in the accompanying biological community (ABC) were encrusting calcareous and turf algae, the sponge Iotrochota sp. and barnacles but ABC height and biomass and sediment mass did not differ between treatments. Due to transport and invasion of new communities these corals are thought to have escaped from predation despite a diverse suite of native potential generalist predators. Both corals have been shown to possess bioactive chemicals which predatory fish avoid and this would seem to be the mechanism of predator avoidance. The successful invasion by Tubastraea spp. in the southwest Atlantic is at least in part due to highly reduced (or nil) predation compared to the native range.  aPublisher supplied data 3asediments 3aCirripedia 3abioactive properties 3alawns and turf 3apredators 3aspecies diversity 3acorals 3afish 3apredation 3aecological invasion 3abiomass 3acages 3apredator-prey relationships 3aBrazil 0aAlgae1 aCreed, Joel.

Metal treatment induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. H ₂O ₂ accumulated 12 h after the Cd exposure in Vicia roots proportionally to intracellular Cd content of treated plants and O ₂⁻ by 24 h. The time course of oxidative stress evidenced by malondialdehyde (MDA) content indicated that lipoperoxidation occurred 24 h after Cd treatment. Prior to oxidative burst, the metal induced a similar dose-dependent kinetic of transcript accumulation for Hsp70.1 , MT2 , GR1 and Cu-ZnSOD genes with a rapid increase or response at 12 h of Cd treatment, whereas the prolonged exposure to Cd resulted in reduction in the mRNA levels for all four genes. The pattern of Cat transcript accumulation was different from the other four genes and correlated with the intracellular oxidative burst. Cat transcripts were accumulated at 24 h in the Vicia roots, and this antioxidative enzyme gene was at high level of expression till the end of treatment concomitantly to ROS overproduction and MDA accumulation. The results indicate two different gene expression pathways activated by Cd-induced abiotic stress conditions and might be related to the cell oxidative status.  aPublisher supplied data 3aVicia faba 3aabiotic stress 3acadmium 3adose response 3agene expression 3agenes 3amalondialdehyde 3amessenger RNA 3aoxidative stress 3areactive oxygen species 3aroots 0aCadmium 0acatalase 0aHsp70 0aroot 0aROS 0aVicia faba1 aEl Ferjani, E.1 aLedoigt, G.1 aGoupil, P.0 tPlant biosystems.g2015 Mar. 4, v. 149, no. 2 p.280-288dTaylor & Francisx1724-55757nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/11263504.2013.8224323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03330naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003800113040001800151100001900169245012700188300001800315500001500333520151300348592002801861650001801889650001101907650000901918650002701927650000701954650001201961650001701973650001401990650001802004650001602022650003102038650001202069650003002081650003202111650003902143650001102182650004502193650001302238650000902251650002802260650001602288650003702304650002102341650002302362651001802385651002502403651001202428653002302440700002502463700002602488700002102514773008802535856008402623852000902707655001202716IND60088194820221117041832.0141102e201102  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008819482DNAL7 a211455732pmid7 a10.1016/j.watres.2010.11.0262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKahler, Amy M.10aSource water quality effects on monochloramine inactivation of adenovirus, coxsackievirus, echovirus, and murine norovirus  ap. 1745-1751.  a2019-12-06  aThere is a need for more information regarding monochloramine disinfection efficacy for viruses in water. In this study, monochloramine disinfection efficacy was investigated for coxsackievirus B5 (CVB5), echovirus 11 (E11), murine norovirus (MNV), and human adenovirus 2 (HAdV2) in one untreated ground water and two partially treated surface waters. Duplicate disinfection experiments were completed at pH 7 and 8 in source water at concentrations of 1 and 3 mg/L monochloramine at 5 and 15 °C. The Efficiency Factor Hom (EFH) model was used to calculate CT values (mg-min/L) required to achieve 2-, 3-, and 4-log₁₀ reductions in viral titers. In all water types, monochloramine disinfection was most effective for MNV, with 3-log₁₀ CT values at 5 °C ranging from 27 to 110. Monochloramine disinfection was least effective for HAdV2 and E11, depending on water type, with 3-log₁₀ CT values at 5 °C ranging from 1200 to 3300 and 810 to 2300, respectively. Overall, disinfection proceeded faster at 15 °C and pH 7 for all water types. Inactivation of the study viruses was significantly different between water types, but there was no indication that overall disinfection efficacy was enhanced or inhibited in any one water type. CT values for HAdV2 in two types of source water exceeded federal CT value recommendations in the US. The results of this study demonstrate that water quality impacts the inactivation of viruses and should be considered when developing chloramination plans.  aPublisher supplied data 3awater quality 3amodels 3amice 3aHuman mastadenovirus C 3apH 3aviruses 3adisinfection 3aNorovirus 3asurface water 3agroundwater 2aAdenoviridaexdrug effects 2aAnimals 2aChloraminesxpharmacology 2aDisinfectantsxpharmacology 2aEnterovirus B, Humanxdrug effects 2aHumans 2aHydrogen-Ion Concentrationxdrug effects 2aKinetics 2aMice 2aNorovirusxdrug effects 2aTemperature 2aVirus Inactivationxdrug effects 2aWaterxstandards 2aWater Microbiology 3aUnited States 0aDistrict of Columbia 0aGeorgia 0aHuman adenovirus C1 aCromeans, Theresa L.1 aRoberts, Jacquelin M.1 aHill, Vincent R.0 tWater research.g2011 Feb., v. 45, no. 4 p.1745-1751dElsevier Ltdx0043-13547nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.watres.2010.11.0263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02448naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002300151245012700174300001600301520108400317592002801401650001101429650001201440650001501452650001001467650001901477650001701496650001501513650001801528650002401546650001401570650001501584650000901599651001201608653001901620653001801639653001801657653002201675700001801697700002301715700002101738700002401759773010001783856008601883852000901969655001201978IND60527100520221122033426.0190412e201601  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052710052DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecolind.2015.08.0462doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKenney, William F.10aSediment cores from shallow lakes preserve reliable, informative paleoenvironmental archives despite hurricane-force winds  ap. 963-969.  aComparison of sediment cores collected in 1999 and 2013 from shallow Lake Harris, Florida, USA showed that the sediment maintained stratigraphic integrity despite multiple hurricanes passing through the area in 2004. Sediments less than 50 years old displayed small losses of organic matter (OM), total phosphorus (TP) and heat-extractable (HE-P) through time that are unrelated to hurricane impacts. Nevertheless, sediment that accumulated between the two core collection dates contained 4-fold more TP than was lost from the sediment over the 14-year period, indicating that sediments in Lake Harris are a net sink for water-column TP. Persistent, elevated 137Cs activity in sediments deposited since the mid-1960s indicates protracted cesium input to the lake from this subtropical watershed. There is also evidence for downward transport of 137Cs in the sediment profile between core collection dates. Prolonged export of 137Cs from the watershed and downward mobility of the radionuclide in the sediment profile diminish the utility of 137Cs as a dating tool in Lake Harris.  aPublisher supplied data 3acesium 3aexports 3ahurricanes 3alakes 3aorganic matter 3apaleoecology 3aphosphorus 3aradionuclides 3asediment deposition 3asediments 3awatersheds 3awind 3aFlorida 0aPaleolimnology 0aShallow lakes 0aPb-210 dating 0aHurricane impacts1 aBrenner, Mark1 aArnold, T.

Understanding the complex interactions between foulant-membrane which drive the attachment and growth of foulants on membrane surface is of both fundamental and practical importance. This work aims to understand the molecular interaction mechanisms of organic fouling on RO-TFC membranes. A surface forces apparatus (SFA) was employed to directly measure the interaction forces and time-dependent adsorption behaviors between model organic foulants: humic acid (HA), bovine serum albumin (BSA), and lipopolysaccharides (LPS) and a polyamide (PA) thin film. PA thin film was prepared by interfacial condensation polymerization on mica substrates using m-phenylenediamine and 1,3,5-benzenetricarbonyltrichloride. The interaction forces between PA films and different foulant (HA, BSA, LPS) were directly measured under controlled solution chemistries in an asymmetric configuration (foulant-deposited PA films vs. PA films). The adsorption behaviors of these foulants on PA films were directly monitored in a symmetric configuration (PA films vs. PA films). These interactions were examined as a function of both contact time and solution chemistry (ionic strength). In asymmetrical configuration, both HA and BSA show repulsion with PA surface during approach and adhesion during separation, but LPS demonstrates repulsion only. In symmetrical configuration, all the foulants show adsorption on PA surface and the initial adsorption rate of foulant to PA surface follows the order of BSA>LPS>HA.

A pinewood ground flora with more than 20% bilberry cover is considered good habitat for capercaillie (Tetrao urogallus), a large forest grouse of considerable conservation interest throughout Europe. Old, semi-natural Scots pine woodland is considered its prime habitat in Scotland, although this is limited in area compared to twentieth century planted forests. Action to manipulate environmental conditions within Scots pine plantations by altering light levels to favour bilberry through thinning and felling could potentially increase greatly the area of available capercaillie habitat in Scotland. We implemented a five year study to look at bilberry response to variable intensity thinning in two Scots pine plantations, where thinning followed management guidance for capercaillie available at the time. Bilberry was present in both forests but a positive response to thinning was not universal; although at both sites bilberry cover increased significantly over five years with levels >20% cover reached, this could only be attributed to the thinning treatment at one of the sites. A treatment of small patch clearfelling did not lead to losses in bilberry. Management guidance published after the trial had begun, identified the appropriate intensity of thinning for enhancing bilberry cover at our study sites, indicated by the relative increase of bilberry in the plots where the prescription had been followed. Although there was no significant treatment effect by year five, 42% average bilberry cover was reached at one site tested. However the format of this guidance, a range of stem density-tree height combinations, was difficult to apply using typical forest management data and we explore redefining the guidance as a post thinning stand basal area range. We suggest >22 to <31m2ha−1 basal area would be appropriate in Scots pine plantations established at normal spacing and subject to the commonest form of selective thinning regime. This range in basal area can be achieved without conflicting with management for timber production. Our results also support small patch clearfelling as a method of diversifying plantation age structure which is compatible with maintaining capercaillie brood habitat.  aPublisher supplied data 3aplantations 3aforests 3afelling 3aTetrao urogallus 3aflora 3ainformation management 3aVaccinium myrtillus 3aplanting 3awoodlands 3aVaccinium vitis-idaea 3agrouse 3aPinus sylvestris 3ashrubs 3aage structure 3aforest litter 3aenvironmental factors 3atimber production 3aCalluna vulgaris 3astand basal area 3ahabitats 3aScotland 0aStand treatments 0aConservation management 0aTimber production 0aGrouse tetradonidae 0abasal area1 aConnolly, Thomas1 aQuine, Christopher P.0 tForest ecology and management.g2014 Feb. 15, v. 314 p.94-103dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl9013x0378-11277nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foreco.2013.11.0383Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02769naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100006500139245011700204300001600321500002000337520130600357592002801663650002001691650001901711650002301730650001001753650001901763650001401782650001801796650000901814650001801823650001401841650002301855650001801878651001101896700002901907700002501936700002601961700002901987700001502016700006702031773013102098856007302229852000902302655001202311IND60602916520221120150621.0180711e201808  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060291652DNAL7 a10.1111/lam.130092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGuardiola‐Avila, I.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4996-047810aIsolation and identification of Vibrio species in the Rio Bravo/Grande and water bodies from Reynosa, Tamaulipas  ap. 190-196.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe Rio Bravo (Rio Grande) adjoins various states in the Mexican region and has a great importance in water distribution in the northeast Tamaulipas (Mexico). In this work 161 strains were isolated, identified and characterized from the water samples taken from the flow of the Rio Bravo and the two inner canals that cover Reynosa city. The strains were identified as Vibrio cholerae (74·5%), Vibrio spp. (1·2%) and Vibrio mimicus (0·6%). Furthermore, the detected virulence genes in the V. cholerae strains, were the hlyA, ompU, tcpA, toxR genes in 78·3, 62·5, 15·8 and 90·8% respectively. Only the ompU and vmh genes were detected in the V. mimicus strain. These results indicate the presence of multi‐toxigenic V. cholerae strains in the Rio Bravo/Grande and in the water bodies from Reynosa city, which could represent a risk for the exposed population. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Water quality is associated with public health, as it plays an important role in the transmission and epidemiology of pathogens such as Vibrio, since this species have been responsible for human diseases around the world. This study demonstrated the presence of toxigenic Vibrio species in water bodies in Reynosa surroundings, indicating that water bodies may be a source of public health risk.  aPublisher supplied data 3aVibrio cholerae 3aVibrio mimicus 3aat-risk population 3agenes 3ahuman diseases 3apathogens 3apublic health 3arisk 3asurface water 3avirulence 3awater distribution 3awater quality 3aMexico1 aMartínez‐Vázquez, V.1 aRequena‐Castro, R.1 aJuárez‐Rendón, K.1 aAguilera‐Arreola, M.G.1 aRivera, G.1 aBocanegra‐García, V.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0728-20180 tLetters in applied microbiology.g2018 Aug., v. 67, no. 2 p.190-196dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl37648x0266-82547nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/lam.130093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03255naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245015600167300001800323520167100341592002802012650002302040650001302063650001302076650001202089650001602101650002302117650001902140650001202159650001102171650001402182650001402196650001402210650002102224650001302245650001402258650001402272650002702286650002102313650002102334650002002355700002002375700001602395700001502411700001802426700002002444700001902464700001502483700002202498773008802520856008402608852000902692655001202701IND60088195020221117042000.0141102e201102  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008819502DNAL7 a10.1016/j.watres.2010.11.0312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aForrez, Ilse10aBiogenic metals for the oxidative and reductive removal of pharmaceuticals, biocides and iodinated contrast media in a polishing membrane bioreactor  ap. 1763-1773.  aPharmaceutical and personal care products, biocides and iodinated contrast media (ICM) are persistent compounds, which appear in ng to μg L⁻¹ in secondary effluents of sewage treatment plants (STPs). In this work, biogenic metals manganese oxides (BioMnOx) and bio-palladium (Bio-Pd) were applied in lab-scale membrane bioreactors (MBR) as oxidative and reductive technologies, respectively, to remove micropollutants from STP-effluent. From the 29 substances detected in the STP-effluent, 14 were eliminated in the BioMnOx-MBR: ibuprofen (>95%), naproxen (>95%), diuron (>94%), codeine (>93%), N-acetyl-sulfamethoxazole (92%), chlorophene (>89%), diclofenac (86%), mecoprop (81%), triclosan (>78%), clarithromycin, (75%), iohexol (72%), iopromide (68%), iomeprol (63%) and sulfamethoxazole (52%). The putative removal mechanisms were the chemical oxidation by BioMnOx and/or the biological removal by Pseudomonas putida and associated bacteria in the enriched biofilm. Yet, the removal rates (highest value: 2.6 μg diclofenac L⁻¹ d⁻¹) need to improve by a factor 10 in order to be competitive with ozonation. ICM, persistent towards oxidative techniques, were successfully dehalogenated with a novel reductive technique using Bio-Pd as a nanosized catalyst in an MBR. Iomeprol, iopromide and iohexol were removed for >97% and the more recalcitrant diatrizoate for 90%. The conditions favorable for microbial H₂-production enabling the charging of the Pd catalyst, were shown to be important for the removal of ICM. Overall, the results indicate that Mn oxide and Pd coupled to microbial catalysis offer novel potential for advanced water treatment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPseudomonas putida 3abacteria 3abiocides 3abiofilm 3abioreactors 3acatalytic activity 3aclarithromycin 3acodeine 3adiuron 3aeffluents 3aibuprofen 3amanganese 3amanganese oxides 3amecoprop 3aoxidation 3aozonation 3apersonal care products 3asewage treatment 3asulfamethoxazole 3awater treatment1 aCarballa, Marta1 aFink, Guido1 aWick, Arne1 aHennebel, Tom1 aVanhaecke, Lynn1 aTernes, Thomas1 aBoon, Nico1 aVerstraete, Willy0 tWater research.g2011 Feb., v. 45, no. 4 p.1763-1773dElsevier Ltdx0043-13547nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.watres.2010.11.0313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03347naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245013400169300001400303520177300317592002802090650002702118650002402145650001402169650002102183650001702204650001902221650001602240650002102256650001202277650001502289650002702304650002802331650001502359650001002374650001302384651001002397653002402407653001702431653002602448653002502474653002402499700001902523700001402542700001602556700001402572700001702586773012002603856008502723852000902808655001202817IND60525180420221117063616.0190318e201609  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052518042DNAL7 a10.1016/j.pestbp.2016.01.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Shuzhen10aSusceptibility of field populations of the diamondback moth, Plutella xylostella, to a selection of insecticides in Central China  ap. 38-46.  aThe diamondback moth (DBM), Plutella xylostella (L.) (Lepidoptera: Plutellidae), is a globally distributed and important economic pest. Chemical control is the primary approach to regulate populations of this pest. However, resistance to insecticides evolves following heavy and frequent use. Therefore, the insecticide resistance in field populations of P. xylostella collected from Central China from 2013 to 2014 was determined with a leaf-dipping method. Based on the results of the monitoring, P. xylostella has developed high levels of resistance to beta-cypermethrin (resistance ratio=69.76–335.76-fold), Bt (WG-001) (RR=35.43–167.36), and chlorfluazuron (RR=13.60–104.95) and medium levels of resistance to chlorantraniliprole (RR=1.19–14.26), chlorfenapyr (RR=4.22–13.44), spinosad (RR=5.89–21.45), indoxacarb (RR=4.01–34.45), and abamectin (RR=23.88–95.15). By contrast, the field populations of P. xylostella remained susceptible to or developed low levels of resistance to diafenthiuron (RR=1.61–8.05), spinetoram (RR=0.88–2.35), and cyantraniliprole (RR=0.4–2.15). Moreover, the LC50 values of field populations of P. xylostella were highly positively correlated between chlorantraniliprole and cyantraniliprole (r=0.88, P=0.045), chlorantraniliprole and spinosad (r=0.66, P=0.039), spinosad and diafenthiuron (r=0.57, P=0.0060), and chlorfenapyr and diafenthiuron (r=0.51, P=0.016). Additionally, the activities of detoxification enzymes in field populations of P. xylostella were significantly positively correlated with the log LC50 values of chlorantraniliprole and spinosad. The results of this study provide an important base for developing effective and successful strategies to manage insecticide resistance in P. xylostella.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacillus thuringiensis 3aPlutella xylostella 3aabamectin 3achemical control 3achlorfenapyr 3achlorfluazuron 3acorrelation 3acyantraniliprole 3aenzymes 3aindoxacarb 3ainsecticide resistance 3alethal concentration 50 3amonitoring 3apests 3aspinosad 3aChina 0aPlutella xylostella 0aInsecticides 0aResistance monitoring 0aCorrelation analysis 0aDetoxifying enzymes1 aZhang, Xiaolei1 aShen, Jun1 aMao, Kaikai1 aYou, Hong1 aLi, Jianhong0 tPesticide biochemistry and physiology.g2016 Sept., v. 132 p.38-46dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl1414x0048-35757nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.pestbp.2016.01.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03102naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002000153245009400173300001600267520170700283592002801990650001602018650001302034650001402047650001502061650001802076650001902094650001102113650001202124650001202136650001802148650001502166651001402181653001502195653001202210653001402222653001602236653002002252653002602272700002502298700002602323700002402349700002802373773012202401856008802523852000902611655001202620IND60615422020221118162557.0201125e20180501xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061542202DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2017.12.0242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMaavara, Taylor14aThe role of groundwater discharge fluxes on Si:P ratios in a major tributary to Lake Erie  ap. 814-824.  aGroundwater discharge can be a major source of nutrients to river systems. Although quantification of groundwater nitrate loading to streams is common, the dependence of surface water silicon (Si) and phosphorus (P) concentrations on groundwater sources has rarely been determined. Additionally, the ability of groundwater discharge to drive surface water Si:P ratios has not been contextualized relative to riverine inputs or in-stream transformations. In this study, we quantify the seasonal dynamics of Si and P cycles in the Grand River (GR) watershed, the largest Canadian watershed draining into Lake Erie, to test our hypothesis that regions of Si-rich groundwater discharge increase surface water Si:P ratios. Historically, both the GR and Lake Erie have been considered stoichiometrically P-limited, where the molar Si:P ratio is greater than the ~16:1 phytoplankton uptake ratio. However, recent trends suggest that eastern Lake Erie may be approaching Si-limitation. We sampled groundwater and surface water for dissolved and reactive particulate Si as well as total dissolved P for 12months within and downstream of a 50-km reach of high groundwater discharge. Our results indicate that groundwater Si:P ratios are lower than the corresponding surface water and that groundwater is a significant source of bioavailable P to surface water. Despite these observations, the watershed remains P-limited for the majority of the year, with localized periods of Si-limitation. We further find that groundwater Si:P ratios are a relatively minor driver of surface water Si:P, but that the magnitude of Si and P loads from groundwater represent a large proportion of the overall fluxes to Lake Erie.  aPublisher supplied data 3agroundwater 3anitrates 3anutrients 3aphosphorus 3aphytoplankton 3apollution load 3arivers 3asilicon 3astreams 3asurface water 3awatersheds 3aLake Erie 0aPhosphorus 0aSilicon 0aLake Erie 0aGrand River 0aNutrient ratios 0aGroundwater discharge1 aSlowinski, Stephanie1 aRezanezhad, Fereidoun1 aVan Meter, Kimberly1 aVan Cappellen, Philippe0 tScience of the total environment.g2018 May 01, v. 622-623 p.814-824dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2017.12.0243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01967naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002100140245009700161300001800258520106200276592002801338650002401366650001201390650001401402650002601416700002901442773013401471856007501605852000901680655001201689IND60778298420221119023401.0220524e20220523xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077829842DNAL7 a10.1039/d2cs00101b2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFoley, Daniel J.10aKetones as strategic building blocks for the synthesis of natural product-inspired compounds  ap. 4094-4120.  aNatural product-inspired compound collections serve as excellent sources for the identification of new bioactive compounds to treat disease. However, such compounds must necessarily be more structurally-enriched than traditional screening compounds, therefore inventive synthetic strategies and reliable methods are needed to prepare them. Amongst the various possible starting materials that could be considered for the synthesis of natural product-inspired compounds, ketones can be especially valuable due to the vast variety of complexity-building synthetic transformations that they can take part in, their high prevalence as commercial building blocks, and relative ease of synthesis. With a view towards developing a unified synthetic strategy for the preparation of next generation bioactive compound collections, this review considers whether ketones could serve as general precursors in this regard, and summarises the opulence of synthetic transformations available for the annulation of natural product ring-systems to ketone starting materials.  aPublisher supplied data 3abioactive compounds 3aketones 3ascreening 3asynthetic populations1 aWaldmann, H.q(Herbert),0 tChemical Society reviews.g2022 May 23, v. 51, no. 10 p.4094-4120dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:20471x1460-47447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d2cs00101b3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle05092naa a2200721 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002400150245008900174300001600263520304000279592002803319650003103347650001603378650002003394650001703414650002503431650001203456650001903468650001903487650001203506650001503518650001603533650001703549650001203566650001003578650001503588650001103603650001503614650002403629650001503653650001503668650001303683650002303696650000903719650002203728650001603750650001803766650001903784650001503803651002303818651003103841653001703872653002503889653001903914653002403933653002003957653001803977700001903995700002504014700002604039700001904065700002404084700002004108773011704128856008504245961001904330852000904349655001204358IND60542521820221120104033.0190403e20140901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054252182DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foreco.2013.12.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMitchell, Robert J.10aFuture climate and fire interactions in the southeastern region of the United States  ap. 316-326.  aFire has a profound, though paradoxical influence on landscapes of the southeastern U.S.; it simultaneously maintains native biodiversity and ecosystem processes but also threatens silvicultural resources and human landscapes. Furthermore, since the majority of the southern landscape is heavily influenced by human activities, contemporary fire regimes are human managed disturbances within extant fire-dependent ecosystems. Though there is considerable uncertainty in climate projections for the southeastern U.S., climate change will likely impact both prescribed fire and wildfire. In this review, we synthesize climate change-fire interactions, discuss the impacts of uncertainty in a human-dominated landscape, and illuminate how both climate change projections and their uncertainties might impact our ability to manage forests in the Southeast. We define the Southeast region as consisting of the Gulf Coastal Plain, Lower Atlantic Coastal Plain, Piedmont and southern Appalachians and associated subregions. This region has the greatest area burned by prescribed fire, the highest number of wildfires in the continental U.S. and contains globally significant hotspots of biodiversity, much of which is dependent on frequent fire. The use of prescribed fire as a management tool depends on a suite of weather and fuel conditions which are affected by climate. Over the next five decades, general circulation models (GCMs) consistently predict air temperature to increase by 1.5–3°C in the Southeast. Precipitation forecasts are more uncertain with respect to the mean; but, most models predict an increase in precipitation variability. Increases in the likelihood of severe droughts may increase wildfire occurrence while simultaneously limiting the implementation of prescribed burning by restricting the number of days within current prescription guidelines. While the Southeast has among the highest potential for C storage and sequestration, a reduction in C sequestration capacity due to increasing disturbances such as drought, insect infestations, hurricanes and fire, is possible. The potential for long-term shifts in forest composition from climate-altered fire regimes if coupled with an increased potential for wildfire occurrence could reduce quality and quantity of water released from forests at times when demand for high quality water will intensify for human use. Furthermore, any reduction in prescribed burning is likely to result in decreased biological diversity, particularly in the Coastal Plain, a global hotspot of biodiversity. Lastly, more future area burned by wildfire rather than prescribed fire has the potential to negatively influence regional air quality. Mitigating the negative effects of climate change-fire interactions would require actively exploiting favorable seasonal and inter-annual climate windows. Monitoring the type conversions of agricultural and fiber production forest will be critical for long-term projections of fire risk and watershed impacts of altered fire regimes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGeneral Circulation Models 3aair quality 3aair temperature 3abiodiversity 3acarbon sequestration 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3acoastal plains 3adrought 3aecosystems 3afire regime 3aforest fires 3aforests 3afuels 3aguidelines 3ahumans 3ahurricanes 3ainsect infestations 3alandscapes 3amonitoring 3apiedmont 3aprescribed burning 3arisk 3atimber production 3auncertainty 3awater quality 3awater quantity 3awatersheds 3aAppalachian region 3aSoutheastern United States 0aBiodiversity 0aCarbon sequestration 0aClimate change 0aEcological services 0aPrescribed fire 0aWildland fire1 aLiu, Yongqiang1 aO’Brien, Joseph J.1 aElliott, Katherine J.1 aStarr, Gregory1 aMiniat, Chelcy Ford1 aHiers, J.

The aim of this work was to make the genetic improvement of Gypsophila more rational and focused. The study of basic chromosome number and the reproductive system (potential barriers to intraspecific and interspecific incompatibilities) of the wild species as well as the commercial hybrids forms the basis of crossbreeding and selection of variety. A significant difference in ploidy was found between the species paniculata , its cultivar Flocon de Neige doubles, the species libanotica Boiss. (n = 34) and Pacifica Kom. (n = 68). A significant difference in the chromosome number was found among the commercial hybrids of Gypsophila under investigation, and this difference was observed among them as well as when compared with the wild type species. The flower structure of commercial hybrids can be remarkably complex. Some hybrids such as Biancanieves® and MeryG® showed empty pollen sacs, whereas others such as “Mirabella” and New Love® showed pollen grains trapped into anthers. However, the pollen, when present, exhibits immature or degenerated appearance. The examined commercial hybrids showed a gynoecium morphologically and anatomically conforming to that of wild species and it was potentially fertile. Therefore, the fertile pollen collected from the wild species could be used to fertilize the compatible eggs of commercial hybrids, thereby speeding the process of breeding varieties.  aPublisher supplied data 3acultivars 3aplant breeding 3ahybrids 3agynoecium 3achromosome number 3agenetic improvement 3aploidy 3acut flowers 3acrossing 3aflowers 3apollen 3aGypsophila paniculata 3aeggs 0afloral structure 0aGypsophila 0amale sterility 0aChromosome number 0aanthers1 aSchiff, S.1 aTani, C.1 aPasqualetto, P.1 aBennici, A.0 tPlant biosystems.g2015 Mar. 4, v. 149, no. 2 p.322-328dTaylor & Francisx1724-55757nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/11263504.2013.8240413Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02829naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002800140245014300168500002000311520128700331592002801618650002401646650001301670650002501683650001701708650001301725650001801738650002001756650002801776650001401804650001201818650001101830650002301841650001701864650002901881650001001910650002501920650001101945700002701956700002201983700002802005700002302033700006202056773014602118856007402264852000902338655001202347IND60602916820221120140013.0180711e201808  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060291682DNAL7 a10.1002/arch.214602doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGrizanova, Ekaterina V.10aMaintenance of redox balance by antioxidants in hemolymph of the greater wax moth Galleria mellonella larvae during encapsulation response  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe lipid peroxidation process in hemocytes, activities of phenoloxidase and key enzymatic antioxidants (superoxide dismutase, glutathione‐S‐transferase, catalase) and nonenzymatic antioxidants (thiols, ascorbate) in hemolymph of the greater wax moth Galleria mellonella L. (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae) were studied during the encapsulation process of nylon implants. It has been established that as soon as 15 min after piercing a cuticle with the implant, a capsule is formed on its surface. Active melanization of the capsule has been shown to last for 4 h. During the first hours after incorporating the implant, an increase in phenoloxidase activity and lipid peroxidation in the insect hemocytes has been revealed. Adhesion and degranulation on the surface of foreign object lead to the depletion of total hemocytes count (THC). Our results indicated that thiols and ascorbate molecules take part in the immediate antioxidant response, during later stages of encapsulation process hemolymph glutathione‐S‐transferase detoxifies and protects insect organism thereby restoring the internal redox balance. We suggest that nonenzymatic and enzymatic antioxidants of hemolymph plasma play a key role in the maintenance of redox balance during encapsulation of foreign targets.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGalleria mellonella 3aadhesion 3aantioxidant activity 3aantioxidants 3acatalase 3aencapsulation 3aenzyme activity 3aglutathione transferase 3ahemocytes 3ainsects 3alarvae 3alipid peroxidation 3amelanization 3amonophenol monooxygenase 3anylon 3asuperoxide dismutase 3athiols1 aSemenova, Alexandra D.1 aKomarov, Denis A.1 aChertkova, Ekaterina A.1 aSlepneva, Irina A.1 aDubovskiy, Ivan M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9691-39600 tArchives of insect biochemistry and physiology.g2018 Aug., v. 98, no. 4 p.e21460-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl34835x0739-44627nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/arch.214603Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03180naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002500164245012500189300001600314520160000330592002801930650001301958650001501971650001901986650002102005650004302026650001402069650002602083650002102109650001502130650002402145650002702169650002102196650001202217650005002229650002702279650002502306650002302331650002902354650002602383650002802409700002202437700001802459700002502477773011502502856004802617852000902665655001202674IND4465024620221123032057.0121003e201109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446502462DNAL7 a215233562pmid7 a10.1007/s12010-011-9241-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAryee, Alberta N.

The procedure simultaneously separated and detected the unreacted triacylglycerols (TAG), diacyl-, and monoacyl-glycerol (DAG and MAG) co-products, residual alcohol as well as free fatty acid (FFA) based on retention times. The chromatograms showed well separated and resolved peaks. The elution of the components from the transesterification reaction in increasing order was: TAG < DAG < FFA < MAG. Generally, higher alcohol ratios decreased the conversion of TAG in all the oils studied with between 14% and 94% of TAG remaining at all the treatment combinations. Higher amount of salmon skin oil (SSO) TAG was generally converted to DAG than Rothsay composite (RC) and olive oil (OO) TAG. Relatively higher amount of OO DAG was converted to MAG than SSO and RC with only 5–14% DAG remaining in OO. RC and OO generally accumulated less MAG, and this was reflected as lower MAG levels in RC (<6%) and OO (<14%) compared with SSO (<27%). For the various treatment combinations and the three oils used in this study, the least amount of FFA was recorded in transesterified OO with a maximum of approximately 4%. This HPLC method can be used as a simple and fast technique to analyze the reaction components and products of transesterification reactions without the need for additional derivatization steps.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalcohols 3acoproducts 3aderivatization 3afree fatty acids 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3aolive oil 3aquantitative analysis 3arefractive index 3asalmon oil 3atransesterification 3atriacylglycerol lipase 3atriacylglycerols 2aAnimals 2aChromatography, High Pressure Liquidxmethods 2aDiglyceridesxanalysis 2aFish Oilsxchemistry 2aLipasexmetabolism 2aMonoglyceridesxanalysis 2aPlant Oilsxchemistry 2aTriglyceridesxanalysis1 aPhillip, Leroy E.1 aCue, Roger I.1 aSimpson, Benjamin K.0 tApplied biochemistry and biotechnology.g2011 Sept., v. 165, no. 1 p.155-177dSpringer-Verlagx0273-22897nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12010-011-9241-z  aDNAL 7aarticle02622naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001700140245009600157300001800253520163900271592002801910650001501938650000901953650001301962650001101975650001901986650001802005650002402023650001002047700002102057773013402078856007502212852000902287655001202296IND60778298520221119023320.0220524e20220523xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077829852DNAL7 a10.1039/d2cs00112h2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFan, Xinlong10a1D Colloidal chains: recent progress from formation to emergent properties and applications  ap. 4023-4074.  aIntegrating nanoscale building blocks of low dimensionality (0D; i.e., spheres) into higher dimensional structures endows them and their corresponding materials with emergent properties non-existent or only weakly existent in the individual building blocks. Constructing 1D chains, 2D arrays and 3D superlattices using nanoparticles and colloids therefore continues to be one of the grand goals in colloid and nanomaterial science. Amongst these higher order structures, 1D colloidal chains are of particular interest, as they possess unique anisotropic properties. In recent years, the most relevant advances in 1D colloidal chain research have been made in novel synthetic methodologies and applications. In this review, we first address a comprehensive description of the research progress concerning various synthetic strategies developed to construct 1D colloidal chains. Following this, we highlight the amplified and emergent properties of the resulting materials, originating from the assembly of the individual building blocks and their collective behavior, and discuss relevant applications in advanced materials. In the discussion of synthetic strategies, properties, and applications, particular attention will be paid to overarching concepts, fresh trends, and potential areas of future research. We believe that this comprehensive review will be a driver to guide the interdisciplinary field of 1D colloidal chains, where nanomaterial synthesis, self-assembly, physical property studies, and material applications meet, to a higher level, and open up new research opportunities at the interface of classical disciplines.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanisotropy 3aarea 3acolloids 3afields 3agroup behavior 3ananoparticles 3aphysical properties 3awills1 aWalther, Andreas0 tChemical Society reviews.g2022 May 23, v. 51, no. 10 p.4023-4074dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:20471x1460-47447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d2cs00112h3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03236naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245008000168300001600248520196400264592002802228650002302256650001502279650001502294650001102309650002202320650001002342650001102352650001202363650001802375650002502393650001502418653001002433653001402443653002302457653002702480653003002507700001902537700002202556700001702578773010002595856008602695852000902781655001202790IND60527101020221122013206.0190412e201602  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052710102DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecolind.2015.08.0512doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNorton, Lisa14aThe importance of scale in the development of ecosystem service indicators?  ap. 130-140.  aUnderstanding the interactions between ecosystems and their underlying environmental constraints, the services which they provide, and the people benefiting from those services, are essential for the effective management and sustainability of socio-ecosystems (ecosystems which support and are impacted upon by humans). Ecosystem service (ES) indicators attempt to provide a means of measuring service provision, but the scale at which they are developed is likely to impact on how they can be used to influence the effective management of socio-ecosystems. This paper compares science and practice in the development of service measures at contrasting scales in: (a) an active research project, focused on local catchment management to improve water quality at Loweswater in the English Lake District, and (b) a science-based study developing national scale indicators of water quality using the Countryside Survey dataset.The paper explores different approaches taken towards the production of ecological measures, which inform on either single or multiple ES delivery across the land/water interface, dependent on scale. It considers how scale impacts on the process of gathering data and on the types of data which can contribute to ES indicators. It further reflects on how service indicators representing different scales of study may be used and by whom. Local scales, in this case the catchment scale, provide a valuable socio-ecological unit for exploring ES delivery, but the extent to which ecosystem service indicators may be used by local actors is uncertain. Larger scale studies may be confined to single services by virtue of data availability but can provide useful policy tools for targeting action. The paper concludes that ‘scale’ is an important consideration when developing ES indicators. It also concludes that questions around the utility of such indicators should consider the relevance of scale and how it relates to governance.  aPublisher supplied data 3aecosystem services 3aecosystems 3agovernance 3ahumans 3aissues and policy 3alakes 3apeople 3asurveys 3awater quality 3awatershed management 3awatersheds 0aScale 0aModelling 0aEcosystem services 0aStakeholder engagement 0aInterdisciplinary science1 aGreene, Sheila1 aScholefield, Paul1 aDunbar, Mike0 tEcological indicators.g2016 Feb., v. 61 p.130-140dElsevier LtdwJournal:6196x1470-160X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2015.08.0513Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03181naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002200152245017700174520162600351592002801977650002502005650001702030650001902047650001702066650001902083650001802102650001902120650001802139650001602157650000902173650002302182650001702205650001502222653001802237653001702255653002202272653002402294653001602318653002102334700002902355700002102384700002002405700002002425700002202445700002102467773009102488856008702579852000902666655001202675IND60783763120221120053326.0220809e202209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078376312DNAL7 a10.1016/j.peptides.2022.1708432doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSrivastava, Umang10aAntioxidant and immunomodulatory potency of Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus NCDC24 fermented milk-derived peptides: A computationally guided in-vitro and ex-vivo investigation  aInfections of microbial and non-microbial origins have been associated with significant immunological manifestations, thereby underscoring the need for a thorough understanding and investigation of novel immunomodulatory and antioxidant molecules that could prevent these incidences. To this end, we herein aim to identify fermented milk peptides with antioxidant and immunomodulatory properties that could be exploited for specific future applications. Our computational prediction models indicate that these peptides are non-toxic and possess considerable hydrophobicity (19.82–38.96 %) and functionality. Further analyses reveal that two of the four peptides, i.e., Pep 1 (AGWNIPM) and Pep 4 (YLGYLEQLLR), possess higher in-vitro antioxidant activity. The immunomodulatory potential of these two peptides (Pep 1 and Pep 4) is further demonstrated by using a combination of molecular simulation trajectory and ex-vivo approaches. Both peptides demonstrate ability to control the production of pro- inflammatory (TNF-α, IL-1, and IL-6) and anti-inflammatory (IL-10) cytokines as well as nitric oxide release in LPS-stimulated murine peritoneal macrophages. Similarly, peptide interferences also lead to significant (P < 0.05) improvement in macrophage phagocytic capacity. Taken together, these findings highlight the antioxidant and immunomodulatory properties of fermented milk peptides (Pep 1 and Pep 4) within the cellular environment and should facilitate prospective studies exploring such bioactive peptides and related functional molecules mediating the benefits of fermented milk products on human health.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantioxidant activity 3aantioxidants 3afermented milk 3ahuman health 3ahydrophobicity 3ainterleukin-1 3ainterleukin-10 3ainterleukin-6 3amacrophages 3amice 3amolecular dynamics 3anitric oxide 3aprediction 0aMilk peptides 0aFermentation 0aMolecular docking 0aPeptide informatics 0aAntioxidant 0aImmunomodulation1 aNataraj, Basavaprabhu H.1 aKumari, Manorama1 aKadyan, Saurabh1 aPuniya, Anil K.1 aBehare, Pradip V.1 aNagpal, Ravinder0 tPeptides.g2022 Sept., v. 155 p.170843-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:11832x0196-97817nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.peptides.2022.1708433Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02336naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100001800166245009000184300001600274520120000290592002801490650001601518650001501534650002501549650000901574650001401583650001201597650002501609650003501634650000901669650005501678650003001733700001701763700001701780773009601797856004801893852000901941655001201950IND50063039620221122024619.0130324e201303  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006303962DNAL7 a231607422pmid7 a10.1007/s10529-012-1087-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCui, Xiaofeng10aAccelerated myotube formation using bioprinting technology for biosensor applications  ap. 315-321.  aMuscle-powered, biological, microelectro-mechanical system is promising for actuator and biosensor applications. Functional conjugation between the cells, tissues, and biomolecules to the microdevice is crucial for this application. Bioprinting as an enabling technology possesses the advantages of high throughput, digital control, and highly accurate delivery of various biological factors to the desired locations for numerous applications such as 3D tissue fabrication. We have now evaluated the feasibility of the precise placement of mouse myoblasts onto micro-sized cantilevers. The evenly aligned printed cells fused with each other and formed mature myotubes after only 4 days. In contrast, it took more than 14 days for randomly deposited cells to do so. The printed myotubes were functional and responded to the electrical stimulation synchronously. Furthermore, the integrated Bio-MEMS device responded to the chemical stimulation spontaneously which demonstrated the potential as a functional biosensor. The contractility of the system was recovered quickly after the removal of the chemical stimulation, which indicated the flexibility of this system and the recycling potential.  aPublisher supplied data 3abioprinting 3abiosensors 3aelectrical treatment 3amice 3amyoblasts 2aAnimals 2aBioprintingxmethods 2aBiosensing Techniquesxmethods 2aMice 2aMuscle Fibers, Skeletalxdrug effectsxphysiology. 2aTissue Culture Techniques1 aGao, Guifang1 aQiu, Yongjun0 tBiotechnology letters.g2013 Mar., v. 35, no. 3 p.315-321dSpringer-Verlagx0141-54927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10529-012-1087-0  aDNAL 7aarticle02471naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002900151245010800180300001600288520106200304592002801366650002101394650002901415650001201444650002101456650001701477650002101494650001301515650000901528650001801537650002601555650002001581650001801601650001701619650000901636653001801645653002201663653002701685653001901712700003001731700001601761700002101777773010801798856008601906852000901992655001202001IND60540890320221123004713.0190318e20150710xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054089032DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbpol.2015.03.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStraccia, Maria Cristina10aNovel zinc alginate hydrogels prepared by internal setting method with intrinsic antibacterial activity  ap. 103-112.  aIn this paper, a controlled gelation of alginate was performed for the first time using ZnCO3 and GDL.

Homogeneity, water content, swelling capability, water evaporation rate, stability in normal saline solution, mechanical properties and antibacterial activity were assessed as a function of zinc concentration. Gelation rate increased at increasing zinc content, while a decrease in water uptake and an improvement of stability were found. Release of zinc in physiological environments showed that concentration of zinc released in solution lies below the cytotoxicity level. Hydrogels showed antimicrobial activity against Escherichia coli. The hydrogel with highest zinc content was stabilized with calcium by immersion in a calcium chloride solution. The resulting hydrogel preserved homogeneity and antibacterial activity. Furthermore, it showed even an improvement of stability and mechanical properties, which makes it suitable as long-lasting wound dressing.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3aantibacterial properties 3acalcium 3acalcium chloride 3acytotoxicity 3aevaporation rate 3agelation 3agels 3ahydrocolloids 3amechanical properties 3asodium chloride 3awater content 3awater uptake 3azinc 0aZinc alginate 0aInternal gelation 0aAntibacterial activity 0aWound dressing1 ad’Ayala, Giovanna Gomez1 aRomano, Ida1 aLaurienzo, Paola0 tCarbohydrate polymers.g2015 July 10, v. 125 p.103-112dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl47819x0144-86177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbpol.2015.03.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02752naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245013500166500001400301520146600315592002801781650002901809650002701838650001301865650001301878650001501891650001401906650001901920650002101939650001101960650001701971650001401988650001502002650002302017650001702040700001702057700002002074700002302094773012302117856008102240852000902321655001202330IND60724555220221122223006.0210122e20210101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072455522DNAL7 a10.3390/pathogens100100292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAtto, Brianna 10aHaemophilin-Producing Strains of Haemophilus haemolyticus Protect Respiratory Epithelia from NTHi Colonisation and Internalisation  aNAL-light  aNontypeable Haemophilus influenzae (NTHi) is a significant respiratory tract pathogen responsible for infections that collectively pose a substantial health and socioeconomic burden. The clinical course of these infections is largely dictated by NTHi interactions with host respiratory epithelia, and thus, approaches that disrupt colonisation and invasion may have significant therapeutic potential. Survival, successful host–cell interactions, and pathogenesis are reliant on NTHi’s ability to sequester host-derived haem. Previously, we demonstrated the therapeutic potential of exploiting this haem-dependence using a closely related competitor bacterium, Haemophilus haemolyticus (Hh). Hh strains capable of producing the novel haem-binding protein haemophilin (Hpl) possessed potent inhibitory activity by restricting NTHi access to haem in a broth co-culture environment. Here, we extend this work to cell culture models that more closely represent the human respiratory epithelium and show that Hh strains with high levels of hpl expression protect epithelial cell line monolayers against adhesion and invasion by NTHi. Inhibitory activity was dependent on the level of Hpl production, which was stimulated by NTHi challenge and nasopharyngeal cell exposure. Provided these protective benefits translate to in vivo applications, Hpl-producing Hh may have probiotic utility against NTHi infections by inhibiting requisite nasopharyngeal colonisation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHaemophilus haemolyticus 3aHaemophilus influenzae 3aadhesion 3abacteria 3acell lines 3acoculture 3adisease course 3aepithelial cells 3ahumans 3apathogenesis 3apathogens 3aprobiotics 3arespiratory mucosa 3atherapeutics1 aKunde, Dale 1 aGell, David A.,1 aTristram, Stephen 0 tPathogens.g2021 Jan. 01, v. 10, no. 1dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27146x2076-08177nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/pathogens100100293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02906naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100006100151245008800212300001600300520161700316592002801933650002201961650002701983650001002010650001302020650001202033650002002045650001302065650001202078650002402090650001402114650002202128650001302150651001502163653001202178653001502190653001402205653001302219653001102232700002202243773010002265856008602365852000902451655001202460IND60527101120221123004429.0190412e201601  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052710112DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecolind.2015.08.0522doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMeager, Justin J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3349-184110aBycatch and strandings programs as ecological indicators for data-limited cetaceans  ap. 987-995.  aAn integrated approach of using strandings and bycatch data may provide an indicator of long-term trends for data-limited cetaceans. Strandings programs can give a faithful representation of the species composition of cetacean assemblages, while standardised bycatch rates can provide a measure of relative abundance. Comparing the two datasets may also facilitate managing impacts by understanding which species, sex or sizes are the most vulnerable to interactions with fisheries gear. Here we apply this approach to two long-term datasets in East Australia, bycatch in the Queensland Shark Control Program (QSCP, 1992–2012) and strandings in the Queensland Marine Wildlife Strandings and Mortality Program (StrandNet, 1996–2012). Short-beaked common dolphins, Delphinus delphis, were markedly more frequent in bycatch than in the strandings dataset, suggesting that they are more prone to being incidentally caught than other cetacean species in the region. The reverse was true for humpback whales, Megaptera novaeangliae, bottlenose dolphins, Tursiops spp.; and species predominantly found in offshore waters. QSCP bycatch was strongly skewed towards females for short-beaked common dolphins, and towards smaller sizes for Australian humpback dolphins, Sousa sahulensis. Overall, both datasets demonstrated similar seasonality and a similar long-term increase from 1996 until 2008. Analysis on a species-by-species basis was then used to explore potential explanations for long-term trends, which ranged from a recovering stock (humpback whales) to a shift in habitat use (short-beaked common dolphins).  aPublisher supplied data 3aDelphinus delphis 3aMegaptera novaeangliae 3aSousa 3aTursiops 3abycatch 3adata collection 3adolphins 3afemales 3ahabitat preferences 3amortality 3aspecies diversity 3awildlife 3aQueensland 0aBycatch 0aStrandings 0aCetaceans 0aDolphins 0aWhales1 aSumpton, Wayne D.0 tEcological indicators.g2016 Jan., v. 60 p.987-995dElsevier LtdwJournal:6196x1470-160X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2015.08.0523Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02453naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002300149245009000172300001600262520132400278592002801602650001301630650000901643650000901652650001401661650000901675650001801684650001501702650001401717650002201731650002001753650001401773700002401787700001901811700002501830773012001855856008301975852000902058655001202067IND60088149020221119132505.0141102e20121230xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008814902DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jembe.2012.09.0162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJohnson, Jethro S.10aEffect of ingestion on the stable isotope signatures of marine herbivorous fish diets  ap. 137-143.  aStable isotope analysis is widely used to investigate the diet–consumer relationships of free-ranging animals, including fishes. However, measuring the isotope signature of relevant diet items can be problematic when little is known about consumer diet choice, or when individual diet items are difficult to collect in the field. Here we tested the viability of using ingested material as a proxy for fresh diet items in a field study by examining the effect of ingestion on the δ¹⁵N and δ¹³C values of diet items commonly consumed by the marine herbivorous fish Odax pullus (Labridae). Ingestion had a significant effect on the δ¹⁵N or δ¹³C value of three of the five diet items considered. Two diet items showed a clear and consistent change in isotopic signature following ingestion, indicating that discrimination between light and heavy isotopes occurs during the early stages of processing in this stomachless fish. The potential for isotope signatures to change following ingestion suggests that caution should be taken when using ingested material as a proxy for diet items in studies of marine herbivory. Additionally, the predictable effect of ingestion demonstrates the potential for digestion to make a large contribution to the fractionation observed in trophic studies of marine herbivory.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLabridae 3aOdax 3adiet 3adigestion 3afish 3afractionation 3aherbivores 3aingestion 3aprocessing stages 3astable isotopes 3aviability1 aRaubenheimer, David1 aBury, Sarah J.1 aClements, Kendall D.0 tJournal of experimental marine biology and ecology.g2012 Dec. 30, v. 438 p.137-143dElsevier B.V.x0022-09817nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jembe.2012.09.0163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03590naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100001500141245009800156300001600254520221100270592002802481650001802509650001502527650002502542650001402567650001402581650001502595650001702610650001402627650001302641650002202654650002102676650001202697650002302709650001702732650002702749650002102776650002202797650001802819650001302837650001002850650001102860700001502871700001502886773011102901856007503012852000903087655001203096IND60586513520221122114254.0171213s2018    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058651352DNAL7 a10.1071/RDv30n1Ab712doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNiu, Y.-J.10a72 Protective Effects of C-Phycocyanin on the Developmental Competence of Porcine Parthenotes  ap. 174-175.  aC-Phycocyanin (CP) is a biliprotein enriched in blue-green algae that is known to possess antioxidant, anti-apoptosis, anti-inflammatory, and radical-scavenging properties in somatic cells. However, the protective effect of CP on porcine embryo developmental competence in vitro remains unclear. In the present study, we investigated the effect of CP on the development of porcine early embryos as well as its underlying mechanisms exposing them to H2O2 to induce oxidative stress. The levels of reactive oxygen species, mitochondrial membrane potential, apoptosis, DNA damage, and autophagy in the blastocysts were observed by staining with 2′,7′-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (H2DCF-DA), 5,5′,6,6’-tetrachloro-1,1′,3,3′-tetraethyl-imidacarbocyanine iodide (JC-1), terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated 2′-deoxyuridine 5′-triphosphate (dUTP) nick-end labelling (TUNEL), anti-cytochrome c, and anti-γH2A.X (Ser139), respectively. Colocalization assay of mitochondria and cytochrome c of blastocysts were staining with MitoTracker Red CMXRos and anti-cytochrome c. All data were subjected to one-way ANOVA. Different concentrations of CP (1, 2, 5, 8, 10 µgmL-1) were added to porcine zygote medium 5 (PZM-5, l-glutamine concentration of PZM-3 was modified from 1 to 2mM) during in vitro culture. The results showed that 5 µgmL-1 CP significantly increased blastocyst formation (62.5±2.1v. 52.7±2.4; P<0.05) and hatching rate (10.9±1.9v. 36.6±5.2; P<0.05) compared with controls. Blastocyst formation (53.1±2.3v. 40.1±2.3; P<0.05) and quality were significantly increased in the 50 µM H2O2 treatment group following 5 µgmL-1 CP addition. C-Phycocyanin prevented the H2O2-induced compromise of mitochondrial membrane potential, release of cytochrome c from the mitochondria, and generation of reactive oxygen species. Furthermore, apoptosis, DNA damage level, and autophagy in the blastocysts were attenuated by supplementation of CP in the H2O2-induced oxidative injury group compared with that in controls. These results suggest that CP has beneficial effects on the development of porcine parthenotes by attenuating mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCyanobacteria 3aDNA damage 3aanalysis of variance 3aapoptosis 3aautophagy 3ablastocyst 3acytochrome c 3aglutamine 3ahatching 3ahydrogen peroxide 3ain vitro culture 3aiodides 3amembrane potential 3amitochondria 3amitochondrial membrane 3aoxidative stress 3aprotective effect 3asomatic cells 3astaining 3aswine 3azygote1 aKim, N.-H.1 aCui, X.-S.0 tReproduction, fertility, and development.g2018, v. 30, no. 1 p.174-175dCSIRO Publishingx1031-36137nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1071/RDv30n1Ab713Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02813naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003800113040001800151100001700169245009200186300001800278520126700296592002801563650001501591650001701606650001601623650002901639650001901668650001901687650001701706650002001723650002101743650001701764650001801781650002101799650002701820650004501847650003501892650002101927650004801948650001701996650002102013650003202034650002802066700001602094700001602110773008802126856008402214852000902298655001202307IND60088195420221117041142.0141102e201102  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008819542DNAL7 a211675492pmid7 a10.1016/j.watres.2010.11.0242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDrikas, Mary10aLong term case study of MIEX pre-treatment in drinking water; understanding NOM removal  ap. 1539-1548.  aRemoval of natural organic matter (NOM) is a key requirement to improve drinking water quality. This study compared the removal of NOM with, and without, the patented magnetic ion exchange process for removal of dissolved organic carbon (MIEX DOC) as a pre-treatment to microfiltration or conventional coagulation treatment over a 2 year period. A range of techniques were used to characterise the NOM of the raw and treated waters. MIEX pre-treatment produced water with lower concentration of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and lower specific UV absorbance (SUVA). The processes incorporating MIEX also produced more consistent water quality and were less affected by changes in the concentration and character of the raw water DOC. The very hydrophobic acid fraction (VHA) was the dominant NOM component in the raw water and was best removed by MIEX pre-treatment, regardless of the raw water VHA concentration. MIEX pre-treatment also produced water with lower weight average apparent molecular weight (AMW) and with the greatest reduction in complexity and range of NOM. A strong correlation was found between the VHA content and weight average AMW confirming that the VHA fraction was a major component of the NOM for both the raw water and treated waters.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorbance 3acase studies 3acoagulation 3adissolved organic carbon 3adrinking water 3ahydrophobicity 3aion exchange 3amicrofiltration 3amolecular weight 3apretreatment 3awater quality 2aCarbonxanalysis 2aChemical Fractionation 2aHydrophobic and Hydrophilic Interactions 2aIon Exchange Resinsxchemistry 2aMolecular Weight 2aOrganic Chemicalsxisolation & purification 2aTime Factors 2aUltraviolet Rays 2aWater Purificationxmethods 2aWater Supplyxanalysis.1 aDixon, Mike1 aMorran, Jim0 tWater research.g2011 Feb., v. 45, no. 4 p.1539-1548dElsevier Ltdx0043-13547nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.watres.2010.11.0243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02773naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001700149245010000166500001400266520158500280592002801865650001601893650001901909650001101928650001401939650002101953650002501974650002301999650001602022650001902038650002002057650001202077651001002089700001802099700001802117700001402135773013402149856008302283852000902366655001202375IND60721524820221119112315.0201224e20201213xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072152482DNAL7 a10.3390/agriculture101206292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShao, Liqun 10aEffects of Social Network on Herder Livestock Production Income and the Mediation by Fund Loans  aNAL-light  aDue to its alpine geography and harsh environment, the pastoral region of Qinghai Province is widely recognized as one of China’s concentrated and contiguous poverty-stricken regions, while climate change, market competition and grazing control exert further pressure on the income security of herders. After more than 1000 years of nomadic practice, cooperation and reciprocity have been entrenched in the culture of pastoral ethnic minorities, in which a well-developed social network may play a crucial role in herders’ social and economic activities, including their financial and production behaviors. Based on a questionnaire survey of 278 households in two counties of Qinghai, this study empirically examined the effects of herders’ social network on their livestock production income and the mediation function of fund loans therein. The social network was found to exert a significant positive impact on household income, and loans had a positive mediation effect. By comparison, the mediation effect of formal borrowing channels was statistically significant while that of informal channels was not, which may be attributed to the relative degree of maturity of the two disparate financial markets. It is suggested that a closer and more inclusive social network should be fostered, the quality of bank financial services should be improved, and the regulation on informal credit activities should be reinforced, so as to fully exploit the positive roles of the social network and fund loans for income growth of herder households in vast pastoral areas of China.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagriculture 3aclimate change 3acredit 3ageography 3ahousehold income 3alivestock production 3amarket competition 3apastoralism 3aquestionnaires 3asocial networks 3asurveys 3aChina1 aZhou, Yimeng 1 aChen, Haibin 1 aWang, Yu 0 tAgriculture (Basel).g2020 Dec. 13, v. 10, no. 12dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:12387x2077-04727nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agriculture101206293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02417naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100002200112245013800134300001600272520130800288592002801596650002601624650002201650650001701672650001301689650001501702650001401717650001901731650002101750650001501771651001301786653001501799653002601814653002801840653002401868700001701892773012501909852000902034655001202043IND60738447120221120140953.0210524e202102  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073844712DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMuhammed, Annissa10aFloristic composition, diversity, and structure in the changing landscape of the Bale Mountains National Park, South-eastern Ethiopia  ap. 204-209.  aBale mountains national park (BMNP) is one of the 34 International Biodiversity Hotspots that comprise a variety of life forms. However, it faces a critical challenge from illegal settlements and livestock grazing. This study aimed to estimate the plant composition and structure in the changing landscape of BMNP. The vegetation and environmental data were collected systematically from 96 plots laid along 24 line transects. Vegetation hierarchical clustering and landscape structural analysis were made using R software version 3.5.2 and FRAGSTATS version 4.2.1, respectively. A total of 205 species that belongs to 153 genera and 71 families were identified. The overall Shannon diversity and evenness index was 4.34 and 0.81, respectively. Both species richness and Shannon diversity index were significantly higher in the edge habitat than the interior at p <0.05. However, the basal area was higher in the interior habitat (173.79 m² ha⁻¹) compared to the edge (64.15 m ha). This study revealed that BMNP is a biologically diverse and ecologically significant area that provides a variety of ecological and economic benefits to the surrounding communities. Though its habitats are changing alarmingly and urgent restoration and conservation action needs to be taken to reverse this situation.  aPublisher supplied data 3abotanical composition 3acomputer software 3aedge effects 3ahabitats 3alandscapes 3alivestock 3anational parks 3aspecies richness 3avegetation 3aEthiopia 0aBasal area 0aFloristic composition 0aHierarchical clustering 0aIllegal settlements1 aElias, Eyasu0 tIndian journal of ecology.g2021 Feb., v. 48, no. 1 p.204-209dIndian Ecological SocietywJournal:16635x0304-52507nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle03481naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100001500137245014100152300001800293500001900311500002000330520184200350592002802192596005902220650001802279650001902297650001902316650001702335650001502352650001602367650001602383650001602399650001702415650001602432650001802448650001102466650001702477650001502494650002002509650001002529700001802539700001902557700001302576700001502589700001302604700001702617700001702634700001502651700005502666773012602721856007102847852000902918655001202927IND60738372720221119222032.0210524e202106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073837272DNAL7 a10.1002/ps.62992doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGao, Xueke10aCharacterization and comparison of the bacterial microbiota of Lysiphlebia japonica parasitioid wasps and their aphid host Aphis gosypii  ap. 2710-2718.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aBACKGROUND: Endosymbiotic bacteria have been reported to mediate interactions between parasitoids and their insect hosts. How parasitic wasps influence changes in host microbial communities and the relationship between them are of great importance to the study of host‐parasitoid co‐evolutionary and ecological interactions. However, these interactions remain largely unreported for interactions between Aphis gossypii and Lysiphlebia japonica. RESULTS: In this study, we characterize the bacterial microbiota of L. japonica wasps at different developmental stages and monitor changes over time in the bacterial microbiota of their parasitized and nonparasitized aphid hosts, using metagenomic analysis of 16S rDNA sequencing data. Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, and Actinobacteria were the three most abundant bacterial phyla identified in L. japonica. We found that parasitism was associated with an increased abundance of Buchnera nutritional endosymbionts, but decreased abundance of Acinetobacter, Arsenophonus, Candidatus_Hamiltonella, and Pseudomonas facultative symbionts in aphid hosts. Functional analysis of enriched pathways of parasitized aphids showed significant differences in the ‘transport and metabolism of carbohydrates’ and ‘amino acid, lipid, and coenzyme biosynthesis’ pathways. Notably, the composition of symbiotic bacteria in wasp larvae was highly similar to that of their aphid hosts, especially the high abundance of Buchnera. CONCLUSION: The results provide a conceptual framework for L. japonica interactions with A. gossypii in which the exchange of symbiotic microbes provides a means by which microbiota can potentially serve as evolutionary drivers of complex, multilevel interactions underlying the ecology and co‐evolution of these hosts and parasites. © 2021 Society of Chemical Industry  aPublisher supplied data  a31572015cNational Natural Science Foundation of China 3aAcinetobacter 3aActinobacteria 3aAphis gossypii 3aArsenophonus 3aFirmicutes 3aLysiphlebia 3aPseudomonas 3aamino acids 3abiosynthesis 3acoevolution 3aendosymbionts 3alipids 3ametagenomics 3aparasitism 3apest management 3awasps1 aNiu, Ruichang1 aZhu, Xiangzhen1 aWang, Li1 aJi, Jichao1 aNiu, Lin1 aWu, Changcai1 aZhang, Shuai1 aLuo, Junyu1 aCui, Jinjie1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5276-43930 tPest management science.g2021 June, v. 77, no. 6 p.2710-2718dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.wJournal:jnl59519x1526-498X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ps.62993Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03052naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002200149245010300171500001400274520184400288592002802132650001202160650001602172650001702188650002502205650001102230650001102241650001102252650000702263650002202270650001102292650002602303650001002329651001002339700002102349700002002370700002602390773013402416856008302550852000902633655001202642IND60721524920221119112627.0201224e20201214xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072152492DNAL7 a10.3390/agriculture101206302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTarricone, Luigi 14aThe Impact of Early Basal Leaf Removal at Different Sides of the Canopy on Aglianico Grape Quality  aNAL-light  aIt is known that early removal of basal leaves improves the exposure of cluster to direct sunlight and UV radiation, which positively influence the phenolic compounds and anthocyanin concentration of berries. This study was carried out to evaluate the effect of leaf removal applied before flowering to the basal zone of the canopy at different sides (fruit-zone north canopy side, south canopy side and north–south canopy side, respectively) of Aglianico vines trained to vertical shoot position system and row oriented to east–west (EW). The study was conducted in the controlled and guaranteed designation of origin (CGDO) Castel del Monte area (Apulia region, Italy). The treatment did not affect yield per vine, and nor sugar, pH, and total acidity of grapes. When it was applied to the basal south canopy side, the concentration of proanthocyanidins and total polyphenols of grapes increased, as well as antioxidant activity. In particular, anthocyanins content, determined by HPLC, increased by 20% with respect to control when treatment was applied to south and north–south canopy sides. Interaction between season period and treatment was found for all anthocyanins except for petunidin-3-coumaroyl-glucoside. Basal leaf removal applied to the north canopy side caused an increase in malvidin-3-O-glucoside content in grapes in 2016 and 2018, but not in 2017. Our results indicate that basal leaf removal (six basal leaves removed from the base of the shoots) before flowering (BBCH 57) can be used as an effective strategy to improve grape total polyphenols, anthocyanins concentration and antioxidant activity in vineyards cultivated under warm climate conditions. The treatment could represent a sustainable alternative to manual cluster thinning since it does not reduce yield per vine and can be performed mechanically.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacidity 3aagriculture 3aanthocyanins 3aantioxidant activity 3acanopy 3agrapes 3aleaves 3apH 3aproanthocyanidins 3asugars 3aultraviolet radiation 3avines 3aItaly1 aFaccia, Michele 1 aMasi, Gianvito 1 aGambacorta, Giuseppe 0 tAgriculture (Basel).g2020 Dec. 14, v. 10, no. 12dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:12387x2077-04727nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agriculture101206303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01952naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100003400149245006400183500001400247520101600261592002801277650001601305650001201321650001001333650001501343650002001358650001801378700002801396773013401424856008301558852000901641655001201650IND60721525020221119112406.0201224e20201214xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072152502DNAL7 a10.3390/agriculture101206312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEl Didamony, Mohamed  Ibrahim10aFabrication and Evaluation of a Cabbage Harvester Prototype  aNAL-light  aA cabbage harvester prototype was fabricated and tested to save time, cost, and labor for harvesting. This harvester was designed for harvesting operations to drive the prototype and control the harvester. The single-row prototype harvesting meets the functional requirements of the physical properties of the Egyptian cabbage. The performance of the harvester prototype was evaluated on two shapes of cutter disc, four cutter disc speeds, and four cutter disc angles; these parameters were assessed at 88% moisture content of the cabbage head and average forward speed of 1.5 km/h. The results demonstrated that the serrated edge cutter discs and 900 rpm disc speed produced actual productivity of 12.56 ton/h, 2.28 kW power requirements, 0.18 kW h/ton specific energy requirement, and of 3.66 $/h operating cost. It turns out that the harvester did not do major harm to the cabbage and less than 4% damage. Operating the harvester at the optimum parameters saves cost and time compared with manual harvesting.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagriculture 3acabbage 3alabor 3aprototypes 3aspecific energy 3awater content1 aEl Shal, Ahmed  Mohamed0 tAgriculture (Basel).g2020 Dec. 14, v. 10, no. 12dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:12387x2077-04727nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agriculture101206313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03218naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001900149245009500168500001400263520184400277592002802121650002202149650001002171650001602181650002002197650002002217650002502237650001402262650001502276650001702291650001402308650002102322650001902343650001502362650002602377650000902403650002402412650002502436650002502461700002202486700002602508773013402534856008302668852000902751655001202760IND60721525120221119112242.0201224e20201214xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072152512DNAL7 a10.3390/agriculture101206322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOhta, Kousaku 10aSecondary Metabolite Differences between Naturally Grown and Conventional Coarse Green Tea  aNAL-light  aCrop culture conditions are one of the important interfaces between food, the environment, and health, and an essential research area for maintaining social-ecological integrity. In recent years, it has been reported that the difference in culture conditions between monoculture with external inputs (in cultura) and self-organized ecological niches (in natura) is significant for the resulting physiological property of plants. It has also been suggested that there exist metabolic proxies in various foods that can separate these two culture conditions, which does not depend on a single component but on the distribution of various compounds. However, little has been studied in a time series of replicated production to quantify the reproducibility of these metabolomic features associated with culture conditions. In this study, we obtained metabolome data of coarse green tea (Camellia sinensis) grown in the same region in Japan under both in cultura and in natura culture conditions over the course of six years, and constructed a list of multiple components that separated the effects of culture conditions by statistical analysis, and estimated the metabolic functions of the compounds that contributed to the separation. The results suggest that naturally grown samples are rich in allelochemicals, such as phytochemicals, alkaloids, phenylpropanoids, steroids, as well as the compounds related to microorganisms and vitamin B6 that imply the interactions with the soil microbiome. The estimated physiological functions of the distinctive compounds suggest that the in natura crop production is not only beneficial with known properties of maintaining ecosystem health such as soil functions and pathogen control, but also for the augmentation of the plant secondary metabolites that support long-term health protective effects.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCamellia sinensis 3aJapan 3aagriculture 3aallelochemicals 3acrop production 3aenvironmental health 3agreen tea 3ametabolome 3ametabolomics 3apathogens 3aphenylpropanoids 3aphytochemicals 3apyridoxine 3asecondary metabolites 3asoil 3asoil microorganisms 3astatistical analysis 3atime series analysis1 aKawaoka, Tatsuya 1 aFunabashi, Masatoshi 0 tAgriculture (Basel).g2020 Dec. 14, v. 10, no. 12dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:12387x2077-04727nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agriculture101206323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02703naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002300150245015200173500001900325520119500344592002801539650001501567650001901582650002501601650000901626650001101635650001201646650001301658653003001671653001301701653002401714653001601738653002401754653001901778653002501797653002601822700002001848700002501868700002301893700002001916700002101936700002501957700001601982700002701998773009002025856008502115852000902200655001202209IND60707535720221118223843.0201024e20201101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070753572DNAL7 a10.1016/j.energy.2020.1185752doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAbunowara, Mustafa10aExperimental measurements of carbon dioxide, methane and nitrogen high-pressure adsorption properties onto Malaysian coals under various conditions  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aIn this study, the CO₂ adsorption capacity was measured on Malaysian sub-bituminous coals in dry and moisture equilibrated state using volumetric technique to understand its carbon sequestration and storage potential. The CO₂ adsorption capacity onto dry and wet coal samples was performed at 300–348 K and 6 MPa. Four coal specimens, namely S1, S2, S3 and S4 were analysed by using BET, XRD and FESEM techniques before and after CO₂ adsorption. The dry S3 coal had showed the highest CO₂ adsorption capacity 1.59 mmol g⁻¹ at 300 K and 6 MPa among all samples. FTIR spectra patterns explain this behaviour as they showed an excessive presence of hydroxyl and carboxyl functional groups in dry coal samples. The functional group analysis of all the wet coal samples exposed to CO₂ showed significantly declined adsorption relative to their corresponding dry samples. The mineral phases were identified within all fresh and wet exposed coal samples to CO₂ through XRD analysis. The S3 coal had the highest selectivity of CO₂ over CH₄ and N₂ gases at pressures up to 6 MPa. The bituminous Malaysian coal has a high affinity to adsorb CO₂ in dry and wet conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3acarbon dioxide 3acarbon sequestration 3acoal 3aenergy 3amethane 3anitrogen 0aFunctional group analysis 0aMoisture 0aCoal CO2 adsorption 0aSelectivity 0aCH4 and N2 wet coal 0aMalaysian coal 0aVolumetric technique 0aFTIR spectra Patterns1 aSufian, Suriati1 aBustam, Mohamad Azmi1 aEldemerdash, Usama1 aSuleman, Humbul1 aBencini, Roberto1 aAssiri, Mohammed Ali1 aUllah, Sami1 aAl-Sehemi, Abdullah G.0 tEnergy.g2020 Nov. 01, v. 210 p.118575-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12436x0360-54427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2020.1185753Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02165naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002300144245007300167300001600240500002000256520106900276592002801345650001201373650001101385650001101396650002201407650002101429650001701450650001901467650001701486650001401503700002201517700002101539700001901560700002101579773009201600856007801692852000901770655001201779IND60549754220221116143359.0160908e201609  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054975422DNAL7 a10.1002/bies.2016000892doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMartin, William F.10aEnergy for two: New archaeal lineages and the origin of mitochondria  ap. 850-856.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aMetagenomics bears upon all aspects of microbiology, including our understanding of mitochondrial and eukaryote origin. Recently, ribosomal protein phylogenies show the eukaryote host lineage – the archaeal lineage that acquired the mitochondrion – to branch within the archaea. Metagenomic studies are now uncovering new archaeal lineages that branch more closely to the host than any cultivated archaea do. But how do they grow? Carbon and energy metabolism as pieced together from metagenome assemblies of these new archaeal lineages, such as the Deep Sea Archaeal Group (including Lokiarchaeota) and Bathyarchaeota, do not match the physiology of any cultivated microbes. Understanding how these new lineages live in their environment is important, and might hold clues about how mitochondria arose and how the eukaryotic lineage got started. Here we look at these exciting new metagenomic studies, what they say about archaeal physiology in modern environments, how they impact views on host‐mitochondrion physiological interactions at eukaryote origin.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArchaea 3acarbon 3aenergy 3aenergy metabolism 3aeukaryotic cells 3ametagenomics 3amicroorganisms 3amitochondria 3aphylogeny1 aNeukirchen, Sinje1 aZimorski, Verena1 aGould, Sven B.1 aSousa, Filipa L.0 tBioEssays.g2016 Sept., v. 38, no. 9 p.850-856dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltdx0265-92477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/bies.2016000893Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03842naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100003000139245014800169300001600317500001400333500002000347520223000367592002802597650002602625650001902651650002802670650001602698650001602714650001402730650001902744650001302763650001702776650001002793650001502803650002602818650001402844650001102858650001902869650001902888650001002907650001702917650001302934650001102947700002102958700003002979700002603009700007103035773012403106856007303230852000903303655001203312IND60718285720221120050613.0201124e202012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071828572DNAL7 a10.1111/ppl.131952doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEinhardt, Andersom Milech10aGlyphosate and nickel differently affect photosynthesis and ethylene in glyphosate‐resistant soybean plants infected by Phakopsora pachyrhizi  ap. 592-606.  aNAL-light  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aNickel (Ni) and glyphosate (Gl) are able to reduce the symptoms of Asian soybean rust (ASR), caused by Phakopsora pachyrhizi, in soybean. However, their combined effects on the energy balance and ethylene metabolism of soybean plants infected with this fungus has not been elucidated. Therefore, the effects of Ni, Gl, and the combination of Ni + Gl on ASR development, photosynthetic capacity, sugar concentrations, and ethylene concentrations in plants of a Gl‐resistant cultivar, uninfected or infected with P. pachyrhizi, were investigated. Inoculated plants supplied with Ni had the highest foliar Ni concentration in all the treatments. Gl had a negative effect on the foliar Ni concentration in Ni‐sprayed plants. The ASR severity was reduced in plants sprayed with Ni and Gl. Carotenoid and chlorophyll concentrations were higher in inoculated Ni, Gl, and Ni + Gl plants than in control plants. Based on the chlorophyll a fluorescence parameters, the photosynthetic apparatus of the control inoculated plants was damaged, and the least amount of energy was directed to the photochemistry process in these plants. The reduced capacity of the photosynthetic mechanism to capture light and use the energy absorbed by photosystem II in inoculated plants was reflected in their reduced capacity to process CO₂, as indicated by the high internal CO₂ concentrations and low rates of net carbon assimilation. The low sugar concentrations in inoculated plants from the control treatment were linked to their reduced photosynthetic capacity due to the high ASR severity. In uninfected plants, the ethylene concentration was not affected by Ni or Gl, while the ethylene concentration decreased in inoculated plants; this decrease was more pronounced in plants from the control treatment than in treated inoculated plants. In conclusion, this study sheds light on the role played by both Ni and Gl in ASR control from a physiological perspective. Soybean plants exposed to Ni and Gl were able to maintain high ethylene concentrations and photosynthetic capacity during the P. pachyrhizi infection process; as a result, these plants consumed less of their reserves than inoculated plants not treated with Ni or Gl.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPhakopsora pachyrhizi 3acarbon dioxide 3acarbon dioxide fixation 3acarotenoids 3achlorophyll 3acultivars 3aenergy balance 3aethylene 3afluorescence 3afungi 3aglyphosate 3aglyphosate resistance 3ainfection 3anickel 3aphotochemistry 3aphotosystem II 3asheds 3asoybean rust 3asoybeans 3asugars1 aFerreira, Sandro1 aOliveira, Lillian Mathias1 aRibeiro, Dimas Mendes1 aRodrigues, Fabrício Ávila1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3091-00000 tPhysiologia plantarum.g2020 Dec., v. 170, no. 4 p.592-606dBlackwell Publishing LtdwJournal:jnl52817x0031-93177nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ppl.131953Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03671naa a2200865 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100003800147245018500185300001300370520129100383592002801674650002701702650002601729650001001755650002501765650001701790650002101807650001101828650001601839650001101855650001901866650002901885650001301914650001401927650001601941650001701957650001201974650001501986650001202001650001502013650001202028653001702040653001702057653001502074653001502089653001502104653002002119653000902139653000902148653001002157653000802167653000902175653000802184653000902192653000702201653000802208653000802216653001002224653000802234653000802242653000802250653000902258653001302267653001802280653000802298653000802306653000802314653001002322653001002332700002002342700003202362700002902394700008202423700003402505700001702539700002402556773012202580856008202702852000902784655001202793IND60525787820221117201512.0190401e201606  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052578782DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fct.2016.03.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNúñez-Sánchez, María Ángeles10aIn vivo relevant mixed urolithins and ellagic acid inhibit phenotypic and molecular colon cancer stem cell features: A new potentiality for ellagitannin metabolites against cancer  ap. 8-16.  aColon cancer stem cells (CSCs) offer a novel paradigm for colorectal cancer (CRC) treatment and dietary polyphenols may contribute to battle these cells. Specifically, polyphenol-derived colon metabolites have the potential to interact with and affect colon CSCs. We herein report the effects against colon CSCs of two mixtures of ellagitannin (ET) metabolites, ellagic acid (EA) and the gut microbiota-derived urolithins (Uro) at concentrations detected in the human colon tissues following the intake of ET-containing products (pomegranate, walnuts). These mixtures reduce phenotypic and molecular features in two models of colon CSCs: Caco-2 cells and primary tumour cells from a patient with CRC. The mixture containing mostly Uro-A (85% Uro-A, 10% Uro-C, 5% EA) was most effective at inhibiting the number and size of colonospheres and aldehyde dehydrogenase activity (ALDH, a marker of chemoresistance) whereas the mixture containing less Uro-A but IsoUro-A and Uro-B (30% Uro-A, 50% IsoUro-A, 10% Uro-B, 5% Uro-C, 5% EA) had some effects on the number and size of colonospheres but not on ALDH. These data support a role for polyphenols metabolites in the control of colon cancer chemoresistance and relapse and encourage the research on the effects of polyphenols against CSCs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaldehyde dehydrogenase 3aantineoplastic agents 3acolon 3acolorectal neoplasms 3aellagic acid 3ahuman cell lines 3ahumans 3ametabolites 3amodels 3aneoplasm cells 3anutritional intervention 3apatients 3aphenotype 3apolyphenols 3apomegranates 3arelapse 3astem cells 3atissues 3atoxicology 3awalnuts 0aColon cancer 0aEllagic acid 0aUrolithins 0aStem cells 0aMetabotype 0aChemoprevention 0aALDH 0aATCC 0aCD133 0aCRC 0aCSCs 0aDHC 0aDMEM 0aEA 0aEGF 0aMEM 0aEpCAM 0aETs 0aFCS 0aFGF 0aHBSS 0aIsoUro-A 0aMPhA and MPhB 0aSCM 0aSEM 0aUro 0aUro-A 0aUro-B1 aKarmokar, Ankur1 aGonzález-Sarrías, Antonio1 aGarcía-Villalba, Rocío1 aTomas-Barberan, F.

Abscisic acid (ABA), salicylic acid (SA), indole‐3‐acetic acid (IAA), and jasmonates (JAs), including jasmonic acid (JA), jasmonoyl‐l‐isoleucine (JA‐Ile), and cis‐OPDA have been simultaneously identified and quantitated by UHPLC–MS/MS in pepper leaf tissue harvested at 3, 8 hours post‐infestation (hpi), 1, 2, 4 and 7 days post‐infestation (dpi). Infested plants showed a reduction in stem length at 7 dpi and in the number of leaves and leaf width from 4 dpi onwards. JA and JA‐Ile significantly increased very early (from 3 hpi) while SA only accumulated at 7 dpi. Despite the high density of infestation, the aphid‐induced accumulation of JAs was much lower than the burst typically induced by chewing herbivores. On the other side, ABA peaked in aphid‐infested plants at 2 and 4 dpi, while IAA content did not change significantly at any time point. Growth inhibition may be partially explained by the high levels of JAs found in aphid‐infested plants. The possibility that the obtained results support the hypothesis of the aphid manipulation of plant metabolism is discussed.  aPublisher supplied data  aProject CGL2016‐79054‐RcMinisterio de Economía y Competitividad of Spain  aNPU I program with project LO1204cMinistry of Education, Youth and Sports of the Czech Republic  agrant UAFPU2013‐5793cUniversidad de Alicante 3aCapsicum annuum 3aMyzus persicae 3aabscisic acid 3adensity 3agrowth retardation 3aherbivores 3aindole acetic acid 3ajasmonic acid 3aleaf width 3aleaves 3alength 3amastication 3ametabolism 3asalicylic acid 3asweet peppers1 aNovák, Ondřej1 aCasas, José L.0 tPhysiologia plantarum.g2020 Dec., v. 170, no. 4 p.519-527dBlackwell Publishing LtdwJournal:jnl52817x0031-93177nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ppl.131883Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03229naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001900139245010400158300001600262500002000278520182400298592002802122650001902150650001502169650002302184650001102207650001502218650002102233650001702254650001502271650001602286650001402302650002002316650001502336650001602351650001702367650001402384650001402398650001202412651001402424651001602438651002102454700002502475700002302500773010502523856007302628961001302701852000902714655001202723IND60549754420221116143339.0160908e201610  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054975442DNAL7 a10.1111/een.123402doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aASIIMWE, PETER10aNatural enemy impacts on Bemisia tabaci (MEAM1) dominate plant quality effects in the cotton system  ap. 642-652.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  a1. Plant quality (bottom‐up effects) and natural enemies (top‐down effects) affect herbivore performance. Furthermore, plant quality can also influence the impact of natural enemies. 2. Lower plant quality through reduced irrigation increased the abundance of the cryptic species from the Bemisia tabaci complex [hereafter B. tabaci Middle East Asia Minor 1 (MEAM1)], but not its natural enemies on cotton. It was therefore predicted that lower plant quality would diminish the impact of natural enemies in regulating this herbivore. 3. Over three cotton seasons, plant quality was manipulated via differential irrigation and natural enemy abundance with insecticides. Life tables were used to evaluate the impact of these factors on mortality of immature B. tabaci (MEAM1) over nine generations. 4. Mortality of B. tabaci (MEAM1) was consistently affected by natural enemies but not by plant quality. This pattern was driven by high levels of sucking predation, which was the primary (key) factor associated with changes in immature mortality across all irrigation and natural enemy treatments. Dislodgement (chewing predation and weather) and parasitism contributed as key factors in some cases. Analyses also showed that elimination of sucking predation and dislodgement would have the greatest effect on overall mortality. 5. The top‐down effects of natural enemies had dominant effects on populations of B. tabaci (MEAM1) relative to the bottom‐up effects of plant quality. Effects were primarily due to native generalist arthropod predators and not more host‐specific aphelinid parasitoids. The findings of this study demonstrate the important role of arthropod predators in population suppression and validate the importance of conservation biological control in this system for effective pest control.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBemisia tabaci 3aarthropods 3abiological control 3acotton 3aherbivores 3ahost specificity 3ainsecticides 3airrigation 3alife tables 3amortality 3anatural enemies 3aparasitism 3aparasitoids 3apest control 3apredation 3apredators 3aweather 3aEast Asia 3aMiddle East 3aTurkey (country)1 aEllsworth, Peter C.,1 aNARANJO, STEVEN E.0 tEcological entomology.g2016 Oct., v. 41, no. 5 p.642-652dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0307-69467nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/een.123403Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/ARS  aDNAL 7aarticle04873naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100006200140245007100202500002000273520329500293592002803588650002403616650002503640650002103665650002003686650001403706650001203720650001203732650002003744650002003764650001803784650001503802650002003817650001103837650001503848650002103863650002403884650002003908650001103928650002103939650002503960650001903985650001204004651000904016700002504025700002204050700001704072700002404089773013504113856007404248852000904322655001204331IND60672472820221119233745.0191016e201910  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067247282DNAL7 a10.1111/jfpe.131712doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPaladini, Edson P.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8651-097010aQuality management model for perishable food in a fishing industry  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aAs in other developing countries, the fishing industry has a great social and economic impact in Cuba. In fact, this sector generates income in foreign currency, provides for its own investments, and finances priority economic and social programs of the country. In the last 5 years, Cuba covered 100% of the domestic market demand of the sector as well as the needs of the tourism and export sectors. This article presents a study in the Cuban food sector, specifically in the fish processing industry, with a goal of reducing losses with the implementation of improvements, according to the technological‐organizational base. The Knowledge‐level model, based on the comprehension of the process, establishes guidelines to manage quality. It is developed in the shrimp industry, which contributes 80% of the exportable products in the analyzed industry. The causes of the most frequent defects were associated with ineffectiveness in relations with suppliers and with temperature regulation in the reception tank. The Taguchi Loss Function quantified an improvement potential by the effect “temperature.” In a defect depending on this parameter, in values around the upper limit of specification (2°C), the losses presented were 4.5 times higher than those in the interval 1.3–1.4°C, thus proving to be the most effective for its regulation. The Variation Mode and Effect Analysis assessed the incidence of variability in the export capacity. It was obtained in order of priority: environment, equipment, and employees. The most important noise factor was equipment. Related to this, the ice plant presented the most representative failure modes, 66% of which can be resolved by maintenance. This improvement alternative improves the process by attenuating the ambient temperature effect. The technical availability has been increased, the process was properly documented, and these actions have strengthened the motivation of the personnel integral to the study, based on the organization of the quality department and the productive area. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: This study shows a practical model designed to reduce losses in the industrial sector of fish production and processing. The model uses Quality Management tools and its development follows a simple and well‐defined roadmap. The technical support of the model derives from well‐accepted statistical methods. The model was directed and focused on industrial activities related to fish processing in general, with an emphasis on the analysis of shrimp production; it takes into account the typical characteristics of highly perishable products. The results obtained demonstrate significant financial gains with the minimization of losses that generally occur in the processing of perishable products. This article presents a study in the fish processing industry with a goal of reducing losses with the implementation of improvements, according to the technological‐organizational base. The knowledge‐level model described here is based on the comprehension of the process and it establishes guidelines to manage quality. The causes of the most frequent defects were associated with ineffectiveness in relations with suppliers and with inadequate control of important actions and variables of the process.  aPublisher supplied data 3aambient temperature 3adeveloping countries 3adomestic markets 3aeconomic impact 3aequipment 3aexports 3afinance 3afish processing 3afish production 3afood industry 3aguidelines 3ahuman resources 3aincome 3amotivation 3aperishable foods 3aperishable products 3aquality control 3ashrimp 3ashrimp fisheries 3astatistical analysis 3asupply balance 3atourism 3aCuba1 aAvilés, Bismayda G.1 aSchumacher, Luisa1 aLorenz, Mike1 aUrquiza, Yoislan R.0 tJournal of food process engineering.g2019 Oct., v. 42, no. 6 p.e13171-dJohn Wiley & Sons, Inc.wJournal:jnl8651x0145-88767nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jfpe.131713Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02533naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001700140245008200157300001800239520111500257592002801372650000801400650001101408650002201419650002301441650001301464650001301477650002101490650001901511650001701530650001401547650001101561650001601572650001501588650001301603650001601616700002601632700002901658700002401687700002901711700001901740700001901759700002901778700002801807773012101835856007401956852000902030655001202039IND60667050320221121092611.0190919e20141217xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066705032DNAL7 a10.1039/c4ra12660b2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGusmão, Rui10aEnhanced electrochemical sensing of polyphenols by an oxygen-mediated surface  ap. 5024-5031.  aWe report a straightforward heat treatment in air of commercial screen-printed carbon electrodes (SPCE) at different temperatures and times (ht-SPCE) that produces considerable electrocatalytic effects. The active area and the presence of oxygen groups on the ht-SPCE surface increased upon thermal treatment, more than doubling and by 20%, respectively. The increase of oxygen-containing carbon surface groups results in strong interactions and substantial improvement in Faradaic currents, up to a 10 fold increase in the voltammetric response of relevant polyphenols (hydroquinone, catechol, pyrogallol and dopamine). Moreover, ht-SPCE displayed higher selectivity towards the oxidation of polyphenol mixtures than the untreated SPCE. Finally, good linear ranges were obtained by voltammetric determination of dopamine with detection and quantification limits 5 times lower than the values obtained for the untreated SPCE. The versatility of oxidation by air makes this activation procedure very attractive and easy to implement, which can be further used for numerous applications in the (bio)sensor field.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3acarbon 3acarbon electrodes 3acatalytic activity 3acatechol 3adopamine 3aelectrochemistry 3aheat treatment 3ahydroquinone 3aoxidation 3aoxygen 3apolyphenols 3apyrogallol 3aquinones 3atemperature1 aLópez-Puente, Vanesa1 aPastoriza-Santos, Isabel1 aPérez-Juste, Jorge1 aProença, Maria Fernanda1 aBento, Fátima1 aGeraldo, Dulce1 aPaiva, Maria Conceição1 aGonzález-Romero, Elisa0 tRSC advances.g2014 Dec. 17, v. 5, no. 7 p.5024-5031dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c4ra12660b3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02896naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001400151245010800165300001600273500001400289520131900303592002801622650002001650650002001670650001201690650001901702650001201721650001601733650001301749650001501762650001001777650001301787650001101800650001701811650002801828650001601856651000901872653001901881653002801900653002001928653002301948653002801971700002701999700002102026700002802047700002102075700001702096773015902113856008502272852000902357655001202366IND60723571920221116153220.0210114e20210217xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072357192DNAL7 a10.1080/13504509.2020.17934242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAmiri, M.12aA new fuzzy BWM approach for evaluating and selecting a sustainable supplier in supply chain management  ap. 125-142.  aNAL-light  aSustainability has become one of the most important issues in the field of supply chain management (SCM). In recent years, many studies have been conducted about how to select a sustainable supplier and different methods have been proposed for this purpose in fuzzy and deterministic environments. A review of the research literature reveals that decision-makers have paid more attention to the results of fuzzy-based studies because they are more accurate and precise in collecting data. The purpose of this paper is to present a new model with a triangular fuzzy approach for sustainable supplier selection (SSS) in the supply chain. The proposed fuzzy model is based on the best-worst method (BWM) and α-cut analysis in which the decision-maker (DM) can determine the alpha value between 0.1 and 0.9, depending on the level of uncertainty. A high value of alpha indicates low uncertainty and its low value indicates a high uncertainty in decision-making. To illustrate the model and demonstrate its capability, a real SSS case in Iran Khodro Company (IKCO), was examined by three experts in the automotive industry and the decision criteria were selected based on the literature review and expert opinions. The results show that the first supplier (ISACO Parts Supply Company) is the most sustainable supplier.  aPublisher supplied data 3adata collection 3adecision making 3aecology 3aexpert opinion 3aexperts 3afuzzy logic 3aindustry 3aliterature 3apaper 3aresearch 3asupply 3asupply chain 3asustainable development 3auncertainty 3aIran 0aSustainability 0afuzzy best-worst method 0aα-cut analysis 0asupplier selection 0asupply chain management1 aHashemi-Tabatabaei, M.1 aGhahremanloo, M.1 aKeshavarz-Ghorabaee, M.1 aZavadskas, E.

Birds are considered to be the primary selective agents for warning colouration in butterflies, and select for aposematic mimicry by learning to avoid brightly coloured prey after unpleasant experiences. It has long been thought that bright colouration plays an important role in promoting the avoidance of distasteful prey by birds. 2. The hypothesis that warning colouration facilitates memorability and promotes predator avoidance was tested by means of a field experiment using distasteful model butterflies. Artificial butterflies with a Heliconius colour pattern unknown to local birds were generated using bird vision models, either coloured or achromatic, and hung in tree branches in a tropical forest. Two sequential trials were conducted at each site to test avoidance by naïve and experienced predators. 3. There was a significant reduction in predation in the second trial. Also, coloured models were attacked less than achromatic models. Specifically, coloured butterflies were attacked significantly less in the second trial, but there was no significant decrease in predation on achromatic models. 4. The present results imply an important role for colour in enhancing aversion of aposematic butterflies. It has also been demonstrated that previous experience of distasteful prey can lead to enhanced avoidance in subsequent trials, supporting mimicry theory.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aHeliconius 3abirds of prey 3abranches 3abutterflies 3acolor 3afield experimentation 3alearning 3amodels 3apredation 3atrees 3atropical forests 3avision 3awild birds1 aStevens, Martin,1 aJiggins, Chris D.,0 tEcological entomology.g2016 Oct., v. 41, no. 5 p.627-632dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0307-69467nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/een.123353Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02800naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001400152245013800166300001600304520132000320592002801640650002601668650001201694650002301706650003601729650002001765650001501785650001001800650002101810650001401831650001101845650002301856650001201879650002201891653003401913653002001947653001901967653002501986700001102011700001202022700001702034700001802051700001802069773013502087856008702222852000902309655001202318IND60786142220221122182218.0220929e20221031xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078614222DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2022.07.2132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNi, Zi-Fu10aEnhancement of thermostability and catalytic properties of ammonia lyase through disulfide bond construction and backbone cyclization  ap. 804-811.  aAmmonia lyases have great application potential in food and pharmaceuticals owing to their unique ammonia addition reaction and atom economy. A novel methylaspartate ammonia-lyase, EcMAL, from E. coli O157:H7 showed high catalytic activity. To further strengthen its thermostability and activity, disulfide bond and backbone cyclization (cyclase) variants were constructed by rational design, respectively. Among them, variant M3, with a disulfide bond introduced, exhibited a 2.3-fold increase in half-life at 50 °C, while cyclase variant M8 showed better performance, with 25.9-fold increases. The synergistic promotion effect of this combinational strategy on activity and stability was also investigated, and the combined mutant M9 exhibited a 1.1-fold improvement in catalytic efficiency while maintaining good thermostability. Circular dichroism analysis and molecular dynamics simulation confirmed that the main sources of improved thermostability were reduced atomic fluctuation and a more stable secondary structure. To our knowledge, this is the first example of combining the introduction of disulfide bonds with cyclase construction to improve enzyme stability, which was characterized by modification away from the enzyme active center, and provided a new method for adjusting enzyme thermostability.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli O157 3aammonia 3acatalytic activity 3acircular dichroism spectroscopy 3adisulfide bonds 3adisulfides 3adrugs 3aenzyme stability 3ahalf life 3alyases 3amolecular dynamics 3amutants 3athermal stability 0aMethylaspartate ammonia-lyase 0aThermostability 0aDisulfide bond 0aBackbone cyclization1 aLi, Na1 aXu, Pei1 aGuo, Ze-Wang1 aZong, Min-Hua1 aLou, Wen-Yong0 tInternational journal of biological macromolecules.g2022 Oct. 31, v. 219 p.804-811dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12340x0141-81307nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2022.07.2133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03154naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245012300159300001800282520143200300592002801732650003301760650001001793650002101803650001801824650002501842650001601867650001301883650000901896650001601905650002001921650001601941650004101957650001701998650002002015650001402035650001402049650001002063650001002073650002002083650001202103650004302115650002502158650002102183700001902204700001902223700001702242700001302259700001502272700001202287700001302299700001602312700001602328773012502344856007402469852000902543655001202552IND60747060420221118072011.0210811e20210802xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074706042DNAL7 a10.1039/d0fo03094e2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGuo, Zhongyang10aDietary dihydromyricetin supplementation enhances antioxidant capacity and improves lipid metabolism in finishing pigs  ap. 6925-6935.  aNowadays, chronic diseases have become a potential danger to human health and are highly concerning. Given that pigs are a suitable animal model for human nutrition and metabolism for its similar anatomical and physiological properties to those of humans, this study has used 24 castrated male Duroc × Landrace × Yorkshire (DLY) pigs as experimental subjects to explore the effects of dietary dihydromyricetin (DHM) supplementation on the antioxidant capacity and lipid metabolism. Results showed that dietary 300 and 500 mg DHM kg⁻¹ diet supplementation increased the serum total superoxide dismutase (T-SOD) level, serum and liver reduced glutathione (GSH), muscle catalase (CAT) level and serum high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) level, and reduced the liver malondialdehyde (MDA) level and muscle triglyceride (TG) level in finishing pigs. Western blot analysis showed that dietary DHM supplementation activated the nuclear-related factor 2 (Nrf2) and AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK)/acetyl–CoA carboxylase (ACC) signals. Real-time quantitative PCR analysis showed that dietary DHM supplementation upregulated the mRNA levels of lipolysis and fatty acid oxidation-related genes, and down-regulated the mRNA expression of lipogenesis-related genes in finishing pigs. Together, we provide evidence that dietary DHM supplementation improved the antioxidant capacity and lipid metabolism in finishing pigs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAMP-activated protein kinase 3aDuroc 3aWestern blotting 3aanimal models 3aantioxidant activity 3ablood serum 3acatalase 3adiet 3afatty acids 3agene expression 3aglutathione 3ahigh density lipoprotein cholesterol 3ahuman health 3ahuman nutrition 3alandraces 3alipolysis 3aliver 3amales 3amalondialdehyde 3amuscles 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3asuperoxide dismutase 3atriacylglycerols1 aChen, Xiaoling1 aHuang, Zhiqing1 aChen, Daiwen1 aYu, Bing1 aChen, Hong1 aYu, Jie1 aYan, Hui1 aZheng, Ping1 aLuo, Yuheng0 tFood & function.g2021 Aug. 2, v. 12, no. 15 p.6925-6935dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26907x2042-650X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d0fo03094e3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03696naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094024002200132024001900154040001800173100003500191245009900226300001600325506007600341520180400417592002802221506003702249650001602286650003102302650004802333650001302381650001302394650001802407650002802425650002002453650002202473650001602495650000902511650003702520650000702557650002102564650001302585653001302598653001502611653001702626653001102643653002902654700001902683700002102702700006902723700002102792700002502813700002402838700006002862773009002922856008503012852000903097655001203106IND60661584920221207144018.0190923e201910  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066158492DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biochi.2019.08.0132doi7 aPMC67466022pmcid7 a314700392pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlli-Oluwafuyi, Abdul-Musawwir10aCurcumin induces secretion of glucagon-like peptide-1 through an oxidation-dependent mechanism  ap. 250-257.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aCurcumin shows antiglycemic effects in animals. Curcumin is chemically unstable at physiological pH, and its oxidative degradation products were shown to contribute to its anti-inflammatory effects. Since the degradation products may also contribute to other effects, we analyzed their role in the antiglycemic activity of curcumin. We quantified curcumin-induced release of glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) from mouse STC-1 cells that represent enteroendocrine L-cells as a major source of this anti-diabetic hormone. Curcumin induced secretion of GLP-1 in a dose-dependent manner. Two chemically stable analogues of curcumin that do not readily undergo degradation, were less active while two unstable analogues were active secretagogues. Chromatographically isolated spiroepoxide, an unstable oxidative metabolite of curcumin with anti-inflammatory activity, also induced secretion of GLP-1. Stable compounds like the final oxidative metabolite bicyclopentadione, and the major plasma metabolite, curcumin-glucuronide, were inactive. GLP-1 secretion induced by curcumin and its oxidative degradation products was associated with activation of PKC, ERK, and CaM kinase II. Since activity largely correlated with instability of curcumin and the analogues, we tested the extent of covalent binding to proteins in STC-1 cells and found it occurred with similar affinity as N-ethylmaleimide, indicating covalent binding occurred with nucleophilic cysteine residues. These results suggest that oxidative metabolites of curcumin are involved in the antiglycemic effects of curcumin. Our findings support the hypothesis that curcumin functions as a pro-drug requiring oxidative activation to reveal its bioactive metabolites that act by binding to target proteins thereby causing a change in function.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aLewis bases 3aanti-inflammatory activity 3acalcium-calmodulin-dependent protein kinase 3acurcumin 3acysteine 3adose response 3aglucagon-like peptide 1 3aglycemic effect 3ahormone secretion 3ametabolites 3amice 3amitogen-activated protein kinase 3apH 3aprotein kinase C 3aproteins 0aTurmeric 0aPolyphenol 0aAntiglycemic 0aL cell 0aOxidative transformation1 aLuis, Paula B.1 aNakashima, Fumie1 aGiménez-Bastida, Juan A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1244-87641 aPresley, Sai Han1 aDuvernay, Matthew T.1 aIwalewa, Ezekiel O.1 aSchneider, Claus1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4215-967X0 tBiochimie.g2019 Oct., v. 165 p.250-257dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6254x0300-90847nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biochi.2019.08.0133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03109naa a2200853 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245016100164300001600325520091500341592002801256650001201284650002001296650002301316650002001339650001601359650001901375650000901394650002301403650001301426650001201439650000901451650001301460650001401473650002201487650001301509650001501522650003201537650001801569653001901587653002401606653003001630653002301660653004201683653001301725653000801738653000901746653000701755653000701762653000901769653000801778653000801786653000701794653000801801653000801809653000801817653000801825653000801833653000801841653000801849653000801857653000801865653001101873653000901884653000901893653001101902653000801913653000801921653001001929700001701939700001401956700001901970700001701989700001902006700001602025773011102041856008202152852000902234655001202243IND60525788220221117201507.0190401e201606  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052578822DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fct.2016.03.0202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhao, Lihong10aProtective effect of Devosia sp.

METHODS: Boiled unripe plantain (BUP), boiled unripe plantain crisps (BUPC), ripe raw plantain (RRP) and white bread as reference (all 25 g available carbohydrate portion) were given to ten pre-screened healthy individuals. Postprandial glycaemic responses and glycaemic indices (GI) were measured. RESULTS: Peak blood glucose for BUP, BUPC and RRP was at 45, 45 and 30 min post-meal time, respectively. The peak blood glucose concentrations for BUP, BUPC and RRP (1.8 ± 0.8, 2.3 ± 0.8, 1.9 ± 0.7 mmol/L, n = 10, respectively) reflected the in vitro quantities/types of rapidly available glucose (RAG) in the samples. On the other hand, mean GI ± SEM values obtained for the test products (BUP = 44.9 ± 3.6, BUPC = 55.0 ± 4.2, RRP = 38 ± 4.4, n = 10) were neither significantly different nor directly correlated with RAG. CONCLUSIONS: The results show a potential link between RAG and GI, but the correlation is confounded by the presence of other constituents in the plantains.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMusa 3ablood glucose 3aglucose 3aglycemic effect 3aglycemic index 3aresistant starch 3ascanning electron microscopy 3avolunteers 3awhite bread1 aWilliamson, Gary0 tEuropean journal of nutrition.g2016 Feb., v. 55, no. 1 p.75-81dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl3949855x1436-62077nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00394-014-0825-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02616naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100003600149245010400185500001400289520116400303592002801467650001601495650002101511650002801532650001001560650001401570650001401584650001001598650001801608650001301626650001501639650003001654650001401684650001501698700002501713700002601738700004201764700003901806700003301845700003001878700002401908773013401932856008302066852000902149655001202158IND60721525820221119112303.0201224e20201216xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072152582DNAL7 a10.3390/agriculture101206382doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRosado, Renato  Domiciano Silva10aArtificial Neural Networks in the Prediction of Genetic Merit to Flowering Traits in Bean Cultivars  aNAL-light  aFlowering is an important agronomic trait that presents non-additive gene action. Genome-enabled prediction allow incorporating molecular information into the prediction of individual genetic merit. Artificial neural networks (ANN) recognize patterns of data and represent an alternative as a universal approximation of complex functions. In a Genomic Selection (GS) context, the ANN allows automatically to capture complicated factors such as epistasis and dominance. The objectives of this study were to predict the individual genetic merits of the traits associated with the flowering time in the common bean using the ANN approach, and to compare the predictive abilities obtained for ANN and Ridge Regression Best Linear Unbiased Predictor (RR-BLUP). We used a set of 80 bean cultivars and genotyping was performed with a set of 384 SNPs. The higher accuracy of the selective process of phenotypic values based on ANN output values resulted in a greater efficacy of the genomic estimated breeding value (GEBV). Through the root mean square error computational intelligence approaches via ANN, GEBV were shown to have greater efficacy than GS via RR-BLUP.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagriculture 3aagronomic traits 3aartificial intelligence 3abeans 3acultivars 3aepistasis 3agenes 3agenetic merit 3agenomics 3agenotyping 3amarker-assisted selection 3aphenotype 3aprediction1 aCruz, Cosme  Damião1 aBarili, Leiri  Daiane1 ade Souza Carneiro, José  Eustáquio 1 aCarneiro, Pedro  Crescêncio Souza1 aCarneiro, Vinicius  Quintão1 ada Silva, Jackson  Tavela1 aNascimento, Moyses 0 tAgriculture (Basel).g2020 Dec. 16, v. 10, no. 12dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:12387x2077-04727nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agriculture101206383Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02410naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002300152245012900175300001600304520105300320592002801373650002101401650001901422650001401441650001301455650001701468650001901485650001201504650001601516650001501532653002501547653001501572653001801587653002901605653001801634653001901652700002901671700002001700700002501720773013501745856008701880852000901967655001201976IND60786142320221122182246.0220929e20221031xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078614232DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2022.07.2142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRazaghpour, Mojgan10aAmino-functionalized cross-linked cellulosic fabric with antibacterial, UV protection, and coloring effects using folic acid  ap. 637-649.  aThe amino-functionalized cellulose with folic acid, via an esterification reaction between carboxylic acid of folic acid and hydroxyl groups of cellulose, can develop multifunctional products with new chemical and physical properties. Folic acid contains two carboxylic groups as well as an amine group that can be used as a coupling agent and provide suitable conditions for coupling hydroxyl-based compounds to cellulose. Also; the multi-functionalized cellulose with folic acid has no effects on the physical and mechanical properties and also has benefits such as antibacterial, UV protection, and wrinkle resistance. The FTIR-ATR and Raman analysis confirmed the amino functionalized-cellulosic fabric via an esterification reaction between cellulose and folic acid. The cell viability of L929 fibroblast (NCBI C161) and MCF-7 (NCBI C135) cancer cells indicated more effectiveness on MCF-7 cancer cells. Therefore; folic acid can be used as a biocompatible natural cross-linker to modify cellulose fabrics for apparel and medical applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarboxylic acids 3acell viability 3acellulose 3aclothing 3acrosslinking 3aesterification 3afabrics 3afibroblasts 3afolic acid 0aAmino-functionalized 0aFolic acid 0aCross-linking 0aAntimicrobial properties 0aUV protection 0aCell viability1 aMalek, Reza Mohammad Ali1 aMontazer, Majid1 aMallakpour, Shadpour0 tInternational journal of biological macromolecules.g2022 Oct. 31, v. 219 p.637-649dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12340x0141-81307nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2022.07.2143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03146naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100002100137245010600158300001800264500001900282500002000301520186200321592002802183650002302211650001402234650002502248650001802273650002102291650001402312650001602326650002302342650001402365650001202379650001002391651001002401700001702411700002002428700007002448773012602518856007102644852000902715655001202724IND60738373520221119221924.0210524e202106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073837352DNAL7 a10.1002/ps.63042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMaity, Aniruddha10aSeed traits correlate with herbicide resistance in Italian ryegrass (Lolium perenne ssp. multiflorum)  ap. 2756-2765.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aBACKGROUND: Italian ryegrass (Lolium perenne ssp. multiflorum) is one of the major winter annual weeds worldwide. In this research, diversity for seed morpho‐physiological traits such as seed weight, seed size, awnedness, dormancy, speed of germination, and seed vigor among Italian ryegrass populations collected from the Texas Blacklands region were assessed, and potential association with herbicide resistance was investigated. RESULTS: A high degree of diversity was observed among the populations for 100‐seed weight (125–256 mg), seed length (4.8–6.6 mm), awn length (0–6 mm), and total seedling length (9–14 cm at 21 days after seed germination). Inter‐population range for seed dormancy was higher in the freshly harvested seed (31–85%), which reduced to 18 to 62% at 9 months after harvest. Populations with high initial seed dormancy (> 70% dormancy) released dormancy at a faster rate than the low dormancy group (< 40%). Percent survival status to multiple postemergence herbicides was positively correlated with 100‐seed weight and fresh or initial seed dormancy. CONCLUSION: Early emerging cohorts are easily controlled by pre‐plant tillage and preemergence herbicides, whereas late emerging cohorts (facilitated by seed dormancy) are exposed to postemergence herbicides wherein greater opportunities exist for resistance evolution, likely explaining the occurrence of high seed dormancy in Italian ryegrass populations resistant to postemergence herbicides. High seed weights can further allow seedling emergence from greater burial depth, thereby exposing more seedlings to postemergence herbicides and increasing the likelihood of resistance evolution. Results provide unique insights into the association between seed traits and herbicide resistance in this species. © 2021 Society of Chemical Industry  aPublisher supplied data 3aLolium multiflorum 3aevolution 3aherbicide resistance 3aseed dormancy 3aseed germination 3aseed size 3aseed weight 3aseedling emergence 3aseedlings 3atillage 3avigor 3aTexas1 aSingh, Vijay1 aJessup, Russell1 aBagavathiannan, Muthukumar1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1107-71480 tPest management science.g2021 June, v. 77, no. 6 p.2756-2765dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.wJournal:jnl59519x1526-498X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ps.63043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01549naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100002100112245007600133300001600209520063300225592002800858650002500886650001200911650001000923650001900933650001300952650001400965650001800979650001500997653002301012653004001035700001401075773012501089852000901214655001201223IND60738448120221120154714.0210524e202102  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073844812DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMeriem, Bensmira10aApplication of Sunflower Seed Oil in Preparation of Novel Low-Fat Kefir  ap. 267-270.  aThe objectives of this research were focused on preparing Kefir with skimmed milk and sunflower seed oil and studying its compositional, rheological, and textural properties as well as its microstructure characteristics.

To identify the possible sources and interpret the atmospheric deposition processes of phosphorus, we measured the phosphate oxygen isotopes (δ¹⁸OP) in the precipitation monthly from October 2015 to March 2017 in Daya Bay, South China Sea. The isotopic results show that the δ¹⁸OP values in the dry season (+19.60‰ to +25.80‰, +23.10‰ average) were significantly higher than those in the wet season (+12.52‰ to +20.11‰, +16.73‰ average), indicating a variable contribution from different phosphorus sources to the precipitation between seasons. The δ¹⁸OP value was primarily influenced by the phosphorus concentrations, rainfall, and air temperature. The exchange of phosphate molecules among phosphorus pools caused isotope dilution (wet season) or enrichment effects (dry season) during the seasonal shifts. The δ¹⁸OP value of the precipitation and the local end-members indicate that coal combustion (39% ± 16%), biomass burning (22% ± 18%), and soil (17% ± 13%) sources dominate in the dry season, whereas marine sources (28% ± 19%) and coal combustion (24% ± 12%) account for the highest proportion in the wet season using a MixSIAR model. The atmospheric wet deposition flux of phosphorus in Daya Bay was 379.0 μmol m⁻²·yr⁻¹. The wet deposition of phosphorus exhibits a significant seasonal trend with higher deposition fluxes in the wet season than in the dry season as a result of higher rainfall and source shifts (local sources to marine source) between seasons.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair temperature 3abioavailability 3abiomass 3acoal 3acombustion 3adry season 3aenvironment 3ahumans 3aisotope dilution technique 3amodels 3amonsoon season 3aoxygen 3aoxygen isotopes 3aphosphates 3aphosphorus 3arain 3asoil 3awet deposition 3awet season 3aSouth China Sea 0aδ18OP 0aSources 0aPrecipitation 0aDeposition flux1 aHuang, Xiaoping1 aJiang, Zhijian1 aLiu, Songlin0 tAtmospheric environment.g2021 Jan. 01, v. 244 p.118008-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12031x1352-23107nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.atmosenv.2020.1180083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02748naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100005700150245012000207300001600327520122100343592002801564650002201592650003701614650001501651650002801666650002401694650002801718650001501746650001501761650001101776650002201787650003301809650001601842650002101858700007001879700002201949700007401971700006402045700002502109773008602134856008502220852000902305655001202314IND60630111920221120073502.0190502e201905  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063011192DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbon.2019.01.1052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSidhik, Siraj1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2097-283010aRole of carbon nanodots in defect passivation and photo-sensitization of mesoscopic-TiO2 for perovskite solar cells  ap. 388-398.  aIn this work, a recently developed carbon nanodots (CnDs) were introduced in the mesoscopic TiO2 to form a TiO2: CnDs composite, to be used as an electrode in CH3NH3PbI3 based perovskite devices.

In addition, the presence of carbon dots enhanced the charge carrier mobility of TiO2 and provided extra photo-generation ability to the perovskite device due to its absorbing nature. The improved morphology, carbon-doping, photogeneration ability and the improved charge transfer characteristics with the introduction of carbon dots was verified by the scanning electron microscopy (SEM), atomic force microscopy (AFM), X-Ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), UV-visible absorption, X-ray diffraction, space charge limited current (SCLC) measurement, photoluminescence (PL), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), current leakage and open circuit photovoltage decay (OCPD) measurements. An optimized concentration of CnDs (3 wt%) within the TiO2 resulted in a maximum power conversion efficiency of 19.45% with negligible hysteresis, which is 16% higher than the device with pristine TiO2.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3aabsorption 3aatomic force microscopy 3acarbon quantum dots 3adielectric spectroscopy 3aelectrodes 3ahysteresis 3aoxygen 3aphotoluminescence 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asolar cells 3atitanium dioxide1 aVelusamy, Jayaramakrishnan1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4854-814X1 aDe la Rosa, Elder1 aPérez-García, Sergio Alfonso1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6947-47281 aRamos-Ortiz, Gabriel1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9025-735X1 aLópez-Luke, Tzarara0 tCarbon.g2019 May, v. 146 p.388-398dElsevier LtdwJournal:11670x0008-62237nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbon.2019.01.1053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02742naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245010200164300001800266520178700284592002802071650002302099650002602122650001902148650001502167650001902182651001802201700001802219700001302237773012102250856004802371852000902419655001202428IND50087937820221119212247.0140412e20110620xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5008793782DNAL7 a10.1080/014311610037456572doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPu, Ruiliang10aObject-based urban detailed land cover classification with high spatial resolution IKONOS imagery  ap. 3285-3308.  aImprovement in remote sensing techniques in spatial/spectral resolution strengthens their applicability for urban environmental study. Unfortunately, high spatial resolution imagery also increases internal variability in land cover units and can cause a ‘salt-and-pepper’ effect, resulting in decreased accuracy using pixel-based classification results. Region-based classification techniques, using an image object (IO) rather than a pixel as a classification unit, appear to hold promise as a method for overcoming this problem. Using IKONOS high spatial resolution imagery, we examined whether the IO technique could significantly improve classification accuracy compared to the pixel-based method when applied to urban land cover mapping in Tampa Bay, FL, USA. We further compared the performance of an artificial neural network (ANN) and a minimum distance classifier (MDC) in urban detailed land cover classification and evaluated whether the classification accuracy was affected by the number of extracted IO features. Our analysis methods included IKONOS image data calibration, data fusion with the pansharpening (PS) process, Hue–Intensity–Saturation (HIS) transferred indices and textural feature extraction, and feature selection using a stepwise discriminant analysis (SDA). The classification results were evaluated with visually interpreted data from high-resolution (0.3 m) digital aerial photographs. Our results indicate a statistically significant difference in classification accuracy between pixel- and object-based techniques; ANN outperforms MDC as an object-based classifier; and the use of more features (27 vs. 9 features) increases the IO classification accuracy, although the increase is statistically significant for the MDC but not for the ANN.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaerial photography 3adiscriminant analysis 3aimage analysis 3aland cover 3aremote sensing 3aUnited States1 aLandry, Shawn1 aYu, Qian0 tInternational journal of remote sensing.g2011 June 20, v. 32, no. 12 p.3285-3308dTaylor & Francisx1366-59017nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01431161003745657  aDNAL 7aarticle02949naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245007000168500001900238520164100257592002801898650001101926650002401937650001601961650002401977650002402001650001002025650001902035650002002054650001602074650002302090653001602113653002102129653001102150653001802161700001802179700001702197700001702214700001502231700001802246700001702264700001402281773009002295856008502385852000902470655001202479IND60707536520221118220707.0201024e20201101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070753652DNAL7 a10.1016/j.energy.2020.1186012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCheng, Xudong10aSolar chimney in tunnel considering energy-saving and fire safety  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aAlthough solar chimney as a reliable passive renewable energy system has been widely adopted in buildings, its application in the tunnel is so far limited. By developing a validated numerical model, this study systematically investigated four critical factors that govern the effectiveness of solar chimney in tunnel applications, such as cavity height (hc), cavity gap (L), solar radiation, and fire size. It was known that the chimney height in tunnel shows a relatively higher impact on the natural ventilation when comparing to the applications in building, but in an opposite position for the solar radiation. The natural ventilation rate is proportional to hc⁰.⁶⁹ in the tunnel, but the power is between 0.5 and 2/3 for building applications. The power for solar radiation in tunnel is 0.34, where it is 0.572 for building. It was obtained from an orthogonal analysis that chimney height presents a relatively higher impact on the natural ventilation performance of a solar chimney in the tunnel, but it shows an opposite phenomenon under the smoke exhaustion model. Under both natural ventilation and smoke exhaustion modes, chimney height and cavity gap show relatively stronger influence on the performance than that from the solar radiation. A theoretical model was also developed that considers both the vertically linear and horizontally parabolic temperature distributions inside the chimney cavity. The predictions when considering both distributions agree reasonably well with those numerical results, which drops about 20.6% when comparing to the predictions of those traditional models without the considerations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aenergy 3aenergy conservation 3afire safety 3amathematical models 3anatural ventilation 3asmoke 3asolar chimneys 3asolar radiation 3atemperature 3atheoretical models 0aTrombe wall 0aRenewable energy 0aTunnel 0aCFD modelling1 aShi, Zhicheng1 aNguyen, Kate1 aZhang, Lihai1 aZhou, Yong1 aZhang, Guomin1 aWang, Jinhui1 aShi, Long0 tEnergy.g2020 Nov. 01, v. 210 p.118601-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12436x0360-54427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2020.1186013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01534naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001600140245016100156300001800317520032700335592002800662650002400690650002000714650002300734650002300757650002000780650001800800650001500818650001100833650001900844700001500863700001500878700001600893700001400909700002100923773012100944856007401065852000901139655001201148IND60667050620221121092639.0190919e20141211xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066705062DNAL7 a10.1039/c4ra12665c2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLuo, Suibin10aInvestigating the mechanism of catalytic reduction of silver nitrate on the surface of barium titanate at room temperature: oxygen vacancies play a key role  ap. 3377-3380.  aIn this study, the formation mechanism of Ag nanoparticles deposited on Barium Titanate (BT) surface was investigated.

However, data involving gastrointestinal (GI) have been limited, and the evidence remains controversial. This study aims to determine the potential relationship between dietary soy intake and GI cancer risk with an evaluation of the effects of isoflavone as an active soy constituent. METHODS: Relevant studies were identified after literature search via electronic databases through May 2014. Subgroup analysis for isoflavone intake (studies n = 10) was performed. Covariants including gender types, anatomical subsites and preparation methods were also evaluated. Pooled adjusted odds ratios (ORs) comparing highest and lowest categories of dietary pattern scores were calculated using a random effects model. RESULTS: Twenty-two case–control and 18 cohort studies were included for meta-analysis, which contained a total of 633,476 participants and 13,639 GI cancer cases. The combined OR was calculated as 0.93 (95 % CI 0.87–0.99; p value heterogeneity = 0.01), showing only a slight decrease in risk, the association was stronger for colon cancer (OR 0.92; 95 % CI 0.96–0.99; p value heterogeneity = 0.163) and colorectal cancer (CRC) (OR 0.92; 95 % CI 0.87–0.97; p value heterogeneity = 0.3). Subgroup analysis for isoflavone intake showed a statistically significant risk reduction with a risk estimate of 0.73 (95 % CI 0.59–0.92; p value heterogeneity = 0), and particularly for CRC (OR 0.76; 95 % CI 0.59–0.98; p value heterogeneity = 0). CONCLUSION: This study provides evidence that soy intake as a food group is only associated with a small reduction in GI cancer risk. Separate analysis for dietary isoflavone intakes suggests a stronger inverse association.  aPublisher supplied data 3abreast neoplasms 3acohort studies 3acolorectal neoplasms 3adatabases 3aeating habits 3afood groups 3afood intake 3agastrointestinal system 3agender 3aisoflavones 3ameta-analysis 3amodels 3aodds ratio 3aprostatic neoplasms 3arisk 3arisk estimate 3arisk reduction 3asystematic review1 aEslick, Guy D.0 tEuropean journal of nutrition.g2016 Feb., v. 55, no. 1 p.63-73dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl3949855x1436-62077nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00394-014-0824-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01619naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245012700159300002000286520061700306592002800923650002600951650002300977650001701000650001001017650002101027650001401048650002101062700001501083773012401098856007401222852000901296655001201305IND60667050720221121092628.0190919e20150325xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066705072DNAL7 a10.1039/c4ra12670j2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKanakaraju, S.10aDesign, synthesis, in vitro antimicrobial and cytotoxic evaluation of novel 1,2,3-selena/thiadiazolyltetrazole derivatives  ap. 29325-29334.  aA new series of 2,5-disubstituted tetrazoles and 1,2,3-selena/thiadiazolyl-2H-tetrazole derivatives were synthesized and evaluated for their in vitro antimicrobial and cytotoxic activities against pathogenic strains.

This stress can cause damage on DNA and, consequently, contribute to the high levels of DNA damage observed in these patients. Due to the well-known role of polyphenols as antioxidant agents we proposed its use to reduce the levels of genotoxicity present in HD-CKD patients. The objective of this study was to evaluate the antigenotoxic effects of unfermented grape juice (UGJ) on HD-CKD patients. The levels of DNA damage were analyzed using different biomarkers, such as breaks and oxidized DNA bases by the comet assay, chromosome damage by the micronucleus test. In addition, TEAC (Trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity) was also evaluated. Thirty-nine patients were followed for six months, of whom 25 were supplemented by UGJ and 14 were not supplemented. The obtained results showed a significant decrease in the underlying levels of oxidative DNA damage, in the supplemented group. Regarding the clinical parameters, LDL and cholesterol, were significantly reduced in the patients studied after the supplementation period, although cholesterol was also decreased in the non-supplemented patients. In conclusion, in our studied group the supplementation with UGJ reduced the levels of oxidative DNA damage of HD-CKD patients.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aDNA damage 3aantioxidant activity 3aantioxidants 3abiomarkers 3achromosomes 3adialysis 3agenotoxicity 3agrape juice 3ahemodialysis 3akidney diseases 3alow density lipoprotein cholesterol 3aoxidative stress 3apatients 3apolyphenols 3atoxicology 0aHemodialysis 0aUnfermented grape juice (UGJ) 0aComet assay 0aMicronucleus assay 0aTrolox equivalent antioxidant capacity (TEAC) assay 0aOxidative damage1 aRodríguez-Ribera, Lara1 aColl, Elisabeth1 aMontañés, Rosario1 aDíaz, Juan Manuel,1 aBallarin, José1 aMarcos, Ricard1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7891-357X1 aPastor, Susana0 tFood and chemical toxicology.g2016 June, v. 92 p.1-7dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl33424x0278-69157nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fct.2016.03.0163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02756naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002800149245011400177500001400291520150900305592002801814650001301842650001601855650003001871650001101901650002001912650002001932650001001952650001501962650001701977650001101994650001502005650001002020650001502030650002102045700003402066700002002100773013402120856008302254852000902337655001202346IND60721526120221119112414.0201224e20201217xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072152612DNAL7 a10.3390/agriculture101206412doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMadasamy, Bhuvaneswari 10aMicroclimate-Based Pest and Disease Management through a Forewarning System for Sustainable Cotton Production  aNAL-light  aCotton is an essential commercial crop. Unfortunately, this crop is affected by many pests and diseases, which can cause considerable loss in yield. Climate has a strong correlation with the occurrence of pests and diseases in crops. Currently, weather forecasting services are available to the farmers, which help with weather-based planning of farm operations. Still, weather-based pest and disease forewarning services are not available to all the farmers. Unfortunately, cotton cultivation consumes about one-third of total pesticide consumption, which increases the cost of production apart from polluting the environment. An information and communication technology (ICT) based intelligent pest and disease forewarning system for cotton is an innovative system for providing forewarning on pests and diseases. It aims at improving farm productivity through better crop management. In this paper, the proposed method aims to predict the occurrence of pests and diseases based on microclimatic parameters. This pest and disease forewarning information and appropriate crop management practices will be disseminated to the farmers using electronic media through short message service (SMS), the Internet, etc. In this way, both livelihood security and environmental security are achieved. The proposed model shows a higher optimal performance then the two related works in terms of the average root mean square error rate, average accuracy rate, average percentage error rate, and prediction accuracy.  aPublisher supplied data 3aInternet 3aagriculture 3acommunications technology 3acotton 3acrop management 3adisease control 3afarms 3alivelihood 3amicroclimate 3amodels 3apesticides 3apests 3aprediction 3aproduction costs1 aBalasubramaniam, Paramasivan 1 aDutta, Ritaban 0 tAgriculture (Basel).g2020 Dec. 17, v. 10, no. 12dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:12387x2077-04727nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agriculture101206413Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02577naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002300139245008500162300001600247500002000263500001500283520145600298592002801754650001501782650002501797650001201822650001301834650002601847650001701873650001601890650002401906650001501930653001801945700002101963700002001984773010502004856007302109852000902182655001202191IND60549755020221116143359.0160908e201610  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054975502DNAL7 a10.1111/een.123342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWELTI, ELLEN A.

Crab spiders (Thomisidae) indirectly affect insect flower‐visitor and flowering plant interactions by consuming and altering the behaviour of insects. 2. Although one expects insect flower‐visitors to avoid crab spiders actively, some crab spider species are known to attract flower‐visitors. Crab spiders may use UV signalling to lure potential prey to the flowers they occupy. 3. In the present study, a field experiment was conducted to examine the effects of crab spiders occupying three prairie plant species for the insect flower‐visitor community. Pollinating insects were significantly attracted to inflorescences with crab spiders compared to inflorescences without crab spiders for two plant species, and herbivorous insects were attracted to inflorescences with crab spiders for one of these plant species. The two flowering plant species with increased pollinator visitation showed increased seed weights for plants with crab spiders, indicating crab spider presence indirectly increased pollination. 4. To test the UV signalling hypothesis, inflorescences with crab spiders of one plant species were observed under both a UV‐blocking plastic and a clear plastic control. Contrary to our prediction, flower‐visitors were not more likely to land on inflorescences under the clear plastic; the UV signalling hypothesis was not supported. Other unknown explanations underlie prey attraction to inflorescences with crab spiders.  aPublisher supplied data 3aThomisidae 3aphytophagous insects 3aflowers 3aplastics 3afield experimentation 3aAngiospermae 3apollination 3apollinating insects 3aprediction 0aMagnoliophyta1 aPUTNAM, SAVANNAH1 aJoern, Anthony,0 tEcological entomology.g2016 Oct., v. 41, no. 5 p.611-617dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0307-69467nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/een.123343Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02514naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245010200167520138600269592002801655650001301683650001101696650001401707650002601721650001301747650001601760653002401776653001901800653001301819653002701832700005201859700001501911700001301926700001701939773009001956856008502046852000902131655001202140IND60756510820221119030541.0220328e20220401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075651082DNAL7 a10.1016/j.energy.2021.1225802doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNguyen, T.D.10aExperimental investigation on cooling of prismatic battery cells through cell integrated features  aLithium-ion batteries are sensitive to temperature changes over their life. High operational temperatures can negatively affect the battery and lead to capacity fade and lifespan reduction. Air-cooled thermal management systems are widely used in electrified vehicles. A novel air-cooled battery design is introduced. Aluminum fin cooling features are directly integrated onto prismatic cells rather than established by the use of an auxiliary polymer component. When the cells are arranged in a battery array, the on-cell features generate cooling channels. A forced-convection testbed is used to determine thermal management performance. Shear resistance experiments are used to measure the mechanical resistance of the battery cell assemblies. The study demonstrates that a configuration with parallel channel cell-wall integrated fins recovers the performance of the system with the standard polymer space but provides a 20% improvement in temperature uniformity under fan power control. This configuration, however, lacks mechanical resistance in the assembly. A poka-yoke based configuration with tapered channels enhanced by secondary fins provides mechanical resistances and also performs better in both flow and fan power control. This configuration maintains the cell maximum temperature as the assembly via polymer spacers but improves the temperature uniformity by 50%.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaluminum 3aenergy 3alongevity 3amechanical properties 3apolymers 3atemperature 0aLithium-ion battery 0aPrismatic cell 0aHeatsink 0aInterlocking structure1 aDeng, J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9883-77701 aRobert, B.1 aChen, W.1 aSiegmund, T.0 tEnergy.g2022 Apr. 01, v. 244 p.122580-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12436x0360-54427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2021.1225803Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02387naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245007700170300001400247520133500261592002801596650002401624650001201648650001701660650001801677650002501695650000901720651001201729653001401741653002401755653002501779653001601804773012301820856008501943852000902028655001202037IND60723572520221116153312.0210114e20210102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072357252DNAL7 a10.1080/15427528.2020.17957722doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMorse, Stephen12aA meta-analysis of the technical efficiency of yam production in Nigeria  ap. 69-95.  aThe paper presents the first meta-analysis of yam (Dioscorea rotundata Poir) production studies in Nigeria, with a special emphasis on technical efficiency. The focus was on published studies in journal papers and conferences. For the meta-analysis of production function, a total of 40 studies were included for ware yam and 3 for seed yam, for technical efficiency a total of 23 ware yam and 3 seed yam studies were included and for the farm budget meta-analysis, a total of 22 ware yam and 6 seed yam studies were included. The “peak” years of publication of the ware yam studies were from 2012 to 2014. The bulk of the studies took place in the major yam-growing states, such as Ekiti, Benue, and Kogi. Technical efficiency of yam production varied between and within each of the studies, with an average technical efficiency across studies of between 0.6 and 0.8. The studies highlight the importance of knowledge; it is not just about the quantity of inputs applied but how they are used that matters. The paper notes that meta-analyses of studies designed to explore the factors influencing production of agricultural crops in Nigeria are relatively sparse in number, yet given the importance of agriculture in the country, both for the livelihoods of millions of people, and export, then more such analyses are needed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDioscorea rotundata 3aexports 3afarm budgets 3ameta-analysis 3aproduction functions 3ayams 3aNigeria 0aWhite yam 0aproduction function 0atechnical efficiency 0afarm budget0 tJournal of crop improvement.g2021 Jan. 02, v. 35, no. 1 p.69-95dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl923723x1542-75367nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15427528.2020.17957723Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03504naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001300140245010000153500002000253520199200273592002802265596010302293650002302396650002102419650002502440650001702465650001302482650001402495650001802509650001802527650001302545650001302558650001402571650001902585650001902604650001102623650001202634650001102646650002402657650000902681650001302690650001902703700001602722700005402738773013502792856007402927852000903001655001203010IND60672473620221119233631.0191016e201910  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067247362DNAL7 a10.1111/jfpe.131862doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSun, Rui10aImproved stability of (W1/O/W2) double emulsions based on dual gelation: Oleogels and hydrogels  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe objective of the present study was to improve the stability of (water‐in‐oil‐in‐water) double emulsions by dual gelation, including the gelation of lipid phase through oleogels and the gelation of continuous aqueous phase through hydrogels. Glycerol monostearate (GMS) could be used to form the oleogels and improve the stability of primary emulsions and double emulsions through reinforcing oil film. However, the redundant GMS crystals in both the oil phase and the continuous phase could cause the destabilization of double emulsions. The double emulsions reinforced by oleogels were successfully encapsulated in Ca‐alginate hydrogel beads, and this encapsulation would not influence the integrity of double emulsions. The redundant GMS crystals might cause the leakage of the inner aqueous phase in the encapsulation process, and this leakage was more likely to happen during the mixing step, rather than the crosslinking step. Ca‐alginate hydrogel beads were conducive to the confinement of the encapsulated oil globules. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: The potential applications of (water‐in‐oil‐in‐water [W₁/O/W₂]) double emulsions in food industry are limited by their low stability, including the weakness of the thin liquid oil film and the low thermodynamic stability of oil globules. The combination of oleogels and hydrogels could effectively improve the stability of double emulsions through the reinforcement of the oil film and the confinement of oil globules. This work provides a feasible method to improve the stability of (W₁/O/W₂) double emulsions, obtaining an applicable delivery system for hydrophilic active ingredients in food industry. The stable double emulsions could be used to encapsulate and control the release of hydrophilic bioactive ingredients and protect sensitive bioactive ingredients from chemical degradation. Otherwise, this system might achieve the co‐delivery of hydrophilic ingredients and hydrophobic ingredients.  aPublisher supplied data  aBA2014096cScience and Technology Achievements Transformation Project of Jiangsu Province of China 3aactive ingredients 3acalcium alginate 3achemical degradation 3acrosslinking 3acrystals 3aemulsions 3aencapsulation 3afood industry 3agelation 3aglycerol 3ahydrogels 3ahydrophilicity 3ahydrophobicity 3alipids 3aliquids 3amixing 3aoil-water interface 3aoils 3aoleogels 3athermodynamics1 aZhang, Ming1 aXia, Qiang1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6123-89180 tJournal of food process engineering.g2019 Oct., v. 42, no. 6 p.e13186-dJohn Wiley & Sons, Inc.wJournal:jnl8651x0145-88767nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jfpe.131863Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03918naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245010400168300001600272520201200288592002802300650002902328650002802357650002402385650002002409650001302429650001202442650002602454650001302480650001802493650002302511650001602534650002302550651001502573653002602588653003002614653001502644653002302659653002702682653003102709653003002740700001902770700001902789700005702808700001502865700006002880700002002940700001802960700001602978700001702994700001603011700001803027700001703045700001903062700001603081773010003097856008603197852000903283655001203292IND60527097620221118041908.0190412e201601  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052709762DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecolind.2015.08.0172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMurray, S.N.10aEvaluating ecological states of rocky intertidal communities: A Best Professional Judgment exercise  ap. 802-814.  aA Best Professional Judgment (BPJ) exercise was performed to determine the level of agreement among experts in evaluating the ecological states of western North American rocky intertidal communities. Species-abundance and environmental data from 12 central and 11 southern California sites were provided to 14 experts who independently ranked communities from best to worst and assigned each to one of five categories based on the degree of deviation from an expected natural biological state. Experts achieved Spearman correlations of 0.49 (central California) and 0.30 (southern California) in their rankings and averaged 75.4% and 70.0% Euclidean Similarity (ES) in their community evaluations. These ES values compare favorably with agreement levels found for similar exercises with soft bottom macroinvertebrate assemblages. The experts emphasized macrophytes with functional characteristics related to morphology and sessile macroinvertebrates in their assessments. Several challenges were noted in interpreting rocky intertidal data sets, the most prominent of which are high spatial and temporal variation and site-to-site differences in natural disturbance regimes, features that lead to multiple, expected community states. Experts required detailed, physical habitat descriptions to develop community composition expectations that differed for different shore types, and expressed concern about evaluating rocky intertidal communities based on only a single sampling event. Distinguishing natural from anthropogenic disturbance without information on the sources and magnitudes of anthropogenic perturbation was also found to be challenging because the biological responses to these stressors are often similar. This study underscores the need for long-term data sets that describe the dynamics of populations and communities and rigorous testing of expert judgments to firmly establish broadly applicable and consistent links between community states and anthropogenic stressors on rocky shores.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanthropogenic activities 3aanthropogenic stressors 3acommunity structure 3adata collection 3aexercise 3aexperts 3afunctional properties 3ahabitats 3alittoral zone 3amacroinvertebrates 3amacrophytes 3atemporal variation 3aCalifornia 0aEcological evaluation 0aRocky intertidal habitats 0aMacroalgae 0aMacroinvertebrates 0aBiological communities 0aBest Professional Judgment 0aAnthropogenic disturbance1 aWeisberg, S.B.1 aRaimondi, P.T.1 aAmbrose, R.F.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8653-64871 aBell, C.A.1 aBlanchette, C.A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3004-14231 aBurnaford, J.L.1 aDethier, M.N.1 aEngle, J.M.1 aFoster, M.S.1 aMiner, C.M.1 aNielsen, K.J.1 aPearse, J.S.1 aRichards, D.V.1 aSmith, J.R.0 tEcological indicators.g2016 Jan., v. 60 p.802-814dElsevier LtdwJournal:6196x1470-160X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2015.08.0173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02684naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002400147245014000171300001600311520142900327592002801756650002201784650002001806650001101826650001101837650001001848650002301858650001901881650001101900650001401911650001801925650002001943650001601963650001001979650000901989700002701998700001702025700002002042773011002062856008102172852000902253655001202262IND60579089320221119160713.0170815e201708  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057908932DNAL7 a10.1007/s11104-017-3260-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBanfield, Callum C.10aLabelling plants in the Chernobyl way: A new 137Cs and 14C foliar application approach to investigate rhizodeposition and biopore reuse  ap. 301-315.  aBACKGROUND AND AIMS: Biopores as microbial hotspots provide additional nutrients to crops – but only if their roots grow within the biopores. Such reuse has never been quantified as pre-crop-specific biopores are hardly differentiated from the multitude of pre-existing biopores. Quantification requires e.g. radionuclide labelling of pre-crops (¹³⁷Cs, to label their biopores) and main crops (¹⁴C, to detect new roots). Preliminary testing was performed on simulated biopore reuse: both nuclides given to the same plant were excreted into the same rhizosphere. METHODS: Cichorium intybus (cv. Puna) and Medicago sativa (cv. Planet) were each sequentially labelled via the leaves with ¹³⁷Cs and ¹⁴CO₂. β-signals were visualised by imaging of horizontal soil cuts - with and without shielding off the weaker ¹⁴C. RESULTS: Both species allocated 7.1–9.4% of the ¹³⁷Cs and 21–63% of the ¹⁴C below ground. The first image gave both activities; while the second gave only ¹³⁷Cs. Subtracting the second from the first image gave the ¹⁴C distribution, resulting in successful separation of the signals. Thus, separate spatial representations of the roots were obtained. Main root locations by ¹³⁷Cs and ¹⁴C showed a very high spatial overlap coefficient (> 0.95).

The aim of this study was to evaluate shoot and root biomass accumulation in wheat and barley plants during waterlogging events applied at different stages during preflowering and after stress removal. METHODS: Wheat and barley plants were waterlogged for 15–20 days at four consecutive periods during phenological cycle from emergence to flowering. RESULTS: Waterlogging produced a delayed effect on shoot biomass, as biomass reductions were detected 20 days after waterlogging was released. The highest relative reductions of shoot biomass (60% in wheat and 68–74% in barley regarding control) occurred when waterlogging was applied early in the cycle (from emergence to tillering). Waterlogged plants showed a remarkable capacity to recover from early waterlogging (reaching similar shoot biomass as control plants at flowering), but recovery capacity decreased when waterlogging occurred later in the phenological cycle. For both species green leaf area and photosynthetic rate were reduced and water soluble carbohydrates increased when waterlogging ended, however the general trend showed values at flowering similar to the control plants. The impact of waterlogging on roots was generally higher than the one on shoots and the effect was detected immediately after treatment. The root system capacity to recover after waterlogging was lower than the one for shoots, and was higher in barley than in wheat. CONCLUSIONS: Waterlogging first damaged root biomass while effects on shoots were delayed. Shoot recovery at flowering was possible for waterlogging events previous to stem elongation, but root recovery was lower, especially for wheat.  aPublisher supplied data 3abarley 3abiomass production 3acarbohydrates 3aflooded conditions 3aflowering 3agrain yield 3aleaf area 3aphenology 3aphotosynthesis 3aroot systems 3aroots 3ashoots 3astem elongation 3atillering 3awheat1 aAbeledo, L.

Over 99% of thrips collected were Frankliniella bispinosa (Morgan) (Thysanoptera: Thripidae), with occasional collections of predacious Leptothrips pini (Watson) (Thysanoptera: Phlaeothripidae). Collections of thrips using sticky traps or in tap or brush samples were high at the time of bloom, with low numbers before bloom and very low numbers after bloom. No differences in collections were seen among plots for thrips numbers when sampled using sticky cards. However, one plot had higher thrips numbers when sampled using tap and brush samples. Overall, and especially during bloom, blue sticky traps were most attractive, followed by yellow and then white sticky traps. Clear (color-free) traps collected the fewest thrips. Using tap samples, more thrips were collected on the edges than in the middle of the grove. Highly localized high densities of thrips were detected by the tap samples. Although sticky traps were highly effective for collecting thrips, only tap samples detected the localized hot spots.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFrankliniella 3aLeptothrips 3acolor 3ainsects 3amonitoring 3aolives 3asticky traps 3aFlorida 0aSurveillance 0aFrankliniella bispinosa 0aLeptothrips pini 0aolives1 aGillett-Kaufman, Jennifer L.0 tFlorida entomologist.g2018 Mar., v. 101, no. 1 p.61-68dFlorida Entomological SocietywJournal:jnl44725x1938-51027nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1653/024.101.01123Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/ARS  aDNAL 7aarticle03037naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002300149245014900172300001500321520186100336592002802197650001502225650001602240650001802256650002402274650001802298650002202316650001602338650001902354650001202373650002902385650002202414700002502436773012202461856008302583852000902666655001202675IND60088145920221119132650.0141102e20121201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008814592DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jembe.2012.08.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJohnson, Maggie D.10aOcean acidification and warming decrease calcification in the crustose coralline alga Hydrolithon onkodes and increase susceptibility to grazing  ap. 94-101.  aAnthropogenic CO₂ emissions have exacerbated two environmental stressors, global climate warming and ocean acidification (OA), that have serious implications for marine ecosystems. Coral reefs are vulnerable to climate change yet few studies have explored the potential for interactive effects of warming temperature and OA on an important coral reef calcifier, crustose coralline algae (CCA). Coralline algae serve many important ecosystem functions on coral reefs and are one of the most sensitive organisms to ocean acidification. We investigated the effects of elevated pCO₂ and temperature on calcification of Hydrolithon onkodes, an important species of reef-building coralline algae, and the subsequent effects on susceptibility to grazing by sea urchins. H. onkodes was exposed to a fully factorial combination of pCO₂ (420, 530, 830μatm) and temperature (26, 29°C) treatments, and calcification was measured by the change in buoyant weight after 21days of treatment exposure. Temperature and pCO₂ had a significant interactive effect on net calcification of H. onkodes that was driven by the increased calcification response to moderately elevated pCO₂. We demonstrate that the CCA calcification response was variable and non-linear, and that there was a trend for highest calcification at ambient temperature. H. onkodes then was exposed to grazing by the sea urchin Echinothrix diadema, and grazing was quantified by the change in CCA buoyant weight from grazing trials. E. diadema removed 60% more CaCO₃ from H. onkodes grown at high temperature and high pCO₂ than at ambient temperature and low pCO₂. The increased susceptibility to grazing in the high pCO₂ treatment is among the first evidence indicating the potential for cascading effects of OA and temperature on coral reef organisms and their ecological interactions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEchinoidea 3aHydrolithon 3aacidification 3aambient temperature 3acalcification 3acalcium carbonate 3acoral reefs 3aglobal warming 3agrazing 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3amarine ecosystems1 aCarpenter, Robert C.0 tJournal of experimental marine biology and ecology.g2012 Dec. 1, v. 434-435 p.94-101dElsevier B.V.x0022-09817nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jembe.2012.08.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02915naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001500151245009000166300001600256520174700272592002802019650001902047650001802066650001702084650001402101650001102115650001202126650001702138650000902155650001202164650001302176700001802189700001702207700001502224700001302239700001502252700001502267700001902282773009802301856008502399852000902484655001202493IND60086057120221121112042.0141101e20111024xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008605712DNAL7 a10.1016/j.physbeh.2011.07.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCalvez, J.10aInhibition of food intake induced by acute stress in rats is due to satiation effects  ap. 675-683.  aAcute mild stress induces an inhibition of food intake in rats. In most studies, the cumulative daily food intake is measured but this only provides a quantitative assessment of ingestive behavior. The present study was designed to analyze the reduction in food intake induced by acute stress and to understand which behavioral and central mechanisms are responsible for it. Two different stressors, restraint stress (RS) and forced swimming stress (FSS), were applied acutely to male Wistar rats. We first measured corticosterone and ACTH in plasma samples collected immediately after acute RS and FSS in order to validate our stress models. We measured food intake after RS and FSS and determined meal patterns and behavioral satiety sequences. The expressions of CRF, NPY and POMC in the hypothalamus were also determined immediately after acute RS and FSS. The rise in corticosterone and ACTH levels after both acute RS and FSS validated our models. Furthermore, we showed that acute stress induced a reduction in cumulative food intake which lasted the whole day for RS but only for the first hour after FSS. For both stressors, this stress-induced food intake inhibition was explained by a decrease in meal size and duration, but there was no difference in ingestion speed. The behavioral satiety sequence was preserved after RS and FSS but grooming was markedly increased, which thus competed with, and could reduce, other behaviors, including eating. Lastly, we showed that RS induced an increase in hypothalamic POMC expression. These results suggest that acute stress may affect ingestive behavior by increasing satiation and to some extent by enhancing grooming, and this may be due to stimulation of the hypothalamic POMC neurons.  aPublisher supplied data 3acorticosterone 3acorticotropin 3ahypothalamus 3aingestion 3amodels 3aneurons 3aportion size 3arats 3asatiety 3aswimming1 aFromentin, G.1 aNadkarni, N.1 aDarcel, N.1 aEven, P.1 aTomé, D.,1 aBallet, N.1 aChaumontet, C.0 tPhysiology & behavior.g2011 Oct. 24, v. 104, no. 5 p.675-683dElsevier Inc.x0031-93847nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.physbeh.2011.07.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02742naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003800113040001800151100002000169245006100189300001800250500001500268520131900283592002801602650001101630650001301641650001101654650001101665650002501676650000801701650001401709650001101723650001501734650001701749650004301766650004101809650004601850650002601896650004101922653003601963700001601999700002302015700002102038700002002059773008802079856008402167852000902251655001202260IND60088192920221117042025.0141102e201101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008819292DNAL7 a211228862pmid7 a10.1016/j.watres.2010.10.0242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aUpadhyay, Nabin10aSynthetic musk emissions from wastewater aeration basins  ap. 1071-1078.  a2019-12-06  aWastewater aeration basins at publicly owned treatment works (POTWs) can be emission sources for gaseous or aerosolized sewage material. In the present study, particle and gas phase emissions of synthetic musks from covered and uncovered aeration basins were measured. Galaxolide (HHCB), tonalide (AHTN), and celestolide (ADBI) were the most abundant, ranging from 6704 to 344,306 ng m⁻³, 45–3816 ng m⁻³, and 2–148 ng m⁻³ in the gas phase with particle phase concentrations 3 orders of magnitude lower. The musk species were not significantly removed from the exhaust air by an odor control system, yielding substantial daily emission fluxes (∼200 g d⁻¹ for HHCB) into the atmosphere. However, simple dispersion modeling showed that the treatment plants are unlikely to be a major contributor to ambient air concentrations of these species. Emission of synthetic musk species during wastewater treatment is a substantial fate process; more than 14% of the influent HHCB is emitted to the atmosphere in a POTW as opposed to the <1% predicted by an octanol–water partition coefficient and fugacity-based US EPA fate model. The substantial atmospheric emission of these compounds is most likely due to active stripping that occurs in the aeration basins by bubbling air through the sludge.  aPublisher supplied data 3abasins 3aaeration 3asewage 3amodels 3awastewater treatment 3aair 3aemissions 3asludge 3awastewater 3aodor control 2aFatty Acids, Monounsaturatedxanalysis 2aGas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry 2aOdorantsxanalysisxprevention & control. 2aWaste Disposal, Fluid 2aWater Pollutants, Chemicalxanalysis 0aEnvironmental Protection Agency1 aSun, Qinyue1 aAllen, Jonathan O.1 aWesterhoff, Paul1 aHerckes, Pierre0 tWater research.g2011 Jan., v. 45, no. 3 p.1071-1078dElsevier Ltdx0043-13547nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.watres.2010.10.0243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02327naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100001900142245015000161300001400311520108500325592002801410650002401438650001401462650001601476650001201492650001001504650001001514650001901524650001901543650001701562653000901579653002201588653001501610653001201625653002301637700001901660700002601679773012601705856007701831852000901908655001201917IND60594396120221118012644.0180625e201803  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059439612DNAL7 a10.1653/024.101.01132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRobledo, Norma10aModification of Behavioral Response in Copitarsia decolora (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) Due to Pre-Exposure to Sex Pheromone and Host Plant Volatiles  ap. 69-73.  aIn this study we assessed the effect of pre-exposure to host sex pheromones and plant volatiles on the response of virgin males and mated females of Copitarsia decolora (Guenée) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae), by using glandular extracts of virgin females and host volatile extracts in bioassays conducted in a wind tunnel. Four-day-old insects, either virgin males pre-exposed to glandular extracts of the sex pheromone or mated females pre-exposed to host volatiles, were evaluated 2, 24, and 48 h after pre-exposure. In both sexes, pre-exposure and a subsequent attraction response at 2 h resulted in an inhibitory effect on the olfactory response. Recovery in the olfactory response was observed at 24 and 48 h; however, it took males a shorter activation time when compared with control insects. A brief pre-exposure of insects provoked a short-term (2 h) inhibition of the response to the olfactory stimulus. Consequently, as an integral part of strategies for the management of this pest species, the study of the ecological implications of such inhibition should be considered.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCopitarsia decolora 3abioassays 3ahost plants 3ainsects 3amales 3apests 3asex pheromones 3avirgin females 3awind tunnels 0aMoth 0aglandular extract 0aattraction 0alatency 0aolfactory stimulus1 aArzuffi, René1 aReyes-Prado, Humberto0 tFlorida entomologist.g2018 Mar., v. 101, no. 1 p.69-73dFlorida Entomological SocietywJournal:jnl44725x1938-51027nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1653/024.101.01133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03231naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100001900141245015000160500001400310520180100324592002802125650002302153650002202176650001602198650002902214650001502243650003502258650001402293650001602307650000902323650001502332650001602347650003302363650001702396650002102413651001002434700001802444700001702462700001602479700002002495700001402515773016002529856007502689852000902764655001202773IND60711726220221118110443.0200928e20200908xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071172622DNAL7 a10.3390/ijgi90905392doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuang, Faming 10aRegional Terrain Complexity Assessment Based on Principal Component Analysis and Geographic Information System: A Case of Jiangxi Province, China  aNAL-light  aRegional terrain complexity assessment (TCA) is an important theoretical foundation for geological feature identification, hydrological information extraction and land resources utilization. However, the previous TCA models have many disadvantages; for example, comprehensive consideration and redundancy information analysis of terrain factors is lacking, and the terrain complexity index is difficult to quantify. To overcome these drawbacks, a TCA model based on principal component analysis (PCA) and a geographic information system (GIS) is proposed. Taking Jiangxi province of China as an example, firstly, ten terrain factors are extracted using a digital elevation model (DEM) in GIS software. Secondly, PCA is used to analyze the information redundancy of these terrain factors and deal with data compression. Then, the comprehensive evaluation of the compressed terrain factors is conducted to obtain quantitative terrain complexity indexes and a terrain complexity map (TCM). Finally, the TCM produced by the PCA method is compared with those produced by the slope-only, the variation coefficient and K-means clustering models based on the topographic map drawn by the Bureau of Land and Resources of Jiangxi province. Meanwhile, the TCM is also verified by the actual three-dimensional aerial images. Results show that the correlation coefficients between the TCMs produced by the PCA, slope-only, variable coefficient and K-means clustering models and the local topographic map are 0.894, 0.763, 0.816 and 0.788, respectively. It is concluded that the TCM of the PCA method matches well with the actual field terrain features, and the PCA method can reflect the regional terrain complexity characteristics more comprehensively and accurately when compared to the other three methods.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaerial photography 3acomputer software 3acorrelation 3adigital elevation models 3aextraction 3ageographic information systems 3ahydrology 3ainformation 3aland 3alandscapes 3amethodology 3aprincipal component analysis 3aspatial data 3atopographic maps 3aChina1 aYang, Jianbo 1 aZhang, Biao 1 aLi, Yijing 1 aHuang, Jinsong 1 aChen, Na 0 tISPRS international journal of geo-information.g2020 Sept. 08, v. 9, no. 9dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21619x2220-99647nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijgi90905393Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03149naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001400147245013400161300001200295520140500307592002801712650001201740650001901752650001301771650001301784650002101797650002001818650002201838650001501860650001901875650003701894650001101931651001001942653001201952653002201964653002301986653000802009653002502017653002102042653001302063653000802076653003002084653002702114653002302141653001202164653000802176653002702184653002502211700002402236700001702260700001502277700002502292700002502317773011402342856008202456852000902538655001202547IND60516006120221120190319.0190805e201506  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051600612DNAL7 a10.1017/S20786336140004842doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNgeno, K.10aGenetic diversity of different indigenous chicken ecotypes using highly polymorphic MHC-linked and non-MHC microsatellite markers  ap. 1-7.  aThe study investigated the genetic make-up of different ecotypes of indigenous chickens (ICs) in Kenya based on major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-linked and non-MHC microsatellite markers. Blood samples were collected from eight regions (48 birds per region) of Kenya: Kakamega (KK), Siaya (BN), West Pokot (WP), Turkana (TK), Bomet (BM), Narok (NR), Lamu (LM) and Taita-Taveta (TT) and genotyped using two MHC-linked and ten non-MHC markers. All MHC-linked and non-MHC markers were polymorphic with a total of 140 alleles, of which 56 were identified in MHC-linked markers. Mean number of alleles (Na and Ne), private alleles, heterozygosity and genetic distances were higher for MHC-linked markers compared with non-MHC markers. The ad hoc statistic ΔK detected the true numbers of clusters to be three for MHC-linked markers and two in non-MHC markers. In conclusion, Kenyan ICs belong into two to three genetically distinct groups. Different markers systems have different clustering system. MHC-linked markers divided ICs into three mixed clusters, composing of individuals from the different ecotypes whereas non-MHC markers grouped ICs into two groups. These IC ecotypes host many and highly diverse MHC-linked alleles. Higher allelic diversity indicated a huge amount of genetic variation in the MHC region of ICs and supported their reputation of being hardy and resistant to diseases.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalleles 3ablood sampling 3achickens 3aecotypes 3agenetic distance 3agenetic markers 3agenetic variation 3agenotyping 3aheterozygosity 3amajor histocompatibility complex 3asodium 3aKenya 0aecotype 0agenetic diversity 0aindigenous chicken 0aMHC 0apopulation structure 0apoule autochtone 0aécotype 0aCMH 0astructure populationnelle 0adiversité génétique 0agallina autóctona 0aecotipo 0aCMH 0aestructura poblacional 0adiversidad genética1 avan der Waaij, E.H.1 aMegens, H.J.1 aKahi, A.K.1 avan Arendonk, J.A.M.1 aCrooijmans, R.P.M.A.0 tAnimal genetic resources.g2015 June, v. 56 p.1-7dCambridge University PresswJournal:23118x2078-63447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S20786336140004843Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03701naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002300150245011400173300001600287520227000303592002802573650001002601650002402611650001502635650001102650650003002661650002202691650001702713650002302730650001002753650001502763650001502778650001702793650000902810651001202819653002002831653001902851653001602870653001402886653002202900653001402922700002302936700002202959700001602981773011602997856008503113852000903198655001203207IND60542519620221119054503.0190403e20140201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054251962DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foreco.2013.11.0192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJuutilainen, Katja14aThe effects of forest management on wood-inhabiting fungi occupying dead wood of different diameter fractions  ap. 283-291.  aForest management has caused severe ecological degradation throughout the Globe. One of its most prominent consequences is the drastic change in dead wood profile and consequently in the dead wood dependent biota. Wood-inhabiting fungi are, considering ecosystem functions, the most important species group utilizing dead wood, because they take care of majority of the decaying process. The earlier research focusing on the effects of forest management on wood-inhabiting fungi has strongly focused on large dead wood pieces (i.e. coarse woody debris, CWD), even though it has been shown that a major part of fungal diversity utilizes (also) small dead wood pieces (i.e. [very] fine woody debris, [V]FWD). In this paper, we studied the effects of earlier forest management on the wood-inhabiting fungi occupying all dead wood diameter fractions including the smallest pieces. The study was conducted in boreal pine and spruce dominated forests in Finland. Altogether we surveyed corticioid and polyporoid fungi from 113,269 dead wood pieces in 8 previously managed and 8 natural forests. The composition of fungal community varied between the forest types (pine vs. spruce; managed vs. natural) and according to the diameter of the dead wood substrate. However, the fungal diversity occupying CWD, and some diameter fractions of FWD, was clearly lower in managed than natural spruce dominated forests. Moreover, most of the rare species were detected only in natural forests, especially spruce dominated, and based on the species accumulation curves these sites were also the ones where largest proportion of community remained undetected. The effects of earlier forest management are evident also in fungal communities occupying FWD. The effects are, however, clearly stronger in CWD and especially in spruce dominated forests. Consequently, the main focus in forest conservation and restoration efforts may still be targeted on increasing CWD volume in managed landscapes, but simultaneously attention must be targeted on retaining reasonable volume of FWD to ensure that the species specialized in utilizing it will not be driven to local extinctions. Combining this recommendation with increasing pressure for energy wood harvesting will remain as a challenge.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPicea 3acoarse woody debris 3aecosystems 3aenergy 3aenvironmental degradation 3aforest management 3aforest types 3afungal communities 3afungi 3aharvesting 3alandscapes 3arare species 3awood 3aFinland 0aAphyllophorales 0aBoreal forests 0aCorticioids 0aDead wood 0aForest management 0aPolypores1 aMönkkönen, Mikko1 aKotiranta, Heikki1 aHalme, Panu0 tForest ecology and management.g2014 Feb. 01, v. 313 p.283-291dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl9013x0378-11277nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foreco.2013.11.0193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01793naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002800150245008500178300001800263520066900281592002800950650002200978650002301000650002301023650001501046650001101061650002201072650002001094653001101114653002801125653002801153653001401181653001601195700002601211773008901237856008401326852000901410655001201419IND60529280720221119050845.0161019e20160316xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052928072DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tetlet.2016.02.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aElumalai, Vijayaragavan10aIndium powder as the reducing agent in the synthesis of 2-amino-1,1′-biphenyls  ap. 1224-1226.  aAn improved and simplified In-based protocol for the reduction of 2-nitro-1,1′-biphenyls to the corresponding 2-amino-1,1′-biphenyls is disclosed.

(Giant ragweed)  ap. 35-47.  aResource is Open Access  aAmbrosia trifida L. belongs to the group of invasive weeds, which in colonized areas cause great damage to the biodiversity of autochthonous flora and vegetation as well as in plant production. It originates from North America wherefrom it has spread to many parts of Europe. In Serbia it is currently locally present in the area of Bačka (the northern region of the country). Early and rapid growth rate, vegetative and generative production, high degree of morphological and reproductive plasticity have given it a competitive advantage over many other weeds, hence in many countries it is considered one of the most problematic weeds in agricultural production. A. trifida could cause great damage in root crops, vegetable gardens and orchards and its harmfulness is measured by the negative impact on biodiversity by suppressing indigenous and other non-indigenous species. With its allergens, A. trifida negatively affects human health. Observing its vegetative and generative potential and climate change on the other hand, recent research indicates the potential for the spread of A. trifida in our country and in Europe, which could be a serious risk for agrophytocenoses and the ecosystem as a whole. In 2019, it was added to the EPPO A2 List of quarantine pests recommended. It can be controlled with the use of mechanical, biological and chemical measures.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aAmbrosia trifida 3abiodiversity 3aclimate change 3aecosystems 3aflora 3ahuman health 3aquarantine 3arisk 3avegetables 3avegetation 3aNorth America 3aSerbia 0aambrosia trifida l. 0aambrosia spp. 0aallergenic species 0acompetition 0ainvasive weeds 0asecondary metabolites 0aweed control 0ayield losses0 tZbornik Matice srpske za prirodne nauke.g2021, v. 2021, no. 141 p.35-47dMatica srpskawJournal:27734x2406-08287nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2298/ZMSPN2141035S3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04104naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100002200141245009700163300001600260520269300276592002802969650001002997650001103007650000803018650001503026650001903041650002203060650001803082650001903100650002403119650001403143650001603157650001403173650001903187650001203206650002003218650001203238650001803250650001003268650002603278700001703304700002203321700002003343700002003363700002003383773011103403856007503514852000903589655001203598IND60586511020221122220433.0171213s2018    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058651102DNAL7 a10.1071/RDv30n1Ab232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCastañeda, F. K.10a24 Evaluation of Latrunculin A for the Activation of Hand-Made Cloning (HMC) Porcine Embryos  ap. 151-152.  aSomatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT) is an important biotechnological tool. However, production rates of viable offspring remain low. One possible cause of this low efficiency is chromosomal losses during early activation process (Liu et al. 2015 Cell. Reprogram. 17, 463–471). The use of actin inhibitors that block second polar body extrusion during activation protocols might be a strategy to avoid such losses. The objective of this work was to compare the efficiency of the use of 2 actin inhibitors during the activation of hand-made cloning (HMC) porcine embryos. One of the compounds used was latrunculin A (LatA), which joins directly to actin monomers, preventing their assembly to the filaments. The other was cytochalasin B (CB), which is commonly used for activation protocols. It binds to the growing actin filaments and prevents their elongation. For this purpose, in vitro-matured cumulus–oocyte compexes were deprived of their cumulus and zonae pellucidae cells by mechanical and enzymatic treatments. Oocytes were randomly distributed in 2 experimental groups (HMC) and 2 parthenogenetic control groups (PA). For HMC groups, oocytes were bisected using a microblade and the resulting hemioocytes were stained with Hoechst 33342 and observed under UV light to identify those that had lost the metaphase II plate. Adult skin fibroblasts from primary cultures were used as nuclear donors. For nuclear transfer, 2 hemicytoplasts were fused to a donor cell by an electric pulse of 1.42 kV/cm for 30 μs. After 2h of nuclear reprogramming, the reconstituted embryos were activated by an electric pulse of 1.2kV/cm for 80 μs and incubated with cycloheximide (CHX, 10μgmL-1 , 3h) in combination with one of the actin inhibitors: LatA 2 μM (CHX-LatA goup) or CB 2.5μgmL-1 (CHX-CB group). The PA groups were subjected to the same activation treatments (PA-CHX+LatA and PA-CHX+CB groups). All embryos were cultured in SOFaa medium, using an adaptation of the well-of-the-well (WOW) system (microwells), in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2 in air at 39°C. Cleavage, morulae, and blastocysts rates were evaluated at Days 2, 4, and 7-8, respectively. At least 3 replicates were performed per group. Results are presented in Table 1. Our results demonstrate that the production of embryos by HMC activated with CHX-LatA is as efficient as that with CHX-CB, the protocol currently used in SCNT protocols. Further research is needed to study its effect on chromosomal complements and long-term development.

Two experiments were conducted to determine CH4 production of cattle that differed in feed efficiency. Cattle in both studies were selected from larger contemporary groups. Animals furthest from the confidence ellipse that resulted from regressing BW gain on DMI were selected. In the first experiment, 113 crossbred steers were evaluated for feed efficiency for 64 d. Steers were 355 ± 1 d of age and weighed 456 ± 10 kg when they began the study. Steers were fed a ration that consisted of (DM basis) 82.8% corn, 12.8% corn silage, and 4.5% supplement [contains 0.065% monensin, 32% CP (28% NPN), 7.5% Ca, 0.8% P, 4.8% NaCl, 1.8% K, and 55,116 IU/kg vitamin A]. Thirty-seven steers were selected to measure CH4 production. In the second experiment, 197 heifers were evaluated for feed efficiency for 64 d. Heifers were 286 ± 1 d of age and weighed 327 ± 2 kg when they began the study. Heifers were fed a ration that consisted of (DM basis) 60% corn silage, 30% alfalfa hay, and 10% wet distillers grains with solubles. Forty-seven heifers were selected to measure CH4 production. Methane production was measured with respiration calorimeters. In both experiments, cattle had ad libitum access to feed, and DMI consumed during the 24 h before CH4 production was measured. Methane production was collected for a 6-h period on untrained cattle. Consequently, methane production is not a quantitative measure of daily methane production; rather, it is an index value to rank cattle. Multiple regression analysis was used to determine the relationship between either BW gain:DMI ratio or residual feed intake (RFI) on CH4 production after adjusting for the previous 24-h DMI. In the steers, BW gain:DMI ratio and previous 24-h feed intake accounted for little of the variance in CH4 production (R2 = 0.009), and neither did RFI and previous 24-h feed intake (R2 = 0.001). In the heifers, the BW gain:DMI ratio contributed 28% toward the variance estimate and previous 24-h DMI contributed 72% toward the variance estimate (R2 = 0.31). As the BW gain:DMI ratio increased, daily CH4 production increased. The regression coefficient for RFI (P = 0.45) did not differ from 0 for CH4 production. Our study does not support our original hypothesis that CH4 production decreases with increased feed efficiency and suggests that CH4 production may increase with increased feed efficiency.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalfalfa hay 3abeef cattle 3acalorimeters 3acattle feeding 3acattle production 3acorn 3acorn silage 3adistillers grains 3afeed conversion 3afeed intake 3afeed supplements 3aheifers 3amethane 3amethane production 3amonensin 3aregression analysis 3arumen fermentation 3asodium chloride 3asteers 3avariance 3avitamin A1 aBrown-Brandl, T.

We examined N canopy budgets of 27 Central European forests of varying dominant tree species, stand density, and tree and shrub species diversity (Shannon index) in three study regions by quantifying bulk and fine particulate dry deposition and dissolved below canopy N fluxes. Average regional canopy N retention ranged from 16% to 51%, because of differences in the N status of the ecosystems. Canopy N budgets of coniferous forests differed from deciduous forest which we attribute to differences in biogeochemical N cycling, tree functional traits and canopy surface area. The canopy budgets of N were related to the Shannon index which explained 14% of the variance of the canopy budgets of N, suggesting complementary aboveground N use of trees and diverse understorey vegetation. The relationship between plant diversity and canopy N retention varied among regional site conditions and forest types. Our results suggest that the traditional view of belowground complementarity of nutrient uptake by roots in diverse plant communities can be transferred to foliar uptake in forest canopies.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiogeochemical cycles 3aconiferous forests 3adeciduous forests 3adry deposition 3aecosystems 3afoliar uptake 3aforest canopy 3anitrogen 3anutrient uptake 3aroots 3ashrubs 3aspecies diversity 3astand density 3asurface area 3atrees 3aunderstory 3avariance 3aCentral European region 0aTerrestrial nitrogen cycling 0aNitrogen deposition 0aCanopy N retention 0aEcosystem functioning 0aComplementarity 0aBiodiversity Exploratories1 aBischoff, Sebastian1 aBlaser, Stefan1 aBoch, Steffen1 aSchmitt, Barbara1 aThieme, Lisa1 aFischer, Markus1 aMichalzik, Beate1 aSchulze, Ernst-Detlef1 aSiemens, Jan1 aWilcke, Wolfgang0 tForest ecology and management.g2014 Feb. 01, v. 313 p.274-282dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl9013x0378-11277nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foreco.2013.11.0213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle
