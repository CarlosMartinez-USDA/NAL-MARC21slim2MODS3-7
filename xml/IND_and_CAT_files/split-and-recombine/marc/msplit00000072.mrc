This enzyme was purified by a combination of salt-induced phase separation, hydroxylapatite fractionation, hydrophobic interaction and strong anion-exchange chromatography, and denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, followed by renaturation with Tween 80. The purified enzyme has a molecular weight of 64-65 kDa, and exhibited a single silver-staining band fo11owing electrophoresis in analytical denaturing polyacrylamide gels. Amino acid sequences of three tryptic peptides from the enzyme have been determined and are similar to known sequences in other terpene cyclases from plants. 3asesquiterpenoids 3abiosynthesis 3amolecular weight 3aGossypium hirsutum 3acotyledons 3aamino acid sequences 3aligases 3apathogenicity 3adisease resistance 3aenzyme activity 3amolecular conformation 3aleaves 3aphytoalexins 0apurification 0amolecular sequence data 0achemical structure1 aTsuji, J.1 aDavis, G.D.1 aPierce, M.L.1 aEssenberg, M.0 tPhytochemistry.g1996 Mar., v. 41, no. 4 p.1047-1055x0031-94227nnas  aDNAL  a19960605b19960611c00000000  aINDdMKS  aNon-US 7aarticle02664naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146072001700164100001600181245005500197300001600252520103500268650001001303650001001313650004301323650002201366650002301388650001401411650002001425650001301445650001301458650002301471650002501494650002101519650001201540650001301552650004501565650002001610650001201630650001101642650000901653650004201662650002801704653002201732700001601754700001601770700001501786700001301801700001601814773008101830852000901911856008501920930003302005945002502038946001102063655001202074IND4394393320221120052613.0070824e200706  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439439332DNAL7 a175786952pmid7 a10.1080/000716607013704592doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aHuang, C.W.10aAFLP fingerprinting for paternity testing in ducks  ap. 323-330.  a1. The accuracy and reproducibility of AFLP fingerprinting was investigated in the duck (Anas Platyrhynchos), using a multicolour fluorescent labeling technique. The fluorescent labelling fragments were separated on a capillary electrophoresis-base ABI PRISM 3100 Genetic Analyzer. 2. A total of 337 AFLP peaks with 103 of them being polymorphic markers were generated by 16 sets consisting of EcoRI/TaqI primer pair combinations. The number and size range of AFLP polymorphisms detected per primer pair varied from 3 to 11 and 58 to 290 bp, respectively. About 30.6% (103/337) of AFLP peaks were detected polymorphisms, with an average of 6.4 polymorphic markers per primer pair. 3. The clear polymorphic peaks were amplified with EcoR+AC/Taq+AC primer combinations. The AFLP peaks showed high reproducibility. From the family testing, we found that the fingerprints of all the offspring were derived from one or other parent. Therefore, we conclude that AFLP fingerprinting might be a suitable method for duck paternity testing. 3aducks 3amales 3aamplified fragment length polymorphism 3agenetic variation 3aDNA fingerprinting 3apaternity 3agenetic markers 3agenotype 3aaccuracy 3aAnas platyrhynchos 3agenetic polymorphism 2aAnimal Husbandry 2aAnimals 2aBreeding 2aDNA Fingerprintingxmethodsxveterinary. 2aDucksxgenetics 2aFathers 2aFemale 2aMale 2aNucleic Acid Amplification Techniques 2aQuantitative Trait Loci 0apaternity testing1 aCheng, Y.S.1 aRouvier, R.1 aYang, K.T.1 aWu, C.P.1 aHuang, M.C.0 tBritish poultry science.g2007 June, v. 48, no. 3 p.323-330x0007-16687nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/000716607013704593Available from publisher's Web site  a20080207b20080301c00000000  aINDd2CTe2007/10/30  aNon-US 7aarticle01404naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002500110245007800135300001800213500001500231520035200246650002300598650001500621650001100636650002600647650002500673650002500698650001900723650002100742650001300763650001600776653001500792653002300807653001500830700002100845773007400866852000900940930003300949945001300982946001100995655001201006IND2051091020221120052512.0960502e199603  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205109102DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDemyttenaere, J.C.R.10aBiotransformation of geraniol and nerol by spores of Penicillium italicum  ap. 1079-1082.  a2019-12-05  aA simple and efficient method was developed to carry out biotransformation reactions on volatile terpenoid compounds.

  1 aRoy, B.C.10aHistochemical properties and collagen architecture of M. iliotibialis lateralis and M. puboischiofemoralis in male broilers with different growth rates induced by feeding at different planes of nutrition  ap. 312-322.  a1. The histochemical properties and the collagen content and architecture of the iliotibialis lateralis (ITL) and puboischiofemoralis (PIF) muscles were assessed in Red Cornish x New Hampshire cockerels reared on a high nutrient plane for 80 d (H80d), or a low nutrient plane for 80 d (L80d) or 95 d (L95d). 2. Final live weights were 3410 g in H80d, 2810 g in L80d and 3467 g in L95d. Both ITL and PIF muscle weights were lowest in L80d and did not differ between H80d and L95d. 3. ITL muscle was composed of fast-twitch myofibres such as IIA (high reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide dehydrogenase, NADH-DH activity), IIB (low NADH-DH activity) and IIC (intermediate NADH-DH activity). The high percentage of type IIB myofibres in H80d (76.6%) and L95d (76.2%) birds were reflected in low percentages of type IIC myofibres (12.2%) in H80d birds and type IIA myofibres (8.2%) in L95d birds. Percentages of IIA, IIB and IIC myofibres in L80d cockerels were 12.4, 69.8 and 17.6%, respectively. 4. The myofibres in PIF muscle were divided into two basic types, I and IIA, and a transitional form (I-tr) from IIA to I. In the caudal region, all myofibres in H80d and L95d cockerels were type I but in L80d cockerels 15% of myofibres were categorised as type I-tr. In the cranial region, the great majority (52 to 63%) of myofibres were type IIA. Type I myofibres occurred at a higher percentage in H80d (30.5%) than L95d (21.8%) and type I-tr in L95d (15.7%) than H80d (7.3%) and L80d (11.5%). 5. The total amount of collagen was higher in ITL than PIF muscle in every bird group. In both muscles the highest collagen content was in L95d cockerels but the content did not differ between H80d and L80d birds. The thickness of thick and thin perimysia increased with muscle size. The circular collagen fibre in the thick perimysium was larger in ITL (6.1 to 7.0 micrometer) than PIF (3.7 to 3.8 micrometer) muscle but did not differ among the bird groups. 6. From these results, it was concluded that feeding on a high nutritional plane promotes growth of the thigh muscles, with accompanying enlargement of the perimysial thickness, no increase in collagen content and various changes of histochemical properties. 3abroiler chickens 3ahistochemistry 3askeletal muscle 3acollagen 3aanimal growth 3abroiler feeding 3afeeding level 3abody weight 3aliveweight gain 3aanimal age 3aweight 3amyofibrils 3aNADH dehydrogenase 3aenzyme activity 3achemical composition 2aAnimal Feed 2aAnimal Husbandry 2aAnimal Nutritional Physiological Phenomena 2aAnimals 2aChickensxgrowth & development 2aCollagenxmetabolism 2aDietxveterinary 2aImmunohistochemistry 2aMale 2aMuscle Fibers, Skeletalxcytologyxmetabolism. 2aMuscle, Skeletalxanatomy & histologyxphysiology. 0ailiotibialis lateralis 0apuboischiofemoralis 0aperimysia1 aOshima, I.1 aMiyachi, H.1 aShiba, N.1 aNishimura, S.1 aTabata, S.1 aIwamoto, H.0 tBritish poultry science.g2007 June, v. 48, no. 3 p.312-322x0007-16687nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/000716607013704913Available from publisher's Web site  a20080207b20080301c00000000  aINDd2CTe2007/10/30  aNon-US 7aarticle02410naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245010300127300001600230500001500246520123000261650002801491650001001519650001301529650001301542650001101555650001501566650001801581650001101599650001201610650001401622650001301636651001101649653002401660653002201684653002201706653001301728653001401741700001701755700001901772773009501791852000901886930003301895945001301928946001101941655001201952IND2207628820221120052608.0001104e200002  ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220762882DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSvensson, B.10aHabitat preferences of nest-seeking bumble bees (Hymenoptera: Apidae) in an agricultural landscape  ap. 247-255.  a2019-12-05  aThe aim of this study was to find out where bumble bee queens place their nests in the agricultural landscape. Nest-seeking behaviour was used to indicate nesting site preferences. Four types of agricultural landscape were investigated near Uppsala, Sweden; open, relatively open, relatively wooded and wooded. Twelve 500-metre-long transects, each including several intermingled habitats (e.g., field boundaries, pastures, clearings), were inspected repeatedly over a two-month period, from April to June 1991. In total, 147 observations of bumble bee queens (Bombus spp.)of eight species were recorded. Nest-seeking queens were observed most frequently along forest boundaries and field boundaries, in open uncultivated areas and in the relatively open landscape, whereas they were least frequent in forest and in clearings. Fields, pastures and road boundaries had intermediate frequencies. Differences among species were found in terms of both landscape type and habitat preferences: B. terrestris, B. lapidarius, B. sylvarum and B. subterranius preferred open terrain, whereas B. lucorum and B. pascuorum preferred forest boundaries. Withered grass and tussocks were the preferred nest-seeking patches among all species. 3ainterspecific variation 3anests 3aecotones 3apastures 3afields 3alandscapes 3aqueen insects 3aBombus 3anesting 3awoodlands 3ahabitats 3aSweden 0aspecies differences 0aagricultural land 0ahabitat selection 0aclearing 0aroadsides1 aLagerlof, J.1 aSvensson, B.G.0 tAgriculture, ecosystems & environment.g2000 Feb., v. 77, no. 3 p.247-255x0167-88097nnas  aDNAL  a20001204b20001212c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US 7aarticle03585naa a2200685 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111072001700129072001700146100001700163245012900180300001600309520160600325650001701931650001001948650001201958650001701970650002801987650001602015650001502031650001802046650002402064650002302088650002402111650002602135650004702161650001202208650002402220650002202244650002802266650002702294650001102321650001702332650001502349650004502364650002202409650000902431650004302440650002602483650001202509650004202521653001802563653002102581700001702602700001602619700002102635700001502656700001602671700001802687700001802705773008602723852000902809930003302818945002502851946001102876655001202887IND4400161220221120050048.0080118e200711  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440016122DNAL7 a175372942pmid  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aFricke, C.B.10aIncreased plant sterol and stanol levels in brain of Watanabe rabbits fed rapeseed oil derived plant sterol or stanol esters  ap. 890-899.  aFoods containing plant sterol or stanol esters can be beneficial in lowering LDL-cholesterol concentration, a major risk factor for CVD. The present study examined whether high dietary intake of rapeseed oil (RSO) derived plant sterol and stanol esters is associated with increased levels of these components in brain tissue of homozygous and heterozygous Watanabe rabbits, an animal model for familial hypercholesterolemia. Homozygous animals received either a standard diet, RSO stanol or RSO sterol ester while heterozygous animals were additionally fed with 2 g cholesterol/kg to the respective diet form for 120 d (n 9 for each group). Concentrations of cholesterol, its precursor lathosterol, plant sterols and stanols in brain and additionally in liver and plasma were determined by highly sensitive GC-MS. High-dose intake of RSO derived plant sterols and stanols resulted in increased levels of these components in plasma and liver. In brain a limited uptake of plant sterols and stanols was proven, indicating that these compounds passed the blood-brain barrier and may be retained in the brain tissue of Watanabe rabbits. Plant stanol ester feeding lowered plant sterol levels in brain, liver, and plasma. Cholesterol synthesis in brain, indicated by lathosterol, a local surrogate cholesterol synthesis marker, does not seem to be affected by plant sterol or stanol ester feeding. We conclude that high dose intake of plant sterol and stanol esters in Watanabe rabbits results in elevated concentrations of these components not only in the periphery but also in the central nervous system. 3aphytosterols 3abrain 3arabbits 3arapeseed oil 3acardiovascular diseases 3adietary fat 3afat intake 3aanimal models 3ablood-brain barrier 3aendogenous sources 3adietary supplements 2aAnimal Feedxanalysis 2aAnimal Nutritional Physiological Phenomena 2aAnimals 2aBlood-Brain Barrier 2aBrainxmetabolism 2aCholesterolxmetabolism 2aDisease Models, Animal 2aFemale 2aHeterozygote 2aHomozygote 2aHyperlipoproteinemia Type IIxmetabolism 2aLiverxmetabolism 2aMale 2aPhytosterolsxbloodxpharmacokinetics. 2aPlant Oilsxchemistry 2aRabbits 2aSitosterolsxbloodxpharmacokinetics. 0astanol esters 0aWatanabe rabbits1 aSchroder, M.1 aPoulsen, M.1 aBergmann, K. von1 aWester, I.1 aKnudsen, I.1 aMortensen, A.1 aLutjohann, D.0 tBritish journal of nutrition.g2007 Nov., v. 98, no. 5 p.890-899x0007-11457nnas  aDNAL  a20080428b20080502c00000000  aINDd3CTe2008/04/04  aNon-US 7aarticle03174naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146072001700164072001700181100001600198245008800214300001600302520159200318650001601910650001601926650002101942650002001963650001601983650001401999650002002013650002102033650001902054650001502073650002202088650001602110650001602126650001002142650003002152650001202182650002502194650001102219650001002230650002802240650001602268650001702284653002102301700001502322700001502337773008102352852000902433856008502442930003302527945002502560946001102585655001202596IND4394392720221120050116.0070824e200706  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439439272DNAL7 a175786892pmid7 a10.1080/000716607013705252doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aLewis, P.D.10aRearing photoperiod and abrupt versus gradual photostimulation for egg-type pullets  ap. 276-283.  a1. Lohmann White and Lohmann Brown egg-type hybrids were reared on 6-, 8-, 10- or 12-h photoperiods, transferred to 12.5 h at 18 weeks and then given weekly increments to reach 14 h at 21 weeks. In a second experiment, Lohmann White pullets from the same rearing facility were transferred abruptly to 14 h at 18 weeks. 2. Body weight gain and feed intake to 6 and 18 weeks were positively correlated with rearing photoperiod in both breeds. Mortality to 18 weeks was unaffected. 3. Whether the photoperiod was increased abruptly or in a series of increments, Lohmann White pullets reared on 6 or 8 h matured 4 to 6 d later than pullets reared on 10 or 12 h. Rearing day-length had little effect on sexual maturity in Lohmann Brown pullets. 4. In both genotypes and each experiment, egg numbers, egg weight and shell strength increased with rearing photoperiod. Feed intake in the laying period was not significantly affected by rearing day-length, but a meta-analysis of all data showed a significant, though small, increase in adult feed intake with rearing photoperiod. Despite Lohmann White birds reared on 6 and 8 h having lower body weights throughout the laying period, they had larger body weight gains between 18 and 70 weeks than those reared on 10 or 12 h. There were no clear effects of rearing photoperiod on albumen height or mortality. 5. The heavier eggs and stronger shells of the birds reared on the longer day-lengths were correlated with heavier body weights at 18 weeks, and the superior egg numbers and higher feed intake were associated with age at sexual maturity. 3alaying hens 3aphotoperiod 3aanimal husbandry 3aliveweight gain 3afeed intake 3amortality 3asexual maturity 3aage at first egg 3aegg production 3aegg weight 3aegg shell quality 3abody weight 3aegg albumen 2aAging 2aAnimal Husbandryxmethods 2aAnimals 2aChickensxphysiology 2aFemale 2aLight 2aOvipositionxphysiology 2aPhotoperiod 2aTime Factors 0aphotostimulation1 aCaston, L.1 aLeeson, S.0 tBritish poultry science.g2007 June, v. 48, no. 3 p.276-283x0007-16687nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/000716607013705253Available from publisher's Web site  a20080207b20080301c00000000  aINDd2CTe2007/10/30  aNon-US 7aarticle03169naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111072001700129072001700146100001700163245013700180300001600317520149700333650003001830650002301860650001001883650001801893650000901911650002001920650001701940650002401957650002201981650002602003650005902029650001202088650001602100650007002116650007402186650002202260650001902282650001902301650003202320650001502352650002402367700001502391700001502406700001702421700001302438773008602451852000902537930003302546945002502579946001102604655001202615IND4400161520221120031901.0080118e200711  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440016152DNAL7 a175372932pmid  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aJakobsen, J.10a25-Hydroxyvitamin D3 affects vitamin D status similar to vitamin D3 in pigs - but the meat produced has a lower content of vitamin D  ap. 908-913.  aIn food databases, the specific contents of vitamin D3 and 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 in food have been implemented in the last 10 years. No consensus has yet been established on the relative activity between the components. Therefore, the objective of the present study was to assess the relative activity of 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 compared to vitamin D3. The design was a parallel study in pigs (n 24), which from an age of 12 weeks until slaughter 11 weeks later were fed approximately 55 microgram vitamin D/d, as vitamin D3, in a mixture of vitamin D3 and 25-hydroxyvitamin D3, or 25-hydroxyvitamin D3. The end-points measured were plasma 25-hydroxyvitamin D3, and in the liver and loin the content of vitamin D3 and 25-hydroxyvitamin D3. Vitamin D3 and 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 in the feed did not affect 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 in the plasma, liver or loin differently, while a significant effect was shown on vitamin D3 in the liver and loin (P<0.001). 25-Hydroxyvitamin D3 in the plasma, liver and loin significantly correlates with the sum of vitamin D3 and 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 in the feed (P<0.05). Therefore, 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 should be regarded as having the same activity as vitamin D3 in food databases. Sole use of 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 as a vitamin D source in pig feed will produce liver and meat with a negligible content of vitamin D3, while an increased content of vitamin D3 in the feed will produce liver and meat with increased content of both vitamin D3 and 25-hydroxyvitamin D3. 3a25-hydroxycholecalciferol 3anutritional status 3aswine 3aanimal models 3apork 3avitamin content 3ameat quality 3adietary supplements 2aAgingxmetabolism 2aAnimal Feedxanalysis 2aAnimal Nutritional Physiological Phenomenaxphysiology 2aAnimals 2aBody Weight 2aCalcifediolxadministration & dosagexanalysisxpharmacokinetics. 2aCholecalciferolxadministration & dosagexanalysisxpharmacokinetics. 2aLiverxmetabolism 2aMeatxanalysis 2aModels, Animal 2aSubcutaneous Fatxchemistry 2aSus scrofa 2aVitamin Dxanalysis1 aMaribo, H.1 aBysted, A.1 aSommer, H.M.1 aHels, O.0 tBritish journal of nutrition.g2007 Nov., v. 98, no. 5 p.908-913x0007-11457nnas  aDNAL  a20080428b20080502c00000000  aINDd3CTe2008/04/04  aNon-US 7aarticle01270naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001500110245007400125300001600199500001500215520033400230650001000564650001800574650002200592650001500614650003600629650000900665650002700674651001300701653001400714653002300728700001900751773007200770852000900842930003300851945001300884946001100897655001200908IND2051190820221120032133.0960509e199602  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205119082DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShaari, K.10aD:A-friedo-oleanane triterpenes from the stem of Homalium longifolium  ap. 867-869.  a2019-12-05  aTwo D:A-friedo-oleanane triterpenes have been isolated from the stems of Homalium longifolium.

In sampling across this sequence in Pucallpa, Peru, 235 plant species were recorded in the forest, of which 143 were not found in any successive land use. However, plants not occurring in the forest colonized fields and fallow. In total, 595 species were identified across treatments. Changes in communities generally reflected the replacement of shade-tolerant plants, with seed dispersed by bats, other mammals, ants, and larger birds, and by pioneer plants adapted to open conditions and producing larger numbers of small seed, dispersed by smaller birds and the wind. Each form of land use hosted 7-25% of the original forest species, plus 13-66 plant species adapted to that land use. As field conditions changed over time, different sets of more competitive weeds emerged. As a response, farmers changed crops, fallowed fields, and cleared more forest. Farmers were most concerned about Rottboellia cochinchinensis (Lour.) Clayton in fields after fallow, and Imperata brasiliensis Trin., an indicator of land degradation. Older fallow was similar to forest in many respects, although species composition differed. Farmers named useful species across treatments, but counts of these were very low, suggesting high human intervention in the forest and heavy pressure on such species in all land uses. 3achronosequences 3apioneer species 3aplant communities 3afields 3abotanical composition 3ashifting cultivation 3afallow 3ashade 3aweeds 3aecosystems 3adegradation 3aland use 3aseed dispersal 3aforests 3aPeru 0atolerance 0acompetitive ability 0ainteractions 0aplant colonization 0aspecies diversity 0avegetation1 aEscobar, G.1 aVeneklaas, E.J.0 tAgriculture, ecosystems & environment.g2000 Apr., v. 78, no. 2 p.175-186x0167-88097nnas  aDNAL  a20001231b20010109c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US 7aarticle02704naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003200111040001800143100002200161245008000183300001800263500002400281520137400305650004101679650001901720650002201739650001501761650006801776650002001844650004101864650003101905650001301936650001601949650001701965700001901982700002202001700001902023700002202042700001802064773010902082852000902191856008202200655001202282IND4404383420221117180612.0080412s2008    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440438342DNAL7 a183816842pmid7 a10.1002/jssc.2007005772doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRubiolo, Patrizia10aFast-GC-conventional quadrupole mass spectrometry in essential oil analysis  ap. 1074-1084.  aIncludes references  aThis study reports on the compatibility of a conventional quadrupole MS (qMS) as detector for Fast-GC in terms of separation, identification, and quantitation when applied to the analysis of peppermint essential oil (e.o.), adopted as representative of this field. The influence of Fast-GC carried out on a 10 mx0.1 mm id narrow bore column with temperature programmes from 20 to 60°C/min on the results of a qMS in total ion chromatograms (TIC) at different speeds (from 999 and 11 111 amu/s) and SIM modes was evaluated on ten differently abundant components characterizing peppermint e.o. Separation measure (S), peak capacity (n), and half height peak width were taken as separation parameters; match quality, number of scans per peak (NP), spectral skewing, and TIC area repeatability were used for identification. Quantitation was in SIM mode and NP, dwell time, SIM area repeatability and calibration curves, LOD, and LOQ of the selected components were measured. The results show that the peppermint e.o. markers can successfully be analysed qualitatively and quantitatively by F-GC-qMS up to temperature programmes of 60°/min provided that a suitable scan speed is applied. Fast-GC-qMS reduces analysis time by a factor greater than ten and gives results that are qualitatively reliable and quantitatively comparable to those obtained by conventional GC-qMS. 3aMentha piperita nothosubsp. piperita 3aessential oils 3amass spectrometry 2aAlgorithms 2aGas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometryxinstrumentationxmethods. 2aIonsxchemistry 2aOils, Volatilexanalysisxchemistry. 2aReproducibility of Results 2aSoftware 2aTemperature 2aTime Factors1 aLiberto, Erica1 aSgorbini, Barbara1 aRusso, Rossana1 aVeuthey, Jean-Luc1 aBicchi, Carlo0 tJournal of separation science.g2008 Apr., v. 31, no. 6-7 p.1074-1084dWiley-VCH Verlagx1615-93067nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jssc.2007005773Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02269naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127072001700144100001500161245008000176300001600256500001500272520084300287650001601130650002101146650001101167650001801178650001801196650001901214650002301233650001901256650000901275650001801284650002201302650001401324650004301338650002001381650001501401650001101416650001701427650002301444653001701467653001201484700001901496700001701515700001601532700001701548773007201565852000901637930003301646945002501679946001101704655001201715IND4370467020221117180600.0050525e200508  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437046702DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

However, efficiency of extraction strongly depends on operative conditions. In this work, the effects of three critical variables - flow-rate (between 2 and 3 ml/min), sample quantity (between 2.5 and 7.5 g) and particle size (between 0.5 and 5.5 mm) - on extraction efficiency were studied. Process conditions maximizing the antiradical activity of the phenol extract were found to be 2 ml/min flow rate, 2.5 g sample quantity and 0.5 mm particle size. In addition, extraction promoted the formation of phenolic compounds not naturally occurring in the grape residue. Chromatographic profiles of extracts confirmed that these novel compounds were formed as a consequence of phenol polymerisation. 3apolyphenols 3aplant byproducts 3agrapes 3afood analysis 3afree radicals 3apolymerization 3acontinuous systems 3aplant extracts 3aflow 3aparticle size 3anatural additives 3avarieties 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3aprocess control 3aextraction 3ayields 3aantioxidants 3afood preservatives 0aoptimization 0aphenols1 aFabbro, P. del1 aManzocco, L.1 aNunez, M.J.1 aNicoli, M.C.0 tFood chemistry.g2005 Aug., v. 92, no. 1 p.109-117x0308-81467nnas  aDNAL  a20070720b20070802c00000000  aINDd5CTe2006/01/20  aNon-US 7aarticle03762naa a2200601 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127072001700145100001100162245008000173300001800253500001500271520205700286650002302343650002402366650001502390650001202405650001502417650002002432650002602452650001102478650001302489650002202502650002602524650002402550650002502574650002002599650002702619650001802646650001202664650002702676650001802703650002402721651001002745653002402755653001602779653001402795653001502809700001202824700001302836700001302849700001302862773010802875852000902983856008502992930003303077945002503110946001303135655001203148IND4393927020221117170640.0070811s2007    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439392702DNAL7 a10.1080/001036207014354562doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aLi, H.10aImpact of Soil Management on Organic Carbon Content and Aggregate Stability  ap. 1673-1690.  a2019-12-04  aSoil cultivation influences organic carbon storage and soil structures. To evaluate the impact of different soil-management practices on soil organic carbon (SOC) pools and aggregate stability in black soils, SOC in whole soil, various size aggregates, and density-separated fractions from three long-term experiments (20 years) was examined. The three soil-management systems were grassland (GL), bare land (BL), and croplands. The croplands had two treatments: nitrogen and phosphorus fertilizer application (NP) and NP together with organic manure (NPM). The SOC in the 0- to 10-cm layer decreased in the order NPM>GL>NP>BL and also declined with the soil depth. The SOC of GL increased by 9.7% as compared to NP after 20 years of natural vegetation restoration. The SOC of NPM increased by 11% over NP after 13 years of organic manure application. The percentages of water-stable aggregate (>0.25 mm) (WSA(>0.25mm)) decreased in the order GL>BL>NPM>NP in the top 0- to 20-cm horizon. WSA(>2mm), the most important fraction for carbon (C) storage in GL and NPM, accounted for 33 and 45% of the whole soil for GL in the depths of 0-10 and 10-20 cm, respectively, and 25 and 18% for NPM in the same soil layers. A significant positive correlation was found between the C stored in WSA(>2mm) and total SOC (r=0.81, P<0.05) and between the mean weight diameters (MWD) of aggregates and total SOC (r=0.78, P<0.05). Water-stable aggregate(0.25-2mm) was the largest fraction of WSA(>0.25mm), ranging from 54 to 72% for the 0- to 10-cm layer and 46 to 71% for the 10- to 20-cm layer; thus these aggregates would play a major role in soil sustainability as well as the resistance to soil erosion. The organic carbon (OC) of heavy fraction (HF) accounted for 94-99% of the OC in the WSA(0.25-2mm), whereas free particulate organic matter (fPOM) and occluded particulate organic matter (oPOM) contributed a minor fraction of the OC in the WSA(0.25-2mm), suggesting that C sequestration in HF could enhance the stability of aggregates and C pools in black soil. 3aagricultural soils 3asoil organic carbon 3asoil depth 3adensity 3agrasslands 3asoil aggregates 3along term experiments 3aweight 3adiameter 3aagricultural land 3abotanical composition 3aorganic fertilizers 3anitrogen fertilizers 3agrassland soils 3aimmobilization in soil 3afractionation 3atillage 3aphosphorus fertilizers 3aparticle size 3aaggregate stability 3aChina 0asoil organic matter 0ablack soils 0abare land 0avegetation1 aHan, X.1 aWang, F.1 aQiao, Y.1 aXing, B.0 tCommunications in soil science and plant analysis.g2007, v. 38, no. 13-14 p.1673-1690x0010-36247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/001036207014354563Available from publisher's Web site  a20070829b20070902c00000000  aINDd2CTe2007/08/17  aOther US 7aarticle02251naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003200092040001800124100001600142245012400158300001800282500002400300520120200324650001501526650001201541650000901553650001201562650002001574650002301594650001201617650001201629650003101641650001101672700001801683773010901701852000901810856008201819655001201901IND4404383720221117170739.0080412s2008    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440438372DNAL7 a10.1002/jssc.2007005312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPal, Raktim14aThe effect of cold trap adsorbents on the gas chromatographic analysis of ambient VOCs under Peltier cooling conditions  ap. 1100-1109.  aIncludes references  aIn this work, the relative analytical performance of the GC-based detection method was investigated with a major focus on cold trap (CT) adsorbent materials against four aromatic volatile organic compounds (VOCs) (e. g., benzene, toluene, xylene, and styrene). A series of calibration experiments were hence conducted under cryofocusing conditions formed by the Peltier cooling system in a thermal desorber (TD) unit. During the course of this study, comparative calibration datasets were acquired for each of the three CT types: (i) CT (I) = Carbopack B + Carbopack C, (ii) CT (II) = Carbopack B + Carboxen 1000, and (iii) CT (III) = Tenax TA. All calibration datasets were obtained under subambient temperature (-10°C) conditions controlled by the Peltier cooling system. The reliability of the calibration data was also assessed in an ancillary experiment with the aid of the modified injection through a thermal desorber (MITD) method. The results demonstrated that the GC detection properties of different VOCs were not altered significantly between different CT applications under Peltier conditions, although relative sensitivity could be distinguished moderately depending on the CT type. 3aadsorbents 3abenzene 3acold 3acooling 3adata collection 3agas chromatography 3astyrene 3atoluene 3avolatile organic compounds 3axylene1 aKim, Ki Hyun.0 tJournal of separation science.g2008 Apr., v. 31, no. 6-7 p.1100-1109dWiley-VCH Verlagx1615-93067nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jssc.2007005313Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02956naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127072001700145072001700162072001700179100001900196245008500215300001800300500001500318520138800333650002301721650001401744650001701758650002001775650001301795650002401808650002601832650002101858650001101879650001401890650001401904650001301918650002201931650002201953650002801975650000902003650002502012651001402037653001502051653002802066700001802094700001702112773010802129852000902237856008502246930003302331945002502364946001302389655001202402IND4393929120141224000000.0070811s2007    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439392912DNAL7 a10.1080/001036207013772782doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aGiménez, P.I.10aComparative Growth of Oilseed and Textile Flax under Different Nitrogen Supplies  ap. 1425-1437.  a2019-12-04  aThe objective of this work was to compare and characterize the response to nitrogen (N) supply of a textile and an oilseed cultivar of flax (Linum usitatissimum L.). The dynamics of growth, biomass partitioning, growth rates, and leaf area evolution and duration of the cultivars Omega (oilseed) and Diane (textile) were compared under three rates of N supply. Plants were grown in pots in the field with nil (N1), 2.5 (N2), and 5 g N per pot (N3); N2 and N3 doses were divided into five applications. Shoot biomass of N2 and N3 treatments was similar in both cultivars and significantly higher than in N1. Partitioning of biomass was unaffected by N treatment but showed contrasting patterns between cultivars. The oilseed cultivar produced 30-42% more reproductive biomass and 18-30% less stem biomass than its textile counterpart. Differences between cultivars in these traits increased with increasing N rate. Maximum growth rates per plant concentrated around 1572°Cd after sowing (fructification). Faster leaf senescence after flowering contributed to the lower leaf area and leaf biomass of the textile cultivar. The availability of N at different specific moments of the plant cycle would be useful to improve the growth of organs of economic interest. Results can also provide useful information to future nutrition models and breeding programs in textile and oilseed flax. 3atemporal variation 3acultivars 3aplant growth 3aplant nutrition 3anitrogen 3aLinum usitatissimum 3anutrient availability 3afertilizer rates 3ashoots 3aleaf area 3aphenology 3agenotype 3agenetic variation 3aseed productivity 3adry matter partitioning 3aflax 3anitrogen fertilizers 3aArgentina 0asenescence 0adry matter accumulation1 aSorlino, D.M.1 aTrápani, N.0 tCommunications in soil science and plant analysis.g2007, v. 38, no. 11-12 p.1425-1437x0010-36247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/001036207013772783Available from publisher's Web site  a20070829b20070902c00000000  aINDd2CTe2007/08/17  aOther US 7aarticle01291naa a2200289 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004400092040001800136100001500154245007000169300001600239300003200255520041400287650002100701650001800722700001900740700001400759700001600773773009300789852000900882856005700891939003300948945000800981655001200989IND7907944720221123040902.0791015e197909  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND790794472DNAL7 a10.1093/oxfordjournals.aob.a0857292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShomer, I.14aThe intracellular location of catechol oxidase in the olive fruit  ap. 261-263.  ap. 261-263. ill., 2 plates.  aCatechol oxidase in young olive fruits was located on the inner face of chloroplast thylakoids and in the mitochondria.

(Hymenoptera: Apidae) during metamorphosis  ap. 169-172.  aSummary in Portuguese.  aThe electrophoretic pattern of proteins and the activity of acid phosphatase were described in the midgut extracts during the post-embryonic stages of Apis mellifera L. in order to stablish a correlation with the metamorphosis events. The results show the greatest variation in proteic electrophoretical bands during prepupal stage and the smallest variation during the brown eyed pupae stage. The acid phosphatase activity was higher during the larval last instar and lower in white eyed pupae. The greatest variety of bands during the prepupal stage coincides with the histolysis of the larval midgut epithelium and the lowest variability in the brown eyed pupa coincides with the end of the midgut differentiation. In another hand, the greatest phosphatase activity in the last larval stage must reflect this enzyme actuation in the histolysis of the larval epithelium. 3aApis mellifera 3ahoney bees 3ainsect proteins 3achemical analysis 3amidgut 3ametamorphosis 3aacid phosphatase 3aenzyme activity 3alarval development 3apupal development 3apolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis 3ainsect biochemistry1 aCruz-Landim, C. da0 tNeotropical entomology.g2004 , v. 33, no. 2 p.169-172x1519-566X7nnas  aDNAL  a20060518b20060607c00000000  aINDdRSCe2005/07/07  aNon-US 7aarticle03179naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127072001700145072001700162100001200179245012200191300001800313520152700331650002101858650001301879650001301892650001901905650002001924650002101944650001501965650002701980650001902007650002002026650001502046650001602061650001202077650002802089650001502117650001202132650001402144650002402158650002402182650001802206651001202224653002802236653001602264700001302280700001502293700002002308773010802328852000902436856008502445930003302530945002502563946001302588655001202601IND4393930420221123040842.0070811s2007    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439393042DNAL7 a10.1080/001036207013801322doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aYao, H.10aEvaluation of Dolomite Phosphate Rock-N-Viro Soil Mixtures for Growth of a Horticultural Crop in an Acidic Sandy Soil  ap. 1605-1617.  aMost agricultural soils in the Indian River area, South Florida, are sandy with minimal holding capacity for moisture and nutrients. Phosphorus (P) leaching from these soils has been suspected of contributing to the eutrophication of surface waters in this region. Dolomite phosphate rock (DPR) and N-viro soil are promising amendments to increase crop production and reduce P loss from sandy soils. Soil incubation and greenhouse pot experiments were conducted to examine the effects of Florida DPR-N-viro soil mixtures on the growth of a horticultural crop in an acidic sandy soil and to generate information for developing a desired formula of soil amendments. Dolomite phosphate rock and N-viro soil application increased soil pH, electrical conductivity (EC), extractable P, calcium (Ca), and magnesium (Mg). N-viro soil had greater effect on soil pH, organic matter content, and microbial biomass than the DPR. Comparatively higher nitrification rates were found in the N-viro soil treatment than the DPR treatment. A systematic decrease in soil-extractable P was found with increasing proportions of N-viro soil from the combined amendments. Greenhouse study demonstrated that the application of DPR and N-viro soil significantly improved dry-matter yield and increased plant P, Ca, and Mg concentrations of radish (Raphanus sativus L.). Based on dry-matter yield and plant N uptake, the combined amendments that contained 30% or 20% of DPR materials appear to be optimal but remain to be confirmed by field trials. 3aRaphanus sativus 3aradishes 3adolomite 3arock phosphate 3asoil amendments 3aapplication rate 3acrop yield 3awater holding capacity 3asoil fertility 3aplant nutrition 3aacid soils 3asandy soils 3asoil pH 3aelectrical conductivity 3aphosphorus 3acalcium 3amagnesium 3asoil organic matter 3asoil microorganisms 3anitrification 3aFlorida 0adolomite rock phosphate 0aN-viro soil1 aHe, Z.L.1 aYang, X.E.1 aStoffella, P.J.0 tCommunications in soil science and plant analysis.g2007, v. 38, no. 11-12 p.1605-1617x0010-36247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/001036207013801323Available from publisher's Web site  a20070829b20070902c00000000  aINDd2CTe2007/08/17  aOther US 7aarticle02523naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002700111040001800138100002800156245016400184300001800348500001500366520084500381650001601226650001301242650002301255650001401278650001401292650004301306650002501349650001501374650001701389650001501406650001201421650001501433650005001448650005001498650003501548650002001583650001901603650002601622650002001648653001901668653001401687700001601701700001701717773010201734852000901836856007701845930003301922945001301955946001301968655001201981IND2229930020221123040923.0010206e200004  dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND222993002DNAL7 a107753702pmid7 a10.1021/jf990655n2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRuiz del Castillo, M.L.10aDetermination of the enantiomeric composition of gamma-lactones in edible oils by on-line coupled high performance liquid chromatography and gas chromatography  ap. 1186-1190.  a2019-12-04  aA new method is proposed for the determination of the enantiomeric composition of gamma-lactones in different vegetable edible oils (i.e., olive oil, almond oil, hazelnut oil, peanut oil, and walnut oil), and its potential for authenticity control is underlined for a limited number of samples. The method is based on the direct injection (i.e., without requiring a sample pretreatment step) in on-line coupled reversed phase liquid chromatography to gas chromatography (RPLC-GC) using a chiral stationary phase in the GC-step. Different experimental values for both speed of sample introduction into GC and volume of the transferred fraction are considered to improve the recoveries obtained. Relative standard deviations lower than 10% and detection limits ranging from 0.06 to 0.22 mg/L were achieved for the investigated gamma-lactones. 3aenantiomers 3alactones 3agas chromatography 3ahazelnuts 3aolive oil 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3aadulterated products 3aalmond oil 3ahazelnut oil 3awalnut oil 3awalnuts 3apeanut oil 2aChromatography, High Pressure Liquidxmethods 2aGas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometryxmethods 2aLactonesxanalysisxchemistry. 2aNutsxchemistry 2aOnline Systems 2aPlant Oilsxchemistry 2aStereoisomerism 0aidentification 0aseed oils1 aHerraiz, M.1 aBlanch, G.P.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2000 Apr., v. 48, no. 4 p.1186-1190x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf990655n3Available from publisher's Web site  a20010301b20010313c00000000  aINDdGHK  aOther US 7aarticle02402naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127072001700145100001800162245010100180300001800281500001500299520106900314650001801383650002401401650002401425650001301449650001801462650002501480650001501505650001801520650001701538650001601555650003101571651001701602653002101619653002401640700001901664773010801683852000901791856008501800930003301885945002501918946001301943655001201956IND4393927420221123040854.0070811s2007    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439392742DNAL7 a10.1080/001036207014355062doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

However, little information has been reported related to the need for and effects of grinding soils on C analysis by high-temperature combustion. We studied the effects of grinding five glacially derived soils of varying textural composition and organic matter content to 2-mm, 1-mm, 0.5-mm, 0.25-mm, and 0.15-mm particle sizes on the measurement of total, inorganic, and organic C content using a high-temperature combustion technique. Medium-textured soils showed significantly higher total and organic C values for the 2-, 1-, and 0.5-mm particle sizes than for the 0.25- and 0.15-mm particle sizes compared to soils that were high in sand or clay. Grinding did not appear to affect inorganic C values. Grinding the soils to 0.15 mm, in all cases, greatly reduced the variability of C values by as much as two- to six-fold when compared to 2-mm soils. We recommend that soils be ground to pass a 0.15-mm (100-mesh) screen prior to C analysis by high-temperature combustion. 3aglacial soils 3asoil organic carbon 3aexperimental design 3aaccuracy 3aparticle size 3acarbon sequestration 3acombustion 3asoil sampling 3asoil texture 3atemperature 3aparticle size distribution 3aNorth Dakota 0asample treatment 0asoil organic matter1 aJacobson, K.A.0 tCommunications in soil science and plant analysis.g2007, v. 38, no. 13-14 p.1733-1739x0010-36247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/001036207014355063Available from publisher's Web site  a20070829b20070902c00000000  aINDd2CTe2007/08/17  aOther US 7aarticle03303naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002700111040001800138100001900156245006600175300001800241500001500259520164100274650001301915650001801928650001101946650001601957650001401973650002101987650001702008650002102025650002802046650002002074650001602094650002702110650002102137650002802158650001802186650002802204650001402232650003102246650002502277650001702302650005302319653001102372653002102383653001602404653001502420653001602435653001502451773010202466852000902568856007702577930003302654945001302687946001302700655001202713IND2229924420221123031348.0010206e200004  dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND222992442DNAL7 a107753642pmid7 a10.1021/jf991106k2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNaguib, Y.M.A.10aAntioxidant activities of astaxanthin and related carotenoids  ap. 1150-1154.  a2019-12-04  aThe antioxidant activities of astaxanthin and related carotenoids have been measured by employing a newly developed fluorometric assay. This assay is based on 4,4-difluoro-3,5-bis(4-phenyl-1,3-butadienyl)- 4-bora-3a,4a-diaza-s-indacene (BODIPY 665/676) as an indicator; 2,2'-azobis-2,4-dimethylvaleronitrile (AMVN) as a peroxyl radical generator; and 6-hydroxy-2,5,7,8-tetramethyl-chroman-2-carboxylic acid (Trolox) as a calibrator in an organic and liposomal media. By employing this assay, three categories of carotenoids were examined: namely, the hydrocarbon carotenoids lycopene, alpha-carotene, and beta-carotene; the hydroxy carotenoid lutein; and the alpha-hydroxy-ketocarotenoid astaxanthin. The relative peroxyl radical scavenging activities of Trolox, astaxanthin, alpha-tocopherol, lycopene, beta-carotene, lutein, and alpha-carotene in octane/butyronitrile (9:1, v/v) were determined to be 1.0, 1.0, 1.3, 0.5, 0.4, 0.3, and 0.2, respectively. In dioleoylphosphatidyl choline (DOPC) liposomal suspension in Tri-HCl buffer (pH 7.4 at 40 degrees C), the relative reactivities of astaxanthin, beta-carotene, alpha-tocopherol, and lutein were found to be 1.00, 0.9, 0.6,and 0.6, respectively. When BODIPY 665/676 was replaced by 4,4-difluoro-5-(4-phenyl-1,3-butadienyl) -4-bora-3a,4a-diaza-s-indacene-3-undecanoic acid (BODIPY 581/591 C11) as an indicator, astaxanthin showed the highest antioxidant activity toward peroxyl radicals. The relative reactivities of Trolox, astaxanthin, alpha-tocopherol, alpha-carotene, lutein, beta-carotene, and lycopene were determined to be 1.0, 1.3, 0.9, 0.5, 0.4, 0.2, and 0.4, respectively. 3anitriles 3afree radicals 3aassays 3aastaxanthin 3aoxidation 3afluorescent dyes 3aantioxidants 3acarboxylic acids 2aAntioxidantsxchemistry 2aBoron Compounds 2aCalibration 2aCarotenoidsxchemistry 2aFluorescent Dyes 2aFree Radical Scavengers 2aFree Radicals 2aIndicators and Reagents 2aPeroxides 2aSpectrometry, Fluorescence 2aVitamin Exchemistry 2aXanthophylls 2abeta Carotenexanalogs & derivativesxchemistry. 0atrolox 0aperoxyl radicals 0afluorimetry 0aindicators 0acarotenoids 0ainhibition0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2000 Apr., v. 48, no. 4 p.1150-1154x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf991106k3Available from publisher's Web site  a20010301b20010313c00000000  aINDdGHK  aOther US 7aarticle01996naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127072001700144100002000161242013700181245013900318300001600457500002400473520082300497650001501320650002001335650001601355650001601371651001101387653003201398700002001430700001801450773007601468852000901544930003301553945002501586946001101611655001201622IND4369073520221123031443.0050418e200403  xx |||||o|||||||||||por||7 aIND436907352DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Collects of complete colonies of this genus and even isolated individuals, are very scarcely reported. Using a nest found in a forest area at Vicosa, Minas Gerais State, Brazil, slide cytogenetic preparations were made to determine the number and morphology of the chromosomes of this species. The diploid karyotype is 2n = 34. Nevertheless, none comparison with other karyotype was feasible because this is the first cytogenetical information available for this genus. Also, information about chromosome number and kariotype of other species of Cerapachynae are available only for four species, all belonging to be Cerapachys genus, being Asiatic or Australian. 3aFormicidae 3ainsect genetics 3achromosomes 3akaryotyping 3aBrazil 0aCylindromyrmex brasiliensis1 aDelabie, J.H.C.1 aPompolo, S.G.0 tNeotropical entomology.g2004 , v. 33, no. 2 p.267-269x1519-566X7nnas  aDNAL  a20060518b20060607c00000000  aINDdRSCe2005/07/07  aNon-US 7aarticle02487naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002700111040001800138100001600156245014500172300001800317520095300335650001301288650000901301650000901310650001601319650002801335650002601363650002301389650002201412650002301434650001301457650001401470650001201484650001101496650001201507650005001519650002801569650005901597650001001656650001001666650001201676700001601688700001801704773010201722852000901824856007701833930003301910945001301943946001301956655001201969IND2229925420221123020010.0010206e200004  dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND222992542DNAL7 a107753662pmid7 a10.1021/jf991205y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMottier, P.10aQuantitative determination of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in barbecued meat sausages by gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry  ap. 1160-1166.  aA method is described for the analysis of the 16 polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) prioritized by the USA EPA in meat sausages grilled under common barbecue practices.

Comparison of estimates when either 1, 5, or 16 perdeuterated PAHs were used as IS showed that the most accurate determination of PAHs required that each compound be quantified against its corresponding perdeuterated analogue. 3asausages 3apork 3abeef 3aturkey meat 3apolycyclic hydrocarbons 3aaromatic hydrocarbons 3agas chromatography 3amass spectrometry 3afood contamination 3agrilling 3alamb meat 2aAnimals 2aCattle 2aCooking 2aGas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometryxmethods 2aMeat Productsxanalysis 2aPolycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbonsxanalysisxchemistry. 2aSheep 2aSwine 2aTurkeys1 aParisod, V.1 aTuresky, R.J.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2000 Apr., v. 48, no. 4 p.1160-1166x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf991205y3Available from publisher's Web site  a20010301b20010313c00000000  aINDdGHK  aOther US 7aarticle01544naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127072001700144100001300161245010100174300001600275500002700291500001500318520039100333650002200724650001600746650001900762650001600781650001900797650002000816650001400836651001100850653003000861653001500891700002000906700001300926700001700939773007600956852000901032930003301041945002501074946001101099655001201110IND4364272320221123015750.0040903e200405  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436427232DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

However, the scarce studies carried out with species disagree in relation to its geographic distribution. In this note we describe the occurrence of A. robusta in the "restingas" of Guriri Island, north of Espirito Santo State. This occurrence makes clear that A. robusta is not endemic from Rio de Janeiro State, being distributed at least in "restingas" in Rio de Janeiro and Espirito Santo states. 3aindigenous species 3aAtta 3aleaf-cutting ants 3azoogeography 3aBrazil 0aAtta robusta1 aSchoereder, J.H.1 aLouzada, J.N.C.0 tNeotropical entomology.g2004 , v. 33, no. 2 p.265-266x1519-566X7nnas  aDNAL  a20060518b20060607c00000000  aINDdRSCe2005/07/07  aNon-US 7aarticle02220naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127072001700144072001700161100001800178245011900196300001600315500002700331500001500358520060100373650001800974650001800992650001701010650002501027650001701052650003001069650001501099650001501114650001601129650002701145650001301172650001401185650001701199650001201216650001701228653002601245653002301271653002701294653002201321653002301343653001901366653002601385653001501411653002401426653002601450773007601476852000901552930003301561945002501594946001101619655001201630IND4366908120221122235224.0050203e200411  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436690812DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Until recently a more landscape-level view of biodiversity has prevailed. This essay proposes to discuss natural diversity in ways that embrace the extreme richness inherent in plant animal interactions, including not only trophic relationships, but also aspects of life history, biology, and behavior of related species. The ant-plant-herbivore systems in Cerrado vegetation are pointed out as good model for gaining a better understanding of "interaction biodiversity". 3aMalpighiaceae 3aMacrodactylus 3ainsect pests 3aphytophagous insects 3aVochysiaceae 3abiological control agents 3aFormicidae 3aSchefflera 3aplant pests 3aplant-insect relations 3asavannas 3amutualism 3abiodiversity 3acerrado 3aThysanoptera 0aMacrodactylus pumilio 0aliterature reviews 0aHeterothripes peixotoa 0aQualea multiflora 0aPeixotoa tomentosa 0ainsect ecology 0atrophic relationships 0aherbivores 0aDidymopanax vinosum 0aconditional mutualism0 tNeotropical entomology.g2004 , v. 33, no. 6 p.665-672x1519-566X7nnas  aDNAL  a20080321b20080404c00000000  aINDdRSCe2005/02/28  aNon-US 7aarticle04116naa a2200697 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002400164245014200188300001800330500002400348500001500372520203000387650000902417650002702426650002202453650001102475650001002486650001102496650001002507650001502517650002502532650003402557650001002591650003802601650001002639650001002649650002202659650001202681650006202693650002202755650001102777650001302788650002202801650003702823650004202860650003802902650001202940650002102952650001002973650001102983650002702994651001003021651001003031653002803041700001703069700002203086700002503108700002303133700001903156700001803175700002103193773009803214852000903312856008503321655001203406IND4404352020221122231327.0080412s2008    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440435202DNAL7 a182973102pmid7 a10.1007/s00436-008-0914-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMuturi, Ephantus J.10aBlood-feeding patterns of Culex quinquefasciatus and other culicines and implications for disease transmission in Mwea rice scheme, Kenya  ap. 1329-1335.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aStudies were conducted in Mwea Rice Scheme, Kenya during the period April 2005 and January 2007 to determine the host-feeding pattern of culicine mosquitoes. Mosquitoes were collected indoors and outdoors and tested for human, bovine, goat, and donkey blood meals by an Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay. A total of 1,714 blood-engorged samples comprising Culex quinquefasciatus Say (96.1%), Culex annulioris Theobald (1.8%), Culex poicilipes Theobald (0.9%), Aedes cuminsi Theobald (1.0%), Aedes taylori Edwards (0.1%), and Mansonia africana Theobald (0.1%) were tested. Except for A. taylori, in which the single blood meal tested was of bovine origin, the other species fed mostly on both bovine (range 73.3-100%) and goats (range 50-100%). Donkeys were also common hosts for all species (range 19.4-23.5%) except A. taylori and M. africana. C. quinquefasciatus was the only species containing human blood meals (0.04), and indoor collected populations of this species had significantly higher frequency of human blood meals (9.8%) compared with outdoor-collected populations (3.0%). Mixed blood feeding was dominant among culicine species comprising 50.0%, 73.3%, 73.5%, 80.6%, and 94.1% of the samples for M. africana, C. poicilipes, C. quinquefasciatus, C. annulioris, and A. cuminsi, respectively. Ten mixed blood meal combinations including a mixture of all the four hosts were observed in C. quinquefasciatus, compared to one blood meal combination for M. Africana, and two combinations for C. poicilipes, C. annulioris, and A. cuminsi. Mixed bovine and goat blood meal was the most common combination among the five culicine species followed by a mixture of donkey, bovine, and goat blood meals. We conclude that culicine species in Mwea are least likely to be vectors of lymphatic filariasis due to their high “preference” for livestock over human hosts, but they present an increased risk for arbovirus transmission particularly Rift Valley Fever virus, in which domestic animals serve as amplification hosts. 3arice 3aCulex quinquefasciatus 3aMansonia africana 3ahumans 3ahosts 3acattle 3agoats 3ablood meal 3adisease transmission 3aRift Valley fever phlebovirus 3aasses 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3ablood 3aAedes 2aAedesxphysiology 2aAnimals 2aArbovirus Infectionsxradionuclide imagingxtransmission. 2aBloodximmunology 2aCattle 2aChickens 2aCulexxphysiology 2aDisease Transmission, Infectious 2aElephantiasis, Filarialxtransmission 2aEnzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay 2aEquidae 2aFeeding Behavior 2aGoats 2aHumans 2aMalvaceaexphysiology. 3aKenya 0aKenya 0aRift Valley fever virus1 aMuriu, Simon1 aShililu, Josephat1 aMwangangi, Joseph M.1 aJacob, Benjamin G.1 aMbogo, Charles1 aGithure, John1 aNovak, Robert J.0 tParasitology research.g2008 May, v. 102, no. 6 p.1329-1335dSpringer-Verlagx0932-01137nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00436-008-0914-73Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02337naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127072001700144100001700161245009400178300001600272520106000288650001601348650002001364650002701384650002201411650002701433650002801460650002901488650002001517650001801537650003301555650002601588650001801614650001801632650002001650700001901670700001901689700002101708773007201729852000901801930003301810945002501843946001101868655001201879IND4370467920221122231333.0050525e200508  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437046792DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aAbrodo, P.A.10aFatty acid composition of cider obtained either by traditional or controlled fermentation  ap. 183-187.  aA pilot-scale model for controlled fermentation in cider-making is described. This technology is compared with the conventional induction of alcoholic fermentation and spontaneous malolactic conversion on the basis of the cider's fatty acid profile. Controlled cider fermentations were carried out by means of sequential inoculation of Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Leuconostoc oenos. It was observed that there are significant differences in fatty acid composition depending on the fermentation process employed. The contents in fatty acids of ciders elaborated by a conventional process were higher than those of ciders obtained by controlled fermentation. The use of principal component analysis (PCA), linear discriminant analysis (LDA), soft independent modeling of class analogy (SIMCA) and partial least squares (PLS) in conjunction with the fatty acid composition allowed the authors to typify fermented apple products on the basis of the fermented technology. The most relevant variables for classification purposes were lauric and palmitic acids. 3aapple cider 3afermented foods 3afatty acid composition 3afruit composition 3aalcoholic fermentation 3amalolactic fermentation 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3aOenococcus oeni 3alipid content 3aprincipal component analysis 3adiscriminant analysis 3aleast squares 3apalmitic acid 3adodecanoic acid1 aCabrales, I.M.1 aAlonso, J.J.M.1 aBlanco-Gomis, D.0 tFood chemistry.g2005 Aug., v. 92, no. 1 p.183-187x0308-81467nnas  aDNAL  a20070720b20070802c00000000  aINDd5CTe2006/01/20  aNon-US 7aarticle02123naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127072001700145072001700162072001700179100001700196245009000213300001800303520077700321650001501098650002001113650002201133650002501155650001701180650001701197650002001214650003101234650002101265650001301286650002301299650001601322700001801338700001801356700001801374773010801392852000901500856008501509930003301594945002501627946001301652655001201665IND4396086720221122231518.0071016s2007    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439608672DNAL7 a10.1080/001036207015490252doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aKongchum, M.10aEffect of Straw Incorporation on 15N-Labeled Ammonium Nitrogen Uptake and Rice Growth  ap. 2149-2161.  aA greenhouse experiment was conducted to determine the effect of rice straw residue on growth and uptake of added 15N-labeled ammonium nitrogen (NH4-N) (3% 15N abundance at the rate of 150 kg N ha(-)) by rice in Crowley silt loam soil (Typic Albaqualfs). Higher rates of rice straw addition had an adverse affect on plant growth from the first to sixth week. After 6 weeks, the high rice straw treatment had a positive effect on plant growth (P < 0.05). The 15N-labeled ammonium or fertilizer nitrogen (N) uptake by rice was significantly lower (P < 0.05) in the high rice straw treatment as compared to lower rice straw treatments. Greater plant growth was recorded under alternate flooding and draining condition as compared to continuously flooded treatment (P < 0.01). 3arice straw 3anutrient uptake 3aammonium nitrogen 3anitrogen fertilizers 3aOryza sativa 3aplant growth 3asilt loam soils 3agreenhouse experimentation 3aisotope labeling 3anitrogen 3asoil water regimes 3agrain yield1 aDeLaune, R.D.1 aHudnall, W.H.1 aBollich, P.K.0 tCommunications in soil science and plant analysis.g2007, v. 38, no. 15-16 p.2149-2161x0010-36247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/001036207015490253Available from publisher's Web site  a20080325b20080404c00000000  aINDdLYNe2007/10/25  aOther US 7aarticle01408naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001400110245006100124300001800185500001500203520035100218650001400569650001700583650002200600650003600622650002700658651001000685653001700695653001500712653001700727653001700744653001500761653002300776700002100799700001600820700002200836773007400858852000900932930003300941945001300974946001100987655001200998IND2051110120221122231549.0960503e199603  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205111012DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aReina, M.10aFive diterpenoid alkaloids from Delphinium cardiopetalum  ap. 1235-1250.  a2019-12-05  aA further study of the alkaloidal constituents of Delphinium cardiopetalum led to the isolation of five new highly functionalized diterpenoid alkaloids, cardiopine, cardiopinine, cardiopimine, cardiopidine and cardiodine.

The soils used in this experiment were sampled from six different regions of south India. The physicochemical properties, urea hydrolysis as influenced by soil pH, incubation period, and nitrification inhibitor were determined. There was a strong positive correlation between urease activity and organic-matter content of tea soils, whereas physicochemical properties failed to show any relationship with urease activity. The urease activity was highest in Munnar soils. At 25 degrees C, the activity reached maximum within 15 days after fertilizer application, and it was considerably high up to 36 days in the soils of Anamallais, 18 days in Munnar, and 27 days in other zones studied, which revealed the minimum interval between two successive urea fertilizer applications. Soils of different zones showed a different pattern of urease activity when the soil pH was changed artificially between 4 and 5.5. Addition of nitrification inhibitor dicyandiamide, DCD to urea prevented nitrate ion formation, resulting in the accumulation of desirable ammonium ions. 3ageographical distribution 3atea 3aagricultural soils 3asoil organic matter 3afertilizer application 3anitrification 3adicyandiamide 3asoil physical properties 3aduration 3aurea 3ahydrolysis 3asoil pH 3aurease 3aenzyme activity 3aclimatic zones 3aIndia 0asoil chemical properties1 aSudhahar, V.1 aSenthurpandian, V.K.1 aMurugesan, S.0 tCommunications in soil science and plant analysis.g2007, v. 38, no. 17-18 p.2295-2307x0010-36247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/001036207015884113Available from publisher's Web site  a20080325b20080404c00000000  aINDdLYNe2007/11/26  aOther US 7aarticle02081naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100002300128245009400151300001600245500001500261520056100276650001800837650001800855650002200873650001500895650002300910650002500933650002000958650001700978650001200995650002301007650003301030650003401063650003601097650001101133650002701144650002601171650003201197650000901229650003101238650002101269653002201290653002101312653002101333653002001354700001901374773007801393852000901471930003301480945001301513946001301526655001201539IND2054328520221122214610.0961205e199510  tnu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205432852DNAL7 a85691562pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPrado, J.C. do Jr.10aNormal hematologic values of various age groups of Calomys callosus (Rodentia Cricetidae)  ap. 558-560.  a2019-12-05  aHematologic values for Calomys calosus, a wild rodent, were established.

The aim of our study was to determine the frequency and correlates of hypoalbuminemia in unselected cohort of patients with acute cerebral infarction. Design: Prospective study. Setting: University hospital. Subjects: Seven hundred and five consecutive ischemic stroke patients. Methods: Albumin and other serum protein fractions were measured within 36 h after stroke using electrophoresis. Results: Hypoalbuminemia defined as serum albumin level <35 g/l was found in 45.5% of patients. Serum albumin level correlates significantly with age (r=-0.13, P<0.01), Scandinavian Stroke Scale score (r=0.14, P<0.01), body temperature on admission (r=0.14, P<0.01), leukocyte count (r=-0.17, P<0.01), fasting glucose (r=-0.16, P<0.01), total cholesterol (r=0.14, P<0.01), 1-globulin (r=-0.48, P<0.01), 2-globulin (r=-0.49, P<0.01), -globulin (r=-0.26, P<0.01) and -globulin (r=-0.35, P<0.01).Conclusions: Hypoalbuminemia is a frequent finding in acute stroke patients and it is associated with more severe stroke and pro-inflammatory pattern of serum protein electrophoresis. 3aischemia 3aserum albumin 3amorbidity 3adisease prevalence 3ablood glucose 3arisk factors 3aage 3abody temperature 3acholesterol 3astroke 3apatients 3aleukocyte count 3aglobulins 3amortality 3adisease incidence 2aAcute Disease 2aAdult 2aAge Factors 2aAged 2aAged, 80 and over 2aBlood Glucosexmetabolism 2aBlood Protein Electrophoresisxmethods 2aBlood Proteinsxanalysis 2aBody Temperature 2aCerebral Infarctionxbloodxpathology. 2aCholesterolxblood 2aCohort Studies 2aFemale 2aHumans 2aHypoalbuminemiaxepidemiologyxpathology. 2aLeukocyte Count 2aMale 2aMiddle Aged 2aProspective Studies 2aSerum Albuminxmetabolism 2aSeverity of Illness Index 0ahypoalbuminemia 0ablood proteins 0aScandanavian Stroke Scale score 0aalbuminuria1 aPera, J.1 aSlowik, A.1 aGryz-Kurek, E.A.1 aSzczudlik, A.0 tEuropean journal of clinical nutrition.g2007 Nov., v. 61, no. 11 p.1318-1322x0954-30077nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1038/sj.ejcn.16026433Available from publisher's Web site  a20080415b20080502c00000000  aINDd6CTe2008/03/14  aNon-US  mNon-PubAg articles 7aarticle02496naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127072001700145100001800162245006200180300001800242500001500260520125300275650003201528650001601560650002201576650002001598650002701618650002401645650001901669650002801688653001601716653001501732700001401747700002101761700001901782773010801801852000901909856008501918930003302003945002502036946001302061655001202074IND4397623220221122214629.0071108s2007    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439762322DNAL7 a10.1080/001036207015888252doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aMcBeath, T.M.10aPolyphosphate Speciation for Soil and Fertilizer Analysis  ap. 2445-2460.  a2019-12-04  aAmmonium polyphosphate fertilizers provide an analytical challenge because they contain mixed phosphorus (P) species in solution as orthophosphate, pyrophosphate, and tripolyphosphate species. The conventional technique for the determination of polyphosphate concentration in solution is measuring the difference between total digested P and initial orthophosphate with colorimetry. Online colorimetry was compared with ion chromatography as a method for the speciation and quantification of the chemical species of P supplied in polyphosphate fertilizers. Ion chromatography was able to speciate all of the P species supplied in polyphosphate fertilizer, whereas colorimetry detected only P in solution as orthophosphate and, by the difference between the measurement of digested and undigested samples, total condensed P species. Ion chromatography had a detection limit of 0.02 mg P L(-1) for orthophosphate, 0.03 mg P L(-1) for pyrophosphate, and 0.05 mg P L(-1) for tripolyphosphate. The detection limit for orthophosphate measured by colorimetry was the same as that measured by chromatography, but the working range of concentrations was considerably greater for chromatography-from 0.02 to 200 mg P L(-1) compared with 0.02 to 2 mg P L(-1). 3aion exchange chromatography 3acolorimetry 3atripolyphosphates 3aorthophosphates 3aphosphorus fertilizers 3achemical speciation 3apyrophosphates 3aammonium polyphosphates 0amethodology 0aphosphates1 aLombi, E.1 aMcLaughlin, M.J.1 aBunemann, E.K.0 tCommunications in soil science and plant analysis.g2007, v. 38, no. 17-18 p.2445-2460x0010-36247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/001036207015888253Available from publisher's Web site  a20080325b20080404c00000000  aINDdLYNe2007/11/27  aOther US 7aarticle03079naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100002100171245008400192300001800276520147900294650001401773650001501787650002901802650001001831650001601841650000901857650001801866650001901884650003101903650002301934650001801957650001201975650004101987650001102028650002602039650004002065650002902105650003802134653003902172653001802211653003502229653001802264700002202282773011202304852000902416856009202425930003302517946001102550655001202561IND4436211220221122214630.0100430e201005  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443621122DNAL7 a204027632pmid7 a10.1111/j.1742-4658.2010.07640.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKataoka, Hiroaki10aHepatocyte growth factor activator (HGFA): pathophysiological functions in vivo  ap. 2230-2237.  aHepatocyte growth factor activator (HGFA) is a serine protease initially identified as a potent activator of hepatocyte growth factor/scatter factor. Hepatocyte growth factor/scatter factor is known to be critically involved in tissue morphogenesis, regeneration, and tumor progression, via its receptor, MET. In vivo, HGFA also activates macrophage-stimulating protein, which has roles in macrophage recruitment and inflammatory processes, cellular survival and wound healing through its receptor, RON. Therefore, the pericellular activity of HGFA might be an important factor regulating the activities of these multifunctional cytokines in vivo. HGFA is secreted mainly by the liver, circulates in the plasma as a zymogen (pro-HGFA), and is activated in response to tissue injury, including tumor growth. In addition, local production of pro-HGFA by epithelial, stromal or tumor cells has been reported. Although the generation of HGFA-knockout mice revealed that the role played by HGFA in normal development and physiological settings can be compensated for by other protease systems, HGFA has important roles in regeneration and initial macrophage recruitment in injured tissue in vivo. Insufficient activity of HGFA results in impaired regeneration of severely damaged mucosal epithelium, and may contribute to the progression of fibrotic lung diseases. On the other hand, deregulated excess activity of HGFA may be involved in the progression of some types of cancer. 3acytokines 3aepithelium 3ahepatocyte growth factor 3aliver 3amacrophages 3amice 3amorphogenesis 3aneoplasm cells 3arespiratory tract diseases 3aserine proteinases 3atissue repair 2aAnimals 2aHepatocyte Growth Factorxmetabolism 2aHumans 2aNeoplasmsxmetabolism 2aProto-Oncogene Proteinsxmetabolism 2aRegenerationxphysiology 2aSerine Endopeptidasesxmetabolism 0ahepatocyte growth factor activator 0aHGF activator 0amacrophage-stimulating protein 0atissue injury1 aKawaguchi, Makiko0 tFEBS journal.g2010 May, v. 277, no. 10 p.2230-2237dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx1742-464X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1742-4658.2010.07640.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20100430b20100501c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02361naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127072001700144100001500161245008600176300001600262500002700278520123600305650001501541650002501556650001701581650001601598650001901614650001701633650002301650650002501673650001901698650001601717653002101733700001601754700001501770773007601785852000901861930003301870945002501903946001101928655001201939IND4364270320221122214710.0040903e200405  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436427032DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aPeck, D.C.10aAlternative methods for rearing grass-feeding spittlebugs (Hemiptera: Cercopidae)  ap. 307-314.  aSummary in Portuguese.  aTwo methodologies for rearing grass-feeding spittlebugs are described and were evaluated with Aeneolamia varia (Fabricius) on Brachiaria ruziziensis Germ. & Evrard. To promote biological studies, a new small-scale rearing unit was developed to maintain spittlebug life stages in the greenhouse year round. This unit features a plant tray established with roots as feeding sites for nymphal development alongside an adult emergence cage with plants and oviposition substrate for egg collection. For large-scale production, an improved mass-rearing colony was designed to reduce inputs and streamline production. The major feature was a covered box with root and microclimate conditions adequate for nymphal development. Efficiency of adult production from eggs was 45.1%, yield 1002 adults/m2 per generation, nymphal development time 36.1 d, and adult emergence 70.5% in a 1-wk period. This mass-rearing method is a more effective tool for reliable and high-level production of spittlebugs for massive screening required for the evaluation of control tactics such as fungal entomopathogens and host plant resistance. The possibilities for further improving these designs and tailoring them to other spittlebug species are discussed. 3aAeneolamia 3aphytophagous insects 3ainsect pests 3aplant pests 3ainsect rearing 3amass rearing 3ainsect development 3aUrochloa ruziziensis 3aforage grasses 3ahost plants 0aAeneolamia varia1 aMorales, A.1 aCastro, U.0 tNeotropical entomology.g2004 , v. 33, no. 3 p.307-314x1519-566X7nnas  aDNAL  a20041229b00000000c00000000  aINDdRSCe2004/12/29  aNon-US 7aarticle03235naa a2200733 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003300111040001800144072001700162072001700179100001700196245007500213300001800288520103200306650001601338650001201354650002201366650002301388650001701411650002801428650002401456650003401480650001701514650001501531650001101546650001401557650002601571650003201597650001501629650001601644650002501660650006001685650007301745650001101818650001101829650001401840650005001854650000901904650001601913650002601929650001501955650003201970650001702002651001102019651002602030653001802056653002802074653003702102700001802139700001802157700001602175700001502191773009902206852000902305856008302314930003302397945002502430946001102455990002302466655001202489IND4399779320221122214646.0080108e200711  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439977932DNAL7 a172994572pmid7 a10.1038/sj.ejcn.16026852doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Nutritional data were collected using a dietitian-administered food-frequency questionnaire. ARM was classified from retinal photographs using the international classification and included neovascular age-related macular degeneration, geographic atrophy, soft indistinct drusen, soft distinct drusen associated with pigmentary abnormalities. After multivariate adjustment, high total, saturated and monounsaturated fat intake were associated with increased risk for ARM (odds ratio (OR)=4.74, P=0.007; OR=2.70, P=0.04; and OR= 3.50, P=0.03, respectively). Total polyunsaturated fatty acid was not significantly associated with ARM. Total and white fish intake was not significantly associated with ARM, but fatty fish intake (more than once a month versus less than once a month) was associated with a 60% reduction in risk for ARM (OR=0.42, P=0.01). 3adietary fat 3aelderly 3adisease incidence 3adisease prevalence 3arisk factors 3aepidemiological studies 3amathematical models 3afood frequency questionnaires 3aeye diseases 3afat intake 3aretina 3afish oils 3asaturated fatty acids 3amonounsaturated fatty acids 3afatty fish 3afood intake 2aConfidence Intervals 2aDietary Fatsxadministration & dosagexadverse effects. 2aDietary Fats, Unsaturatedxadministration & dosagexadverse effects. 2aFemale 2aHumans 2aIncidence 2aMacular Degenerationxepidemiologyxetiology. 2aMale 2aMiddle Aged 2aMultivariate Analysis 2aOdds Ratio 2aSurveys and Questionnaires. 2aRisk Factors 3aFrance 0aFrancexepidemiology. 0aPolanut study 0aage-related maculopathy 0aage-related macular degeneration1 aCarrière, I.1 aCristol, J.P.1 aLacroux, A.1 aGerber, M.0 tEuropean journal of clinical nutrition.g2007 Nov., v. 61, no. 11 p.1341-1344x0954-30077nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1038/sj.ejcn.16026853Available from publisher's Web site  a20080415b20080502c00000000  aINDd6CTe2008/03/17  aNon-US  mNon-PubAg articles 7aarticle02593naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001900152245008200171300001400253520146500267651002301732653002701755653000801782653002101790700002401811700002401835700002501859700002101884700002101905700002801926773014401954852000902098856009202107930003302199946001102232655001202243IND4436207920221122181605.0100430e201006  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443620792DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-3156.2010.02504.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMcGuire, Megan10aVital status of pre-ART and ART patients defaulting from care in rural Malawi  ap. 55-62.  aTo ascertain the outcome of pre-Antiretroviral therapy (ART) and ART patients defaulting from care and investigate reasons for defaulting. Patients defaulting from HIV care in Chiradzulu between July 2004 and September 2007 were traced at last known home address. Deaths and moves were recorded, and patients found alive were interviewed. Defaulting was defined as missed last appointment by more than 1 month among patients of unknown vital status. A total of 1637 individuals were traced (54%-88% of eligible), 981 pre-ART and 656 ART patients. Of 694 pre-ART patients found, 49% had died (51% of adults and 38% of children), a median of 47 days after defaulting, and 14% had moved away. Of 451 ART patients found, 54% had died (54% of adults and 50% of children), a median of 52 days after defaulting, and 20% had moved away. Overall, 221 patients were interviewed (90% of those found alive), 42% had worked outside the district in the previous year; 49% of pre-ART and 19% of ART patients had not disclosed their HIV status to other household members. Main reasons for defaulting were stigma (43%), care dissatisfaction (34%), improved health (28%) and for ART discontinuation, poor understanding of disease or treatment (56%) and drug side effects (42%). This study in a rural African HIV programme reveals the dynamics related to health service access and use, and it provides information to correct programme mortality estimates for adults and children. 3aSub-Saharan Africa 0aantiretroviral therapy 0aHIV 0apatient dropouts1 aMunyenyembe, Tamika1 aSzumilin, Elisabeth1 aHeinzelmann, Annette1 aLe Paih, Mickael1 aBouithy, Nenette1 aPujades-Rodríguez, Mar0 tTropical medicine & international health TM & IH.g2010 June, v. 15, no. s1 p.55-62dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx1360-22767nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-3156.2010.02504.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20100430b20100501c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02346naa a2200289 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100002400115245002400139300001600163300002400179520152500203650003101728653002501759653002401784653002701808653002401835653005601859773006801915852000901983939003301992945000802025946001102033655001202044991611005400742620221122181556.0840803e198308  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI840053242DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aReutlinger, Shlomo.14aThe Value of PL 480  ap. 246-249.  ap. 246-249. charts.  aPublic Law 480 (PL 480), Title II - Food for Peace, costs very little and accounts for approximately 40% of total US food aid and 10% of total US foreign aid. As constituted at present, the PL480, Title II program achieves far less than its potential. Under Title II, food was intended for assistance to people whose food consumption was below any reasonable standard. The law makes domestic US agricultural surpluses available to deficit countries. This made good economic sense at the time the law was enacted. Now, however, there are few surpluses. Currently, non-fat dry milk, oil, and grain are distributed under this program. Food aid is a valid instrument for aiding people when a budgeted dollar delivers more than a dollar transmitted directly. Both oil and milk can be delivered at a cost far less than the purchase price of the commodity at the local market. Because the program must pay the current market price for grain no longer in surplus, in many cases only 50 cents in purchasing power is delivered for each program dollar. At the present level of spending, 54 million people can be reasonably expected to benefit. Revision of the program to allow purchase of local grains, where economically advantageous, and increasing shipments of milk and oil, would provide assistance to 83 million people. New legislation could permit food aid programs to make better use of the tax dollar in alleviating hunger. It should not be overlooked amid the present political currents favoring economic efficiency.

The deduced amino acid sequence is homologous to mammalian oxysterol-binding protein (33.6% identical residues at homologous positions) but, in addition, predicts several structural modules that are not present in the mammalian counterpart. These comprise two ankyrin repeats as an N-terminal extension, and highly acidic clusters, poly-asparagine tracts as well as domains that constitute presumptive nuclear targeting signals interspersed in the N-terminal half of the yeast protein. The gene is transcribed constitutively at a low level from a promoter lacking an obvious TATA element. Heterozygous chromosomal deletion of the gene in a diploid yeast strain has no effect on sporulation or on germination of the four spores from one tetrad nor do haploid deletion mutants display any obvious disadvantage regarding growth behaviour or mating. 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3agenes 3anucleotide sequences 3aamino acid sequences 3asequence homology 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aAnkyrinsxgenetics 2aBase Sequence 2aCarrier Proteins 2aCloning, Molecular 2aFungal Proteinsxgenetics 2aGenes, Fungalxgenetics 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aRNA, Messengerxanalysis 2aReceptors, Steroidxgenetics 2aRestriction Mapping 2aSaccharomyces cerevisiaexgenetics 2aSaccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins 2aSequence Analysis, DNA 2aSequence Homology, Amino Acid 0amolecular sequence data 0agenbank/x74552 0aembl/x74552 0atranscription factor1 aBandlow, W.0 tBiochimica et biophysica acta = International journal of biochemistry and biophysics.g1994 Sept. 13, v. 1219, no. 1 p.205-210x0006-30027nnas  aDNAL  a19951002b19951006c00000000  aINDdLDP  aNon-US 7aarticle02234naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001900152245012400171300001600295520096700311650002501278650002101303650002001324650001601344650001001360650001301370650001201383650001901395650002201414650001601436650002001452650001501472650001401487650001301501651001101514773015401525852000901679856009201688930003301780946001101813655001201824IND4436209220221122181620.0100430e201004  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443620922DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1467-8489.2010.00487.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSeo, S.

Using micro-level decisions from around 9000 household surveys in 11 countries, we analyze the choice of land types across the landscape with a multinomial discrete choice model. The choices and future adaptation measures are analyzed as a mosaic based on the typology of Agro-Ecological Zones. The results indicate that if climate becomes hotter and drier, Africa will adapt by increasing a joint production of crops and animals, especially in the lowland savannahs. On the other hand, if climate becomes wetter, it will switch more to forests, either with crops or with both crops and livestock, especially in the mid and high elevation humid zones. Forestry will play a significant role in adaptation when a substantial increase in precipitation makes animal husbandry an unattractive alternative. 3aagroecological zones 3aanimal husbandry 3acrop management 3acrop models 3acrops 3aforestry 3aforests 3aglobal warming 3ahousehold surveys 3ahumid zones 3aland use change 3alandscapes 3alivestock 3asavannas 3aAfrica0 tAustralian journal of agricultural and resource economics.g2010 Apr., v. 54, no. 2 p.239-258dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx1364-985X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1467-8489.2010.00487.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20100430b20100501c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle01138naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245007700127300001800204500001500222520021700237650002200454650001300476650001000489650002400499650003600523650002700559651001000586653002300596700001500619700001400634773007400648852000900722930003300731945001300764946001100777655001200788IND2051109620221122181619.0960503e199603  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205110962DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFunayama, S.10a(+)-3'-O-Acetylisopteleflorine, a quinoline alkaloid from Orixa japonica  ap. 1231-1233.  a2019-12-05  aA new quinoline alkaloid, (+)-3'-O-acetylisopteleflorine, was isolated from a methanol extract of the stems of Orixa japonica.

  1 aFalcao-Rodrigues, M.M.10aThermal properties of gluten proteins of two soft wheat varieties  ap. 459-465.  aThe thermal properties of gluten proteins from two soft wheat varieties showing different rheological properties, "Amazonas" and "Sorraia", were studied by differential scanning calorimetry. Three endothermic peaks were found in all gluten proteins fractions, exception to "Amazonas" gliadins. In this case, the third endotherm is absent. Transition temperature, transition enthalpy and activation energy of the transition reaction were determined. Since gluten development is caused by the breakage and reformulation of sulphur bridges, the higher the energy needed to perform denaturation the more difficult will be the interaction between gliadins and glutenins. "Amazonas" wheat needs more energy to onset and to develop the transition. So, it is to be expected that the interactions among the protein fractions will become more difficult and consequently the gluten will appear as a weaker one. Multivariate analysis of the results indicates that the gliadin fraction seems to be the most responsible for the lower bread baking ability shown by "Amazonas" wheat. 3awheat 3awheat gluten 3athermal properties 3avarieties 3arheological properties 3adifferential scanning calorimetry 3agliadin 3atemperature 3aenthalpy 3aactivation energy 3aglutenins 3adenaturation 3abreadmaking quality 3aPortugal 0asoft wheat1 aMoldao-Martins, M.1 aBeirao-da-Costa, M.L.0 tFood chemistry.g2005 Dec., v. 93, no. 3 p.459-465x0308-81467nnas  aDNAL  a20060613b20060702c00000000  aINDd5CTe2006/01/09  aNon-US 7aarticle02656naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127100001800144245016500162300001600327500001500343520112800358650001801486650001701504650001701521650002701538650001701565650001301582650002001595650001901615650002401634650002001658650001101678650001901689650002001708650002201728650002301750650001401773650001301787650001601800653001601816653002201832653002301854653001401877653001901891700002101910700002101931773007201952852000902024930003302033945002502066946001102091655001202102IND4372100720221122143614.0050708e200512  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437210072DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Caffeic acid was added at 100 ppm while N-acetyl-cysteine at 20 ppm. Both wines were stored in open bottles at 20 degrees C, and samples were analysed using solid phase microextraction along with GC-MS analysis at 0, 1, and 2 days. No effect on the concentration of any volatile was observed as a result of adding caffeic acid or N-acetyl-cysteine in each wine. Many ethyl esters - such as hexanoate, octanoate, decanoate - and acetate esters - such as isoamyl acetate - decreased during storage of both white and red wine. Caffeic acid and N-acetyl-cysteine significantly inhibited the decline of the volatile esters. Linalool and alpha-terpineol decreased during storage of Muscat wine. Their decline was significantly inhibited by caffeic acid and N-acetyl-cysteine. Present results indicate that caffeic acid and N-acetyl-cysteine may be taken into account as potent inhibitors of the disappearance of aromatic volatile esters and terpenols in wines. 3afood analysis 3acaffeic acid 3awine quality 3asolid phase extraction 3afood storage 3alinalool 3astorage quality 3afood additives 3aoxidative stability 3aproduct testing 3aesters 3aodor compounds 3aalpha-terpineol 3amass spectrometry 3agas chromatography 3ared wines 3acysteine 3awhite wines 0aMuscat wine 0aN-acetyl-cysteine 0avolatile compounds 0aterpenols 0aXinomavro wine1 aLambropoulos, I.1 aPapadopoulou, D.0 tFood chemistry.g2005 Dec., v. 93, no. 3 p.485-492x0308-81467nnas  aDNAL  a20060613b20060702c00000000  aINDd5CTe2006/01/09  aNon-US 7aarticle03872naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002200152245011800174300001600292500002400308500001500332520264800347650001702995650001303012650001403025650001603039650002203055650000903077650001203086650002603098650001403124650002303138653001203161700002203173700002203195700001903217700002603236700002203262773010203284852000903386856005503395655001203450IND4459597820221122084953.0110701e201108  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445959782DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-2435.2011.01842.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPires, Marcelo N.10aWhy do placentas evolve? An evaluation of the life-history facilitation hypothesis in the fish genus Poeciliopsis  ap. 757-768.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  a1. The Northern Clade of the fish genus Poeciliopsis includes six closely related species, three of which lack placentas and three that have placentas but vary in the extent of post-fertilization provisioning. 2. We used this diversity to evaluate a series of hypotheses proposed in earlier publications concerning why the placenta has evolved. All hypotheses share the attribute of arguing that the placenta evolved to enhance the evolution of some other life-history trait, such as to reduce the age at maturation or to increase offspring size. We refer to these hypotheses collectively as ‘life-history facilitation hypotheses'. 3. A general way to evaluate the plausibility of such proposals is to ask whether the evolution of the placenta is predictably associated with the evolution of other components of the life history. 4. We evaluated such associations in two ways. First, we performed a multivariate analysis of life-history data for fish collected and preserved in nature. This analysis included 16 populations across all six species. Secondly, we performed a more complete quantification of the life histories of the laboratory descendents from five populations representing four species, then performed a similar multivariate analysis. The laboratory study added information about the timing of reproduction (age at maturity, frequency of reproduction). 5. Both analyses yielded similar results, which were that the evolution of increased placentation is correlated with the evolution of a smaller size at first reproduction, the production of fewer and smaller offspring per litter, but an increase in the number of litters that were developing simultaneously in the ovary (superfetation). Increased placentation is associated with progressively earlier ages at maturation and shorter intervals between the birth of successive litters of offspring. Overall, increased placentation was associated with an increase in the rate of production of offspring early in life. A peculiar attribute of placentation is that this increase in the rate of offspring production can be attained despite a simultaneous reduction in the proportional quantity of resources devoted to reproduction. 6. These trends support one of the life history facilitation hypotheses, which is that placentation facilitates earlier maturity and a higher rate of reproduction early in life. They also suggest a possible connection between the evolution of the placenta and the well-established theory of life-history evolution, since these same life history attributes are predicted to evolve in response to exposure to high extrinsic rates of adult mortality. 3alife history 3aplacenta 3aevolution 3aparturition 3aearly development 3afish 3aprogeny 3amultivariate analysis 3amortality 3aconservation areas 0aovaries1 aBassar, Ronald D.1 aMcBride, Kevin E.1 aRegus, John U.1 aGarland, Theodore Jr.1 aReznick, David N.0 tFunctional ecology.g2011 Aug., v. 25, no. 4 p.757-768dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0269-84637nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2435.2011.01842.x 7aarticle04169naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004100111040001800152072000900170100002900179245011600208300001600324500002400340520229300364650001302657650002002670650001602690650001102706650002102717650002602738650001902764650001402783650002202797650002202819650001202841650001302853650005702866650001902923650001102942650003402953650008202987650003703069650008003106650002403186650002603210651001503236651003003251700002203281700001903303773010003322852000903422856009103431930003303522945002503555946001103580655001203591IND4428632020221122084936.0091113e20091201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442863202DNAL7 a197671142pmid7 a10.1016/j.prevetmed.2009.07.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL8331 aBeltrán-Alcrudo, Daniel12aA flock-tailored early warning system for low pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI) in commercial egg laying flocks  ap. 324-332.  aIncludes references  aThe aim of this study was to develop and evaluate an early warning system (EWS) for commercial egg laying flocks to detect the subtle mortality and egg production changes that characterize low pathogenic avian influenza virus (LPAIV) infections. An EWS will create an alert when the recommended ‘trigger point' is reached or exceeded. Previously used EWSs are based on fixed alert levels, while the proposed EWS customizes the alert level to each flock. While a fixed approach may be valid for highly pathogenic diseases, it results in a lower detection probability for low pathogenic diseases. The EWS was based on daily data collected from flocks affected by the 2000-2004 H6N2 LPAI epidemic in California. Three EWSs were evaluated: (1) EWS1, which is triggered when the observed mortality increase or production decrease exceeds more than “x” times the expected daily value (2.75-3.50 times the expected mortality), (2) EWS2, which is triggered when the observed mortality increase or production decrease exceeds more than “y” times during each of 2 consecutive days the expected daily values (1.75-2.15 times the expected mortality), and (3) a combination of the two. The EWSs were evaluated according to three parameters: detection delay (days) of a LPAI outbreak, false alerts (%) and outbreaks missed (%). Results showed that an egg production-based EWS added no benefit to a mortality-based system, mainly because H6N2 LPAI-related egg production decrease always occurred after increase in mortality. Combining the two EWSs resulted in a reduced detection delay and no missed outbreaks, but at the expense of a slight increase in the number of false alerts triggered. The system presented in this study also outperformed fixed EWSs in all three evaluated parameters. The proposed EWS, if used as part of a poultry cooperative program and combined with a rapid laboratory diagnosis, could be a useful tool in the detection and control of LPAI outbreaks and other poultry diseases. Built in a spreadsheet, the system could be inexpensively, easily and quickly incorporated into a commercial egg production farm decision support system. In addition, the proposed system could be quickly adjusted to changing epidemic situations, and easily customized to individual flocks. 3achickens 3aavian influenza 3aoviposition 3aflocks 3acommercial farms 3aearly warning systems 3aegg production 3amortality 3adisease outbreaks 3adisease detection 2aAnimals 2aChickens 2aDisease Outbreaksxprevention & controlxveterinary. 2aEggsxvirology 2aFemale 2aInfluenza A virusximmunology 2aInfluenza in Birdsxepidemiologyximmunologyxprevention & controlxvirology. 2aPopulation Surveillancexmethods 2aPoultry Diseasesxepidemiologyximmunologyxprevention & controlxvirology. 2aRegression Analysis 2aRetrospective Studies 3aCalifornia 0aCaliforniaxepidemiology.1 aCarpenter, Tim E.1 aCardona, Carol0 tPreventive veterinary medicine.g2009 Dec. 1, v. 92, no. 4 p.324-332dElsevierx0167-58777nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.prevetmed.2009.07.0133Available from publisher's Web site  a20100107b20100205c00000000  aINDd6CTe2009/12/21  aNon-US 7aarticle02654naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004100111040001800152072000900170072000900179100002600188245008300214300001600297500002400313500001500337520101600352650002301368650001101391650001101402650001701413650001401430650002701444650001401471650002401485650002001509650001701529650001201546650001101558650005001569650002101619650001501640650005101655651001801706651003301724653002601757653002001783700002801803773010001831852000901931856009101940930003302031945002502064946001102089655001202100IND4428632420221122061600.0091113e20091201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442863242DNAL7 a197620992pmid7 a10.1016/j.prevetmed.2009.08.0222doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL832 0aX1001 aBrooks-Pollock, Ellen10aHerd size and bovine tuberculosis persistence in cattle farms in Great Britain  ap. 360-365.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aBovine tuberculosis (bTB) infection in cattle is one of the most complex and persistent problems faced by the cattle industry in Great Britain today. While a number of factors have been identified as increasing the risk of infection, there has been little analysis on the causes of persistent infection within farms. In this article, we use the Cattle Tracing System to examine changes in herd size and VetNet data to correlate herd size with clearance of bTB. We find that the number of active farms fell by 16.3% between 2002 and 2007. The average farm size increased by 17.9% between 2002 and 2005. Using a measure similar to the Critical Community Size, the VetNet data reveal that herd size is positively correlated with disease persistence. Since economic policy and subsidies have been shown to influence farm size, we used a simple financial model for ideal farm size which includes disease burden to conclude that increasing herd size for efficiency gains may contribute to increased disease incidence. 3adisease prevalence 3acattle 3amodels 3arisk factors 3aherd size 3aagricultural subsidies 3afarm size 3abovine tuberculosis 3aeconomic policy 3atraceability 2aAnimals 2aCattle 2aDisease Reservoirsxmicrobiologyxveterinary. 2aModels, Economic 2aPrevalence 2aTuberculosis, Bovinexeconomicsxepidemiology. 3aGreat Britain 0aGreat Britainxepidemiology. 0aCattle Tracing System 0acattle diseases1 aKeeling, Matthew James.0 tPreventive veterinary medicine.g2009 Dec. 1, v. 92, no. 4 p.360-365dElsevierx0167-58777nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.prevetmed.2009.08.0223Available from publisher's Web site  a20100108b20100205c00000000  aINDd6CTe2009/12/22  aNon-US 7aarticle03347naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002800111040001800139100002200157245010400179300001600283500002400299520158400323650001501907650000901922650001801931650001101949650001501960650002001975650001701995650002102012650001302033650001002046650001202056650002102068650001402089650004102103650002402144650005402168650004802222650002702270650004802297650003802345650002002383650004002403650003902443650004002482650003602522700002102558700002102579773010602600852000902706856007802715655001202793IND4382224920221122061501.0060723e200607  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438222492DNAL7 a167602182pmid7 a10.1093/pcp/pcj0682doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDuncan, Kateri A.14aThe Three Maize Sucrose Synthase Isoforms Differ in Distribution, Localization, and Phosphorylation  ap. 959-971.  aIncludes references  aAlthough sucrose synthase (SUS) is widely appreciated for its role in plant metabolism and growth, very little is known about the contribution of each of the SUS isoforms to these processes. Using isoform-specific antibodies, we evaluated the three known isoforms individually at the protein level. SUS1 and SUS-SH1 proteins have been studied previously; however, SUS2 (previously known as SUS3) has only been studied at the transcript level. Using SUS2 isoform-specific antibodies, we determined that this isoform is present in several maize tissues. The intracellular localization of all SUS isoforms was studied by cellular fractionation of leaves and developing kernels. Interestingly, SUS1 and SUS-SH1 were associated with membranes while SUS2 was not. The lack of membrane-associated SUS2 indicates that it might have a unique role in cytoplasmic sucrose metabolism. Using co-immunoprecipitation with kernel extracts, it was also established that SUS2 exists predominantly as a hetero-oligomer with SUS1, while SUS-SH1 forms only homo-oligomers. Using sequence-specific and phospho-specific antibodies, we have established for the first time that SUS-SH1 is phosphorylated in vivo at the Ser10 site in kernels, similar to the SUS1 Ser15 site. In midveins, additional evidence suggests that SUS can be phosphorylated at a novel C-terminal threonine site. Together, these results show that the isoforms of SUS are important in both cytosolic and membrane-associated sucrose degradation, but that their unique attributes most probably impart isoform-specific functional roles. 3aantibodies 3acorn 3afractionation 3aleaves 3ametabolism 3aphosphorylation 3aplant growth 3aprotein isoforms 3aproteins 3aseeds 3asucrose 3asucrose synthase 3athreonine 2aCell Membranexenzymologyxgenetics. 2aCytosolxenzymology 2aGene Expression Regulation, Enzymologicxgenetics 2aGene Expression Regulation, Plantxgenetics 2aGenes, Plantxgenetics 2aGlucosyltransferasesxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aIsoenzymesxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aPhosphorylation 2aPlant Leavesxenzymologyxgenetics. 2aPlant Rootsxenzymologyxgenetics. 2aPlant Shootsxenzymologyxgenetics. 2aZea maysxenzymologyxgenetics.1 aHardin, Shane C.1 aHuber, Steven C.0 tPlant & cell physiology.g2006 July, v. 47, no. 7 p.959-971dOxford University Pressx0032-07817nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/pcp/pcj0683Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02894naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001500152245005800167300001600225520154300241650001101784650002701795650001701822650002401839650000901863650001601872650001401888650002101902650001401923650001501937650001301952650001901965650000901984650001601993650001002009653002302019653002102042653002302063653002402086653002902110700001802139773011002157852000902267856009202276930003302368946001102401655001202412IND4439602320221122061423.0100709e201008  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443960232DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-3180.2010.00783.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSEAL, A.N.14aThe specificity of allelopathy in rice (Oryza sativa)  ap. 303-311.  aThe objective of the current research was to evaluate the capability of individual rice cultivars to have multi-weed suppressive effects against five currently and potentially important Australian aquatic rice weeds. These weed species are problematic, as resistance occurs to the major herbicide available for their control. Twenty-seven rice cultivars were screened in the laboratory for their allelopathic impact using the Equal Compartment Agar Method against the weeds. Significant differences existed between rice cultivars in their ability to suppress the root growth of each weed studied. Correlations of root inhibition values between combinations of the tested weeds were undertaken to establish rice cultivar inhibition against multiple weed species. All correlations were significant. The highest correlation occurred with Alisma lanceolatum and Sagittaria graminea (r = 0.93), closely related species, and the lowest (r = 0.58) was obtained when comparing Echinochloa crus-galli with S. montevidensis, being unrelated species. The seven most allelopathic cultivars overall inhibited mean weed growth by more than 90%, demonstrating that particular rice cultivars can significantly inhibit multiple weed species. Cluster analysis of the available pedigree information for the tested rice cultivars showed that several rice cultivars with high allelopathic impact in bioassay were grouped in two clusters. This information is useful for plant breeders aiming to incorporate weed allelopathic capability into new crop cultivars. 3aAlisma 3aEchinochloa crus-galli 3aOryza sativa 3aSagittaria graminea 3aagar 3aallelopathy 3abioassays 3acluster analysis 3acultivars 3aherbicides 3apedigree 3aplant breeders 3arice 3aroot growth 3aweeds 0aAlisma lanceolatum 0aDamasonium minus 0aplant interference 0aSagittaria graminea 0aSagittaria montevidensis1 aPRATLEY, J.E.0 tWeed research.g2010 Aug., v. 50, no. 4 p.303-311dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0043-17377nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-3180.2010.00783.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20100715b20100807c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle01675naa a2200301 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004400092040001800136100001600154245006000170246010800230300001400338300001900352520071100371650001801082650001101100650002401111700001801135773009001153852000901243856005701252939003301309945000801342946001101350655001201361IND8004000120221121135112.0800409e198001  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND800400012DNAL7 a10.1093/oxfordjournals.aob.a0857972doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEllis, R.H.10aImproved equations for the prediction of seed longevity3 aImproved equations for the prediction of seed longevity [Barley, storage temperature, moisture content]  ap. 13-30.  ap. 13-30. ill.  aEquations for predicting seed longevity in storage have been improved so that they now take into account variations within a species in initial seed quality—which is affected by genotype and pre-storage environment—and so that they are more accurate over a wider range of storage environments These improvements have been incorporated into a seed viability nomograph for barley (Hordeum distichum L.) which may be used to predict percentage viabihty of any seed lot after any time in any storage environment within the range −20 to 90 °C and 5–25 per cent moisture content.

The inferred secondary structure models were used to account for interdependency of interacting nucleotides in a phylogenetic analysis of the bush cricket genus Poecilimon. Our analysis indicates that the two previously reported conformational structures (i.e., hairpin and ring) of ITS2 are likely to fold in bush crickets as well and that both predicted structures are similar to those proposed for other eukaryotes. Comparing predicted ITS1 secondary structure models proved to be difficult because of substantial variation in their nucleotide sequence length. Our study revealed that the phylogenetic signal of ITS1 and ITS2 is largely congruent with that preserved in the mitochondrial genes 16S rRNA, tRNA-Val and 12S rRNA. The phylogenetic signal in both the nuclear and the mitochondrial genome question the monophyly of the genus Poecilimon: species of the genera Poecilimonella, Parapoecilimon, Polysarcus and Phonochorion consistently cluster within Poecilimon. 3aPoecilimon 0aITS1 0aITS2 0astructure predictions 0apfold 0arnasalsa 0a16S rRNA 0a12S rRNA 0atRNA-Val 0amaximum parsimony1 aReinhold, Klaus1 aNiehuis, Oliver1 aMisof, Bernhard0 tJournal of zoological systematics and evolutionary research Zeitschrift für zoologische Systematik und Evolutionsforschung.g2010 Aug., v. 48, no. 3 p.219-228dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0947-57457nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1439-0469.2009.00553.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20100709b20100807c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03769naa a2200661 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024002800133040001800161100001900179245008300198300001800281500002400299500001500323506007600338520162800414506003702042650002502079650001602104650001502120650001202135650001702147650001702164650001202181650002002193650002502213650001002238650002002248650001402268650001002282650002302292650001402315650001202329650005302341650004802394650003802442650004302480650006102523650002502584650003302609650005302642653001102695700001802706700002202724700002102746700002502767700002902792700002102821700002302842700002702865773011602892852000903008856007803017655001203095IND4423936220221207122124.0090731e200907  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442393622DNAL7 a194873862pmid7 aPMC27182142pmcid7 a10.1093/jxb/erp1382doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHofmann, Julia10aDiversity and activity of sugar transporters in nematode-induced root syncytia  ap. 3085-3095.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe plant-parasitic nematode Heterodera schachtii stimulates plant root cells to form syncytial feeding structures which synthesize all nutrients required for successful nematode development. Cellular re-arrangements and modified metabolism of the syncytia are accompanied by massive intra- and intercellular solute allocations. In this study the expression of all genes annotated as sugar transporters in the Arabidopsis Membrane Protein Library was investigated by Affymetrix gene chip analysis in young and fully developed syncytia compared with non-infected Arabidopsis thaliana roots. The expression of three highly up-regulated (STP12, MEX1, and GTP2) and three highly down-regulated genes (SFP1, STP7, and STP4) was analysed by quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR). The most up-regulated gene (STP12) was chosen for further in-depth studies using in situ RT-PCR and a nematode development assay with a T-DNA insertion line revealing a significant reduction of male nematode development. The specific role of STP12 expression in syncytia of male juveniles compared with those of female juveniles was further shown by qRT-PCR. In order to provide evidence for sugar transporter activity across the plasma membrane of syncytia, fluorescence-labelled glucose was used and membrane potential recordings following the application of several sugars were performed. Analyses of soluble sugar pools revealed a highly specific composition in syncytia. The presented work demonstrates that sugar transporters are specifically expressed and active in syncytia, indicating a profound role in inter- and intracelluar transport processes.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3agiant cells 3ametabolism 3aglucose 3atransporters 3atransfer DNA 3asolutes 3agene expression 3aHeterodera schachtii 3agenes 3aplasma membrane 3anutrients 3aroots 3amembrane potential 3ajuveniles 2aAnimals 2aArabidopsisxgeneticsxmetabolismxparasitology. 2aArabidopsis Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aGene Expression Regulation, Plant 2aGiant Cellsxmetabolismxparasitology. 2aMonosaccharide Transport Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aNematodaxphysiology 2aPlant Diseasesxparasitology 2aPlant Rootsxgeneticsxmetabolismxparasitology. 0aplants1 aHess, Paul H.1 aSzakasits, Dagmar1 aBlöchl, Andreas1 aWieczorek, Krzysztof1 aDaxböck-Horvath, Sabine1 aBohlmann, Holger1 avan Bel, Aart J.E.1 aGrundler, Florian M.W.0 tJournal of experimental botany.g2009 July, v. 60, no. 11 p.3085-3095dOxford University Pressx0022-09577nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jxb/erp1383Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03379naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002700111040001800138100001400156245012600170300001800296500002400314520164100338650002801979650002002007650001302027650001302040650001802053650001102071650001202082650001502094650001702109650001202126650001502138650001202153650002102165650001802186650001602204650002802220650003602248650003602284650002702320650002002347650002502367650004902392650002402441650003102465650005202496650002402548700001302572700001402585700001802599773013502617852000902752856004002761655001202801IND4459154220221121103045.0110617e20110815xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445915422DNAL7 a216817592pmid7 a10.1002/jsfa.43842doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSun, Zhen10aEffects of exogenous nitric oxide on contents of soluble sugars and related enzyme activities in ‘Feicheng' peach fruit  ap. 1795-1800.  aIncludes references  aBACKGROUND: Sugar content is one of the main characteristics related to the quality of fruit. Research confirms that nitric oxide (NO) involves a physiological process and prolongs the storage life of fruit. However, little attention has been paid to the effects of NO on sugar metabolism in fruit during storage. In this study, the effect of different concentrations (0, 10, 30 µmol L⁻¹) of exogenous NO treatment on sugar content and related enzyme activities in ‘Feicheng' peach fruit was investigated during storage (0-12 days after harvest) at room temperature (25 °C). RESULTS: Results showed that the decrease of firmness and accumulation of sugar and acid:sugar ratio in peach fruit during storage were significantly inhibited by treatment with 10 µmol L⁻¹ NO. Treatment with 10 µmol L⁻¹ NO could promote fructose and glucose metabolism during the first 4 days of storage, and increase the content of sucrose and the activities of sorbitol dehydrogenase, sorbitol oxidase and sucrose phosphate synthase in peach fruit during storage. However, acid invertase activity from 8 to 12 days of storage and neutral invertase activity during the first 4 days of storage were inhibited by treatment with 10 µmol L⁻¹ NO. At the same time, treatment with 10 µmol L⁻¹ NO inhibited sucrose synthase (SS) activity in decomposition during storage and SS activity in synthesis from 8 to 12 days of storage. CONCLUSION: Treatment with 10 µmol L⁻¹ NO had a significant impact on content of soluble sugars and related enzyme activities in ‘Feicheng' peach fruit during storage (0-12 days) at room temperature (25 °C). 3abeta-fructofuranosidase 3aenzyme activity 3afirmness 3afructose 3afruit quality 3afruits 3aglucose 3ametabolism 3anitric oxide 3apeaches 3ashelf life 3asucrose 3asucrose synthase 3asugar content 3atemperature 2aCarbohydrate Metabolism 2aEnzyme Activationxdrug effects 2aEnzyme Inhibitorsxpharmacology 2aFood Handlingxmethods 2aFood Technology 2aFructosexmetabolism 2aFruitxdrug effectsxenzymologyxmetabolism. 2aGlucosexmetabolism 2aNitric Oxidexpharmacology 2aPrunusxclassificationxenzymologyxmetabolism. 2aSucrosexmetabolism1 aLi, Yuan1 aZhou, Jie1 aZhu, Shu-hua.0 tJournal of the science of food and agriculture.g2011 Aug. 15, v. 91, no. 10 p.1795-1800dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.x0022-51427nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jsfa.4384 7aarticle03252naa a2200613 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002500164245008700189300001600276500001500292520139700307650001001704650002201714650001201736650001301748650002001761650002501781650001301806650001401819650001201833650001301845650002101858650001601879650003301895650001401928650001201942650001301954650001201967650001101979650002501990650005702015650002202072650005602094650005802150651001102208653002102219653001202240653002102252653001902273653002302292700002702315700002602342773012002368852000902488856008502497930003302582946001102615655001202626IND4437490320221121065403.0100522e201006  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443749032DNAL7 a200630172pmid7 a10.1007/s00497-009-0128-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDuarte-Silva, Erica 10aDevelopmental and cytogenetic analyses of pollen sterility in Valeriana scandens L  ap. 105-113.  a2019-12-04  aValeriana scandens presents perfect and pistillate flowers, the latter with sterile anthers. The species is composed of two varieties with different ploidy; V. scandens var. scandens (2n = 28) and V. scandens var. candolleana (2n = 56), both of which occur in RS, Brazil. Crosses between these varieties may give rise to hybrids with pollen sterility. In this study, we analyzed the microsporogenesis and microgametogenesis of sterile and fertile anthers, and also investigate whether pollen sterility is caused by an irregular meiotic process. Developmental analysis using light microscopy and scanning electron microscopy showed that sterile anthers develop similarly to fertile anthers until the end of meiosis. After this stage, sterile tetrads do not separate as a consequence of exine fusion between adjacent microspores, which is similar to sterile pollen of Brassica ms-cdl1 mutants. In addition, vacuolated immature pollen grains degenerate after separation. The cytogenetic analysis of the microspore mother cell (MMC) showed that the diploid population of V. scandens var. scandens (2n = 28) has pollen sterility that is not caused by a cytogenetic disturbance. The MMCs analyzed from prophase I to tetrad stage showed a regular meiotic process, indicating the phenotype of V. scandens sterile pollen is a postmeiotic process formed by fusion of exine between opposite microspores. 3aexine 3amicrosporogenesis 3ahybrids 3adiploidy 3amicrosporocytes 3acytogenetic analysis 3aBrassica 3aphenotype 3aflowers 3acrossing 3alight microscopy 3amicrospores 3ascanning electron microscopy 3aValeriana 3amutants 3aprophase 3ameiosis 3apollen 2aCytogenetic Analysis 2aFlowersxcytologyxgrowth & developmentxphysiology. 2aPlant Infertility 2aPollenxcytologyxgrowth & developmentxphysiology. 2aValerianxgeneticsxgrowth & developmentxphysiology. 3aBrazil 0aMeiotic behavior 0aanthers 0aPollen sterility 0aTetrad release 0aAnther development1 aVanzela, André L.

The treatment reduced elongation of the two stems by 40 per cent. When only one branch of the pair was treated, its length was reduced to the same extent as the two branches in the previous treatment, while the elongation of the untreated branch was increased by 60 per cent over that of the control. Withholding irrigation induced stem pithiness due to drought stress in non-MP-plants. However, in MP-pretreated plants, the number of pithy internodes was markedly less and the degree of severity of the disorder was reduced. Ethrel application mimicked the effects of MP on pithiness. In some unknown way, the plants are hardened by MP or Ethrel. 3aplant diseases and disorders 0aplant health1 aHuberman, M.1 aAloni, B.1 aJaffe, M.J.0 tAnnals of botany.g1983 July, v. 52, no. 1 p.93-100wJournal:jnl44715x0305-73647nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/oxfordjournals.aob.a086556  a00000000b19840106c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle04100naa a2200601 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002700164245014700191300001600338520206200354650002102416650005302437650004602490650004002536650001102576650003402587650003002621650001102651650002402662650003002686650005202716650003102768653002502799653003002824653002602854653002402880653002502904700001802929700002202947700002202969700001702991700002003008700002303028700002803051700002003079700002303099700002003122700002103142700002403163700002003187700002403207773011703231852000903348856008503357930003303442946001103475655001203486IND4437449820221121065253.0100522e201006  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443744982DNAL7 a204289382pmid7 a10.1007/s10549-010-0887-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMello-Grand, Maurizia 10aGene expression profiling and prediction of response to hormonal neoadjuvant treatment with anastrozole in surgically resectable breast cancer  ap. 399-411.  aAromatase inhibition (AI) is the most effective endocrine treatment for breast cancer in post-menopausal patients, but a percentage of hormone receptor-positive cancers do not benefit from such therapy: for example, about 20% of patients treated with anastrozole do not respond and it is still impossible to accurately predict sensitivity. Our main goal was to identify a robust expression signature predictive of response to neoadjuvant treatment with anastrozole in patients with ER+ breast cancer. At the same time, we addressed the question of delineating treatment effects and possible mechanisms of intrinsic resistance occurring in non-responder patients. We analyzed the transcriptome of 17 tru-cut biopsies before treatment and 13 matched surgical samples after 3 months treatment with anastrozole taken from ER+ breast tumors. Molecular profiles were related to clinical response data. Treatment with anastrozole was associated with a decreased expression of genes relating to cell proliferation and an increased expression of genes relating to inflammatory processes. There was also an enrichment of induction of T-cell anergy, positive regulation of androgen signalling, synaptic transmission and vesicle trafficking in non-responders, and of cell cycle inhibition and induction of immune response in responders. We identified an expression signature of 77 probes (54 genes) that predicted response in 100% of our cases. Five of them were able to accurately predict response on an independent dataset (P = 0.0056) of 52 ER+ breast cancers treated with letrozole. Ten fixed independent samples from the anastrozole study were also used for RT-qPCR validations. This study suggests that a relative small number of genes analysed in a pre-treatment biopsy may identify patients likely to respond to AI neoadjuvant treatment. This may have practical utility translatable to the clinics. Furthermore, it delineates novel mechanisms of intrinsic resistance to AI therapy that could be further investigated in order to explore circumventing treatments. 3abreast neoplasms 2aAntineoplastic Agents, Hormonalxtherapeutic use 2aBreast Neoplasmsxdrug therapyxgenetics. 2aDrug Resistance, Neoplasmxgenetics 2aFemale 2aGene Expressionxdrug effects 2aGene Expression Profiling 2aHumans 2aNeoadjuvant Therapy 2aNitrilesxtherapeutic use 2aReverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction 2aTriazolesxtherapeutic use 0aAromatase inhibitors 0aGene expression profiling 0aNeoadjuvant treatment 0aResponse prediction 0aIntrinsic resistance1 aSingh, Vijay 1 aGhimenti, Chiara 1 aScatolini, Maria 1 aRegolo, Lea 1 aGrosso, Enrico 1 aZambelli, Alberto 1 aDa Prada, Gian Antonio 1 aVillani, Laura 1 aFregoni, Vittorio 1 aBaiardi, Paola 1 aMarsoni, Silvia 1 aMiller, William R. 1 aCosta, Alberto 1 aChiorino, Giovanna 0 tBreast cancer research and treatment.g2010 June, v. 121, no. 2 p.399-411dBoston : Springer USx0167-68067nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10549-010-0887-y3Available from publisher's Web site  a20100522b20100605c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle01944naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127100001700144245009100161300001600252520070100268650001600969650001400985650001000999650001701009650001501026650001001041650002301051650001801074650001901092650002401111650001501135650002701150650002201177650002001199650001701219651001001236700003001246700002501276700002301301773007201324852000901396930003301405945002501438946001101463655001201474IND4371208220221121061041.0050610e200510  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437120822DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Aroma compound analyses by gas-chromatography showed a slight increase of some compounds, that are glycosidically bound, in enzyme-treated wines. Principal components analysis of chemical data indicated out that the effects of varietal characteristics of wines were greater than the effects of enzyme treatment. Generalized Procrustes analysis was applied to sensory descriptive data. Enzyme-treated wines showed different sensorial attributes from control wines and were judged as wines with more floral and fruity aroma and some sweet, ripened fruit notes. 3awine grapes 3avarieties 3aodors 3aglycosidases 3awinemaking 3afungi 3agas chromatography 3afood analysis 3aodor compounds 3aenzymatic treatment 3agrape must 3aalcoholic fermentation 3amass spectrometry 3aenzyme activity 3awine quality 3aSpain1 aDiaz-Maroto Hidalgo, M.C.1 aGonzalez-Vinas, M.A.1 aPerez-Coello, M.S.0 tFood chemistry.g2005 Oct., v. 92, no. 4 p.627-635x0308-81467nnas  aDNAL  a20060622b20060702c00000000  aINDd5CTe2006/01/06  aNon-US 7aarticle02706naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110100001700127245011600144300001600260500001500276520124500291650001601536650001601552650003601568650001801604650001301622650002201635650001601657650002501673650001901698650004401717650002801761650002301789650002701812650002101839650002501860650002201885650002001907650002101927653003401948700001401982700001401996700001402010700001402024773007202038852000902110930003302119945002502152946001102177655001202188IND4371209020221121050446.0050610e200510  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437120902DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

They have the capacity to reduce free-radical formation by scavenging free radicals and protecting antioxidant defences. The present study evaluated the antioxidant potencies of polyphenolic compounds from a spice, Coriandrum sativum against hydrogen peroxide-induced oxidative damage in human lymphocytes. Pretreatment with polyphenolic rich fractions protected human lymphocytes against H2O2-induced oxidative damage. H2O2 treatment significantly decreased the activities of antioxidant enzymes, such as superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione peroxidase, glutathione reductase, glutathione-S-transferase and caused decreased glutathione content and increased thiobarbituric acid-reacting substances (TBARS). Treatment with polyphenolic fractions (50 microgram/ml) increased the activities of antioxidant enzymes and glutathione content and reduced the levels of TBARS significantly. Observed reduction in the level of lipid peroxides showed a decreased tendency of peroxidative damage. We conclude that, under these experimental conditions, polyphenolic compounds effectively suppress hydrogen peroxide-induced oxidative stress. 3apolyphenols 3aglutathione 3aglutathione-disulfide reductase 3afree radicals 3acatalase 3ahydrogen peroxide 3alymphocytes 3asuperoxide dismutase 3acoriander seed 3athiobarbituric acid-reactive substances 3aglutathione transferase 3alipid peroxidation 3aglutathione peroxidase 3ain vitro studies 3aantioxidant activity 3aenzyme inhibition 3aenzyme activity 3aoxidative stress 0aglutathione reductase (NADPH)1 aLincy, S.1 aRemya, V.1 aTeena, M.1 aAnila, L.0 tFood chemistry.g2005 Oct., v. 92, no. 4 p.653-660x0308-81467nnas  aDNAL  a20060622b20060702c00000000  aINDd5CTe2006/01/06  aNon-US 7aarticle02729naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002300145245010000168300001400268520129300282650001301575650001701588650001501605650001701620650001201637650001501649650001401664650001901678650001801697650001501715650001601730650001101746650001401757650001401771650001601785650001501801651001201816653002201828653002301850653002101873700001501894700002101909700002001930700001901950773010401969852000902073856008502082930003302167946001102200655001202211IND4437420920221121050433.0100522e201007  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443742092DNAL7 a10.1007/s10750-010-0259-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCanal-Vergés, P. 10aResuspension created by bedload transport of macroalgae: implications for ecosystem functioning  ap. 69-76.  aPrevious studies suggest that current-driven plant transport in shallow lagoons and estuaries is associated with increased turbidity. Our hypothesis is therefore that macroalgae erode surface sediment while drifting as bedload. This ballistic effect of moving plants on surface sediment was tested in a series of controlled annular flume experiments, where simultaneous measurements of macrophytes transport and turbidity were conducted at increasing current velocities. Sediment erosion always started earlier in experiments with plants than in control experiments without plants. Turbidity increased immediately when plants started to move at current velocities of 2-4 cm s⁻¹. From a background concentration of 7-10 mg SPM l⁻¹, turbidity increased to 30-50 mg SPM l⁻¹ for Ceramium sp., Ulva lactuca and Chaetomorpha linum, while the more rigid Gracilaria sp., caused much higher turbidities (50-180 mg SPM l⁻¹). Such plant induced sediment erosion at low current velocity can explain the observed appearance of turbid waters in estuaries and lagoons in the absence of strong wind and wave action. Based on 3-D hydrodynamic modelling, it was determined that plant driven erosion occurs during most of the growth season in a shallow eutrophic estuary (Odense Fjord, Denmark). 3aCeramium 3aChaetomorpha 3aGracilaria 3aUlva lactuca 3abedload 3aecosystems 3aestuaries 3aeutrophication 3ahydrodynamics 3amacroalgae 3amacrophytes 3amodels 3asediments 3aturbidity 3awater waves 3awind speed 3aDenmark 0aErosion threshold 0aSediment stability 0aBallistic effect1 aVedel, M. 1 aValdemarsen, T. 1 aKristensen, E. 1 aFlindt, M.

This method is based on luminol-H₂O₂ reaction catalyzed by horseradish peroxidase (HRP). The optimum CE separation and CL detection conditions were investigated. After the non-competitive immunoreaction, the free HRP-labeled CA15-3 antibody (Ab*) and the bound Ab*-antigen (Ab*-Ag) complex were separated in a separation capillary and then catalyzed the CL reaction of luminol and H₂O₂ in a reaction capillary following the separation capillary. The calibration curve based on the peak areas of Ab*-Ag complex plotted against the concentrations of CA15-3 is in the range of 0-250 U/mL with a correlation coefficient of 0.9983 and the detection limit is 0.035 U/mL (S/N = 3). The response for five consecutive injections of 125 U/mL CA15-3 resulted in RSDs of 0.83% and 3.1% for the migration time and the peak area, respectively. The method was successfully used for the quantification of CA15-3 in human sera obtained from healthy persons and from patients with breast cancer. 3aantigens 3abreast neoplasms 3acapillary electrophoresis 3achemiluminescence immunoassays 3acorrelation 3adetection limit 3ahumans 3ahydrogen peroxide 3apatients 3aperoxidase 2aBuffers 2aHorseradish Peroxidasexmetabolism 2aHumans 2aHydrogen-Ion Concentration 2aImmunoassayxmethods 2aLuminescent Measurementsxmethods 2aSensitivity and Specificity 2aBiomarkers, Tumorxblood.1 aZheng, Yan-Li1 aCao, Jun-Tao1 aChen, Yong-Hong1 aLi, Fu-Rong0 tJournal of separation science.g2008 Apr., v. 31, no. 6-7 p.1151-1155dWiley-VCH Verlagx1615-93067nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jssc.2007005903Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02406naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002300152245014500175300001600320520126100336650001101597650001201608650002201620650000901642650000901651651001701660653001901677653001801696653001601714653001601730700003001746773012301776852000901899856009201908930003302000946001102033655001202044IND4432285520221121033909.0100205e201003  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443228552DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-2028.2009.01095.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGaugris, Jerome Y.10aEffects of water dependence on the utilization pattern of woody vegetation by elephants in the Tembe Elephant Park, Maputaland, South Africa  ap. 126-134.  aThe utilization of vegetation and particularly trees in enclosed small reserves where elephant populations are confined is a contentious conservation issue. In Tembe Elephant Park in Maputaland, the diverse Sand Forest is considered the most valuable feature to conserve; yet it is considered at risk from increasing elephant utilization of the park's vegetation in general. The mean canopy removal by elephants across the park was studied over two periods: a recent period including the twelve months before the study and an older period >12 months earlier. Age of utilization was determined from the degree of decay observed on woody fibres. The relationships between intensity of utilization, vegetation unit selection and distance to water were evaluated. Results show that utilization patterns have shifted in the recent drier period, during which elephants used vegetation communities closer to permanent water. Concurringly, a significant decrease in utilization intensity was correlated to an increasing distance from water points in the park during that period, while this effect was not observed during the wetter old period. We debate that active water availability management may be a way to limit elephant utilization in small fenced reserves. 3acanopy 3aforests 3aplant communities 3arisk 3asand 3aSouth Africa 0acanopy removal 0amegaherbivore 0aSand Forest 0awater point1 avan Rooyen, Margaretha W.0 tAfrican journal of ecology.g2010 Mar., v. 48, no. 1 p.126-134dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0141-67077nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2028.2009.01095.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20100205b20100305c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02320naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003200111040001800143100002200161245009400183300001800277500002400295520109500319650001401414650002001428650001601448650006401464650003601528650002401564650003101588650002301619650001601642650001701658700002001675700001701695700002201712773010901734852000901843856008201852655001201934IND4404383020221121024630.0080412s2008    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440438302DNAL7 a183064342pmid7 a10.1002/jssc.2007005372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNguyen, Dao T.-T.10aValidation of an ultra-fast UPLC-UV method for the separation of antituberculosis tablets  ap. 1050-1056.  aIncludes references  aA simple method using ultra performance LC (UPLC) coupled with UV detection was developed and validated for the determination of antituberculosis drugs in combined dosage form, i. e. isoniazid (ISN), pyrazinamide (PYR) and rifampicin (RIF). Drugs were separated on a short column (2.1 mmx50 mm) packed with 1.7 μm particles, using an elution gradient procedure. At 30°C, less than 2 min was necessary for the complete separation of the three antituberculosis drugs, while the original USP method was performed in 15 min. Further improvements were obtained with the combination of UPLC and high temperature (up to 90°C), namely HT-UPLC, which allows the application of higher mobile phase flow rates. Therefore, the separation of ISN, PYR and RIF was performed in less than 1 min. After validation (selectivity, trueness, precision and accuracy), both methods (UPLC and HT-UPLC) have proven suitable for the routine quality control analysis of antituberculosis drugs in combined dosage form. Additionally, a large number of samples per day can be analysed due to the short analysis times. 3aisoniazid 3aquality control 3atemperature 2aAntitubercular Agentsxchemistryxisolation & purification. 2aChromatography, Liquidxmethods 2aMolecular Structure 2aReproducibility of Results 2aTabletsxchemistry 2aTemperature 2aTime Factors1 aGuillarme, Davy1 aRudaz, Serge1 aVeuthey, Jean-Luc0 tJournal of separation science.g2008 Apr., v. 31, no. 6-7 p.1050-1056dWiley-VCH Verlagx1615-93067nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jssc.2007005373Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02211naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003200111040001800143100002200161245007800183300001800261500002400279520094400303650001901247650001101266650002301277650001501300650002201315650001301337650001101350650001101361650002401372650001101396650001701407650001601424700002001440700002101460700001901481700002201500700002101522700002201543773010901565852000901674856008201683655001201765IND4404383320221121014934.0080412s2008    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440438332DNAL7 a183062062pmid7 a10.1002/jssc.2007004492doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBlaško, Jaroslav10aGas chromatography/mass spectrometry of oils and oil binders in paintings  ap. 1067-1073.  aIncludes references  aA GC/MS procedure has been developed, optimized, and applied to characterization of oil binders in paintings. The procedure involves hydrolysis of lipids to fatty acids (FAs) and derivatization of FAs to fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) by a solution of sodium methanolate in methanol at an elevated temperature. FAMEs are analyzed by temperature-programed GC followed by full-scan MS. Old and dried samples are subjected to extraction of nonpolymerized FAMEs into dichloromethane prior to hydrolysis. The method provides a good repeatability of results and has been applied to the characterization of common plant oils used in paintings, to commercial oil and tempera paints, to model painting samples, and to samples taken from real paintings. The fresh oils and binders can readily be identified and characterized. The ratio of the methyl esters of palmitic and stearic acids can be used to characterize oil binders in old works of art. 3aderivatization 3aesters 3agas chromatography 3ahydrolysis 3amass spectrometry 3amethanol 3amodels 3apaints 3aplant fats and oils 3asodium 3astearic acid 3atemperature1 aKubinec, Robert1 aHusová, Barbora1 aPřikryl, Petr1 aPacáková, Věra1 aŠtulík, Karel.1 aHradilová, Janka0 tJournal of separation science.g2008 Apr., v. 31, no. 6-7 p.1067-1073dWiley-VCH Verlagx1615-93067nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jssc.2007004493Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03283naa a2200745 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001400164245010300178300001800281500002400299520104500323650002801368650001901396650002601415650001201441650002501453650001301478650001901491650001101510650001401521650001001535650001501545650001001560650000901570650001201579650004801591650008101639650004401720650002101764650001101785650002501796650001301821650003201834650001101866650000901877650001601886650003701902650005701939650002701996650002802023650001402051650002602065650002702091650003302118650002702151651001002178651001002188651002602198700001702224700001602241700001402257700001302271700001602284700001602300700001702316773009802333852000902431856008502440655001202525IND4404350320221121014706.0080412s2008    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440435032DNAL7 a183095212pmid7 a10.1007/s00436-008-0894-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMa, S.

The Echinococcus granulosus sheep strain has already been reported in this focus. To improve our understanding of the role the parasite plays in the high prevalence observed in humans, we assessed the genetic polymorphism of 55 E. granulosus samples (37 from humans) using three discriminative mitochondrial markers: coxI, nadI and atp6. We obtained a total of 13 distinct genotypes which were all related to the common sheep G1 strain. Six of these genotypes have already been reported in China and other foci around the world. The remaining seven genotypes were new variants of the strain. The parasite population which was studied in the present work did not differ substantially from those observed in other foci of CE. Environmental conditions and human behaviour could explain the high incidence of the parasitic disease, particularly in the Tibetan population in the south of Qinghai, most of whom are livestock farmers. 3aEchinococcus granulosus 3aechinococcosis 3aenvironmental factors 3afarmers 3agenetic polymorphism 3agenotype 3ahuman behavior 3ahumans 3aparasites 3asheep 2aAdolescent 2aAdult 2aAged 2aAnimals 2aEchinococcosisxepidemiologyxparasitology. 2aEchinococcus granulosusxclassificationxgeneticsxisolation & purification. 2aElectron Transport Complex IVxgenetics 2aEndemic Diseases 2aFemale 2aGenes, Mitochondrial 2aGenotype 2aHelminth Proteinsxgenetics 2aHumans 2aMale 2aMiddle Aged 2aMitochondrial Proteinsxgenetics 2aMitochondrial Proton-Translocating ATPasesxgenetics 2aMolecular Epidemiology 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPhylogeny 2aPolymorphism, Genetic 2aSequence Analysis, DNA 2aSheep Diseasesxparasitology 2aZoonosesxparasitology 3aChina 0aChina 0aTaiwanxepidemiology.1 aMaillard, S.1 aZhao, H.

We have isolated bostrycin from the secondary metabolites of a mangrove endophytic fungus, no. 1403, collected from the South China Sea. Using the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae as a model, we show that bostrycin inhibits cell proliferation by blocking the cell cycle at G1 phase and ultimately leads to cell death in a time- and dose-dependent manner. Bostrycin-induced lethal cytotoxicity is accompanied with increased levels of intracellular reactive oxygen species and hallmarks of apoptosis such as chromatin condensation, DNA fragmentation and externalization of phosphatidylserine. We further show that bostrycin decreases mitochondrial membrane electric potential and causes mitochondrial destruction during the progression of cell death. Bostrycin-induced cell death was promoted in YCA1 null yeast strain but was partially rescued in AIF1 null mutant both in fermentative and respiratory media, strongly indicating that bostrycin induces apoptosis in yeast cells through a mitochondria-mediated but caspase-independent pathway. 3aDNA fragmentation 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3aantibacterial properties 3aapoptosis 3acell proliferation 3achromatin 3acytotoxicity 3adose response 3aendophytes 3ainterphase 3amitochondrial membrane 3amodels 3amutants 3aphosphatidylserines 3aphytotoxicity 3aquinones 3areactive oxygen species 3asecondary metabolites 3ayeasts 2aAerobiosis 2aAnaerobiosis 2aAnthraquinonesxisolation & purificationxtoxicity. 2aAntifungal Agentsxisolation & purificationxtoxicity. 2aApoptosis 2aCaspasesxdeficiencyxmetabolism. 2aCell Cyclexdrug effects 2aChromatinxmetabolism 2aCulture Mediaxchemistry 2aDNA Fragmentation 2aMembrane Potential, Mitochondrialxdrug effects 2aMicrobial Viabilityxdrug effects 2aMitochondriaxdrug effects 2aNADH, NADPH Oxidoreductasesxdeficiencyxmetabolism. 2aPhosphatidylserinesxmetabolism 2aSaccharomyces cerevisiaexdrug effectsxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aSaccharomyces cerevisiae Proteinsxmetabolism 3aSouth China Sea 0aChina 0aanthracenedione 0abostrycin1 aWang, Jiafeng1 aGao, Ye1 aLin, Huangyu1 aDu, Lin1 aYang, Shanshan1 aLong, Simei1 aShe, Zhigang1 aCai, Xiaoling1 aZhou, Shining1 aLu, Yongjun0 tFEMS yeast research.g2010 May, v. 10, no. 3 p.297-308dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx1567-13567nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1567-1364.2010.00615.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20100416b20100501c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02710naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001400164245010700178300001800285500002400303520132200327650002301649650001801672650001301690650001401703650001801717650001301735650001201748650003901760650001501799650003201814650001601846650007001862650003201932650002701964700001401991700001402005700001402019700001402033700001302047773009802060852000902158856008502167655001202252IND4404350520221120232719.0080412s2008    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440435052DNAL7 a182648192pmid7 a10.1007/s00436-008-0896-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDuran, G.10aIn vitro antileishmanial activity of Adana propolis samples on Leishmania tropica: a preliminary study  ap. 1217-1225.  aIncludes references  aPropolis (bee glue) is a natural resinous hive product, collected from various plant sources. It has attracted much attention as a useful substance applied in medicine due to its pharmacological activities. It was aimed to investigate the in vitro effects of an ethanolic extract of Adana propolis samples on the growth of Leishmania tropica. Parasite cells were treated with five concentrations (25, 50, 100, 50, 500, and 750 μg/ml) of the propolis. The number of promastigotes in each concentration was calculated using a hemocytometer slide at 24, 48, and 72 h after being harvested. In the experiments, it was determined that the concentrations up to 100 μg/ml of the propolis did not exhibit antileishmanial activity against the parasites cells. At these concentrations, there was no changes in terms of morphologically. In addition, there was no statistically significant difference in terms of cell count between control and these three groups (p > 0.05). However, in culture media containing the propolis samples at 250, 500, and 750-μg/ml concentrations, statistically significant differences in cell counts were observed, as compared to the control group (p < 0.05). Our results demonstrate that ethanolic extracts of Adana propolis samples reduce the proliferation of L. tropica parasites significantly. 3aLeishmania tropica 3aculture media 3amedicine 3aparasites 3apromastigotes 3apropolis 2aAnimals 2aAntiprotozoal Agentsxpharmacology 2aCell Count 2aCell Survivalxdrug effects 2aHymenoptera 2aLeishmania tropicaxcytologyxdrug effectsxgrowth & development. 2aParasitic Sensitivity Tests 2aPropolisxpharmacology1 aDuran, N.1 aCulha, G.1 aOzcan, B.1 aOztas, H.1 aOzer, B.0 tParasitology research.g2008 May, v. 102, no. 6 p.1217-1225dSpringer-Verlagx0932-01137nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00436-008-0896-53Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02773naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092024002200127024001900149040001800168100001900186245010100205300001800306500002400324506007600348520127900424506003701703650002601740650001601766650003001782650001401812650001501826650001101841650003201852650001201884650001501896650001701911650001401928650001801942700001701960700001801977700001501995700001802010700002002028700002102048700001802069773009802087852000902185856008502194655001202279IND4404350620221207123508.0080412s2008    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440435062DNAL7 a10.1007/s00436-008-0897-42doi7 aPMC22924832pmcid7 a182597762pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNduati, Eunice10aEffect of folate derivatives on the activity of antifolate drugs used against malaria and cancer  ap. 1227-1234.  aIncludes references  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe folate derivatives folic acid (FA) and folinic acid (FNA) decrease the in vivo and in vitro activities of antifolate drugs in Plasmodium falciparum. However, the effects of 5-methyl-tetrahydrofolate (5-Me-THF) and tetrahydrofolate (THF), the two dominant circulating folate forms in humans, have not been explored yet. We have investigated the effects of FA, FNA, 5-Me-THF, and THF on the in vitro activity of the antimalarial antifolates pyrimethamine and chlorcycloguanil and the anticancer antifolates methotrexate (MTX), aminopterin, and trimetrexate (TMX), against P. falciparum. The results indicate that these anticancers are potent against P. falciparum, with IC₅₀ < 50 nM. 5-Me-THF does not significantly decrease the activity of all tested drugs, and none of the tested folate derivatives significantly decrease the activity of these anticancers. Thus, malaria folate metabolism has features different from those in human, and the exploitation of this difference could lead to the discovery of new drugs to treat malaria. For instance, the combination of 5-Me-THF with a low dose of TMX could be used to treat malaria. In addition, the safety of a low dose of MTX in the treatment of arthritis indicates that this drug could be used alone to treat malaria.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aPlasmodium falciparum 3aaminopterin 3aanticarcinogenic activity 3aarthritis 3afolic acid 3ahumans 3ainhibitory concentration 50 3amalaria 3ametabolism 3amethotrexate 3anew drugs 3apyrimethamine1 aDiriye, Abdi1 aOmmeh, Sheila1 aMwai, Leah1 aKiara, Steven1 aMasseno, Victor1 aKokwaro, Gilbert1 aNzila, Alexis0 tParasitology research.g2008 May, v. 102, no. 6 p.1227-1234dSpringer-Verlagx0932-01137nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00436-008-0897-43Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03666naa a2200613 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001600128245010800144300002000252500001500272520194300287650001602230650001002246650001802256650001202274650001302286650001202299650001802311650002002329650002202349650000902371650002902380650001802409650002402427650001202451650003002463650003002493650002002523650001402543650002402557650003002581650003002611650001302641650004402654650003302698650000902731650001602740650002402756650001402780650000902794650002502803653002802828700001802856773009802874852000902972930003302981945001303014946001303027655001203040IND2057259320221120232649.0970522e19951124mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205725932DNAL7 a74992922pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCline, G.W.10aMass and positional isotopomer analysis of glucose metabolism in periportal and pericentral hepatocytes  ap. 28062-28067.  a2019-12-05  aTo determine whether the source of carbon for the indirect pathway of hepatic glycogen synthesis differs between the periportal and pericentral zones, we studied seven 24-in-fasted conscious rats given a constant 2-h intraduodenal infusion of glucose, 40% labeled with [U-13C]glucose (99% 13C enriched), to raise and maintain plasma glucose concentration at approximately 10 mM. Glycogen, glutamate, aspartate, and alanine were selectively sampled from the periportal and pericentral zones of the liver by the dual-digitonin pulse technique and analyzed by 13C-NMR for positional isotopomer distribution and by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry for mass isotopomer distribution. Plasma glucose mass isotopomer distribution was determined from gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The isotopomer distribution indicates that there was no significant difference between the zones with respect to 1) percent direct flux of glucose into the glycogen (periportal, 34 +/- 4; pericentral, 38 +/- 4), 2) extent of oxaloacetate/fumarate equilibration (periportal, 0.54+/-.01;, pericentral, 0.53 +/- 0.01), 3) dilution of tracer in oxaloacetate (periportal, 0.64 +/- 0.07;, pericentral, 0.64 +/- 0.07), or 4) inflow of pyruvate versus tricarboxylic acid cycle flux (periportal, 0.70 +/- 0.20; pericentral, 0.68 +/- 0.16). Positional isotopomer populations, determined from the 13C-13C splitting in C3 and C4 of periportal and pericentral glycogen, were indistinguishable, indicating no significant differences in the source of the 3-carbon precursors for hepatic glycogen synthesis by the indirect pathway. In conclusion, glucose metabolism is the same in the periportal and pericentral zones with regard to 1) the relative flux of carbon via the direct/indirect pathways, 2) the source of the 3-carbon precursor used in the indirect pathway of glycogen synthesis, and 3) the flux of the 3-carbon precursors through the tricarboxylic acid cycle. 3ahepatocytes 3aliver 3aaspartic acid 3aglucose 3aglycogen 3aalanine 3ablood glucose 3agluconeogenesis 3aspatial variation 3arats 3atricarboxylic acid cycle 3aglutamic acid 2aAlaninexmetabolism 2aAnimals 2aAspartic Acidxmetabolism 2aBlood Glucosexmetabolism 2aCarbon Isotopes 2aDigitonin 2aGlucosexmetabolism 2aGlutamic Acidxmetabolism 2aIsotope Labelingxmethods 2aKinetics 2aLiverxanatomy & histologyxmetabolism. 2aLiver Glycogenxbiosynthesis 2aMale 2aMathematics 2aModels, Theoretical 2aPerfusion 2aRats 2aRats, Sprague-Dawley 0acarbohydrate metabolism1 aShulman, G.I.0 tJournal of biological chemistry.g1995 Nov. 24, v. 270, no. 47 p.28062-28067x0021-92587nnas  aDNAL  a19970602b19970606c00000000  aINDdLDP  aOther US 7aarticle03510naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131072000900149100001700158245012500175300001400300500002400314500001500338520217700353650001002530650002102540650001202561650001302573650001702586650001902603650001802622650001602640650001202656651001402668653004202682653001402724653001702738700001802755700002002773773009202793852000902885856008902894930003302983945002503016946001103041655001203052IND4428627520221120223553.0091113e20091215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442862752DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhydrol.2009.09.0432doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aP2001 aTweed, Sarah10aGroundwater-surface water interaction and the impact of a multi-year drought on lakes conditions in South-East Australia  ap. 41-53.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aSouth-East Australia is currently experiencing a severe multi-year drought (∼11years of below long-term average rainfall between 1997 and 2008). To refine our understanding of the impacts of such climate stresses on lake systems, and to overcome the limitations of insufficient field based measurements, lake water levels and lake salinity values are combined with remote sensing data (Landsat-5TM) to analyse water and solute budgets for two large lakes in the Corangamite catchment. For these two lakes, data during pre-drought (1992-1996) and drought (1997-2006) periods are used to investigate the impact of the drought on lake and groundwater interaction and possible changes in mechanisms controlling the salinity of the lakes. For 26 other lakes in the Corangamite catchment with limited or no on-ground data, water and evaporite mapping using remote sensing data (Landsat-5TM) were used as proxies for drought impacts on lake quantity and salinity. Within the study area, this drought has resulted in a 60% loss of lakes area inundated (220×10⁶ m²), and for the two largest lakes the water loss equates to an 80% decrease in volume (714×10⁶ m³). Although the lakes are groundwater-fed, the rapid declines in lake water levels have not resulted in systematic increases in groundwater discharge to lakes across the study region. The lakes that are most sensitive to changes in the hydrologic budget within the catchment (10 of the 28 monitored lakes) have changed from groundwater throughflow or discharge lakes to intermittent recharge lakes. The decrease in lake levels is accompanied by an increase in lake salinity, however the dominant controls on increases in salinity varies for different lakes between just evaporation, and evaporation plus episodes of increased net groundwater discharge. The drought has exacerbated pre-existing high lake salinity levels; by 2006 one quarter of the lakes have evaporites where previously (before 1997) these lakes were evaporite free. These observations on changes in lakes quantity, interaction with groundwater, and salinity highlights the spatial variability in the lakes response to regional drought impacts. 3alakes 3agroundwater flow 3adrought 3aaquifers 3asaline water 3aremote sensing 3asurface water 3agroundwater 3aLandsat 3aAustralia 0agroundwater-surface water interaction 0ahydrology 0ahydrogeology1 aLeblanc, Marc1 aCartwright, Ian0 tJournal of hydrology.g2009 Dec. 15, v. 379, no. 1-2 p.41-53dElsevierx0022-16947nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2009.09.0433Available from publisher's Web site  a20091201b20091204c00000000  aINDdRHFe2009/11/30  aNon-US 7aarticle02439naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001900110245003500129300001600164500019900180500001500379520112000394650001901514650001101533650001401544650001701558650002001575650002001595650001801615650001401633650001901647650001801666650001201684650001001696650001201706653001801718653002301736653001501759653002101774653001601795653001101811773008101822852000901903930003301912945001301945946001101958655001201969IND2123287320221120223540.0980610e199803  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND212328732DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWoodward, F.I.10aDo plants really need stomata?  ap. 471-480.  aIn the special issue: Stomatal biology / edited by A.

However, these species are small and often restricted to a narrow range of biotic and abiotic environments. The presence of stomata increases photosynthetic potential and the power to protect associated xylem developments from cavitation. Over the last 400 million years the CO2 concentration of the atmosphere has changed considerably and plants have apparently responded, or evolved in parallel in terms of stomatal density, which has increased as atmospheric CO2 concentration has decreased and in terms of the evolution of novel plant lineages. It is interesting to speculate that changes in plant stomatal density may have played a part in these evolutionary trends. However, there is no evidence that the supposed and differential controls by the convective boundary layer on dwarf and tall canopy transpiration has exerted any evolutionary effect, perhaps because convective boundary layers do not exert strongly differential effects on tall and dwarf canopies. 3acarbon dioxide 3acanopy 3aevolution 3agas exchange 3aair temperature 3alight intensity 3atranspiration 3aBryopsida 3aphotosynthesis 3awater content 3astomata 3axylem 3adensity 0aspermatophyta 0aliterature reviews 0acavitation 0aleaf temperature 0atemperature 0agrowth0 tJournal of experimental botany.g1998 Mar., v. 49 p.471-480x0022-09577nnas  aDNAL  a19980702b19980709c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US 7aarticle02022naa a2200301 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092024002200134024001900156040001800175100002000193245004400213300001500257520109200272653001501364653002101379653001601400653002001416653001001436773011701446852000901563856009201572930003301664946001101697655001201708IND4436202520221120223445.0100430e201005  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443620252DNAL7 a10.1111/j.0105-2896.2010.00902.x2doi7 aPMC29057802pmcid7 a205365572pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLieberman, Judy10aGranzyme A activates another way to die  ap. 93-104.  aGranzyme A (GzmA) is the most abundant serine protease in killer cell cytotoxic granules. GzmA activates a novel programed cell death pathway that begins in the mitochondrion, where cleavage of NDUFS3 in electron transport complex I disrupts mitochondrial metabolism and generates reactive oxygen species (ROS). ROS drives the endoplasmic reticulum-associated SET complex into the nucleus, where it activates single-stranded DNA damage. GzmA also targets other important nuclear proteins for degradation, including histones, the lamins that maintain the nuclear envelope, and several key DNA damage repair proteins (Ku70, PARP-1). Cells that are resistant to the caspases or GzmB by overexpressing bcl-2 family anti-apoptotic proteins or caspase or GzmB protease inhibitors are sensitive to GzmA. By activating multiple cell death pathways, killer cells provide better protection against a variety of intracellular pathogens and tumors. GzmA also has proinflammatory activity; it activates pro-interleukin-1β and may also have other proinflammatory effects that remain to be elucidated. 0agranzyme A 0acytotoxic T cell 0aSET complex 0aNDUFS3; NM23-H1 0aTREX10 tImmunological reviews.g2010 May, v. 235, no. 1 p.93-104dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0105-28967nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.0105-2896.2010.00902.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20100430b20100501c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03137naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131072000900149072000900158100001400167245010600181300001600287500002400303500001500327520186000342650002202202650002302224650001502247650001602262650002902278650002102307650001702328650002002345650002202365653002402387700001502411700001602426773009402442852000902536856008902545930003302634945002502667946001102692655001202703IND4428627220221120223525.0091113e20091215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442862722DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhydrol.2009.10.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aP200 0aJ2001 aPalla, A.10aUnsaturated 2D modelling of subsurface water flow in the coarse-grained porous matrix of a green roof  ap. 193-204.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThe analysis of the interactions between hydrologic processes and green roof installations in the urban environment requires to improve the understanding of the unsaturated water flow in the coarse-grained porous media usually employed in such technological solutions. In order to base our research on experimental evidences, a monitoring program was carried out at the green roof experimental site of the University of Genoa (Italy). A continuous acquisition system is available at the experimental site for rainfall intensity and subsurface water flow measurements at 1min resolution. Soil water content is also measured at the same resolution in time by four TDR probes located along a vertical profile. The SWMS_2D model, based on Richards' law and the Van Genuchten-Mualem functions, is here applied to simulate the variably saturated flow within the green roof system. The model was calibrated and validated using rainfall-runoff events observed at the experimental site. The calibration and validation strategy involved comparing predicted and measured outflow hydrographs. The model adequately reproduces the hydrographs, as demonstrated by the limited relative percentage deviations obtained for the total discharged volume, the peak flow and the hydrograph centroid. Furthermore the predicted water content closely matches the observed one at various depths along the vertical profile where measurements are available, thus confirming that the model correctly describes the variably saturated flow field within the green roof. The mechanistic model, based on a single porosity approach, here employed to describe the variably saturated flow within the thin stratigraphy, is demonstrated to suitably describe the hydrologic performance of a green roof, which is typically realized with high hydraulic conductivity and coarse-grained porous media. 3asimulation models 3asoil water content 3astormwater 3agreen roofs 3ainfiltration (hydrology) 3aunsaturated flow 3aporous media 3asubsurface flow 3ahydrologic models 0amathematical models1 aGnecco, I.1 aLanza, L.G.0 tJournal of hydrology.g2009 Dec. 15, v. 379, no. 1-2 p.193-204dElsevierx0022-16947nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2009.10.0083Available from publisher's Web site  a20091201b20091204c00000000  aINDdRHFe2009/11/30  aNon-US 7aarticle02684naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001300152245012500165300001400290520126500304650003201569650001201601650002801613650001301641650002101654650001301675650001101688650001701699650001701716650001001733650001001743650001001753651001401763653001901777653002301796653001701819653002501836700001801861700002101879700001201900700001901912773012601931852000902057856009202066930003302158946001102191655001202202IND4436205620221120223516.0100430e201005  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443620562DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1442-1984.2010.00271.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJIA, XIN10aDifferentiation in growth and biomass allocation among three native Alternanthera philoxeroides varieties from Argentina  ap. 85-92.  aKnowledge about the life-history traits of native conspecifics of exotic invasive plants can be of fundamental importance in exploring their origin of invasiveness and disentangling distinct invasion mechanisms. We conducted a common garden experiment to examine genetically based differentiation in growth and biomass allocation among three native Alternanthera philoxeroides varieties (Alternanthera philoxeroides var. obtusifolia, Alternanthera philoxeroides var. acutifolia and Alternanthera philoxeroides var. lancifolia) from Argentina. Results showed that the high-latitude var. obtusifolia had lower values of relative growth rate and plant size. In contrast, the low-latitude var. acutifolia showed distinctly higher growth vigor. The mid-latitude var. lancifolia generally showed intermediate growth vigor. Regarding allocation, var. obtusifolia allocated a distinctly higher proportion of biomass to storage roots and leaves, whereas var. acutifolia and var. lancifolia allocated more biomass to stems. This pattern of variation might be the outcome of evolutionary differentiation in response to their geographic distributions and local habitats. The acutifolia and lancifolia varieties may have higher potential invasiveness than var. obtusifolia. 3aAlternanthera philoxeroides 3abiomass 3adry matter partitioning 3ahabitats 3ainvasive species 3alatitude 3aleaves 3alife history 3aplant growth 3aroots 3astems 3avigor 3aArgentina 0aalligator weed 0alife-history trait 0anative range 0arelative growth rate1 aPAN, XIAO-YUN1 aSosa, Alejandro.1 aLi, Bo.1 aCHEN, JIA-KUAN0 tPlant species biology.g2010 May, v. 25, no. 2 p.85-92dMelbourne, Australia : Blackwell Publishing Asiax0913-557X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1442-1984.2010.00271.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20100430b20100501c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02922naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001900110245003800129300001600167500025300183500001500436520148000451650001401931650001801945650001101963650001201974650001801986650001502004650001002019650001402029650002002043650001302063650002202076650002602098650002802124650001802152653000902170653001502179653002302194653001702217653001102234653001902245700001702264773008102281852000902362930003302371945001302404946001102417655001202428IND2202624520221120213337.0000217e199906  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220262452DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPalmgren, M.G.10aPumping with plant P-type ATPases  ap. 883-893.  aIn the special issue: Membrane transport: Mechanisms, modulation and manipulation / edited by J.L.

Paper presented at the 11th International Workshop on Plant Membrane Biology held August 9-14, 1998, Cambridge, UK.  a2019-12-05  aIn the past 10 years, research on P-type ATPases in plants has advanced from its roots in biochemistry to molecular biology, genetics, structure, and back to biochemistry. Since the first cloning of a plant proton pump, plant genes have been identified from all five groups of P-type ATPases. These pumps have been implicated in the transport of multiple ions, including protons, calcium, manganese, molybdenum, copper, and phospholipids. To mediate similar cellular functions, plants and animals in some cases utilize entirely different ion pumps. For example, plants utilize an H(+) -ATPase instead of an Na(+)/K(+) -ATPase to energize the plasma membrane with an electrochemical gradient. Another distinction between plants and animals is that in some cases similar pumps are used in different subcellular locations. For example, while in animals the 'plasma membrane'-type calmodulin-regulated Ca(2+) -ATPases are exclusively found in plasma membrane, several plant homologues have been found in endomembrane locations, such as the ER and tonoplast. Through multidisciplinary approaches the next decade should reveal insights into important questions, including: What are the ion specificities of various divergent pumps? What are the structural changes mediating ion translocation? What are the cellular and organismal functions of different pumps? How are pumps regulated? and, ultimately, How can we use our knowledge of P-type ATPases for applications in agriculture? 3amanganese 3ahydrogen ions 3acopper 3acalcium 3aion transport 3amolybdenum 3agenes 3atonoplast 3aplasma membrane 3aisozymes 3amolecular biology 3aendoplasmic reticulum 3aadenosinetriphosphatase 3aphospholipids 0aions 0aregulation 0aliterature reviews 0abiochemistry 0aplants 0ainorganic ions1 aHarper, J.F.0 tJournal of experimental botany.g1999 June, v. 50 p.883-893x0022-09577nnas  aDNAL  a20000501b20000508c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US 7aarticle03139naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002200152245011100174300001600285520160300301650002501904650001201929650001201941650002301953650002201976650001201998650001302010650001102023650001502034650001302049650001302062650001802075650002202093650001302115650001002128651001402138653001902152653001602171653001502187700003102202700002102233700002302254700001902277700002502296700002602321773011502347852000902462856009202471930003302563946001302596655001202609IND4436206320221120213350.0100430e201005  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443620632DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1526-100X.2009.00526.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCraig, Michael D.10aDo Thinning and Burning Sites Revegetated after Bauxite Mining Improve Habitat for Terrestrial Vertebrates  ap. 300-310.  aThinning and burning forests established on revegetated mine pits in jarrah (Eucalyptus marginata) forests of south-west Australia is being considered as a management option to accelerate succession in sites with excessive tree densities. To assess the impact of thinning and burning on reptiles and small mammals, we installed trapping grids in eight thinned and burned sites, each paired with untreated controls. Of the eight pairs, four were in rehabilitated sites (planted with nonlocal species) and four were in restored sites (seeded with local species). Thinning and burning had no significant impact on the small mammal community, although Cercatetus concinnus was more abundant in rehabilitated sites. In contrast, thinning and burning significantly increased reptile abundance and species richness, with two species (Morethia obscura and Menetia greyii) only recorded in thinned and burned sites. We concluded that thinning and burning was a successful management option in revegetated mine pits in jarrah forests, particularly because reptile communities created by thinning and burning were more similar to those in unmined forest. Although published studies for comparison are few, we expect thinning and burning to have generally positive effects on reptile communities in forest ecosystems where fire is an important disturbance agent. Our study emphasizes the importance of monitoring revegetated areas over time periods sufficient to detect deviations from desired successional trajectories, so that management options, such as thinning and burning, can be implemented if required. 3aEucalyptus marginata 3abauxite 3aburning 3aforest communities 3aforest ecosystems 3aforests 3ahabitats 3amining 3amonitoring 3aplanting 3areptiles 3asmall mammals 3aspecies diversity 3atrapping 3atrees 3aAustralia 0arehabilitation 0arestoration 0asuccession1 aHobbs, R.

Mapping and validating transport areas in three headwater catchments in Otago, New Zealand  ap. 54-67.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aValidity of five empirical to process-based, hydrological models described by in mapping transport areas was tested in the Invermay and Glenomaru headwater catchments in Otago, New Zealand. These transport areas together with contaminant source areas form critical source areas (CSAs), where the majority of contaminant loss occurs and therefore represent areas where mitigation potential would be most efficient. Rainfall and 15-min instantaneous surface flows at the catchment outlets and the shallow water table (<1m from surface) dynamics within 5-40m of perennial streams were recorded. In the Glenomaru deer sub-catchment, subsurface flow from a tile drain and surface flow in an ephemeral stream were also measured. In the Invermay catchment, surface soil moisture was recorded periodically during stormflow and baseflow periods to map the expansion and contraction of surface saturation areas. Analysis of spatial and time-series data from August 2006 to February 2008 indicated that during dry seasons (below-average rainfall periods), the majority of stormflow came from direct precipitation, wet areas (areas at or above saturation like deer wallows) adjacent to the stream and semi-pervious areas such as animal tracks. During wet periods (above-average rainfall), flow from these areas accounted for 10-70% of total stormflows. Water table data indicated that saturated areas with the water table at the surface rarely extended >10m from the stream during storm events. There appeared to be an active subsurface (shallow) flow system transferring flows from land to streams. However, during many rainfall events, semi-pervious areas like fence lines, animal tracks and gateways were connected to the stream via infiltration-excess surface runoff, as measured by surface runoff samplers. This may be a significant for contaminant transfer given the amount of time spent by animals on these areas and deposition of contaminants (e.g., in dung) and is explored in a companion paper. Of the approaches used to delineate transport areas during storms, generally the empirically-based curve number model and Phosphorus Index over-predicted stormflow areas. The drainage density approach predicted stormflow areas well, but under-predicted flow volumes by 55-82%. The physically-based topographic index (TI) model and a model combining TI model and surface runoff from semi-pervious areas predicted flow volumes within 6% of that observed, but the extent of predicted transport areas greatly differed from those observed. Among the five approaches, the process-based approaches were identified to be more applicable and expandable for future prediction of CSAs for contaminant loss. In contrast, the other approaches offered little flexibility in representing the dynamic hydrology of these catchments.

All the insecticides were persistent in soil for a short period of time, and the rate of dissipation was highest for fenvalerate followed by phorate, carbofuran, and BHC, depicting the half-lives (T1/2) 8.8, 9.7, 16.9, and 20.6 days, respectively.

Hall, M.R. Blatt, and R.A. Leigh. Paper presented at the 11th International Workshop on Plant Membrane Biology held August 9-14, 1998, Cambridge, UK.  aThe syntaxin family of proteins are involved in vesicle sorting, docking and fusion in the secretory pathway. The discovery of several syntaxin homologues in plants (AtPEP12p, KNOLLE, AtVAM3p) suggested that the general mechanisms of protein trafficking through the secretory pathway also apply to plant cells. The identification of another syntaxin homologue, the AtPLP (AtPEP12p-Like Protein) gene, in Arabidopsis thaliana, which is not present in yeast, is reported here. The putative amino acid sequence of AtPLP shows high similarity to AtPEP12p and AtVAM3p, and AtPEP12p antibodies cross-react with in vitro translated AtPLP. The AtPLP gene shows polymorphism between two Arabidopsis ecotypes: In ecotype Columbia, it encodes a syntaxin homologue lacking the C-terminal transmembrane domain (TMD), whereas in ecotype RLD, due to a frame shift in the genomic sequence, it results in a typical syntaxin-like protein with a C-terminal TMD. The distribution pattern of AtPLP mRNA among various tissues is different from that of AtPEP12, AtVAM3 and KNOLLE mRNA, indicating that the protein may play a novel role in vesicle trafficking in plant cells. 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3aplant proteins 3aprotein transport 3amolecular conformation 3aecotypes 3aprotein secretion 3agenes 3aamino acid sequences 3agenetic polymorphism 3anucleotide sequences 3amessenger RNA 3agene expression 3acell membranes 3aflowers 3aleaves 3aroots 3astems 0avesicles 0amolecular sequence data 0agenbank/u850361 aBassham, D.C.1 aConceicao, A. da S.1 aRaikhel, N.V.0 tJournal of experimental botany.g1999 June, v. 50 p.915-924x0022-09577nnas  aDNAL  a20000501b20000508c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US 7aarticle02475naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002700111040001800138100001300156245005600169300001800225500001500243520097900258650001401237650001201251650001401263650002801277650001501305650000701320650001501327650001501342650001901357650001901376650002501395650001401420650002501434650002601459650003101485650001501516650001301531650000901544650002501553650002101578653001701599653002501616700001701641700001601658773010201674852000901776856007701785930003301862945001301895946001301908655001201921IND2207854120221120213321.0001117e200008  dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220785412DNAL7 a109561792pmid7 a10.1021/jf99109432doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVega, D.10aTriflusulfuron-methyl dissipation in water and soil  ap. 3733-3737.  a2019-12-04  aThis paper reports laboratory studies of the behavior and fate of triflusulfuron-methyl in aqueous buffer and soils. Aqueous hydrolysis was pH-dependent and fast in acidic buffer solutions. In basic buffers, the hydrolysis rate variation was low between pH 7 and pH 10. The degradation pathway in the range of pH 4-10 was via cleavage of the sulfonylurea bridge to form two transformation products: 2-amino-4-(dimethylamino)-6-(2,2,2-trifluoroethoxy) -1,3,5-triazine (2) and 6-methyl-2-methylcarboxylate benzene sulfonamide (3). Comparison of transformation rates in sterile and nonsterile soils indicates that chemical and microbial processes are important in soil degradation. The former is more important in acidic soils, and the latter is more important in basic soils. A biphasic model fits well with dissipation of triflusulfuron-methyl in soil. The triazine formed during the first step of transformation was degraded more rapidly in basic soils than in acidic soils. 3asolutions 3aacidity 3atriazines 3asulfonylurea herbicides 3aacid soils 3apH 3ahydrolysis 3aalkalinity 3abiodegradation 3aalkaline soils 3achemical degradation 3ahalf life 2aBenzoatesxchemistry 2aHerbicidesxchemistry 2aHydrogen-Ion Concentration 2aHydrolysis 2aKinetics 2aSoil 2aTriazinesxchemistry 2aWaterxchemistry 0asulfonamides 0adegradation products1 aCambon, J.P.1 aBastide, J.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2000 Aug., v. 48, no. 8 p.3733-3737x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf99109433Available from publisher's Web site  a20010204b20010209c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US 7aarticle02018naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001600152245011600168300001600284520084500300650002401145650001701169650001101186650001101197650001401208650002101222650002501243650002001268650001501288651001201303653002001315653002301335653002501358773010401383852000901487856009201496930003301588946001101621655001201632IND4436203420221120213508.0100430e201005  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443620342DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1574-0862.2010.00441.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIrz, Xavier10aModeling physical quantities of food and nutrients consumed from aggregate data--with an application to Finland  ap. 293-304.  aAnticipating the impact of changes in economic incentives on dietary quality and nutritional health requires knowledge of how physical quantities of food consumed respond to price and income variations. A problem arises, however, because physical quantities are: (1) not consistent aggregates in demand models; and (2) not measured at final/retail level in national statistics. The article develops a solution by establishing explicitly the theoretical link between composite demand and physical quantities, from which a novel empirical approach to the estimation of nutrient elasticities is derived. It is applied to Finnish aggregate data from the National Accounts and Food Balance Sheets over the 1975-2006 period, and the results are used to assess the potential effectiveness of several incentive-based nutritional policy instruments. 3aeconomic incentives 3aelasticities 3aincome 3amodels 3anutrients 3anutrition policy 3anutritional adequacy 3anutritive value 3astatistics 3aFinland 0aDemand analysis 0aAggregation theory 0aPhysical consumption0 tAgricultural economics.g2010 , v. 41, no. 3-4 p.293-304dBlackwell Publishing Incx0169-51507nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1574-0862.2010.00441.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20120612b20120711c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02070naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131072000900149100001700158245005600175300001600231500002400247500001500271520077000286650001701056650001001073650001801083650002301101650000901124650002101133650002001154650002601174650001401200650002601214650001501240653004101255700001901296700001401315700001601329773010001345852000901445856008901454930003301543945002501576946001101601655001201612IND4428628120221120213445.0091113e200911  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442862812DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aquaeng.2009.07.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aM1201 aSharma, K.K.12aA mechanized harvest system for freshwater fishpond  ap. 147-151.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aDevelopment of a prototype-mechanized fish harvesting system for carp from a rectangular shaped fishpond is described in this paper. The system consists of motorized trolleys on the longer dykes of fishpond, rail, boom pipe, netting arrangement and ON/OFF arrangements. The trolleys move on the rail tracks with constant speed of 3m/min and takes about 15min to complete the harvesting operation. The overall mean harvest efficiency of Indian major carps (IMC) with mechanized fish harvesting system has been estimated to be around 80% per operation. The whole harvesting operation is done mechanically except collection of harvested fishes at the end of operation, which presently requires two persons getting into the pond and lifting out the fishes from the net. 3afish culture 3apipes 3amechanization 3aHypophthalmichthys 3acarp 3aequipment design 3afreshwater fish 3aequipment performance 3afish nets 3amechanical harvesting 3afish ponds 0aaquacultural and fisheries equipment1 aSarkar, Bikash1 aChand, S.1 aNayak, S.K.0 tAquacultural engineering.g2009 Nov., v. 41, no. 3 p.147-151dElsevier Sciencex0144-86097nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquaeng.2009.07.0013Available from publisher's Web site  a20110509b20110603c00000000  aINDdYLPe2010/01/05  aNon-US 7aarticle02868naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127072001700144100001800161242016500179245016100344300001600505500002400521500001500545520141300560650001001973650002701983650003002010650002702040650002302067650002402090650001802114650001902132650002302151653001602174653001602190700001502206700001802221700001702239773007602256852000902332930003302341945002502374946001102399655001202410IND4363713920221120213259.0040804e200310  xx |||||o|||||||||||por||7 aIND436371392DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

All isolates tested caused DBM larval mortality ranging from 70% to 96%, except the M. anisopliae isolate UFPE 3027, which resulted in a mortality of 26%. Based on this survey the isolates ESALQ 634 and ESALQ 447 of B. bassiana and IPA-207 and ESALQ E9 of M. anisopliae were chosen and assessed at the concentrations 10(5), 10(6), 10(7) and 10(8) conidia/ml for DBM second instar. These selected isolates at concentrations higher than 10(6) conidia/ml caused DBM larval mortality ranging from 58% to 96%. The mean lethal time (LT50) for DBM second instar were 1.1 and 4.3 days, and 0.7 and 5.8 days for B. bassiana isolates ESALQ 634 and ESALQ 447 and M. anisopliae isolates IPA-207 and ESALQ E9, respectively. Based on the lethal concentrations (LC50) the isolates IPA-207 and ESALQ E9 were seven times more virulent to DBM second instar than B. bassiana isolates ESALQ 634 and ESALQ 447. These results showed that DBM larvae were more susceptible to M. anisopliae than to B. bassiana and that M. anisopliae isolates IPA-207 and ESALQ E9 may be a valuable component for the integrated management of DBM larvae. 3amoths 3aMetarhizium anisopliae 3abiological control agents 3aentomopathogenic fungi 3aBeauveria bassiana 3aPlutella xylostella 3apathogenicity 3ainsect control 3abiological control 0aPlutellidae 0aLepidoptera1 aBarros, R.1 aMarques, E.J.1 aTorres, J.B.0 tNeotropical entomology.g2003 , v. 32, no. 4 p.653-658x1519-566X7nnas  aDNAL  a20050104b20050130c00000000  aINDdRSCe2005/01/03  aNon-US 7aarticle01195naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002200110245006400132300001600196500005600212520019800268650002200466650002700488650001200515650001200527650003600539651001000575653001100585653001800596653001600614700002100630700001300651700001900664773007200683852000900755930003300764945001300797946001100810655001200821IND2051194020221120213456.0960509e199602  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205119402DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChakravarty, A.K.12aA neolignan and sterols in fruits of Solanum sisymbrifolium  ap. 935-939.  aPart 96 in the series on "Indian Medicinal Plants."  aA new neolignan, designated as sisymbrifolin, and carpesterol were isolated from the berries of Solanum sisymbrifolium.

Paper presented at the 11th International Workshop on Plant Membrane Biology held August 9-14, 1998, Cambridge, UK.  a2019-12-05  aPlasmodesmata serve an important role in establishing cytoplasmic continuity between neighbouring cells within plant tissues and organs. In this symplasmic system, the microchannels formed within the plasmodesmal cytoplasmic annulus function to allow the exchange of small metabolites and ions. Recent studies have demonstrated that plasmodesmata also have the capacity to mediate the cell-to-cell transport of proteins and nucleic acids. Initial insight into this unique function was gained through studies on plant viruses. Numerous viruses have been shown to encode a non-structural protein(s), termed the movement protein, that functions in the transport of viral infectious material through plasmodesmata. These findings led to the discovery that plant proteins, including transcription factors, are also able to use this plasmodesmal highway to traffic through cells of a particular tissue. Similar to viral movement proteins, a number of these endogenous proteins also have the capacity to mediate the cell-to-cell transport of their own mRNA. This special property of plasmodesmata provided the basis for the hypothesis that higher plants function as supracellular organisms, in contrast to the multicellular mode adopted by animals. Current experiments are aimed at identifying the cellular components involved in both mediating and regulating this cell-to-cell transport of macromolecules. Such regulation may account, in part, for the division of the symplasm into developmental and physiological domains. 3aplant viruses 3atranscription factors 3anucleoproteins 3amessenger RNA 3aplasmodesmata 3aamino acid sequences 3aprotein transport 3acytoplasm 3aviral proteins 3anucleotide sequences 3asymplast 3aplant physiology 3ametabolites 0aliterature reviews 0amolecular sequence data 0aplants 0amovement0 tJournal of experimental botany.g1999 June, v. 50 p.979-987x0022-09577nnas  aDNAL  a20000501b20000508c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US 7aarticle01568naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001900110245015200129300001600281500001500297520041200312650001900724650001500743650002200758650001300780650003600793650002700829650001000856651001000866653001600876653003500892653001600927653002300943700002100966700001800987700001501005773007201020852000901092930003301101945001301134946001101147655001201158IND2051193620221120213302.0960509e199602  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205119362DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPaknikar, S.K.10a4-Hydroxy-5-methylcoumarin derivatives from Diospyros kaki Thunb and D. kaki var. sylvestris Makino; structure and synthesis of 11-methylgerberinol  ap. 931-933.  a2019-12-05  aTwo 4-hydroxy-5-methylcoumarin derivatives have been isolated from the roots of Diospyros kaki Thunb and D. kaki Thunb var. sylvestris Makino.

This mRNA was able to cleave itself efficiently in vivo. Using this system, the two steps of mRNA 3' processing, i.e. cleavage and the addition of a poly(A) tail, can be separated in yeast in vivo. The ribozyme-cleaved transcript was shown to be polyadenylated. The poly(A) tail length was similar to the poly(A) tail length of an endogenous yeast mRNA. Therefore, cleavage of the precursor RNA at the polyadenylation site and the addition of adenosine residues to the 5' product require independent cellular machineries in yeast and can be separately analyzed. This is in contrast to higher eukaryotes where both processes are coupled. 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3amodels 3aTobacco ringspot virus 3amessenger RNA 3agenetic transformation 3agene expression 2aBase Sequence 2aDNA Primersxchemistry 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPoly Axmetabolism 2aRNA Processing, Post-Transcriptional 2aRNA, Catalyticxmetabolism 2aRNA, Fungalxmetabolism 2aRNA, Messengerxmetabolism 2aSaccharomyces cerevisiae1 aBraus, G.H.0 tJournal of biological chemistry.g1994 Nov. 4, v. 269, no. 44 p.27378-27383x0021-92587nnas  aDNAL  a19951102b19951108c00000000  aINDdLDP  aOther US 7aarticle02627naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001500128245009200143300002000235520120600255650001101461650001801472650002301490650001901513650001301532650001801545650001201563650003001575650002801605650002601633650001101659650002401670650003601694650003801730650002801768650003301796650002901829650002201858700002601880700001701906700002501923700001801948773009901966852000902065930003302074945001302107946001302120655001202133IND2057256920221120201510.0970522e19960920mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205725692DNAL7 a87984802pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVoshol, H.10aStructure of the HNK-1 carbohydrate epitope on bovine peripheral myelin glycoprotein P0  ap. 22957-22960.  aThe HNK-1 carbohydrate epitope, expressed by many neural recognition molecules, is involved in cell interactions that control cell type-specific neurite outgrowth and regeneration. It is also the target for autoimmune IgM antibodies in demyelinating neuropathies of the peripheral nervous system in humans. Despite its acknowledged importance in cell interactions, the HNK-1 carbohydrate structure, when expressed on glycoproteins, is still unknown. Here, we describe the structure of one of the predominant HNK-1-bearing glycans of bovine P0. The epitope consists of the sulfated trisaccharide, SO4-3GlcAbetaB1-3Galbeta1-4GlcNAc, attached to the alpha1-6 arm of a diantennary core with a bisecting N-acetylglucosamine. It is the first example of a terminal 3-sulfated glucuronic acid on an asparagine-linked carbohydrate. Because the similarity between the glycoprotein-derived structure and the glycosphingolipids carrying HNR-1 is restricted to the terminal sulfated trisaccharide, we conclude that this element is sufficient for HNK-1 immunoreactivity. Knowledge of the HNK-1 structure on proteins is an important prerequisite for the elucidation of its functional role in development and disease. 3acattle 3aglycoproteins 3achemical structure 3atrisaccharides 3aepitopes 3amyelin sheath 2aAnimals 2aCD57 Antigensxchemistry. 2aAutoantigensxchemistry 2aCarbohydrate Sequence 2aCattle 2aEpitopesxchemistry 2aMagnetic Resonance Spectroscopy 2aMembrane Glycoproteinsxchemistry 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aMyelin P0 Proteinxchemistry 2aSciatic Nervexchemistry 2aSequence Analysis1 aZuylen, C.W.E.M. van.1 aOrberger, G.1 aVliegenthart, J.F.G.1 aSchachner, M.0 tJournal of biological chemistry.g1996 Sept. 20, v. 271, no. 38 p.22957-22960x0021-92587nnas  aDNAL  a19970602b19970606c00000000  aINDdLDP  aOther US 7aarticle02904naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002700111040001800138100001400156245013900170300001800309520119900327650001201526650002701538650002001565650002801585650002901613650002701642650002201669650001901691650002201710650001501732650002401747650002701771650002401798650001901822650002801841650002301869650003301892650002401925650002601949653002201975653001901997653002902016653001902045653002202064700001702086773010202103852000902205856007702214930003302291945001302324946001302337655001202350IND2207854220221120201440.0001117e200008  dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220785422DNAL7 a109561802pmid7 a10.1021/jf990640p2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aArsan, J.10aSelectivity of Candida antarctica B lipase toward fatty acid and (Iso)propanol substrates in esterification reactions in organic media  ap. 3738-3743.  aFatty acid (FA) selectivity of immobilized Candida antarctica B lipase was assessed as influenced by various cosubstrate systems for ester synthesis. Reaction mixtures contained a homologous series of even-chain n-acyl donor (C4-16) substrates (FA or their methyl esters, FAME) and a single alcohol cosubstrate (propanol, 2-propanol, or their acetate derivatives) in hexane. Multiple FA optima were often observed, with preferences for C6 (or C4) followed by C14 and sometimes C10. The degree of selectivity among acyl donors was modest (up to 1.28-2.60, based on ratios of selectivity constants) and was dependent on the choice of cosubstrate system. Acyl group selectivity ranged up to 1.31-1.36 for [FA + alcohol], 1.48-2.60 for [FAME + alcohol], 1.30-1.72 for [FA + alcohol acetate], and 1.28-1.88 [FAME + alcohol acetate] reaction systems. General shifts in selectivity were observed between short-chain (C4-8) and long-chain (C10-16) FA as groups with propanol cosubstrate, whereas shifts in reaction selectivity were observed toward specific FA(s) for 2-propanol cosubstrate. Selectivity among a series of alcohol cosubstrates ranged up to 13-fold in esterification reactions with C6 FA. 3aCandida 3atriacylglycerol lipase 3aenzyme activity 3ashort chain fatty acids 3amedium chain fatty acids 3along chain fatty acids 3afatty acid esters 3aesterification 3aisopropyl alcohol 3a1-propanol 3aimmobilized enzymes 2a2-Propanolxmetabolism 2aCandidaxenzymology 2aEsterification 2aFatty Acidsxmetabolism 2aLipasexmetabolism 2aOrganic Chemicalsxchemistry 2aSolventsxchemistry 2aSubstrate Specificity 0aacetates (esters) 0aimmobilization 0afatty acid methyl esters 0apropyl acetate 0aisopropyl acetate1 aParkin, K.L.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2000 Aug., v. 48, no. 8 p.3738-3743x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf990640p3Available from publisher's Web site  a20010204b20010209c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US 7aarticle02517naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001500110245010000125300001800225500025300243500001500496520101800511650002301529650002001552650002101572650002001593650002101613650002201634650001901656653002301675653002301698653001101721700001501732700001801747700001901765700001501784700002601799700002101825700001901846700001701865700001601882773008301898852000901981930003301990945001302023946001102036655001202047IND2202627220221120201432.0000217e199906  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220262722DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDreyer, I.10aIdentification and characterization of plant transporters using heterologous expression systems  ap. 1073-1087.  aIn the special issue: Membrane transport: Mechanisms, modulation and manipulation / edited by J.L.

The boom in the field of molecular plant physiology led to the identification and characterization of membrane transporters with transport activities for potassium, calcium, sugars, nitrate, ammonium, sulphate, phosphate, amino acids, peptides, and metal ions. Such progress was hardly feasible without heterologous expression of the isolated transport proteins. This review summarizes the different approaches in characterizing plant membrane transporters using heterologous expression systems. By presenting concrete examples, it outlines different cloning strategies, displays the methods used for (i) expression of transport proteins and detection of their function, (ii) biochemical analyses, (iii) explorations of the structure-function relationship through mutational analysis, and concludes with a discussion about the physiological relevance of the analyses in heterologous expression systems. 3atransport proteins 3agene expression 3aactive transport 3aplasma membrane 3aplant physiology 3amolecular biology 3aplant proteins 0aliterature reviews 0amolecular genetics 0aplants1 aHoreau, C.1 aLemaillet, G.1 aZimmermann, S.1 aBush, D.R.1 aRodriguez-Navarro, A.1 aSchachtman, D.P.1 aSpalding, E.P.1 aSentenac, H.1 aGaber, R.F.0 tJournal of experimental botany.g1999 June, v. 50 p.1073-1087x0022-09577nnas  aDNAL  a20000501b20000508c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US 7aarticle03370naa a2200661 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001700164245008500181300001800266500002400284500001500308520138800323650004301711650001301754650001801767650001901785650002201804650000801826650003101834650002801865650002001893650001501913650001201928650002401940650001501964650002001979650001201999650001802011650005402029650004002083650002802123650001502151650003002166650001702196650002002213650001902233650002802252650003902280650002702319650001802346653001002364700001702374700002002391700001502411700002002426700001802446700002202464700001802486773009802504852000902602856008502611655001202696IND4404349520221120201418.0080412s2008    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440434952DNAL7 a182244732pmid7 a10.1007/s00436-008-0882-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKim, Tae-im.10aGene expression of Clonorchis sinensis metacercaria induced by gamma irradiation  ap. 1143-1150.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aGamma-rays are a form of ionizing radiation and produce serious cellular damage to nuclei and organelles. Gamma irradiation induces the expressions of genes involved in DNA repair. Clonorchis sinensis resides in and provokes pathophysiologic changes in the bile ducts of mammals. The C. sinensis metacercariae are unsusceptible or resistant to gamma irradiation with LD₅₀ of 16.5 Gy. Using the annealing control primer-based polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method, 19 genes were found to be up-regulated in C. sinensis metacercariae exposed to gamma rays. Contigs of up-regulated genes (URGs) were retrieved in a C. sinensis expressed sequence tag pool and extended by DNA-walking. Of the 13 URGs annotated putatively as functional genes, five URGs were associated with energy metabolism, six with protein processing, and the other two with DNA repair protein RAD23 and inhibitor of apoptosis protein. Four URGs were confirmed up-regulated by gamma irradiation by quantitative real-time PCR. One unknown gene, which was up-regulated to the greatest extent, might contribute to early recovery from gamma-irradiation-induced damage. The up-regulations of genes encoding DNA repair, protein processing, and energy metabolism proteins suggests that increases in gene products orchestrate DNA lesion repair and recover cellular functions in gamma-irradiated C. sinensis metacercariae. 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3aproteins 3ametacercariae 3alethal dose 50 3aenergy metabolism 3aDNA 3agene expression regulation 3aexpressed sequence tags 3agene expression 3aDNA repair 3amammals 3aClonorchis sinensis 3abile ducts 3agamma radiation 2aAnimals 2aBase Sequence 2aClonorchis sinensisxgeneticsxradiation effects. 2aDNA, Helminthxchemistryxgenetics. 2aExpressed Sequence Tags 2aGamma Rays 2aGene Expression Profiling 2aGene Library 2aGenes, Helminth 2aLethal Dose 50 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPolymerase Chain Reactionxmethods 2aSequence Analysis, DNA 2aUp-Regulation 0agenes1 aCho, Pyo Yun1 aSong, Kwang Jin1 aLi, Shunyu1 aHong, Sung-Jong1 aPark, Suk Won1 aChʻae, Chong-il.1 aShin, Eun-Hee0 tParasitology research.g2008 May, v. 102, no. 6 p.1143-1150dSpringer-Verlagx0932-01137nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00436-008-0882-y3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03233naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110100001400127245012700141300001600268500001500284520166200299650001401961650001701975650000901992650001202001650003902013650001502052650001902067650003502086650002502121650003302146650001502179650000702194650002502201650002002226650002002246650001602266650002102282650002202303650002002325650001402345653001702359653002802376653003902404700001902443700002202462700001602484700001702500773007202517852000902589930003302598945002502631946001102656655001202667IND4370401220221120191102.0050521e200507  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437040122DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aGallo, G.10aPartial purification and characterization of an X-prolyl dipeptidyl aminopeptidase from Lactobacillus sanfranciscensis CB1  ap. 535-544.  a2019-12-05  aAn X-prolyl dipeptidyl aminopeptidase (PepX) from Lactobacillus sanfranciscensis CB1, a key sourdough lactic acid bacterium, was partially purified by five chromatographic steps. As estimated by sodium dodecyl sulphate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and gel filtration, the enzyme appeared to be a 49.2-56 kDa monomer. Optimal activity occurred at pH 6.0 and 30 degrees C, with K(m) of 0.6 mM and V(max) of 99.6 nmol mg(-1) min(-1). The D value, calculated at 45 degrees C, was approximately 5.46 s. The enzyme hydrolyzed (almost exclusively) substrates with a X-Pro N-terminal sequence. It did not possess prolidase, aminopeptidase or endopeptidase activities. No hydrolysis of the Pro-rich 33-mer epitope (a potent inducer of gut-derived human T-cell lines in celiac patients) was found when it was treated with PepX alone. When the general aminopeptidase type N was combined with PepX, the hydrolysis of 33-mer peptide (0.2 mM) was complete after 24 h of incubation at 30 degrees C. Leucine and glutamine residues were liberated from the Pro-rich 33-mer peptide by aminopeptidase type N, thus favouring the subsequent PepX activity. PepX was inactivated by p-chloromercuribenzoate, 3,4-dichloroisocoumarin and phenanthroline which exerted a competitive mode of inhibition. Among divalent cations, only Zn(2+), Hg(2+) and Mn(2+) markedly decreased the enzyme activity. Quadratic response surface methodology was used to study the individual and interactive effects of temperature, pH and NaCl on the PepX activity. The enzyme maintained considerable activity under the environmental conditions which characterize the sourdough fermentation. 3amanganese 3afermentation 3azinc 3amercury 3apolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis 3ametal ions 3achromatography 3aLactobacillus sanfranciscensis 3aamino acid sequences 3aresponse surface methodology 3apeptidases 3apH 3aenzymatic hydrolysis 3aenzyme kinetics 3asodium chloride 3atemperature 3amolecular weight 3aenzyme inhibition 3aenzyme activity 3asourdough 0apurification 0amolecular sequence data 0aX-prolyl dipeptidyl aminopeptidase1 aAngelis, M. de1 aMcSweeney, P.L.H.1 aCorbo, M.R.1 aGobbetti, M.0 tFood chemistry.g2005 July, v. 91, no. 3 p.535-544x0308-81467nnas  aDNAL  a20060726b20060804c00000000  aINDd5CTe2006/01/23  aNon-US 7aarticle02266naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092024002200134024001900156040001800175100002200193245004200215300001600257520120300273653002601476653002601502653002401528653002301552653001801575700001801593700002201611700002001633773011801653852000901771856009201780930003301872946001101905655001201916IND4436201720221120191037.0100430e201005  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443620172DNAL7 a10.1111/j.0105-2896.2010.00897.x2doi7 aPMC29179212pmcid7 a205365682pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWelsh, Raymond M.10aHeterologous immunity between viruses  ap. 244-266.  aImmune memory responses to previously encountered pathogens can sometimes alter the immune response to and the course of infection of an unrelated pathogen by a process known as heterologous immunity. This response can lead to enhanced or diminished protective immunity and altered immunopathology. Here, we discuss the nature of T-cell cross-reactivity and describe matrices of epitopes from different viruses eliciting cross-reactive CD8⁺ T-cell responses. We examine the parameters of heterologous immunity mediated by these cross-reactive T cells during viral infections in mice and humans. We show that heterologous immunity can disrupt T-cell memory pools, alter the complexity of the T-cell repertoire, change patterns of T-cell immunodominance, lead to the selection of viral epitope-escape variants, alter the pathogenesis of viral infections, and, by virtue of the private specificity of T-cell repertoires within individuals, contribute to dramatic variations in viral disease. We propose that heterologous immunity is an important factor in resistance to and variations of human viral infections and that issues of heterologous immunity should be considered in the design of vaccines. 0aheterologous immunity 0across-reactive T cell 0aprivate specificity 0aviral pathogenesis 0aT-cell memory1 aChe, Jenny W.1 aBrehm, Michael A.1 aSelin, Liisa K.0 tImmunological reviews.g2010 May, v. 235, no. 1 p.244-266dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0105-28967nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.0105-2896.2010.00897.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20100430b20100501c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02426naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100002200171245003300193300001600226520092300242650001501165650001201180650001401192650003001206650004401236650004901280650001101329650005101340650000901391650002501400650002501425650004801450650003601498650005401534653002701588653002401615653001301639653002001652700002101672773011801693852000901811856009201820930003301912946001101945655001201956IND4436200720221120191046.0100430e201005  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443620072DNAL7 a205365592pmid7 a10.1111/j.0105-2896.2010.00889.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBovenschen, Niels10aOrphan granzymes find a home  ap. 117-127.  aCytotoxic lymphocytes are armed with granules that are released in the granule-exocytosis pathway to kill tumor cells and virus-infected cells. Cytotoxic granules contain the pore-forming protein perforin and a family of structurally homologues serine proteases called granzymes. While perforin facilitates the entry of granzymes into a target cell, the latter initiate distinct apoptotic routes. Granzymes are also implicated in extracellular functions such as extracellular matrix degradation, immune regulation, and inflammation. The family of human granzymes consists of five members, of which granzyme A and B have been studied most extensively. Recently, elucidation of the specific characteristics of the other three human granzymes H, K, and M, also referred to as orphan granzymes, have started. In this review, we summarize and discuss what is currently known about the biology of the human orphan granzymes. 3acell death 2aAnimals 2aApoptosis 2aCytotoxicity, Immunologic 2aGene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic 2aGranzymesxgeneticsximmunologyxmetabolism. 2aHumans 2aKiller Cells, Naturalxenzymologyximmunology. 2aMice 2aPerforinxmetabolism 2aProtein Conformation 2aSecretory Vesiclesxenzymologyximmunology. 2aStructure-Activity Relationship 2aT-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxicxenzymologyximmunology. 0acytotoxic T lymphocyte 0anatural killer cell 0agranzyme 0aserine protease1 aKummer, J.

Highest proportion of efficient strains (larval mortality above 75%) was found from the total isolated per region in the South Region (16.6%), followed by Western Central (3.1%), Southeast (1.1%) and Northeast Region (0.4%). 3aBacillus thuringiensis 3abiogeography 3ainsecticidal properties 3aentomopathogenic bacteria 3abiological control agents 3ainsect control 3abiological control 3aSpodoptera frugiperda 3ainsect pests 3aplant pests 3asoil bacteria 3aBrazil1 aBarreto, M.R.0 tNeotropical entomology.g2003 , v. 32, no. 4 p.639-644x1519-566X7nnas  aDNAL  a20050104b20050130c00000000  aINDdRSCe2005/01/03  aNon-US 7aarticle03140naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100002200171245009700193300001800290500002400308520131300332650001601645650001301661650001301674650001601687650002101703650001001724650001501734650002601749650002601775650001101801650002901812650001501841650001101856650002501867650002801892650003701920650003001957650005601987650004402043650002002087650005802107650005102165650002302216650002702239700002102266700001602287700001402303700001602317700002102333700002002354773011202374852000902486856005502495655001202550IND4395845920221120191020.0071007e200711  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439584592DNAL7 a179227582pmid7 a10.1111/j.1462-2920.2007.01386.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBürgmann, Helmut10aTranscriptional response of Silicibacter pomeroyi DSS-3 to dimethylsulfoniopropionate (DMSP)  ap. 2742-2755.  aIncludes references  aDimethylsufoniopropionate (DMSP) is an abundant organic sulfur compound in the ocean and an important substrate for marine bacterioplankton. The Roseobacter clade of marine alphaproteobacteria, including Silicibacter pomeroyi strain DSS-3, are known to be involved in DMSP degradation in situ. The fate of DMSP has important implications for the global sulfur cycle, but the genes involved in this process and their regulation are largely unknown. S. pomeroyi is capable of performing two major pathways of DMSP degradation, making it an important model organism. Based on the full genome sequence of this strain we designed an oligonucleotide-based microarray for the detection of transcripts of nearly all genes. The array was used to study the transcriptional response of S. pomeroyi cultures to additions of DMSP compared to the non-sulfur compound acetate in a time series experiment. We identified a number of upregulated genes that could be assigned to potential roles in the metabolism of DMSP. DMSP also affected the transcription of genes for transport and metabolism of peptides, amino acids and polyamines. DMSP concentration may thus also play a role as a chemical signal, indicating phytoplankton abundance and eliciting a regulatory response aimed at making maximum use of available nutrients. 3aRoseobacter 3aRuegeria 3aacetates 3aamino acids 3abacterioplankton 3agenes 3ametabolism 3amicroarray technology 3anutrient availability 3aoceans 3aorganic sulfur compounds 3apolyamines 3asulfur 3atime series analysis 2aAcetic Acidxmetabolism 2aBiological Transportxphysiology 2aGene Expression Profiling 2aGene Expression Regulation, Bacterialxdrug effects 2aOligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis 2aQuality Control 2aRhodobacteraceaexdrug effectsxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aSulfonium Compoundsxmetabolismxpharmacology. 2aSulfurxmetabolism 2aTranscription, Genetic1 aHoward, Erinn C.1 aYe, Wenying1 aSun, Feng1 aSun, Shulei1 aNapierala, Sarah1 aMoran, Mary Ann0 tEnvironmental microbiology.g2007 Nov., v. 9, no. 11 p.2742-2755dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx1462-29127nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1462-2920.2007.01386.x 7aarticle03038naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024005000092040001800142100001700160245012300177300001600300500000900316500001500325520162600340592002801966650001301994650002102007650001402028650002702042650002002069650001402089650002502103650001702128650001502145650001102160650002302171650002702194650001102221650002502232651001502257653001502272700002102287700001702308700001502325773012202340852000902462856009702471655001202568IND8903645120221120044558.0191122e198811  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND890364512DNAL7 a10.2134/agronj1988.00021962008000060004x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWolfe, D.

Leaf Area Duration, Nitrogen Distribution, and Yield  ap. 859-864.  aepub  a2019-12-04  aStress effects on leaf senescence are important for maize (Zea mays L.), since production of new photosynthetic area is genetically pre-determined. Interactive effects of water and N deficits on water potential components, green leaf area (GLA) duration, and N and biomass allocation during grain filling were evaluated in a 2-yr field study conducted on Yolo loam (flne-silty, mixed, nonacid, thermic Typic Xerorthents) under four treatments: 180 kg N/ha applied at planting, with (NI) and without (ND) irrigation; and no N fertilizer, with (OI) and without (OD) irrigation. Leaves of low N plants had reduced capacity for solute accumulation, and both water and N deficits caused 0.1- to 0.5-MPa reductions in midday leaf turgor. Total GLA was smallest in the OD treatment, but senescence during grain filling was greatest in the ND treatment because of a high transpiration demand and a high reproductive sink demand for N. Ear removal reduced the rate of post-anthesis leaf N decline of all treatments, and plants in the ND treatment showed a significant reduction in leaf senescence rate when ears were prevented. Grain yield of the OD treatment was <50% of NI yield in both years; ND and OI treatments had intermediate reductions. Although the timing and intensity of stress differed between treatments and years, both water and N deficits reduced leaf longevity, and GLA duration from anthesis to harvest was linearly related (r² = 0.92) to final grain dry weight.

In order to build an accurate battery pack model, we need to build a battery pack consistency model. Firstly, we used a Gaussian mixture model to fit the statistical characteristics of a single parameter. This method can accurately fit the skewness in the parameter distribution and fit the multi-peak characteristics that may appear. Secondly, we constructed a nonparametric battery pack consistency model using a Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN). Our consistency model can accurately describe the statistical characteristics of a single parameter and fits the correlation coefficient between parameters. The battery pack model substituted into the GAN-generated battery parameters exhibits a very high similarity to the experimental data. The relative errors of the simulation results are less than 0.6 % for the terminal voltage and less than 0.3 % for the energy utilization efficiency (EUE), proving the advantages of the GAN consistency model in fitting the distribution of the battery parameters. Finally, we implemented the GAN consistency model in an embedded system with limited computing resources, which proves that our proposed model has the ability to run normally on existing BMS.  aPublisher supplied data 3abatteries 3aelectric potential difference 3amodels 3astatistical analysis 0aEnergy utilization efficiency 0aBattery pack consistency 0aConsistency modeling 0aGenerative adversarial networks 0aEmbedded system1 aZhang, Weige1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7838-03521 aSun, Bingxiang1 aZhang, Junwei1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6362-63081 aHe, Xitian0 tEnergy.g2022 Jan. 15, v. 239 p.122419-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12436x0360-54427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2021.1224193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02931naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245011600163506010400279506007600383520139600459592002801855506003701883650004401920650003401964650001301998650002202011650002602033650001702059650001102076653003702087653001102124653002902135653002702164700007002191700002502261700001902286773012502305856008202430852000902512655001202521IND60758834620221207083209.0220914e20220201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075883462DNAL7 a10.1016/j.lwt.2021.1128982doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZare, Leila10aEffect of atmospheric pressure cold plasma (ACP) treatment on the technological characteristics of quinoa flour  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aAtmospheric pressure cold plasma (ACP) is considered as non-thermal treatment with potential microbial inactivation efficiencies. This study is aimed to determine the effect of ACP treatment on technological characteristics of quinoa flour using Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy, flour hydration characteristics, thermal properties, rheological measurement and morphological characterization. Whole quinoa grains were subjected to a dielectric barrier discharge plasma reactor for 5 min at 50 kV, 10 min at 50 kV, 5 min at 60 kV and 10 min at 60 kV known as S1, S2, S3 and S4 respectively. Untreated sample is named as control sample. Results indicated the significant impact of ACP treatment on rheological, thermal, hydration and morphological characteristics of quinoa flour depending on the exposed time and voltage. For example, while a voltage dependent decrease (p < 0.05) has been found in enthalpy with values equal to 743.6 ± 0.5, 1395 ± 1, 635.6 ± 0.6 and 804.3 ± 0.9 J/g for S1, S2, S3 and S4 respectively, it is positively influenced by increasing the exposure time at constant voltage. Consequently, it seems that the influence of ACP treatment on technological characteristics which is mainly induced by time- and/or voltage-dependent changes in proteins and starch structures needs to be optimized regarding the desired behavior characteristics.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aelectric potential difference 3aenthalpy 3aexposure duration 3anonthermal processing 3aquinoa flour 3astarch 0aAtmospheric pressure cold plasma 0aQuinoa 0aTechnological properties 0aNon-thermal processing1 aMollakhalili-Meybodi, Neda1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8473-75171 aFallahzadeh, Hossein1 aArab, Masoumeh0 tLebensmittel-Wissenschaft + Technologie.g2022 Feb. 01, v. 155 p.112898-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl1644x0023-64387nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lwt.2021.1128983Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03711naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094024002200124024001900146040001800165100009000183245015000273300001800423506007600441520202000517592002802537506003702565650002202602650002102624650001302645650001402658650001702672650000902689650001302698650001102711650002102722650002002743700002302763700006102786700006302847700006202910700006202972773014603034856007603180852000903256655001203265IND60683928920221207135345.0200213e20200108xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068392892DNAL7 a10.1021/jacs.9b125712doi7 aPMC70346512pmcid7 a319136282pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKim, Hyunc(Associate professor of geography),1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9823-645710aHeme-Feᴵᴵᴵ Superoxide, Peroxide and Hydroperoxide Thermodynamic Relationships: Feᴵᴵᴵ-O₂•– Complex H-Atom Abstraction Reactivity  ap. 3104-3116.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aEstablishing redox and thermodynamic relationships between metal-ion-bound O₂ and its reduced (and protonated) derivatives is critically important for a full understanding of (bio)chemical processes involving dioxygen processing. Here, a ferric heme peroxide complex, [(F₈)Feᴵᴵᴵ-(O₂²–)]⁻ (P) (F₈ = tetrakis(2,6-difluorophenyl)porphyrinate), and a superoxide complex, [(F₈)Feᴵᴵᴵ-(O₂•–)] (S), are shown to be redox interconvertible. Using Cr(η-C₆H₆)₂, an equilibrium state where S and P are present is established in tetrahydrofuran (THF) at −80 °C, allowing determination of the reduction potential of S as −1.17 V vs Fc⁺/⁰. P could be protonated with 2,6-lutidinium triflate, yielding the low-spin ferric hydroperoxide species, [(F₈)Feᴵᴵᴵ-(OOH)] (HP). Partial conversion of HP back to P using a derivatized phosphazene base gave a P/HP equilibrium mixture, leading to the determination of pKₐ = 28.8 for HP (THF, −80 °C). With the measured reduction potential and pKₐ, the O–H bond dissociation free energy (BDFE) of hydroperoxide species HP was calculated to be 73.5 kcal/mol, employing the thermodynamic square scheme and Bordwell relationship. This calculated O–H BDFE of HP, in fact, lines up with an experimental demonstration of the oxidizing ability of S via hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) from TEMPO-H (2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperdine-N-hydroxide, BDFE = 66.5 kcal/mol in THF), forming the hydroperoxide species HP and TEMPO radical. Kinetic studies carried out with TEMPO-H(D) reveal second-order behavior, kH = 0.5, kD = 0.08 M–¹ s–¹ (THF, −80 °C); thus, the hydrogen/deuterium kinetic isotope effect (KIE) = 6, consistent with H-atom abstraction by S being the rate-determining step. This appears to be the first case where experimentally derived thermodynamics lead to a ferric heme hydroperoxide OO–H BDFE determination, that Feᴵᴵᴵ-OOH species being formed via HAT reactivity of the partner ferric heme superoxide complex.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aGibbs free energy 3achemical bonding 3achromium 3adeuterium 3adissociation 3aheme 3aisotopes 3aoxygen 3asuperoxide anion 3atetrahydrofuran1 aRogler, Patrick J.1 aSharma, Savita K.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5489-84161 aSchaefer, Andrew W.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6565-920X1 aSolomon, Edward I.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0291-31991 aKarlin, Kenneth D.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5675-70400 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2020 Jan. 08, v. 142, no. 6 p.3104-3116dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19166x1520-51267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jacs.9b125713Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02689naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100005400188245010800242300001800350506007600368520092700444592002801371506003701399650002201436650002101458650002701479650002701506650002701533650002701560650002601587650002501613650001401638650001301652650003901665650001801704650001901722650001401741653000901755653000801764653002501772653001801797653001501815653002101830700005801851700006101909773009901970856008102069852000902150655001202159IND60528772920221207105014.0170713e20160605xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052877292DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jmb.2016.03.0272doi7 aPMC48844772pmcid7 a270497932pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZheng, Amy1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1075-332710aArginine Patch Predicts the RNA Annealing Activity of Hfq from Gram-Negative and Gram-Positive Bacteria  ap. 2259-2264.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe Sm-protein Hfq facilitates interactions between small non-coding RNA (sRNA) and target mRNAs. In enteric Gram-negative bacteria, Hfq is required for sRNA regulation, and hfq deletion results in stress intolerance and reduced virulence. By contrast, the role of Hfq in Gram-positive is less established and varies among species. The RNA binding and RNA annealing activity of Hfq from Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Listeria monocytogenes, Bacillus subtilis, and Staphylococcus aureus were compared using minimal RNAs and fluorescence spectroscopy. The results show that RNA annealing activity increases with the number of arginines in a semi-conserved patch on the rim of the Hfq hexamer and correlates with the previously reported requirement for Hfq in sRNA regulation. Thus, the amino acid sequence of the arginine patch can predict the chaperone function of Hfq in sRNA regulation in different organisms.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aBacillus subtilis 3aEscherichia coli 3aGram-negative bacteria 3aGram-positive bacteria 3aListeria monocytogenes 3aPseudomonas aeruginosa 3aStaphylococcus aureus 3aamino acid sequences 3aannealing 3aarginine 3afluorescence emission spectroscopy 3amessenger RNA 3anon-coding RNA 3avirulence 0asRNA 0aHfq 0asmall non-coding RNA 0aRNA chaperone 0aSm protein 0amolecular beacon1 aPanja, Subrata1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3349-01361 aWoodson, Sarah A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0170-19870 tJournal of Molecular Biology.g2016 June 05, v. 428 p.2259-2264dElsevier Ltdx0022-28367nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jmb.2016.03.0273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02558naa a2200649 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100003000148245004700178300001400225520095600239592002801195650001501223650002101238650001601259650002001275650002601295650002101321650001701342650001001359650001301369650001801382650001701400653000801417653001001425653000701435653000901442653000901451653000801460653000801468653000801476653000801484653000901492653000801501653000801509653000901517653000801526653000701534653000801541653000801549653000701557653000901564653000901573653001701582653001701599653002201616653003001638653001601668700002701684773009401711856008201805852000901887655001201896IND60553484420221119042148.0170607e20151115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055348442DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bios.2015.05.0502doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aQuesada-González, Daniel10aNanoparticle-based lateral flow biosensors  ap. 47-63.  aLateral flow biosensors (LFBs) are paper-based devices which permit the performance of low-cost and fast diagnostics with good robustness, specificity, sensitivity and low limits of detection.

The choice of NPs and the corresponding detection method directly affect the performance of these devices. This review discusses aspects related to the application of different nanomaterials (e.g. gold nanoparticles, carbon nanotubes, quantum dots, up-converting phosphor technologies, and latex beads, between others) in LFBs.

During the last few decades, only very few studies into hyperbaric effects have been published, especially for the most relevant pressure range of up to 10bar. We designed a pressurized measuring chamber to record pressure effects on the electrical activity of neuronal networks formed by primary cells of the frontal cortex of NMRI mice. Electrical activity was recorded with multi-electrode arrays (MEAs) of glass neuro chips while subjected to a step-by-step pressure increase from atmospheric pressure (1bar) to 2 and 4bar, followed by a decompression to 1bar, in order to record recovery effects. The effects of pressure on the total spike rates (TSRs), which were averaged from at least 45 chips, were detected in two cell culture media with different compositions. In a DMEM medium with 6% horse serum, the TSR was increased by 19% after a pressure increase to 2bar and remained stable at 4bar. In NMEM medium with 2% B27, the TSR was not altered by a pressure increase to 2bar but increased by 9% at 4bar. After decompression to 1bar, the activities decreased to 76% and 101% of their respective control levels in the two media. MEA recordings from neuronal networks in miniaturized hyperbaric measuring chambers provide new access for exploring the neuronal effects of hyperbaric breathing gases.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3aatmospheric pressure 3abiosensors 3ablood serum 3abreathing 3acell culture 3acognition 3aculture media 3aelectrophysiology 3afrontal lobe 3aglass 3ahorses 3amice 3aneural networks 3aneurons 0aInert gas narcosis 0aGlass neuro chip 0aHyperbaric chamber 0aGas diffusion 0aDiving medicine 0aMulti-electrode array1 aNissen, Matthias1 aSchroeder, Jessica1 aGimsa, Jan0 tBiosensors & bioelectronics.g2015 Nov. 15, v. 73 p.153-159dElsevier B.V.x0956-56637nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bios.2015.05.0523Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04499naa a2200769 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002600148245015100174300001600325500001500341520250600356592002802862650001202890650002702902650001702929650002202946650001402968650002402982650001703006650002803023650001403051650002503065650001803090650002003108650001103128650001403139650004203153650001003195650003103205651001003236653000703246653001003253653001003263653000803273653000803281653000803289653000803297653000803305653000903313653001803322653000803340653000803348653000903356653002703365653000903392653001203401653000903413653000703422653001003429653000803439653000803447653000703455653000803462653000803470653000803478700002203486700002503508700001903533773007403552856008203626852000903708655001203717IND60552349420221118160642.0161021e20140101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055234942DNAL7 a10.1016/j.gene.2013.09.0852doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMartín-Gómez, Laura10aMolecular characterisation of TNF, AIF, dermatopontin and VAMP genes of the flat oyster Ostrea edulis and analysis of their modulation by diseases  ap. 208-217.  a2019-12-06  aBonamiosis and disseminated neoplasia (DN) are the most important diseases affecting cultured flat oysters (Ostrea edulis) in Galicia (NW Spain). Previous research of the response of O. edulis against bonamiosis by suppression subtractive hybridisation yielded a partial expressed sequence tag of tumour necrosis factor (TNF) and allograft inflammatory factor (AIF), as well as the whole open reading frame for dermatopontin and vesicle-associated membrane (VAMP). Herein, the complete open reading frames of TNF and AIF genes were determined by the rapid amplification of cDNA, and the deduced amino acid sequences of the four genes were characterised. Phylogenetic relationships for each gene were studied using maximum likelihood parameters. Quantitative-PCR assays were also performed in order to analyse the modulation of the expression of these genes by bonamiosis and disseminated neoplasia. Gene expression profiles were studied in haemolymph cells and in various organs (gill, gonad, mantle and digestive gland) of oysters affected by bonamiosis, DN, and both diseases with regard to non-affected oysters (control). TNF expression in haemolymph cells was up-regulated at heavy stage of bonamiosis but its expression was not affected by DN. AIF expression was up-regulated at heavy stage of bonamiosis in haemolymph cells and mantle, which is associated with heavy inflammatory response, and in haemolymph cells of oysters affected by DN. AIF expression was, however, down-regulated in other organs as gills and gonads. Dermatopontin expression was down-regulated in haemolymph cells and digestive gland of oysters affected by bonamiosis, but DN had no significant effect on its expression. Gills and gonads showed up-regulation of dermatopontin expression associated with bonamiosis. There were significant differences in the expression of TNF and VAMP depending on the bonamiosis intensity stage whereas no significant differences were detected between light and heavy severity degrees of DN for the studied genes. VAMP expression showed also differences among haemolymph cells and the organs studied. The occurrence of both diseases in oysters involved haemolymph cell gene expression patterns different from those associated to each disease separately: no significant effect was observed in TNF expression, dermatopontin was up-regulated and marked up-regulation of AIF and VAMP was recorded, which suggests a multiplier effect of the combination of both diseases for the latter two genes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aoysters 3atumor necrosis factors 3aallografting 3acomplementary DNA 3aneoplasms 3aopen reading frames 3ainflammation 3aexpressed sequence tags 3aphylogeny 3aamino acid sequences 3aOstrea edulis 3agene expression 3agonads 3ahemolymph 3asuppression subtractive hybridization 3agills 3agene expression regulation 3aSpain 0aPI 0aQ-PCR 0agenes 0aCDD 0aCDR 0aTNF 0aTHD 0aAIF 0aRACE 0aDermatopontin 0aHsc 0aEST 0aSUMO 0aDisseminated neoplasia 0acDNA 0aBonamia 0aTIMP 0aDN 0aTRAF6 0aUTR 0aORF 0aDG 0aHsp 0aRNA 0aSSH1 aVillalba, Antonio1 aCarballal, María J.1 aAbollo, Elvira0 tGene.g2014 Jan. 01, v. 533 p.208-217dElsevier B.V.x0378-11197nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gene.2013.09.0853Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03072naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001700140245015000157300001800307520155600325592002801881650002501909650001701934650002601951650002001977650002101997650001102018650001402029650001902043650001102062650001102073650001802084650001402102650001702116650002202133650002002155650002002175650001002195650001602205700001702221700001402238700001702252700001702269700001902286700001702305700002002322773012902342856007402471852000902545655001202554IND60663929120221116183228.0190910e20141118xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066392912DNAL7 a10.1039/c4ib00157e2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKim, Si Hyun10aThree-dimensional intestinal villi epithelium enhances protection of human intestinal cells from bacterial infection by inducing mucin expression  ap. 1122-1131.  aCurrent in vitro cell culture models do not reflect human physiology, and various efforts have been made to enhance existing models. Reconstitution of three-dimensional (3D) tissue structure has been one of the strategies, since 3D tissue structure provides essential cellular environmental cues for cell functions. Previously, we developed a novel hydrogel microfabrication technique for constructing an accurate 3D replica of human intestinal villi epithelium. In this study, genetic and physiological properties of the 3D villi model were examined to gain a better insight into the barrier function of gut epithelium and its interaction with microbes. Gene expression study of Caco-2 on the 3D villi scaffold revealed that expression of MUC17, which is one of the transmembrane mucins, was highly enhanced in the 3D villi model, compared to a monolayer culture. Cells on the scaffold were almost immune to bacterial infection, while MUC17 knockdown in Caco-2 cells restored bacterial infectivity. The 3D villi model also exhibited changes in the barrier function compared to the 2D model, manifested by changes in transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) and permeability of FITC–dextran. Knockdown of MUC17 resulted in reduction of tight junction protein expression and further increase in permeability, suggesting an important role of MUC17 in the barrier function against pathogens and xenobiotics. Our study suggests that mimicking the 3D tissue architecture of the small intestine induces physiological changes in human intestinal cells.  aPublisher supplied data 3abacterial infections 3acell culture 3aelectrical resistance 3agene expression 3ahuman physiology 3ahumans 3ahydrogels 3amicroorganisms 3amodels 3amucins 3apathogenicity 3apathogens 3apermeability 3aprotein synthesis 3asmall intestine 3atight junctions 3avilli 3axenobiotics1 aChi, Meiying1 aYi, Banya1 aKim, So Hyun1 aOh, Seunghan1 aKim, Younghoon1 aPark, Sungsu1 aSung, Jong Hwan0 tIntegrative biology.g2014 Nov. 18, v. 6, no. 12 p.1122-1131dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26905x1757-97087nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c4ib00157e3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02619naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002100092024004000113040001800153100002500171245011000196300001600306520110800322592002801430650001601458650002201474650001501496650001701511650001601528650001601544650001001560650002501570650001601595650001801611650001801629650001001647650001401657653001401671653001001685653002601695653002701721700001701748700001901765700002001784773010101804852000901905856011201914856008602026961001302112655001202125IND2324253720221121072300.0200516e20010701ksu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232425372DNAL7 a10113/246622hdl7 a10.1080/00275514.2001.120632002doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPeterson, Stephen W.10aAspergillus bombycis, a new aflatoxigenic species and genetic variation in its sibling species, A. nomius  ap. 689-703.  aA new aflatoxigenic species of Aspergillus, A. bombycis, was discovered during isolation of fungi from insect frass collected in silkworm rearing houses in Japan. The new species resembles A. flavus, but produces B and G aflatoxins. It is distinguished from A. flavus and A. nomius by differences in growth rates at 37 and 42 C, from A. nomius by roughness of the stipe, and from both of these species by differences in the nucleotide sequences in the beta-tubulin, calmodulin, norsolorinic acid reductase, ITS, and lsu-rDNA genes. Aspergillus bombycis is known from nine isolates, eight collected in silkworm-rearing houses in Japan and one collected in a silk-worm rearing house in Indonesia. Phylogenetic analysis of the DNA sequences shows that A. bombycis is a phylogenetically distinct species which is most closely related to A. nomius and which belongs in Aspergillus section Flavi. Analysis by partition homogeneity did not reveal evidence of genetic recombination in A. bombycis, but in A. nomius the patterns of polymorphisms in different genes strongly suggest cryptic genetic recombination.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAspergillus 3agenetic variation 3aaflatoxins 3abiosynthesis 3anew species 3aBombyx mori 3afeces 3anucleotide sequences 3atemperature 3achemotaxonomy 3aribosomal DNA 3agenes 3aphylogeny 0aaflatoxin 0afungi 0amolecular systematics 0aribosomal DNA sequence1 aItō, Yōko,1 aHorn, Bruce W.1 aGoto, Tetsuhisa0 tMycologia.g2001 July 1, v. 93, no. 4 p.689-703dTaylor & FranciswJournal:1951x1557-25367nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/246623Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00275514.2001.120632003Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle02241naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245014100169300001400310500001900324520084300343592002801186596001701214596001501231650001601246650002601262650002401288650001901312650001201331650001401343650001301357653002701370653001801397653002601415700001901441700001501460700002001475700001601495700001501511700001401526700001801540773013101558856008501689852000901774655001201783IND60732289520221120154632.0210326e20210102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073228952DNAL7 a10.1080/0972060X.2021.18758882doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShao, Ya-Zhou10aBioactivities and Chemical Constituents of Essential Oils Extracted from Caryopteris mongholica Bunge against Two Stored-Product Insects  ap. 22-30.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThis work investigated the chemical constituents of the essential oil (EO) extracted from different organs (whole plants, flower and fruits, leave and branches) of Caryopteris mongholica. At the same time, the fumigant, contact and repellent effect of the EO from C. mongholica against Lasioderma serricorne and Tribolium castaneum were evaluated. The main chemical components were identified from the EO included β-pinene (24.77 %), 4-terpineol (15.80 %), β-cis-ocimene (9.31 %), α-pinene (8.20 %), 2-isopropyltoluene (7.37 %). The results of bioassays indicated that EO was toxicity to T. castaneum than L. serricorne. The results also showed that possessed stronger repellent activity against T. castaneum than L. serricorne. The results provided a basis for the development and utilization in the future for the control of insects.  aPublisher supplied data  aNo. 51873175  aNo.2020C-9 3aCaryopteris 3aLasioderma serricorne 3aTribolium castaneum 3aessential oils 3aflowers 3afumigants 3atoxicity 0aCaryopteris mongholica 0aessential oil 0ainsecticidal activity1 aHou, Qin-Zheng1 aXie, Zi-Yi1 aYang, Ying-Ying1 aHe, Chun-Yu1 aZhou, Feng1 aZhang, Ji1 aLiang, Jun-Yu0 tJournal of essential oil-bearing plants.g2021 Jan. 02, v. 24, no. 1 p.22-30dTaylor & FranciswJournal:12282x0976-50267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/0972060X.2021.18758883Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02573naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002700151245008200178520144300260592002801703650002101731650001601752650002101768650002101789650002501810650001401835650002201849650001201871653002901883653000801912653002501920653001401945653001101959700002101970773011301991856008602104852000902190655001202199IND60684705920221122034409.0210212e20200610xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068470592DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.1207042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBraulio-Gonzalo, Marta10aCriteria analysis of green public procurement in the Spanish furniture sector  aGreen Public Procurement (GPP) constitutes a potential policy instrument to reduce the environmental impact of products, services and works, and to create environmental value for society. Further requirements had to be recently incorporated into tenders to boost sustainability in the production and consumption market to favour circular economy. The awarding process used by public institutions while tenders are being evaluated becomes especially relevant in the performance of the final purchased product or service. This paper describes an in-depth analysis performed on the GPP criteria for furniture, which is identified as one of the priority sectors for circular economy. Forty-three tenders from the Spanish furniture sector were content-analysed and the criteria included in them were identified and clustered. The results showed how environmental, technical, social and other considerations are being included in tenders and which weight is granted to them during the awarding process. The results reveal that, although environmental criteria are being progressively introduced, these are still tentatively present (average weight of 6.02%) and the economic aspect is still the most decisive one (73.14%), followed by the technical (18.67%). A high potential was found in the furniture sector regarding innovation, ecolabel integration, public staff training and policy development towards enhancing the market’s circularity.  aPublisher supplied data 3acircular economy 3aecolabeling 3aecological value 3aeconomic factors 3aenvironmental impact 3afurniture 3aissues and policy 3amarkets 0aGreen public procurement 0aGPP 0aEnvironmental policy 0aFurniture 0aTender1 aBovea, María D.0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2020 June 10, v. 258 p.120704-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.1207043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02753naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100002000171245010500191300001600296500002000312500001500332520101300347592002801360650002101388650002401409650001001433650001801443650002001461650002001481650002001501650001401521650002501535650002501560650002401585650002401609650001201633650001101645650001901656650002001675650001501695650004301710650000901753650002201762650003601784650000901820650002501829650002801854650002201882653000801904700001701912700001301929773012301942852000902065856008902074655001202163IND2330339720221118222146.0180516e200206  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233033972DNAL7 a120006462pmid7 a10.1046/j.1365-2583.2002.00334.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBettencourt, R.10aHemolin gene silencing by ds‐RNA injected into Cecropia pupae is lethal to next generation embryos  ap. 267-271.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  a2019-12-04  aThere is increasing evidence of an intimate connection between participants in the innate immune system and in development. Molecules involved in the determination of dorso‐ventral polarity in Drosophila have related counterparts in the signalling pathways for immune gene activation in both insects and mammals. Hemolin from the Giant silkmoth, Hyalophora cecropia, identified as a bacteria‐inducible molecule and a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily, is present as protein and transcripts in oocytes and embryos. We used RNA interference (RNAi) to investigate H. cecropia gene function in vivo and demonstrated that Hemolin is crucial for the normal development of embryos. When RNAi‐females were mated, no larvae emerged from their eggs and when dissected, the eggs revealed malformed embryos. Western blot analysis confirmed the lack of Hemolin gene products. We conclude that Hemolin is necessary for development, since the silencing of Hemolin gene expression leads to embryonic lethality.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRNA interference 3aHyalophora cecropia 3apupae 3aembryogenesis 3aembryo (animal) 3aimmunoglobulins 3agene expression 3ainjection 3aimmunoglobulin genes 3aabnormal development 3adouble-stranded RNA 3aembryonic mortality 2aAnimals 2aFemale 2aGene Silencing 2aImmunoglobulins 2aInjections 2aInsect Proteinsxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aMale 2aMothsxembryology 2aProteinsxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aPupa 2aRNA, Double-Stranded 2aRNA, Small Interfering. 2aRNA, Untranslated 0aRNA1 aTerenius, O.1 aFaye, I.0 tInsect molecular biology.g2002 June, v. 11, no. 3 p.267-271dBlackwell Science LtdwJournal:jnl52413x0962-10757nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-2583.2002.00334.x3Available from publisher's site 7aarticle02839naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245011000166506011700276506007600393520133100469592002801800506003701828650001101865650002001876650001501896650002401911650001701935650001601952653000901968653001601977653003101993653001902024700001302043700001502056700001402071700001302085700001302098700001602111700001602127700001802143700001502161773010102176856008302277852000902360655001202369IND60767277120221207131721.0220719e202204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076727712DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ejrh.2022.1010342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZheng, Yalian10aExtracting operation behaviors of cascade reservoirs using physics-guided long-short term memory networks  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aQingjiang cascade reservoir, China. Reservoirs regulate the natural streamflow to utilize water resources comprehensively. How to mine the existing massive reservoir operation data to describe human operation behaviors is a challenge. To address this issue, a data-driven method, Long short-term memory (LSTM), was used to simulate the reservoir outflow by inputting historical information. The physics-guided LSTM model, shortly named PG-LSTM, was formulated by using synthetic flood samples and physical constraints of water balance, boundary, and monotonicity. (1) PG-LSTM can reproduce historical outflow with seasonal variations, or predict outflow without lags, (2) knowledge of reservoir operations can guide LSTM with the reduction of negative flow occurrence and the accurate identification of operation behaviors under extreme hydrological conditions, (3) specifically, compared with conventional LSTM, gradient boosting regression tree and conventional reservoir operation, PG-LSTM can improve the Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency of cascade reservoir during the test period from 0.50, 0.20, and 0.17 to 0.54 in the reproduction scenario, and from 0.84, 0.26, and 0.17 to 0.85 in the prediction scenario with five-fold cross-validation method. The PG-LSTM is helpful to describe human operation behaviors of reservoirs.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3ahumans 3aneural networks 3aprediction 3aregression analysis 3areproduction 3astream flow 0aLSTM 0aData-driven 0aExtracting human behaviors 0aPhysics-guided1 aLiu, Pan1 aCheng, Lei1 aXie, Kang1 aLou, Wei1 aLi, Xiao1 aLuo, Xinran1 aCheng, Qian1 aHan, Dongyang1 aZhang, Wei0 tJournal of hydrology.g2022 Apr., v. 40 p.101034-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23229x2214-58187nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ejrh.2022.1010343Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03151naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002200140245012400162500001900286520196400305592002802269650003002297650001102327650001402338650000902352650001102361650001802372650001102390650000902401650002502410650002902435650001502464650001402479651001602493700002002509700001902529773012202548856007402670852000902744655001202753IND60732162820221121030812.0210326e20210305xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073216282DNAL7 a10.3390/nu130308512doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKang, Min  Gyeong10aIs It What They Eat or How Much They Eat That Matters More in Adults with Food Insecurity in a Wealthy-Country Context?  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThis study aimed to investigate whether dietary quantity and/or quality differ according to food security levels in the Korean adult population. Dietary adequacy and quality were evaluated by the Korean Dietary Reference Intake and the Korean Healthy Eating Index (KHEI) for adults, respectively, according to three food security levels, i.e., food security, low food security, and very low food security. A total of 7144 Korean adults (aged 19 to 64 years) were selected from cross-sectional data from the 2013–2015 Korean National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys. The risk of inadequate nutrient intakes of protein (p trend = 0.021) and phosphorus (p trend = 0.002) increased according to food insecurity levels after adjustment for putative risk factors. The total KHEI scores (p < 0.001) as well as scores of having breakfast (p < 0.001) were lowest in the very low food security group. Among KHEI components, adults with food insecurity were less likely to get full scores from intakes of mixed grains (p trend = 0.016), total fruit (p trend = 0.039), fresh fruit (p trend = 0.043), and breakfast (p trend < 0.001). In addition, food-insecure adults were more likely to get zero score from intakes of fresh fruit (p trend = 0.020), milk and dairy products (p trend = 0.049), breakfast (p trend < 0.001), % of energy from sweets and beverages (p trend = 0.002), and total energy (p trend = 0.033). In conclusion, food security levels were associated with how much they ate, as well what they ate, in adults in South Korea. These results implied that the diet adequacy as well as moderation and balance could be carefully treated with food assistance or nutrition intervention once nutritional adequacy has mostly been met. In addition, targeted intervention programs tailored to diverse contexts for improving food insecurity may prevent unintended consequences due to easy access to inexpensive obesogenic foods in adults with food insecurity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDietary Reference Intakes 3aadults 3abreakfast 3adiet 3aenergy 3afood security 3afruits 3amilk 3anutritional adequacy 3anutritional intervention 3aphosphorus 3araw fruit 3aSouth Korea1 aYook, Sung-Min 1 aHwang, Ji-Yun 0 tNutrients.g2021 Mar. 05, v. 13, no. 3dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2271x2072-66437nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/nu130308513Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01976naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100005800150245010900208300001200317520090600329592002801235650001201263650002001275650001401295650001101309650001501320650001501335653002501350653001301375653001101388653002601399653001101425773009601436856008501532852000901617655001201626IND60591987220221120044912.0190412e201805  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059198722DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecocom.2018.02.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIvanko, Evgeny1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3248-588510aIs evolution always “egolution”: Discussion of evolutionary efficiency of altruistic energy exchange  ap. 1-8.  aIn the article I study the evolutionary adaptivity of two conceptual population models, based on either altruistic or egoistic law of energy exchange. During the extensive computational experiments, the models were compared by their ability to survive both “series of cataclysms” (fast extreme changes of the environment) and one radical change after a long stasis. The computational experiments show a convincing advantage of the altruists: there is a considerable area in the experiment’s parameter space where the altruists succeeded in both experiments; however there were no egoist populations found that could pass even the first trial. The examined models are pruned to the extent where the effect of energy exchange strategy is clearly visible. The obtained results could warm up the interest to the positive role of altruistic phenomena in evolution, ecology, technology and philosophy.  aPublisher supplied data 3aecology 3aenergy transfer 3aevolution 3amodels 3aphilosophy 3atechnology 0aArtificial evolution 0aAltruism 0aEgoism 0aPopulation bottleneck 0aStasis0 tEcological complexity.g2018 May, v. 34 p.1-8dElsevier B.V.wJournal:2171x1476-945X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecocom.2018.02.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03113naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002700144245008500171300002000256520179100276592002802067650001602095650002402111650002802135650001502163650001702178650001302195650001402208650002602222650002602248650001902274650001902293650001702312653001902329653001302348653002802361653002002389653003402409700002002443773012902463856007802592852000902670655001202679IND60548686320221119182551.0160905e20160831xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054868632DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.5b093442doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDenisin, Aleksandra K.10aTuning the Range of Polyacrylamide Gel Stiffness for Mechanobiology Applications  ap. 21893-21902.  aAdjusting the acrylamide monomer and cross-linker content in polyacrylamide gels controls the hydrogel stiffness, yet the reported elastic modulus for the same formulations varies widely and these discrepancies are frequently attributed to different measurement methods. Few studies exist that examine stiffness trends across monomer and cross-linker concentrations using the same characterization platform. In this work, we use Atomic Force Microscopy and analyze force–distance curves to derive the elastic modulus of polyacrylamide hydrogels. We find that gel elastic modulus increases with increasing cross-link concentration until an inflection point, after which gel stiffness decreases with increasing cross-linking. This behavior arises because of the formation of highly cross-linked clusters, which add inhomogeneity and heterogeneity to the network structure, causing the global network to soften even under high cross-linking conditions. We identify these inflection points for three different total polymer formulations. When we alter gelation kinetics by using a low polymerization temperature, we find that gels are stiffer when polymerized at 4 °C compared to room temperature, indicating a complex relationship between gel structure, elasticity, and network formation. We also investigate how gel stiffness changes during storage over 10 days and find that specific gel formulations undergo significant stiffening (1.55 ± 0.13), which may be explained by differences in gel swelling resulting from initial polymerization parameters. Taken together, our study emphasizes the importance of polyacrylamide formulation, polymerization temperature, gelation time, and storage duration in defining the structural and mechanical properties of the polyacrylamide hydrogels.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacrylamides 3aambient temperature 3aatomic force microscopy 3abiophysics 3acrosslinking 3agelation 3ahydrogels 3amechanical properties 3amodulus of elasticity 3apolyacrylamide 3apolymerization 3astorage time 0apolyacrylamide 0ahydrogel 0aatomic force microscopy 0aelastic modulus 0asubstrates for mechanobiology1 aPruitt, Beth L.0 tACS applied materials .g2016 Aug. 31, v. 8, no. 34 p.21893-21902dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.5b093443Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03510naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094024002900126040001800155100002200173245016100195300001800356500001900374506007600393506003100469520174100500592002802241596004502269506003702314650001802351650002802369650001502397650002102412650000902433650001502442650001202457650001502469650001502484650000902499650002402508650001102532650001502543650001002558653001602568653001602584653001202600653002302612700002202635700002402657700002302681700002102704773014602725856007602871852000902947655001202956IND60716592620221207131806.0201106e20200831xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071659262DNAL7 a10.1093/jee/toaa1862chorus7 a10.1093/jee/toaa1862doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBrown, Matthew S.10aPermethrin Residual Activity Against Ambrosia Beetle (Coleoptera: Curculionidae: Scolytinae) Attacks Following Field Aging and Simulated Rainfall Weathering  ap. 2418-2426.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aCHORUS License Information  aAdult ambrosia beetles (Coleoptera: Curculionidae: Scolytinae) bore into ornamental nursery trees resulting in trunk vascular tissue damage, which can potentially kill trees. Ambrosia beetle exposure to surface-applied insecticides is minimal after internal trunk galleries are formed, so effective management requires insecticide treatments to be applied near the time of infestation or to have residual activity on the bark. Tree trunk sections (bolts) were used to determine the effect of field aging or irrigation (i.e., simulated rainfall weathering) on permethrin residual activity against ambrosia beetles. In all experiments, 30-cm-long bolts from Liriodendron tulipifera L. (Magnoliales: Magnoliaceae) were hollowed and filled with 70% ethanol at field deployment to induce ambrosia beetle attacks over a 2-wk period. To evaluate insecticide residual activity, permethrin was sprayed onto tree bolts at 0, 8, 17, or 24 d before ethanol addition, and then bolts were deployed along a wooded border in fall 2017 and spring 2018. Tree bolts with permethrin residues ≤17 d old had significantly fewer ambrosia beetle attacks than bolts with 24-d-old residues or the non-permethrin-treated control bolts. To evaluate simulated rainfall weathering, permethrin was applied to tree bolts 8 or 22 d before ethanol (spring 2018) or 10 or 24 d before ethanol (fall 2018) with half of the bolts receiving regular irrigation events. Irrigation had no significant effect on permethrin residual activity against ambrosia beetles during either test. This study determined ambrosia beetle control was affected by permethrin residue age more than simulated rainfall weathering, and a reapplication interval of ≤17 d maximized beetle control.  aPublisher supplied data  cUSDAdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/1000001990 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aCurculionidae 3aLiriodendron tulipifera 3aScolytidae 3aambrosia beetles 3abark 3aentomology 3aethanol 3airrigation 3apermethrin 3arain 3arainfall simulation 3aspring 3atree trunk 3atrees 0ainsecticide 0aXylosandrus 0anursery 0aresidue weathering1 aAddesso, Karla M.1 aBaysal-Gurel, Fulya1 aYoussef, Nadeer N.1 aOliver, Jason B.0 tJournal of economic entomology.g2020 Aug. 31, v. 113, no. 5 p.2418-2426dEntomological Society of AmericawJournal:jnl46276x0022-04937nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jee/toaa1863Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03650naa a2200601 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003200092040001800124100002600142245012300168300001600291520193100307592002802238650002202266650001602288650002602304650002102330650003802351650002302389650000902412650002502421650001602446650001102462650001402473650001302487650001602500650001702516650001002533650000902543650001002552650001502562650002202577650002102599650002402620650000702644650000902651650003902660650003002699650001602729650001402745650002202759650000902781650002202790650001602812650001802828700002602846773011002872856004502982852000903027655001203036IND4520846120221120085124.0151109e201206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND452084612DNAL7 a10.1002/jobm.2011002322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSingh, Naosekpam Ajit10aCloning and characterization of a bifunctional glycosyl hydrolase from an antagonistic Pseudomonas putida strain P3(4)  ap. 340-349.  aA fluorescent pseudomonad strain P3(4) showing chitinolysis on chitinase detection agar and antagonism against Fusarium oxysporum f.sp dianthi causing vascular wilt of carnation was isolated from pea rhizosphere soil. PCR primers specific for glycosyl hydrolase family 5 (GH5) of Pseudomonas putida isolate KT2440 amplified a 947 bp fragment of the GH5 gene from P3(4). Cloning of this gene into Escherichia coli M15 using an expression vector pQEâ30UA and screening on chitin and chitosan detection agar identified one positive clone (Pchi+).

The deduced amino acid sequence of the open reading frame (gene product/GH) showed 83â84% homology to the GH5 of P. putida strains F1 and KT2440, respectively. The purified enzyme was homogenous, as examined by sodium dodecyl sulfateâpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and was visualized as single fluorescent band in native gel assay with 4âmethylumbelliferylâN âacetylâÎ²;âDâglucosaminide and glycol chitosan, respectively.

We constructed a peroxidase mimic through the grafting of heme onto metal-organic frameworks UiO-66-NH2 (ZrMOF), namely Heme-ZrMOF. After the systematic characterization of structure, the composite Heme-ZrMOF was demonstrated to possess high peroxidase activity using 2,2′-azinobis-(3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulphonate) and 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine as substrates. The enzyme mimic was then used as catalysts in the ATRP reactions of different monomers, in which favorable monomer conversion (44.6–98.0%) and product molecular weight (8600–25,600 g/mol) could be obtained. Compared to free heme, Heme-ZrMOF could efficiently achieve the easy separation of heme from the catalytic system and facilitate the ATRP reaction in an aqueous environment to avoid the utilization of organic solvents. In conclusion, the enzyme mimic Heme-ZrMOF could be potentially used as an effective catalyst for preparing well-defined polymers with biomedical applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3acatalysts 3acoordination polymers 3aenzyme activity 3aheme 3amolecular weight 3aperoxidase 3apolymerization 3asolvents 0aPeroxidase mimic 0aMetal-organic frameworks 0aHeme 0aAtom transfer radical polymerization 0aPolymer synthesis1 aPan, Yue1 aYang, Jiebing1 aLiu, Yong1 aYang, Yan1 aTang, Jun1 aLi, Quanshun0 tJournal of colloid and interface science.g2018 July 01, v. 521 p.62-68dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12461x0021-97977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcis.2018.03.0253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02939naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245018800171300001400359520138300373592002801756650001701784650001401801650002501815650003201840650002301872650001001895650001601905650002001921650001101941650003301952650002001985650001602005650001802021653002002039653001102059653003302070653002602103653003002129700001302159700001702172700001902189700001502208700001702223773011002240856008602350852000902436655001202445IND60531729720221120204406.0180904e201611  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053172972DNAL7 a10.1016/j.molcatb.2016.07.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Yuanyuan10aOne-pot stereoselective synthesis of chiral 1, 3-oxathiolane by Trichosporon laibachii lipase: Optimization by response surface methodology integrated a desirability function approach  ap. 27-34.  aThe asymmetric synthesis of chiral 1,3-oxathiolan-5-ones has attracted a great deal of attention owing to their broad biological activities and importance as intermediates for a range of useful pharmaceuticals. However, the enantiomeric purity of desired enantiomer was moderate while maintaining high yield. Here, high enantiomerically pure chiral 1,3-oxathiolane intermediate was synthesized by cyclization-acetylation reaction in organic media using immobilized Trichosporon laibachii (T. laibachii) lipase with one-pot process. Response surface methodology (RSM) integrated a desirability function approach was used to study and optimize the reaction conditions. The effects of several reaction parameters (initial water content of reaction medium, lipase amount and reaction temperature) on enantiomeric excess (ee) and the conversion of benzoyl aldehyde (C) were evaluated. The enzyme activity as well as enantioselectivity was markedly influenced by the initial water content of reaction medium and reaction temperature. The maximum overall desirability (D) of 0.958 was achieved at initial water content of 0.46%, lipase amount of 4.58% and reaction temperature 43°C. The corresponding maximum ee and C were 94.33% and 97.40%, respectively. A good correlation between the predicted and actual responses showed that the generated model could adequately predict ee and C.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTrichosporon 3aaldehydes 3abioactive properties 3acarboxylic ester hydrolases 3acatalytic activity 3adrugs 3aenantiomers 3aenzyme activity 3amodels 3aresponse surface methodology 3astereochemistry 3atemperature 3awater content 0a1,3-Oxathiolane 0aLipase 0aResponse surface methodology 0aDesirability function 0aStereoselective synthesis1 aGao, Xin1 aWang, Caiyun1 aZheng, Zhenkun1 aWang, Lulu1 aLiu, Junhong0 tJournal of molecular catalysis.g2016 Nov., v. 133 p.27-34dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12410x1381-11777nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.molcatb.2016.07.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03124naa a2200649 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005500148245007800203300001600281520114400297592002801441650004401469650002201513650002101535650001501556650000801571650001201579650002101591650001101612650001901623650002001642650002001662650001701682650003801699650001701737650000901754650001401763650001301777650003301790650003301823650001301856650001901869650001701888650002401905650002101929650002501950653003901975653001202014653001602026653002102042653002202063653001602085700001702101700005402118700002302172700001902195700001702214700001502231773012502246856008202371852000902453655001202462IND60628887220221123034558.0190131e20180701xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062888722DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcis.2018.03.0272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMa, Xiaowei1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9601-309X10aRole of CuO in improving NH3 and SO2 capture on nanoporous Fe2O3 sorbents  ap. 206-215.  aIn this work, mixed Fe/Cu oxides as sorbents for SO2 and NH3 removal were investigated. Nanoporous iron oxide mixed with 10, 20 and 30 at.% CuO were prepared by thermal decomposition of the corresponding oxalates at 250 °C for 5 h in air. The mixed Fe/Cu oxalates were obtained from the co-precipitation of iron/copper sulfate and ammonium oxalate during ultrasonication. The physical properties of the oxalate precursors and the resulting mixed Fe/Cu oxides were characterized with SEM, TGA-DSC, FTIR, powder XRD and Mössbauer spectroscopy. The porosity was studied by N2 adsorption-desorption isotherms and small angle X-ray scattering. Evenly dispersed CuO hindered the crystallization of Fe2O3, which significantly increased the specific BET surface area from 211 m2/g for Fe2O3 to 354 m2/g for Fe0.8Cu0.2Ox. As a result, SO2 and NH3 adsorption on Fe0.8Cu0.2Ox were enhanced by about 70% compared to Fe2O3. Compared to Fe2O3-impregnated activated carbons, nanoporous Fe0.8Cu0.2Ox could capture five times more SO2 per unit weight, which will be attractive for applications in respirators with lower weight and smaller size.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aX-ray diffraction 3aactivated carbon 3aadsorption 3aair 3aammonia 3aammonium oxalate 3acopper 3acopper sulfate 3acoprecipitation 3acrystallization 3acupric oxide 3adifferential scanning calorimetry 3aferric oxide 3airon 3ananopores 3aporosity 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asmall-angle X-ray scattering 3asorbents 3asulfur dioxide 3asurface area 3athermal degradation 3athermogravimetry 3aultrasonic treatment 0aNanoporous iron-copper mixed oxide 0aOxalate 0aCalcination 0aBET surface area 0aDynamic flow test 0aRespirators1 aZhao, Xiuyun1 aLiu, Aaron1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8797-95701 aRankin, Matthew A.1 aCroll, Lisa M.1 aDunlap, R.A.1 aDahn, J.R.0 tJournal of colloid and interface science.g2018 July 01, v. 521 p.206-215dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12461x0021-97977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcis.2018.03.0273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04183naa a2200733 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002200092024001900114024003300133040001800166100002400184245008700208300001200295500001500307506007600322520193200398592002802330506003702358650001902395650001502414650002702429650002302456650001202479650001902491650002502510650002002535650001302555650002502568650001602593650002102609650001102630650001202641650002302653650001202676650004102688650002002729650004202749650001102791650001902802650003202821650001002853650002602863650003002889650003202919650001702951650002602968651001302994651002803007653001603035700002303051700002103074700002503095700002103120700002303141700002403164700002403188700002403212773011203236856008003348852000903428655001203437IND4492746420221207134252.0190823e201212  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND449274642DNAL7 aPMC34253292pmcid7 a227415512pmid7 a10.1186/1756-3305-5-1292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLowassa, Asanterabi10aSocial economic factors and malaria transmission in Lower Moshi, Northern Tanzania  ap. 129.  a2019-12-04  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: For many years social economic status has been used as an indicator to characterize malaria treatment seeking behaviors of communities and their adherence to malaria control programs. The present study was therefore conducted to assess the influence of household social economic status, knowledge, attitude and practice on treatment seeking behaviors, distance to health facilities and vector control measures in the Lower Moshi area, northern Tanzania. METHODS: A cross-sectional household survey was carried out, a quantitative method was used to collect information from the households, and the household socio-economic status was estimated by employing a household asset-based approach. The structured questionnaire also collected information on malaria knowledge, attitudes and treatment seeking behaviors. RESULTS: A total of 197 (68.8% were female) household heads were interviewed. Distance to the health centers influenced malaria treatment seeking behaviors especially for children (P = 0.001) and the number of visits to the health facilities made by the household members (P = 0.001). The head of the households' level of education had an influence on bed-net retreatment (P < 0.001) and acceptability of larval control programmes (P <0.001). Similarly, a significant association was observed between bed-net retreatment, larval control and occupation of the head of the household . CONCLUSION: Distance to the health centre influenced malaria treatment seeking behaviors, and the number of visits made by the household members. In addition, the education level of the household heads played a role in understanding and in the selection of malaria interventions for the households. Increasing the number of health facilities close to rural areas will improve malaria treatment seeking behavior, case management and hence reduce malaria-associated morbidities, especially in high risk groups.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aquestionnaires 3ahouseholds 3aattitudes and opinions 3aat-risk population 3asurveys 3avector control 3adisease transmission 3acontrol methods 3achildren 3asocioeconomic status 3arural areas 3aeconomic factors 3alarvae 3amalaria 3aeducational status 2aAnimals 2aAnophelesxparasitologyxphysiology. 2aData Collection 2aHealth Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice 2aHumans 2aInsect Vectors 2aInsecticide-Treated Bednets 2aLarva 2aMalariaxtransmission 2aMosquito Controlxmethods 2aSurveys and Questionnaires. 2aRisk Factors 2aSocioeconomic Factors 3aTanzania 0aTanzaniaxepidemiology. 0arisk groups1 aMazigo, Humphrey D1 aMahande, Aneth M1 aMwang’onde, Beda J1 aMsangi, Shandala1 aMahande, Michael J1 aKimaro, Epiphania E1 aElisante, Eliapenda1 aKweka, Eliningaya J0 tParasites & vectors.g2012 Dec., v. 5, no. 1 p.129-129dBioMed CentralwJournal:jnl4347486x1756-33057nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1756-3305-5-1293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03329naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100003100140245018800171500001900359520188800378592002802266650001802294650002002312650001602332650002602348650001802374650001202392650000902404650001302413650001902426650002402445650001802469700002402487700002802511700002102539700002902560700003502589700002902624700003702653773012202690856007402812852000902886655001202895IND60732163220221121000155.0210326e20210305xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073216322DNAL7 a10.3390/nu130308582doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aten Haaf, Dominique  S. M.14aThe Effect of Protein Supplementation versus Carbohydrate Supplementation on Muscle Damage Markers and Soreness Following a 15-km Road Race: A Double-Blind Randomized Controlled Trial  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aWe assessed whether a protein supplementation protocol could attenuate running-induced muscle soreness and other muscle damage markers compared to iso-caloric placebo supplementation. A double-blind randomized controlled trial was performed among 323 recreational runners (age 44 ± 11 years, 56% men) participating in a 15-km road race. Participants received milk protein or carbohydrate supplementation, for three consecutive days post-race. Habitual protein intake was assessed using 24 h recalls. Race characteristics were determined and muscle soreness was assessed with the Brief Pain Inventory at baseline and 1–3 days post-race. In a subgroup (n = 149) muscle soreness was measured with a strain gauge algometer and creatine kinase (CK) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) concentrations were measured. At baseline, no group-differences were observed for habitual protein intake (protein group: 79.9 ± 26.5 g/d versus placebo group: 82.0 ± 26.8 g/d, p = 0.49) and muscle soreness (protein: 0.45 ± 1.08 versus placebo: 0.44 ± 1.14, p = 0.96). Subjects completed the race with a running speed of 12 ± 2 km/h. With the Intention-to-Treat analysis no between-group differences were observed in reported muscle soreness. With the per-protocol analysis, however, the protein group reported higher muscle soreness 24 h post-race compared to the placebo group (2.96 ± 2.27 versus 2.46 ± 2.38, p = 0.039) and a lower pressure muscle pain threshold in the protein group compared to the placebo group (71.8 ± 30.0 N versus 83.9 ± 27.9 N, p = 0.019). No differences were found in concentrations of CK and LDH post-race between groups. Post-exercise protein supplementation is not more preferable than carbohydrate supplementation to reduce muscle soreness or other damage markers in recreational athletes with mostly a sufficient baseline protein intake running a 15-km road race.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbohydrates 3acreatine kinase 3ainventories 3alactate dehydrogenase 3amilk proteins 3amuscles 3apain 3aplacebos 3aprotein intake 3aprotein supplements 3astrain gauges1 aFlipsen, Martin  A.1 aHorstman, Astrid  M.

However, there are challenges related to color fading during food processing, storage, and commercialization due to the low stability of natural colorants compared to synthetic ones. Among them, anthocyanins are potential food colorants due to their color, low toxicity, and biological properties. However, the low chemical and thermal stability of anthocyanins have limited their use on a commercial scale. Copigmentation is the most commonly used technique for anthocyanin stabilization. This technique provides many advantages associated with the stability of anthocyanins. Natural anthocyanin pigments and copigments (e.g. polymers, phenolic compounds, and carbohydrates) form non-covalent complexes, which stabilize and modulate colors in a wide range of plants, fruits, and food products derived from them (including wines, jams, purees, and syrups). Over the past decade, research studies have been conducted to understand the molecular structure of copigment and the mechanism of copigmentation. This review summarizes this phenomenon to provide a comprehensive description of the interactions between anthocyanin and copigment (the dispersion and electrostatic components of π − π stacking, the hydrophobic effect, and hydrogen-bonding) occurring in copigmentation complexes. The trend of integrating copigmentation and encapsulation has been recently started to develop. In this paper, we also attempt to provide a comprehensive view of the effective approaches including spray and freeze-drying, emulsification, gelation, and their combinations for encapsulating copigmented anthocyanins.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aanthocyanins 3abetalains 3acarotenoids 3achemical structure 3acolor 3acommercialization 3aemulsifying 3aencapsulation 3afood industry 3afreeze drying 3agelation 3ahydrogen bonding 3ahydrophobicity 3athermal stability 3atoxicity 0aCopigment 0aCopigment interactions 0aAnthocyanin stability 0aEncapsulation 0aColor stability 0aAnthocyanin stabilization1 aÖzdemir, Elif Ezgi1 aDemirci, Kardelen1 aGörgüç, Ahmet1 aYılmaz, Fatih Mehmet0 tCurrent plant biology.g2022 Jan., v. 29 p.100238-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23302x2214-66287nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cpb.2022.1002383Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03550naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100003600147245006200183300001100245500001900256520222900275592002802504596007302532650001502605650000802620650001502628650001802643650001902661650002302680650001902703650001202722651001102734700003402745700002902779700003302808700003102841700006902872773010802941856008203049852000903131655001203140IND60712629420221119224648.0210731e202012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071262942DNAL7 a10.1186/s12985-020-1291-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 ade Souza, Gabriel Augusto Pires10aVirus goes viral: an educational kit for virology classes  ap. 13.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aBACKGROUND: Viruses are the most numerous entities on Earth and have also been central to many episodes in the history of humankind. As the study of viruses progresses further and further, there are several limitations in transferring this knowledge to undergraduate and high school students. This deficiency is due to the difficulty in designing hands-on lessons that allow students to better absorb content, given limited financial resources and facilities, as well as the difficulty of exploiting viral particles, due to their small dimensions. The development of tools for teaching virology is important to encourage educators to expand on the covered topics and connect them to recent findings. Discoveries, such as giant DNA viruses, have provided an opportunity to explore aspects of viral particles in ways never seen before. Coupling these novel findings with techniques already explored by classical virology, including visualization of cytopathic effects on permissive cells, may represent a new way for teaching virology. This work aimed to develop a slide microscope kit that explores giant virus particles and some aspects of animal virus interaction with cell lines, with the goal of providing an innovative approach to virology teaching. METHODS: Slides were produced by staining, with crystal violet, purified giant viruses and BSC-40 and Vero cells infected with viruses of the genera Orthopoxvirus, Flavivirus, and Alphavirus. Slides with amoebae infected with different species of giant viruses and stained with hemacolor reagents were also produced. RESULTS: Staining of the giant viruses allowed better visualization of the viral particles, and this technique highlights the diversity in morphology and sizes among them. Hemacolor staining enabled visualization of viral factories in amoebae, and the staining of infected BSC-40 and Vero cell monolayers with crystal violet highlights plaque-forming units. CONCLUSIONS: This kit was used in practical virology classes for the Biological Sciences course (UFMG, Brazil), and it will soon be made available at a low-cost for elementary school teachers in institutions that have microscopes. We hope this tool will foster an inspiring learning environment.  aPublisher supplied data  a001cConselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico 3aAlphavirus 3aDNA 3aFlavivirus 3aOrthopoxvirus 3aanimal viruses 3aelementary schools 3agentian violet 3aviruses 3aBrazil1 aQueiroz, Victória Fulgêncio1 aLima, Maurício Teixeira1 ade Sousa Reis, Erik Vinicius1 aCoelho, Luiz Felipe Leomil1 aAbrahão, Jônatas Santos1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9420-17910 tVirology journal.g2020 Dec., v. 17, no. 1 p.13-13dBioMed CentralwJournal:J000001738x1743-422X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12985-020-1291-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01773naa a2200277 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004400092040001800136100002200154245005600176300001500232520092900247592002801176650000901204650001101213650001501224650001401239651001401253700002301267773012701290856005701417852000901474655001201483IND4473480420221119091141.0120727e198401  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447348042DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1095-8339.1984.tb01565.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKOVACH, WARREN L.10aDispersed cuticles from the Eocene of North America  ap. 63-104.  aKOVACH, W. L. & DILCHER, D. L., 1984. Dispersed cuticles from the Eocene of North America. Macerations of organic‐rich clay from the Claiborne Formation (Middle Eocene) of Tennessee have yielded a wide variety of well‐preserved dispersed cuticles. Details of the epidermal cell patterns, arrangement of the stomata1 complex, trichomes and trichome attachment have made possible the association of some dispersed cuticles with leaf types known from this formation which have similar cuticle, and with modern families. All dispersed cuticles are classified in a morphologic system. Through both our own work and a review of previous investigations we have found that distinct dispersed cuticle types can be recognized and may be used biostratigraphically to characterize geologic strata, palaeo‐ecologically to provide insights into environmental reconstruction, and systematically to follow the history of certain taxa.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclay 3aleaves 3amaceration 3atrichomes 3aTennessee1 aDilcher, David L.,0 tBotanical journal of the Linnean Society.g1984 Jan., v. 88, no. 1‐2 p.63-104dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0024-40747nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1095-8339.1984.tb01565.x  aDNAL 7aarticle03855naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002800140245008800168500001900256520222400275592002802499650003102527650001202558650001502570650001202585650001302597650001102610650001502621650001802636650001902654650001702673650003002690650001502720650001602735650001702751650000902768650001702777650002102794650001002815650001202825650003002837650001702867650002202884650002902906700002202935700002602957700002202983700002503005700002703030700002703057773012203084856007403206852000903280655001203289IND60732163420221120224618.0210326e20210305xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073216342DNAL7 a10.3390/nu130308552doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLitvinova, Ekaterina A.10aDietary Fucose Affects Macrophage Polarization and Reproductive Performance in Mice  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aIntestinal mucus protects epithelial and immune cells from the gut resident microorganisms, and provides growth-promoting factors as mucus-derived O-glycans for beneficial bacteria. A lack of intestinal protective mucus results in changes in the commensal microflora composition, mucosal immune system reprogramming, and inflammation. Previous work has shown that fucose, the terminal glycan chain component of the intestinal glycoprotein Mucin2, and fucoidan polysaccharides have an anti-inflammatory effect in some mouse models of colitis. This study evaluates the effect of fucose on reproductive performance in heterozygous mutant Muc2 female mice. We found that even though Muc2⁺/⁻ females are physiologically indistinguishable from C57Bl/6 mice, they have a significantly reduced reproductive performance upon dietary fucose supplementation. Metagenomic analysis reveals that the otherwise healthy wild-type siblings of Muc2⁻/⁻ animals have reduced numbers of some of the intestinal commensal bacterial species, compared to C57BL/6 mice. We propose that the changes in beneficial microflora affect the immune status in Muc2⁺/⁻ mice, which causes implantation impairment. In accordance with this hypothesis, we find that macrophage polarization during pregnancy is impaired in Muc2⁺/⁻ females upon addition of fucose. Metabolic profiling of peritoneal macrophages from Muc2⁺/⁻ females reveals their predisposition towards anaerobic glycolysis in favor of oxidative phosphorylation, compared to C57BL/6-derived cells. In vitro experiments on phagocytosis activity and mitochondrial respiration suggest that fucose affects oxidative phosphorylation in a genotype-specific manner, which might interfere with implantation depending on the initial status of macrophages. This hypothesis is further confirmed in BALB/c female mice, where fucose caused pregnancy loss and opposed implantation-associated M2 macrophage polarization. Taken together, these data suggest that intestinal microflora affects host immunity and pregnancy outcome. At the same time, dietary fucose might act as a differential regulator of macrophage polarization during implantation, depending on the immune status of the host.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanti-inflammatory activity 3acolitis 3aepithelium 3afemales 3afucoidan 3afucose 3aglycolysis 3aglycoproteins 3aheterozygosity 3ainflammation 3aintestinal microorganisms 3aintestines 3amacrophages 3ametagenomics 3amice 3amitochondria 3amucosal immunity 3amucus 3amutants 3aoxidative phosphorylation 3aphagocytosis 3apregnancy outcome 3areproductive performance1 aBets, Victoria D.1 aFeofanova, Natalya A.1 aGvozdeva, Olga V.1 aAchasova, Kseniya M.1 aAlperina, Elizaveta L.1 aKozhevnikova, Elena N.0 tNutrients.g2021 Mar. 05, v. 13, no. 3dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2271x2072-66437nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/nu130308553Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01584naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001300149245008300162300001400245500001900259520040400278592002800682650001300710650001000723650001300733650001600746651001000762653001900772653002300791653002600814653001000840653001300850700002500863700002000888700001500908700001700923700001500940700001800955773009600973856008401069852000901153655001201162IND60716593020221120223533.0210531e20201029xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071659302DNAL7 a10.3897/phytokeys.166.576722doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Meng10aRe-instatement of Sorbus harrowiana (Rosaceae), based on morphometric analysis  ap. 29-39.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aSorbus harrowiana (≡Pyrus harrowiana), previously considered a synonym of Sorbus insignis (≡Pyrus insignis) in the Flora of China, is re-instated here and shown to be distinct from S. insignis, based on morphometric analysis, coupled with herbarium and field investigation.

Small, isolated populations are prone to losing functional alleles due to demographic processes and genetic drift, which may diminish their ability to resist infection if immune genes are affected. Demographic processes may also alter the selective pressure exerted by a parasite, as they influence the rate of parasite transmission between individuals. In the present paper we studied changes in parasite infection levels and genetic variability in an isolated population of spotted suslik (Spermophillus suslicus). Over a three-year period (approx. three generations), when the population size remained relatively stable, we observed a considerable increase in parasite prevalence and infection intensity, followed by the development of novel associations between MHC DRB alleles and parasite burden. Contrary to expectations, the change in MHC allele frequency over time was not consistent with the effect of the allele – for instance, Spsu-DRB*07, associated with higher intensity of infection with a nematode Capillaria sp., increased in frequency from 11.8 to 20.2%. Yet, we found no signatures of selection in the studied loci. Our results show that an isolated, stable population may experience a sudden increase in parasitic infections, resulting in a development of novel associations between MHC alleles and parasite susceptibility/resistance, even though no signatures of selection can be found.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCapillaria 3aSpermophilus suslicus 3aalleles 3aendangered species 3agene frequency 3agenetic drift 3agenetic variation 3aloci 3amammals 3anematode infections 3aparasites 3apathogens 3apopulation size 0aMHC 0aParasites 0aIsolated population 0aEndangered species 0aParasite-driven selection1 aKloch, Agnieszka0 tInfection, genetics, and evolution.g2016 Oct., v. 44 p.210-217dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12450x1567-13487nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.meegid.2016.07.0143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02922naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003600111040001800147100002400165245007900189300001600268520127600284592002801560650000901588650001701597650001801614650001101632650001201643650001901655650001501674650001401689650002101703650001401724650001901738650001401757650005801771650001201829650003901841650000901880650001101889650002201900650000901922650002701931653001101958653002401969653001101993653001202004653001802016653002502034700002102059700002102080700001902101773013202120852000902252856008302261655001202344IND4371044820221116220716.0181016e200505  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437104482DNAL7 a159453772pmid7 a10.1177/1040638705017003022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMorrow, Carla M.

All dogs had degeneration or necrosis (or both) of proximal renal tubules with basement membranes remaining intact, and epithelial regeneration was observed in 5 out of 10 cases. Mineralized tubular debris or granular to proteinaceous casts (or both) were present in all cases. A golden-brown, globular, intracellular pigment of varying amounts and sizes was observed in 6 out of 10 cases with variable reaction with Prussian blue. Multifocal fibrinous arteritis of the large colon was seen in 2 out of 5 cases with globulin insudation of vessel wall demonstrated by immunohistochemical staining for immunoglobulin (Ig)G and IgM. Mineral analysis on frozen renal tissue from 2 out of 2 cases revealed mildly elevated Ca:P ratio in both. Clinically significant observations were preservation of the integrity of basement membranes after grape-induced tubular injury and presence of early epithelial regeneration. Thus, recovery may be possible if anuria is aggressively managed. With respect to potential pathophysiologic mechanisms, further research into the roles of calcium homeostasis, vascular reactivity, and the significance of the golden-brown pigment is indicated.  aPublisher supplied data 3adogs 3adog diseases 3arenal failure 3agrapes 3araisins 3anephrotoxicity 3abiomarkers 3apoisoning 3adietary exposure 3aingestion 3ahistopathology 3aarteritis 2aAcute Kidney Injuryxetiologyxpathologyxveterinary. 2aAnimals 2aDog Diseasesxetiologyxpathology. 2aDogs 2aFemale 2aKidneyxpathology 2aMale 2aVitisxadverse effects 0aCanine 0afibrinous arteritis 0agrapes 0araisins 0arenal failure 0arenal mineralization1 aValli, Victor E.1 aVolmer, Petra A.1 aEubig, Paul A.0 tJournal of veterinary diagnostic investigation.g, v. 17, no. 3 p.223-231dSAGE PublicationswJournal:jnl43656x1040-63877nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1040638705017003023Available from publisher's site 7aarticle03673naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100005900150245010800209300001600317506011700333506007600450520186600526592002802392506003702420650002102457650001202478650002102490650001702511650002002528650001602548650002202564650002302586650002102609650001002630650002002640650001902660650001602679650001502695653001602710653001602726653002302742653001702765653002102782700002402803700002202827700002202849700002202871700001802893700002102911773009302932856008503025852000903110655001203119IND60767278020221207121541.0220321s2022    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076727802DNAL7 a10.1016/j.toxrep.2022.02.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGerzilov, Vasko1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7537-381110aEffect of prooxidants and chelator Desferal on the oxidative status and sperm motility of Muscovy semen  ap. 276-283.  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThis study aimed to establish the sensitivity of Muscovy duck semen to oxidative stress (OS) and the effect of Desferal, applied as an antioxidant. The effect of three prooxidant systems in presence and absence of Desferal were tested on the motility and kinetic parameters (determined using CASA system), as well as the level of lipid peroxidation (LPO) and glutathione (tGSH) of Muscovy semen. The semen was diluted (1:3 v/v) with four extenders (saline solution, IMV Canadyl, HIA-1, and AU) and stored at 4 °C for 6 h. The cooled semen was divided into aliquots (50 × 10⁶ sperm cells/mL), which were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min with one of the following prooxidative agents: ferrous sulfate (FeSO₄, 0.1 mM), hydrogen peroxide (H₂O₂, 1 mM), and Fenton system (FeSO₄(Fe²⁺), 0.1 mM + H₂O₂, 1 mM), in the presence or absence of Desferal (0.1 mM). The addition of FeSO₄ + H₂O₂ or FeSO₄ regardless of the used extender, as well as the addition of H₂O₂ to the diluted semen with saline solution significantly increased the levels of LPO (P < 0.05). With the lowest prooxidant effect was H₂O₂. The application of Desferal reduced significantly (P < 0.05) the LPO levels induced by FeSO₄ + H₂O₂ or FeSO₄ and in a weaker degree by H₂O₂. Among all prooxidants, FeSO₄ + H₂O₂ decreased in the greatest extent the tGSH concentration in semen diluted with each used extenders in comparison to the relevant control. The addition of Desferal in semen diluted with HIA-1 extender and incubated with FeSO₄, and H₂O₂, showed the best restoration of tGSH level, close to that of respectively controls. The studied prooxidants significantly reduced total, progressive, and kinetic sperm motility (P < 0.05). Although the inclusion of Desferal reduced the sperm OS, it did not improve the impaired by OS sperm motility.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aCairina moschata 3aMuscovy 3achelating agents 3adeferoxamine 3aferrous sulfate 3aglutathione 3ahydrogen peroxide 3alipid peroxidation 3aoxidative stress 3asemen 3asodium chloride 3asperm motility 3aspermatozoa 3atoxicology 0aAvian semen 0aGlutathione 0aLipid peroxidation 0aMuscovy duck 0aOxidative stress1 aAlexandrova, Albena1 aAndreeva, Madlena1 aTsvetanova, Elina1 aGeorgieva, Almira1 aPetrov, Petar1 aStefanov, Rossen0 tToxicology reports.g2022, v. 9 p.276-283dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23254x2214-75007nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.toxrep.2022.02.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02997naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003800113040001800151100002000169245011900189300001800308520125700326592002801583650002501611650000801636650003501644650001201679650000901691650000901700650001301709650001201722650002601734650001101760650001801771650001301789650001801802650001201820650001101832650002501843650002901868650001401897650002301911650002901934650002201963651001101985651001101996653002202007653001902029653001702048653001702065653003202082653001202114700002202126700002402148700002102172773013002193856005102323852000902374655001202383IND50076431120221122034437.0140410e20121001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007643112DNAL7 a227555312pmid7 a10.1080/10934529.2012.6895492doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBoryło, Alicja10aPolonium (210Po), uranium (234U, 238U) isotopes and trace metals in mosses from Sobieszewo Island, northern Poland  ap. 1831-1842.  aThe activity of polonium ²¹⁰Po and uranium ²³⁴U, ²³⁸U radionuclides, as well as trace metals in mosses, collected from Sobieszewo Island area (northern Poland), were determined using the alpha spectrometry, AAS (atomic absorption spectrometry) and OES-ICP (atomic emission spectrometry with inductively coupled plasma). The concentrations of mercury (directly from the solid sample) were determined by the cold vapor technique of CV AAS. The obtained results revealed that the concentrations of ²¹⁰Po, ²³⁴U, and ²³⁸U in the two analyzed kinds of mosses: schrebers big red stem moss (Pleurozium schreberi) and broom moss (Dicranum scoparium) were similar. The higher polonium concentrations were found in broom moss (Dicranum scoparium), but uranium concentrations were relatively low for both species of analyzed mosses. Among the analyzed trace metals the highest concentration in mosses was recorded for iron, while the lowest for nickel, cadmium and mercury. The obtained studies showed that the sources of polonium and uranium isotopes, as well as trace metals in analyzed mosses are air city contaminations transported from Gdańsk and from existing in the vicinity the phosphogypsum waste heap in Wiślinka (near Gdańsk).  aPublisher supplied data 3aPleurozium schreberi 3aair 3aatomic absorption spectrometry 3acadmium 3acold 3airon 3aisotopes 3amercury 3amosses and liverworts 3anickel 3aphosphogypsum 3apolonium 3aradionuclides 3auranium 3avapors 2aBryophytaxchemistry 2aEnvironmental Monitoring 2aGeography 2aPoloniumxanalysis 2aTrace Elementsxanalysis 2aUraniumxanalysis 3aPoland 0aPoland 0aSobieszewo Island 0apolonium 210Po 0auranium 234U 0auranium 238U 0atrace metals, concentration 0amosses.1 aNowicki, Waldemar1 aOlszewski, Grzegorz1 aSkwarzec, Bogdan0 tJournal of environmental science and health.g2012 Oct. 1, v. 47, no. 12 p.1831-1842dTaylor & Francis Groupx1532-41177nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10934529.2012.689549  aDNAL 7aarticle01992naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245007600158300001600234520103800250592002801288650002501316650002101341650001901362650002001381650002501401650001101426650001001437700002101447700002201468773010101490856004101591961001301632852000901645655001201654IND50073644720221119091248.0140305e201403  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007364472DNAL7 a10.1111/agec.120422doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPark, Timothy10aDo farm operators benefit from direct to consumer marketing strategies?  ap. 213-224.  aUsing farm‐level data this study investigates factors associated with the choice of three direct marketing strategies (DMSs). Particular attention is given to the role of management and marketing skills in selection of DMSs. Additionally, the study applies a selectivity‐based approach for the multinomial logit model to assess the relationship between DMSs and the financial performance of the business. Results suggest that both management and marketing skills significantly affect direct‐to‐consumer sales. Farmers choosing the strategy of sales only through direct‐to‐consumer outlets report earnings that are significantly lower than earnings from the other marketing strategies. Marketing skills prove to be beneficial to direct‐to‐consumer (DTC) earnings. Finally, the selectivity correction terms in the direct sales model are significantly negative in the choice of DTC, indicating the presence of sample selection effects. Accounting for selectivity is essential to ensure unbiased and consistent estimates.  aPublisher supplied data 3abusiness enterprises 3adirect marketing 3afarm operators 3afarming systems 3amarketing strategies 3amodels 3asales1 aMishra, Ashok K.1 aWozniak, Shawn J.0 tAgricultural economics.g2014 Mar., v. 45, no. 2 p.213-224dElsevier Science BVx0169-51507nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/agec.12042  aUSDA/ERS  aDNAL 7aarticle02276naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003600111040001800147100001400165245007900179300001600258520078900274592002801063650002201091650001201113650002001125650002601145650001201171650003001183650002801213650002101241650001201262650001101274650002601285650006301311650001201374653002501386653001701411653003901428653001201467700001601479700001301495700001501508700001801523700001701541773013201558852000901690856008301699655001201782IND4371052320221116220907.0181016e200505  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437105232DNAL7 a159453832pmid7 a10.1177/1040638705017003082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPeris, B.10aPneumatosis Cystoides Intestinalis in a Rabbit Doe (Oryctolagus Cuniculus)  ap. 256-258.  aPneumatosis cystoides intestinalis (PCI) is an infrequent condition of animals characterized by the existence of numerous thin-walled, gas-filled cystic structures within the intestinal wall and adjacent lymph nodes. Microscopically, the cystic structures appear to be dilated lymphatics located in the lamina propria, submucosa, muscularis, subserosa, mesentery, and mesenteric lymph nodes. This report describes a case of pneumatosis cystoides intestinalis in a rabbit doe from an organic farm where 20 rabbit does were fed ad libitum with a natural diet consisting of whole barley, pea beans, alfalfa hay, and a pelleted vitamin–mineral blend. A combination of nutritional, bacterial, and other factors are hypothesized as possible predisposing factors in the development of PCI.  aPublisher supplied data 3acysts (pathology) 3arabbits 3arabbit diseases 3aOryctolagus cuniculus 3afemales 3adigestive system diseases 3agastrointestinal system 3aanimal nutrition 2aAnimals 2aFemale 2aIntestinesxpathology 2aPneumatosis Cystoides Intestinalisxpathologyxveterinary. 2aRabbits 0aIntestinal emphysema 0aorganic farm 0apneumatosis cystoides intestinalis 0arabbits1 aGarcía, V.1 aBlas, E.1 aSegura, P.1 aMartínez, J.1 aCorpa, J.

The morphological structure, wettability and physicochemical properties of the adsorbents were thoroughly characterized using SEM, EDS, N2-adsorption/desorption isotherm, static contact angle, XRD and FTIR. Results elucidated that SDS and AM were successfully introduced into the interlayer and onto the layer of LDH, respectively. Adsorption experimental results suggested that the maximum adsorption capacities of CR on SDS-LDH and AM/SDS-LDH at pH 5.0 and 293 K were 714.29 and 1118.78 mg/g, respectively, which were much higher than that of CR on LDH (588.24 mg/g). Based on the BET, XRD and FTIR analysis, the higher adsorption capacity of AM/SDS-LDH was mainly attributed to high surface area, large basal spacing as well as the abundant NH2 groups. The experimental data can be well fitted by pseudo-second-order kinetic and Langmuir isotherm models. Thermodynamic parameters indicated the adsorption process was favorable under the higher temperature condition. The synergistic effect existed during the adsorption process of CR onto AM/SDS-LDH, including the electrostatic interactions, anion exchange and hydrophobic-hydrophobic interactions. Overall, this study provided a strategy for design and fabrication of highly efficient adsorbents.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aX-ray diffraction 3aacrylamides 3aadsorbents 3aadsorption 3aanion exchange 3acontact angle 3aelectrostatic interactions 3aenergy-dispersive X-ray analysis 3ahydroxides 3amodels 3apH 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asodium dodecyl sulfate 3asorption isotherms 3asurface area 3asynergism 3atemperature 3athermodynamics 3awettability 0aLayered double hydroxides 0aSodium dodecyl sulfate 0aAcrylamide 0aCongo red adsorption 0aInteraction mechanism1 aZeng, Hanxuan1 aShi, Zhou1 aZhang, Wen1 aLuo, Jinming0 tJournal of colloid and interface science.g2018 July 01, v. 521 p.172-182dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12461x0021-97977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcis.2018.03.0403Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03368naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002400149245013500173300001600308520178200324592002802106650001702134650001902151650001102170650001502181650001602196650002102212650001002233650001702243650002002260650001302280650001602293650001502309650001202324650002202336653001702358653001802375653001302393653003202406653003802438653001402476700002702490700001902517700003302536700001902569700002502588700002602613773010602639856008402745852000902829655001202838IND60531730620221122222225.0180905e20170116xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053173062DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jprot.2016.07.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCaruso, Marjolly B.10aProteomic analysis of the secretome of HepG2 cells indicates differential proteolytic processing after infection with dengue virus  ap. 106-113.  aSecretome analysis can be described as a subset of proteomics studies consisting in the analysis of the molecules secreted by cells or tissues. Dengue virus (DENV) infection can lead to a broad spectrum of clinical manifestations, with the severe forms of the disease characterized by hemostasis abnormalities and liver injury. The hepatocytes are a relevant site of viral replication and a major source of plasma proteins. Until now, we had limited information on the small molecules secreted by hepatic cells after infection by DENV. In the present study, we analysed a fraction of the secretome of mock- and DENV-infected hepatic cells (HepG2 cells) containing molecules with <10kDa, using different proteomic approaches. We identified 175 proteins, with 57 detected only in the samples from mock-infected cells, 59 only in samples from DENV-infected cells, and 59 in both conditions. Most of the peptides identified were derived from proteins larger than 10kDa, suggesting a proteolytic processing of the secreted molecules. Using in silico analysis, we predicted consistent differences between the proteolytic processing occurring in mock and DENV-infected samples, raising, for the first time, the hypothesis that differential proteolysis of secreted molecules would be involved in the pathogenesis of dengue.Since the liver, one of the targets of DENV infection, is responsible for producing molecules involved in distinct biological processes, the identification of proteins and peptides secreted by hepatocytes after infection would help to a better understanding of the physiopathology of dengue. Proteomic analyses of molecules with <10kDa secreted by HepG2 cells after infection with DENV revealed differential proteolytic processing as an effect of DENV infection.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDengue virus 3ablood proteins 3adengue 3ahemostasis 3ahepatocytes 3ahuman cell lines 3aliver 3apathogenesis 3apathophysiology 3apeptides 3aproteolysis 3aproteomics 3atissues 3avirus replication 0aDengue virus 0aHepatic cells 0aProteome 0aLow molecular mass proteins 0aPrediction of proteolytic enzymes 0aSecretome1 aTrugilho, Monique R.O.1 aHiga, Luiza M.1 aTeixeira-Ferreira, André S.1 aPerales, Jonas1 aPoian, Andrea T.

In the current research, novel catalysts with palladium nanoparticles (Pd NPs) supported on the hollow mesoporous silica nanotubes (h-mSiO2) were synthesized for the catalytic reduction of 4-nitrophenol (4-NP) and hydrodechlorination (HDC) of 4-chlorophenol (4-CP). The key point for the fabrication of the catalysts is that a certain thickness of the silica shell was wrapped on the multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWNTs) or Pd/MWNTs through biphase stratification approach, and then the samples were calcined to remove the MWNTs. Thereby, h-mSiO2 and Pd@h-mSiO2 samples were obtained. The prepared materials have excellent pore structure and exhibit high specific surface areas. The reduction of 4-NP by the Pd/h-mSiO2 and Pd@h-mSiO2 catalysts showed higher TOF values than many other catalysts, and the yield of HDC of 4-CP to phenol reached 100% with a low loading of Pd in water solvent. The excellent catalytic activities of the Pd/h-mSiO2 and Pd@h-mSiO2 catalysts should attribute to the excellent connectivity of the h-mSiO2 which not only can increase the accessibility of the Pd active sites but also enhance the mass transfer of the reactants. It is worth mention that, there is almost no Pd NPs aggregation or losing during the reaction process, and the prepared catalysts still showed good catalytic activity and physical stability after recycling. Moreover, the catalyst shows potential for catalytic reduction of nitroarenes in a fixed bed reactor, thus could be used for continuously treat nitroarenes polluted water.  aPublisher supplied data 3a4-chlorophenol 3aactive sites 3acarbon nanotubes 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3adechlorination 3amass transfer 3ananoparticles 3aorganic wastes 3ap-nitrophenol 3apalladium 3aphenol 3aporous media 3asilica 3asolvents 3awater pollution 0aPalladium nanoparticles 0aHollow mesoporous silica nanotubes 0aHydrodechlorination 0a4-Nitrophenol 0a4-Chlorophenol1 aLong, Yu1 aXu, Dan1 aWei, Shuoyun1 aDong, Zhengping0 tJournal of colloid and interface science.g2018 July 01, v. 521 p.132-140dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12461x0021-97977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcis.2018.03.0413Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01750naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245010900158300001600267520087500283592002801158650001101186650002101197650002401218650002401242650002501266651001801291773010101309856004101410852000901451655001201460IND50073644920221119091229.0140305e201403  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007364492DNAL7 a10.1111/agec.120412doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShaik, Saleem10aRe‐examination of production, cost, and restricted profit functions using quantile regression approach  ap. 199-212.  aThis article estimates quantile regressions of production, cost, and restricted profit functions using a Cobb‐Douglas functional form with non‐Hicks neutral technology change. In contrast to previous studies, quantile regression estimates reveal the relationship between the independent (production, cost, and restricted profit) and dependent (input quantities and prices) variables at each quantile of the distribution. An empirical application using data from 48 states in United States from 1960 to 2004 indicates the returns to scale and aggregate technology not only differ across production, cost, and restricted profit functions but across states in different quantiles of the distribution. This suggests the traditional measures of returns to scale and aggregate technology are under‐ and overestimated in states at upper and lower quantiles, respectively.  aPublisher supplied data 3aprices 3aproduction costs 3aprofits and margins 3aregression analysis 3atechnological change 3aUnited States0 tAgricultural economics.g2014 Mar., v. 45, no. 2 p.199-212dElsevier Science BVx0169-51507nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/agec.12041  aDNAL 7aarticle03214naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002400144245012600168300002000294520182700314592002802141650001602169650001802185650001302203650001502216650002502231650001102256650001602267650001702283650001302300650001402313650001502327650001102342650002602353650001902379650001302398653002202411653001302433653001902446653002402465653002202489700001802511773012602529856008002655852000902735655001202744IND60548687320221119181121.0160905e20160831xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054868732DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.6b017552doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 avan Helvert, Sjoerd10aStrain Stiffening of Fibrillar Collagen during Individual and Collective Cell Migration Identified by AFM Nanoindentation  ap. 21946-21955.  aThe multistep process of cell migration requires cells to dynamically couple to extracellular interfaces and generate traction force or friction for displacement of the cell body. When deformed, biopolymer networks, including fibrillar collagen and fibrin, undergo a nonlinear elasticity change that is termed strain stiffening and is commonly measured by bulk rheology. It remains poorly characterized, however, whether forces generated by moving cells suffice to induce strain stiffening. To detect strain stiffening at the leading edge of normal and tumor cells moving across fibrillar type I collagen, we combined AFM nanoindentation and differential field probing with confocal reflection microscopy. In different cell models, gradient-like fiber realignment, densification, and elevation of Young’s modulus ahead of the leading edge were observed, with peak increases of up to 1.15 kPa near the leading edge. Moving fibroblasts generated a larger anterograde strain field with a higher amplitude and up to 6-fold increased cumulative strain stiffening (52 kPa) compared with mesenchymal HT1080 fibrosarcoma cells (8.8 kPa) and epithelial SCC38 cancer cells (9.8 kPa). Collectively moving SCC38 cells produced 4-fold increased cumulative strain stiffening (38 kPa) compared with individually moving SCC38 cells in a β1 integrin- and actomyosin-dependent manner. This indicates that the extent of strain stiffening by the leading edge of moving cells scales with cell type, multicellular cooperativity, integrin availability, and contractility. By straining, migrating cells realign and densify fibrillar extracellular matrix and thus adopt an autonomous strategy to move on a “traveling wave” of stiffened substrate, which reaches levels sufficient for mechanosensory activation and self-steering of migration.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiopolymers 3acell movement 3acollagen 3aepithelium 3aextracellular matrix 3afibrin 3afibroblasts 3afibrosarcoma 3afriction 3aintegrins 3amicroscopy 3amodels 3amodulus of elasticity 3aneoplasm cells 3arheology 0astrain stiffening 0acollagen 0acell migration 0aAFM nanoindentation 0aYoung’s modulus1 aFriedl, Peter0 tACS Applied Materials & Interfaces.g2016 Aug. 31, v. 8, no. 34 p.21946-21955dAmerican Chemical Societyx1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facsami.6b017553Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03786naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001300148245019400161300001600355520201200371592002802383650001102411650001102422650001202433650002402445650002802469650002802497650001402525650003802539650001902577650001802596650001102614650001502625650002102640650002002661650001702681650002502698650002202723653000802745653000802753653000702761653000902768653000802777653000702785653001302792653004502805653003402850653001702884653001802901700001902919700001602938700001902954700001802973700001602991773007403007856008203081852000903163655001203172IND60552350720221119174621.0161021e20140715xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055235072DNAL7 a10.1016/j.gene.2013.09.0992doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Dan10aAssociation between the −786T>C 1polymorphism in the promoter region of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) and risk of coronary artery disease: A systematic review and meta-analysis  ap. 175-183.  aA variety of studies have evaluated the association between the −786T>C polymorphism in the promoter region of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) and risk of coronary artery disease (CAD). However, the results remain conflicting. To better understand the role of eNOS −786T>C polymorphism in CAD risk, we conducted a comprehensive systematic review and meta-analysis.Case–control, cohort or cross-sectional studies evaluating the association between eNOS −786T>C polymorphism and CAD risk were searched in electronic databases of PubMed, ISI Web of Knowledge, Medline, Embase and Google Scholar Search (up to January 2013). Overall and subgroup analyses were performed. Odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) were used to evaluate the association between eNOS −786T>C polymorphism and CAD risk. Statistical analysis was performed with Review Manager 5.0 and STATA12.0.Twenty-four studies were analyzed between 6192 CAD cases and 9281 healthy controls. The combined results of overall analysis showed significant positive associations between CAD risk and eNOS −786T>C polymorphism in dominant model (OR=1.45, 95% CI=1.27–1.65), recessive model (OR=1.37, 95% CI=1.20–1.56), homozygote comparison (OR=1.64, 95% CI=1.31–2.04), heterozygote comparison (TC vs. TT, OR=1.39, 95% CI=1.23–1.57; CC vs. TC, OR=1.20, 95% CI=1.04–1.37) and allele comparison (OR=1.35, 95% CI=1.21–1.50). On subgroup analysis based on the ethnicity of population (Caucasians, Asians and others), significant differences were found in all genetic models for Caucasians, similar associations existed in Asians except heterozygote comparison (CC vs. TC). However, the associations were only found in dominant model, heterozygote comparison (TC vs. TT) and allele comparison for the populations named others.Our investigations demonstrate the significant associations between eNOS −786C>T polymorphism and CAD risk, and this polymorphism might become an early marker for the risk evaluation of CAD.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAsians 3aWhites 3aalleles 3aconfidence interval 3acoronary artery disease 3across-sectional studies 3adatabases 3aendothelial nitric oxide synthase 3aheterozygosity 3ameta-analysis 3amodels 3aodds ratio 3apromoter regions 3arisk assessment 3arisk factors 3astatistical analysis 3asystematic review 0aBMI 0aCAD 0aCI 0aeNOS 0aHWE 0aOR 0aPCR-RFLP 0aEndothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) 0aCoronary artery disease (CAD) 0aPolymorphism 0aMeta-analysis1 aJiang, Zhouqin1 aDai, Limeng1 aZhang, Xiaolin1 aYan, Chenghui1 aHan, Yaling0 tGene.g2014 July 15, v. 545 p.175-183dElsevier B.V.x0378-11197nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gene.2013.09.0993Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03272naa a2200733 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003600113040001800149100001600167245013900183300001600322500001500338520093100353592002801284650002101312650001601333650001301349650001101362650001401373650002501387650001001412650001001422650003401432650003801466650001401504650002801518650001801546650001401564650001201578650002301590650006001613650003001673650004001703650001001743650002801753650006801781650004001849650001001889650004101899650004401940651001201984651001501996651001002011651001102021651003902032651002402071653002302095653002002118653002802138653002002166700001402186700002602200700001502226700002502241700001802266700001902284773013102303856008302434852000902517655001202526IND60114101320221122033209.0190318e201310  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011410132DNAL7 a236640152pmid7 a10.1016/j.rvsc.2013.04.0152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJäckel, S.12aA novel indirect ELISA based on glycoprotein Gn for the detection of IgG antibodies against Rift Valley fever virus in small ruminants  ap. 725-730.  a2019-12-04  aRift Valley fever virus (RVFV) is an emerging zoonotic pathogen that causes high morbidity and mortality in humans and livestock.

The performance of this Gn based ELISA is validated using a panel of almost 2000 field samples from sheep and goats from Mozambique, Senegal, Uganda and Yemen. All serum samples were also tested by virus neutralization test (VNT), the gold standard method for RVFV serological testing. Compared to the VNT results the Gn based ELISA proved to have an excellent sensitivity (94.56%) and specificity (95.57%). Apart from establishing this new diagnostic assay, these results also demonstrate a close correlation between the presence of RVFV Gn and neutralizing antibodies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aimmunoglobulin G 3ablood serum 3aantigens 3ahumans 3amorbidity 3aneutralization tests 3asheep 3agoats 3aRift Valley fever phlebovirus 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3amortality 3aneutralizing antibodies 3aglycoproteins 3apathogens 2aAnimals 2aCloning, Molecular 2aEnzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assayxmethodsxveterinary. 2aGlycoproteinsxmetabolism 2aGoat Diseasesxdiagnosisxvirology. 2aGoats 2aImmunoglobulin Gxblood 2aRift Valley Feverxdiagnosisximmunologyxveterinaryxvirology. 2aRift Valley fever virusximmunology 2aSheep 2aSheep Diseasesxdiagnosisxvirology. 2aViral Proteinsximmunologyxmetabolism. 3aSenegal 3aMozambique 3aYemen 3aUganda 0aAfrica, Sub-Saharanxepidemiology. 0aYemenxepidemiology 0aIndirect IgG ELISA 0aGlycoprotein Gn 0aRift Valley fever virus 0aSmall ruminants1 aEiden, M.1 aBalkema-Buschmann, A.1 aZiller, M.1 aJansen van Vuren, P.1 aPaweska, J.T.1 aGroschup, M.H.0 tResearch in veterinary science.g2013 Oct., v. 95, no. 2 p.725-730dElsevier India Pvt Ltd.wJournal:jnl45491x0034-52887nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rvsc.2013.04.0153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02950naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100006600151245019000217520149100407592002801898650001401926650001501940650002501955650001201980650001301992650002702005650002602032650001302058650000902071650001402080650001702094650001002111650001502121650001002136653002102146653003102167653002502198653002702223700005802250773011302308856008602421852000902507655001202516IND60687938020221119025634.0210212e20200710xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068793802DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.1212072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDevarangadi, Manikanta1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1144-093910aCorrelation studies on geotechnical properties of various industrial byproducts generated from thermal power plants, iron and steel industries as liners in a landfill- a detailed review  aThe utilization of industrial byproducts in landfill liners has shown increasing interest and continuous awareness in meeting their regulatory standards (i.e. 1 × 10⁻⁷ cm/s, as per the United States Environmental Protection Agency) and often proved to be suitable as a liner material. This paper reviews the use and application of two largely produced industrial byproducts namely, thermal power stations (i.e. fly ash and bottom ash) and iron-steel industries (i.e. steel slag and blast furnace slag) as a liner in a landfill. A detailed and critical review of these byproducts with their experimental data on geotechnical properties such as index properties, compaction characteristics, compressive strength and hydraulic conductivity were presented. The aim of this paper is to provide geotechnical correlations on hydraulic conductivity with index properties, compaction characteristics and compressive strength of various industrial byproducts with soil types and additives were discussed. The presented correlations between hydraulic conductivity and other engineering properties will be helpful in determining the design parameters for landfill liner. From the set of resulted correlations, optimum percentage binders for each industrial byproduct are highlighted. Overall, these geotechnical correlations prove to be innovative which were obtained from experimental data will serve as a benchmark to validate the experimental results for various upcoming research works.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadditives 3abottom ash 3acompression strength 3afly ash 3afurnaces 3ahydraulic conductivity 3aindustrial byproducts 3aindustry 3airon 3alandfills 3apower plants 3aslags 3asoil types 3asteel 0aIndex properties 0aCompaction characteristics 0aCompressive strength 0aHydraulic conductivity1 aM, Uma Shankar1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1473-37770 tJournal of cleaner production.g2020 July 10, v. 261 p.121207-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.1212073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02664naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245007100170300001600241500001500257520137100272592002801643650000901671650004401680650002101724650001401745650001501759650002501774650001901799650001801818650001101836650002701847653001201874653001601886653001801902653000901920653001401929653002701943653002701970700001801997773010802015856008602123852000902209655001202218IND50060440020221122220835.0190318e20130204xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006044002DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhydrol.2012.11.0492doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGrover, S.P.P.14aThe link between peat hydrology and decomposition: Beyond von Post  ap. 130-138.  a2019-12-06  aHydrology is central to the formation, growth and utilisation of peat soils. However, peat presents a difficult medium in which to measure hydrologic properties, due to its soft structure and high water content. The von Post scale is a widely used measure of the extent of decomposition of peat, which can be applied in the field or the laboratory without specialised equipment. von Post decomposition has been shown to correlate with hydraulic conductivity. However, it is a categorical and subjective measure of decomposition. Technological advances now enable peat chemistry to be described quantitatively and objectively. 13C nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) is now routinely used to describe peat chemistry, and the capability of this technique has been extended by the development of the molecular mixing model (MMM). The MMM predicts the molecular composition of organic material from the spectral information provided by 13C NMR. We found significant relationships between the hydrologic properties hydraulic conductivity and water yield and peat chemistry as described by 13C NMR and the MMM. These relationships have potential application in all fields where the hydrologic properties of peat soils are of interest (i.e. peat mining, peatland restoration, catchment management) and also in modelling of peatland development and responses to climate change.  aPublisher supplied data 3apeat 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3amolecular models 3aequipment 3apeat soils 3awatershed management 3aclimate change 3awater content 3amining 3ahydraulic conductivity 0a13C NMR 0aWater yield 0aDecomposition 0aPeat 0ahydrology 0aHydraulic conductivity 0aMolecular mixing model1 aBaldock, J.A.0 tJournal of hydrology.g2013 Feb. 04, v. 479 p.130-138dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl46539x0022-16947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2012.11.0493Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03226naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002300151245012600174300001800300500001900318520165700337536008601994592002802080596001702108650002302125650002302148650002102171650002102192650001402213650002102227650001102248650001902259650001602278650001702294650001802311650001902329650001702348651000902365653001502374653001102389653003302400653001802433700001702451700002102468773014802489856008602637852000902723655001202732IND60716593920221120223445.0201116e20201010xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071659392DNAL7 a10.1080/00103624.2020.18362032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPeyghan, Khashayar10aSimulation of quinoa (Chenopodium quinoa) yield and soil salinity under salinity and water stress using the SALTMED model  ap. 2361-2376.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aDue to increasing soil and water salinity in arid and semiarid regions around the world, people in these areas suffer from the lack of fresh quality water for drinking, irrigation, production of crops and livestock. This research was thus carried out in Khuzestan province, in the southwest of Iran, with a hot and dry climate, to simulate quinoa (Chenopodium quinoa) yield and soil salinity under salinity and water stress using the SALTMED model. To that end, the field data from a split-plot experiment with a randomized complete block design including treatments with four levels of water salinity (Karun river water, ECW 10, 20 and 30 dS/m) and three levels of irrigation (full irrigation (278 mm), regulated deficit irrigation at 75% (208 mm) and 50% (139 mm)), were used. The results showed that saline water and deficit irrigation negatively affected most investigated parameters of yield and yield components of quinoa; however, quinoa was able to grow even with ECw 20 (dS/m) under deficit irrigation at 50%. According to the results of sensitivity analysis, the irrigation water amount had the most effect on the output parameters of the SALTMED model. Once successfully calibrated and validated, the model proved to be efficient for estimating the quinoa crop yield and soil salinity under different irrigation strategies and water qualities. Besides, the coefficients of determination (R²) obtained for simulating yield response of quinoa crop and soil salinity were 0.922 and 0.992, respectively. The results also showed no significant difference in model performance in simulating quinoa crop yield compared to soil salinity simulation.  aThis work was supported by the Shahid Chamran University of Ahvaz [SCU.WI98.281].  aPublisher supplied data  aSCU.WI98.281 3aChenopodium quinoa 3adeficit irrigation 3airrigation rates 3airrigation water 3alivestock 3amodel validation 3amodels 3aplant analysis 3ariver water 3asaline water 3asoil salinity 3awater salinity 3awater stress 3aIran 0aCrop yield 0aquinoa 0aregulated deficit irrigation 0aSALTMED model1 aGolabi, Mona1 aAlbaji, Mohammad0 tCommunications in soil science and plant analysis.g2020 Oct. 10, v. 51, no. 18 p.2361-2376dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl1842x1532-24167nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00103624.2020.18362033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02570naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002000148245013400168520123300302592002801535650001901563650004101582650001201623650001401635650001201649650001101661650000901672650001801681650001301699650001501712650001101727650001101738650001201749651001401761653001801775653002401793653001701817653001401834653002001848653001301868700002501881773011401906856008302020852000902103655001202112IND60697166120221122200049.0200719e202005  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069716612DNAL7 a10.1016/j.rsma.2020.1013292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSimeonova, Anna10aMacroplastic distribution (Single-use plastics and some Fishing gear) from the northern to the southern Bulgarian Black Sea coast  aMarine litter (ML) survey was conducted on 10 beaches along the Bulgarian Black Sea coast in summer period 2017.

The role of light in photosynthesis and photomorphogenesis has been appreciated for some time; however, the role of light in plant defence is a comparatively recent realization. Between 75–100 photosensitizers or phototoxins, molecules that become toxic in the presence of light, have been extracted from higher plant tissues. These biologically‐active compounds have diverse biosynthetic origins and belong to at least 15 different phytochemical classes (i.e. acetophenones, acetylenes, benzophenanthrenes, β‐carbolines, coumarins, extended quinones, furanochromones, furanocoumarins, furanoquinolines, isoquinolines, lignans, pterocarpans, quinolines, sesquiterpenes and thiophenes). Of more than 100 angiosperm families assayed, phototoxins and/or phototoxic activity have been reported in c. 40 families representing 32 orders and 8 subclasses of the Magnoliophyta. Most of these allelochemicals are acute toxins with little organism‐specificity. As such, they are effective biocides capable of killing a wide‐range of potentially harmful organisms including: viruses, pathogenic bacteria and fungi, nematodes and herbivorous insects, as well as competing plant species. This review focuses on the phytochemistry, taxonomic occurrence and toxicological consequences of phototoxic metabolites in flowering plants. The available information suggests that phototoxic phytochemicals: (i) are broad‐spectrum allelochemicals capable of protecting plants against a variety of detrimental organisms in nature, (ii) represent a successful defensive strategy in both primitive and advanced plant taxa, and (iii) may be an effective defence under a variety of photoenvironmental conditions.

The cessation of cultivation allows the potential recovery of soil aggregate binding agents such as soil micro‐organisms and biochemical properties. Consequently, an increase in soil aggregate stability is expected. However, this outcome is difficult to predict because the response of each individual soil component and its contribution to soil stability varies. This study utilized a chronosequence of 12 ex‐arable fields in the Bolivian Altiplano, representing six soil ages of abandonment after cessation of potato cultivation, to examine whether soil aggregate stability increases after abandonment and the extent to which changes in soil bacterial and fungal community composition and soil chemical properties are involved in stability recovery. Fields with the longest time since disturbance (15 and 20 years) have a greater proportion of water‐stable aggregates than more recently abandoned fields (1 and 3 years) and exhibit larger differences in bacterial and fungal composition. Total N, NH4+, C and organic matter also increased with time since the last intensive agricultural practice. Water‐stable aggregates were strongly correlated with soil fungal community composition. Analysis of covariance is also consistent with the soil fungal community being an important mediator of the recovery of aggregate stability. Synthesis and applications. Soil aggregate stability increased by 50% over the 20 years following disturbance. This recovery was associated with shifts in soil fungal community composition, as is consistent with fungal mediation of this recovery. Land management strategies focusing on restoration of the soil fungal community may enhance soil aggregate stability, a key aspect for soil conservation, restoration, sustainability of agroecosystems and erosion prevention.  aPublisher supplied data  aCRN2014cInter‐American Institute for Global Change Research  aGEO‐04523250cNSF  aDEB‐0919434cNSF 3aaggregate stability 3aagricultural land 3aagroecosystems 3aanalysis of covariance 3aapplied ecology 3achronosequences 3acommunity structure 3aerosion control 3afungal communities 3aland management 3aorganic matter 3apotatoes 3asoil bacteria 3asoil fungi 3atotal nitrogen1 aSullivan, Tarah S.1 aBontti, Eliana1 aBever, James D.0 tJournal of applied ecology.g2013 Oct., v. 50, no. 5 p.1266-1273dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl57298x0021-89017nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1365-2664.121303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03090naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094024002200127024001900149040001800168100002200186245007700208300001300285506007600298520171100374592002802085506003702113650002002150650002302170650001102193650001402204650002002218650003102238650001002269650001102279650002002290650001702310650002002327650001502347650001102362700002202373700002202395700002102417773010602438856007902544852000902623655001202632IND60119536320221207075251.0141214e200509  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011953632DNAL7 a10.1186/gb-2005-6-9-r742doi7 aPMC12422092pmcid7 a161680812pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDiehn, Jennifer J10aDifferential gene expression in anatomical compartments of the human eye  ap. 1109.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: The human eye is composed of multiple compartments, diverse in form, function, and embryologic origin, that work in concert to provide us with our sense of sight. We set out to systematically characterize the global gene expression patterns that specify the distinctive characteristics of the various eye compartments. RESULTS: We used DNA microarrays representing approximately 30,000 human genes to analyze gene expression in the cornea, lens, iris, ciliary body, retina, and optic nerve. The distinctive patterns of expression in each compartment could be interpreted in relation to the physiology and cellular composition of each tissue. Notably, the sets of genes selectively expressed in the retina and in the lens were particularly large and diverse. Genes with roles in immune defense, particularly complement components, were expressed at especially high levels in the anterior segment tissues. We also found consistent differences between the gene expression patterns of the macula and peripheral retina, paralleling the differences in cell layer densities between these regions. Based on the hypothesis that genes responsible for diseases that affect a particular eye compartment are likely to be selectively expressed in that compartment, we compared our gene expression signatures with genetic mapping studies to identify candidate genes for diseases affecting the cornea, lens, and retina. CONCLUSION: Through genome-scale gene expression profiling, we were able to discover distinct gene expression 'signatures' for each eye compartment and identified candidate disease genes that can serve as a reference database for investigating the physiology and pathophysiology of the eye.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDNA microarrays 3achromosome mapping 3acornea 3adatabases 3agene expression 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3ahumans 3aimmune response 3anerve tissue 3apathophysiology 3aphysiology 3aretina1 aDiehn, Maximilian1 aMarmor, Michael F1 aBrown, Patrick O0 tGenome biology.g2005 Sept., v. 6, no. 9 p.1109-1109dSpringer-VerlagwJournal:19127x1474-760X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1186/gb-2005-6-9-r743Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02898naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100006400147245011500211506010400326506007600430520130400506592002801810506003701838650001601875650001001891650002801901650001001929650001201939650002301951653002901974653002402003653002202027653002302049653002102072653000702093653000802100700002102108700002202129700006502151700002002216773012502236856008202361852000902443655001202452IND60758832120221207082719.0220914e20220201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075883212DNAL7 a10.1016/j.lwt.2021.1128502doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDittrich, Anna Joana1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1463-568610aEffect of high hydrostatic pressure on Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica in Nutrient Broth and dried parsley  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe effect of high hydrostatic pressure on Salmonella isolates in Nutrient Broth (10³, 10⁸ CFU mL⁻¹) and dried parsley (10³, 10⁷ CFU g⁻¹) was determined at 250–550 MPa for 2.5–10.0 min at 25 °C. Reduction efficiency as well as quality parameters (total chlorophyll, phenolic compounds, spectrophotometric colour) of parsley were investigated. At selected parameters (2.5, 5.0 min; 550 MPa) sensory analysis was performed and the impact of prolonging Salmonella inoculation time before treatment (48 h) and post-treatment storage (70 days) was examined. Reductions of 0.9–8.8 log CFU were achieved in Nutrient Broth, with higher pressures or longer dwell times required to completely reduce viable cells at 10⁸ CFU mL⁻¹. In parsley, reductions were significantly lower (p < 0.05), ranging between 1.2 and 2.5 log CFU at 10³ CFU g⁻¹. The reduction efficiency was further decreased by increasing the contamination level (10⁷ CFU g⁻¹: 0.7–1.5 log CFU) or extension of the inoculation time (10³ CFU g⁻¹: 1.1–1.3 log CFU). Total chlorophyll was not significantly influenced, while phenolic compounds slightly increased (3.5–8.3%). Sensory analysis proved significant but no adverse differences in colour and odour of pressure-treated parsley.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3achlorophyll 3acolor 3ahigh pressure treatment 3aodors 3aparsley 3asensory evaluation 0aHigh pressure processing 0aMicrobial reduction 0aTotal chlorophyll 0aPhenolic compounds 0aSensory analysis 0aCL 0aLOD1 aLudewig, Martina1 aRodewald, Steffen1 aBraun, Peggy Gabriele1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1619-48421 aWiacek, Claudia0 tLebensmittel-Wissenschaft + Technologie.g2022 Feb. 01, v. 155 p.112850-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl1644x0023-64387nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lwt.2021.1128503Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02690naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002100151245009700172500001900269520119800288536003701486592002801523596004801551650002601599650001701625650002401642650001501666650001001681650001201691650002101703650001101724650003301735650002501768650001601793650002601809650002601835650001501861653000801876653001401884653002401898700002601922700001901948700001901967700001701986773009802003856008602101852000902187655001202196IND60691275020221122004025.0210313e20161231xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069127502DNAL7 a10.1080/23312025.2016.11753322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAwasthi, Praveen10aHomology modeling and docking study of chalcone synthase gene (CfCHS) from Coleus forskohlii  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aFlavonoids are important secondary metabolites in plants. Chalcone synthase (CHS) catalyzes the first committed step in the flavonoids biosynthesis. CHS belongs to type ΙΙΙ polyketide synthases that are known for their broad substrate specificity and catalytic potential toward a wide range of thioesters, to produce diverse novel polyketides of pharmaceutical importance. In this study, an in silico approach was used to understand the structure and function of CHS protein from an important medicinal plant Coleus forskohlii. A homology model of CfCHS was built and docking studies were carried out using 25 ligands. Best four docked ligands in proposed binding pocket of CfCHS were: Cinnamoyl CoA, 2-Carbamoylbenzoyl CoA, Benzoyl CoA and p-Coumaroyl CoA. Cys 164, His 304, and Asn 337 were found to be catalytic residues of CfCHS. Further two important residues, Phe 216 and Phe 266, were found to be the gatekeeper residues involved in π–π interaction with ligands. Present study revealed broad spectrum substrate profile of CfCHS and important key residues involved in substrate binding. This is the first report of homology modeling and docking analysis of CHS from C. forskohlii.  aThis work was supported by CSIR.  aPublisher supplied data  cCSIRdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100001332 3aPlectranthus barbatus 3abiosynthesis 3acomputer simulation 3aflavonoids 3agenes 3aligands 3amedicinal plants 3amodels 3anaringenin-chalcone synthase 3apolyketide synthases 3apolyketides 3asecondary metabolites 3asubstrate specificity 3athioesters 0aCHS 0aflavonoid 0apolyketide synthase1 aJamwal, Vijay Lakshmi1 aKapoor, Nitika1 aRasool, Shafaq1 aBahler, Jurg0 tCogent biology.g2016 Dec. 31, v. 2, no. 1 p.1175332-dCogentwJournal:27203x2331-20257nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/23312025.2016.11753323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03139naa a2200673 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003800113040001800151100001800169245011300187300001800300520127100318592002801589650001601617650001301633650000901646650001301655650000901668650002001677650001001697650001301707650001301720650001101733650001401744650001401758650001201772650001001784650001201794650001201806650003001818650003001848650002001878650001801898650001301916650002801929650001401957650002201971650002401993650004802017650002702065651001002092651001002102700001602112700001202128700001302140700001802153700001602171700001402187700001702201700001602218700001702234773010902251856008402360852000902444655001202453IND60099497020221123033904.0141105e201210  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009949702DNAL7 a227505522pmid7 a10.1016/j.meegid.2012.06.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGuo, Dongchun10aFull genomic analysis of rabbit rotavirus G3P[14] strain N5 in China: Identification of a novel VP6 genotype  ap. 1567-1576.  aGroup A rotaviruses (RVAs) are major pathogens associated with acute gastroenteritis in young children and in a wide variety of domestic animals. The full-length genome of a rabbit RVA strain, RVA/Rabbit-tc/CHN/N5/1992/G3P[14], showed a G3-P[14]-I17-R3-C3-M3-A9-N1-T1-E3-H2 genomic configuration. A novel VP6 genotype, I17, was confirmed by the Rotavirus Classification Working Group. Phylogenetic analyses revealed that strain N5 possessed VP1–3, VP7, NSP1–2 and NSP4 genes closely related to those of the simian strain TUCH, NSP3 and NSP5 genes closely related to the human strains Wa and 69M, and a VP4 gene closely related to the rabbit strain 30/96 and sheep strain OVR762. The RRV and TUCH shared their ancestry with canine/feline RVAs and showed a close relationship to the human T152/feline-like RVAs. Comparison with the genotypes of the simian strains TUCH and RRV, canine strains A79-10, CU-1, K9, feline strains Cat2 and Cat97, and human strains T152 and 69M showed that RVA/Rabbit-tc/CHN/N5/1992/G3P[14] was possibly of feline/canine origin, or was a multiple reassortment involving canine, feline and human rotaviruses. The sequencing and phylogenetic analyses of rotavirus genomes is critical to the elucidation of the patterns of virus evolution.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRotavirus A 3aancestry 3acats 3achildren 3adogs 3agastroenteritis 3agenes 3agenomics 3agenotype 3ahumans 3apathogens 3aphylogeny 3arabbits 3asheep 3aviruses 2aAnimals 2aAntigens, Viralxgenetics 2aCapsid Proteinsxgenetics 2aFecesxvirology 2aGenome, Viral 2aGenotype 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPhylogeny 2aRabbitsxvirology 2aRotavirusxgenetics 2aRotavirus Infectionsxveterinaryxvirology. 2aSequence Analysis, RNA 3aChina 0aChina1 aLiu, Jiasen1 aLu, Yan1 aSun, Yan1 aYuan, Dongwei1 aJiang, Qian1 aLin, Huan1 aLi, Changwen1 aSi, Changde1 aQu, Liandong0 tInfection, genetics, and evolution.g2012 Oct., v. 12, no. 7 p.1567-1576dElsevier B.V.x1567-13487nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.meegid.2012.06.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03029naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001900149245012200168520131800290592002801608650002601636650001401662650002001676650001601696650000901712650002001721650003101741650001001772650002401782650002101806650002301827650002601850650001001876650004301886650001401929650002101943650001801964650002101982650003302003653001402036653001002050653001702060653002102077653001702098700001602115700001702131700001902148700001402167700001802181700001802199700001602217700001302233773010002246856008402346852000902430655001202439IND60697166220221122200059.0201024e202007  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069716622DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aqrep.2020.1003822doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Xiaojin10aEffects of waterborne exposure to 17β-estradiol on hepatic lipid metabolism genes in tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus)  aEstradiol is a steroid hormone that regulates multiple physiological processes in teleosts. The present study aimed to investigate the role of 17β-estradiol (E2) in lipid metabolism in the liver of Nile tilapia. Waterborne exposures were performed using different concentrations of E2 (0 ng/L, 10 ng/L, 25 ng/L and 50 ng/L) and its receptor inhibitor ICI 182,780 (ICI) (1 μM/L). Subsequently, the survival rate and hepatosomatic index (HSI) of tilapia were measured and no significant changes could be found following E2 exposure. Gene expression of VLDL assembly, lipoprotein lipase and lipoprotein receptor, fatty acid uptake and triacylglycerol metabolism were detected by qPCR. E2 exposure up-regulated the expression of lipid metabolism-related genes MTP, LPL, CD36 and DGAT2. ICI exposure inhibited the level of LDLR in the liver of tilapia. This showed that E2 stimulated the MTP expression and promoted VLDL synthesis. In addition, E2 waterborne exposure induced secretion of LDLR and LPL and promoted fatty acid production. Moreover, E2 up-regulated the expression of CD36 to accelerate the transport of fatty acids. Overall, our study provides new information for evaluating Environmental estrogens (EEs) effects on farming fishes and endocrinological regulation on lipid metabolism in fish.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOreochromis niloticus 3aestradiol 3afarming systems 3afatty acids 3afish 3agene expression 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3ahepatosomatic index 3alipid metabolism 3alipoprotein lipase 3alipoprotein receptors 3aliver 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3asecretion 3asteroid hormones 3asurvival rate 3atriacylglycerols 3avery low density lipoprotein 0aEstradiol 0aLiver 0aNile tilapia 0aLipid metabolism 0aTriglyceride1 aZhong, Huan1 aHan, Zhuojun1 aTang, Zhanyang1 aXiao, Jun1 aGuo, Zhongbao1 aWang, Fenghua1 aLuo, Yongju1 aZhou, Yi0 tAquaculture reports.g2020 July, v. 17 p.100382-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23215x2352-51347nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aqrep.2020.1003823Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03341naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001900148245012200167300001600289520174300305592002802048650001502076650001502091650001302106650002102119650001502140650001602155650002002171650003102191650002002222650000902242650001102251650002002262650001702282650001402299650001302313650001402326650002102340650001602361653003302377653007002410653001802480653000802498653001402506700001902520700001202539700001802551700001402569700001702583773009602600856008202696852000902778655001202787IND60553481620221119042344.0161021e20151015xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055348162DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bios.2015.05.0242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Jianguo10aLuminescence energy transfer detection of PSA in red region based on Mn2+-enhanced NaYF4:Yb, Er upconversion nanorods  ap. 282-287.  aA new turn-on luminescence energy transfer (LET) system has been designed for the detection of prostate specific antigen (PSA, a cancer marker) that utilizes Mn2+-enhanced long wavelength luminescence NaYF4:Yb, Er upconversion nanorods as the donor and gold nanorods as the acceptor. The Mn2+-doped NaYF4:Yb,Er upconversion luminescence nanorods with an emission peak located in the red region were synthesized. The presence of Mn2+ markedly increased the luminescence intensity over that of the NaYF4:Yb, Er upconversion nanomaterials (excited by a 980nm continuous wavelength laser). The surfaces of Mn2+-doped NaYF4:Yb, Er upconversion nanorods were modified with poly(acrylic acid). Antibodies against prostate specific antigen were bound to the surface of the carboxyl-functionalized upconversion nanorods, which acted as the energy donor in this LET system. Gold nanorods with an absorption band at ~666nm were synthesized by the seed growth method, acted as the energy acceptor. The emission band of the upconversion nanorods overlapped well with the absorption band of the gold nanorods. The luminescence was quenched because of the electrostatic interactions that shortened the distance between the donor (negatively charged) and the accepter (positively charged).When the PSA antigen was added into the system, the energy acceptor and the energy donors were separated because the binding affinity between PSA and anti-PSA was greater than the electrostatic interactions, and thereby the luminescence was recovered. The linear range of detecting PSA was from 0.1172 to 18.75ng/mL (R=0.995), with a limit of detection for PSA as low as 0.1129ng/mL. The method was successfully applied to the sensing of PSA in human serum samples.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3aantibodies 3aantigens 3abinding capacity 3abiosensors 3ablood serum 3adetection limit 3aelectrostatic interactions 3aenergy transfer 3agold 3ahumans 3alight intensity 3aluminescence 3amanganese 3ananorods 3aneoplasms 3apolyacrylic acid 3awavelengths 0aLuminescence energy transfer 0aMn2+-enhanced NaYF4:Yb, Er upconversion red luminescence nanorods 0aGold nanorods 0aPSA 0aDetection1 aWang, Shaozhen1 aGao, Ni1 aFeng, Dexiang1 aWang, Lun1 aChen, Hongqi0 tBiosensors & bioelectronics.g2015 Oct. 15, v. 72 p.282-287dElsevier B.V.x0956-56637nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bios.2015.05.0243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02275naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002100151245012500172500001900297520094300316536007101259592002801330650002301358650000901381650002701390650001101417650000901428650002001437651001201457653002601469653001201495653001601507653001801523653002601541700002501567700002901592700001701621700002201638773009801660856008601758852000901844655001201853IND60691275120221122003859.0210313e20161231xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069127512DNAL7 a10.1080/23312025.2016.11826112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBoukeloua, Ahmed10aChemical profiling and total thickness-excised wound-healing activity of Pistacia lentiscus L. fruits growing in Algeria  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe aim of this study was to determine the chemical characterization and to assess full-thickness-excised wound-healing activity of the oil of Pistacia lentiscus L. fruits grown in Algeria. The fatty acid composition of P. lentiscus L. extracts were analyzed by GC–MS and their total protein amounts were determined by elemental analysis. Total thickness-excised wound-healing activity of hexane extract was carried out on rabbits; comparing oil and wax effects. The results showed that P. lentiscus L. fruits contain considerable levels of oil and protein. Additionally, oleic (46.91 ± 1.03, 48.34 ± 0.07) in hexane and cold pressure extracts, respectively, palmitic (25.75 ± 0.82, 25.44 ± 0.65) and linoleic (20.59 ± 0.03, 20.27 ± 0.81) acids were the major fatty acids. Wound-healing activity was significantly higher in P. lentiscus L. fatty oil compared to the wax, therefore, fats refining is wildly recommended.  aFunding.

Toxicity is an expression of being poisonous, indicating the state of adverse effects led by the interaction between toxicants and cells. This interaction may vary depending on the chemical properties of the toxicants and the cell membrane. Hence, evaluation of toxic properties of a substance is crucial when considering for public health protection. Protease inhibitors (PIs) are low molecular mass proteins that are ubiquitous in nature. They are natural antagonists of protease, which are present in all life forms. The present study aims to determine the toxicity of purified PI from the fruits of Solanum aculeatissimum using an acute and subchronic oral toxicity test in animal models. No significant changes in the enzymes level were observed. No adverse changes were noticed in the experimental animal treated with purified PI.  aThis work was supported by Department of Science and Technology, Government of Kerala (INSPIRE fellowship) [grant number IF130468].  aPublisher supplied data  aINSPIRE fellowship (IF130468)cDepartment of Science and Technology, Government of Keraladhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100006143 3aSolanum aculeatissimum 3acell membranes 3ahealth promotion 3alaboratory animals 3amolecular weight 3aproteinase inhibitors 3aproteinases 3atoxic substances 3atoxicity 3atoxicity testing 0aprotease inhibitors 0aWistar rats 0ahistopathology1 aMurugan, K.1 aHsu, Tsai-Ching0 tCogent biology.g2016 Dec. 31, v. 2, no. 1 p.1191588-dCogentwJournal:27203x2331-20257nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/23312025.2016.11915883Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02251naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004400111040001800155100001900173245005200192300001600244500002000260500001500280520039200295592002800687650001100715650001700726650003900743650001200782650002200794650001400816650002400830650001600854650001700870650002200887650001900909650002200928650001200950650002100962650002800983650005001011650000901061650001101070650000901081650001301090650007801103650006301181650004801244700004001292700001801332700001501350700001701365700001501382700001801397773013401415852000901549856009101558655001201649IND4373167020221120111520.0211202e200506  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437316702DNAL7 a159719012pmid7 a10.1111/j.1748-5827.2005.tb00324.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVermeersch, K.10aSensory neuropathy in two Border collie puppies  ap. 295-299.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  a2019-12-04  aA peripheral sensory neuropathy was diagnosed in two Border collie puppies.

The column was subject to sedimentological analyses, and to ‘high‐resolution’ palynological analyses, including pollen preservation and microscopic charcoal counts. Five radiocarbon dates were obtained. The site, at 750 m OD, is thought to have been just below the tree‐line, within hazel‐birch woodland, with some elm, but close to its upper limit. Peat inception at c. 5950 cal BP is thought to have been climatic in origin, in the absence of evidence for anthropogenic activity. Slight anthropogenic modifications to the scrubby woodland, with a decline of elm, are recorded from c. 5250 cal BP, close to the lower axe debitage layer. Clearance at this time appears not to have been for grazing, but was possibly for fires. The modification of the montane grass‐heath to an ‘anthropogenic’ grassland under grazing pressure occurred later, from c. 4600 cal BP, prior to the second period of axe ‘manufacture’ at c 3800 cal BP.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanthropogenic activities 3acarbon radioisotopes 3acharcoal 3agrasslands 3apaleoecology 3apalynology 3apeat 3apollen 3atreeline 3awoodlands 3aScotland1 aEdmonds, Mark,1 aSheridan, Alison,0 tnew phytologist.g1993 Mar., v. 123, no. 3 p.585-597dBlackwell Publishing LtdwJournal:jnl44665x0028-646X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1469-8137.1993.tb03771.x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03361naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100002000188245011500208300001800323506007600341520168600417592002802103506003702131650001702168650002002185650002202205650002002227650001202247650002402259650002402283650001302307650001502320650001802335650001602353650001102369650003302380650001302413650001302426650002302439650001302462650001602475653000902491653000702500653000802507653000802515653000802523700002002531700002302551700002002574773009902594856008102693852000902774655001202783IND60528770420221207095723.0160716e20160424xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052877042DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jmb.2016.02.0322doi7 aPMC58024042pmcid7 a269723392pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStiers, Kyle M.10aInduced Structural Disorder as a Molecular Mechanism for Enzyme Dysfunction in Phosphoglucomutase 1 Deficiency  ap. 1493-1505.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aHuman phosphoglucomutase 1 (PGM1) plays a central role in cellular glucose homeostasis, mediating the switch between glycolysis and gluconeogenesis through the conversion of glucose 1-phosphate and glucose 6-phosphate. Recent clinical studies have identified mutations in this enzyme as the cause of PGM1 deficiency, an inborn error of metabolism classified as both a glycogen storage disease and a congenital disorder of glycosylation. Reported here are the first crystal structures of two disease-related missense variants of PGM1, along with the structure of the wild-type enzyme. Two independent glycine-to-arginine substitutions (G121R and G291R), both affecting key active site loops of PGM1, are found to induce regions of structural disorder, as evidenced by a nearly complete loss of electron density for as many as 23 aa. The disordered regions are not contiguous in sequence to the site of mutation, and even cross domain boundaries. Other structural rearrangements include changes in the conformations of loops and side chains, some of which occur nearly 20Å away from the site of mutation. The induced structural disorder is correlated with increased sensitivity to proteolysis and lower-resolution diffraction, particularly for the G291R variant. Examination of the multi-domain effects of these G➔R mutations establishes a correlation between interdomain interfaces of the enzyme and missense variants of PGM1 associated with disease. These crystal structures provide the first insights into the structural basis of enzyme dysfunction in PGM1 deficiency and highlight a growing role for biophysical characterization of proteins in the field of precision medicine.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aactive sites 3aclinical trials 3acrystal structure 3agluconeogenesis 3aglucose 3aglucose 1-phosphate 3aglucose 6-phosphate 3aglycogen 3aglycolysis 3aglycosylation 3ahomeostasis 3ahumans 3ainherited metabolic diseases 3amedicine 3amutation 3aphosphoglucomutase 3aproteins 3aproteolysis 0aCAPS 0aWT 0aANS 0aTEV 0aPDB1 aKain, Bailee N.1 aGraham, Abigail C.1 aBeamer, Lesa J.0 tJournal of Molecular Biology.g2016 Apr. 24, v. 428 p.1493-1505dElsevier Ltdx0022-28367nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jmb.2016.02.0323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03690naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245015000166300001400316520211200330592002802442650000802470650001802478650001602496650001702512650001002529650001202539650001002551650000902561650001402570650001202584650001302596650002302609650002702632650001202659650001502671651001502686653001602701653001602717653001702733653001402750653000902764653001502773653001802788653001602806700002302822700001702845700002202862700002102884700001802905773011002923856008203033852000903115655001203124IND60607771320221119210514.0180830e201611  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060777132DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jas.2016.10.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGrealy, Alicia10aTropical ancient DNA from bulk archaeological fish bone reveals the subsistence practices of a historic coastal community in southwest Madagascar  ap. 82-88.  aTaxonomic identification of archaeological fish bones provides important insights into the subsistence practices of ancient coastal peoples. However, it can be difficult to execute robust morphological identification of fish bones from species-rich fossil assemblages, especially from post-cranial material with few distinguishing features. Fragmentation, weathering and burning further impede taxonomic identification, resulting in large numbers of unidentifiable bones from archaeological sites. This limitation can be somewhat mitigated by taking an ancient DNA (aDNA) bulk-bone metabarcoding (BBM) approach to faunal identification, where DNA from non-diagnostic bone fragments is extracted and sequenced in parallel. However, a large proportion of fishing communities (both past and present) live in tropical regions that have sub-optimal conditions for long-term aDNA preservation. To date, the BBM method has never been applied to fish bones before, or to fossils excavated from an exposed context within a tropical climate. Here, we demonstrate that morphologically indistinct bulk fish bone from the tropics can be identified by sequencing aDNA extracted from 100 to 300 ya archaeological midden material in southwest Madagascar. Despite the biases of the approach, we rapidly obtained family, genus, and species-level assemblage information, and used this to describe a subset of the ichthyofauna exploited by an 18th century fishing community. We identified 23 families of fish, including benthic, pelagic, and coral-dwelling fishes, suggesting a reliance on a variety of marine and brackish habitats. When possible, BBM should be used alongside osteological approaches to address the limitations of both; however, this study highlights how genetic methods can nevertheless be a valuable tool for helping resolve faunal assemblages when morphological identification is hindered by taphonomic processes, lack of adequate comparative collections, and time constraints, and can provide a temporal perspective on fish biodiversity in the context of accelerated exploitation of the marine environment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aDNA barcoding 3aarchaeology 3abiodiversity 3abones 3aburning 3afauna 3afish 3afisheries 3afossils 3ahabitats 3amarine environment 3aspecies identification 3atropics 3aweathering 3aMadagascar 0aAncient DNA 0aArchaeology 0aBiodiversity 0aBulk-bone 0aFish 0aMadagascar 0aMetabarcoding 0aSubsistence1 aDouglass, Kristina1 aHaile, James1 aBruwer, Chriselle1 aGough, Charlotte1 aBunce, M.

Carps with an initial weight 500 ± 20 g were randomly divided into two treatments: commercial feed group (CFG) and faba bean group (FBG). Compared to CFG, the results indicated that carps fed with faba bean had poor growth performance, higher intramuscular collagen content, smaller fiber diameter and wider intermyofibrillar space. However, the fiber density was not influenced (P > 0.05). The faba bean components showed lower crude protein and amino acid imbalance, especially, the deficiency in the sulfuric amino acid. The raw-fillet and cooked-fillet texture of FBG were both significantly greater than that of CFG (P < 0.05). Muscle fiber diameter and cooked-fillet texture showed significant negative correlation (P < 0.05), significant positive correlation between intramuscular collagen content and cooked-fillet texture (P < 0.05), and no significant correlation between muscle fiber density and fillet texture (P> 0.05). In summary, faba bean could improve the fillet quality for Yellow River carp. These findings would contribute to define the optimal nutritional conditions of pond culture to improve the flesh quality of Cyprinus carpio haematopterus.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCyprinus carpio 3aVicia faba 3aamino acids 3acarp 3acollagen 3acrude protein 3afaba beans 3afillet quality 3afillets 3agrowth performance 3ameat quality 3amuscle fibers 3amuscles 3aoptimal nutrition 3apond culture 3atexture 3aYellow River 0aC. carpio haematopterus 0aCFG 0aFBG 0aLHC 0aTPA 0aMet 0aCys 0aPro 0aVal 0aLeu 0aIle 0aHyp 0aND 0aFaba bean 0aGrowth performance 0aFillet texture 0aCyprinus carpio haematopterus1 aYun, Yinghao1 aMi, Jiali1 aLuo, Jiaxiang1 aJin, Min1 aNie, Guoxing1 aZhou, Qicun0 tAquaculture reports.g2020 July, v. 17 p.100379-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23215x2352-51347nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aqrep.2020.1003793Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02171naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004400094040001800138100002100156245011300177300001600290500001900306500002000325520099100345592002801336650002101364650001201385650001501397650001201412650001101424650001101435650000901446650001101455650001001466700002101476700001601497700002001513700002301533773011801556856009001674852000901764655001201773IND60734439620221118042211.0210418e199303  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073443962DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1469-8137.1993.tb03766.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBHATTI, A.

Plants grown in a salt‐affected, reclaimed field, in a solution culture and in soil in pots at 10, 100 and 125 mM NaCl have been analyzed. Despite the presence of salt‐secreting glands on Leptochloa fusca leaves, Na concentrations increased strongly with leaf age, while K concentrations were highest in young leaves and decreased with increasing leaf age. This was due to K retranslocation, which was clearly intensified at higher external NaCl concentration. The data point to the importance of K recycling in this halophyte and also to the use of Na by this salt‐secreting species for turgor maintenance in mature and old leaves. Both Mg and particularly Ca concentrations increased with leaf age, indicating that xylem import surpassed phloem export even for the phloem‐mobile ion, Mg. In young leaves, Mg concentrations exceeded those of Ca.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLeptochloa fusca 3agrasses 3ahalophytes 3aimports 3aleaves 3aphloem 3asoil 3aturgor 3axylem1 aSTEINERT, SABINE1 aSarwar, G.,1 aHILPERT, ANDREA1 aJESCHKE, W.

We hypothesized that lamb (Ovis aries L.) CUM recorded at time t was a function of herbage quality and/or quantity measured at a previous harvest t − x (where x = days prior to measurement of CUM). Our objectives were (i) to determine if time series regression analysis (TSR) could be used to model CUM from three irrigated wheatgrasses, ‘Hycrest’ [Agropyron cristatum (L.) Gaertner × A. desertorum (Fischer ex Link) Shulters], ‘Luna’ [Thinopyrum intermedium subsp. barbulatum (Schur) Barkw. and D.R Dewey], and ‘Jose’ [T. ponticum (Podp.) Barkw. and D.R. Dewey] grown alone and with ‘Renumex’ sainfoin (Onobrychis viciifolia Scop.), and (ii) to test the models. Replicated pastures grown on a fine, mixed thermic Torrertic Paleustolls were rotationally grazed by Rambouillet × Suffolk wether lambs for an average of 77 d in spring of 1987 and 1988. Herbage quality, quantity, and plant parts were estimated from pregrazing, after 2 and 4 d of grazing, and postgrazing (7 d) harvests and used as variables in TSR. For TSR models, lagged variables (t − x) were selected more (67–92% of total) than nonlagged variables (t), supporting our hypothesis. Time series regression models described CUM accurately (average R² > 0.70), but selected variables were not consistent among treatments, time lags, or years. Model testing indicated poor predictive accuracy (r² = 0.07−0.51), limiting the usefulness of projecting CUM across seasons and demonstrating the necessity of testing regression models.

(fruit extract) on methotrexate-induced toxicities—hematological and biochemical studies  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aMethotrexate (MTX) has been widely used as an anticancer drug. It acts as a folic acid analog, inhibits purine and pyrimidine synthesis, which accounts for its efficacy in the therapy of cancer as well as for some of its toxicities. The present study is an attempt of modulating MTX-induced toxicities using aqueous extract of Morinda citrifolia L. (Noni) as a nutritional supplement. Hematological parameters such as RBC, WBC, and platelet count that decreased (p < 0.05) after methotrexate injection was found to have been restored in rats co-treated with Noni. Enhanced levels of lipid peroxides (p < 0.05) in animals administered with MTX showed significant revision after co-administration of Noni. Alterations of other biochemical constituents in blood like glucose, urea, uric acid, and cholesterol (p < 0.05) were also reversed to near normal levels in animals co-treated with Morinda citrifolia L. The study provides preliminary evidence that Morinda citrifolia L. extract can ameliorate MTX mediated side effects.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMorinda citrifolia 3ablood platelet count 3acholesterol 3afolic acid 3afruit extracts 3aglucose 3amethotrexate 3aprotective effect 3atherapeutics 3aurea 3auric acid 0amethotrexate toxicity 0aMorinda citrifolia L. 0aNoni1 aMarar, Thankamani1 aHsu, Tsai-Ching0 tCogent biology.g2016 Dec. 31, v. 2, no. 1 p.1207879-dCogentwJournal:27203x2331-20257nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/23312025.2016.12078793Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02668naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245014200168520125200310592002801562650001601590650001101606650002501617650001501642650001501657650001201672651001701684651001001701651001101711651001401722651001301736651001401749653001401763653002901777653001101806653002601817700005701843700002501900700006501925700002801990773011302018856008202131852000902213655001202222IND60755274520221122010423.0211123e202112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075527452DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jas.2021.1055112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAcevedo, Natalia10aProvenance study of the variscite artifacts of the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta, Colombia and approach to routes of pre-Hispanic exchange  aVariscite is a rare mineral that offers new opportunities for research on the mobility of raw materials in America during pre-Hispanic times through the provenance study of the source material. In this article we address a detailed characterization of the texture, mineralogy and chemical composition of the variscite beads belonging to the Nahuange (100–1000 AD) and Tairona (1000–1600 AD) societies of the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta region (northern Colombia), which we compare with the known deposit located in the Gran Roque Island, Venezuela. The presented evidence proves the origin of the material from this location, allowing the interpretation of the distribution models of northern South American archaeological variscite.Indeed, different findings of beads made of variscite have shown that this mineral could have a much wider distribution that extends to the Northern Andes, the Amazon basin and the Caribbean islands, though other not yet discovered geological sources cannot be discarded. This is shown by the discovery of variscite beads at the Nueva Esperanza Archaeological Site south of Bogotá and in the archaeological records of the Nariño culture (Colombia), the Amazon basin in Brazil, Aruba and the Lesser Antilles.  aPublisher supplied data 3aarchaeology 3abasins 3achemical composition 3amineralogy 3aprovenance 3atexture 3aAndes region 3aAruba 3aBrazil 3aCaribbean 3aColombia 3aVenezuela 0aVariscite 0aArchaeological artifacts 0aOrigin 0aPre-hispanic exchange1 aWeber, Marion1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4071-68771 aProenza, Joaquín A.1 aGarcia-Casco, Antonio1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8814-402X1 aSáenz Samper, Juanita,0 tJournal of archaeological science.g2021 Dec., v. 136 p.105511-dElsevier LtdwJournal:3403x0305-44037nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jas.2021.1055113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02313naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002500151245010200176300001800278520074000296592002801036650003001064650001101094650001201105650001801117650003001135653000701165653000801172653000801180653000801188653000701196653000901203653001001212653000801222653000801230653000901238653000801247653002001255653003301275653005301308653001901361653001601380700001601396700001901412700002101431700002501452700002401477700001901501773015601520856008601676852000901762655001201771IND60539351420221117224515.0190215e20151221xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053935142DNAL7 a10.1016/j.febslet.2015.11.0322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTakahashi, Kaneyoshi10aMapping the heparin-binding site of the osteoinductive protein NELL1 by site-directed mutagenesis  ap. 4026-4032.  aNeural epidermal growth factor-like (NEL)-like 1 (NELL1) is a secretory osteogenic protein comprising an N-terminal thrombospondin-1-like (TSPN) domain, four von Willebrand factor type C domains, and six epidermal growth factor-like repeats. NELL1 shows heparin-binding activity; however, the biological significance remains to be explored. In this report, we demonstrate that NELL1 binds to cell surface proteoglycans through its TSPN domain. Major heparin-binding sites were identified on the three-dimensional structural model of the TSPN domain of NELL1. Mutant analysis of the heparin-binding sites indicated that the heparin-binding activity of the TSPN domain is involved in interaction of NELL1 with cell surface proteoglycans.  aPublisher supplied data 3ablood coagulation factors 3amodels 3amutants 3aproteoglycans 3asite-directed mutagenesis 0aDS 0aEGF 0aECM 0aGAG 0aHS 0aHSPG 0aNELL1 0aOVA 0aTSP 0aTSPN 0aVWC 0aHeparin-binding 0aHeparan sulfate proteoglycan 0aNeural epidermal growth factor-like (NEL)-like 1 0aThrombospondin 0aTSPN domain1 aImai, Arisa1 aIijima, Masumi1 aYoshimoto, Nobuo1 aMaturana, Andrés D.1 aKuroda, Shun’ichi1 aNiimi, Tomoaki0 tFEBS letters.g2015 Dec. 21, v. 589, no. 24 p.4026-4032dElsevier B.V.aFederation of European Biochemical SocietieswJournal:jnl16404x0014-57937nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.febslet.2015.11.0323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01946naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001300151245006600164300001600230520085100246592002801097650002201125650001901147650001101166650001501177650002201192650001601214651001101230653002201241653001301263653001301276653001401289700001801303700001601321773014001337856008601477852000901563655001201572IND60739470320221120132725.0211105e20210504xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073947032DNAL7 a10.1080/19315260.2020.17161282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDube, J.10aWatermelon production in Africa: challenges and opportunities  ap. 211-219.  aThere is a growing realization in African countries for the need to enhance the production of xerophytic crops, including Watermelon, Citrullus lanatus L., in the face of climate change. The objective of this review is to explore challenges and opportunities in watermelon production in Africa. Watermelon is adaptable to most of tropical, and subtropical, Africa, due to its low water requirement and has the potential to be a commercial crop. However, minimal research has been applied to its breeding and production in the continent. Lack of improved varieties, poor production systems, perishable nature of the fruit, and lack of harvest and post-harvest preservation technology hamper large-scale production. Research, particularly in watermelon production practices and breeding, is needed if its true potential in Africa is to be realized.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCitrullus lanatus 3aclimate change 3afruits 3avegetables 3awater requirement 3awatermelons 3aAfrica 0aCitrullus lanatus 0acucurbit 0alycopene 0axerophyte1 aDdamulira, G.1 aMaphosa, M.0 tInternational journal of vegetable science.g2021 May 04, v. 27, no. 3 p.211-219dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl4027179x1931-52797nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/19315260.2020.17161283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02692naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004400092040001800136100002800154245010400182300001600286500001700302520108600319592002801405650001201433650002501445650001101470650001301481650001201494650001601506650001401522650002501536650002401561650000901585650001001594650002401604650001301628650001401641650001001655650001001665650001301675650001601688650001601704650002601720650002101746650001501767650002001782650001401802700002001816700001601836700002001852700002001872773013401892852000902026856009102035655001202126IND4373289820221120101048.0211202e200402  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437328982DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1748-5827.2004.tb00212.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSaridomichelakis, M.

On clinical examination, subcutaneous oedema, purpura and ascites were detected along with a palpable mass in the right craniodorsal abdomen. Laboratory findings included regenerative anaemia, leucocytosis, thrombocytopenia, azotaemia, increased blood serum alkaline phosphatase and proteinuria. Radiographic and ultrasonographic examinations revealed a large neoplasm involving the right kidney. Computed tomography further showed that the neoplastic tissue had spread into the lymph nodes, the wall of the caudal vena cava, the liver and lungs. The right renal vein, caudal vena cava and iliac veins appeared enlarged and secondarily thrombosed. A diagnosis was made of renal tubular cell carcinoma with secondary venous thrombosis. Gross postmortem examination confirmed the imaging findings, while light and electron microscopic examination revealed that the neoplasm was a solid carcinoma originating from the proximal convoluted renal tubules.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabdomen 3aalkaline phosphatase 3aanemia 3aanorexia 3aascites 3ablood serum 3acarcinoma 3aclinical examination 3acomputed tomography 3adogs 3aedema 3aelectron microscopy 3aexercise 3ahematuria 3aliver 3alymph 3anecropsy 3aproteinuria 3aradiography 3asmall animal practice 3athrombocytopenia 3athrombosis 3aultrasonography 3avena cava1 aKoutinas, C.

It was shown Tat induced HIV-1 transactivation through inhibiting EZH2 activity. Tat decreased the levels of H3K27me3 and EZH2 occupy at the long terminal repeat (LTR) of HIV-1. We further showed for the first time that transfected with Tat construct resulted in an increase in phosphorylated EZH2 (p-EZH2), mediated by active Akt. ROS/Akt-dependent p-EZH2 was correlated with Tat-induced transactivation. Our study reveals that novel mechanisms allow Tat-induced HIV-1 transactivation by ROS/Akt-dependent downregulating the EZH2 epigenetic silencing machinery.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHuman immunodeficiency virus 1 3aepigenetics 3aphosphorylation 3asignal transduction 3aterminal repeat sequences 3atranscriptional activation 0aHIV-1 0aEnhancer of zeste homolog 2 0aReactive oxygen species 0aAKT1 aLiu, Yang1 aWu, Tong-Chao1 aDu, Guang-Yuan1 aZhang, Feng-Juan0 tFEBS letters.g2015 Dec. 21, v. 589, no. 24 p.4106-4111dElsevier B.V.aFederation of European Biochemical SocietieswJournal:jnl16404x0014-57937nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.febslet.2015.11.0333Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02290naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245013600171500001900307520101200326592002801338650002701366650002401393650001401417650001101431650001401442650002101456650001301477650001201490650002101502650002501523651001001548653001301558653002601571700001801597700001901615700002101634700002001655773009801675856008601773852000901859655001201868IND60691275820221121233525.0210313e20161231xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069127582DNAL7 a10.1080/23312025.2016.12184122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPant, Aakanksha10aSyzygium aromaticum (L.) elicits lifespan extension and attenuates age-related Aβ-induced proteotoxicity in Caenorhabditis elegans  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aClove (Syzygium aromaticum) is a popular medicinal plant which has been traditionally used in India as spice and medicine to counter various ailments. However, the stress modulatory and antiaging potential of this plant is yet to be characterized. Therefore, the present study evaluates the effect of clove oil (CO) on oxidative stress, lifespan, mobility, and the expression of aging-related proteins using Caenorhabditis elegans model system. The CO (10 ppm) was found to extend mean lifespan in worms by 21.4% (p < 0.001) under normal and by 63% (p < 0.0001) under juglone-induced oxidative stress conditions. The extension of mean lifespan in mev-1 mutant and elevated expression of gst-4 and sod-3 confirmed stress modulatory effects of CO. Additionally, the CO reduced intracellular ROS and Aβ₁–₄₂ proteotoxicity. Altogether, the present study unravels the anti-aging and stress modulatory potential of CO and suggests CO as a potential pharmaceutical entity in modulating aging process.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCaenorhabditis elegans 3aSyzygium aromaticum 3aclove oil 3acloves 3alongevity 3amedicinal plants 3amedicine 3amutants 3aoxidative stress 3asuperoxide dismutase 3aIndia 0alifespan 0aAlzheimer’s disease1 aPrakash, Prem1 aPandey, Rakesh1 aKumar, Rishendra1 aHsu, Tsai-Ching0 tCogent biology.g2016 Dec. 31, v. 2, no. 1 p.1218412-dCogentwJournal:27203x2331-20257nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/23312025.2016.12184123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02508naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100002000154245009200174300001600266520128500282592002801567650002301595650001101618650001301629650001601642650003501658650002001693650001101713650002201724650001701746650001401763650001701777650001901794650001901813650001301832700002801845700001601873773011201889856008802001852000902089655001202098IND60113800520221120042953.0141112e201212  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011380052DNAL7 a10.1016/j.molbiopara.2012.10.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSiricoon, Sinee10aEfficient inhibition of cathepsin B by a secreted type 1 cystatin of Fasciola gigantica  ap. 126-133.  aCysteine proteases are important antigens in the liver fluke genus Fasciola, essential for infection, protection and nutrition. While their biochemistry, biological roles and application as vaccines have been thoroughly studied there is a lack of data concerning their regulation. In the present study we have continued our investigation of cysteine protease inhibitors in Fasciola gigantica and demonstrate, in comparison with FgStefin-1 and human cystatin C, that a second type 1 cystatin of the parasite, FgStefin-2, has been evolutionary adapted to block cathepsin B. The protein, which unusually for a type 1 cystatin carries a signal peptide, is expressed from the metacercarial to adult stage and located in the epithelial cells of the intestinal tract in all stages and in the prostate gland cells in adults. Both cell types may contribute to the released FgStefin-2 observed in the ES product of the parasite. Distinct isoforms of cathepsin B are essential for host tissue penetration during the early infection process and FgStefin-2 may act as key regulator, required to protect the minute juvenile from autoproteolysis. Expression in the prostate gland in the adult stage suggests an additional regulative role of cysteine protease activity in the reproductive system.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFasciola gigantica 3aadults 3aantigens 3acathepsin B 3acysteine proteinase inhibitors 3aenzyme activity 3ahumans 3aintestinal mucosa 3aliver flukes 3anutrition 3aparasitology 3aprostate gland 3asignal peptide 3avaccines1 aGrams, Suksiri Vichasri1 aGrams, Rudi0 tMolecular and biochemical parasitology.g2012 Dec., v. 186, no. 2 p.126-133dElsevier B.V.x0166-68517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.molbiopara.2012.10.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02468naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245011400171300001800285520068800303592002800991650002101019650001701040650002201057650001501079650001501094650001501109650001801124653000701142653000701149653001601156653001601172653000801188653001301196653000701209653003601216653003501252653003001287653002601317653003801343653003501381700002101416700005901437700001801496700002301514700002201537700002301559700002001582700006101602773015601663856008601819852000901905655001201914IND60539351620221117224455.0190215e20151221xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053935162DNAL7 a10.1016/j.febslet.2015.11.0342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTsuda, Tomohiro10aCharacterization and crystal structure determination of β-1,2-mannobiose phosphorylase from Listeria innocua  ap. 3816-3821.  aGlycoside hydrolase family 130 consists of phosphorylases and hydrolases for β-mannosides.

ET regulated the key antioxidant enzymes, especially ascorbate peroxidase (APX), in WT but in the mutant fruits the activity of APX did not change and the superoxide dismutase and catalase activities were downregulated compared to untreated controls after salt treatment contributing to a higher degree of oxidative stress in Nr fruits. The dependency of PA metabolism on the active ET signalling was investigated for the first time in fruits of Nr mutants under salt stress. 75 mM NaCl enhanced the accumulation of spermine in WT fruits, which was not observed in Nr, but levels of putrescine and spermidine were elevated by salt stress in these tissues. Moreover, the catabolism of PAs was much stronger under high salinity in Nr fruits contributing to higher oxidative stress, which was only partially alleviated by the increased total and reduced ascorbate and glutathione pool. We can conclude that ET-mediated signalling plays a crucial role in the regulation of salt-induced oxidative stress and PA levels in tomato fruits at the mature stage.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aascorbate peroxidase 3acatabolism 3acatalase 3aethylene 3aglutathione 3alipid peroxidation 3amutants 3aoxidative stress 3aplant physiology 3aputrescine 3asalinity 3asalt stress 3aspermidine 3aspermine 3astress response 3asuperoxide dismutase 3atomatoes 0aAntioxidants 0aEthylene 0aFruit 0aNever ripe 0aPolyamines 0aTomato1 aCzékus, Zalán1 aTari, Irma1 aPoór, Péter1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4539-63580 tJournal of plant physiology.g2022 Oct., v. 277 p.153793-dElsevier GmbHwJournal:jnl39020x0176-16177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jplph.2022.1537933Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03232naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001600152245014900168520184200317592002802159650001102187650001202198650002202210650002002232650002202252650001102274650001602285650002002301650001602321650001502337653005302352653002702405653002302432653004102455653003802496700001902534700001602553700001802569700001702587773009802604856008702702852000902789655001202798IND60755274820221122010340.0211213e20220115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075527482DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apenergy.2021.1180342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Yuwei10aWasserstein and multivariate linear affine based distributionally robust optimization for CCHP-P2G scheduling considering multiple uncertainties  aPower-to-gas is an emerging energy conversion technology. When integrating power-to-gas into the combined cooling, heating and power system, renewable generations can be further accommodated to synthesize natural gas, and additional revenues can be obtained by reutilizing and selling the synthesized gas. Therefore, it is necessary to address the optimal operation issue of the integrated system (Combined cooling, heating and power-Power-to-gas) for bringing the potential benefits, and thus promoting energy transition. This paper proposes a Wasserstein and multivariate linear affine based distributionally robust optimization model for the above issue considering multiple uncertainties. Specifically, the uncertain distribution of wind power and electric, thermal, cooling loads is modeled as an ambiguity set by applying the Wasserstein metric. Then, based on the ambiguity set, the proposed model with two-stage structure is established. In the first-stage, system operation cost (involving the energy exchange and carbon emission costs, etc.) is minimized under the forecast information. In the second stage, for resisting the interference of multiple uncertainties, the multivariate linear affine policy models are constructed for operation rescheduling under the worst-case distribution within the ambiguity set, which is capable of adjusting flexible resources according to various random factors simultaneously. Simulations are implemented and verify that: 1) both the economic and environmental benefits of system operation are improved by integrating power-to-gas; 2) the proposed model keeps both the conservativeness and computational complexity at low levels, and its solutions enable the effective system operation in terms of cost saving, emission reduction, uncertainty resistance and renewable energy accommodation.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon 3acooling 3aenergy conversion 3aenergy transfer 3aissues and policy 3amodels 3anatural gas 3aoperating costs 3auncertainty 3awind power 0aCombined cooling, heating and power-Power-to-gas 0aMultiple uncertainties 0aWasserstein metric 0aDistributionally robust optimization 0aMultivariate linear affine policy1 aYang, Yuanjuan1 aFei, Haoran1 aSong, Minghao1 aJia, Mengyao0 tApplied energy.g2022 Jan. 15, v. 306 p.118034-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11876x0306-26197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2021.1180343Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03154naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100002200188245010600210300001800316506007600334520171400410592002802124506003702152650001002189650002102199650002802220650001102248650001902259650001202278653000802290653000902298653000902307653001302316653000902329653001002338653000902348653001202357653000802369653001202377653000902389653002202398700001902420700002002439773009902459856008102558852000902639655001202648IND60528771020221207083746.0160716e20160424xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052877102DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jmb.2016.03.0062doi7 aPMC48352592pmcid7 a269969392pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChin, Samantha M.10aTIRF microscopy analysis of human Cof1, Cof2, and ADF effects on actin filament severing and turnover  ap. 1604-1616.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aDynamic remodeling and turnover of cellular actin networks requires actin filament severing by actin-depolymerizing factor (ADF)/Cofilin proteins. Mammals express three different ADF/Cofilins (Cof1, Cof2, and ADF), and genetic studies suggest that in vivo they perform both overlapping and unique functions. To gain mechanistic insights into their different roles, we directly compared their G-actin and F-actin binding affinities, and quantified the actin filament severing activities of human Cof1, Cof2, and ADF using in vitro total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy. All three ADF/Cofilins had similar affinities for G-actin and F-actin. However, Cof2 and ADF severed filaments much more efficiently than Cof1 at both lower and higher concentrations and using either muscle or platelet actin. Furthermore, Cof2 and ADF were more effective than Cof1 in promoting “enhanced disassembly” when combined with actin disassembly co-factors Coronin-1B and actin-interacting protein 1 (AIP1), and these differences were observed on both preformed and actively growing filaments. To probe the mechanism underlying these differences, we used multi-wavelength total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy to directly observe Cy3–Cof1 and Cy3–Cof2 interacting with actin filaments in real time during severing. Cof1 and Cof2 each bound to filaments with similar kinetics, yet Cof2 induced severing much more rapidly than Cof1, decreasing the time interval between initial binding on a filament and severing at the same location. These differences in ADF/Cofilin activities and mechanisms may be used in cells to tune filament turnover rates, which can vary widely for different actin structures.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aactin 3abinding capacity 3afluorescence microscopy 3ahumans 3amicrofilaments 3amuscles 0aADF 0aCof1 0aCof2 0aSrv2/CAP 0aAIP1 0aCor1B 0aTIRF 0aCofilin 0aADF 0aCoronin 0aAIP1 0aactin disassembly1 aJansen, Silvia1 aGoode, Bruce L.0 tJournal of Molecular Biology.g2016 Apr. 24, v. 428 p.1604-1616dElsevier Ltdx0022-28367nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jmb.2016.03.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02370naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094024002200126024001900148040001800167100001800185245004000203300001300243500001500256506007600271520120900347592002801556506003701584650002201621650002001643650001201663650001701675650001001692650001501702650001501717653001101732700001901743700001801762773010501780856007801885852000901963655001201972IND60119537620221207061150.0141214e200601  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011953762DNAL7 a10.1186/gb-2006-7-1-r32doi7 aPMC14317132pmcid7 a165071352pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWeir, Michael10aChallenging the spliceosome machine  ap. 1271.  a2019-12-04  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: Using cDNA copies of transcripts and corresponding genomic sequences from the Berkeley Drosophila Genome Project, a set of 24,753 donor and acceptor splice sites were computed with a scanning algorithm that tested for single nucleotide insertion, deletion and substitution polymorphisms. Using this dataset, we developed a progressive partitioning approach to examining the effects of challenging the spliceosome system. RESULTS: Our analysis shows that information content increases near splice sites flanking progressively longer introns and exons, suggesting that longer splice elements require stronger binding of spliceosome components. Information also increases at splice sites near very short introns and exons, suggesting that short splice elements have crowding problems. We observe that the information found at individual splice sites depends upon a balance of splice element lengths in the vicinity, including both flanking and non-adjacent introns and exons. CONCLUSION: These results suggest an interdependence of multiple splicing events along the pre-mRNA, which may have implications for how the macromolecular spliceosome machine processes sets of neighboring splice sites.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3acomplementary DNA 3adata collection 3aintrons 3aspliceosomes 3aexons 3aalgorithms 3aDrosophila 0agenome1 aEaton, Matthew1 aRice, Michael0 tGenome biology.g2006 Jan., v. 7, no. 1 p.1271-1271dSpringer-VerlagwJournal:19127x1474-760X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1186/gb-2006-7-1-r33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03236naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245016300163520151700326592002801843650001601871650001601887650001501903650001501918650002301933650003001956650001601986650002002002650001802022650001102040650000702051650001502058650002202073650002302095650002802118650001602146650002502162650002502187650002002212653001502232653001602247653001202263653002802275653001802303653003002321700002202351700002302373700001902396700002002415700002402435773012002459856008202579852000902661655001202670IND60697167220221122070443.0210108e202010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069716722DNAL7 a10.1016/j.gsd.2020.1004162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAarab, Nouh10aRemoval of an emerging pharmaceutical pollutant (metronidazole) using PPY-PANi copolymer: Kinetics, equilibrium and DFT identification of adsorption mechanism  aPresent study reports the synthesis of the polyaniline-polypyrrole (PPY-PANi) copolymer and its subsequent application for aqueous metronidazole removal under batch adsorption trials. The experiments were then performed to determine the influence of different adsorption parameters such as adsorbent dose, pH, reaction time, initial concentration and temperature on the adsorption process. The obtained experimental data was further evaluated by using different kinetic, isotherm and thermodynamic modeling. The pseudo-first order model provided the satisfactorily explanation for metronidazole kinetic adsorption over PPY-PANi adsorbent. The equilibrium experimental data was in good agreement with Freundlich model. The thermodynamic parameters reveal that the adsorption was spontaneous and exothermic in nature. Metronidazole adsorption mechanism over PPY-PANi surface sites was further evaluated by employing density functional theory (DFT) method. The calculated data indicated that the metronidazole adsorption was mainly accomplished via nucleophilic groups (containing oxygen atoms) of metronidazole over the electrophilic attack sites (-NH-) of PPY-PANi adsorbent. The interaction energy bond clearly suggests that the adsorption of metronidazole over PPY-PANi is a physisorption in nature. Thus, based on these above-mentioned experimental results and DFT data, we concluded that PPY-PANi copolymer could be taken as an alternative filter material for pharmaceutical contaminated wastewater treatment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLewis acids 3aLewis bases 3aadsorbents 3aadsorption 3acomposite polymers 3adensity functional theory 3agroundwater 3aheat production 3ametronidazole 3aoxygen 3apH 3apollutants 3apollution control 3asorption isotherms 3asustainable development 3atemperature 3athermodynamic models 3awastewater treatment 3awater pollution 0aAdsorption 0aEquilibrium 0aKinetic 0aPolyaniline-polypyrrole 0aMetronidazole 0aDensity functional theory1 aHsini, Abdelghani1 aEssekri, Abdelilah1 aLaabd, Mohamed1 aLakhmiri, Rajae1 aAlbourine, Abdallah0 tGroundwater for sustainable development.g2020 Oct., v. 11 p.100416-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23351x2352-801X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gsd.2020.1004163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03124naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001600155245015900171520130000330592002801630650002801658650003601686650002201722650002301744650001601767650001301783650002201796650001101818650002001829650002701849650001001876650004201886650001601928650001001944650002401954650002101978650001401999650001302013650005202026650002402078650001102102650002502113650002402138653000902162653000902171653003202180653002302212700001602235700001802251700001602269700001802285700001602303700001302319773009102332856009002423852000902513655001202522IND60688318220221121041741.0200628e202008  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068831822DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2020.1266542doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXie, Jiajun10aIdentification of heme oxygenase-1 from golden pompano (Trachinotus ovatus) and response of Nrf2/HO-1 signaling pathway to copper-induced oxidative stress  aHeme oxygenase-1(HO-1) is a stress-inducible enzyme that mediates antioxidative and cytoprotective effects to maintain cellular redox homeostasis. In the present study, the full sequence of HO-1 was cloned from golden pompano(Trachinotus ovatus) by RT-PCR and RACE-PCR. The full cDNA sequence of HO-1 was 1349 bp in length which comprised of a 726 bp open reading frame (ORF) preceded by 262 bp 5′-untranslated region (UTR), and followed by a 360 bp 3′UTR, encoding 241 amino acid residues. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that HO-1 showed highest similarity to that of Takifugu rubripes. Tissue distribution analysis showed that the expression level of HO-1 was relatively high in heart, liver and spleen. A trial was conducted to investigate the response of Nrf2/HO-1 signaling pathway to oxidative stress induced by copper. The results showed that mRNA expression of NF-E2-related nuclear factor2 (Nrf2), Kelch-like-ECH-associated protein1 (keap1), superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), HO-1, NAD(P)H quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1) and Glutathione peroxidase (GSH-PX) all significantly increased in copper treated group than that in the control group.

Pers.] requires stand establishment by vegetative means. Sprigs (rhizomes and rooted stolons) are the method of choice, but vegetative culms (cuttings) are often used because of lower planting material costs. Two studies, one in raised beds in a greenhouse (1987 and 1989) and one under field conditions (1989), were conducted during the summers of those yean to investigate differences in survival of cuttings from four hybrid bermudagrass cultivars at 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 wk of age. In raised beds, percent survival of Coastal (4%) was higher than Grazer (31%) and Tiffon-44 (24%); Brazos (41%) was higher than Tiffon-44. Cutting length and number of nodes were related to survival and reduced the proportion of variation in percent survival attributable to cutting age when included in analysis of variance models as covariates. Grazer and Brazos bad higher survival than Coastal and Tifton-44 after adjusting data for cutting length. A cultivar-×-age interaction affected survival in the field study. All the above results were significant at P < 0.05.

Transgenic P. falciparum parasites expressing luciferase have been created to study drug interventions of both asexual and sexual blood stages but luciferase-expressing mosquito stage and liver stage parasites have not been created which has prevented the easy quantification of mosquito stage development (e.g. for transmission blocking interventions) and liver stage development (for interventions that prevent infection). To overcome this obstacle, we have created a transgenic P. falciparum NF54 parasite that expresses a GFP–luciferase transgene throughout the life cycle. Luciferase expression is robust and measurable at all life cycle stages, including midgut oocyst, salivary gland sporozoites and liver stages, where in vivo development is easily measurable using humanized mouse infections in conjunction with an in vivo imaging system. This parasite reporter strain will accelerate testing of interventions against pre-erythrocytic life cycle stages.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCulicidae 3aPlasmodium falciparum 3ablood 3adrugs 3agenetically modified organisms 3ahumans 3aimage analysis 3aliver 3aluciferase 3amice 3amidgut 3aoocysts 3aparasites 3aparasitology 3asalivary glands 3asporozoites 3atransgenes1 aMikolajczak, Sebastian A.1 aCamargo, Nelly1 aLakshmanan, Viswanathan1 aKennedy, Mark1 aLindner, Scott E.1 aMiller, Jessica L.1 aHume, Jen C.C.1 aKappe, Stefan H.I.0 tMolecular and biochemical parasitology.g2012 Dec., v. 186, no. 2 p.143-147dElsevier B.V.x0166-68517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.molbiopara.2012.10.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02959naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100001800142245014500160300001800305520152300323592002801846650001201874650001001886650002901896650000901925650002601934650001701960650001501977650002201992650001402014650002202028700001502050700001702065700001802082700002002100700001902120700001902139700002002158700001702178700001802195700005702213773014602270856007602416852000902492655001202501IND60683927020221120031902.0200213e20200106xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068392702DNAL7 a10.1021/jacs.9b117192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Jun-Nan10aPotassium Bromide Surface Passivation on CsPbI₃₋ₓBrₓ Nanocrystals for Efficient and Stable Pure Red Perovskite Light-Emitting Diodes  ap. 2956-2967.  aAll-inorganic lead halide perovskite nanocrystals (NCs) are potential candidates for fabricating high-performance light-emitting diodes (LEDs) owing to their precisely tunable bandgaps, high photoluminescence (PL) efficiency, and excellent color purities. However, the performance of pure red (630–640 nm) all-inorganic perovskite LEDs is still limited by the halide segregation-induced instability of the electroluminescence (EL) of mixed halide CsPbI₃₋ₓBrₓ NCs. Herein, we report an effective approach to improving the EL stability of pure red all-inorganic CsPbI₃₋ₓBrₓ NC-based LEDs via the passivation of potassium bromide on NCs. By adding potassium oleate to the reaction system, we obtained potassium bromide surface-passivated (KBr-passivated) CsPbI₃₋ₓBrₓ NCs with pure red PL emission and a photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) exceeding 90%. We determine that most potassium ions present on the surface of NCs bind with bromide ions and thus demonstrate that potassium bromide surface passivation of NCs can both improve the PL stability and inhibit the halide segregation of NCs. Using KBr-passivated CsPbI₃₋ₓBrₓ NCs as an emitting layer, we fabricated stable and pure red perovskite LEDs with emission at 637 nm, showing a maximum brightness of 2671 cd m–², maximum external quantum efficiency of 3.55%, and good EL stability. The proposed KBr-passivated NC strategy will open a new avenue for fabricating efficient, stable, and tunable pure color perovskite NC LEDs.  aPublisher supplied data 3acations 3acolor 3aelectrochemiluminescence 3alead 3alight emitting diodes 3ananocrystals 3aoleic acid 3aphotoluminescence 3apotassium 3apotassium bromide1 aSong, Yang1 aYao, Ji-Song1 aWang, Kun-Hua1 aWang, Jing-Jing1 aZhu, Bai-Sheng1 aYao, Ming-Ming1 aSami ur Rahman,1 aLan, Yi-Feng1 aFan, Feng-Jia1 aYao, Hong-Bin1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2901-01600 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2020 Jan. 06, v. 142, no. 6 p.2956-2967dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19166x1520-51267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jacs.9b117193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03299naa a2200721 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003800113040001800151100001800169245010600187300001800293520126300311592002801574650000801602650001601610650002501626650001101651650001701662650001301679650001001692650001001702650001001712650001301722650001101735650002401746650001401770650000901784650002201793650001101815650001001826650001301836650001001849650003301859650001201892650001801904650001101922650002001933650001301953650001101966650002801977650001402005650003602019650000902055650004102064650004802105650002302153650002702176650002002203650002902223650002902252651001002281651001002291700001802301700002002319700002402339773010902363856008402472852000902556655001202565IND60099498120221117174317.0141105e201212  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009949812DNAL7 a228716512pmid7 a10.1016/j.meegid.2012.06.0162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSuzuki, Tohru10aPhylogenetic analysis of nonstructural protein 5 (NSP5) gene sequences in porcine rotavirus B strains  ap. 1661-1668.  aPorcine rotavirus B (RVB) has frequently been detected in the diarrhea of suckling and weaned pigs. Because it is difficult to propagate RVBs serially in cell culture, little genetic information about RNA segments other than VP7, NSP1 and NSP2 is available for porcine RVBs. We conducted a phylogenetic analysis focusing on nonstructural protein 5 (NSP5) using 22 porcine RVB strains, which were identified in fecal samples collected around Japan. Sequence analysis showed that NSP5 genes of RVBs contain one ORF, in contrast to the corresponding gene of RVAs that have two ORFs. Comparison of NSP5 amino acid sequences from porcine RVBs with other RVBs revealed that eight serine and serine/threonine residues at the N- and C-terminal regions are highly conserved among RVBs. Phylogenetic analysis also indicated the presence of six clusters (H1–H6) including rat, human, porcine and bovine plus ovine clusters with cut-off values of 78% at the nucleotide level. Moreover, the NSP5 genes of porcine RVBs were divided to three clusters. The data presented here demonstrates that several porcine RVBs with distinctive genotypes are circulating among farms throughout Japan. Our findings provide important new insights into the evolutionary dynamics of RVBs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRNA 3aRotavirus B 3aamino acid sequences 3acattle 3acell culture 3adiarrhea 3afarms 3afeces 3agenes 3agenotype 3ahumans 3aopen reading frames 3aphylogeny 3arats 3asequence analysis 3aserine 3asheep 3asuckling 3aswine 3aviral nonstructural proteins 2aAnimals 2aBase Sequence 2aCattle 2aFecesxvirology 2aGenotype 2aHumans 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPhylogeny 2aRNA, Viralxanalysisxgenetics. 2aRats 2aRotavirusxclassificationxgenetics. 2aRotavirus Infectionsxveterinaryxvirology. 2aSequence Alignment 2aSequence Analysis, RNA 2aSwinexvirology 2aSwine Diseasesxvirology 2aViral Proteinsxgenetics 3aJapan 0aJapan1 aSoma, Junichi1 aMiyazaki, Ayako1 aTsunemitsu, Hiroshi0 tInfection, genetics, and evolution.g2012 Dec., v. 12, no. 8 p.1661-1668dElsevier B.V.x1567-13487nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.meegid.2012.06.0163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02298naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004400094040001800138100001800156245009000174300001600264500001900280500002000299520114800319592002801467650001701495650001901512650002101531650002801552650001401580650001001594650001301604650001401617650001301631650001601644700001801660700001701678773011801695856009001813852000901903655001201912IND60734440320221120070843.0210418e199303  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073444032DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1469-8137.1993.tb03759.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEAGLES, C.

Unhardened plants of the three species were killed at about –6°C. The temperature at which plant mortality of hardened plants occurred was lower and was characteristic of the genotype, the hardening environment and the duration of the hardening treatment. A detailed analysis of the mode of recovery showed that the actively growing apex of the main tiller did not appear to develop increased resistance to freezing since it was killed at about –6°C in all hardening treatments. Improved survival of hardened plants at lower freezing temperatures could not be attributed to improved hardiness of the main apex but depended on the ability to establish viable regrowth from lateral tiller buds during the recovery period. This method of recovery is discussed in relation to possible physiological mechanisms of freezing tolerance including the release of apical dominance after death of the main apex and the sufficiency of post‐freezing carbon assimilation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAvena sativa 3aLolium perenne 3aapical dominance 3acarbon dioxide fixation 3acultivars 3adeath 3agenotype 3amortality 3aregrowth 3atemperature1 aWilliams, J.,1 aLOUIS, D.

The effectiveness of RNAi varies from gene to gene, however, and neuronally expressed genes are largely refractive to RNAi in wild-type worms. RESULTS: We found that C. elegans strains carrying mutations in lin-35, the worm ortholog of the tumor suppressor gene p105Rb, or a subset of the genetically related synMuv B family of chromatin-modifying genes, show increased strength and penetrance for many germline, embryonic, and post-embryonic RNAi phenotypes, including neuronal RNAi phenotypes. Mutations in these same genes also enhance somatic transgene silencing via an RNAi-dependent mechanism. Two genes, mes-4 and zfp-1, are required both for the vulval lineage defects resulting from mutations in synMuv B genes and for RNAi, suggesting a common mechanism for the function of synMuv B genes in vulval development and in regulating RNAi. Enhanced RNAi in the germline of lin-35 worms suggests that misexpression of germline genes in somatic cells cannot alone account for the enhanced RNAi observed in this strain. CONCLUSION: A worm strain with a null mutation in lin-35 is more sensitive to RNAi than any other previously described single mutant strain, and so will prove very useful for future genome-wide RNAi screens, particularly for identifying genes with neuronal functions. As lin-35 is the worm ortholog of the mammalian tumor suppressor gene p105Rb, misregulation of RNAi may be important during human oncogenesis.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aCaenorhabditis elegans 3aRNA interference 3acarcinogenesis 3agene expression 3agerm cells 3ahumans 3aloss-of-function mutation 3amutants 3aneurons 3apenetrance 3aphenotype 3ascreening 3asomatic cells 3atransgenes 3atumor suppressor genes1 aCalixto, Andrea1 aCrombie, Catriona1 aTischler, Julia1 aFortunato, Angelo1 aChalfie, Martin1 aFraser, Andrew G.,0 tGenome biology.g2006 Jan., v. 7, no. 1 p.1272-1272dSpringer-VerlagwJournal:19127x1474-760X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1186/gb-2006-7-1-r43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02309naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100001500142245008500157300001800242520107600260592002801336650000801364650001301372650001701385650001701402650003301419650001901452650001201471700001701483700004701500700001401547700001401561700001501575700002001590700001501610700005501625773014601680856007601826852000901902655001201911IND60683927120221120031928.0200213e20200122xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068392712DNAL7 a10.1021/jacs.9b117482doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRen, Kewei10aIn Situ Genetically Cascaded Amplification for Imaging RNA Subcellular Locations  ap. 2968-2974.  aIn situ amplification methods, such as hybridization chain reaction, are valuable tools for mapping the spatial distribution and subcellular location of target analytes. However, the live-cell applications of these methods are still limited due to challenges in the probe delivery, degradation, and cytotoxicity. Herein, we report a novel genetically encoded in situ amplification method to noninvasively image the subcellular location of RNA targets in living cells. In our system, a fluorogenic RNA reporter, Broccoli, was split into two nonfluorescent fragments and conjugated to the end of two RNA hairpin strands. The binding of one target RNA can then trigger a cascaded hybridization between these hairpin pairs and thus activate multiple Broccoli fluorescence signals. We have shown that such an in situ amplified strategy can be used for the sensitive detection and location imaging of various RNA targets in living bacterial and mammalian cells.

We undertook a systematic study to catalog the variant transcripts of every protein kinase-like and phosphatase-like locus of mouse http://variant.imb.uq.edu.au . RESULTS: By reviewing all available transcript evidence, we found that at least 75% of kinase and phosphatase loci in mouse generate alternative splice forms, and that 44% of these loci have well supported alternative 5' exons. In a further analysis of full-length cDNAs, we identified 69% of loci as generating more than one peptide isoform. The 1,469 peptide isoforms generated from these loci correspond to 1,080 unique Interpro domain combinations, many of which lack catalytic or interaction domains. We also report on the existence of likely dominant negative forms for many of the receptor kinases and phosphatases, including some 26 secreted decoys (seven known and 19 novel: Alk, Csf1r, Egfr, Epha1, 3, 5,7 and 10, Ephb1, Flt1, Flt3, Insr, Insrr, Kdr, Met, Ptk7, Ptprc, Ptprd, Ptprg, Ptprl, Ptprn, Ptprn2, Ptpro, Ptprr, Ptprs, and Ptprz1) and 13 transmembrane forms (four known and nine novel: Axl, Bmpr1a, Csf1r, Epha4, 5, 6 and 7, Ntrk2, Ntrk3, Pdgfra, Ptprk, Ptprm, Ptpru). Finally, by mining public gene expression data (MPSS and microarrays), we confirmed tissue-specific expression of ten of the novel isoforms. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that alternative transcripts of protein kinases and phosphatases are produced that encode different domain structures, and that these variants are likely to play important roles in phosphorylation-dependent signaling pathways.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aalternative splicing 3acomplementary DNA 3aexons 3agene expression 3aloci 3amice 3amicroarray technology 3apeptides 3aprotein kinases 3asignal transduction 3atranscription (genetics)1 aTaylor, Darrin F1 aCrowe, Mark L1 aChalk, Alistair M1 aWaddell, Nic J1 aKolle, Gabriel1 aFaulkner, Geoffrey J1 aKodzius, Rimantas1 aKatayama, Shintaro1 aWells, Christine1 aKai, Chikatoshi1 aKawai, Jun1 aCarninci, Piero1 aHayashizaki, Yoshihide1 aGrimmond, Sean M0 tGenome biology.g2006 Jan., v. 7, no. 1 p.1273-1273dSpringer-VerlagwJournal:19127x1474-760X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1186/gb-2006-7-1-r53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02089naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002000152245010900172300001600281520091900297592002801216650001001244650001801254650001101272650001401283650001101297650001101308653003101319653001301350653001801363653001801381653002201399700001901421700002001440700001801460700001901478773009801497856008701595852000901682655001201691IND60607772220221119210723.0180830e20160301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060777222DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apenergy.2015.11.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGrelet, Vincent10aTransient performance evaluation of waste heat recovery rankine cycle based system for heavy duty trucks  ap. 878-892.  aThe study presented in this paper aims to evaluate the transient performance of a waste heat recovery Rankine cycle based system for a heavy duty truck and compare it to steady state evaluation. Assuming some conditions to hold, simple thermodynamic simulations are carried out for the comparison of several fluids. Then a detailed first principle based model is also presented. Last part is focused on the Rankine cycle arrangement choice by means of model based evaluation of fuel economy for each concept where the fuels savings are computed using two methodologies. Fluid choice and concept optimization are conducted taking into account integration constraints (heat rejection, packaging, …). This paper shows the importance of the modeling phase when designing Rankine cycle based heat recovery systems and yields a better understanding when it comes to a vehicle integration of a Rankine cycle in a truck.  aPublisher supplied data 3afuels 3aheat recovery 3amodels 3apackaging 3atrucks 3awastes 0aWaste heat recovery system 0aModeling 0aThermodynamic 0aRankine cycle 0aHeavy duty trucks1 aReiche, Thomas1 aLemort, Vincent1 aNadri, Madiha1 aDufour, Pascal0 tApplied energy.g2016 Mar. 01, v. 165 p.878-892dElsevier LtdwJournal:11876x0306-26197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2015.11.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02360naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100006200142245008900204300001800293520087300311592002801184650002101212650003401233650001701267650004901284650001301333650001201346650001501358650001501373650002001388650001101408650001301419700005401432700001801486700005801504700002501562700002001587700002901607700005901636773014601695856007601841852000901917655001201926IND60683927220221120031939.0200213e20200128xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068392722DNAL7 a10.1021/jacs.9b117622doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIngersol, Laura J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3757-568X10aAddressing Ligand-Based Redox in Molybdenum-Dependent Methionine Sulfoxide Reductase  ap. 2721-2725.  aA combination of pulsed EPR, CW EPR, and X-ray absorption spectroscopies has been employed to probe the geometric and electronic structure of the E. coli periplasmic molybdenum-dependent methionine sulfoxide reductase (MsrP). ¹⁷O and ¹H pulsed EPR spectra show that the as-isolated Mo(V) enzyme form does not possess an exchangeable H₂O/OH– ligand bound to Mo as found in the sulfite oxidizing enzymes of the same family. The nature of the unusual CW EPR spectrum has been re-evaluated in light of new data on the MsrP-N45R variant and related small-molecule analogues of the active site. These data point to a novel “thiol-blocked” [(PDT)MoⱽO(SCyₛ)(thiolate)]⁻ structure, which is supported by new EXAFS data. We discuss these new results in the context of ligand-based and metal-based redox chemistry in the enzymatic oxygen atom transfer reaction.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3aX-ray absorption spectroscopy 3aactive sites 3aelectron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy 3ageometry 3aligands 3amethionine 3amolybdenum 3aoxidoreductases 3aoxygen 3asulfites1 aYang, Jing1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8241-91601 aKC, Khadanand1 aPokhrel, Amrit1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7432-83111 aAstashkin, Andrei V.1 aWeiner, Joel H.1 aJohnston, Christopher A.1 aKirk, Martin L.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1479-33180 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2020 Jan. 28, v. 142, no. 6 p.2721-2725dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19166x1520-51267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jacs.9b117623Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03444naa a2200637 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003800113040001800151100002400169245006100193300001800254520158200272592002801854650001601882650001301898650001301911650001201924650001001936650001301946650001101959650001701970650001501987650001902002650001402021650001302035650001002048650001302058650001302071650001202084650001702096650001102113650001402124650007702138650006702215650004802282650001002330650002902340650002302369651001302392651001302405700001902418700002202437700002002459700001902479700002102498700002102519700002802540700002402568773010902592856008402701852000902785655001202794IND60099498320221117164815.0141105e201212  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009949832DNAL7 a228501172pmid7 a10.1016/j.meegid.2012.07.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMladenova, Zornitsa10aDetection of rare reassortant G5P[6] rotavirus, Bulgaria  ap. 1676-1684.  aDuring the ongoing rotavirus strain surveillance program conducted in Bulgaria, an unusual human rotavirus A (RVA) strain, RVA/Human/BG/BG620/2008/G5P[6], was identified among 2200 genotyped Bulgarian RVAs. This strain showed the following genomic configuration: G5–P[6]–I1–R1–C1–M1–A8–N1–T1–E1–H1. Phylogenetic analysis of the genes encoding the neutralization proteins and backbone genes identified a probable mixture of RVA genes of human and porcine origin. The VP1, VP6 and NSP2 genes were more closely related to typical human rotavirus strains. The remaining eight genes were either closely related to typical porcine and unusual human–porcine reassortant rotavirus strains or were equally distant from reference human and porcine strains. This study is the first to report an unusual rotavirus isolate with G5P[6] genotype in Europe which has most likely emerged from zoonotic transmission. The absence of porcine rotavirus sequence data from this area did not permit to assess if the suspected ancestral zoonotic porcine strain already had human rotavirus genes in its genome when transmitted from pig to human, or, the transmission was coupled or followed by gene reassortment event(s). Because our strain shared no neutralization antigens with rotavirus vaccines used for routine immunization in children, attention is needed to monitor if this G–P combination will be able to emerge in human populations. A better understanding of the ecology of rotavirus zoonoses requires simultaneous monitoring of rotavirus strains in humans and animals.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRotavirus A 3aantigens 3achildren 3aecology 3agenes 3agenotype 3ahumans 3aimmunization 3amonitoring 3aneutralization 3aphylogeny 3aproteins 3aswine 3avaccines 3azoonoses 2aAnimals 2aGenes, Viral 2aHumans 2aPhylogeny 2aReassortant Virusesxclassificationxgeneticsxisolation & purification. 2aRotavirusxclassificationxgeneticsxisolation & purification. 2aRotavirus Infectionsxveterinaryxvirology. 2aSwine 2aSwine Diseasesxvirology 2aZoonosesxvirology 3aBulgaria 0aBulgaria1 aPapp, Hajnalka1 aLengyel, György,1 aKisfali, Péter1 aSteyer, Andrej1 aSteyer, Adela F.1 aEsona, Mathew D.1 aIturriza-Gómara, Miren1 aBányai, Krisztián0 tInfection, genetics, and evolution.g2012 Dec., v. 12, no. 8 p.1676-1684dElsevier B.V.x1567-13487nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.meegid.2012.07.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01805naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004400111040001800155100002400173245005100197300001600248500001700264520050300281592002800784650000900812650001200821650001700833650002100850650001600871650001200887650001700899650001200916650005200928650004000980650000901020650001101029650002201040650006401062700002201126773013501148852000901283856009101292655001201383IND4378434920221121200911.0211202e200512  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437843492DNAL7 a163557322pmid7 a10.1111/j.1748-5827.2005.tb00289.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aScheepens, E.

Besides morphology assays, cell microarrays should be valuable for high-throughput in situ hybridization and immunoassays, enabling new classes of genetic assays based on cell imaging.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3agenes 3aimage analysis 3aimmunoassays 3ain situ hybridization 3amicroarray technology 3amicroscopy 3aphenotype 3apheromones 3ayeasts1 aNiu, Wei1 aScouras, Alexander D.,1 aHart, G Traver1 aDavies, Jonathan1 aEllington, Andrew D.,1 aIyer, Vishwanath R1 aMarcotte, Edward M0 tGenome biology.g2006 Jan., v. 7, no. 1 p.1274-1274dSpringer-VerlagwJournal:19127x1474-760X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1186/gb-2006-7-1-r63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03118naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024005000092040001800142100001700160245008500177300001400262500000900276500001500285520177900300592002802079650002002107650001602127650001102143650001402154650002802168650002202196650002002218650002102238650002902259650001102288650001002299650001102309651001202320653002602332653001502358653002202373700002102395700001802416773012002434852000902554856009702563655001202660IND9203726320221120044618.0191122e199201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920372632DNAL7 a10.2134/agronj1992.00021962008400010008x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOussible, M.10aSubsurface Compaction Reduces the Root and Shoot Growth and Grain Yield of Wheat  ap. 34-38.  aepub  a2019-12-04  aThe recent use of heavy machinery combined with frequent disk tillage has created a subsurface compacted horizon in many of the irrigated soils of Morocco. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of subsurface compaction on the mot and shoot growth, grain yield, and grain yield components of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). Field experiments were conducted in 1982 and 1983 on a Moroccan clay loam soil (typic Calcixerolls). Soil compaction was artificially created. The 0.10-111 surface layer was removed from all plots with a road scraper. The exposed subsurface layer was then packed by making four passes over the plots with a 7.5-ton tractor. The removed soil was then replaced and leveled. Control plots were tilled with a disk plow followed by hvo passes of a disk harrow. Both compacted and control plots were then roto-tilled for final seedbed preparation. The result of this compaction was a 12 to 23% decrease in grain yield and 9 to 20% decrease in straw yield. The decrease in yield was accompanied by a consistent reduction in the number of shoots per unit area. Number of kernels per spike and kernel weight were unaffected. Both root growth and distribution were markedly changed as a result of subsurface compaction. Wheat plants in compacted plots had a denser, finer, and shallower root system than wheat plants in control plots. Plant height, and leaf area and dry matter per shoot were also unaffected. The decrease in shoot number might be attributed to a limitation in the amount of available soil N to the roots.

Due to various uncontrolled anthropogenic and industrial activities, a great number of pollutants have gained entry into the water systems. Among all the emerging contaminants, anionic species such as fluoride cause a major role in polluting the water bodies because of its high reactivity with other elements. The need for water remediation has led the research community to come up with several physicochemical and electrochemical methods to remove fluoride contamination. Among the existing methods, biosorption using bio and modified biomaterials has been extensively studied for defluoridation, as they are cheap, easily available and effectively recyclable when compared to other methods for defluoridation. Adding on, these materials are non-toxic and are safe to use compared to many other synthetic materials that are toxic and require high-cost design requirements. This review focuses on the recent developments made in the defluoridation techniques by biosorption using bio and modified biomaterials and defines the current perspectives of fluoride removal specifically using biomaterials.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiocompatible materials 3abiosorption 3adefluoridation 3aelectrochemistry 3afluorides 3ahealth hazards 3apollutants 3aremediation 3asurface water 3asynthetic products 3atoxicity 3awater pollution 0aWater contamination 0aWater purification 0aDefluoridation 0aAdsorption 0aBiosorption biomaterials 0aModified biomaterials1 aRego, Richelle M.1 aPotla, Krishna Murthy1 aKurkuri, Mahaveer D.1 aKigga, Madhuprasad0 tChemosphere.g2020 Aug., v. 253 p.126657-dElsevier LtdwJournal:1969x0045-65357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2020.1266573Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02389naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100001900142245011600161300001800277520116200295592002801457650001501485650001701500650001101517650001901528650002001547650002101567650001201588650002101600650001301621650002201634700001901656700005401675700005501729773014601784856007601930852000902006655001202015IND60683927320221120031922.0200213e20200124xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068392732DNAL7 a10.1021/jacs.9b118172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChang, Xiaoxia10aMechanistic Insights into Electroreductive C–C Coupling between CO and Acetaldehyde into Multicarbon Products  ap. 2975-2983.  aProduction of valuable multicarbon (C₃₊) products through the electrochemical CO₂ and CO reduction reactions (CO₂RR and CORR) is desirable; however, mechanistic understanding that enables C–C coupling beyond the self-coupling of CO to valuable products is lacking. In this work, we elucidate the C–C coupling mechanism between CO and acetaldehyde, a reactive intermediate in both CO₂RR and CORR, via combined isotopic labeling and in situ spectroscopic investigations. CO attacks the carbonyl carbon of acetaldehyde in the coupling, and the carbon in CO ends up in the hydroxymethyl group (−CH₂OH) of the produced 1-propanol. While the coupling between CO and acetaldehyde does occur when the CORR is conducted with added acetaldehyde, only a minor fraction (up to 36%) of 1-propanol is from this pathway, and the majority of it is produced in the CORR by the self-coupling among CO. The adsorbed methylcarbonyl is proposed as the likely intermediate where the reaction pathway bifurcates to C₂ and C₃ products; i.e., it could either be hydrogenated to acetaldehyde and ethanol or couple with CO leading to the formation of 1-propanol.  aPublisher supplied data 3a1-propanol 3aacetaldehyde 3acarbon 3acarbon dioxide 3acarbon monoxide 3aelectrochemistry 3aethanol 3aisotope labeling 3amoieties 3aspectral analysis1 aMalkani, Arnav1 aYang, Xuan1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8750-07421 aXu, Bingjun1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2303-257X0 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2020 Jan. 24, v. 142, no. 6 p.2975-2983dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19166x1520-51267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jacs.9b118173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04771naa a2200865 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003800113040001800151100002600169245016300195300001800358520199700376592002802373650002002401650002002421650002102441650001402462650002302476650001602499650001102515650001102526650001302537650001302550650001702563650001002580650002002590650002202610650001102632650001202643650002002655650001402675650001802689650001502707650001002722650007002732650006702802650004302869650001002912650002102922650005502943650005202998650002003050650001103070650005903081650002203140650001303162650002003175650001103195650001103206650000903217650002803226650004003254650003703294650004003331650003903371650001203410651001003422651002503432700003403457700002803491700002403519700003003543700002203573700003003595700001903625700002503644700002203669773010903691856008403800852000903884655001203893IND60099498420221117164732.0141105e201212  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009949842DNAL7 a229217312pmid7 a10.1016/j.meegid.2012.07.0182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPativada, Madhusudhan10aEmerging trends in the epidemiology of human astrovirus infection among infants, children and adults hospitalized with acute watery diarrhea in Kolkata, India  ap. 1685-1693.  aHuman astroviruses (HAstVs) have now emerged as another common cause of non-bacterial acute gastroenteritis (AGE) in humans worldwide. This study investigated the epidemiology and genetic diversity of human astrovirus strains circulating among infants, younger children (up to 6years), older children and adolescents (>6–17years) and adults (18years and above) hospitalized for diarrhea and their role in AGE in Kolkata, India. A total of 2535 fecal samples were screened for the presence of known enteric viral, bacterial and parasitic etiologies by conventional microbiological assays and molecular methods. The overall incidences of sole or mixed infection of HAstV with known enteric viral, bacterial and parasitic pathogens were detected in 60 cases (2.4%) among all age groups. The clinical symptoms of astrovirus-associated acute watery diarrhea cases were recorded for all sole and mixed infection cases. A high number of sole (n=13/60 [21.7%]) and mixed infection cases (n=22/60 [36.7%]) were observed in adults (18years old or more). Considering all age groups, 18 sole infection cases (n=18/60 [30%]) and 42 mixed infection cases (n=42/60 [70%]) with Rotavirus (n=11/25 [44%]), Vibrio cholerae O1 (n=6/24 [25%]) Cryptosporidium spp and Giardia lamblia (n=5/13 [38.4%]) were observed. Further, eleven HAstV samples from infants and children (up to 6years), children and adolescents (>6–17years) and adults (18years and above) were analyzed for their sequences of overlap region between ORF1b (RdRp) and ORF2 (capsid). Among these, ten strains were found to have close genetic relatedness to the Japanese strain HAstV_G1 [AB009985]. Additionally, the IDH2211 Kolkata strain showed a close genetic match with the Thai HAstV_G3 strain [EU363889]. Our study reports show that HAstVs as the sole agent and as mixed infection with other known enteric viral, bacterial, parasitic pathogens are also responsible for AGE among infants, children, adolescents and adults in Kolkata, India.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCryptosporidium 3aGiardia lamblia 3aHuman astrovirus 3aRotavirus 3aVibrio cholerae O1 3aadolescents 3aadults 3acapsid 3achildren 3adiarrhea 3aepidemiology 3afeces 3agastroenteritis 3agenetic variation 3ahumans 3ainfants 3amixed infection 3apathogens 2aAcute Disease 2aAdolescent 2aAdult 2aAstroviridaexclassificationxgeneticsxisolation & purification. 2aAstroviridae Infectionsxepidemiologyxparasitologyxvirology. 2aCaliciviridae Infectionsxepidemiology 2aChild 2aChild, Preschool 2aCoinfectionxepidemiologyxparasitologyxvirology. 2aDiarrheaxepidemiologyxparasitologyxvirology. 2aFecesxvirology 2aFemale 2aGastroenteritisxepidemiologyxparasitologyxvirology. 2aGenetic Variation 2aGenotype 2aHospitalization 2aHumans 2aInfant 2aMale 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aNorovirusxisolation & purification 2aParasitic Diseasesxepidemiology 2aRotavirusxisolation & purification 2aRotavirus Infectionsxepidemiology 2aSeasons 3aIndia 0aIndiaxepidemiology.1 aNataraju, Seegekote Mariyappa1 aGanesh, Balasubramanian1 aRajendran, Krishnan1 aRamamurthy, Thandavarayan1 aGanguly, Sandipan1 aBhattacharya, Mihir Kumar1 aGhosh, Mrinmoy1 aKobayashi, Nobumichi1 aKrishnan, Triveni0 tInfection, genetics, and evolution.g2012 Dec., v. 12, no. 8 p.1685-1693dElsevier B.V.x1567-13487nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.meegid.2012.07.0183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03433naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002300144245009000167300001600257500000900273520181100282592002802093650002902121650001502150650001202165650002902177650001802206650003002224650002502254650002702279650002702306650002002333650001402353650001902367650001302386650002702399650001502426650001502441650001602456650002902472650002002501650001802521650001402539650001902553650001202572650001802584650001202602651002002614700002102634773013602655856007902791852000902870655001202879IND60669684120221119042605.0191228e200205  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066968412DNAL7 a10.2136/sssaj2002.98802doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShepherd, Keith D.10aDevelopment of Reflectance Spectral Libraries for Characterization of Soil Properties  ap. 988-998.  aepub  aMethods for rapid estimation of soil properties are needed for quantitative assessments of land management problems. We developed a scheme for development and use of soil spectral libraries for rapid nondestructive estimation of soil properties based on analysis of diffuse reflectance spectroscopy. A diverse library of over 1000 archived topsoils from eastern and southern Africa was used to test the approach. Air-dried soils were scanned using a portable spectrometer (0.35–2.5 μm) with an artificial light source. Soil properties were calibrated to soil reflectance using multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS), and screening tests were developed for various soil fertility constraints using classification trees. A random sample of one-third of the soils was withheld for validation purposes. Validation r ² values for regressions were: exchangeable Ca, 0.88; effective cation-exchange capacity (ECEC), 0.88; exchangeable Mg, 0.81; organic C concentration, 0.80; clay content, 0.80; sand content, 0.76; and soil pH, 0.70. Validation likelihood ratios for diagnostic screening tests were: ECEC <4.0 cmolc kg⁻¹, 10.8; pH <5.5, 5.6; potential N mineralization >4.1 mg kg⁻¹ d⁻¹, 2.9; extractable P <7 mg kg⁻¹, 2.9; exchangeable K <0.2 cmolc kg⁻¹, 2.6. We show the response of prediction accuracy to sample size and demonstrate how the predictive value of spectral libraries can be iteratively increased through detection of spectral outliers among new samples. The spectral library approach opens up new possibilities for modeling, assessment and management of risk in soil evaluations in agricultural, environmental, and engineering applications. Further research should test the use of soil reflectance in pedotransfer functions for prediction of soil functional attributes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural engineering 3aair drying 3acalcium 3acation exchange capacity 3aclay fraction 3aenvironmental engineering 3aexchangeable calcium 3aexchangeable magnesium 3aexchangeable potassium 3aland management 3amagnesium 3amineralization 3anitrogen 3apedotransfer functions 3aphosphorus 3aprediction 3areflectance 3areflectance spectroscopy 3arisk management 3asand fraction 3ascreening 3asoil fertility 3asoil pH 3aspectrometers 3atopsoil 3aSouthern Africa1 aWalsh, Markus G.0 tSoil Science Society of America journal.g2002 May, v. 66, no. 3 p.988-998dSoil Science SocietywJournal:jnl44580x0361-59957nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2136/sssaj2002.98803Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03367naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002500148245011300173300001600286520195000302592002802252650001302280650001302293650001602306650001902322650002102341650001502362650001102377650001702388650001802405650000902423650001302432650001402445650002002459650001302479653002002492653001202512653001702524653002102541653001702562653001702579700001702596700002502613700001902638773012502657856008202782852000902864655001202873IND60628885120221122041023.0190131e20180601xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062888512DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcis.2018.02.0662doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChattopadhyay, Ankur10aElectro-elastoviscous response of polyaniline functionalized nano-porous zeolite based colloidal dispersions  ap. 242-254.  aThe present article discusses the typical influence of grafted conducting polymers in the mesoscale pores of dielectric particles on the static and dynamic electrorheology and electro-viscoelastic behavior of corresponding colloids. Nanocrystalline meso-nanoporous zeolite has been prepared by chemical synthesis and subsequently polyaniline (PANI) coating has been implemented. Electrorheological (ER) suspensions have been formed by dispersing the nanoparticles in silicone oil and their viscoelastic behaviors are examined to understand the nature of such complex colloidal systems under electric fields. PANI-Zeolite ER fluids demonstrate higher static electroviscous effects and yield stress potential than untreated Zeolite, typically studied in literature. Transient electro-viscous characterizations show a stable and negligible hysteresis behavior when both the fluids are exposed to constant as well as time varying electric field intensities. Further oscillatory shear experiments of frequency and strain sweeps exhibit predominant elastic behavior in case of Zeolite based ER suspensions as compared to PANI systems. Detailed investigations reveal Zeolite based ER suspensions display enhanced relative yielding as well as electro-viscoelastic stability than the PANI-Zeolite. The steady state viscous behaviors are scaled against the non-dimensional Mason number to model the system behavior for both fluids. Experimental data of flow behaviors of both the ER fluids are compared with semi-classical models and it is found that the CCJ model possesses a closer proximity than traditional Bingham model, thereby revealing the fluids to be generic pseudo-linear fluids. The present article reveals that while the PANI based fluids are typically hailed superior in literature, it is only restricted to steady shear utilities. In case of dynamic and oscillatory systems, the traditional Zeolite based fluids exhibit superior ER caliber.  aPublisher supplied data 3acoatings 3acolloids 3adispersions 3aelectric field 3aelectroviscosity 3ahysteresis 3amodels 3ananocrystals 3ananoparticles 3aoils 3asilicone 3asynthesis 3aviscoelasticity 3azeolites 0aViscoelasticity 0aZeolite 0aPANI-Zeolite 0aElectro-rheology 0aYield stress 0aSmart fluids1 aRani, Poonam1 aSrivastava, Rajendra1 aDhar, Purbarun0 tJournal of colloid and interface science.g2018 June 01, v. 519 p.242-254dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12461x0021-97977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcis.2018.02.0663Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02581naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001600144245012500160300002000285520124800305592002801553650002301581650001901604650001701623650002001640650001301660650001901673650001501692650001301707653001901720653003101739653002501770653002801795653002001823700001901843700001601862700001801878700001701896700001901913773012601932856008002058852000902138655001202147IND60548684620221119180946.0160905e20160824xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054868462DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.6b072722doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPark, Minju10aTailoring Graphene Nanosheets for Highly Improved Dispersion Stability and Quantitative Assessment in Nonaqueous Solvent  ap. 21595-21602.  aAggregation is a critical limitation for the practical application of graphene-based materials. Herein, we report that graphene oxide (GO) nanosheets chemically modified with ethanolamine (EA), ethylene glycol (EG), and sulfanilic acid (SA) demonstrate superior dispersion stability in organic solvents, specifically EG, based on the differences in their covalent chemistries. Functionalized GO was successfully dispersed in EG at a concentration of 9.0 mg mL–¹ (0.50 vol %), the highest dispersion concentration reported to date. Moreover, our study introduces a unique analytical method for the assessment of dispersion stability and successfully quantifies the instability index based on transmission profiles under centrifugation cycles. Interestingly, GO-EG and GO-EA exhibited highly improved dispersion stabilities approximately 96 and 48 times greater than that of GO in EG solvent, respectively. This finding highlights the critical role of surface functional groups in the enhancement of chemical affinity and miscibility in the surrounding media. We anticipate that the novel structural designs and unique tools presented in this study will further the understanding and application of chemically functionalized carbon materials.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanalytical methods 3acentrifugation 3aethanolamine 3aethylene glycol 3agraphene 3agraphene oxide 3ananosheets 3asolvents 0agraphene oxide 0acovalent functionalization 0adispersion stability 0aquantitative assessment 0aethylene glycol1 aSong, Kyonghwa1 aLee, Taemin1 aCha, JinHyeok1 aLyo, InWoong1 aKim, Byeong-Su0 tACS Applied Materials & Interfaces.g2016 Aug. 24, v. 8, no. 33 p.21595-21602dAmerican Chemical Societyx1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facsami.6b072723Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03171naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245011300166300001800279520173000297592002802027650002102055650001902076650001402095650001002109650002902119650001902148650001202167650001502179650001702194650000902211650001102220650001102231650001602242650000902258653001602267653002402283653002202307653002202329653002102351700001402372700001602386700001602402700001802418700001302436773012402449856008302573852000902656655001202665IND60750813720221120044644.0220214e202202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075081372DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcis.2021.09.0562doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTao, Shengnan10aAll-natural oil-in-water high internal phase Pickering emulsions featuring interfacial bilayer stabilization  ap. 1491-1499.  aSynergistic stabilization of high internal phase Pickering emulsions (HIPPEs) by food-grade colloidal particles are necessary for food, pharmaceuticals or cosmetics owing to their biocompatibility and multi-functionality. By tuning the interfacial structure of adsorbed binary particles, the HIPPE may exhibit extraordinary characteristics compared to conventional all-natural HIPPEs solely stabilized by single-component particle or composite particle, which should have potential applications in varies fields. HIPPEs were prepared by using zein protein nanoparticles (ZNPs) and starch nanocrystals (SNCs) as stabilizers. We systematically investigated the effect of particle concentration and internal phase fraction on HIPPEs morphology, stability and rheological behaviors. Further, the stabilization mechanism as well as potential applications were demonstrated. HIPPEs were prepared with excellent stability against centrifugation and high temperature (50 °C). Our result indicates the successful construction of unique bilayer interfacial structures consisting of inner ZNPs layer and outer SNCs layer. Since SNCs could gelatinize at 50 °C, dense shells can form around droplets afterwards. Such thermally responsive interfacial structures can be used to protect hydrophobic bioactive substances at higher temperatures while still allowing controlled release at certain conditions. Furthermore, with high internal phase fraction, HIPPEs can possibly replace mayonnaise and salad dressing on the market due to comparable appearance and properties. Following the removal of inner oil, porous materials can be further fabricated, which have potential applications in environmental protection or tissue engineering.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiocompatibility 3acentrifugation 3acosmetics 3adrugs 3aenvironmental protection 3ahydrophobicity 3amarkets 3amayonnaise 3ananocrystals 3aoils 3asalads 3astarch 3atemperature 3azein 0aAll-natural 0aHigh internal phase 0aBilayer interface 0aThermal stability 0aPorous materials1 aGuan, Xin1 aLi, Yunxing1 aJiang, Hang1 aGong, Suijing1 aNgai, To0 tJournal of colloid and interface science.g2022 Feb., v. 607 p.1491-1499dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12461x0021-97977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcis.2021.09.0563Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02511naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002100146245005500167300001600222520117000238592002801408650000901436650002301445650001301468650001301481650002101494650002001515650002101535650002001556650001701576650002301593650001601616650001001632651001201642653002001654653001901674653002501693653002401718653001001742653001101752700001601763700001701779700001501796773012701811856008201938852000902020655001202029IND60478501020221123001149.0160121e20100601xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6047850102DNAL7 a10.1556/AAgr.58.2010.2.52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVágújfalvi, A.12aA simplified method to test cereal frost tolerance  ap. 143-149.  aTesting cereal frost tolerance goes back for decades in the Agricultural Research Institute, Martonvásár, Hungary. The climatic programmes used in the plant growth chamber have proved to be fairly efficient, but these methods are time-consuming and have become quite expensive in recent years. An attempt was made to shorten this process by reducing the cold hardening phase, and the freezing test has been simplified and shortened by measuring the relative conductance of leaf segments frozen in a liquid freezer. Frost-tolerant and sensitive wheat lines were tested, and the sensitivity of the system was checked by testing single chromosome substitution lines. Differences were found for all lines frozen at different temperatures. To reduce the costs of the experiment it was attempted to cold-harden the plants not only in a growth chamber but also in a cold room under very low light intensity and it was found that even under thess unfavourable conditions the plants developed a certain level of frost tolerance. The simplified frost tolerance test has proved to be effective, but requires further improvement due to the unsatisfactory significance levels.  aPublisher supplied data 3acold 3acost effectiveness 3afreezers 3afreezing 3afrost resistance 3agrowth chambers 3aleaf conductance 3alight intensity 3aplant growth 3asubstitution lines 3atemperature 3awheat 3aHungary 0afrost tolerance 0acold hardening 0arelative conductance 0aelectrolyte leakage 0awheat 0acereal1 aNagy, V.

This study assesses lead (Pb) and cadmium (Cd) concentrations in the anuran species found in this water reservoir as well as differences between compounds, species and sites of collection. METHODS: Adult anuran amphibians were collected on the north and south shores of the Embalse La Florida and Pb and Cd concentrations were measured in whole body homogenates digested using wet ashing techniques. RESULTS: All individuals of the six species assayed had detectable levels of Pb and Cd that ranged from 1.19 to 5.57 μg/g dry mass and from 1.09 to 6.86 μg/g dry mass, respectively. Anuran amphibians collected in the more contaminated south shore accumulated 21% more Cd and 40% more Pb than individuals from the less altered north shore. Cd and Pb accumulation was not significantly correlated with the concentration in water at the site of collection. CONCLUSIONS: Amphibians of the Embalse La Florida accumulate Cd and Pb. Between and within species, differences were detected in Cd and Pb concentrations. Differences in metal concentrations between species, metals, and individuals collected on shores of the Embalse La Florida with different contamination, were detected. Therefore, it is crucial to implement adequate policies to protect amphibians from the accelerated urban development experienced in this location.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAnura 3aadults 3aarid zones 3aashing 3acadmium 3alakes 3alead 3apollution 3aresearch 3asurface water 3aurban development 3awater reservoirs 3aArgentina1 aAntón, Rosa I.1 aCaviedes-Vidal, Enrique0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research international.g2012 Aug., v. 19, no. 7 p.2889-2897dSpringer-Verlagx0944-13447nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-012-0795-2  aDNAL 7aarticle03618naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003100111040001800142100001600160245020100176300001800377520181800395592002802213650003202241650002702273650002802300650001102328650001602339650000902355650002002364650002302384650001802407650003002425650002002455650001302475650006302488650006502551650001202616650005202628650003602680650001302716650001102729650005802740650000902798700001402807700001602821700001702837700001202854700001502866773010502881856008102986852000903067655001203076IND4477021220221122045856.0120502e201111  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447702122DNAL7 a220102402pmid7 a10.3382/ps.2011-014582doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZeng, P.

The study also investigated the correlation between the abundance of AA transporter mRNA and the AA content of fertilized eggs. Intestinal samples were collected on embryonic d 9, 12, 14, 17, and 19 and the day of hatch. The results showed that, before incubation, the AA content of WRRC eggs was lower (P < 0.05) than the AA content of WYFC eggs. In WYFC, the mRNA abundance of CAT-1 [solute carrier (SLC) family 7 member 1], CAT-4 (SLC family 7 member 4), rBAT (SLC family 3 member 1), y+LAT-1 (SLC family 7 member 7), y+LAT-2 (SLC family 7 member 6), LAT-4 (SLC family 43 member 2), and SNAT-2 (SLC family 38 member 2), as detected by real-time reverse transcriptase PCR, was greater (P < 0.05) than the mRNA abundance detected in the WRRC samples. The mRNA abundance of all measured AA transporters was affected (P < 0.05) by embryonic age. Sex had the largest effect (P < 0.05) on the mRNA expression of CAT-1, CAT-4, y+LAT-2, and LAT-4 in WYFC and on CAT-4 and B0AT-1 (SLC family 6 member 19) mRNA expression in WRRC. In WYFC, only CAT-1 mRNA expression was negatively correlated (r = –0.68 to –0.84, P < 0.05) with all AA content. However, few correlations were detected between AA content and the mRNA expression of multiple transporters in WRRC. These findings provide a comprehensive profile of the temporal and spatial mRNA expression of AA transporters in the small intestine of chick embryos.

These tests were used to generate two third-order polynomial models for estimation of CU and DU, which were then validated based on a cross-validation approach. The generated models had their accuracy quantified by means of the following statistical measures: determination coefficient (R2), reliability and performance index (c), root mean square error (RMSE), and Nash-Sutcliffe coefficient (CNS). Wind direction had no significant influence on CU and DU. The CU values estimated from the cross-validation method were compared to those observed, resulting in R2 = 0.44, c = 0.53, RMSE = 1.82%, and CNS = 0.43. Likewise, DU values estimated from the cross-validation method were compared to the observed values, culminating in R2, c, RMSE, and CNS equal to 0.41%, 0.51%, 2.81% and 0.40%, respectively. The models developed in this study can be useful as a support tool for decision making when applying mechanical lateral-move irrigation systems, allowing estimation of CU and DU values with satisfactory precision for wind speeds less than 5.5 m s-1.  aPublisher supplied data  cConselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológicoa479792/20135 3acrop production 3adecision making 3airrigation systems 3amathematical models 3awind direction 3awind speed 3aBrazil1 aFaria, Lessandro Coll1 aRettore Neto, Osvaldo1 aBeskow, Samuel1 aColombo, Alberto1 aTimm, Luís Carlos,1 aManke, Emanuele Baifus0 tApplied engineering in agriculture.g2017, v. 33, no. 4 p.543-549dAmerican Society of Agricultural and Biological Engineers (ASABE)wJournal:2058x0883-85427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.13031/aea.122443Available from publisher's site40uhttp://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/5860540  aDNAL 7aarticle03474naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001800146245008000164300001600244520194900260592002802209650002302237650002302260650002402283650001002307650002002317650001202337650001302349650002402362650003002386650002802416650001302444650001002457650001502467650001102482650001402493650001102507653002402518653002402542653000902566653001902575653001802594653002102612653003002633653003002663653002102693653001402714700001802728773009502746856008202841852000902923655001202932IND60479388320221122192415.0160121e20010101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6047938832DNAL7 a10.1556/ComEc.1.2000.2.42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDuBowy, P. J.10aMorphological correlates of community structure in North American waterfowl  ap. 147-156.  aI consider relationships between functional feeding morphology and feeding ecology within a guild of dabbling ducks (Anas spp.) which co-occur year round. This waterfowl guild contains three .core. species with typical bill morphologies and four .peripheral. species which vary from the typical morphology in bill length and width or interlamellar spacing. Nearest neighbors in morphological space tend to have high ecological (dietary) overlap; i.e., similarity in morphology corresponds to similarity in ecology. Moreover, by employing Monte Carlo techniques, correlations between morphology and ecology are shown to be weaker during winter than summer, implying that species overcompensate. during winter and reduce dietary overlap even more than would be expected by similarities in bill morphology alone. Additionally, I examine morphological variation among populations of North American mallards (A. platyrhynchos) to test Roughgarden.s (1974) predictions regarding relationships between intraspecific morphological variation and interspecific competition. Specifically, morphological variation should decrease with either an increase in number of competing species or a decrease in available resources. Although populations show expected trends in bill morphology with sex (males have larger bills than females) and latitude (Bergmann.s rule), I am able to demonstrate only a weak trend in females in relationship between morphological variation and intensity of interspecific competition. Examinations of relationships between morphology and ecology should be considered during that time of year when ecological .' crunches' occur, as this should be when selection for different morphologies and feeding strategies occurs, although species may utilize other mechanisms (e.g., foraging behavior, habitat selection) which could mediate resource partitioning to a greater degree than would be expected solely by morphological differences.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAnas platyrhynchos 3aMonte Carlo method 3acommunity structure 3aducks 3afeeding methods 3afemales 3aforaging 3ahabitat preferences 3ainterspecific competition 3ainterspecific variation 3alatitude 3amales 3aprediction 3asummer 3awaterfowl 3awinter 0aCommunity structure 0aCommunity structure 0aAnas 0aDabbling ducks 0aEcomorphology 0aForaging ecology 0aInterspecific competition 0aIntrapopulation variation 0aSeasonal effects 0aWaterfowl1 aDuBowy, P.

Because of high free fatty acid (FFA) level (15.8%), the oil was processed through the two-step process including esterification of FFA and methanolysis of the esterified oil catalyzed by H2SO4 and CaO, respectively. Esterification was optimized by response surface methodology combined with a central composite design. The second-order polynomial equation predicted the lowest acid value of 0.53mgKOH/g under the following optimal reaction conditions: the methanol:oil molar ratio of 8.5:1, the catalyst amount of 2% and the reaction temperature of 45°C. The predicted acid value agreed with the experimental acid value (0.47mgKOH/g). The kinetics of FFA esterification was described by the irreversible pseudo first-order reaction rate law. The apparent kinetic constant was correlated with the initial methanol and catalyst concentrations and reaction temperature. The activation energy of the esterification reaction slightly decreased from 13.23 to 11.55kJ/mol with increasing the catalyst concentration from 0.049 to 0.172mol/dm³. In the second step, the esterified oil reacted with methanol (methanol:oil molar ratio of 9:1) in the presence of CaO (5% to the oil mass) at 60°C. The properties of the obtained biodiesel were within the EN 14214 standard limits. Hence, waste plum stones might be valuable raw material for obtaining fatty oil for the use as alternative feedstock in biodiesel production.  aPublisher supplied data 3atemperature 3awastes 3amethanol 3acalcium oxide 3aequations 3afree fatty acids 3afuel production 3amethanolysis 3acatalysts 3aactivation energy 3aplums 3aesterification 3aacid value 3aoils 3aresponse surface methodology 3asulfuric acid 3abiodiesel 3afeedstocks 3awaste management 0aBiodiesel 0araw materials 0aEsterification 0aMethanolysis 0aOptimization 0aPlum kernel oil 0aKinetics1 aVeličković, Ana V.1 aJoković, Nataša M.1 aStamenković, Olivera S.1 aVeljković, Vlada B.0 tWaste management.g2016 Feb., v. 48 p.619-629dElsevier LtdwJournal:6325x0956-053X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2015.11.0523Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03661naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245015400165300001600319520196300335592002802298650000802326650001302334650002402347650001102371650001402382650002302396650002202419650002202441650001902463650002402482650001502506650001402521650000902535650001402544650002502558650001602583653002102599653001502620653001702635653001502652653002602667700001702693700005702710700001802767700001702785700001602802700005602818700001902874773012202893856008303015852000903098655001203107IND60750813920221120044619.0220214e202202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075081392DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcis.2021.09.0582doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Xiaoyu10aPhoto-thermo catalytic selective oxidation of cyclohexane by In-situ prepared nonstoichiometric Molybdenum oxide and Silver-palladium alloy composite  ap. 954-966.  aThe highly selective oxidation of cyclohexane to cyclohexanone and cyclohexanol (KA oil) is one of the most challenging issues in the chemical industry. However, the difficulty in attaining high selectivity and high conversion rate in parallel for the existing catalysts limits its practical application. In this paper, a novel photo-thermo synergistic catalyst was reported for the aerobic oxidation of cyclohexane. The uniform blue MoO₃₋ₓ nanowires with small diameter stabilized by polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP) were synthesized by a hydrothermal method, and a series of MoO₃₋ₓ-AgPd composite materials of different proportions were prepared by an in-situ reduction process. The morphology, crystalline structure, surface chemical bonding, photoelectrochemical properties of MoO₃₋ₓ-AgPd composites are thoroughly characterized. The MoO₃₋ₓ-AgPd composites present significantly increased catalytic performance than MoO₃₋ₓ nanowires in the photo-thermo synergistic catalytic oxidation of cyclohexane under dry air. The high conversion rate of 11.3% with the KA oil selectivity of 99.0% was achieved by the MoO₃₋ₓ-Ag₂₀Pd₂₀ composites under photo-thermo catalytic process at 120 ℃, which is 1.5 times of that by MoO₃₋ₓ nanowires. Under photo-thermo catalytic process, a high cyclohexane conversion rate similar to that of higher temperature thermal catalysis can be obtained at lower reaction temperature, and more cyclohexanol can be produced with a ketone to alcohol (K/A) ratio of 0.254. The significantly enhanced catalytic activity can be attributed to the effective charge transfer in the AgPd alloy nanoparticles, the optimized band gap structure, the suppressed charge recombination, and the promoted photo-thermo synergetic catalytic effect. This work provides a new reference scheme for the design and preparation of high-efficiency photo-thermo catalysts for the selective oxidation of cyclohexane.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3aalcohols 3aalloy nanoparticles 3aalloys 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3achemical industry 3acrystal structure 3acyclohexanones 3ahot water treatment 3amolybdenum 3ananowires 3aoils 3aoxidation 3apolyvinylpyrrolidone 3atemperature 0aMoO3-x nanowires 0aAgPd alloy 0aPhoto-thermo 0aSynergetic 0aCyclohexane oxidation1 aFeng, Xuyang1 aLiu, Jincheng1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4903-68001 aHuang, Zhilin1 aZong, Shuang1 aLiu, Linlin1 aLiu, Jiarong1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4903-68001 aFang, Yanxiong0 tJournal of colloid and interface science.g2022 Feb., v. 607 p.954-966dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12461x0021-97977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcis.2021.09.0583Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02529naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001400145245012900159300001600288500001500304520116800319592002801487650001401515650001701529650002301546650003001569650002201599650002901621650001201650650001501662650001401677650001001691650002401701650002301725650001201748650002101760650002101781653002201802700001601824700001701840700001701857700001601874773011201890856004802002852000902050655001202059IND4482948120221121025615.0121003e201203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND448294812DNAL7 a10.1134/S00036838120201472doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, L.10aConstruction of the industrial ethanol-producing strain of Saccharomyces cerevisiae able to ferment cellobiose and melibiose  ap. 216-221.  a2019-12-05  aThe gene mel1, encoding Î±-galactosidase in Schizosaccharomyces pombe, and the gene bgl2, encoding and Î±-glucosidase in Trichoderma reesei, were isolated and co-expressed in the industrial ethanolproducing strain of Saccharomyces cerevisiae.

The fiber (∼2 μm diameter) primarily consists of poly(methyl methacrylate) dispersed with clusters of OIP quantum dots. The OIP clusters are radially distributed, normal to the fiber axis. The photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) is high (∼80%) and comparable to that of conventional QDs. The emission maxima are tunable by varying the concentration of OIP precursor in the electrospinning solution. Submicron emission maps show an isotropic and continuous emission along the fiber, suggesting uniform distribution of QD clusters. Temperature-dependent PL response indicates features which are a function of the particle size. For small QDs, the PLQY(T) maxima are close to the ambient temperature, whereas the PLQY(T) maxima shift sizably to T < 50 K for larger QDs. Significant waveguiding of QDs emission and amplified spontaneous emission, a prerequisite for lasing, were observed in the fiber confined OIP system at room temperature.  aPublisher supplied data 3aambient temperature 3aisotropy 3aparticle size 3aphotoluminescence 3apolymethylmethacrylate 3aquantum dots 0aorganic−inorganic hybrid perovskite 0aquantum dots 0aelectrospinning 0aphotoluminescence 0aquantum confinement 0awaveguiding 0aamplified spontaneous emission (ASE)1 aGanesh, N.1 aNarayan, K.

Since these measures have the common objective of summarizing community structure, they may be expected to be intercorrelated. In this paper, seven standard measures of evenness were calculated for 65 sample plots of ruderal vegetation within the archaeological sites of Paestum and Venosa (southern Italy). Principal component analysis was used to identify the primary aspects of community structure being characterized by these seven indices. The first two principal components explained 96% of total variance. A comparison of the first two principal components with the analyzed measures of evenness provides insight into what aspects of community structure they are expressing. While the first principal component is most sensitive to the relative abundances of rare species, the second principal component is clearly associated to changes in the abundance of the dominant community species.  aPublisher supplied data 3acommunity structure 3aprincipal component analysis 3arare species 3avariance 3avegetation 3aItaly 0acorrelation 0acorrelation 0aEvenness 0aLorenz ordering 0aPrincipal component analysis1 aDe Zuliani, E.1 aPacini, A.1 aet al., 0 tCommunity ecology.g2001 June 1, v. 2, no. 1 p.51-56dAkadémiai Kiadóx1585-85537nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1556%2FComEc.2.2001.1.63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02498naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001100147245006000158300001200218520148700230592002801717650000901745650001601754650001101770650001101781650001301792650001401805650001301819650001401832650001501846700001701861700001601878700001701894773013501911856008102046852000902127655001202136IND60601076120221119191606.0180705e201807  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060107612DNAL7 a10.1007/s12665-018-7694-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLe, L.10aSpatial variation of selenium in Appalachian coal seams  ap. 511.  aSelenium (Se) is a trace element that can cause human physical deformations due to selenosis, and mutagenic changes on a range of sensitive macro-organisms. Previous studies indicated that Se enrichment is significantly greater in coal than in other rock units, suggesting a correlation between Se and coal bed proximity. Since coal extraction can cause a release of Se, some regulatory authorities have responded by requiring sampling of coal seams and adjacent rock for Se prior to issuing coal mining permits. This sampling is done under the assumption that Se in a small number of samples will be correlated to the Se concentrations throughout the strata they represent. For example, in one case a single continuous deep rock core was sampled for Se to estimate the concentrations of Se across a 2.52 km² proposed surface coal mine. This project examined the adequacy of such an approach using univariate statistics and variograms to determine the spatial variability and correlation of Se concentrations collected from six Appalachian coal seams. The results from all analyses showed no significant spatial correlation of Se within any coal seam examined. Given this lack of measured Se spatial correlation in Appalachian coal seams for scales as small as 0.10 km, it is unlikely that a Se spatial correlation exists in adjacent rock units at similar scales either, which is currently the assumption being made for sampling to minimize Se pollution from surface coal mining.  aPublisher supplied data 3acoal 3adeformation 3ahumans 3amining 3amutagens 3apollution 3aselenium 3aselenosis 3astatistics1 aTyner, J.

Some physicochemical properties (moisture content, water activity, and color parameters) and phytochemical characteristics (total phenolic compounds and total antioxidant activity) were assessed in fresh and dried samples. Four kinetic models were tested aiming for convenient modeling of the convective drying curves. The Page and Approximation of diffusion models were adequate in data fitting, which was assessed by the magnitude of the adjusted coefficient of determination (Radj2) and reduced χ². The moisture content and water activity of peel dried with the three processes were within acceptable levels for safe storage of products. All processes affected peel color. However, the browning index of freeze‐dried samples was equivalent to fresh ones, being higher when convective and microwave drying were applied. Higher chroma parameters were obtained in dried samples indicating a more intense color than fresh peel. Freeze‐drying enhanced total phenolic compounds and total antioxidant activity of orange peel when compared to convective and microwave drying. Therefore, from a quality point of view this process seems to be the most appropriate to produce dried orange peel. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: Dried orange peel transformed in flour, or slices, cubes, or different geometrical features, may be suitable for incorporation as an ingredient in many types of foods such as cakes, biscuits, or bread, enriching their content in phenolic compounds and total antioxidant activity, therefore creating a value‐added product. Within the drying conditions used in this study, it was found that the freeze‐drying process is preferable when a lighter and more yellow dried orange peel is desired, with improved phytochemical characteristics. On the other hand, when a darker product with color similar to the fresh peel needs to be attained, the microwave drying process should be chosen.  aPublisher supplied data  aUID/Multi/50016/2019cNational Funds from FCT ‐ Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia 3aantioxidant activity 3abreads 3acolor 3aflour 3afreeze drying 3aingredients 3aorange peels 3aphytochemicals 3avalue-added products 3awater activity 3awater content1 aRamos, Inês N.1 aBrandão, Teresa R.

Rhomboids typically contain six or seven transmembrane domains (TMD) and have been classified into four subgroups: Secretase A and B, Presenilin-Associated-Rhomboid-Like (PARL) and iRhoms. Although the iRhoms, iRhom1 and iRhom2, have lost their protease activity during evolution, they retain key non-protease functions and have been implicated in the regulation of epidermal growth factor (EGF) signalling. EGF is moreover a substrate of RHBDL2, their active Rhomboid relative. Other substrates of RHBDL2 include members of the EphrinB family and thrombomodulin. RHBDL2 has also previously been demonstrated to be important in wound healing in cutaneous keratinocytes through the cleavage of thrombomodulin. Additional roles for these intriguing proteins seem likely to be revealed in the future. This review focuses on our current understanding of Rhomboids and, in particular, on RHBDL2 and iRhom2 and their roles in cellular processes and human disease.  aPublisher supplied data 3aepidermal growth factor 3aevolution 3ahuman diseases 3akeratinocytes 3aproteins 3aserine proteinases 3atissue repair 2aAmyloid Precursor Protein Secretasesxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aAnimals 2aCarrier Proteinsxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aCell Growth Processesxphysiology 2aHumans 2aKeratinocytesxcytologyxmetabolism. 2aNeoplasmsxmetabolismxpathology. 2aSerine Proteasesxchemistryxmetabolism.1 aBrooke, Matthew A.1 aKelsell, David P.1 aBlaydon, Diana C.0 tCell and tissue research.g2013 Feb., v. 351, no. 2 p.301-307dSpringer-Verlagx0302-766X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00441-012-1542-1  aDNAL 7aarticle02466naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002200152245010900174300001600283520115000299592002801449650002101477650001501498650001901513650002601532650001301558650001801571650001901589650001901608650001201627650001901639653001201658653001101670653002101681653002701702653001901729653002701748700002501775700001801800773011801818856008701936852000902023655001202032IND50066057120221122050038.0190318e201308  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006605712DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jfoodeng.2013.02.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCastro, Alejandra10aEffect of heat treatment and homogenization on the rheological properties of aqueous parsnip suspensions  ap. 383-392.  aParsnip (Pastinaca sativa) suspensions, at concentrations corresponding to a dilute and concentrated regime, were subjected to pasteurization, and heat treatments that favored β-elimination reactions and pectin methyl esterase activity. The different heat treatments were combined with homogenization. Physicochemical properties such as content of insoluble/soluble material and insoluble/soluble pectin were measured together with particle and rheological properties. Pectin methyl esterase activity led to a high yield of insoluble material and insoluble pectin, whereas β-elimination led to a high yield of soluble material and solubilized pectin. Homogenization after heat treatment resulted in increased solubilization of the pectin, especially after β-elimination reactions. Parsnip suspensions subjected to pectin methyl esterase activity exhibited the highest elastic modulus most likely due to the cross-linked pectin conferring rigidity to the cell walls. The content of insoluble material and the particle properties such as size and rigidity are important factor for the rheological properties of concentrated parsnip suspensions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPastinaca sativa 3acell walls 3ahomogenization 3amodulus of elasticity 3aparsnips 3aparticle size 3apasteurization 3apectinesterase 3apectins 3asolubilization 0aParsnip 0aPectin 0aBeta-elimination 0aPectin methyl esterase 0aHomogenization 0aRheological properties1 aBergenståhl, Björn1 aTornberg, Eva0 tJournal of food engineering.g2013 Aug., v. 117, no. 3 p.383-392dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl34294x0260-87747nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jfoodeng.2013.02.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03473naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100001800166245014300184300001600327520159400343592002801937650001801965650002901983650002202012650001302034650001802047650000902065650001802074650001502092650001302107650001702120650002402137650001402161650001302175650001402188650001202202650002302214650003902237650003702276650003902313650001102352650002402363650002802387650003002415650002302445650002502468650003102493650001902524650003102543650005302574700002102627700001402648700002102662700001902683773008802702856004802790852000902838655001202847IND50067768020221116142216.0130712e201307  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006776802DNAL7 a236610962pmid7 a10.1007/s10646-013-1080-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNavis, Sabine10aPesticide exposure impacts not only hatching of dormant eggs, but also hatchling survival and performance in the water flea Daphnia magna   ap. 803-814.  aLaboratory ecotoxicity tests and biomonitoring in aquatic systems are currently based on the active component of invertebrate communities. Even though dormant egg banks are crucial for the long term survival and community dynamics of many aquatic organisms, the effects of anthropogenic activities on dormant egg bank dynamics have rarely been studied. In this study we investigated the effects of two pesticides with a different mode of action (carbaryl and fenoxycarb) on hatching of Daphnia magna dormant eggs (ephippia) as well as on survival, growth and reproduction of the hatched neonates. Dormant eggs were exposed to the pesticides simultaneously to incubation under conditions that induce hatching (long daylight and 20 °C). Carbaryl had no negative effects on embryonic development or hatching rate up to concentrations almost 1,000 times the median effect concentration (EC50) of neonate survival in acute tests. Fenoxycarb, however, had a significant dose-related effect by delaying or completely stopping the hatching process and caused severe abnormalities in developing individuals. Both pesticides had significant negative effects on survival and reproduction of the hatchlings. These results indicate that, in addition to inducing mortality of active individuals, pesticides can affect zooplankton communities by altering hatching dynamics and life history traits of hatched individuals. We briefly discuss how such pollution induced changes in the benthic-pelagic coupling could translate into trans-generational effects impacting ecological and evolutionary dynamics.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDaphnia magna 3aanthropogenic activities 3aaquatic organisms 3acarbaryl 3aecotoxicology 3aeggs 3aembryogenesis 3afenoxycarb 3ahatching 3alife history 3amechanism of action 3amortality 3aneonates 3apollution 2aAnimals 2aCarbarylxtoxicity 2aDaphniaxdrug effectsxphysiology. 2aDose-Response Relationship, Drug 2aEmbryo, Nonmammalianxdrug effects 2aFemale 2aLarvaxdrug effects 2aLongevityxdrug effects 2aOvipositionxdrug effects 2aOvumxdrug effects 2aPesticidesxtoxicity 2aPhenylcarbamatesxtoxicity 2aToxicity Tests 2aWater Pollutantsxtoxicity 2aZooplanktonxdrug effectsxgrowth & development.1 aWaterkeyn, Aline1 aVoet, Tom1 aMeester, Luc de,1 aBrendonck, Luc0 tEcotoxicology.g2013 July, v. 22, no. 5 p.803-814dSpringer-Verlagx0963-92927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10646-013-1080-y  aDNAL 7aarticle02949naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100001700142245004700159500002000206520093100226592002801157596008101185596008101266596006601347596006601413596005301479596005301532596005301585596005101638596005801689596008901747596008701836650001201923650002201935650001501957650001101972650001301983651002101996700005902017700006302076700006602139700005102205773013702256856007702393852000902470655001202479IND60789751720221118034917.0220822e202010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078975172DNAL7 a10.1029/2019JC0160422doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Tianyu10aEddy‐Induced Acceleration of Argo Floats  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aFloat trajectories are simulated using Lagrangian particle tracking software and eddy‐permitting ocean model output from the Estimating the Circulation and Climate of the Ocean, Phase II (ECCO2) project. We find that Argo‐like particles near strong mean flows tend to accelerate while at their parking depth. This effect is pronounced in western boundary current regions and in the Antarctic Circumpolar Current system. The acceleration is associated with eddy‐mean flow interactions: Eddies converge particles toward regions with stronger mean currents. Particles do not accelerate when they are advected by the eddy or mean flow alone. During a 9‐day parking period, speed increases induced by the eddy‐mean flow interactions can be as large as 2 cm s⁻¹, representing roughly 10% of the mean velocity. If unaccounted for, this acceleration could bias velocities inferred from observed Argo float trajectories.  aPublisher supplied data  aNA14OAR4310219cDOC | National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)  aNA15OAR4320071cDOC | National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)  a41525019cNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)  a41830538cNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)  aOCE‐1234473cNational Science Foundation (NSF)  aPLR‐1425989cNational Science Foundation (NSF)  aOPP‐1936222cNational Science Foundation (NSF)  aXDA15020901cChinese Academy of Sciences (CAS)  a133244KYSB20190031cChinese Academy of Sciences (CAS)  aGML2019ZD0303cSouthern Marine Science and Engineering Guangdong Laboratory (SMSEGL)  a2019BT2H594cSouthern Marine Science and Engineering Guangdong Laboratory (SMSEGL) 3aclimate 3acomputer software 3ageophysics 3amodels 3aresearch 3aAntarctic region1 aGille, Sarah T.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9144-43681 aMazloff, Matthew R.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1650-58501 aZilberman, Nathalie V.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5855-19941 aDu, Yan1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7842-08010 tJournal of geophysical research.g2020 Oct., v. 125, no. 10 p.e2019JC016042-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:27942x2169-92757nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2019JC0160423Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01823naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024005000094040001800144100001900162245014000181300001600321500001900337500000900356520064100365592002801006650003801034650001301072650001001085650001001095650001601105650000901121650001501130650001001145650001601155650003001171700002001201773012201221856009701343852000901440655001201449IND60663668420221118011152.0191122e195704  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066366842DNAL7 a10.2134/agronj1957.00021962004900040010x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLebsock, K.

The secure operation of power systems sometimes cannot be guaranteed only by regulating traditional generating units, due to the rapid regulation requirement of making up for power shortage. To address this issue, this paper proposes using emergency demand response (DR) to provide contingency reserve capacities by adjusting the power consumption of flexible loads (FLs). Firstly, in order to analyze the dynamic regulation process of power systems in accidental outages, the power system model in faulty condition is reconstructed to obtain the regulation power from well-running generators. On this basis, FLs are modelled and integrated into the novel reconstructed power system model to be as an alternative method of making up for the fast regulation capacities. Considering that the inevitable communication time-delay probably leads to the slowdown of response speed and endangers the system security, an adaptive time-delay control (ATDC) scheme is proposed and integrated into the control process of aggregated FLs. In this manner, the regulation speed of FLs can be accelerated, the control precision of response capacities can be improved, and the power system frequency deviations caused by time-delay can be decreased. Finally, the proposed models and methods are verified by numerical studies. The results in the test system show that the frequency deviations can be decreased effectively from −0.3276 Hz to −0.1337 Hz in accidental outages by using the ATDC scheme of FLs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aenergy use and consumption 3agenerators (equipment) 3amodels 0aPower systems 0aFlexible loads 0aDemand response 0aTime-delay control 0aAccidental outages1 aDing, Yi1 aSong, Yong-Hua,0 tApplied energy.g2020 Oct. 01, v. 275 p.115321-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11876x0306-26197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2020.1153213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02655naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001300152245013400165520144300299592002801742650002601770650001701796650001201813650001901825650001101844650001101855650001501866650000701881650001501888650001501903650002201918650002101940700002001961700002001981700001402001700001802015773012802033856008702161852000902248655001202257IND60771360920221120060802.0220325e20220318xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077136092DNAL7 a10.3390/microorganisms100306482doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYu, Lan 10aHarnessing Paenarthrobacter ureafaciens YL1 and Pseudomonas koreensis YL2 Interactions to Improve Degradation of Sulfamethoxazole  aSulfamethoxazole (SMX) is a widespread and persistent pollutant in the environment. Although the screening and analysis of SMX-degrading bacteria have been documented, the interaction mechanisms of functional microorganisms are still poorly understood. This study constructed a consortium with strain YL1 and YL2 supplied with SMX as the sole carbon and energy source. The coexisting mechanism and the removal of SMX of the consortium were investigated. The total oxidizable carbon (TOC) removal rate of the combined bacterial system was 38.94% compared to 29.45% for the single bacterial system at the same biomass. The mixed bacterial consortium was able to resist SMX at concentrations up to 400 mg/L and maintained a stable microbial structure at different culture conditions. The optimum conditions found for SMX degradation were 30 °C, pH 7.0, a shaking speed of 160 r·min⁻¹, and an initial SMX concentration of 200 mg·L⁻¹. The degradation of SMX was accelerated by the addition of YL2 for its ability to metabolize the key intermediate, 4-aminophenol. The removal rate of 4-aminophenol by strain YL2 reached 19.54% after 5 days. Genome analysis revealed that adding riboflavin and enhancing the reducing capacity might contribute to the degradation of SMX. These results indicated that it is important for the bioremediation of antibiotic-contaminated aquatic systems to understand the metabolism of bacterial communities.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPseudomonas koreensis 3aaminophenols 3abiomass 3abioremediation 3acarbon 3aenergy 3ametabolism 3apH 3apollutants 3ariboflavin 3asequence analysis 3asulfamethoxazole1 aWang, Yingning 1 aShan, Xiaoqing 1 aMa, Fang 1 aGuo, Haijuan 0 tMicroorganisms.g2022 Mar. 18, v. 10, no. 3dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27145x2076-26077nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/microorganisms100306483Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03336naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100006200142245008400204500002000288520163300308592002801941596003001969596007201999596001002071596000902081596003002090650001502120650001302135650002402148650001402172650002302186650000902209651001402218700005702232700006402289700006702353700005702420700006502477700006002542700006502602773013702667856007702804852000902881655001202890IND60789751820221118034944.0220822e202010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078975182DNAL7 a10.1029/2020JC0163252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHermans, Tim H.

Removing explained parts of interannual sea level variability from observations helps to improve estimates of long‐term sea level trends. To this end, the contributions of different drivers to interannual sea level variability need to be understood and quantified. We quantified these contributions for the entire NWES by performing sensitivity experiments with a high‐resolution configuration of the Regional Ocean Modeling System (ROMS). The lateral and atmospheric boundary conditions were derived from reanalyses. We compared our model results with satellite altimetry data and used our sensitivity experiments to show that nonlinear feedbacks cause only minor interannual sea level variability on the shelf. This indicates that our experiments can be used to separate the effects of different drivers. We find that wind dominates the variability of annual mean sea level in the southern and eastern North Sea (up to 4.7‐cm standard deviation), whereas the inverse barometer effect dominates elsewhere on the NWES (up to 1.7‐cm standard deviation). In contrast, forcing at the lateral ocean boundaries results in small and coherent variability on the shelf (0.5‐cm standard deviation). Variability driven by buoyancy fluxes ranges from 0.5‐ to 1.3‐cm standard deviation. The results of our sensitivity experiments explain the (anti)correlation between interannual sea level variability at different locations on the NWES and can be used to estimate sea level rise from observations in this region with higher accuracy.  aPublisher supplied data  cEU's Horizon 2020 RECEIPT  cMet Office Hadley Centre Climate programme funded by BEIS and Defra  cDefra  cBEIS  cEU's Horizon 2020 RECEIPT 3ageophysics 3aresearch 3asatellite altimetry 3asea level 3astandard deviation 3awind 3aNorth Sea1 aLe Bars, Dewi1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1175-42251 aKatsman, Caroline A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7297-03111 aCamargo, Carolina M.

One of the strains studied (IM 230) has an average nucleotide identity (ANI) of 97% to the recently reported genome of the type strain DSM 109 of Rcy. tenuis and is regarded as virtually identical at the species level. The ANI of 80% for three other strains (DSM 110, DSM 111, DSM 112) to the type strain of Rcy. tenuis points to a differentiation of these at the species level. Rcy. purpureus is equidistant from Rcy. tenuis and the new species, based on both ANI (78–80%) and complete proteome comparisons (70% AAI). Strains DSM 110, DSM 111, and DSM 112 are very closely related to each other based on ANI, whole genome, and proteome comparisons but clearly distinct from the Rcy. tenuis type strain DSM 109. In addition to the whole genome differentiation, these three strains also contain unique genetic differences in cytochrome genes and contain genes for an anaerobic cobalamin synthesis pathway that is lacking from both Rcy. tenuis and Rcy. purpureus. Based on genomic and genetic differences, these three strains should be considered to represent a new species, which is distinctly different from both Rcy. purpureus and Rcy. tenuis, for which the new name Rhodocyclus gracilis sp. nov. is proposed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRhodocyclus purpureus 3aRhodocyclus tenuis 3agenomics 3anew species 3anomen novum 3aphotosynthesis 3aproteome 3asequence analysis 3avitamin B121 aAviles, Fabiola A.1 aImhoff, Johannes F.1 aKünzel, Sven 1 aNeulinger, Sven C.1 aMeyer, Terrance E.0 tMicroorganisms.g2022 Mar. 18, v. 10, no. 3dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27145x2076-26077nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/microorganisms100306493Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02770naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002400139245014100163520127800304592002801582650002201610650001101632650001701643650001001660650001101670650001401681650001601695650001801711650002201729700002101751700002501772700002001797700002101817700001901838700002001857700001901877700001801896700001901914700002101933700003101954700002001985700002502005700002302030700001902053773012102072856007402193852000902267655001202276IND60763592620221123010245.0220120e20220108xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076359262DNAL7 a10.3390/v140101112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTaniguchi, Keiichi 10aCharacterization of the In Vitro and In Vivo Efficacy of Baloxavir Marboxil against H5 Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza Virus Infection  aHuman infections caused by the H5 highly pathogenic avian influenza virus (HPAIV) sporadically threaten public health. The susceptibility of HPAIVs to baloxavir acid (BXA), a new class of inhibitors for the influenza virus cap-dependent endonuclease, has been confirmed in vitro, but it has not yet been fully characterized. Here, the efficacy of BXA against HPAIVs, including recent H5N8 variants, was assessed in vitro. The antiviral efficacy of baloxavir marboxil (BXM) in H5N1 virus-infected mice was also investigated. BXA exhibited similar in vitro activities against H5N1, H5N6, and H5N8 variants tested in comparison with seasonal and other zoonotic strains. Compared with oseltamivir phosphate (OSP), BXM monotherapy in mice infected with the H5N1 HPAIV clinical isolate, the A/Hong Kong/483/1997 strain, also caused a significant reduction in viral titers in the lungs, brains, and kidneys, thereby preventing acute lung inflammation and reducing mortality. Furthermore, compared with BXM or OSP monotherapy, combination treatments with BXM and OSP using a 48-h delayed treatment model showed a more potent effect on viral replication in the organs, accompanied by improved survival. In conclusion, BXM has a potent antiviral efficacy against H5 HPAIV infections.  aPublisher supplied data 3aInfluenza A virus 3ahumans 3ainflammation 3alungs 3amodels 3amortality 3aoseltamivir 3apublic health 3avirus replication1 aAndo, Yoshinori 1 aKobayashi, Masanori 1 aToba, Shinsuke 1 aNobori, Haruaki 1 aSanaki, Takao 1 aNoshi, Takeshi 1 aKawai, Makoto 1 aYoshida, Ryu 1 aSato, Akihiko 1 aShishido, Takao 1 aNaitō, Akira,d1932-2012,1 aMatsuno, Keita 1 aOkamatsu, Masatoshi 1 aSakoda, Yoshihiro 1 aKida, Hiroshi 0 tViruses.g2022 Jan. 08, v. 14, no. 1dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27138x1999-49157nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/v140101113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02839naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003800113040001800151100002200169245013800191300001600329520106700345592002801412650001601440650001301456650001201469650001101481650001601492650001501508650001101523650002201534650001401556650001701570650001301587650001701600650000901617650001101626650002101637650001301658650000901671650001201680650002501692650003001717650004301747650003001790700002501820700002401845700001701869700002701886700001901913700002201932700002201954700002001976700002301996700001702019773009602036856008402132852000902216655001202225IND60086609120221120172454.0141101e201101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008660912DNAL7 a208703262pmid7 a10.1016/j.envpol.2010.09.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHolmstrup, Martin10aBody metal concentrations and glycogen reserves in earthworms (Dendrobaena octaedra) from contaminated and uncontaminated forest soil  ap. 190-197.  aStress originating from toxicants such as heavy metals can induce compensatory changes in the energy metabolism of organisms due to increased energy expenses associated with detoxification and excretion processes. These energy expenses may be reflected in the available energy reserves such as glycogen. In a field study the earthworm, Dendrobaena octaedra, was collected from polluted areas, and from unpolluted reference areas. If present in the environment, cadmium, lead and copper accumulated to high concentrations in D. octaedra. In contrast, other toxic metals such as aluminium, nickel and zinc appeared to be regulated and kept at low internal concentrations compared to soil concentrations. Lead, cadmium and copper accumulation did not correlate with glycogen reserves of individual worms. In contrast, aluminium, nickel and zinc were negatively correlated with glycogen reserves. These results suggest that coping with different metals in earthworms is associated with differential energy demands depending on the associated detoxification strategy.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDendrobaena 3aaluminum 3acadmium 3acopper 3acorrelation 3aearthworms 3aenergy 3aenergy metabolism 3aexcretion 3aforest soils 3aglycogen 3aheavy metals 3alead 3anickel 3atoxic substances 3atoxicity 3azinc 2aAnimals 2aGlycogenxmetabolism 2aMetals, Heavyxmetabolism 2aOligochaetaxdrug effectsxmetabolism. 2aSoil Pollutantsxtoxicity1 aSørensen, Jesper G.1 aOvergaard, Johannes1 aBayley, Mark1 aBindesbøl, Anne-Mette1 aSlotsbo, Stine1 aFisker, Karina V.1 aMaraldo, Kristine1 aWaagner, Dorthe1 aLabouriau, Rodrigo1 aAsmund, Gert0 tEnvironmental pollution.g2011 Jan., v. 159, no. 1 p.190-197dElsevier Ltdx0269-74917nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2010.09.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03465naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100003100148245010200179520151900281592002801800650001501828650001001843650002101853650001501874650001801889650001901907650001301926650001901939650001101958650000701969650001001976653001601986653001102002653001102013653002102024700002202045700002402067700005702091700001702148700002002165700001902185700001902204700006002223700006602283700002102349700006602370700005802436700006202494700002102556700002302577700002102600700001802621700002002639773011202659856008302771852000902854655001202863IND60755877620221118131630.0211206e20220201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075587762DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bios.2021.1137282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGonzález Fernández, Eva,10aIn vivo application of an implantable tri-anchored methylene blue-based electrochemical pH sensor  aThe development of robust implantable sensors is important in the successful advancement of personalised medicine as they have the potential to provide in situ real-time data regarding the status of health and disease and the effectiveness of treatment. Tissue pH is a key physiological parameter and herein, we report the design, fabrication, functionalisation, encapsulation and protection of a miniaturised, self-contained, electrochemical pH sensor system and characterisation of sensor performance. Notably for the first time in this environment the pH sensor was based on a methylene blue redox reporter which showed remarkable robustness, accuracy and sensitivity. This was achieved by encapsulation of a self-assembled monolayer containing methylene blue entrapped within a Nafion layer. Another powerful feature was the incorporation, within the same implanted device, of a fabricated on-chip Ag/AgCl reference electrode – vital in any electrochemical sensor, but often ignored. When utilised in vivo, the sensor allowed accurate tracking of externally induced pH changes within a naturally occurring ovine lung cancer model, and correlated well with single point laboratory measurements made on extracted arterial blood, whilst enabling in vivo time-dependent measurements. The sensors functioned robustly whilst implanted, and maintained in vitro function once extracted and together, these results demonstrate proof-of-concept of the ability to sense real-time intratumoral tissue pH changes in vivo.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiosensors 3ablood 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrodes 3aencapsulation 3alung neoplasms 3amedicine 3amethylene blue 3amodels 3apH 3asheep 0aImplantable 0aSensor 0aTumour 0aMicrofabrication1 aStaderini, Matteo1 aMarland, Jamie R.K.1 aGray, Mark E.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2035-14251 aUçar, Ahmet1 aDunare, Camelia1 aBlair, Ewen O.1 aSullivan, Paul1 aTsiamis, Andreas1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0103-94471 aGreenhalgh, Stephen N.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7769-546X1 aGregson, Rachael1 aClutton, Richard Eddie1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1120-77551 aSmith, Stewart1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7004-92191 aTerry, Jonathan G.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4012-93301 aArgyle, David J.1 aWalton, Anthony J.1 aMount, Andrew R.1 aBradley, Mark1 aMurray, Alan F.0 tBiosensors & bioelectronics.g2022 Feb. 01, v. 197 p.113728-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11631x0956-56637nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bios.2021.1137283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02703naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005900148245007300207300001800280520146500298592002801763650002401791650001501815650001601830650002201846650001201868650002201880650001401902650001401916650001401930650002401944650001901968650002201987700003002009700002402039700001802063773013302081856008202214852000902296655001202305IND60744912020221120085734.0210721e202108  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074491202DNAL7 a10.1007/s10530-021-02513-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFleri, Jesse R.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3824-991510aNon-native earthworms alter the assembly of a meadow plant community  ap. 2407-2415.  aNon-native earthworms can alter ecosystems by modifying soil structure, depredating seeds and seedlings, and consuming soil organic matter, yet the initial responses of plant communities to earthworm invasions remain poorly understood. We assessed the effect of non-native earthworms on seedling survival during germination and after establishment using six native and six non-native plant species grown from seed in single- and multi-species experimental mesocosms. We examined the extent to which earthworms (1) influenced seedling survival, (2) selectively depredated native versus non-native plants, (3) impacted establishment based on seed size and/or root morphology, and (4) shaped community assembly. The effect of earthworms on seedling survival varied temporally and among species but inconsistently with respect to species origin. Differences in seed/seedling survival translated to changes in community assembly. Earthworms tended to reduce species abundance, richness, evenness, and diversity in multi-species mesocosms and led to the divergence of communities by treatment. In general, species with large seeds and fibrous roots dominated communities with earthworms present, whereas species with small seeds and taproots only persisted in multi-species mesocosms without earthworms. Our findings suggest that earthworms act as ecological filters in the early stages of invasion to shape community composition based on plant morphological traits.  aPublisher supplied data 3acommunity structure 3aearthworms 3agermination 3aintroduced plants 3ameadows 3aplant communities 3apredation 3aseed size 3aseedlings 3asoil organic matter 3asoil structure 3aspecies abundance1 aMartin, T.

R. Br.] is a staple grain crop in the arid and semiarid regions of Africa and India, and a new grain crop in the USA. A 2-year field experiment was conducted near Mead, NE, in 1995 and 1996 on a Sharpsburg silty clay loam (fine, smectitic, mesic Typic Argiudoll) soil with approximately 29 g kg⁻¹ organic matter, 35 kg ha⁻¹ NO₃–N, and pH of 6.0. The objective was to determine the influence of hybrid and N on grain yield, dry matter accumulation and partitioning, and growth rates throughout the growing season. Nitrogen concentrations, uptake, and use efficiency were also determined. Treatments were a factorial combination of the pearl millet dwarf hybrids (59022A × 89-0083, 1011A × 086R, and 1361M × 6Rm) and N levels (0 and 78 kg ha⁻¹) in a randomized complete block design. Two plants per plot were sampled at 2-wk intervals and partitioned into plant parts, dried, weighed, and analyzed for N concentration. Applied N increased grain yield by 0.4 to 0.5 Mg ha⁻¹, but had only a small effect on dry matter accumulation and partitioning. Hybrid differences were small for grain yield. Pearl millet dry matter accumulation increased cubically in both years, with maximum crop growth rates among hybrids ranging from 0.48 to 0.57 g m⁻² per growing degree day (GDD) in 1995 and ranging from 1.9 to 3.1 g m⁻² GDD⁻¹ maximum in 1996. The relative growth rate among hybrids declined from 0.012 to 0.020 g⁻¹ m⁻² GDD⁻¹ in both years to near zero at physiological maturity. Nitrogen concentrations were higher during the vegetative stages and decreased with plant age. Applied N decreased N use efficiency for aboveground biomass (NUE₁) by 18 to 25 g DM g⁻¹ N, and N use efficiency for grain (NUE₂) by 7 to 12 g grain g⁻¹ N. Environmental variability due to years had a greater effect on yield, growth, and N levels than hybrid and applied N.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArgiudolls 3aCenchrus americanus 3aaboveground biomass 3aagronomy 3adry matter accumulation 3afield experimentation 3agrain yield 3aheat sums 3ahybrids 3anitrogen 3anutrient use efficiency 3aorganic matter 3apH 3aplant age 3asilty clay loam soils 3aAfrica 3aIndia 3aNebraska1 aMason, Stephen C.1 aGalusha, Tom1 aClegg, Max D.0 tAgronomy journal.g1999 Sept., v. 91, no. 5 p.737-743dAmerican Society of AgronomywJournal:jnl44592x0002-19627nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2134/agronj1999.915737x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03024naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002300152245006600175520160700241592002801848650003001876650003201906650002501938650002701963650001301990650001002003650002402013650001002037650001102047650001002058650003002068650005002098650001902148650001002167650001202177650001202189651001102201700002702212700002102239700002102260700002202281700002702303773012802330856008702458852000902545655001202554IND60771361220221120060510.0220325e20220318xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077136122DNAL7 a10.3390/microorganisms100306522doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHalecker, Sabrina 10aVirological Characterization of Pigs with Erythema Multiforme  aErythema multiforme in pigs is an acute, self-limiting disease characterized by red skin areas and often associated with anorexia, fever and respiratory problems. The cause of the disease remains unknown. In a recent study, animals of a commercial breeding herd in Greece were examined, and all animals were found seropositive for porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV). However, neither PRRSV and porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2) viremia nor antibodies against Aujeszky’s disease virus, African swine fever virus and classical swine fever virus were detected. Here, an extended examination of these pigs was performed on a wide range of porcine viruses using highly sensitive polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based methods. Affected skin of five animals revealed the presence of porcine lymphotropic herpesvirus-1 (PLHV-1) in all cases, PLHV-2 in one animal and PLHV-3 in four animals. However, neither porcine cytomegalovirus (PCMV) nor porcine circoviruses (PCV1, PCV2, PCV3 and PCV4) were detected. In blood samples, PLHV-1 was present in two animals and PLHV-2, PCV2 and PCV3 in one individual, with PCMV, PCV1 and PCV4 in none of the animals. In one animal, four viruses were found in the blood (PLHV-1, PLHV-2, PCV2 and PCV3). A PRRSV viremia was also not detected. All animals carried porcine endogenous retrovirus C (PERV-C) in their genome, but recombinant PERV-A/C was not detected. The results suggest that porcine viruses may be involved in erythema multiforme in these animals and that further studies are needed to assess the role of these pathogens in the disease.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAfrican swine fever virus 3aClassical swine fever virus 3aPorcine circovirus-2 3aSuid betaherpesvirus 2 3aanorexia 3ablood 3aerythema multiforme 3afever 3agenome 3aherds 3apolymerase chain reaction 3aporcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome 3aseroprevalence 3aswine 3aviremia 3aviruses 3aGreece1 aPapatsiros, Vasileios 1 aPsalla, Dimitra 1 aKrabben, Ludwig 1 aKaufer, Benedikt 1 aDenner, J.q(Joachim),0 tMicroorganisms.g2022 Mar. 18, v. 10, no. 3dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27145x2076-26077nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/microorganisms100306523Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02559naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001900145245009900164300001600263520114700279592002801426650001601454650001101470650001601481650001301497650001301510650001301523650001001536650002901546650002001575650000901595650001201604650001201616650001101628650001801639700001701657700001801674700002801692700002401720700002101744700002101765700002301786700002001809700002301829773012501852856007901977852000902056655001202065IND60300851620221120025141.0150703e20130118xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6030085162DNAL7 a10.1126/science.12267672doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBarik, Jacques10aChronic Stress Triggers Social Aversion via Glucocorticoid Receptor in Dopaminoceptive Neurons  ap. 332-335.  aDefeat, Distress, and Glucocorticoids Understanding how individuals control emotions and cope with stressful events is a major clinical concern and of importance for the treatment of psychiatric illnesses (see the Perspective by McEwen).

(p. 335) found that isolation stress during adolescence, which does not cause any long-lasting changes in wild-type mice, induced significant neurochemical and behavioral alterations in mutant mice expressing a dominant-negative variant of the disrupted in schizophrenia 1 gene under the control of the prion protein promoter. These deficits could be reversed by a glucocorticoid receptor antagonist.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadolescence 3aadults 3aantagonists 3adistress 3adopamine 3aemotions 3agenes 3aglucocorticoid receptors 3aglucocorticoids 3amice 3amutants 3aneurons 3aprions 3aschizophrenia1 aMarti, Fabio1 aMorel, Carole1 aFernandez, Sebastian P.1 aLanteri, Christophe1 aGodeheu, Gérard1 aTassin, Jean-Pol1 aMombereau, Cédric1 aFaure, Philippe1 aTronche, François0 tScience.g2013 Jan. 18, v. 339, no. 6117 p.332-335dAmerican Association for the Advancement of Sciencex0036-80757nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.12267673Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03397naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100006100142245012400203500002000327520165700347592002802004596004302032596004502075596005902120596005002179650001702229650001502246650001302261650002202274650000902296650001802305650001302323650001302336650001102349700005902360700005602419700006702475700006302542700006302605700006002668773013702728856007702865852000902942655001202951IND60789752320221118034826.0220822e202010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078975232DNAL7 a10.1029/2020JC0162862doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHolmes, Thomas M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8061-432510aGlacial and Hydrothermal Sources of Dissolved Iron (II) in Southern Ocean Waters Surrounding Heard and McDonald Islands  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe Southern Ocean is the largest region in which iron limits the growth of phytoplankton. However, a phytoplankton bloom thousands of square kilometers in area forms each spring–summer in the Indian sector of the Southern Ocean, both above and to the east of the Kerguelen Plateau. The central region of the Kerguelen Plateau hosts the volcanically active islands, Heard and McDonald (HIMI), the former of which is largely covered by glaciers. The sources and processes governing supply of iron from HIMI to the region are relatively unknown. In the austral summer of 2016, the first voyage to focus on biogeochemical cycling in the HIMI region was undertaken (GEOTRACES process study GIpr05). Using dissolved iron (II) (DFe (II)) and hydrogen peroxide (H₂O₂) measurements, we are able to resolve iron sources and show that each of the adjacent islands are strong sources of reduced iron, though controlled by different supply mechanisms. At Heard Island, the greatest DFe (II) concentrations (0.57 nmol L⁻¹) were detected north of the island. An inverse correlation of DFe (II) concentrations with salinity suggests the origin is from a sea‐terminating glacier on the island. At McDonald Islands, the greatest DFe (II) concentrations (1.01 nmol L⁻¹) were detected east of the islands, which, based on DFe (II) profiles from five targeted stations, appear likely to originate from shallow diffuse hydrothermalism. Elevated DFe (II) around HIMI may increase Fe availability for biota and has implications for transport of Fe away from the islands to the broader northern Kerguelen Plateau where the annual plankton bloom is strongest.  aPublisher supplied data  aLE0989539cAustralian research council  aDP150100345cAustralian research council  aDP150100345 and LE0989539cAustralian research council  aAAS4338cAustralian Antarctic Science Program 3aalgal blooms 3ageophysics 3aglaciers 3ahydrogen peroxide 3airon 3aphytoplankton 3aresearch 3asalinity 3asummer1 aWuttig, Kathrin1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4010-59181 aChase, Zanna1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5060-779X1 aSchallenberg, Christina1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3073-75001 avan der Merwe, Pier1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7428-80301 aTownsend, Ashley T.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2972-26781 aBowie, Andrew R.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5144-77990 tJournal of geophysical research.g2020 Oct., v. 125, no. 10 p.e2020JC016286-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:27942x2169-92757nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2020JC0162863Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02686naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001800152245012500170300001600295520127100311592002801582650002101610650001501631650001401646650000901660650001601669650001301685650001501698650001401713650002201727650001201749650001101761650002101772650001301793650001301806650001501819650001101834650001401845653001501859653002001874653001601894700001701910700001801927700001601945773013501961856008702096852000902183655001202192IND60776790620221121051142.0220531e20220615xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077679062DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2022.04.2062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Yanqing14aThe hypoglycemic and hypolipemic potentials of Moringa oleifera leaf polysaccharide and polysaccharide-flavonoid complex  ap. 518-529.  aIn this study, Moringa oleifera leaf (MOL) flavonoids (MOLF) with strong α-glucosidase inhibitory activity and MOL polysaccharides (MOLP) with strong cholic acid-binding capacity were efficiently prepared by two-stage extraction method and mixed in a certain proportion for development of MOL highly-processed products with hypoglycemic and hypolipemic potentials.

MOLP constructed by galactose, arabinose, rhamnose and galacturonic acid possessed the strongest effects on delaying glucose diffusion and dialysis, delaying starch digestion, binding bile acids and inhibiting cholesterol micelle solubility, being the best MOL highly-processed products for regulating carbohydrate and lipid digestion and absorption. MOLF and MOLP had synergistic effect on delaying glucose diffusion and dialysis, delaying starch digestion and binding bile acids, while MOLF impaired the inhibitory effect of MOLP on cholesterol micelle solubility. Compared with MOL primary-processed products including MOL powder and de-phenolic MOL powder, MOL highly-processed products including MOLP and MOLF-MOLP complex possessed stronger hypoglycemic/hypolipemic potentials.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMoringa oleifera 3aabsorption 3aarabinose 3abile 3acholesterol 3adialysis 3aflavonoids 3agalactose 3agalacturonic acid 3aglucose 3aleaves 3alipid metabolism 3amicelles 3arhamnose 3asolubility 3astarch 3asynergism 0aFlavonoids 0aPolysaccharides 0aCombination1 aLin, Lianzhu1 aZhao, Mouming1 aYang, Xinyi0 tInternational journal of biological macromolecules.g2022 June 15, v. 210 p.518-529dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12340x0141-81307nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2022.04.2063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02111naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002300139245008100162520097800243592002801221650002301249650001101272650001001283650002201293650001401315650001201329651001301341651001001354700002101364700002201385700003101407700002301438700002201461700001801483700002001501773012101521856007401642852000901716655001201725IND60763592920221123010420.0220120e20220109xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076359292DNAL7 a10.3390/v140101132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlkhovsky, Sergey 10aSARS-like Coronaviruses in Horseshoe Bats (Rhinolophus spp.) in Russia, 2020  aWe found and genetically described two novel SARS-like coronaviruses in feces and oral swabs of the greater (R. ferrumequinum) and the lesser (R. hipposideros) horseshoe bats in southern regions of Russia. The viruses, named Khosta-1 and Khosta-2, together with related viruses from Bulgaria and Kenya, form a separate phylogenetic lineage. We found evidence of recombination events in the evolutionary history of Khosta-1, which involved the acquisition of the structural proteins S, E, and M, as well as the nonstructural genes ORF3, ORF6, ORF7a, and ORF7b, from a virus that is related to the Kenyan isolate BtKY72. The examination of bats by RT-PCR revealed that 62.5% of the greater horseshoe bats in one of the caves were positive for Khosta-1 virus, while its overall prevalence was 14%. The prevalence of Khosta-2 was 1.75%.

However, the roles of many PRPs remain unknown, including elucidation of which PRPs are essential or display redundancy. Here, we report that the nuclear-encoded PLASTID RIBOSOMAL PROTEIN L5 (PRPL5) is essential for early embryo development in A. thaliana, as homozygous loss-of-function mutations in the PRPL5 gene impairs chloroplast development and leads to embryo failure to develop past the globular stage. We confirmed the prpl5 embryo-lethal phenotype by generating a mutant CRISPR/Cas9 line and by genetic complementation. As PRPL5 underwent transfer to the nuclear genome early in the evolution of Embryophyta, PRPL5 can be expected to have acquired a chloroplast transit peptide. We identify and validate the presence of an N-terminal chloroplast transit peptide, but unexpectedly also confirm the presence of a conserved and functional Nuclear Localization Signal on the protein C-terminal end. This study highlights the fundamental role of the plastid translation machinery during the early stages of embryo development in plants and raises the possibility of additional roles of plastid ribosomal proteins in the nucleus.  aPublisher supplied data  a13/IA/1820cScience Foundation Ireland  aGOIPG/2017/1219cIrish Research Council for Science, Engineering and Technology 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3aCRISPR-Cas systems 3achloroplast transit peptides 3achloroplasts 3aembryogenesis 3aevolution 3agenes 3agenetic complementation 3ahomozygosity 3aloss-of-function mutation 3amutants 3anuclear genome 3anuclear localization signals 3aphenotype 3aplant reproduction 3aribosomal proteins 3aribosomes1 aMcDermott, Emma1 aCashell, Ronan1 aScian, Anna1 aMcHale, Marcus1 aRyder, Peter1 ade Groot, Joelle1 aLucca, Noel1 aBrychkova, Galina1 aMcKeown, Peter C.1 aSpillane, Charlie,1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3318-323X0 tPlant reproduction.g2022 Sept., v. 35, no. 3 p.189-204dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:12165x2194-79537nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00497-022-00440-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02567naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001600152245012000168520124900288592002801537650002101565650001401586650002201600650002001622650001801642650001101660650002101671650001601692653002101708653003001729653002201759653002001781700002001801700002001821700002701841700001501868700001801883700001401901700002401915773009801939856008702037852000902124655001202133IND60700329820221120221905.0200831e20201001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070032982DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apenergy.2020.1153372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCao, Jingyu10aPerformance characteristics of variable conductance loop thermosyphon for energy-efficient building thermal control  aVariable conductance loop thermosyphon (VCLT) manipulates natural phase-change cycle to regulate the heat transfer. Its primary advantages include high sustainability, simple design and low cost. One of the potential applications of variable conductance loop thermosyphon is thermal control in buildings for achieving high energy efficiency. In this study, a distributed steady-state model was implemented to determine the heat transfer control characteristics of variable conductance loop thermosyphon for the first time and evaluate its effectiveness on precise air-conditioning for buildings. The internal flow resistance rises from 0.002 K/W to 0.305 K/W and the heat transfer rate decreases from 468.5 W to 71.9 W when the relative opening degree of the regulating valve reduces from 1.00 to 0.17 under normal boundary conditions. The thermodynamic analyses show that the regulating valve of the variable conductance loop thermosyphon can enable effective thermal control over a wide range of heat transfer rate to accomplish indoor thermal comfort. The study also reveals that variable conductance loop thermosyphon can be effectively adopted with various working fluids and over wide ranges of heat source and heat sink temperatures.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair conditioning 3abuildings 3aenergy efficiency 3aflow resistance 3aheat transfer 3amodels 3aphase transition 3atemperature 0aAir-conditioning 0aEnergy-efficient building 0aLoop thermosyphon 0aNumerical study1 aHong, Xiaoqiang1 aZheng, Zhanying1 aʻĀṣim, Muḥammad,1 aHu, Mingke1 aWang, Qiliang1 aPei, Gang1 aLeung, Michael K.H.0 tApplied energy.g2020 Oct. 01, v. 275 p.115337-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11876x0306-26197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2020.1153373Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03210naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024005700092040001800149100002000167245011200187300001600299520182700315592002802142650002402170650001802194650001602212650001902228650001802247650001602265650001102281650001702292650001702309653002402326653002602350653002102376653001702397653001802414700002202432700002302454700002002477700002502497773010302522856011702625961001302742852000902755655001202764IND4477507020221122214754.0151127e200305  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447750702DNAL7 a10.1614/0043-1745(2003)051[0379:SJGACP]2.0.CO;22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYoung, Frank L.10aSpring-germinating jointed goatgrass (Aegilops cylindrica) produces viable spikelets in spring-seeded wheat  ap. 379-385.  aThe most common strategy recommended for management of jointed goatgrass infestations is to rotate from winter wheat to a spring crop for several years. A field study was conducted at three locations in 1998 and 1999 to determine the effects of spring seeding date on the ability of jointed goatgrass to flower and produce viable seed in the presence or absence of spring wheat and to determine the effect of jointed goatgrass competition and crop seeding date on spring wheat grain yield. Spring wheat was seeded on four dates at each location in both hand-sown and natural jointed goatgrass infestations. Jointed goatgrass plants from hand-sown spikelets flowered and developed spikelets on all seeding dates except the last; viable seed was produced on the two earliest seeding dates. Jointed goatgrass plant densities from natural infestations were from 1 to 12 plants m⁻⁻², and spikelet production ranged from 0 to 480 spikelets m⁻⁻². Natural jointed goatgrass infestations produced spikelets containing viable seed on all seeding dates at one location in 1998, the driest location. Spring wheat yield was not affected by jointed goatgrass competition; however, jointed goatgrass spikelet production was reduced by spring wheat competition compared with that of monoculture jointed goatgrass. The last seeding date of spring wheat was associated with 51%% less crop yield compared with the recommended seeding date. The decision to manage jointed goatgrass infestations with a spring crop rotation should consider delayed seeding dates to minimize viable spikelet production by spring-germinating jointed goatgrass; however, the cost of this decision may include grain yield reduction.Nomenclature: Jointed goatgrass, Aegilops cylindrica Host.

The time series of SST and Chl‐a before and after typhoons are composited for all typhoon locations to assess their responses. Decreases in SST and increases in Chl‐a occur after 73% and 70% of the typhoons, respectively, with overall averaged changes equal to −0.42 ± 0.015°C and 0.056 ± 0.003 log₁₀ mg/m³, respectively. The largest responses are found near the typhoon center, and the extent of changes in these parameters decreases linearly with distance. The SST responds rapidly, starting to drop 2 days ahead of the typhoon passage and continuing to drop until 2 days after its passage. On the other hand, the Chl‐a increases after the typhoon passage, remaining high for 5 days before beginning to return to the initial conditions. Large (weak) changes are associated with typhoons that have high (low) wind speeds and slow (fast) translation speeds. This is especially true for SST, whereas some typhoons with slow translation speeds are characterized by increases in Chl‐a, mostly occurring near the coast. The largest SST and Chl‐a changes induced by a single typhoon are found in the upwelling region off Vietnam. The study offers a comprehensive quantitative analysis that describes the general pattern of SST and Chl‐a responses to typhoons in the SCS.  aPublisher supplied data  a41806026cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a41890805cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  aXDB42000000cStrategic Priority Research Program, Chinese Academy of Sciences, China 3achlorophyll 3acoasts 3ageophysics 3aquantitative analysis 3aresearch 3asurface water temperature 3atime series analysis 3atyphoons 3aSouth China Sea 3aVietnam0 tJournal of geophysical research.g2020 Oct., v. 125, no. 10 p.e2020JC016243-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:27942x2169-92757nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2020JC0162433Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03859naa a2200649 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002500152245016100177520173000338592002802068650001802096650002402114650001302138650002002151650002402171650001102195650001902206650002902225650002002254650001602274650002202290650001702312650001202329650001902341650001802360650002302378650002402401650001002425650000902435650002402444650001702468650003102485650001302516650002502529650003202554653002202586653002102608653002402629653002102653653001902674700007002693700002402763700003402787700003102821700003002852700002802882700003102910700007002941773009003011856008703101852000903188655001203197IND60674175420221116191737.0191231e202001  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067417542DNAL7 a10.1016/j.peptides.2019.1701752doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSimon, Kellen Ugioni10aIntranasal insulin treatment modulates the neurotropic, inflammatory, and oxidant mechanisms in the cortex and hippocampus in a low-grade inflammation model  aThe inflammatory process plays a critical role in the development of neurodegenerative diseases. Insulin is used in preclinical and clinical studies of neurological disorders. Its intranasal (IN) administration directly in the brain allows for its peripheral metabolic effects to be avoided. Swiss male mice were injected with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (0.1 mg/kg) to induce low-grade inflammation. IN insulin treatment was initiated 4 h later at a dose of 1.7 IU once daily for 5 days. LPS induced cognitive deficits, which the IN insulin treatment reversed. LPS significantly decreased, whereas IN insulin significantly increased the levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and nerve growth factor-β in the cortex. In the hippocampus, IN insulin significantly decreased the BDNF level. LPS significantly increased the interleukin (IL)-6 levels in the cortex, while IN Insulin significantly decreased its levels in the hippocampus. The tumor necrosis factor-α levels were significantly decreased by IN insulin both in the cortex and hippocampus. Moreover, IN insulin significantly increased the IL-10 levels in the cortex. The levels of oxidative and nitrosative stress were significantly higher in the LPS-treated mice; however, IN insulin had a modulatory effect on both. LPS significantly increased the antioxidant enzyme activity both in the cortex and hippocampus, whereas IN insulin significantly increased the activity of both superoxide dismutase and catalase in the hippocampus and that of catalase in the cortex. The hydrogen peroxide levels revealed that LPS significantly affected the electron transport chain. Therefore, IN insulin could be useful in the treatment of neuroinflammatory diseases.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal models 3aantioxidant enzymes 3acatalase 3aclinical trials 3acognitive disorders 3acortex 3adisease models 3aelectron transport chain 3aenzyme activity 3ahippocampus 3ahydrogen peroxide 3ainflammation 3ainsulin 3ainterleukin-10 3ainterleukin-6 3alaboratory animals 3alipopolysaccharides 3amales 3amice 3anerve growth factor 3anerve tissue 3aneurodegenerative diseases 3aoxidants 3asuperoxide dismutase 3atumor necrosis factor-alpha 0aNeuroinflammation 0aBrain metabolism 0aLearning and memory 0aOxidative stress 0aDrugs delivery1 aPastoris Muller, Alexandre1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9961-86141 aNeto, Elias Wiggers1 aTramontin, Natalia dos Santos1 aCanteiro, Paula Bortoluzzi1 aPereira, Barbara da Costa1 aZaccaron, Rubya Pereira1 aSilveira, Paulo Cesar Lock1 aMuller, Alexandre Pastoris1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9961-86140 tPeptides.g2020 Jan., v. 123 p.170175-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:11832x0196-97817nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.peptides.2019.1701753Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02459naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005200148245008000200520118100280592002801461650001901489650002501508650002201533650002601555650001901581650001701600651001001617653003501627653002501662653002201687700005201709700001701761700005601778700001701834700001401851773011601865856008301981852000902064655001202073IND60727712620221118002458.0211106e202104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072771262DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ufug.2021.1270092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Yu1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5100-339710aCan smaller parks limit green gentrification? Insights from Hangzhou, China  aUrban green spaces can improve residents’ health and well-being. However, international research shows that urban greening can produce gentrification effects. A dilemma for planners is determining whether the scale of greening or the characteristics of green spaces is driving gentrification. In this article, Canonical correlation analysis (CCA) and field investigations are used to assess the potential gentrification effects of a new public green space in the urban central area of Hangzhou, China. Hangzhou is one of China’s ‘garden cities’, but rapid urbanization and climate change are increasing urban heat-island impacts, requiring large-scale urban greening. The two-stage CCA not only confirms the green gentrification phenomenon within the study area but suggests that large green spaces appear to foster gentrification due to their functional benefits, favorable policy support, elaborate embellishments, and strict management and maintenance regimes. Appropriate policy responses may include using a ‘just green enough’ approach: whereby distributed smaller green spaces, with less stringent maintenance could resolve the green gentrification paradox.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclimate change 3agreen infrastructure 3aissues and policy 3amultivariate analysis 3aurban forestry 3aurbanization 3aChina 0aCanonical correlation analysis 0aGreen gentrification 0aUrban green space1 aXu, Zike1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1833-520X1 aByrne, Jason1 aXu, Tiantian1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0800-40251 aWang, Shiwen1 aWu, Jiayu0 tUrban forestry & urban greening.g2021 Apr., v. 59 p.127009-dElsevier GmbHwJournal:jnl893556x1618-86677nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ufug.2021.1270093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02878naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100003800152245009000190520162300280592002801903650001601931650001101947650001701958650001701975650001701992650001602009650001402025651001102039653001802050653001902068653002402087653002602111653003502137700003502172700002502207700002202232700002002254773009802274856008702372852000902459655001202468IND60700330120221120023416.0200831e20201001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070033012DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apenergy.2020.1153612doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAndrade Furtado, Gilton Carlos de10aUsing hydropower waterway locks for energy storage and renewable energies integration  aWaterway are one of the most efficient means for transportation. It can be applied for energy storage demonstrating the potential of using these structures with renewable energy systems, here, through an analysis of energy alternatives. This paper analyzes two different solutions for energy supply, using the Locks of the Tucuruí powerplant, in Brazil. A photovoltaic power station is compared to a hybrid system composed by photovoltaic and pumped storage. The alternatives are discussed technically and economically. The energy costs of the scenarios are calculated based on the evolution of the expenses and the related payback time are found. The water resource is exploited responsibly, keeping balanced the pumped and turbined volumes of water. The grid works as an intermediate storage and allows the operations with a single pump-turbine conversion. Its location lowers down the initial investment in favor of the hybrid system as the more viable alternative. It was found that the locks could be used to handle up to 263 kW and 387 kW of electricity in turbine and pump mode, respectively. This paper gathers crucial data on the use of hydropower in waterways locks that support the integration of renewable energies surrounding the locks. In addition, the use of pumped storage plants to store energy from intermittent sources, present themselves as an innovative opportunity to, using the own head available at facility, improve the financial return of meeting the energy demand through an economically and environmentally responsible energy system, may be useful in similar facilities around the world.  aPublisher supplied data 3aelectricity 3aenergy 3aenergy costs 3apower plants 3asolar energy 3awater power 3awaterways 3aBrazil 0aHybrid system 0aTucuruí locks 0aPhotovoltaic energy 0aPump as turbine (PAT) 0aRenewable energy sources (RES)1 aAmarante Mesquita, André Luiz1 aMorabito, Alessandro1 aHendrick, Patrick1 aHunt, Julian D.0 tApplied energy.g2020 Oct. 01, v. 275 p.115361-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11876x0306-26197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2020.1153613Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02761naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002300152245014400175520168900319592002802008650002102036650001602057650002202073650002102095650001902116650001402135650001102149650001602160650001702176700001802193773012802211856008702339852000902426655001202435IND60771361820221120034453.0220325e20220318xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077136182DNAL7 a10.3390/microorganisms100306562doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWilson, Caitlin K.10aShort-Term Exposure to Thermophilic Temperatures Facilitates CO Uptake by Thermophiles Maintained under Predominantly Mesophilic Conditions  aThree phylogenetically and phenotypically distinct CO-oxidizing thermophiles (Alicyclobacillus macrosporangiidus CPP55 (Firmicutes), Meiothermus ruber PS4 (Deinococcus-Thermus) and Thermogemmatispora carboxidovorans PM5ᵀ (Chloroflexi)) and one CO-oxidizing mesophile (Paraburkholderia paradisi WAᵀ (Betaproteobacteria)) isolated from volcanic soils were used to assess growth responses and CO uptake rates during incubations with constant temperatures (25 °C and 55 °C) and during multi-day incubations with a temperature regime that cycled between 20 °C and 55 °C on a diurnal basis (alternating mesophilic and thermophilic temperatures, AMTT). The results were used to test a conjecture that some thermophiles can survive in mesothermal habitats that experience occasional thermophilic temperatures. Meiothermus ruber PS4, which does not form spores, was able to grow and oxidize CO under all conditions, while the spore-forming Alicyclobacillus macrosporangiidus CPP55 grew and oxidized CO during the AMTT regime and at 55 °C, but was not active at 25 °C. Thermogemmatispora carboxidovorans PM5ᵀ, also a spore former, only grew at 55 °C but oxidized CO during AMTT and 55 °C incubations. In contrast, the non-sporing mesophile, Paraburkholderia paradisi WAᵀ, was only able to grow and oxidize CO at 25 °C; growth and CO uptake ceased during the AMTT incubations after exposure to the initial round of thermophilic temperatures. Collectively, these results suggest that temporary, periodic exposure to permissive growth temperatures could help maintain populations of thermophiles in mesothermal habitats after deposition from the atmosphere or other sources.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAlicyclobacillus 3aChloroflexi 3aMeiothermus ruber 3aParaburkholderia 3aacute exposure 3aphylogeny 3aspores 3atemperature 3athermophiles1 aKing, Gary M.0 tMicroorganisms.g2022 Mar. 18, v. 10, no. 3dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27145x2076-26077nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/microorganisms100306563Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03496naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245015300165300001600318520212000334592002802454650001802482650001802500650002102518650001702539650001702556650000902573650002302582650001702605650001602622650002302638650001002661650001402671650001602685650001202701651001102713700001402724700001502738700001602753700001802769700001402787773011102801856008202912990002302994852000903017655001203026IND60097661520221119215035.0141104e20111020xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009766152DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecss.2011.07.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDesguée, R.10aContribution of hydrodynamic conditions during shallow water stages to the sediment balance on a tidal flat: Mont-Saint-Michel Bay, Normandy, France  ap. 343-354.  aField measurements were conducted in Mont-Saint-Michel Bay, a megatidal embayment (spring tidal range of 15 m), in order to monitor, over the course of a tidal cycle, sediment transport variability due to waves and tides on the upper part of a tidal flat characterised by shallow water depths. Sensors used to measure currents, water depth and turbidity were installed just above the bed (0.04 m). Two experiments were conducted under contrasting hydrodynamic conditions. The results highlight wave activity over the tidal flat even though observed wind waves were largely dissipated due to the very shallow water depths. Very high suspended sediment concentrations (up to 6 kg/m³) were recorded in the presence of wave activity at the beginning of the local flood, when significant sediment transport occurred, up to 7 times as much as under conditions of no wave activity. This influence may be attributed to the direct action of waves on bed sediments, to wave-induced liquefaction, and to the erosive action of waves on tidal channel banks. The sediment composition, comprising a clay fraction of 2–5%, may also enhance sediment transport by reducing critical shear stress through the sand lubrication effect. The results also show that antecedent meteorological conditions play an important role in suspended sediment transport on the tidal flat. Total sediment flux directions show a net transport towards the inner part of the bay that contributes to deposition over the adjacent salt marshes, and this tendency also prevails during strong wave conditions. Such sediment transport is characterised by significant variability over the course of the tidal cycle. During fair and moderate weather conditions, 83% and 71% of the total flux was observed, respectively, over only 11% and 28% of the duration of the local tidal cycle and with water depths between 0.04 and 0.3 m. These results suggest that in order to improve our understanding of sediment budgets in this type of coastal environment, it is essential to record data just at the beginning and at the end of tidal submergence close to the bed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclay fraction 3ahydrodynamics 3ahydrologic cycle 3aliquefaction 3asalt marshes 3asand 3asediment transport 3ashear stress 3asubmergence 3asuspended sediment 3atides 3aturbidity 3awater waves 3aweather 3aFrance1 aRobin, N.1 aGluard, L.1 aMonfort, O.1 aAnthony, E.J.1 aLevoy, F.0 tEstuarine, coastal and shelf science.g2011 Oct. 20, v. 94, no. 4 p.343-354dElsevier Ltdx0272-77147nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecss.2011.07.0103Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02625naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001500152245012600167500001900293520125500312592002801567596004501595650002101640650002801661650001301689650002401702650001801726650001001744650001901754650001201773650001701785650002601802650001701828653002401845653003401869700005601903700002001959700001701979773011101996856008702107852000902194655001202203IND60674175620221116192003.0200106e202004  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067417562DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jfoodeng.2019.1097712doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYi, Jiyoon10aQuantitative analysis and influences of contact dynamics on bacterial cross-contamination from contaminated fresh produce  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aCross-contamination of fresh produce during postharvest processing could be a significant risk factor that can lead to foodborne outbreaks. The aim of this study was to simulate cross-contamination from a contaminated lettuce to non-contaminated leaves/abiotic surfaces (glass, polyethylene), quantify the bacterial transfer efficiency to determine the influences of contact time, number of repeated contacts, and applied contact force, and evaluate the influences of surface hydrophobicity and bacterial species. The results demonstrate that bacterial transfer between leaves was instantaneous and bi-directional. The leaf-to-leaf transfer efficiency of Listeria innocua increased up to 6.8% with an applied contact force of 20 N, a force equivalent to 2-kg stack of lettuce leaves, while it had limited influence on transfer of a plant-associated bacterium, Pseudomonas fluorescens. The transfer efficiencies for both bacteria increased with the increase in hydrophobicity of abiotic surfaces. Overall, this study illustrates a quantitative approach to characterize the influence of physical and biological factors in influencing cross-contamination and could guide development of preventive measures for reducing the risk of cross-contamination.  aPublisher supplied data  cUSDAdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100000199 3aListeria innocua 3aPseudomonas fluorescens 3abacteria 3across contamination 3afresh produce 3aglass 3ahydrophobicity 3alettuce 3apolyethylene 3aquantitative analysis 3arisk factors 0aCross-contamination 0aBacterial transfer efficiency1 aHuang, Gang,1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6143-561X1 aYoung, Glenn M.1 aNitin, Nitin0 tJournal of food engineering.g2020 Apr., v. 270 p.109771-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl34294x0260-87747nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jfoodeng.2019.1097713Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01606naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100006700149245006600216300001800282520059900300592002800899650001400927650001600941650001000957650001600967650001200983650003000995700006301025773012301088856008401211852000901295655001201304IND60696488020200918000000.0200918e20200429xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069648802DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.chemrev.0c000022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWojaczyńska, Elżbieta1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1359-050010aModern Stereoselective Synthesis of Chiral Sulfinyl Compounds  ap. 4578-4611.  aChiral sulfinyl compounds, sulfoxides, sulfoximines, sulfinamides, and other derivatives, play an important role in asymmetric synthesis as versatile auxiliaries, ligands, and catalysts.

In Silico chloroplast SSRs mining of Olea species. Biodiversitas 13: 114-117. Simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers are highly informative and have been widely applied as molecular markers in genetic studies. The purpose of present study is to analyze the occurrence and distribution of chloroplast SSRs in genic and intergenic regions from Olea species viz., Olea europaea, Olea europaea subsp. cuspidate, Olea europaea subsp. europaea, Olea europaea subsp. maroccana, Olea woodiana subsp. woodiana by using bioinformatics tools. We identified 1149 chloroplast SSRs (cpSSRs) in all genome and a total of 340 (29.6%) was located in genic regions. It was observed that the most abundant repeat types were found mononucleotide SSR (66.7 %) followed by trinucleotide SSR (28.3 %), dinucleotide (2.7%), tetranucleotide (1.5%) and pentanucleotide (0.8%). cpSSRs located in genic regions were identified only mono- and trinucleotide motifs, the most abundant of which was trinucleotide (16.2%) followed by mononucleotide (14.3%). All types of repeat motif (mono-, di-, tri-, tetra- and pentanucleotide) were detected except hexanucleotide motifs. According to SSRs analysis, the most abundant observed motifs were identified for mono-, di-, tri-, tetra- and pentanucleotide cpSSRs A/T, AT/TA, AAG/CTT, AAAG/AGTTT, and AATCC/ATTGG respectively. This study results provided scientific base for phylogenetics, evolutionary genetics and diversity studies on different Olea species in future.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aOlea europaea 3abioinformatics 3achloroplasts 3acomputer simulation 3agenome 3amicrosatellite repeats 3aphylogeny 0aOlea 0aolive 0achloroplast SSRs 0aSSR mining 0ain silico analysis1 aKoç, İbrahim,0 tBiodiversitas.g2012 July, v. 13, no. 3 p.114-117dMBI & UNS SolowJournal:27804x2085-47227nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle02770naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002100149245012400170300001800294520136200312592002801674650002901702650002101731650002201752650001501774650001601789650001401805650001101819650001701830650001101847650001701858650001601875650003701891700002801928700006301956700006102019700006602080773012202146856008302268852000902351655001202360IND60696488120221120145300.0200527e20200504xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069648812DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.chemrev.9b004172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRahmati, Mahmood10aChemical and Thermal Sintering of Supported Metals with Emphasis on Cobalt Catalysts During Fischer–Tropsch Synthesis  ap. 4455-4533.  aThis comprehensive critical review combines, for the first time, recent advances in nanoscale surface chemistry, surface science, DFT, adsorption calorimetry, and in situ XRD and TEM to provide new insights into catalyst sintering. This work provides qualitative and quantitative estimates of the extent and rate of sintering as functions of nanocrystal (NC) size, temperature, and atmosphere. This review is unique in that besides summarizing important, useful data from previous studies, it also advances the field through addition of (i) improved or new models, (ii) new data summarized in original tables and figures, and (iii) new fundamental perspectives into sintering of supported metals and particularly of chemical sintering of supported Co during Fischer–Tropsch synthesis. We demonstrate how the two widely accepted sintering mechanisms are largely sequential with some overlap and highly NC-size dependent, i.e., generally, small NCs sinter rapidly by Ostwald ripening, while larger NCs sinter slowly by crystallite migration and coalescence. In addition, we demonstrate how accumulated knowledge, principles, and recent advances, discussed in this review, can be utilized in the design of supported metal NCs highly resistant to sintering. Recommendations for improving the design of sintering experiments and for new research are addressed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFischer-Tropsch reaction 3aOstwald ripening 3aX-ray diffraction 3aadsorption 3acalorimetry 3acatalysts 3acobalt 3acrystallites 3amodels 3ananocrystals 3atemperature 3atransmission electron microscopy1 aSafdari, Mohammad-Saeed1 aFletcher, Thomas H.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9999-44921 aArgyle, Morris D.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9430-91451 aBartholomew, Calvin H.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4293-67340 tChemical reviews.g2020 May 04, v. 120, no. 10 p.4455-4533dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23337x1520-68907nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.chemrev.9b004173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03214naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006300148245012800211300001600339520168000355592002802035650001202063650001702075650002002092650002402112650002202136650001502158650002302173650001202196650000902208650002302217650001902240651001202259700006002271700005502331700005702386700006002443700005402503773014302557856008302700852000902783655001202792IND60786627920221121232108.0220805e202208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078662792DNAL7 a10.1007/s10841-022-00390-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDe Smedt, Pallieter1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3073-675112aA Red List of terrestrial isopods (Isopoda: Oniscidea) in Flanders (northern Belgium) and its implications for conservation  ap. 525-535.  aAlthough diversity and abundance of arthropods have been shown to decline globally, they are underrepresented in nature conservation efforts and policies. Belowground taxa are especially neglected, despite their key roles in ecosystem functioning. Terrestrial isopods are litter and soil dwelling and important contributors to litter decomposition and nutrient cycling among others. Yet their conservation status has hardly been assessed. We compared recent extensive citizen science data with historical records to assess a Red List status of the terrestrial isopods in Flanders (northern Belgium) according to the IUCN international standards. We calculated distribution trends (IUCN criterion A) and distribution ranges (IUCN criterion B) for all native species. In total, 34 species of terrestrial isopods occur in Flanders of which one is regionally extinct and ten are threatened. Threatened species are associated with old deciduous forests, coastal habitats, rivers and streams and ancient anthropogenic habitats. IMPLICATIONS FOR CONSERVATION: Terrestrial isopods are important decomposers. Assessment of their regional Red List status can set conservation priorities for this rarely assessed trophic level, and facilitate developing local nature conservation and management policies that are complementary to other species groups. Additionally, they share their habitats with a number of threatened species characteristic of old farms and small-scale farming systems. Therefore, this list will be of importance for the assessment of the conservation value of cultural heritage and old farming practices and their associated biodiversity, which is rarely considered.  aPublisher supplied data 3aIsopoda 3abiodiversity 3acitizen science 3aconservation status 3acultural heritage 3aecosystems 3aindigenous species 3ainsects 3asoil 3athreatened species 3atrophic levels 3aBelgium1 aBoeraeve, Pepijn1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3752-64071 aArijs, Gert1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0321-666X1 aSegers, Stijn1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4187-03631 aLambrechts, Jorg1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4042-78291 aMaes, Dirk1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7947-37880 tJournal of insect conservation.g2022 Aug., v. 26, no. 4 p.525-535dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:jnl3870062x1366-638X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10841-022-00390-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03298naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001400144245016400158300002000322520132500342592002801667596009801695596009801793596010601891596008101997596005102078650001002129650002402139650001302163650001702176650002102193650001802214650000702232650001502239653001402254653002802268653001902296653001602315653002802331700001202359700001602371700001402387700001602401700005602417700002002473700005702493773014202550856007902692852000902771655001202780IND60791747120221119163345.0220831e20220822xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079174712DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.2c036022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBian, Lei10aNaCl Micro-Crystal as a Molecular Mold for Enhanced Synthesis of Planar Phenazines and Their Applications on Chemosensing and a Full-Color Fluorescent Material  ap. 39441-39450.  aNaCl has been successfully used as a template for the synthesis of 2D nanomaterials, but it is seldom used for the construction of flat small organic molecules. Herein, a simple, low-cost, and highly efficient synthesis of phenazines with planar main frames, such as 5-phenyl-5,14-dihydro-5,7,12,14-tetraazapentacene, in the presence of NaCl micro-crystal as a kind of molecular mold is described. The reactants were mixed with NaCl powder and heated to 320 °C for 5 min. Yields >90% were readily achieved after a simple precipitation in water. The effectiveness of NaCl crystal as a mold with HCl was confirmed by comparison with common inorganic salts, SiO₂, and γ-Al₂O₃ with HCl together with combinations including NaNO₃ + HNO₃, Na₂SO₄ + H₂SO₄, NaH₂PO₄ + H₃PO₄, and NaH₂PO₄ + polyphosphoric acid. The mechanism was deduced with the aid of computer simulation, which confirms the stabilization of 5,14-dihydro-5,7,12,14-tetraazapentacene by the NaCl surface. DMSO solution of a product, 1,3-dihydro-imidazo[4,5-b]phenazin-2-one, showed enhanced fluorescence in H₂O, and it was used as a fluorescent probe for pH and Hg²⁺. A full-color material was prepared by mixing precursors of epoxy resin and phenazines, and its fluorescent color could be adjusted by the ratio of phenazines.  aPublisher supplied data  a21625501cNational Natural Science Foundation of Chinadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100001809  a21974057cNational Natural Science Foundation of Chinadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100001809  aBJJWZYJH01201910005017cBeijing Municipal Education Commissiondhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100003213  a2021B-208cGansu Education Departmentdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100009590  a21JR1RE298cGansu Provincedhttps://doi.org/NA 3acolor 3acomputer simulation 3aepoxides 3afluorescence 3afluorescent dyes 3ananomaterials 3apH 3aphenazines 0aphenazine 0aNaCl-enhanced synthesis 0amolecular mold 0aHg2+ sensor 0afull-color fluorescence1 aMa, Jie1 aAi, Jiebing1 aWang, Yan1 aWang, Naiyu1 aWang, Xiayan1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1735-00771 aGuo, Guangsheng1 aPu, Qiaosheng1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5241-71960 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2022 Aug. 22, v. 14, no. 34 p.39441-39450dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.2c036023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02857naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002500148245011300173300001600286520159300302592002801895650002101923650001101944650002401955650002901979650001402008650001502022650001802037650001402055650001702069650001802086650001502104650002502119650001302144650001602157651001902173700001902192773011002211856008202321990002302403852000902426655001202435IND60097662020221119214325.0141104e20111101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009766202DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecss.2011.08.0332doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPeierls, Benjamin L.10aLongitudinal and depth variation of bacterioplankton productivity and related factors in a temperate estuary  ap. 207-215.  aBacterioplankton productivity (BP) spatial variation was investigated in relation to potential resources, including primary productivity and dissolved organic matter, in the micro-tidal Neuse River–Pamlico Sound estuarine system, North Carolina, USA. Estuarine BP was predicted to correlate with the trophic gradient, decreasing along the salinity gradient in parallel with the decrease in organic matter and primary productivity. This prediction was tested over four years at spatial scales ranging from kilometers to meters along the riverine axis and with depth. The general pattern of BP across the salinity gradient was unimodal and matched the phytoplankton patterns in peak location and variability. Peak locations varied with discharge, especially in 2003 when above average discharge moved peaks downstream. Spatial coherence of BP with other variables was much less at short time scales. The effect of temperature, nutrients, and phytoplankton on BP varied by location, especially fresh versus brackish stations, although only temperature explained more than 20% of the BP variation. Depth variation of BP was as great as longitudinal variation and bottom samples were often higher than surface. BP was strongly correlated with particulate organic carbon at the pycnocline and bottom, highlighting the importance of particulate matter as a resource. Station-averaged BP and phytoplankton data corresponded well with two published meta-analyses, although the offset of the freshwater station suggested longitudinal differences in community composition or resource availability.  aPublisher supplied data 3abacterioplankton 3acarbon 3acommunity structure 3adissolved organic matter 3aestuaries 3afreshwater 3ameta-analysis 3anutrients 3aparticulates 3aphytoplankton 3aprediction 3aprimary productivity 3asalinity 3atemperature 3aNorth Carolina1 aPaerl, Hans W.0 tEstuarine, coastal and shelf science.g2011 Nov. 1, v. 95, no. 1 p.207-215dElsevier Ltdx0272-77147nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecss.2011.08.0333Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle04154naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006700148245012200215300001600337520279100353592002803144650001103172650001403183650001503197650001203212650001703224650001603241650001703257650001903274650002403293650001503317650001603332650000903348700003503357700005903392700007003451773014303521856008303664852000903747655001203756IND60786628120221120083758.0220805e202208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078662812DNAL7 a10.1007/s10841-022-00407-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBellaver, Juliane M.

A case study with neotropical butterflies and their host plants  ap. 651-661.  aClimate change is currently considered one key threat to biodiversity. Species with a restricted distribution possibly will be more affected than those with wide ranges. Climate change can potentially affect both herbivores and their host plants and reduce their geographical ranges. The nature and intensity of their responses, however, may not necessarily match. We investigated the synergistic effects of climate change on two Neotropical butterfly species and their respective host plants at the end of twenty-first century. The species selected contrast in distribution extent, feeding habits and conservation status: Battus polystictus is widespread, oligophagous and common and Parides ascanius has a restricted distribution, is monophagous and is listed as vulnerable in the IUCN red list. Maps of the potential distribution of the butterflies and their host plants, as well as maps showing the changes in the ranges, in overlap area and direction of shifts were produced. Under forecasted climate change, all ranges and interaction areas decreased and the impacts were proportional to the intensity of change in future scenarios, either when compared all together or pairwise (p < 0.001). Based in our results estimation of climatically suitability, the monophagous butterfly with restricted distribution did suffer more severely these effects than the widespread generalist species. We did not anticipate, however, the possible strength of the predicted effects. Under the conditions modelled, P. ascanius would probably find no suitable conditions for occurrence, irrespectively of its host plant, and might go extinct. B. polystictus, on the other hand, suffered marked decreases in suitable area (46% for RCP4.5 and 91% for RCP8.5) and dramatic southward shifts (> 1439 km for RCP4.5 and > 1956 km for RCP8.5) on its range. This effect is further worsening because although most host plants are also much affected by the changes, the shift in their ranges is on average much smaller and each species responded in subtly different ways to the changing conditions, so that most of their future range may be spatially incompatible with the B. polystictus. We propose that the extinction risk of P. ascanius should be adjusted to critically endangered and point that species interactions and climate change must be accounted for in conservation planning. IMPLICATIONS FOR INSECT CONSERVATION: The assessment carried out in this study contributes to the knowledge of climate change scenarios of butterfly species correlated with their host plants until the end of this century. These results can propose priority sites for conservation efforts like contribute to change status of P. ascanius to critically endangered, actually listed as vulnerable on the IUCN red list.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBattus 3aColtricia 3aNeotropics 3aParides 3abiodiversity 3abutterflies 3acase studies 3aclimate change 3aconservation status 3aextinction 3ahost plants 3arisk1 aLima-Ribeiro, Matheus de Souza1 aHoffmann, Diego1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7542-59331 aRomanowski, Helena Piccoli1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8342-46070 tJournal of insect conservation.g2022 Aug., v. 26, no. 4 p.651-661dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:jnl3870062x1366-638X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10841-022-00407-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01652naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001900139245010900158300001800267500001900285520038900304592002800693650002600721650001800747650002200765650001400787650001100801653001400812653001700826653001300843653002700856653001600883700002300899700002100922700002300943700002000966773018600986856007301172852000901245655001201254IND60692453920221122230231.0200502e20091223xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069245392DNAL7 a10.1271/bbb.904852doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKIKUTAKE, Chie14aThe C-Terminal Portion of an Archaeal Toxin, aRelE, Plays a Crucial Role in Protein Synthesis Inhibition  ap. 2766-2768.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aMutations of amino acids in the C-terminal region of an archaeal toxin, aRelE, from Pyrococcus horikoshii were characterized with respect to protein synthesis inhibitory activity and 70S ribosome-binding activity.

Given these unique circumstances, we examine the mesoscale eddy field in the Bay of Bengal (BoB) during 2019 and the interactions between these eddies and 3–7‐day synoptic oscillations and tropical systems, which contribute to monsoon rainfall and modulate the active (wet) and break (dry) phases of the Indian monsoon. We find that there is a drastic difference in eddy characteristics between the western (80–90°E) and eastern (90–100°E) BoB, where eddies in the eastern BoB are dominated by coastal Kelvin wave (CKW) dynamics and topographical influences, and the eddies in the western BoB are more heavily modulated by East India Coastal Current dynamics. We further find that the pIOD increased the overall sea level in the BoB and modified CKW propagation in the BoB such that all eddy types had more positive sea level anomalies. We find that cyclonic eddies vary coherently with both upper ocean heat content and 3–7‐day bandpass filtered precipitation and that both the number of cyclonic eddies and eddy amplitude increase in coherence with precipitation and ocean heat content following the passage of a tropical system. These results suggest a strong relationship between cyclonic eddies and 3–7‐day atmospheric variability.  aPublisher supplied data  aN00014‐17‐1‐2468cDOD | United States Navy | Office of Naval Research (ONR) 3ageophysics 3aheat 3amonsoon season 3arain 3aresearch 3asea level 3awater currents 3aBay of Bengal 3aIndia 3aIndian Ocean1 aSubrahmanyam, Bulusu1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3465-80651 aTrott, Corinne B.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1908-47131 aRoman‐Stork, Heather L.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2357-13430 tJournal of geophysical research.g2020 Oct., v. 125, no. 10 p.e2020JC016772-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:27942x2169-92757nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2020JC0167723Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03343naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001500148245012100163300001400284520164800298592002801946596005701974596005702031596005702088650001002145650002502155650000902180650001302189650000902202650002402211651001302235651001402248651001302262651001302275700005602288700001602344700005502360700005602415700002102471700005302492700005602545700005602601773012502657856008202782852000902864655001202873IND60744913120221120064610.0210721e202108  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074491312DNAL7 a10.1007/s10533-021-00813-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAshida, K.10aQuantitative relationship between organic carbon and geochemical properties in tropical surface and subsurface soils  ap. 77-95.  aWe investigated soil organic carbon (SOC) storage and the quantitative relationship between SOC and geochemical properties in tropical surface and subsurface soils, where information on various soil geochemical properties remains limited. We used soil samples from 178 sites in Indonesia, Thailand, Cameroon, and Tanzania as tropical soils and 34 sites in Japan as a comparison. The tropical soils were acidic, formed under high precipitation. We separated the soil samples into three groups based on the degree of weathering. We applied correlation and single regression analyses between SOC and geochemical properties including oxalate extractable Al and Fe (Alₒ + Feₒ), pyrophosphate extractable Al and Fe (Alₚ + Feₚ), and clay + silt. In the subsurface soils, Alₒ + Feₒ and Alₚ + Feₚ were strongly correlated with SOC (r = 0.79–0.85 and 0.58–0.85, respectively), and the quantitative relationships of SOC with these properties were similar in all the weathering groups (4–5 and 5–8, respectively). On the other hand, no strong correlation with SOC or similar quantitative relationships among the weathering groups were found for clay + silt. In the surface soils, Alₒ + Feₒ and Alₚ + Feₚ were correlated with SOC (r = 0.48–0.56 and 0.55–0.76, respectively), but the ratio of C to active Al and Fe was higher probably because of the large C input. Our results highlight the importance of Alₒ + Feₒ and Alₚ + Feₚ in SOC storage, of which the ratios to SOC are similar in each of the surface and subsurface soils regardless of the weathering degree.  aPublisher supplied data  a24228007cJapan Society for the Promotion of Science  a17H06171cJapan Society for the Promotion of Science  a18H02314cJapan Society for the Promotion of Science 3aJapan 3acarbon sequestration 3aclay 3aoxalates 3asilt 3asoil organic carbon 3aCameroon 3aIndonesia 3aTanzania 3aThailand1 aWatanabe, T.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6071-32861 aUrayama, S.1 aHartono, A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2884-94821 aKilasara, M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4737-98151 aMvondo Ze, A.

Moreover, micropollutants (e.g. pharmaceuticals and other contaminants) continuously enter aquatic environments via treated wastewater. However, there is a paucity of knowledge, whether extended exposure to secondary treated wastewater disrupts important ecosystem functions, e.g. leaf breakdown. Therefore, the amphipod shredder Gammarus fossarum was exposed to natural stream water (n = 34) and secondary treated wastewater (n = 32) for four weeks in a semi-static test system under laboratory conditions. G. fossarum exposed to wastewater showed significant reductions in feeding rate (25%), absolute consumption (35%), food assimilation (50%), dry weight (18%) and lipid content (22%). Thus, high proportions of wastewater in the stream flow may affect both the breakdown rates of leaf material and thus the availability of energy for the aquatic food web as well as the energy budget of G. fossarum.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGammarus fossarum 3aaquatic environment 3aaquatic food webs 3aclimate change 3adrugs 3aecosystems 3aenergy 3aleaves 3alipid content 3aphysiological state 3astream flow 3astreams 3asummer 3awastewater 2aAmphipodaxdrug effects 2aAnimals 2aWaste Disposal, Fluid 2aWater Pollutants, Chemicalxtoxicity1 aZubrod, Jochen P.1 aSchulz, Ralf0 tEnvironmental pollution.g2011 Jan., v. 159, no. 1 p.244-249dElsevier Ltdx0269-74917nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2010.08.0303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02900naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100005300142245015000195500002000345520164300365592002802008596007102036650001102107650000902118650001202127650001502139650001902154650001302173650002302186650001102209650003002220650001102250700005402261773013702315856007702452852000902529655001202538IND60789753520221118034830.0220822e202011  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078975352DNAL7 a10.1029/2020JC0163142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNagai, T.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6972-387010aCombined Effects of Tidal Mixing in Narrow Straits and the Ekman Transport on the Sea Surface Temperature Cooling in the Southern Indonesian Seas  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aAlthough the SST cooling events around the Lesser Sunda Islands (LSIs), which contribute to the seasonal variation of SST in the southern Indonesian Seas, are thought to be controlled by tidal mixing, the distribution of tidal mixing was highly idealized in previous studies. This study reinvestigates the mechanisms of such SST cooling events using MITgcm, which incorporates the realistic distribution of tidal mixing. The observed SST variability is well reproduced in the numerical experiment; SST is largely reduced along the northern (or southern) coast of the LSIs during austral summer (or winter). Particle tracking suggests that the narrow tidal straits between the LSIs, where well‐mixed waters are produced by vigorous tidal mixing, play a key role in controlling the SST cooling. During austral summer, the cold SST signal of well‐mixed waters propagates both northward and southward from the narrow straits as baroclinic Kelvin waves. On the northern side of the LSIs, in particular, coastal upwelling caused by the northwest monsoon raises the background thermocline, which affects the propagation of baroclinic Kelvin waves such that the accompanying cold SST signal becomes much enhanced compared with that on the southern side of the LSIs. During austral winter, in contrast, the Ekman transport enhances southward through‐strait flow so that baroclinic Kelvin waves can propagate only southward affecting the SST on the southern side of the LSIs. This demonstrates the importance of the combined effects of tidal mixing in narrow straits and the Ekman transport on the SST cooling in the southern Indonesian Seas.  aPublisher supplied data  a18H03731cMEXT | Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS) 3acoasts 3acold 3acooling 3ageophysics 3amonsoon season 3aresearch 3aseasonal variation 3asummer 3asurface water temperature 3awinter1 aHibiya, T.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3371-20930 tJournal of geophysical research.g2020 Nov., v. 125, no. 11 p.e2020JC016314-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:27942x2169-92757nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2020JC0163143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02299naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002300148245011000171300001600281520108200297592002801379650002801407650002201435650001601457650001901473650001501492650002401507650001601531650001401547650001601561651001201577700002001589700002201609700005901631773014301690856008301833852000901916655001201925IND60786628320221120083803.0220805e202208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078662832DNAL7 a10.1007/s10841-022-00413-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKukkonen, Jonna M.12aA strong decline of the endangered Apollo butterfly over 20 years in the archipelago of southern Finland  ap. 673-681.  aInsect groups are declining worldwide; Lepidoptera are among the taxa most affected in terrestrial ecosystems. The main drivers of these declines are a diverse set of factors relating to environmental change including habitat loss, pollution, and climate change. In 2019 and 2020, we surveyed 118 and 90 islands, respectively, in southern Finland’s archipelago for occupancy of Parnassius apollo larvae and counted the abundance of their host plant Hylotelephium telephium. Compared with historical data (1997–2003), the occupancy of Apollo butterfly larvae has decreased remarkably from about 75% to about 20% of islands and abundance declined as well. However, the abundance of their host plant has not changed. Occupancy models showed that the present occupancy probability is not affected by host plant numbers, and shows substantial colonization-extinction dynamics making the population vulnerable to stochastic extinction. IMPLICATIONS FOR INSECT CONSERVATION: Our results show that this Apollo butterfly population is declining, and conservation actions are needed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHylotelephium telephium 3aParnassius apollo 3abutterflies 3aclimate change 3aextinction 3ahabitat destruction 3ahost plants 3apollution 3aprobability 3aFinland1 aMussaari, Maija1 aFred, Marianne S.1 aBrommer, Jon E.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2435-26120 tJournal of insect conservation.g2022 Aug., v. 26, no. 4 p.673-681dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:jnl3870062x1366-638X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10841-022-00413-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01479naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100001800142245008200160300001800242520042500260592002800685650002300713650001400736650001300750700002300763700005600786700001800842700001800860700005600878773014600934856007601080852000901156655001201165IND60684933820221120130927.0200226e20200209xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068493382DNAL7 a10.1021/jacs.9b128822doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGuo, Yinliang10aTotal Synthesis of (−)-Batrachotoxinin A: A Local-Desymmetrization Approach  ap. 3675-3679.  aAn enantioselective total synthesis of (−)-batrachotoxinin A is accomplished based on a key photoredox coupling reaction and the subsequent local-desymmetrization operation.

Herein, we report the sequential synthesis of a hybrid nanocatalyst CoₓP@POP, where substoichiometric CoₓP nanoparticles are distributed in a porous organic polymer (POP) via solid-state phosphidation of the Co₃O₄@POP nanohybrid system. We also explored the catalytic activity of the above two nanohybrids toward the HDO of vanillin, a typical compound of lignin-derived bio-oil to 2-methoxy-4-methylphenol, which is a promising future biofuel. The CoₓP@POP exhibited superior catalytic activity and selectivity toward desired product with improved stability compared to the Co₃O₄@POP. Based on advanced sample characterization results, the extraordinary selectivity of CoₓP@POP is attributed to the strong interaction of the cation of the CoₓP nanoparticle with the POP matrix and the consequent modifications of the electronic states. Through attenuated total reflectance-infrared spectroscopy, we have also observed different interaction strengths between vanillin and the two catalysts. The decreased catalytic activity of Co₃O₄@POP compared to CoₓP@POP catalyst could be attributed to the stronger adsorption of vanillin over the Co₃O₄@POP catalyst. Also from kinetic investigation, it is clearly demonstrated that the Co₃O₄@POP has higher activation energy barrier than the CoₓP@POP, which also reflects to the reduction of the overall efficiency of the Co₃O₄@POP catalyst. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first approach in POP-encapsulated cobalt phosphide catalyst synthesis and comprehensive study in establishing the structure–activity relationship in significant step-forwarding in promoting biomass refining.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactivation energy 3aadsorption 3abiofuels 3abiomass 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3acations 3acobalt 3acobalt oxide 3alignocellulose 3ananohybrids 3ananoparticles 3ananosheets 3aphosphides 3apolymers 3arefining 3aspectroscopy 3astructure-activity relationships 3avanillin 0acobalt phosphide 0aporous organic polymer 0avanillin 0ahydrodeoxygenation (HDO) 0abiofuel 0aATR-IR1 aKoley, Paramita1 aJoseph, Boby1 aMarini, Carlo1 aNakka, Lingaiah1 aTardio, James1 aMondal, John1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7813-21080 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2019 June 14, v. 11, no. 27 p.24140-24153dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.9b067893Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02121naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100001400188245013600202300001800338506007600356520073000432592002801162506003701190650001501227650003101242650001701273650001701290650001801307650001701325650001601342650001901358650001701377700001601394700001701410700001501427700002001442700002001462773011501482856008101597852000901678655001201687IND60586051220221207133112.0171115e201712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058605122DNAL7 a10.1007/s13197-017-2902-32doi7 aPMC56860112pmcid7 a291842372pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHu, Ding,10aIdentification of bioactives from Astragalus chinensis L.f. and their antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and anti-proliferative effects  ap. 4315-4323.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThis work was designed to obtain the valuable compounds with antioxidant, anti-proliferative and anti-inflammatory activities from Astragalus chinensis.

Second-generational unit root test is used to address the issue of cross-sectional dependency. Mixed order of integration enabled us to use panel autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) method to investigate short-run and long-run association. Moreover, this study also employs Granger causality test to explore causalities among the selected variables. Empirical results reveal that FDI has a positive and statistically significant effect on environmental degradation. Institutional quality is measured as rule of law has insignificant impact on ecological footprint both in short run as well as long run. However, government stability decreases environmental degradation while corruption enhances environmental hazards tremendously. This study also supports environmental Kuznets curve (EKC) for the South Asian countries. This study emphasized the role of political institutions in environmental degradation. South Asian countries must focus on the implementation of environmental laws and regulations by improving the quality of institutions to achieve the goal of sustainable development.  aPublisher supplied data 3aecological footprint 3aenvironmental Kuznets curve 3aforeign direct investment 3apolitics 3apollution 3aresearch 3asustainable development1 aQayyum, Unbreen1 aMajeed, Tariq0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research international.g2020 Sept., v. 27, no. 26 p.32544-32553dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl4122550x0944-13447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-020-09464-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02431naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100002100138245008700159300001800246500001100264520103700275592002801312650002001340650001301360650002001373650002801393650001401421650001401435650001701449650001301466650001501479700001901494700002901513700003301542700002501575700001801600700002901618700001901647700001701666700002601683700005801709773012501767856007201892852000901964655001201973IND60751359120221121103133.0210924e202109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075135912DNAL7 a10.1002/ptr.71192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMorshedi, Korosh10aTherapeutic effect of curcumin in gastrointestinal cancers: A comprehensive review  ap. 4834-4897.  aREVIEW  aGastrointestinal (GI) cancers with a high global prevalence are a leading cause of morbidity and mortality. Accordingly, there is a great need to develop efficient therapeutic approaches. Curcumin, a naturally occurring agent, is a promising compound with documented safety and anticancer activities. Recent studies have demonstrated the activity of curcumin in the prevention and treatment of different cancers. According to systematic studies on curcumin use in various diseases, it can be particularly effective in GI cancers because of its high bioavailability in the gastrointestinal tract. Nevertheless, the clinical applications of curcumin are largely limited because of its low solubility and low chemical stability in water. These limitations may be addressed by the use of relevant analogues or novel delivery systems. Herein, we summarize the pharmacological effects of curcumin against GI cancers. Moreover, we highlight the application of curcumin's analogues and novel delivery systems in the treatment of GI cancers.  aPublisher supplied data 3abioavailability 3acurcumin 3adigestive tract 3agastrointestinal system 3amorbidity 3amortality 3aphytotherapy 3aresearch 3asolubility1 aBorran, Sarina1 aEbrahimi, Mohammad Saeid1 aMasoud khooy, Mohammad Jaber1 aSeyedi, Zeynab Sadat1 aAmiri, Atefeh1 aAbbasi‐Kolli, Mohammad1 aFallah, Maryam1 aKhan, Haroon1 aSahebkar, Amirhossein1 aMirzaei, Hamed1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9399-82810 tPhytotherapy research.g2021 Sept., v. 35, no. 9 p.4834-4897dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.wJournal:jnl47440x0951-418X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ptr.71193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02516naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100006600140245014500206300001600351500002000367520123700387592002801624596005201652650001301704650001501717650001001732700006201742700002101804700005901825700001601884700002001900700001801920700002201938773011001960856007502070852000902145655001202154IND60782233620221117172233.0220706e202206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078223362DNAL7 a10.1111/biom.134552doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aScharfstein, Daniel O.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7482-965310aGlobal sensitivity analysis of randomized trials with nonmonotone missing binary outcomes: Application to studies of substance use disorders  ap. 649-659.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aIn this paper, we present a method for conducting global sensitivity analysis of randomized trials in which binary outcomes are scheduled to be collected on participants at prespecified points in time after randomization and these outcomes may be missing in a nonmonotone fashion. We introduce a class of missing data assumptions, indexed by sensitivity parameters, which are anchored around the missing not at random assumption introduced by Robins (Statistics in Medicine, 1997). For each assumption in the class, we establish that the joint distribution of the outcomes is identifiable from the distribution of the observed data. Our estimation procedure uses the plug‐in principle, where the distribution of the observed data is estimated using random forests. We establish n$\sqrt {n}$ asymptotic properties for our estimation procedure. We illustrate our methodology in the context of a randomized trial designed to evaluate a new approach to reducing substance use, assessed by testing urine samples twice weekly, among patients entering outpatient addiction treatment. We evaluate the finite sample properties of our method in a realistic simulation study. Our methods have been implemented in an R package entitled slabm.  aPublisher supplied data  a1R01DA044158‐01cNational Institute of Health 3amedicine 3astatistics 3aurine1 aSteingrimsson, Jon1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2116-93771 aMcDermott, Aidan1 aWang, Chenguang1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7085-33031 aRay, Souvik1 aCampbell, Aimee1 aNunes, Edward1 aMatthews, Abigail0 tBiometrics.g2022 June, v. 78, no. 2 p.649-659dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl16956x0006-341X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/biom.134553Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03322naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100005100150245014000201520176500341592002802106650001202134650003002146650001902176650001702195650002402212650002002236650001502256650001302271650002602284650001702310650001302327650001502340650001302355650001402368650000702382650001402389650002002403650001702423650001702440653004702457653002402504653002102528700001602549700005502565773011402620856008502734852000902819655001202828IND60750811520221120040445.0211023e20211025xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075081152DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chroma.2021.4625542doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Wen1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1402-611910aScreening of lactate dehydrogenase inhibitor from bioactive compounds in natural products by electrophoretically mediated microanalysis  aLactate dehydrogenase (LDH) is a key enzyme in the glycolysis, which has been reported that the expression of LDH is elevated in a variety of cancer types and can promote tumor invasion and metastasis. Therefore, LDH has come to be an emerging therapeutic target for cancer. In this work, we described a new strategy for rapid screening of LDH inhibitors from natural products by integrating electrophoretically mediated microanalysis (EMMA), transverse diffusion of laminar flow profiles (TDLFP) and rapid pressure direction switching. LDH activity could be assayed by the quantification of the peak area of the produced β-Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide hydrate (NAD⁺) and the inhibitory effect on LDH was reflected by the reduction of NAD⁺ peak area. Parameters affecting CE separation and enzymatic reaction were evaluated, including the pH of background electrolyte, incubation time, methanol percentage and enzyme concentration. The Michaelis-Menten constant (Kₘ) determined on-line by EMMA method were 226.9 μM and 31.8 μM for substrates sodium pyruvate and NADH, respectively and the half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC₅₀) for the known positive inhibitor gossypol was determined to be 9.269 μM, which was comparable with the previous literature. Then the inhibitory activity of 12 bioactive compounds from natural products on LDH was investigated by employing the developed method. Three compounds including quercetin, luteolin, ursolic acid had potential inhibitory effect on LDH. Molecular docking study was implemented and well supported the experimental results. This study provides a potential tool for the preliminary screening of LDH inhibitors from bioactive compounds in natural products by capillary electrophoresis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadenine 3acapillary electrophoresis 3achromatography 3aelectrolytes 3aenzymatic reactions 3aenzyme kinetics 3aglycolysis 3agossypol 3alactate dehydrogenase 3alaminar flow 3aluteolin 3ametastasis 3amethanol 3aneoplasms 3apH 3aquercetin 3asodium pyruvate 3atherapeutics 3aursolic acid 0aElectrophoretically mediated microanalysis 0aInhibitor screening 0aNatural products1 aCui, Xinyue1 aChen, Zilin1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9824-99870 tJournal of chromatography.g2021 Oct. 25, v. 1656 p.462554-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl50504x0021-96737nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chroma.2021.4625543Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03684naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001400153245010100167300001300268520212300281592002802404650001302432650001102445650001202456650001702468650001102485650001202496650001702508650001302525650001302538650001202551650001502563650001102578650001402589650001102603650002402614650001502638650001202653650002302665651001002688653003102698653002402729653001402753653002402767653003602791653002602827700001902853700001802872700001202890700001502902773010402917856008803021852000903109655001203118IND60525815020221120112731.0190319e20160610xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052581502DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2016.03.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Na12aA cellular automaton model for grasshopper population dynamics in Inner Mongolia steppe habitats  ap. 5-17.  aWe developed a cellular automaton model for the spatiotemporal dynamics of grasshopper (Oedaleus decorus asiaticus) populations with a density of 3–12indm−2 in a typical semiarid steppe. The model simulates grasshopper dynamics within each cell and dispersal between adjacent cells at each time step from the completion of hatching to ovipositing. After the model parameters were obtained or calibrated, the natural growth of grasses (the preferred food of O. d. asiaticus), and their variation after being fed on by cattle and grasshoppers, were modeled to explore grasshopper–plant interactions. Dispersal rules were formulated by considering the abundance of grasshoppers and grasses and their interactions within both potential source and sink cells, habitat conditions of sink cells, and spatial isolation (or connectedness) between source and sink cells. A case study was conducted at a sample landscape in Xianghuangqi County, Inner Mongolia, China. The temporal variations of the modeled grass biomass and grasshopper density were consistent with actual variations. The modeled densities were within the measured ranges for most of the cells. The estimation accuracy was higher for the 4th and 5th instars than for adults, and was higher for cells with higher initial densities (not lower than 3indm−2). The modeled results showed that the main factors influencing grasshopper density differed for different instars. During the 2nd and 3rd instar, grasshopper density depended on the number of hatched nymphs and their mortality. During the 4th instar, habitat suitability determined the density threshold that caused grasshoppers to disperse and the potential sink or source cells. This resulted in different density variations between the cells with initial densities >6.0indm−2 and those with densities <6.0indm−2. During and after the 5th instar, grasshopper density was very stable due to the slightly decreasing habitat suitability. The modeled results are expected to provide a scientific basis for predicting grasshopper dynamics and controlling grasshopper plagues in heterogeneous spaces.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOedaleus 3aadults 3abiomass 3acase studies 3acattle 3agrasses 3agrasshoppers 3ahabitats 3ahatching 3ainstars 3alandscapes 3amodels 3amortality 3anymphs 3apopulation dynamics 3aprediction 3asteppes 3atemporal variation 3aChina 0aOedaleus decorus asiaticus 0aGrasshopper density 0aDispersal 0aAboveground biomass 0aGrasshopper–plant interaction 0aSpatial heterogeneity1 aJing, Yong-Cai1 aLiu, Zhengyu,1 aLi, Yao1 aShen, Jing0 tEcological modelling.g2016 June 10, v. 329 p.5-17dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl6191x0304-38007nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2016.03.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02737naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100006000147245013700207300001800344520145200362592002801814650001401842650001401856650001801870650002401888650001501912650002101927650002001948650001101968650002601979650000902005650002302014650002402037650001302061700002502074700002502099773012502124856008102249852000902330655001202339IND60601072720221119191715.0180705e201808  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060107272DNAL7 a10.1007/s12649-017-9860-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPaintsil, Arnold1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5124-360910aAssessment of the Transesterification Stage of Biodiesel Production II: Optimisation of Process Variables Using a Box-Behnken Design  ap. 1399-1405.  aRenewable energy policies, in tandem with favourable market conditions, have culminated in large increases in biodiesel use globally. With increasing volumes of biodiesel and a broader range of suitable feedstocks, including used oils, stabilisation is becoming ever more important. The quality of biodiesel depends on the feedstock, purity of the milled oils, the storage conditions and the transesterification process. In this study, process variables in transesterification were optimised using a Box-Behnken design. The results of linear and non-linear (quadratic) functions and interaction terms (catalyst-FFA (Free fatty acid), stirring-catalyst, FFA-stirring pairs) indicate complex relationships between the set of factors and biodiesel yield. At the 95% significance level, all the linear terms were statistically significant unlike the quadratic term in which only the catalyst was significant. Furthermore, the joint effects of the FFA*Catalyst and the Stir*Catalyst interaction terms were statistically significant whereas the interaction between stirring and FFA had no influence on the yield of biodiesel. The yield distributions for varying combinations of the factors show that the optimum factor combinations for a percentage yield greater than 98% is low (−1/0.5 g) FFA, low (−1/400 rpm) stirring rate and high catalyst amount (1/4 g). Overall, the multivariate model accounted for 86.4% of the total variance in the data.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiodiesel 3acatalysts 3aenergy policy 3aexperimental design 3afeedstocks 3afree fatty acids 3afuel production 3amixing 3amultivariate analysis 3aoils 3astorage conditions 3atransesterification 3avariance1 aArmah, Frederick Ato1 aYanful, Ernest Kwesi0 tWaste and biomass valorization.g2018 Aug., v. 9, no. 8 p.1399-1405dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:6304x1877-26417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12649-017-9860-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01911naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001800146245014400164300001600308520058900324592002800913650002900941650001600970650002000986650001101006650001301017650002701030650003001057650000801087650001001095653002301105653003001128653002201158653003101180653003301211653001701244700002201261773012701283856008201410852000901492655001201501IND60478498620221119154038.0160121e20091201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6047849862DNAL7 a10.1556/AAgr.57.2009.4.32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchneider, A.10aDetection of the 1RS chromosome arm in Martonvásár wheat genotypes containing 1Bl.1Rs or 1Al.1Rs translocations using SSR and STS markers  ap. 409-416.  aSeveral molecular markers have been reported for the detection of the 1RS chromosome arm.

In this report water-soluble silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) were prepared facilely by chemical reduction of Ag(I) ions. 4-Amino-3-(d-gluco-pentitol-1-yl)-4,5-dihydro-1,2,4-triazole-5-thione (AGTT) was used both as reducing and stabilizing agent. Direct heating methodology was found to be more suitable for achieving particles with a hydrodynamic diameter of ∼20nm. AGTT exists as tautomer in solution form and our studies indicate that –NH₂ group is involved in the reduction and stabilization of Ag⁺ and thione (Δ=S) group of AGTT is possibly involved in stabilizing the nanoparticles via coordinate covalent linkage. Characterization of synthesized silver nanoparticles was performed by UV–vis, FT-IR and by FESEM. Based on the absorption properties of synthesized AgNPs, we used AgNPs to detect bovine serum albumin (BSA) and AgNPs-BSA composite nanoprobe was further applied to detect Cu²⁺ based on absorbance recovery. The proposed method has advantages over existing methods in terms of rapid synthesis and stability of AgNPs and their applications. Analysis is reproducible, cost effective and highly sensitive. The lowest detectable concentration of BSA in this approach is 3nM, and for Cu²⁺ it can detect upto 200pM.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aabsorbance 3abiosensors 3abovine serum albumin 3achemical reduction 3acopper 3acost effectiveness 3aheat 3ahydrodynamics 3aions 3ananoparticles 3ananosilver 3areducing agents 3asilver1 aIqbal, Mahwish1 aEl Ashry, El Sayed H.1 aKanwal, Shamsa0 tBiosensors & bioelectronics.g2012 , v. 36, no. 1 p.236-241dElsevier B.V.x0956-56637nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bios.2012.04.0253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02891naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006700148245008600215300001200301520163400313592002801947650001301975650002201988650002302010650001102033650001702044650002002061650001602081650002302097650001802120651001702138700002402155700002002179700001602199700001802215700001702233773015102250856008302401852000902484655001202493IND60769032720221122141554.0220513e202203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076903272DNAL7 a10.1007/s10661-022-09874-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSharif, Muhammad Nadeem1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5700-429710aStaged energy and water quality optimization for large water distribution systems  ap. 232.  aSimultaneous optimization of energy and water quality in real-time large-sized water distribution systems is a daunting task for water suppliers. The complexity of energy optimization increases with a large number of pipes, scheduling of several pumps, and adjustments of tanks’ water levels. Most of the simultaneous energy and water quality optimization approaches evaluate small (or hypothetical) networks or compromise water quality. In the proposed staged approach, Stage 1 uses a risk-based approach to optimally locate the chlorine boosters in a large distribution system based on residual chlorine failures and the associated consequences in different land uses of the service area. Integrating EPANET and CPLEX software, Stage 2 uses mixed integer goal programming for optimizing the day-ahead pump scheduling. The objective function minimizes the pumping energy cost as well as the undesirable deviations from goal constraints, such as expected water demand. Stage 3 evaluates the combined hydraulics and water quality performances at the network level. The implementation of the proposed approach on a real-time large-sized network of Al-Khobar City in Saudi Arabia, with 44 groundwater wells, 12 reservoirs, 2 storage tanks, 191 mains, 141 junctions, and 17 pumps, illustrated the practicality of the framework. Simulating the network with an optimal pumping schedule and chlorine boosters’ locations shows a 40% improvement in water quality performance, desired hydraulics performance with optimal pump scheduling, and an average 20% energy cost reduction compared to the normal (unoptimized) base case scenario.  aPublisher supplied data 3achlorine 3acomputer software 3acost effectiveness 3aenergy 3aenergy costs 3afluid mechanics 3agroundwater 3awater distribution 3awater quality 3aSaudi Arabia1 aBakhtavar, Ezzeddin1 aHaider, Husnain1 aHu, Guangji1 aHewage, Kasun1 aSadiq, Rehan0 tEnvironmental monitoring and assessment.g2022 Mar., v. 194, no. 3 p.232-232dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:jnl33242x0167-63697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-022-09874-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03071naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002600150245015700176520155100333592002801884650001901912650001301931650001801944650001901962650001501981650001601996650001802012650001202030650004102042650002902083650001402112650001502126650001302141653002002154653003002174653003602204653002202240653001602262700002102278700002202299700001502321700005702336773011402393856008502507852000902592655001202601IND60750811620221120040347.0211023e20211025xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075081162DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chroma.2021.4625552doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMaciel, Larissa Silva10aDerivatization-targeted analysis of amino compounds in plant extracts in neutral loss acquisition mode by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry  aAmino compounds, such as amino acids and biogenic amines, are important metabolites that can be found in diverse natural matrices. The most common method for amino compound analysis nowadays is reversed-phase liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (RPLC-MS/MS). However, due to the polar and the basic nature of amines, their RPLC retention is often insufficient or peaks are tailing. Derivatization is a way to overcome the issue and in the present work amino compounds are derivatized with diethyl ethoxymethylenemalonate (DEEMM) and analyzed by a RPLC triple quadrupole MS system in neutral loss scan (NLS) mode (loss of 46). This allows to target all compounds in the sample that undergo derivatization with DEEMM, so that the amino compound profile of the sample is obtained. To the best of our knowledge, the NLS acquisition mode has never been employed to target amino compounds after DEEMM derivatization. In the first part of the study, eight amino acids (arginine, aspartic acid, threonine, proline, tyrosine, tryptophan, phenylalanine and isoleucine) were employed as model compounds for method optimization, with good results in terms of DEEMM derivatives detection and repeatability. The developed method was successfully applied to a complex extract from the plant species Carduus nutans subsp. macrocephalus (Desf.) Nyman, with 18 amino acids and 3 other amines being identified. The proposed approach could be employed for straightforward identification of known and unknown amino compounds in different types of matrices.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCarduus nutans 3aarginine 3aaspartic acid 3aderivatization 3aisoleucine 3ametabolites 3aphenylalanine 3aproline 3areversed-phase liquid chromatography 3atandem mass spectrometry 3athreonine 3atryptophan 3atyrosine 0aAmino compounds 0aPre-column derivatization 0aDiethyl ethoxymethylenemalonate 0aNeutral loss scan 0aCarduus spp1 aMarengo, Arianna1 aRubiolo, Patrizia1 aLeito, Ivo1 aHerodes, Koit1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1763-17840 tJournal of chromatography.g2021 Oct. 25, v. 1656 p.462555-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl50504x0021-96737nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chroma.2021.4625553Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03584naa a2200709 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024003800135040001800173100001200191245011800203300001600321506007600337520131900413592002801732506003701760650002101797650001101818650001101829650003101840650002201871650001701893650002001910650001601930650002001946650002901966650002901995650004102024650000902065650002502074650002702099650002302126650002202149650001102171650003402182650002302216650002202239650006402261650003102325650004802356650002902404651001102433651001102444653001502455653002502470653005202495653001502547653001702562653002002579700002202599700001602621700001502637700001702652700002002669773011302689856005102802852000902853655001202862IND50087200720221207082859.0140412e20110601xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5008720072DNAL7 a216234992pmid7 aPMC31185202pmcid7 a10.1080/19440049.2010.5047502doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTam, J.10aApplication of isotope dilution mass spectrometry: determination of ochratoxin A in the Canadian Total Diet Study  ap. 754-761.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aAnalytical methods are generally developed and optimized for specific commodities. Total Diet Studies, representing typical food products ‘as consumed’, pose an analytical challenge since every food product is different. In order to address this technical challenge, a selective and sensitive analytical method was developed suitable for the quantitation of ochratoxin A (OTA) in Canadian Total Diet Study composites. The method uses an acidified solvent extraction, an immunoaffinity column (IAC) for clean-up, liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) for identification and quantification, and a uniformly stable isotope-labelled OTA (U-[¹³C₂₀]-OTA) as an internal recovery standard. Results are corrected for this standard. The method is accurate (101% average recovery) and precise (5.5% relative standard deviation (RSD)) based on 17 duplicate analysis of various food products over 2 years. A total of 140 diet composites were analysed for OTA as part of the Canadian Total Diet Study. Samples were collected at retail level from two Canadian cities, Quebec City and Calgary, in 2008 and 2009, respectively. The results indicate that 73% (102/140) of the samples had detectable levels of OTA, with some of the highest levels of OTA contamination found in the Canadian bread supply.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aTotal Diet Study 3abreads 3acities 3aisotope dilution technique 3amass spectrometry 3aochratoxin A 2aBreadxanalysis 2aCalibration 2aCarbon Isotopes 2aEdible Grainxchemistry. 2aChromatography, Affinity 2aChromatography, High Pressure Liquid 2aDiet 2aFast Foodsxanalysis 2aFood Analysisxmethods 2aFood Contamination 2aFeeding Behavior. 2aHumans 2aIndicator Dilution Techniques 2aLimit of Detection 2aNutrition Surveys 2aOchratoxinsxanalysisxchemistryxisolation & purification. 2aReproducibility of Results 2aSpectrometry, Mass, Electrospray Ionization 2aTandem Mass Spectrometry 3aQuebec 0aCanada 0atotal diet 0amarket basket survey 0aliquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC/MS) 0amycotoxins 0aochratoxin A 0aprocessed foods1 aPantazopoulos, P.1 aScott, P.M.1 aMoisey, J.1 aDabeka, R.W.1 aRichard, I.D.K.0 tFood additives & contaminants.g2011 June 1, v. 28, no. 6 p.754-761dTaylor & Francis Groupx1944-00577nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/19440049.2010.504750  aDNAL 7aarticle02836naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006000148245015300208300002000361500001900381520134000400592002801740596006601768596006301834650001801897650002501915650002901940650002601969650003201995650001302027650001202040651001902052651001102071700002402082700001502106700002402121700001902145773017002164856008302334852000902417655001202426IND60706987220221118041909.0200819e202009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070698722DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-020-09466-w2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMotyka, Oldřich1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9644-061110aMoss biomonitoring and air pollution modelling on a regional scale: delayed reflection of industrial pollution in moss in a heavily polluted region?  ap. 32569-32578.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aA passive biomonitoring survey using terrestrial mosses was performed in a heavily polluted industrial region on the border between Czechia and Poland in a regular grid of 41 sampling points. The concentrations of 38 elements were determined in the moss samples, using Neutron Activation Analysis (NAA). Simultaneously, air pollution modelling was performed using the Czech reference methodology Symos’97 for the year of the sampling (2015) and 3 years prior (2012) in order to compare the results of both the approaches and evaluate the credibility of the moss biomonitoring method. The NAA results were transformed according to the principles of compositional data analysis and assessed using hierarchical clustering on principal components. The resulting clusters were compared with the results of air pollution modelling using one-way analysis of variance. The association of determined clusters with the pollution from industrial sources was confirmed only for the results of the 2012 modelling. This validates the complementarity of the air pollution modelling and the moss biomonitoring, ascertains the moss biomonitoring as a valid method for long-term pollution assessment and confirms one of the fundamentals of moss biomonitoring, the reflection of the atmospheric conditions prevailing in the period before the sampling.  aPublisher supplied data  aSP2019/70cMinisterstvo Školství, Mládeže a Tělovýchovy  aLO1404cMinisterstvo Školství, Mládeže a Tělovýchovy 3aair pollution 3aanalysis of variance 3aenvironmental monitoring 3amosses and liverworts 3aneutron activation analysis 3aresearch 3asurveys 3aCzech Republic 3aPoland1 aPavlíková, Irena,1 aBitta, Jan1 aFrontasyeva, Marina1 aJančík, Petr0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research international.g2020 Sept., v. 27, no. 26 p.32569-32578dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl4122550x0944-13447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-020-09466-w3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02635naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092040001800130100004200148245010200190300001800292500001900310520134700329592002801676650002001704650001601724650001101740650002301751650001501774650001901789650002101808650001301829650001901842650002201861700002101883700002001904700002101924700002101945700002001966700001901986773011502005856008402120852000902204655001202213IND6036860120221117163036.0141112e201112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND603686012DNAL7 a10.1016/j.plaphy.2011.09.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKim, Yun-Heec(Marketing researcher),10aSCOF-1-expressing transgenic sweetpotato plants show enhanced tolerance to low-temperature stress  ap. 1436-1441.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aLow-temperature stress represents one of the principal limitations affecting the distribution and productivity of many plant species, including crops such as sweetpotato. Transgenic sweetpotato (Ipomoea batatas L. cv. Yulmi) plants expressing the soybean cold-inducible zinc finger protein (SCOF-1) under control of an oxidative stress-inducible peroxidase (SWPA2) promoter (referred to as SF plants), were developed and evaluated for enhanced tolerance to low-temperature conditions. Following 4 °C treatment of SF plants, SCOF-1 expression correlated positively with tolerance to low-temperature stress at the leaf disc level. Increased SCOF-1 expression also correlated with enhanced tolerance to different low-temperature treatments at the whole plant level. SF plants treated with low-temperature stress (4 or 10 °C for 30 h) exhibited less of a reduction in photosynthetic activity and lipid peroxidation levels than non-transgenic (NT) plants. Furthermore, the photosynthetic activity and lipid peroxidation levels of SF plants recovered to near pre-stress levels after 12 h of recovery at 25 °C. In contrast, these activities remained at a reduced level in NT plants after the same recovery period. Thus, this study has shown that low-temperature stress in sweetpotato can be efficiently modulated by overexpression of SCOF-1.  aPublisher supplied data 3aIpomoea batatas 3acold stress 3aleaves 3alipid peroxidation 3aperoxidase 3aphotosynthesis 3aplant physiology 3asoybeans 3asweet potatoes 3azinc finger motif1 aKim, Myoung Duck1 aPark, Sung-Chul1 aYang, Kyoung-Sil1 aJeong, Jae Cheol1 aLee, Haeng-Soon1 aKwak, Sang-Soo0 tPlant physiology and biochemistry.g2011 Dec., v. 49, no. 12 p.1436-1441dElsevier Masson SASx0981-94287nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.plaphy.2011.09.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02756naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100006300147245012000210300001800330520118400348592002801532596003701560650002201597650002401619650002201643650001201665650001301677650002701690650001401717650001101731650003701742650001901779650002601798650000901824650001401833650001901847650001401866650001801880650001701898650002301915650003801938700002201976700002301998700002602021773012502047856008102172852000902253655001202262IND60601073220221119191850.0180705e201808  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060107322DNAL7 a10.1007/s12649-017-9891-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAdeogun, Abideen I.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2587-926110aFacile Development of Nano Size Calcium Hydroxyapatite Based Ceramic from Eggshells: Synthesis and Characterization  ap. 1469-1473.  aAgriculture is encouraged throughout the world for sufficient production of food and agro allied raw materials. However, a lot of solid wastes are generated which required added value so that their handling will not become impediments to agricultural production itself. One of such waste is egg shell, which can be transformed into hydroxyapatite with immense use in biological, environmental, tissue engineering and biological applications. In this study hydroxyapatite (HAp) was successfully synthesized from recycled uncalcined eggshells waste via wet chemical precipitation method. The microstructure of the developed HAp was characterized by X-ray diffraction, energy dispersed spectroscopy, transmission electron microscope and Fourier infrared spectroscopy. The presence of trace elements such as K, Mg and Fe were detected by EDAX measurement. The as prepared and calcinated products consist of B-type carbonated HAp nano-rods with Ca/P molar ratio was estimated to be 1.95 and can be a potential candidate for biomedical applications. Thus, agricultural waste of eggshells is veritable source materials for the production of important biomaterial such as hydroxyapatite.  aPublisher supplied data  aFR number: 3240275035cTWAS_CSIR 3aX-ray diffraction 3aagricultural wastes 3abiobased products 3acalcium 3aceramics 3achemical precipitation 3aegg shell 3aenergy 3aenergy-dispersive X-ray analysis 3ahydroxyapatite 3ainfrared spectroscopy 3airon 3amagnesium 3amicrostructure 3apotassium 3araw materials 3asolid wastes 3atissue engineering 3atransmission electron microscopes1 aOfudje, Andrew E.1 aIdowu, Mopelola A.1 aKareem, Sarafadeen O.0 tWaste and biomass valorization.g2018 Aug., v. 9, no. 8 p.1469-1473dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:6304x1877-26417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12649-017-9891-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04341naa a2200925 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024003800135040001800173100001500191245014800206300001600354506007600370520160600446592002802052506003702080650002102117650001102138650001002149650001602159650001602175650001102191650001602202650001202218650001302230650000902243650002002252650001502272650001602287650002002303650001202323650000902335650002102344650001902365650000902384650001002393650001102403650001502414650001002429650000902439650001202448650002502460650001002485650001202495650002302507650000902530650001702539650008702556650003702643650001102680650005202691650004202743650001102785650001102796650003802807650002202845650000902867650007402876651001102950651001102961651001102972653001502983653002802998653004903026653003503075700002003110700001703130700001803147700001603165700001703181700001703198700001503215773011303230856005103343852000903394655001203403IND50087201120221207083215.0140412e20110601xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5008720112DNAL7 a216235042pmid7 aPMC31185302pmcid7 a10.1080/19440049.2010.5130152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCao, X.-L.10aConcentrations of bisphenol A in the composite food samples from the 2008 Canadian total diet study in Quebec City and dietary intake estimates  ap. 791-798.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aA total of 154 food composite samples from the 2008 total diet study in Quebec City were analysed for bisphenol A (BPA), and BPA was detected in less than half (36%, or 55 samples) of the samples tested. High concentrations of BPA were found mostly in the composite samples containing canned foods, with the highest BPA level being observed in canned fish (106 ng g⁻¹), followed by canned corn (83.7 ng g⁻¹), canned soups (22.2–44.4 ng g⁻¹), canned baked beans (23.5 ng g⁻¹), canned peas (16.8 ng g⁻¹), canned evaporated milk (15.3 ng g⁻¹), and canned luncheon meats (10.5 ng g⁻¹). BPA levels in baby food composite samples were low, with 2.75 ng g⁻¹ in canned liquid infant formula, and 0.84–2.46 ng g⁻¹ in jarred baby foods. BPA was also detected in some foods that are not canned or in jars, such as yeast (8.52 ng g⁻¹), baking powder (0.64 ng g⁻¹), some cheeses (0.68–2.24 ng g⁻¹), breads and some cereals (0.40–1.73 ng g⁻¹), and fast foods (1.1–10.9 ng g⁻¹). Dietary intakes of BPA were low for all age–sex groups, with 0.17–0.33 µg kg⁻¹ body weight day⁻¹ for infants, 0.082–0.23 µg kg⁻¹ body weight day⁻¹ for children aged from 1 to 19 years, and 0.052–0.081 µg kg⁻¹ body weight day⁻¹ for adults, well below the established regulatory limits. BPA intakes from 19 of the 55 samples account for more than 95% of the total dietary intakes, and most of the 19 samples were either canned or in jars. Intakes of BPA from non-canned foods are low.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aTotal Diet Study 3aadults 3abeans 3abisphenol A 3abody weight 3abreads 3acanned fish 3acheeses 3achildren 3acorn 3aevaporated milk 3afast foods 3afood intake 3ainfant formulas 3ainfants 3ajars 3aleavening agents 3aluncheon meats 3apeas 3asoups 3ayeasts 2aAdolescent 2aAdult 2aAged 2aAnimals 2aBenzhydryl Compounds 2aChild 2aCooking 2aDatabases, Factual 2aDiet 2aDiet Surveys 2aEndocrine Disruptorsxadministration & dosagexanalysisxisolation & purification. 2aFast Foodsxanalysisxstandards. 2aFemale 2aFood Contaminationxstatistics & numerical data 2aFood, Preservedxanalysisxstandards. 2aHumans 2aInfant 2aInfant Foodxanalysisxstandards. 2aLegislation, Food 2aMale 2aPhenolsxadministration & dosagexanalysisxisolation & purification. 3aQuebec 0aCanada 0aQuebec 0atotal diet 0agas chromatography (GC) 0agas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) 0atotal diet studies bisphenol A1 aPerez-Locas, C.1 aDufresne, G.1 aClément, G.,1 aPopovic, S.1 aBeraldin, F.1 aDabeka, R.W.1 aFeeley, M.0 tFood additives & contaminants.g2011 June 1, v. 28, no. 6 p.791-798dTaylor & Francis Groupx1944-00577nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/19440049.2010.513015  aDNAL 7aarticle02612naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002700113040001800140100001500158245009500173300001600268520151500284592002801799650002001827650001401847650002201861650001101883650001701894650001101911650001501922650000901937650001301946650002301959651001801982700001602000700001702016700001202033700001402045773009402059856004002153852000902193655001202202IND50088883120221116144031.0140418e201405  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5008888312DNAL7 a235518692pmid7 a10.1111/zph.120472doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEdison, L.10aAssessment of Human Exposures to Animal Vaccines Using Poison Control Records, 2000–2009  ap. 175-180.  aTo characterize human exposures to vaccines intended for animals, evaluate the human risk due to these exposures and determine whether there is sufficient surveillance in place to monitor them. Retrospective analysis of surveillance data (2000–2009). Information collected by poison specialists during calls reporting human exposure to an animal vaccine product, made to one of the 57 United States Poison Control Centers. Data from the National Poison Data System were analysed to determine the number of calls due to human exposures to animal vaccines, and descriptive statistics were generated to characterize the exposures by age, gender, medical outcome, exposure site, exposure route, vaccine type and intended species, aetiologic agent, call date and exposure reason. Overall, the human health effects were minor, primarily due to unintentional parenteral exposure. Less than 15% of the reports were classified as occupational, and 80% of the exposures took place outside of a workplace or healthcare facility. Almost 60% of calls were due to exposure to the West Nile Virus vaccine; the others distributed among a variety of vaccines. Unintentional exposure to animal vaccines appears to occur almost exclusively among untrained individuals who may benefit from more effective education about the risks and benefits of administering vaccines. Improved reporting of adverse outcomes is essential to adequately define the extent of human exposure and risks associated with availability of new vaccines.  aPublisher supplied data 3aWest Nile virus 3aeducation 3aexposure pathways 3agender 3ahuman health 3ahumans 3amonitoring 3arisk 3avaccines 3aworking conditions 3aUnited States1 aSchulte, J.1 aSchauben, J.1 aKay, R.1 aRubin, C.0 tZoonoses and public health.g2014 May, v. 61, no. 3 p.175-180dBlackwellx1863-19597nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/zph.12047  aDNAL 7aarticle02639naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001400146245015900160300001600319500001500335520102500350592002801375650001901403650001501422650001301437650001501450650001701465650001101482650003601493650001301529650002501542650002801567650002801595650001401623650001601637650000901653650001901662650001601681650002001697650002001717650001101737653001001748653002301758653002501781653001701806653002401823700001501847700001701862773012701879856008202006852000902088655001202097IND60478499120221119153859.0160121e20091201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6047849912DNAL7 a10.1556/AAgr.57.2009.4.82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKósa, E.10aRelationship between S-methylmethionine treatment and the activities of antioxidant enzymes in maize ( <i>Zea mays</i> L.) leaves at chilling temperatures  ap. 461-469.  a2019-12-06  aS-methylmethionine (SMM) is an important intermediary compound in the sulphur metabolism and has been shown to play a possible role in moderating the damaging effects of low temperature stress. The present work investigated the extent to which SMM is capable of influencing the activity of antioxidant enzymes when the subtropical species maize is exposed to chilling temperatures during the early developmental phase. SMM was found to contribute to the protection of maize seedlings against low (<14°C) temperature stress by enhancing the activity of certain antioxidant enzymes to varying extents, and thus helping to neutralise the reactive oxygen species (ROS) formed at this temperature. Results obtained in a gradient plant growth chamber revealed that, with the exception of catalase, SMM increased the activity of all the antioxidants studied (glutathione reductase, glutathione-S-transferase, guaiacol peroxidase, ascorbate peroxidase), particularly in the lower ranges of the temperature gradient (6–14°C).  aPublisher supplied data 3aneutralization 3aperoxidase 3aZea mays 3ametabolism 3aplant growth 3asulfur 3aglutathione-disulfide reductase 3acatalase 3aascorbate peroxidase 3aglutathione transferase 3areactive oxygen species 3aseedlings 3acold stress 3acorn 3acold treatment 3atemperature 3aenzyme activity 3agrowth chambers 3aleaves 0amaize 0aS-methylmethionine 0achilling temperature 0aantioxidants 0aantioxidant enzymes1 aSzegő, D.1 aHorváth, E.0 tActa agronomica Academiae Scientiarum Hungaricae.g2009 Dec. 1, v. 57, no. 4 p.461-469dAkadémiai Kiadóx0238-01617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1556%2FAAgr.57.2009.4.83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03373naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004300111040001800154100002300172245010100195300001600296520169400312592002802006650001802034650002102052650004302073650001702116650001002133650002702143650001702170650001502187650001002202650001302212650001502225650001302240650003302253650001202286650002202298650003302320650002902353650004102382650001102423650003002434650002202464650000902486651001002495651001002505700002002515700001302535700002002548700002502568700002102593773008302614856008902697852000902786655001202795IND4466415120221120055211.0141110e201104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446641512DNAL7 a211907172pmid7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2010.12.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGuruge, Keerthi S.10aFluorinated alkyl compounds including long chain carboxylic acids in wild bird livers from Japan  ap. 379-384.  aA wide range of fluorinated alkyl compounds (FACs) has been reported in wildlife in various locations in the world. However, such information regarding Japanese wildlife is rarely found. In the present study, we investigated the occurrence of 21 FACs, including perfluorinated alkyl sulfonates (PFASs), perfluorinated carboxylates (PFCAs), and fluorotelomer acids, in the livers of 10 wild bird species from two regions in northern Japan. To avoid interferences, FACs were quantified by a recently developed method using acetonitrile and solid-phase extraction followed by an ion exchange HPLC column separation. Apart from perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS), which was found at the highest levels of all the compounds detected, several long chain perfluorinated carboxylates (PFCAs) from C8 to C16, particularly perfluorotetradecanoic acid (PFTeDA) and perfluorohexadecanoic acid (PFHxDA), were detected for the first time. Additionally, 7:3 FTCA, a fluorotelomer acid, was also detected in most swan livers from Miyagi prefecture and all the birds from Tochigi prefecture. However, none of the sulfonamides and unsaturated telomer acids were detected in any species. Swans seem to be the least exposed wild birds to FACs among the investigated birds, signifying that feeding habits may reflect FAC accumulation in wild birds. The highest total concentration of detected FACs was 405ngg⁻¹wet wt., which was found in a Japanese sparrowhawk, indicating that the top predatory wild birds can accumulate several long chain carboxylic acids. However, the current FAC concentrations found in livers may suggest that these compounds alone would not cause a severe toxic effect in these species.  aPublisher supplied data 3abirds of prey 3acarboxylic acids 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3aion exchange 3aliver 3asolid phase extraction 3asulfonamides 3asulfonates 3aswans 3atoxicity 3awild birds 3awildlife 2aAlkanesulfonatesxmetabolism 2aAnimals 2aBirdsxmetabolism 2aCarboxylic Acidsxmetabolism 2aEnvironmental Monitoring 2aEnvironmental Pollutantsxmetabolism 2aFemale 2aFluorocarbonsxmetabolism 2aLiverxmetabolism 2aMale 3aJapan 0aJapan1 aYeung, Leo W.Y.1 aLi, Peng1 aTaniyasu, Sachi1 aYamashita, Nobuyoshi1 aNakamura, Mayumi0 tChemosphere.g2011 Apr., v. 83, no. 3 p.379-384dElsevier Ltdx0045-65357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2010.12.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03985naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100006100138245011900199300001800318500001100336520179200347592002802139650003102167650001102198650002402209650001802233650001402251650002002265650001702285650001702302650002402319650001702343650002102360650001702381650001302398650002502411650001402436650001702450650001202467700005902479700005802538700006002596700005902656700005902715700006202774700006102836700006202897700005802959700005803017700006403075700006203139773012503201856007203326852000903398655001203407IND60751359720221121072621.0210924e202109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075135972DNAL7 a10.1002/ptr.71382doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMarahatha, Rishab1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9065-159X10aPharmacologic activities of phytosteroids in inflammatory diseases: Mechanism of action and therapeutic potentials  ap. 5103-5124.  aREVIEW  aNatural products and their derivatives are known to be useful for treating numerous diseases since ancient times. Because of their high therapeutic potentials, the use of different medicinal plants is possible to treat varied inflammation‐mediated chronic diseases. Among natural products, phytosteroids have emerged as promising compounds mostly because they have diverse pharmacological activities. Currently, available medications exert numerous systemic toxicities, including hypertension, immune suppression, osteoporosis, and metabolic abnormalities. Thus, further research on phytosteroids to subside these complications is of significant importance. In this study, the information on phytosteroids, their types, and actions against inflammation, and allergic complications was collected by a systematic survey of literature on several scientific search engines. The literature review suggested that phytosteroids exhibit antiinflammatory action via different modes through transrepression or selective COX‐2 enzymes. Also, in silico ADMET analysis was carried out on available phytosteroids to uncover their pharmacokinetic properties. Our analysis has shown that eight compounds: withaferin A, stigmasterol, β‐sitosterol, guggulsterone, diosgenin, sarsasapogenin, physalin A, and dioscin, −isolated from medicinal plants show similar pharmacokinetic properties as compared to dexamethasone, commercially available glucocorticoid. These phytosteroids could be useful for the treatment of inflammatory diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel diseases, multiple sclerosis, asthma, and cardiovascular diseases. Thus, systematic research is required to explore potent phytosteroids with lesser side effects, which might substitute the current medications.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanti-inflammatory activity 3aasthma 3acomputer simulation 3adexamethasone 3adiosgenin 3aglucocorticoids 3ahypertension 3ainflammation 3amechanism of action 3aosteoporosis 3apharmacokinetics 3aphytotherapy 3aresearch 3arheumatoid arthritis 3asclerosis 3astigmasterol 3asurveys1 aGyawali, Kabita1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7562-80521 aSharma, Kabita1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7154-43341 aGyawali, Narayan1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7810-72601 aTandan, Parbati1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1495-10451 aAdhikari, Ashma1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6288-07931 aTimilsina, Grishma1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2201-86771 aBhattarai, Salyan1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6553-02861 aLamichhane, Ganesh1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4352-74571 aAcharya, Ashis1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9369-72191 aPathak, Ishwor1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8129-405X1 aDevkota, Hari Prasad1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0509-16211 aParajuli, Niranjan1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9233-64890 tPhytotherapy research.g2021 Sept., v. 35, no. 9 p.5103-5124dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.wJournal:jnl47440x0951-418X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ptr.71383Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03143naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100003000147245010100177300001200278520176300290592002802053596003402081650002502115650002502140650002402165650002102189650002502210650002002235650001202255650001302267650002102280650002202301650001802323650002002341650001002361650001302371651001302384700002502397700002402422700002602446773013502472856008102607852000902688655001202697IND60601073620221119191916.0180705e201807  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060107362DNAL7 a10.1007/s12665-018-7636-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRozainah, Mohamad Zakaria10aStand structure and biomass estimation in the Klang Islands Mangrove Forest, Peninsular Malaysia  ap. 486.  aA study was carried out at three sites in the Klang Islands Mangrove Forest Reserve, in Selangor, Malaysia, to obtain baseline information on how land use could affect forest community metrics. The objective was to obtain baseline ecological data that would allow assessment of different land-use types (industrial, village, and pristine mangrove forests) on species composition, stand density, diversity, similarity, important value index, and biomass. Undisturbed pristine mangrove forest was sampled at Pulau Klang, while disturbed mangrove forests were sampled at Teluk Gong and Pulau Ketam. A total of 14 species from five families were counted across the three sites, with the highest tree density found at Pulau Ketam (2034 trees ha⁻¹), followed by Pulau Klang and Teluk Gong (1627 and 753 trees ha⁻¹, respectively). The dominant species on Pulau Klang and Pulau Ketam was Rhizophora apiculata (importance value index, IVI = 181.4). Shannon–Weaver diversity was highest at Pulau Ketam (H′ = 1.81) and the tree species on that island were also the most evenly distributed (Pielou evenness index, J′ = 0.87). The highest above-ground and below-ground biomass values for a single species were recorded at Pulau Klang for R. apiculata (80.51 and 41.63 t ha⁻¹, respectively), while the second highest values were at Teluk Gong for Rhizophora mucronata (71.33 and 27.07 t ha⁻¹, respectively). As a whole, however, the remaining large trees in a disturbed site in Teluk Gong contributed to the highest total biomass (220.64 t ha⁻¹) followed by Pulau Klang and Pulau Ketam (192.22 and 161.93 t ha⁻¹, respectively). Proper assessment and management of these valuable mangrove forests are crucial to ensure mangrove ecosystem health.  aPublisher supplied data  aRP019D-SUScUniversiti Malaya 3aRhizophora apiculata 3aRhizophora mucronata 3abelowground biomass 3adominant species 3aenvironmental health 3aforest reserves 3aislands 3aland use 3amangrove forests 3aspecies diversity 3astand density 3astand structure 3atrees 3avillages 3aMalaysia1 aSofawi, Ahmad Bakrin1 aJoharee, Nur Adibah1 aPauzi, Ahmad Zulkifli0 tEnvironmental earth sciences.g2018 July, v. 77, no. 13 p.486-486dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:J000001228x1866-62807nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12665-018-7636-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02361naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245012000165300001400285520123700299592002801536650001801564650001101582650001501593650001601608650001401624650001301638650001401651650003001665651001201695653000901707653001601716653002501732653001501757653001701772773009401789856008301883852000901966655001201975IND60479385820221123034623.0160121e20110601xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6047938582DNAL7 a10.1556/ComEc.12.2011.1.72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLőrinczi, G.10aDensity and spatial pattern of nests in sub-Mediterranean ground-dwelling ant communities (Hymenoptera: Formicidae)  ap. 51-57.  aThe density and spatial pattern of ant nests were examined in two sub-Mediterranean habitats of the Balaton Uplands in Hungary. The aim of this study was to examine whether regular spatial arrangement, the most common dispersion pattern among ants that mostly indicates competition, is a characteristic feature of these communities. In both habitats, the nests of <i>Aphaenogaster subterranea</i> and <i>Lasius emarginatus</i> had the highest density, followed by the nests of <i>Prenolepis nitens</i> and <i>Temnothorax crassispinus</i>, which were also frequent. The intraspecific spacing pattern of nests was random or aggregated in most cases, and when the species identity of the nearest neighbour was disregarded, the nests of all the individual species showed significant aggregation. The nearest interspecific inter-nest distances proved to be significantly shorter than the nearest intraspecific inter-nest distances both in the case of the entire community and the majority of individual species, except for the polydomous <i>L. emarginatus.</i> On the basis of the results it seems that neither intra-, nor interspecific competition may be an important process in the formation of nest spacing patterns in these habitats.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAphaenogaster 3aLasius 3aPrenolepis 3aTemnothorax 3aant nests 3ahabitats 3ahighlands 3ainterspecific competition 3aHungary 0aAnts 0aCompetition 0aDistribution pattern 0aFormicidae 0aNest density0 tCommunity ecology.g2011 June 1, v. 12, no. 1 p.51-57dAkadémiai Kiadóx1585-85537nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1556%2FComEc.12.2011.1.73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03078naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100005500140245015800195300001600353500002000369520147800389592002801867596005901895596002201954596006501976596005602041650002302097650002002120650001402140650002102154650001102175650002302186650002802209650001302237651001102250700006802261700007102329700006202400773011002462856007502572852000902647655001202656IND60782234520221123030759.0220706e202206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078223452DNAL7 a10.1111/biom.134232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSauer, Sara1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6754-418210aSmall‐sample inference for cluster‐based outcome‐dependent sampling schemes in resource‐limited settings: Investigating low birthweight in Rwanda  ap. 701-715.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe neonatal mortality rate in Rwanda remains above the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 3 target of 12 deaths per 1000 live births. As part of a larger effort to reduce preventable neonatal deaths in the country, we conducted a study to examine risk factors for low birthweight. The data were collected via a cost‐efficient cluster‐based outcome‐dependent sampling (ODS) scheme wherein clusters of individuals (health centers) were selected on the basis of, in part, the outcome rate of the individuals. For a given data set collected via a cluster‐based ODS scheme, estimation for a marginal model may proceed via inverse‐probability‐weighted generalized estimating equations, where the cluster‐specific weights are the inverse probability of the health center's inclusion in the sample. In this paper, we provide a detailed treatment of the asymptotic properties of this estimator, together with an explicit expression for the asymptotic variance and a corresponding estimator. Furthermore, motivated by the study we conducted in Rwanda, we propose a number of small‐sample bias corrections to both the point estimates and the standard error estimates. Through simulation, we show that applying these corrections when the number of clusters is small generally reduces the bias in the point estimates, and results in closer to nominal coverage. The proposed methods are applied to data from 18 health centers and 1 district hospital in Rwanda.  aPublisher supplied data  aT32ES007142cHarvard T.H.

Freight and its adverse impacts, which include emissions and noise, considerably influence the urban environment. This calls for a reliable assessment of what can be done to improve urban freight and meet stakeholders’ requirements. While changes in a transport system can be simulated using models, urban freight models are quite rare compared to the tools available for analysing private and public transport. Therefore, this article looks at ways to extend Gdynia’s existing mesoscopic transport model by adding data from delivery surveys and examines the city’s capacity for reducing CO<inf>2</inf> emissions through the designation of dedicated delivery places. The results suggest that extending the existing model by including freight-specific data can be justified when basic regulatory measures are to be used to improve freight transport. There are, however, serious limitations when an exact representation of the urban supply chain structure is needed, an element which is required for modelling advanced measures.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon dioxide 3aenvironmental protection 3afreight 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3amodels 3astakeholders 3asupply chain 3asurveys 3aurban areas1 aKaszubowski, Daniel0 tSustainability.g2018 July 18, v. 10, no. 7dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2270x2071-10507nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su100725153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02998naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004400094024004100138024004800179040001800227100005800245245010500303300001400408506007600422506003100498520123000529592002801759596006801787596006001855596006201915506003701977650001702014650001202031650002102043650001502064650002302079653001502102653001802117653001802135653003402153653002002187700006502207773010502272856008802377856004502465961000902510852000902519655001202528IND60525815920221215142809.0190319e20160624xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052581592DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2016.03.0122chorus7 a10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2016.03.0122doi7 a10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2016.03.0122chorusOpen  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBell, David M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2673-583610aOn the dangers of model complexity without ecological justification in species distribution modeling  ap. 50-59.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aCHORUS License Information  aAlthough biogeographic patterns are the product of complex ecological processes, the increasing complexity of correlative species distribution models (SDMs) is not always motivated by ecological theory, but by model fit. The validity of model projections, such as shifts in a species’ climatic niche, becomes questionable particularly during extrapolations, such as for future no-analog climate conditions. To examine the effects of model complexity on SDM predictive performance, we fit statistical models of varying complexity to simulated species occurrence data arising from data-generating processes that assume differing degrees of distributional symmetry in environmental space, interaction effects, and coverage in climate space. Mismatches between data-generating processes and statistical models (i.e., different functional forms) led to poor predictive performance when extrapolating to new climate-space and greater variation in extrapolated predictions for overly complex models. In contrast, performance issues were not apparent when using independent evaluation data from the training region. These results draw into question the use of highly flexible models for prediction without ecological justification.  aPublisher supplied data  cNational Science Foundationdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100006435  cU.S. Forest Servicedhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100006959  cUniversity of Wyomingdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/1000081060 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abiogeography 3aclimate 3amodel validation 3aprediction 3astatistical models 0aPrediction 0aExtrapolation 0aModel fitting 0aSpecies distribution modeling 0aTransferability1 aSchlaepfer, Daniel R.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9973-20650 tEcological modelling.g2016 June 24, v. 330 p.50-59dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl6191x0304-38007nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2016.03.0123Available from publisher's site40uhttp://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/5258159  aUSDA  aDNAL 7aarticle03183naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006400148245012300212300002000335500001900355520157500374592002801949650001901977650002101996650001702017650001502034650002102049650002002070650001202090650001202102650001402114650001702128650002602145650001202171650002702183650002102210650001402231650001302245650000902258651001002267700002502277700003502302700002702337700003002364700002102394773017002415856008302585852000902668655001202677IND60706988120221118042026.0200819e202009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070698812DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-020-09557-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMohapatra, Soudamini1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1849-709X10aPersistence and dissipation study of azoxystrobin, buprofezin, dinocap and hexaconazole on mango (Mangifera indica L.)  ap. 32820-32828.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aAzoxystrobin, buprofezin, dinocap and hexaconazole are widely used in crop protection of mango from flowering to harvest. Residue assessment of these chemicals on mango fruits was done following treatments at the recommended and double doses as per good agricultural practices (GAP). Mango fruit and soil sample preparation was done by QuEChERS, and analysis was done using LC-MS/MS (liquid chromatography mass spectrometry). Using these techniques, the limit of detection (LOD) determined was 1.5 μg kg⁻¹ and limit of quantification (LOQ) was 0.005 mg kg⁻¹ for all analytes. The residue levels on mango initially were 0.265 and 0.55 mg kg⁻¹ for azoxystrobin, 0.63 and 0.974 mg kg⁻¹ for buprofezin, 0.635 and 0.98 mg kg⁻¹ for dinocap and 0.203 and 0.35 mg kg⁻¹ for hexaconazole from standard and double dose treatments, respectively. The dissipation rate of the pesticides on mango fruits was about the same except for azoxystrobin, which dissipated slowly compared with others. The half-life of degradation (DT₅₀) of azoxystrobin was 10.4–12.1 days; buprofezin, 5.8–8.5 days; dinocap, 5.4–6.2 days; and hexaconazole, 4.4–6.1 days. The pre-harvest interval (PHI) based on European Union (EU) MRL (maximum residue limit) requirements were 1 day for azoxystrobin, 15 and 26 days for buprofezin, 27 and 34 days for dinocap, and 19 and 30 days for hexaconazole. The results of this study can be used to produce mango fruits safe for consumption and to meet the regulatory requirements for export of mango fruits from India.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEuropean Union 3aMangifera indica 3aazoxystrobin 3abuprofezin 3achemical species 3adetection limit 3adinocap 3aexports 3ahalf life 3ahexaconazole 3aliquid chromatography 3amangoes 3amaximum residue limits 3aplant protection 3apollution 3aresearch 3asoil 3aIndia1 aSiddamallaiah, Lekha1 aMatadha, Nagapooja Yogendraiah1 aGadigeppa, Shambulinga1 aRaja, Danish Poothotathil1 aUdupi, Veena Rao0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research international.g2020 Sept., v. 27, no. 26 p.32820-32828dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl4122550x0944-13447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-020-09557-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02402naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001700144245010700161300002000268520103600288592002801324650002401352650001401376650002001390650003401410650003101444650001001475650000901485650001401494650002101508650001501529653001501544653001801559653002501577653001701602653000801619653000701627700001701634700005801651700001801709773014201727856007801869852000901947655001201956IND60650878320221121182103.0190710e20190618xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065087832DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.9b072082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKim, Jae-Hun10aLow-Voltage-Driven Sensors Based on ZnO Nanowires for Room-Temperature Detection of NO₂ and CO Gases  ap. 24172-24183.  aHerein, we report the synthesis of pristine and Au-functionalized ZnO nanowires (NWs) for low power consumption (self-heated) gas sensors at room temperature. The ZnO NWs were produced via a vapor–liquid–solid growth technique, and Au layers with different thicknesses were sputter-deposited on the ZnO NWs, followed by subsequent annealing. Microscopic characterization methods demonstrated that ZnO NWs were successfully formed. Pristine ZnO NW gas sensors showed the best sensitivity toward either CO or NO₂ gases at 300 and 350 °C, respectively. Also, the sensitivities of pristine ZnO NW gas sensors were tested toward NO₂ gas under different applied voltages; the sensors revealed a good response and selectivity under an applied voltage of 7 V. Au-functionalized ZnO NW gas sensors exhibited the best response for CO gas at an applied voltage of 7 V and showed a much higher response relative to the pristine ZnO NWs. The sensing mechanisms for pristine and functionalized gas sensors are comprehensively discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aambient temperature 3aannealing 3acarbon monoxide 3aelectric potential difference 3aenergy use and consumption 3agases 3agold 3ananowires 3anitrogen dioxide 3azinc oxide 0agas sensor 0aZnO nanowires 0aAu functionalization 0aself-heating 0aNO2 0aCO1 aMirzaei, Ali1 aKim, Hyoun Woo1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6118-99141 aKim, Sang Sub0 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2019 June 18, v. 11, no. 27 p.24172-24183dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.9b072083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03207naa a2200685 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024002100133040001800154072000900172100001800181245014200199300001600341500002400357500002300381500001500404520084500419650002601264650002201290650002301312650001201335650002101347650005201368650002801420650001001448650002501458650002301483650002601506650002201532650002501554650001201579650005201591650003401643650004201677650005201719650002801771650003601799650004301835650006101878650003201939650002201971653002801993653001902021700001502040700001802055700001702073700002302090773011902113852000902232856007202241856011202313930003302425945002502458946001302483961001302496655001202509IND4366542220221120110134.0050111e200409  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436654222DNAL7 a155299752pmid7 a10.1637/71282doi7 a10113/368602hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL8331 aSellers, H.S.10aDevelopment of a multiplex reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction diagnostic test specific for turkey astrovirus and coronavirus  ap. 531-539.  aIncludes references  aSummary in Spanish  a2019-12-05  aA multiplex reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay was developed for the simultaneous detection of two enteric viruses of poultry: turkey enteric coronavirus (TCV) and turkey astrovirus (TAstV). PCR primers were designed to conserved regions within the nucleocapsid gene of TCV and to the polymerase gene of TAstV-2. The primer pairs were successfully used in a multiplex RT-PCR to detect nucleic acid of TAstV-2 and TCV. The test was optimized for use with intestines/feces from naturally infected turkeys. The primers were specific and did not amplify other common RNA or DNA avian viruses. The detection limit was determined to be 10 ng of RNA used as starting template. The use of this specific test allows the rapid and early diagnosis of two financially costly viruses affecting the commercial turkey industry. 3adiagnostic techniques 3adisease detection 3aTurkey coronavirus 3aturkeys 3apoultry diseases 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3apathogen identification 3agenes 3anucleotide sequences 3amicrobial genetics 3anucleocapsid proteins 3aTurkey astrovirus 2aAgriculturexmethods 2aAnimals 2aAstroviridae Infectionsxdiagnosisxveterinary. 2aCoronavirus, Turkeyxgenetics 2aDNA-Directed DNA Polymerasexgenetics 2aEnteritis, Transmissible, of Turkeysxdiagnosis 2aMamastrovirusxgenetics 2aNucleocapsid Proteinsxgenetics 2aPoultry Diseasesxdiagnosisxgenetics. 2aReverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reactionxmethods 2aSensitivity and Specificity 2aTurkeysxgenetics 0amolecular sequence data 0aviral proteins1 aKoci, M.D.1 aLinnemann, E.1 aKelley, L.A.1 aSchultz-Cherry, S.0 tAvian diseases.g2004 Sept., v.  48, no.  3 p.531-539dAmerican Association of Avian Pathologistsx0005-20867nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1637/71283Available from publisher's Web site40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/368603Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20091231b20100101c00000000  aINDd2CTe2006/06/29  aOther US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle02493naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245009000167300001800257520165600275592002801931650001701959650000901976650001101985650001501996700001802011700002302029773009402052856004802146852000902194655001202203IND50068039020221120205546.0130723e201308  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006803902DNAL7 a10.1007/s10980-013-9883-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSegurado, Pedro10aPrioritizing restoration of structural connectivity in rivers: a graph based approach  ap. 1231-1238.  aLongitudinal connectivity is considered a key issue in river management, as it shapes ecological processes from single organisms to populations and ecosystems. Recently, it was shown that network analysis based on spatial graphs has promising applications as a tool for the assessment of connectivity in riverine systems. In this study we used a graph theory approach to identify which barriers most impacted the structural connectivity of a river basin and which connections should preferably be restored or enhanced in order to effectively improve the overall connectivity. An innovative aspect of the proposed methodology is the consideration of the cumulative non-additive impacts produced by barriers, which are especially relevant to organisms of high mobility such as fish. The portuguese river Tagus basin was used as a case study. The cumulative effect of barriers was studied using two approaches: (1) an historical approach in which the impact of barriers was assessed sequentially following the historical succession of construction; (2) a "backward" approach in which barriers were sequentially removed according to their impact. The overall structural connectivity of the river basin decreased to about 50 % of its original value after the major dams were constructed. Results show that it would be necessary to rehabilitate 11 connections in order to increase the overall structural connectivity to 90 % of its original value. This work proposes a novel and straightforward approach to prioritize rehabilitation actions in river systems, providing a promising tool for decision-makers. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.  aPublisher supplied data 3acase studies 3afish 3arivers 3awatersheds1 aBranco, Paulo1 aFerreira, Maria T.0 tLandscape ecology.g2013 Aug., v. 28, no. 7 p.1231-1238dSpringer-Verlagx0921-29737nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10980-013-9883-z  aDNAL 7aarticle01738naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001400147245007600161300001500237520065100252592002800903650001500931650002500946650002100971650001100992650001201003650000901015650001001024650001701034653001701051653002501068653002001093700001801113700001501131773012601146856008301272852000901355655001201364IND60478499620221119154200.0160121e20100301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6047849962DNAL7 a10.1556/AAgr.58.2010.1.122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSipos, P.10aExamination of chemical composition and calorific value of cereal straw  ap. 97-101.  aRepresentative straw samples from various cereals were analysed to determine their chemical composition and calorific value.

The calorific value of cereal straw was equal to or in some cases greater than that of energy grass, so cereal straw could be competitive with energy grass, due to its large cultivation area and the properties and value of its by-products.  aPublisher supplied data 3abyproducts 3achemical composition 3acultivation area 3aenergy 3agrasses 3aoats 3astraw 3awinter wheat 0acereal straw 0achemical composition 0acalorific value1 aNábrádi, A.1 aGyőri, Z.0 tActa agronomica Academiae Scientiarum Hungaricae.g2010 Mar. 1, v. 58, no. 1 p.97-101dAkadémiai Kiadóx0238-01617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1556%2FAAgr.58.2010.1.123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02731naa a2200253 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003600092040001800128100002200146245011100168300001600279520188400295592002802179650002002207650001102227650002202238700001602260773009802276856008202374852000902456655001202465IND4483198320221122031400.0141110e201206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND448319832DNAL7 a10.1016/j.baae.2012.03.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStraatsma, Gerben10aRarity in large data sets: Singletons, modal values and the location of the species abundance distribution  ap. 380-389.  aSpecies abundance data in 12 large data sets, holding 10Ã10Â³ to 125Ã10â¶ individuals in 350 to 10Ã10Â³ samples, were studied. Samples and subsets, for instance the summarized data of samples over years, and whole sets were analysed. Two methods of the binning of data, assigning abundance values to classes for histograms, have been applied in the past: bins of equal size and bins of exponentially increasing size (âoctavesâ). A hump in a histogram with exponential bins does not represent a mode of primary, non-transformed abundance values, but of log transformed abundance values. A proper interpretation of the hump is given. Moreover, the extrapolation to the left of a histogram with exponential bins, below an abundance of unity, lifting a âveilâ, hiding species present in the community but absent from the sample, is rejected. The literature is confusing at these points and, as a result, prevents a proper view on the species abundance distribution. Applying bins of equal size, modal values equalled or approached unity. The number of singletons increased with sample size in some data sets but decreased in others. However, singletons remain present in large samples, subsets or sets, in agreement with the results on modal values. The relatively high number of singletons in small samples is no artefact of undersampling. The mode at unity, that is at the left end of the species abundance distribution, independent of scale (sample, subset or set), is an important statistical property of the species abundance distribution. Our results may have implications for theory development in community ecology: the selection and/or development of an accurate species abundance model, and, connected to this, the formulation of improved assembly rules, and the selection and/or development of more precise species richness estimators.  aPublisher supplied data 3adata collection 3amodels 3aspecies diversity1 aEgli, Simon0 tBasic and applied ecology.g2012 June, v. 13, no. 4 p.380-389dElsevier GmbHx1439-17917nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.baae.2012.03.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03574naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002100151245009900172300001800271520196900289592002802258596003602286650001802322650002502340650002002365650002502385650001202410650001502422650000902437650001002446650001302456650001402469650001802483650002802501650001402529650003302543650001702576650002002593650001702613650002402630650001002654650001302664653002302677653002602700653002302726700002702749700002402776773014902800856008602949852000903035655001203044IND60676938120200326000000.0191125e20190721xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067693812DNAL7 a10.1080/03235408.2019.16897362doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRafiee, Farzaneh10aEvaluation of burdock and Mountain almond leaf extracts against Meloidogyne javanica on tomato  ap. 1035-1047.  aRoot-knot nematodes (Meloidogyne spp.) are one of the most harmful plant pathogenic nematodes worldwide. Application of some herbal products can safely reduce negative effect of these nematodes. In the present study, the effect of aqueous extracts of Amygdalus scoparia and Arctium lappa on hatching and mortality of second-stage juveniles of M. javanica evaluated under laboratory condition and LC₃₀, LC₅₀, LC₇₀ and LC₉₀ values were determined by probit analysis from March to November 2016. Tomato seeds (cv. Early-Urbana) were sown in 1.5 kg plastic pots and simultaneously were inoculated with 4000 eggs and second stage juveniles (J2s) of M. javanica and soil-drenched (50 ml/pot) with selected concentrations of A. scoparia viz. 0.37, 0.54, 0.8 and 1.39% and A. lappa viz. 0.51, 0.85, 1.4 and 2.91%. The experiments were carried out in completely randomized design tests with four replications. Plant growth parameters as well as nematode population indices were calculated 60 days after inoculation. Results showed that after 120 hours, leaf extracts of A. scoparia at the rate of 7.5 and 10%, and leaf extract of A. lappa at the rate of 10% lead to 100% inhibition of M. javanica egg hatching under laboratory condition. Leaf extracts of both of the tested plants at the rate of 2% caused 100% mortality of J2s. Any increase in concentration of used plant extracts significantly improved the growth indices in both of the inoculated and uninoculated tomato plants. As compared to control, application of A. scoparia leaf extract at the rate of 2%, reduced the number of galls, egg masses and eggs per root system as well as the number of J2s per pot and reproduction factor of nematode by 37, 43, 45, 73 and 46%, and in the case of A. lappa, these indices reduced by15, 26, 27, 74 and 28%, respectively. Our results showed potential of leaf extracts of A. scoparia and A. lappa for management of M. javanica infecting tomato plants.  aPublisher supplied data  cYasouj University, Yasouj, Iran 3aArctium lappa 3aMeloidogyne javanica 3aPrunus scoparia 3aSolanum lycopersicum 3aalmonds 3aegg masses 3aeggs 3agalls 3ahatching 3ajuveniles 3aleaf extracts 3alethal concentration 50 3amortality 3aplant diseases and disorders 3aplant growth 3aprobit analysis 3aroot systems 3aroot-knot nematodes 3aseeds 3atomatoes 0aAmygdalus scoparia 0alethal concentrations 0aroot-knot nematode1 aCharehgani, Habiballah1 aAbdollahi, Mohammad0 tArchiv für Phytopathologie und Pflanzenschutz.g2019 July 21, v. 52, no. 11-12 p.1035-1047dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl49030x1477-29067nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/03235408.2019.16897363Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03329naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245015500163300001200318520146700330592002801797596007501825650002901900650001201929650003501941650002501976650001202001650001302013650001102026650001602037650003902053650001702092650001302109650000902122650001202131650001502143650003102158650003302189650000902222650002002231650001102251650002702262650001402289650001202303650001302315650000902328651001002337651001802347700001902365700001402384700001402398700001202412700001602424700001802440700002002458773013502478856008102613852000902694655001202703IND60601074120221119191512.0180705e201807  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060107412DNAL7 a10.1007/s12665-018-7621-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Yafeng10aComprehensive risk assessment and source apportionment of heavy metal contamination in the surface sediment of the Yangtze River Anqing section, China  ap. 493.  aThe Yangzi River has been seriously affected by intensive anthropogenic activities in recent years. In this study, the levels and distribution, risk assessment, and source apportionment of heavy metals in sediments were investigated in the Yangtze River (Anqing section). The heavy metal concentration and chemical characteristics (Cu/Pb/Zn/Cd/Cr/As/Hg) of 16 samples over four sections were measured using Atomic Fluorescence Spectrometry and Graphite Furnace Atomic Absorption Spectrometry. The metal concentration in the study area showed variance in different sampling sites. The mean heavy metal content was also higher than the background value. Vertical analysis of metal concentration showed the decreasing order from surface sediment. The analysis of Hakanson’s potential risk assessment indicated that the total potential ecological risk of these elements amounted to a considerable pollution level in the study area. The result of geo-accumulation index indicated that the risk of the studied metals had the following decreasing order: Cd > Hg > Pb > Cu > Zn > As > Cr. Based on the result of enrichment factor and principal component analysis, Cr, As, Hg, and partly Zn, Cu, and Cd mostly originated from natural sources. Pb and partly Cu and Zn mostly originated from gas companies, industries, and traffic sources, whereas Cd and partly Zn represented agricultural activities, such as fertilizer and pesticide consumption.  aPublisher supplied data  a2016YFC0502705cNational Key Research and Development Program of China 3aanthropogenic activities 3aarsenic 3aatomic absorption spectrometry 3abusiness enterprises 3acadmium 3achromium 3acopper 3afertilizers 3afluorescence emission spectroscopy 3aheavy metals 3aindustry 3alead 3amercury 3apesticides 3aphysicochemical properties 3aprincipal component analysis 3arisk 3arisk assessment 3arivers 3asediment contamination 3asediments 3atraffic 3avariance 3azinc 3aChina 3aYangtze River1 aHuang, Honghui1 aSun, Ting1 aYuanyuan,1 aPan, Ye1 aXie, Yujing1 aFan, Zhengqiu1 aWang, Xiangrong0 tEnvironmental earth sciences.g2018 July, v. 77, no. 13 p.493-493dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:J000001228x1866-62807nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12665-018-7621-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02329naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002700150245008000177300001600257520102500273592002801298650002201326650002401348650001501372650001001387650001101397650001401408650001701422650002101439653000801460653001401468653001301482653001801495653002001513653000901533653000801542653001001550653000801560653000801568653000801576653000801584653000701592700002901599700001801628773009501646856008501741852000901826655001201835IND60582530720221122221522.0180831e201602  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058253072DNAL7 a10.1016/j.wasman.2015.11.0272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aÇepelioğullar, Özge10aKinetic modelling of RDF pyrolysis: Model-fitting and model-free approaches  ap. 275-284.  aIn this study, refuse derived fuel (RDF) was selected as solid fuel and it was pyrolyzed in a thermal analyzer from room temperature to 900°C at heating rates of 5, 10, 20, and 50°C/min in N2 atmosphere. The obtained thermal data was used to calculate the kinetic parameters using Coats-Redfern, Friedman, Flylnn-Wall-Ozawa (FWO) and Kissinger-Akahira-Sunose (KAS) methods. As a result of Coats-Redfern model, decomposition process was assumed to be four independent reactions with different reaction orders. On the other hand, model free methods demonstrated that activation energy trend had similarities for the reaction progresses of 0.1, 0.2–0.7 and 0.8–0.9. The average activation energies were found between 73–161kJ/mol and it is possible to say that FWO and KAS models produced closer results to the average activation energies compared to Friedman model. Experimental studies showed that RDF may be a sustainable and promising feedstock for alternative processes in terms of waste management strategies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactivation energy 3aambient temperature 3afeedstocks 3afuels 3amodels 3apyrolysis 3asolid wastes 3awaste management 0aRDF 0aPyrolysis 0aKinetics 0aModel-fitting 0aIsoconversional 0aASTM 0aDTG 0aFT-IR 0aFWO 0aKAS 0aRDF 0aSEM 0aTG1 aHaykırı-Açma, Hanzade1 aYaman, Serdar0 tWaste management.g2016 Feb., v. 48 p.275-284dElsevier LtdwJournal:6325x0956-053X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2015.11.0273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02253naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245007600165300001500241520092100256592002801177650002001205650001301225650001101238650001501249650002201264650001501286650001001301650002101311651001501332653002101347653002101368653002101389653002301410653001501433653003001448653003201478653002301510653002401533700001701557700001701574773011401591856008101705852000901786655001201795IND60479386520221122234928.0160121e20000701xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6047938652DNAL7 a10.1556/ComEc.1.2000.1.132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPalmer, M.

However, the study of fine-scale richness is complicated by the rarefaction effect: that is, a trivial correlation between the number of individuals and the number of species. We developed null models to test whether fine-scale species richness differs from random expectation, and applied these models to a dataset of 1170 100 m<sup>2</sup>circular plots in the old-growth portion of La Selva Biological Station in the Atlantic Lowlands of Costa Rica. Although species richness in these plots was close to its theoretical maximum, we found that it was frequently lower than null expectation. This was a result of slightly clumped distributions within species. We found no relationships between species richness at the 100 m<sup>2</sup>scale and soil type or topography, after accounting for the effects of density.  aPublisher supplied data 3adata collection 3alowlands 3amodels 3asoil types 3aspecies diversity 3atopography 3atrees 3atropical forests 3aCosta Rica 0aSpecies richness 0aSpecies richness 0aSpecies richness 0aRandomization test 0aCosta Rica 0aGeneralized linear models 0aLa Selva Biological Station 0aRarefaction effect 0aTropical rainforest1 aClark, D.

Herein, by means of comprehensive density functional theory (DFT) computations, we systematically explored the potential of pyrrolic-N doped graphene (pyrrolic-N₄-G) supported various transition metal atoms (TM = Sc, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Mo, Ru, Pd, W, Os, Ir, and Pt) as electrocatalysts for the ORR and OER. Our results revealed that these TM/pyrrolic-N₄-G candidates exhibit high electrochemical stability due to their positive dissolution potentials. Especially, the Ir/pyrrolic-N₄-G can perform as a promising bifunctional electrocatalyst for both ORR and OER with the low overpotentials (ηᴼᴿᴿ = 0.34 V and ηᴼᴱᴿ = 0.32 V). Interestingly, multiple-level descriptors, including energy descriptor (ΔGOH* - ΔGO*), (ΔGOH*), structure descriptor (φ), and d-band center (ε) can well rationalize the origin of the high catalytic activity of Ir/pyrrolic-N₄-G for the ORR/OER. Our findings not only further enrich the SACs, but also open a new avenue to develop novel 2D materials-based SACs for highly efficient oxygen electrocatalysts.  aPublisher supplied data 3acatalytic activity 3adensity functional theory 3aelectrochemistry 3aenergy conversion 3agraphene 3aoxygen 3aoxygen production 3arenewable energy sources 0aSingle atom catalysts 0aTM-N/C materials 0aORR/OER 0aBifunctional catalysts 0aDFT1 aSu, Zhanhua1 aZhao, Zhifeng1 aCai, Qinghai1 aLi, Yafei1 aZhao, Jingxiang0 tJournal of colloid and interface science.g2022 Feb., v. 607 p.1005-1013dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12461x0021-97977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcis.2021.09.0453Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01830naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002400150245011700174300001800291520078100309592002801090650001201118650002301130650001301153650001201166653002001178653001801198653001801216653001301234653002201247700001801269773011201287856008401399852000901483655001201492IND60599504420221118111447.0180702e20140730xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059950442DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tetlet.2014.06.0302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDumeunier, Raphaël10aToluene as a novel carrier of xanthates—preparation, use and surrogate of S-tri- and di-chloromethyl xanthates  ap. 4410-4414.  aToluene has been identified as a novel carrier of xanthates. Their corresponding fragmentative precursors proved to behave efficiently in radical group transfer reactions. As examples, unprecedented S-tri/di-chloromethyl xanthates could be prepared, isolated and further used in radical additions to olefins. Their precursors (de-aromatized toluene upon which is grafted, at one end, a tri/di-chloromethyl-group and, at the other end, a dithiocarbonyl group) can also be used directly in the transfer of both groups to olefins. The re-aromatizing loss of toluene by radical initiated fragmentation of the precursors brings thus new opportunities to the chemistry of xanthates, exemplified here in the intermolecular additions to olefins of new S-tri/di-chloromethyl xanthates.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalkenes 3achemical reactions 3amoieties 3atoluene 0aRearomatization 0aRadical chain 0aFragmentation 0aXanthate 0aTransfer reaction1 aHuber, Annika0 tTetrahedron letters.g2014 July 30, v. 55, no. 31 p.4410-4414dElsevier LtdwJournal:11745x0040-40397nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tetlet.2014.06.0303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02349naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024003800135040001800173100002100191245009800212300001600310506007600326520074100402592002801143506003701171650001101208650001701219650001301236650001301249650002201262650004001284650004701324650003701371650002301408650001101431650002201442650002601464650003101490650002101521651001101542653002201553653001701575653002201592700001401614700001601628700001401644773011301658856005101771852000901822655001201831IND50087201720221207090433.0140412e20110601xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5008720172DNAL7 a216235022pmid7 aPMC31184862pmcid7 a10.1080/19440049.2011.5592782doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTittlemier, S.A.10aSampling of cereals and cereal-based foods for the determination of ochratoxin A: an overview  ap. 775-785.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe mycotoxin ochratoxin A (OTA) is known to be heterogeneously distributed both intrinsically (from one individual food item to the next) as well as distributionally (throughout a sample of individual food items) in cereals and cereal-based foods. Therefore, proper sampling and sample comminution are special challenges, but are prerequisites for obtaining sound analytical data. This paper outlines the issue of the sampling process for cereals and cereal-based foods, starting with the planning phase, followed by the sampling step itself and the formation of analytical samples. The sampling of whole grain and retail-level cereal-based foods will be discussed. Furthermore, possibilities to reduce sampling variance are presented.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3agrains 3aochratoxin A 3aplanning 3avariance 3awhole grain foods 2aEdible Grainxchemistryxstandards. 2aCrops, Agriculturalxchemistryxstandards. 2aFast Foodsxanalysisxstandards. 2aFood Contamination 2aHumans 2aLegislation, Food 2aOchratoxinsxanalysis 2aReproducibility of Results 2aSeedsxchemistry 0aCanada 0aquality assurance 0aochratoxin A 0acereals and grain1 aVarga, E.1 aScott, P.M.1 aKrska, R.0 tFood additives & contaminants.g2011 June 1, v. 28, no. 6 p.775-785dTaylor & Francis Groupx1944-00577nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/19440049.2011.559278  aDNAL 7aarticle01890naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001700140245014000157520093100297592002801228650002501256650002301281650001501304650000901319700002001328700002101348700002101369773012701390856007401517852000901591655001201600IND60652359620221118022004.0190712e20180718xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065235962DNAL7 a10.3390/su100725192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVeit, Claire14aThe Impact of Sustainable Sourcing on Customer Perceptions: Association by Guilt from Scandals in Local vs. Offshore Sourcing Countries  aThis study analyzes whether customer perceptions towards sustainability are affected by a company&rsquo;s country of origin and sourcing strategies.

It adds the country of origin to the link between customer and company, and analyzes if and how customer perceptions change when they are introduced to a sustainability scandal, hence analyzing possible &lsquo;association by guilt&rsquo;. It compares their reactions to offshore scandals and to local scandals, therefore taking psychic distance as an important variable into consideration. Customer perceptions of company sustainability was found to have an impact on purchasing behavior. Findings show that perceptions are influenced by psychic distance. Furthermore, companies should take into account the risk of association by guilt when developing their global sourcing strategies.  aPublisher supplied data 3abusiness enterprises 3aconsumer attitudes 3apurchasing 3arisk1 aLambrechts, Wim1 aQuintens, Lieven1 aSemeijn, Janjaap0 tSustainability.g2018 July 18, v. 10, no. 7dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2270x2071-10507nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su100725193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03213naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002100151245008900172300001800261500001900279520138700298536025401685592002801939596009301967596004702060596007402107650001202181650001102193650001502204650002102219650001702240650001502257650001702272650001502289650002502304650001602329653001302345653003202358653003002390653002002420700001502440700002102455700002002476773014102496856008502637852000902722655001202731IND60676938420221118162401.0191122e20191110xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067693842DNAL7 a10.1080/15226514.2019.16332532doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRehman, Khadeeja10aFloating treatment wetlands as biological buoyant filters for wastewater reclamation  ap. 1273-1289.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aFloating treatment wetlands (FTWs) are an innovative product of ecological engineering that can play a promising role in wastewater treatment. It provides low-cost, eco-friendly, and sustainable solutions for the treatment of wastewater, particularly in regions with economic constraints. Generally, FTWs comprise rooted plants that grow on the surface of water with their roots extending down into the pelagic zone rather than being embedded into the sediments. This drooping structure helps develop (1) a hydraulic flow between the root network and the bottom of the treatment system and (2) a large biologically active surface area for the physical entrapment (filtration) of contaminants, as well as their biochemical transformation and degradation. Furthermore, the rooted network allows proliferation of microorganisms that form biofilms and enhance pollutant degradation while promoting plant growth. The augmentation of bacteria in FTWs has been proven to be the most effective approach for reclamation of wastewater. This article discusses the operational parameters of FTWs for maximal remediation of wastewater and highlights the importance of plant-bacteria partnerships in a typical FTW system for enhanced cleanup of wastewater. We propose that this technology is preferable over other methods that require high energy, costs, and area to install or operate machinery.  aThe research was supported by the Higher Education Commission, Pakistan [1-52/ILS-UITSP/HEC/2014 and 20-3854/R7D/HEC/14] and International Foundation of Science (IFS) Sweden and Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) [W/5104-2].  aPublisher supplied data  a1-52/ILS-UITSP/HEC/2014a20-3854/R7D/HEC/14cHigher Education Commission (HEC), Pakistan  cInternational Foundation of Science (IFS),  aW/5104-2cOrganization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) 3abiofilm 3aenergy 3afiltration 3aphytoremediation 3aplant growth 3apollutants 3asurface area 3awastewater 3awastewater treatment 3awater reuse 0aEffluent 0afloating treatment wetlands 0aplant-microbe interaction 0awater pollution1 aIjaz, Amna1 aArslan, Muhammad1 aAfzal, Muhammad0 tInternational journal of phytoremediation.g2019 Nov. 10, v. 21, no. 13 p.1273-1289dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl62892x1549-78797nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15226514.2019.16332533Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03197naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002100164245011600185300001400301520142100315592002801736650002501764650002601789650001901815650001301834650001301847650002601860650001801886650001501904650003001919650003701949650001801986650001302004650001202017650002202029650001602051650002202067650001102089650003802100650001302138650004002151650005202191650005902243650002002302650004202322651001302364700002702377700003102404700002602435773011302461856004802574852000902622655001202631IND4466973420221120134227.0120727e201201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446697342DNAL7 a214093652pmid7 a10.1007/s10661-011-1943-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCachada, Anabela10aSources of potentially toxic elements and organic pollutants in an urban area subjected to an industrial impact  ap. 15-32.  aUrban and industrial development has caused a major impact on environmental soil quality. This work assesses the extent and severity of contamination in a small urban area subjected to an industrial impact and identifies the major anthropogenic inputs. Twenty-six soil samples were collected from agricultural and urban sites, and concentrations of potentially toxic elements (As, Cd, Cu, Cr, Fe, Mn, Ni, Pb and Zn), PAHs and PCBs, were determined. In spite of the low median concentrations observed, some sites represent a potential hazard for human health and ecosystems. Concentrations of contaminants were higher than those found in a nearby city, indicating that the study area is affected by the surrounding industry. The use of multivariate statistical analyses allowed for the identification of the main factors controlling the variability of potentially toxic elements and organic pollutants in the soils. The presence of Cr, Fe, Mn and Ni was associated with geogenic inputs, and Cu, Pb, Zn, As, PAHs and PCBs were associated with anthropogenic inputs. Industry and traffic were the most important anthropogenic sources. Soil characteristics were identified as important factors controlling the spatial variability of elements, both from recognised natural and anthropogenic origin. Differences between land uses were observed, which may be attributed to both management practices and proximity to sources.  aPublisher supplied data 3aenvironmental impact 3aenvironmental quality 3ahealth hazards 3aindustry 3aland use 3amultivariate analysis 3aorganic soils 3apollutants 3apolychlorinated biphenyls 3apolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons 3asoil sampling 3atoxicity 3atraffic 3aurban agriculture 3aurban areas 3aurban development 2aCities 2aEnvironmental Monitoringxmethods 2aIndustry 2aMetals, Heavyxchemistryxtoxicity. 2aPolychlorinated Biphenylsxchemistryxtoxicity. 2aPolycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbonsxchemistryxtoxicity. 2aSoilxchemistry 2aSoil Pollutantsxchemistryxtoxicity. 0aPortugal1 aPereira, Maria Eduarda1 aFerreira da Silva, Eduardo1 aDuarte, Armando Costa0 tEnvironmental monitoring and assessment.g2012 Jan., v. 184, no. 1 p.15-32dSpringer-Verlagx0167-63697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-011-1943-8  aDNAL 7aarticle02638naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002000148245016400168520134800332592002801680650002501708650001801733650001401751650002901765650001401794650002601808650002101834653001301855653001301868653001501881653002101896653002501917653002201942700001701964700002001981700002302001773012402024856008302148852000902231655001202240IND60695372020221121224337.0201023e202008  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069537202DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jaap.2020.1048412doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLa Nasa, Jacopo12aA review on challenges and developments of analytical pyrolysis and other thermoanalytical techniques for the quali-quantitative determination of microplastics  aEnvironmental pollution from microplastics (MPs) and the associated health and environmental risks are the focus of intense multidisciplinary research. In fact, that there is an urgent need to produce quantitative and qualitative data on the amount and types of MPs in environmental matrices, organisms, and commodities, and to perform spatial and temporal comparisons. This has led to the development, optimization and application of analytical methods to characterize MPs in aquatic, terrestrial or biological samples.Instrumental analytical techniques based on analytical pyrolysis and thermal analyses provide qualitative and mass-based quantitative information and have a high potential to become of general use in the analysis of MPs.This paper reviews the research carried out to date in the analysis of MPs by analytical thermal and pyrolysis techniques. The aim is to provide a detailed and comprehensive critical examination of recent quantitative analysis developments, integrated with a brief historical excursus.The main analytical issues and limitations are described with practical detail, to provide an overview of the rapid ongoing development of this sector of analytical chemistry, and to contribute to the activities aimed at evaluating, comparing and standardising analytical techniques and analytical data in MP research.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanalytical chemistry 3amicroplastics 3apollution 3aproducts and commodities 3apyrolysis 3aquantitative analysis 3athermal analysis 0aPlastics 0aPolymers 0aPy-GC–MS 0aThermochemolysis 0aEvolved gas analysis 0aMass-spectrometry1 aBiale, Greta1 aFabbri, Daniele1 aModugno, Francesca0 tJournal of analytical and applied pyrolysis.g2020 Aug., v. 149 p.104841-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6382x0165-23707nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jaap.2020.1048413Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02812naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100005600150245008400206300001800290520106500308592002801373596009801401596008001499596010401579596010401683596010401787596008401891650001901975650001101994650001902005650001902024650002202043650001902065650001602084700005502100700005202155773011302207856008502320852000902405655001202414IND60778889320221121232541.0220601e20220519xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077888932DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.langmuir.2c008202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGuo, Changfa1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0432-812110aPerspective on Defective Semiconductor Heterojunctions for CO₂ Photoreduction  ap. 6491-6498.  aPhotocatalytic CO₂ reduction to value-added chemicals is a green solution to concurrently address CO₂ emission and energy issues, and semiconductor heterojunctions hold great potential to achieve such conversion. However, the photocatalytic performance of the existing heterojunctions is limited by the low interfacial charge transfer efficiency and sluggish surface reaction kinetics. To overcome these obstacles, defect engineering has been applied to heterojunctions to boost CO₂ photoreduction in the past 5 years. This perspective summaries the key roles and the related mechanism of various anion vacancies located at the surface, interface, and both surface and interface of heterojunctions in photocatalytic CO₂ reduction. Challenges in constructing and characterizating defective heterojunctions as well as in promoting their CO₂ photoreduction activity and hydrocarbon selectivity are then outlined. Finally, some solutions to the rational design of defective heterojunctions for efficient and stable CO₂ photoreduction are also proposed.  aPublisher supplied data  a22102145cNational Natural Science Foundation of Chinadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100001809  a2020ZS03cZhejiang Normal Universitydhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100004706  aLD22B030002cNatural Science Foundation of Zhejiang Provincedhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100004731  aLY21B030003cNatural Science Foundation of Zhejiang Provincedhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100004731  aLY22B030012cNatural Science Foundation of Zhejiang Provincedhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100004731  a2021R51009cZhejiang Provincial Ten Thousand Talent Programdhttps://doi.org/NA 3acarbon dioxide 3aenergy 3aphotocatalysis 3aphotoreduction 3areaction kinetics 3asemiconductors 3avalue added1 aChen, De-Li1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3550-51191 aHu, Yong1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3777-167X0 tLangmuir.g2022 May 19, v. 38, no. 21 p.6491-6498dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19170x1520-58277nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.langmuir.2c008203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03249naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001800144245012300162300002000285520149800305592002801803596009901831650001601930650003001946650001601976650001101992650001302003650001502016650001902031650003002050650001902080650001602099653000902115653000902124653002002133653002702153653000802180700005902188700001902247700001602266700003102282700005702313700005902370700006602429700001802495773014202513856007902655852000902734655001202743IND60785827120221118064836.0220728e20220714xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078582712DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.2c088422doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Hailiang10aFabrication of High-Performance Solar Cells and X-ray Detectors Using MoX₂@CNT Nanocomposite-Tuned Perovskite Layers  ap. 33626-33640.  aThe interface design of inorganic and organic halide perovskite-based devices plays an important role to attain high performance. The modification of transport layers (ETL and HTL) or the perovskite layer is given the crucial inspiration to realize superior power conversion efficiencies (PCEs). The highly conducting 2D materials of CNT, graphene/GO, and transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) are suitable substitutes to tune the electronic structure/work function of perovskite devices. Herein, the nanocomposites composed of molybdenum dichalcogenides (MoX₂ = MoS₂, MoSe₂, and MoTe₂) stretched CNT was embedded with HTL or perovskite layer to improve the resulted characteristics of perovskite devices of solar cells and X-ray detectors. A superior solar cell efficiency of 12.57% was realized for the MoTe₂@CNT nanocomposites using a modified active layer-composed device. Additionally, X-ray detectors with MoTe₂@CNT-modulated active layers achieved 13.32 μA/cm², 3.99 mA/Gy·cm², 4.81 × 10–⁴ cm²/V·s, and 2.13 × 10¹⁵ cm²/V·s of CCD-DCD, sensitivity, mobility, and trap density, respectively. Density functional theory approximation was used to realize the improved electronics properties, optical properties, and energy band structures in the MoX₂@CNT-doped perovskites evidently. Thus, the current research paves the way for the improvement of highly efficient semiconductor devices based on perovskite-based structures with the use of 2D nanocomposites.  aPublisher supplied data  a2019R1A2C2086747cNational Research Foundation of Koreadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100003725 3aX-radiation 3adensity functional theory 3aelectronics 3aenergy 3agraphene 3amolybdenum 3ananocomposites 3aorganic halogen compounds 3asemiconductors 3asolar cells 0aMoX2 0aCNTs 0aX-ray detectors 0aperovskite solar cells 0aDFT1 aHussain, Sajjad1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0035-99751 aAbbas, Zeesham1 aLee, Jehoon1 aAbbas Jaffery, Syed Hassan1 aJung, Jongwan1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1397-212X1 aKim, Hyun-Seok,1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1127-57661 aVikraman, Dhanasekaran1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8991-36041 aKang, Jungwon0 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2022 July 14, v. 14, no. 29 p.33626-33640dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.2c088423Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03459naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100005600142245013800198300001800336500002000354520150700374592002801881596005001909596005001959596005002009596009402059596006202153596008502215596005902300650001102359650001102370650001102381650001502392650001102407650001302418650002302431650001302454650001502467651001802482651001702500651001402517651001402531700002402545700005102569700005402620700005102674773013002725856007702855852000902932655001202941IND60789621520221121081653.0220822e201705  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078962152DNAL7 a10.1002/2016JC0126622doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCheng, Xuhua1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3055-977510aIntraseasonal‐to‐semiannual variability of sea‐surface height in the astern, equatorial Indian Ocean and southern Bay of Bengal  ap. 4051-4067.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aIntraseasonal‐to‐semiannual variability of sea‐surface height (SSH) in the eastern, equatorial Indian Ocean (EEIO) and southern Bay of Bengal (BoB) is investigated using altimetric data, and solutions to 1½ layer (first baroclinic mode) and linear, continuously stratified (LCS; multibaroclinic‐mode) models. The amplitude and dominant periods of SSH variability differ regionally. Large‐amplitude variability is found along the west coast of Sumatra, in a zonal band across the BoB centered along 5°N, east of Sri Lanka, and in the northwestern BoB, respectively. Along the Sumatran west coast, SSH variability peaks at 30–60, 90, and 180 days. Along 5°N and east of Sri Lanka, the 30–60 day variability is dominant. Sensitivity experiments using a nonlinear version of the 1½ layer model forced by realistic winds reproduce the observed patterns of intraseasonal variability in the southern BoB. At 30–60 days, the solutions show that eddies (nonlinear Rossby waves) propagating from the east, rather than local wind forcing, account for most of the variance east of Sri Lanka; furthermore, they demonstrate that the variance is significantly enhanced by the nonlinear transfer of 90–120 day energy into the intraseasonal band of 30–60 days. The LCS solutions show that the first two baroclinic modes explain most of the SSH variance at 90–180 days. The second baroclinic mode dominates the SSH variance at 180 days, a consequence of basin resonance and strong wind forcing.  aPublisher supplied data  a41522601cNatural Science Foundation of China  a41525019cNatural Science Foundation of China  a41521005cNatural Science Foundation of China  aXDA11010103c“Strategic Priority Research Program” of the Chinese Academy of Sciences  aGASI‐IPOVAI‐02cState Oceanic Administration of China  aLTOZZ1501cOpen Project Program of State Key Laboratory of Tropical Oceanography  a201506010036cPear River S&T Nova Program of Guangzhou 3abasins 3acoasts 3aenergy 3ageophysics 3amodels 3aresearch 3aseasonal variation 3avariance 3awind speed 3aBay of Bengal 3aIndian Ocean 3aIndonesia 3aSri Lanka1 aMcCreary, Julian P.1 aQiu, Bo1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3841-64501 aQi, Yiquan1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2255-187X1 aDu, Yan1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7842-08010 tJournal of geophysical research.g2017 May, v. 122, no. 5 p.4051-4067dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:27942x2169-92757nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/2016JC0126623Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02690naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004400094040001800138100001100156245005700167300001600224520140600240592002801646650001301674650001201687650001501699650001401714650001401728650001001742650002201752650001101774650001301785650002301798650002201821650001501843650001901858650001601877700001601893700001801909700001901927700002101946700001801967700002001985773009302005856009002098990002302188852000902211655001202220IND60095825320221119041721.0141104e201305  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009582532DNAL7 a10.1016/j.combustflame.2013.01.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Bo10aPost-flame gas-phase sulfation of potassium chloride  ap. 959-969.  aThe sulfation of KCl during biomass combustion has implications for operation and emissions: it reduces the rates of deposition and corrosion, it increases the formation of aerosols, and it leads to higher concentrations of HCl and lower concentrations of SO₂ in the gas phase. Rigorously homogeneous systems are required to characterize the gas-phase formation of alkali sulfates. We have measured the temperature and gas-phase concentrations of KCl and HCl, and detected the presence of aerosols in the post-flame region of a range of hydrocarbon flames seeded with KCl, with and without the addition of SO₂. Dilution of the flame products with different amounts of N₂ ensured post-flame temperatures in the range 950–1400K. In the absence of SO₂, KCl levels were constant in the post-flame zone and no aerosols were formed, even at the lowest temperatures. In the presence of SO₂, KCl was consumed and HCl and aerosols formed, most pronounced in flames with the lowest post-flame temperatures. This shows that KCl is sulfated in the gas phase to K₂SO₄, and this is followed by homogeneous nucleation of K₂SO₄ to form aerosols. Predictions from a kinetic model of the S/Cl/K chemistry agreed well with the experimental results. The model showed that the rate-limiting steps in the sulfation process are the oxidation of SO₂ to SO₃ and the homogeneous nucleation of K₂SO₄.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaerosols 3abiomass 3acombustion 3acorrosion 3aemissions 3agases 3ahydrochloric acid 3amodels 3anitrogen 3apotassium chloride 3apotassium sulfate 3aprediction 3asulfur dioxide 3atemperature1 aSun, Zhiwei1 aLi, Zhongshan1 aAldén, Marcus1 aJakobsen, Jon G.1 aHansen, Stine1 aGlarborg, Peter0 tCombustion and Flame.g2013 May, v. 160, no. 5 p.959-969dElsevier Inc.x0010-21807nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.combustflame.2013.01.0103Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02463naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002500150245008000175300001800255520138500273592002801658596009901686650001501785650001601800650001101816650002601827650001301853650002001866700005601886773011301942856008502055852000902140655001202149IND60778889520220601000000.0220601e20220518xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077888952DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.langmuir.2c009482doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBayles, Alexandra V.10aDivide, Conquer, and Stabilize: Engineering Strong Fluid–Fluid Interfaces  ap. 6499-6505.  aIn multiphase materials, structured fluid–fluid interfaces can provide mechanical resistance against destabilization. Coarsening, coalescence, and significant deformation can be stalled with appropriate interfacial rheology and thus preserve interface integrity. Often, interfacial “strength” is generated by dense, packed surface populations, which are challenging to achieve through gradual, equilibrium-limited adsorption. Recent efforts have focused on developing new methods to produce kinetically trapped interfacial structures that possess desirable viscoelasticity or viscoplasticity, sometimes even with sparse populations. In creating these interfaces, we should recognize that the processing history is deterministic and offers alternative handles to engineer useful rheology. In this Perspective, we consider what can be achieved by designing not only the intrinsic qualities of surface-active species but also the process that brings them to the interface. We contrast different classes of processing history through a somewhat historical lens: after creating an interface (“divide”), what (“conquering”) strategies exist for populating it with agents that ensure stabilization? Navigating the delicate interplay among property, structure, and processing history is required to improve material and energy use and to realize unique multiphase materials.  aPublisher supplied data  aFEL19-1-53cEidgen?ssische Technische Hochschule Z?richdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100003006 3aadsorption 3adeformation 3aenergy 3amechanical properties 3arheology 3aviscoelasticity1 aVermant, Jan1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0352-06560 tLangmuir.g2022 May 18, v. 38, no. 21 p.6499-6505dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19170x1520-58277nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.langmuir.2c009483Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03887naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245018100170520207700351592002802428650002502456650002502481650001302506650001202519650002002531650001202551650001102563650001602574650002602590650001502616650002202631650003302653650002702686650001602713650002502729651001202754653002502766653001102791653004102802653003902843653002302882653002502905700002102930700001902951700001902970700002102989700001903010700002903029700001903058700003103077773011803108856008603226852000903312655001203321IND60776536420221118220208.0220726e20220915xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077653642DNAL7 a10.1016/j.indcrop.2022.1149772doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBrahmi, Fatiha10aOptimization of the conditions for ultrasound-assisted extraction of phenolic compounds from Opuntia ficus-indica [L.] Mill. flowers and comparison with conventional procedures  aOpuntia ficus-indica [L.] Mill. (OFI) flower has been studied less than OFI fruit and cladode for the bioactive compounds occurrence. Also, ultrasound-assisted extraction (UAE) technique has been applied less than conventional techniques to extract bioactive compounds, generally. In this work, UAE was developed to extract phenolic compounds from OFI flowers, collected from wild population plants in the department of Bejaia (Algeria). Single-factor experiments and response surface methodology were designed to study the effect of ethanol concentration (20–100%), extraction time (10–60 min), and extraction temperature (30–70 °C) on the total phenolic content (TPC). Optimal UAE conditions were 36% ethanol, an extraction time of 60 min, and a temperature of 53 °C, which produced an extraction of 24.4 ± 0.82 mg of total phenolics expressed as mg Gallic Acid Equivalent (GAE)/g Dry Weight (DW). The bioactive compounds extraction efficiency was statistically higher using UAE than using conventional extraction methods (maceration and Soxhlet extraction). The Liquid Chromatography Time-of-Flight Mass Spectrometry (LC/MS–TOF) analysis of the optimized UAE extract detected mostly the occurrence of phenolic acids (piscidic and eucomic acids) and isorahmnetin derivatives. Interestingly, piscidic and eucomic acids have been identified and quantified for the first time in OFI flower extract. The antioxidant activity assessed with different assays were 13.8 ± 0.27μmol Trolox Equivalent (TE)/g DW for DPPH, 4078 ± 80.3 μmol TE/g DW for Ferric Reducing Antioxidant Power (FRAP), 3091 ± 139 μmol TE/g DW for total antioxidant activity (TAA) by phosphomolybdate assay, 80.8 ± 4.17μmol TE/g DW for Trolox Equivalent Antioxidant Capacity (TEAC) by ABTS assay. The UAE process deeply enhanced the yield and significantly reduced the extraction time in comparison with conventional methods (maceration and Soxhlet extraction), confirming that OFI flower is a valuable source of bioactive compounds that can be exploited in some industries.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOpuntia ficus-indica 3aantioxidant activity 3acladodes 3aethanol 3aflower extracts 3aflowers 3afruits 3agallic acid 3aliquid chromatography 3amaceration 3amass spectrometry 3aresponse surface methodology 3asolid phase extraction 3atemperature 3aultrasonic treatment 3aAlgeria 0aOpuntia ficus-indica 0aFlower 0aUltrasound-assisted extraction (UAE) 0aResponse surface methodology (RSM) 0aPhenolic compounds 0aAntioxidant activity1 aBlando, Federica1 aSellami, Redha1 aMehdi, Sabrina1 aDe Bellis, Luigi1 aNegro, Carmine1 aHaddadi-Guemghar, Hayate1 aMadani, Khodir1 aMakhlouf-Boulekbache, Lila0 tIndustrial crops and products.g2022 Sept. 15, v. 184 p.114977-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl49222x0926-66907nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.indcrop.2022.1149773Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02314naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004400094040001800138100002200156245007500178300001600253520135700269592002801626650001501654650001101669650001501680700002201695700001901717700002301736700002601759773009301785856009001878990002301968852000901991655001202000IND60095825520221119041205.0141104e201305  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009582552DNAL7 a10.1016/j.combustflame.2013.01.0162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGross, Matthew L.10aCoupling micro and meso-scale combustion models of AP/HTPB propellants  ap. 982-992.  aCombustion simulations at the micro and meso-scales are coupled to give a more theoretically based and accurate description of AP (ammonium perchlorate)/HTPB (hydroxyl-terminated polybutadiene) composite propellant combustion. One and two-dimensional micro-scale combustion models of AP and AP/HTPB, which include detailed kinetics and species transport, are utilized to define semi-global kinetics for a meso-scale propellant combustion model capable of representing the complex morphology of an actual propellant. The AP/HTPB flame structure predicted with the micro-scale models is separated into four flames. Each flame is represented with a single reaction, thus a new four-step kinetic mechanism is implemented into the meso-scale model. Physical and kinetic parameters are determined with the micro-scale models. The meso-scale model is calibrated and validated with the micro-scale models to ensure the correct flame structure, as a function of pressure and AP particle sizes, is recreated with the four-step mechanism. The primary focus of this work is to outline the methodology used to couple the two numerical scales. Results of the meso-scale model are compared with the previous empirically-parameterized meso-scale model results and experimental data. Predictions are within 10% of experimental values for a range of AP/HTPB propellants.  aPublisher supplied data 3acombustion 3amodels 3aprediction1 aHedman, Trevor D.1 aSon, Steven F.1 aJackson, Thomas L.1 aBeckstead, Merrill W.0 tCombustion and Flame.g2013 May, v. 160, no. 5 p.982-992dElsevier Inc.x0010-21807nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.combustflame.2013.01.0163Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02120naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004400094040001800138100001600156245008400172300001600256520105600272592002801328650002001356650001501376650001301391650002501404650001601429650001601445650002501461700002601486700002101512700002201533773009301555856009001648990002301738852000901761655001201770IND60095825620221119041332.0141104e201305  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009582562DNAL7 a10.1016/j.combustflame.2013.01.0202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMiki, Kenji10aUsing Bayesian analysis to quantify uncertainties in the H+O₂→OH+O reaction  ap. 861-869.  aA stochastic Bayesian approach is applied to investigate the uncertainty in the rate coefficient of H+O₂→OH+O (k₁) using the latest shock-tube experimental data. We simultaneously calibrate all random variables using a recently developed stochastic simulation algorithm which allows for efficient sampling in the high-dimensional parameter space. We introduce the idea of “irreducible” uncertainty when considering other parameters in the system. Nine stochastic models are constructed depending on the choice of uncertainties, hydrogen concentration, gas temperature, pressure, and rate coefficients of other reactions. The sensitivity analysis of uncertainty in k₁ on these uncertainty parameters is performed. It is shown that the introduction of “irreducible” uncertainty does not always increase the uncertainty of k₁. In addition, we observe the high sensitivity of uncertainty in k₁ to the uncertainty in the measured time-shift. Our results show the strong temperature dependence of the uncertainty in the rate coefficient.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBayesian theory 3aalgorithms 3ahydrogen 3astochastic processes 3atemperature 3auncertainty 3auncertainty analysis1 aPrudencio, Ernesto E.1 aCheung, Sai Hung1 aTerejanu, Gabriel0 tCombustion and Flame.g2013 May, v. 160, no. 5 p.861-869dElsevier Inc.x0010-21807nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.combustflame.2013.01.0203Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02244naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006100148245011900209520109800328592002801426650002501454650002301479650002001502653003301522653001301555653002301568653001401591653001301605653001501618653001601633653001301649700002801662773011201690856008301802852000901885655001201894IND60695372520221123014021.0220606e202008  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069537252DNAL7 a10.1016/j.trac.2020.1159132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRaposo, Francisco1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1458-883210aPerformance parameters for analytical method validation: Controversies and discrepancies among numerous guidelines  aThe main objective of method validation process is to prove that an analytical method is acceptable for its intended purpose. The necessity for laboratories to use fully validated methods is now universally accepted as a way to obtain reliable results. There are diverse documents for method validation including information about different performance parameters. The classical performance characteristics are accuracy, limit of detection, precision, recovery, robustness, ruggedness, selectivity, specificity and trueness. Unfortunately, contradictory information is normally present among the method validation documents used by laboratories. The inconsistency about the performance parameters can generate some degree of confusion in the complete method validation process. This manuscript addresses controversial and discrepant information, focusing specifically on several national and international method validation guidelines published by prominent organizations and institutions which serve as guidance to validate new analytical methods by practitioners working in different fields.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanalytical chemistry 3aanalytical methods 3adetection limit 0aAnalytical method validation 0aAccuracy 0aLimit of detection 0aPrecision 0aRecovery 0aRobustness 0aSelectivity 0aTrueness1 aIbelli-Bianco, Carolina0 tTrends in analytical chemistry.g2020 Aug., v. 129 p.115913-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11800x0165-99367nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.trac.2020.1159133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03768naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094024002200132024001900154040001800173100001700191245016500208300001600373506007600389520206300465592002802528506003702556650001802593650002002611650002302631650002402654650001102678650001602689650002102705650001802726650001302744650001502757650001402772650002602786650001202812650002402824650001602848650001602864653001202880653001102892653001502903653001602918653001402934700001702948700001702965700001802982773012003000856008503120852000903205655001203214IND60535309820221207121411.0190401e20141215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053530982DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vetpar.2014.10.0032doi7 aPMC71270882pmcid7 a254585612pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPhilippe, P.10aComparative efficacy of diclazuril (Vecoxan®) and toltrazuril (Baycox bovis®) against natural infections of Eimeria bovis and Eimeria zuernii in French calves  ap. 129-137.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aA blinded, randomized, controlled, multi-centric field study was conducted on French dairy farms (n=9) to evaluate the long term efficacy of metaphylactic, single oral treatments with either 1mg/kg body weight (BW) of diclazuril (Vecoxan®), or 15mg/kg BW of toltrazuril (Baycox®) against natural infections with Eimeria zuernii and/or Eimeria bovis, compared to untreated control animals. A total of 199 calves from nine commercial farms aged between 21 and 55 days old at the start of study were included and randomly allocated to one of three groups. Calves on all farms were observed for a period of 78 days post treatment, using both parasitological (oocyst excretion), and clinical parameters (faecal score and body weight). The assessment of efficacy was based on both control of oocyst excretion, and on the average daily weight gains throughout the study.During the whole study period, the mean number of days with diarrhoea (≥2) was similar (0.7 days) between treated groups. Excretion in the untreated group peaked at 21 days after treatment. In both the diclazuril and toltrazuril-treated groups, mean oocyst excretion decreased dramatically in the five days following treatment. Thereafter, particularly towards the end of the study period, oocyst counts and percentage levels of E. zuernii were highest in the toltrazuril-treated group. In pooled data from all trial sites, the average daily weight gain was significantly (p=0.01) higher (+0.057kg/day) in the diclazuril group when compared to the toltrazuril group, and the average body weight gain of the diclazuril treated group was 4.4kg higher than the toltrazuril group. On eight of the nine trial sites, the average daily gain was greater in the diclazuril group than in the toltrazuril group. This study demonstrates that, over an extended observation period of 78 days, metaphylactic treatment with both diclazuril and toltrazuril reduces the impact of coccidiosis, but greater performance benefits based on average daily weight gains, were achieved following the use of diclazuril.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aEimeria bovis 3aEimeria zuernii 3aaverage daily gain 3abody weight changes 3acalves 3acoccidiosis 3acommercial farms 3adairy farming 3adiarrhea 3adiclazuril 3aexcretion 3afield experimentation 3aoocysts 3aoral administration 3atoltrazuril 3aweight gain 0aEimeria 0aCattle 0aDiclazuril 0aToltrazuril 0aTreatment1 aAlzieu, J.P.1 aTaylor, M.A.1 aDorchies, Ph.0 tVeterinary parasitology.g2014 Dec. 15, v. 206, no. 3-4 p.129-137dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl11815x0304-40177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vetpar.2014.10.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02642naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002000144242008500164245007700249300001600326520126700342592002801609650002301637650001701660650000901677650001601686650001501702650001101717650001501728650001601743650001601759650001901775650001301794650001501807650001201822650001001834651001101844653001801855653001501873653001901888653002301907700002101930700002201951773010001973856007802073852000902151655001202160IND60680986020221121043627.0200117e20191231xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068098602DNAL7 a10.2478/boku-2019-00162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMartinov, Milan10aPotenziale von Ernterückständen – Eine Fallstudie für die Provinz Wojwodina10aPotentials of crops residues – A case study for the province Vojvodina  ap. 181-188.  aCrop residues are targeted as energy sources and feedstock for diverse products. A six-year lasting investigation, aiming to determine the yield potentials of crop residues of mostly grown field crops wheat, soybean and corn in the province Vojvodina (Serbia), was performed. The three levels of potentials were distinguished: theoretical, technical and sustainable. Two seasonal weather conditions were distinguished – common and dry, and their impact on the biomass yield was analyzed. The yields were expressed as absolute and relative to grain yield since the grain yield is always measured, and is available in national statistics. During common seasons, technical potentials were about 56% for wheat, 45% for soybean and 41 or 51% for the two considered corn stover collection procedures. For dry seasons, the technical potential of all considered crops was reduced to between 30 and 50%. On field remained aboveground residual biomass and its relative (to grain) amount, which was between 43 and 60%, was defined. It was concluded that the defining of sustainable potentials is a very complex task. Besides the aforementioned, measures aimed to preserve soil fertility, some overlooked issues in the literature and practice were listed and commented on.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiomass production 3acase studies 3acorn 3acorn stover 3adry season 3aenergy 3afeedstocks 3afield crops 3agrain yield 3asoil fertility 3asoybeans 3astatistics 3aweather 3awheat 3aSerbia 0aCrop residues 0apotentials 0asustainability 0aprovince Vojvodina1 aDjatkov, Djordje1 aViskovic, Miodrag0 tDie Bodenkultur.g2019 Dec. 31, v. 70, no. 3 p.181-188dSciendowJournal:14415x0006-54717nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2478/boku-2019-00163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02255naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002700152245007800179300001600257520089000273592002801163650001601191650002201207650001901229650001501248650001901263650001801282650002201300650002001322650001401342650002801356650001701384650001801401650001301419650001401432650001901446650002001465700001601485700001801501700002201519700001901541773014101560856008701701852000901788655001201797IND60608928220221121033639.0200511e20120101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060892822DNAL7 a10.1080/14620316.2012.115128512doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLakshmana Reddy, D.

Six miRNAs were identified in Solanum melongena (brinjal, eggplant) using bioinformatic methods from 98,089 EST sequences. Sixty-one potential mRNA targets were identified by homology searches of all six identified miRNAs against the Arabidopsis mRNA dataset using on-line miRU software (http://www.mirbase.org). The newly-identified miRNAs were studied further to compare their level of conservation with respect other family members. Later, the core promoter found in all targeted genes was identified and a highly-conserved GNAA motif with a critical role in the biogenesis of miRNAs was identified. The findings from this study will be useful for further research on the features of miRNAs and their mechanisms of gene regulation in S. melongena.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArabidopsis 3aSolanum melongena 3aabiotic stress 3abiogenesis 3abioinformatics 3abiotechnology 3acomputer software 3adata collection 3aeggplants 3aexpressed sequence tags 3ahorticulture 3amessenger RNA 3amicroRNA 3apathogens 3aplant response 3astress response1 aRadhika, V.1 aBharadwaj, A.1 aKhandagale, K.

As a main parameter, the evolution of protein solubilization during 4 h of proteolysis was evaluated. The enzymes alcalase, esperase, flavourzyme, fungal protease, HT-proteolytic, papain, proteopex, and combinations of alcalase + flavourzyme, esperase + flavourzyme, HT-proteolytic + flavourzyme, and proteopex + flavourzyme were applied at concentrations of 0.60% and 1.20% of commercial product as a function of total protein. The initial pH was adjusted to 7.0 or 8.0 and the temperature was maintained at 50 °C or 60 °C according to optimal conditions for each enzyme. The proteolytic activities of the enzymes were also compared with azocasein. The hydrolysis index (HI), i.e., the rate between the maximum value and the initial amount of soluble protein was formulated to allow the comparison among treatments. Results showed that the temperature did not influence the proteolysis in the tested model. The association of alcalase + flavourzyme was shown to be more efficient than all other treatments, obtaining more than 70% of soluble protein. Fungal protease pre sented the lowest results.  aPublisher supplied data 3aenzyme activity 3afungi 3ahydrolysis 3amodels 3apH 3apapain 3apoultry meat 3aprotein content 3aproteolysis 3asolubilization 3asubtilisin 3atemperature 0aenzymes 0ahydrolysis 0asoluble proteins 0apoultry meat1 aMarques, D.

We tested the effect of position-determined solar microenvironment on olive fruit size, composition, and cellular development among positions at successive heights along both faces of N–S and E–W oriented olive hedgerows (cv. Arbequina). Total incident irradiance over the fruit growth period at each canopy position was modeled, and the relationships of all fruit parameters to irradiance and amongst each other were tested. Fruit and mesocarp weight and oil increased from canopy base to top and were linearly related to irradiance, while water content showed the opposite pattern, suggesting that priorities for distribution among different sinks are strongly influenced by irradiance level. Similar patterns of fruit size and composition in relation to irradiance were also observed among hedgerow orientations. Endocarp weight and composition varied little among irradiance levels, reflecting the conservative nature of this tissue as an active sink. Greater fruit size, mesocarp weight, and oil in positions of higher irradiance, even when fruit number was higher, indicating that those yield components were primarily affected by source supply and not limited by sink competition. Fruit exposed to light developed larger mesocarp cells than shaded fruit but cell number was not affected, and mesocarp oil content was highly associated with mesocarp cell size.  aPublisher supplied data 3acanopy 3aendocarp 3afruiting 3alight intensity 3alipid content 3amesocarp 3aoils 3aolives 3aorchards 3awater content 3ayield components 0aOlea europaea L. 0aMesocarp 0aEndocarp 0aCell size 0aOil concentration 0aWater concentration1 aGómez-del-Campo, María1 aRapoport, Hava F.0 tScientia horticulturae.g2016 Jan. 26, v. 198 p.284-293dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4108x0304-42387nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scienta.2015.11.0403Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02845naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003700092040001800129100002700147245010700174300001600281520147900297592002801776650002201804650001801826650002601844650002601870650001501896650002101911650002101932650001701953650002001970650001101990650001402001650001502015650002202030650001002052650001202062650002502074650002502099650002002124650001302144700002502157700002102182773008002203856008302283852000902366655001202375IND4470693420221122232103.0150812e201210  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447069342DNAL7 a10.1016/j.appet.2012.05.0192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMulvaney-Day, Norah E.10aEating on the run. A qualitative study of health agency and eating behaviors among fast food employees  ap. 357-363.  aUnderstanding the relationship between obesity and fast food consumption encompasses a broad range of individual level and environmental factors. One theoretical approach, the health capability framework, focuses on the complex set of conditions allowing individuals to be healthy. This qualitative study aimed to identify factors that influence individual level health agency with respect to healthy eating choices in uniformly constrained environments (e.g., fast food restaurants). We used an inductive qualitative research design to develop an interview guide, conduct open-ended interviews with a purposive sample of 14 student fast food workers (aged 18–25), and analyze the data. Data analysis was conducted iteratively during the study with multiple coders to identify themes. Emergent themes included environmental influences on eating behaviors (time, cost, restaurant policies, social networks) and internal psychological factors (feelings associated with hunger, food knowledge versus food preparation know-how, reaction to physical experiences, perceptions of food options, delayed gratification, and radical subjectivity). A localized, embedded approach to analyzing the factors driving the obesity epidemic is needed. Addressing contextual interactions between internal psychological and external environmental factors responds to social justice and public health concerns, and may yield more relevant and effective interventions for vulnerable communities.  aPublisher supplied data 3adisease outbreaks 3aeating habits 3aenvironmental factors 3afast food restaurants 3afast foods 3afood consumption 3afood preparation 3ahealthy diet 3ahuman resources 3ahunger 3aingestion 3ainterviews 3aissues and policy 3alabor 3aobesity 3apsychosocial factors 3aqualitative analysis 3asocial networks 3astudents1 aWomack, Catherine A.1 aOddo, Vanessa M.0 tAppetite.g2012 Oct., v. 59, no. 2 p.357-363dElsevier Ltdx0195-66637nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.appet.2012.05.0193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03627naa a2200685 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002200150245009800172300001600270520178300286592002802069650002802097650001102125650001302136650001202149650001802161650002002179650001202199650001102211650000902222650001802231650001102249650001402260650001302274650000902287650001102296650001702307650000902324650001902333650001002352650000902362650000902371651001202380653002002392653002002412653001702432653001202449653001102461653001302472700002302485700002502508700002402533700001802557700002202575700001802597700002002615700001802635700002502653700001902678700001702697700001602714773010502730856008502835852000902920655001202929IND60628306620221120201107.0190328e201903  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062830662DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envint.2018.12.0272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEttler, Vojtéch,10aOral bioaccessibility of metal(loid)s in dust materials from mining areas of northern Namibia  ap. 205-215.  aOre mining and processing in semi-arid areas is responsible for the generation of metal(loid)-containing dust, which is easily transported by wind to the surrounding environment. To assess the human exposure to dust-derived metal(loid)s (As, Cd, Cu, Pb, Sb, Zn), as well as the potential risks related to incidental dust ingestion, we studied mine tailing dust (n = 8), slag dust (n = 5) and smelter dust (n = 4) from old mining and smelting sites in northern Namibia (Kombat, Berg Aukas, Tsumeb). In vitro bioaccessibility testing using extraction in simulated gastric fluid (SGF) was combined with determination of grain-size distributions, chemical and mineralogical characterizations and leaching tests conducted on original dust samples and separated PM10 fractions. The bulk and bioaccessible concentrations of the metal(loid)s were ranked as follows: mine tailing dusts < slag dusts ≪ smelter dusts. Extremely high As and Pb bioaccessibilities in the smelter dusts were caused by the presence of highly soluble phases such as arsenolite (As2O3) and various metal-arsenates unstable under the acidic conditions of SGF. The exposure estimates calculated for an adult person of 70 kg at a dust ingestion rate of 50 mg/day indicated that As, Pb (and also Cd to a lesser extent) grossly exceeded tolerable daily intake limits for these contaminants in the case of slag and smelter dusts. The high risk for smelter dusts has been acknowledged, and the safety measures currently adopted by the smelter operator in Tsumeb are necessary to reduce the staff's exposure to contaminated dust. The exposure risk for the local population is only important at the unfenced disposal sites at Berg Aukas, where the PM10 exhibited high levels of bioaccessible Pb.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacceptable daily intake 3aadults 3aantimony 3aarsenic 3aarsenic oxide 3abioavailability 3acadmium 3acopper 3adust 3agastric juice 3ahumans 3aingestion 3aleaching 3alead 3amining 3aparticulates 3arisk 3asemiarid zones 3aslags 3awind 3azinc 3aNamibia 0aDust mineralogy 0aBioacessibility 0aMetal(loid)s 0aNamibia 0aMining 0aSmelting1 aCihlová, Markéta1 aJarošíková, Alice1 aMihaljevič, Martin1 aDrahota, Petr1 aKříbek, Bohdan,1 aVaněk, Aleš1 aPenížek, Vít1 aSracek, Ondra1 aKlementová, Mariana1 aEngel, Zbyněk1 aKamona, Fred1 aMapani, Ben0 tEnvironment international.g2019 Mar., v. 124 p.205-215dElsevier LtdwJournal:6374x0160-41207nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envint.2018.12.0273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02510naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001900145245009100164300001600255500001500271520114200286592002801428650002101456650001801477650001301495650002101508650002101529650002101550650001201571650003901583650002701622650001401649650001201663650005801675650002201733650002001755650001401775653001401789700001701803700002101820700001901841700001901860773010401879856004801983852000902031655001202040IND4463744420221120210248.0120727e201202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446374442DNAL7 a10.1007/s11947-009-0303-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Youwei,10aIsolation and Characterization of Chickpea (Cicer arietinum L.)

The protein isolates were characterized by Native PAGE, sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) and electrospray-ionization mass spectrometry (ESI/MS). Both the isoelectric precipitate and cryoprecipitate contained the globulin protein 11S legumins and 7S vicilins as the major protein fractions and 2S albumin proteins as a minor protein fraction. The major subunits of RP-HPLC protein fractions from both cryoprecipitate and isoelectric precipitate were found to contain subunits of both legumins and vicilins. SDS-PAGE identified legumin α-subunits with MW 40.6 and 39.5 kDa and legumin β- subunits with MW 23.5 and 22.5 kDa, and vicilin subunits with MW 70.2, 50.7, 35.0, 33.6, 18.9 and 15.5 kDa.

For this purpose, some legal aspects are presented by way of example that are involved in operating a biobank (data protection, personal rights, consent, protection against seizure, etc.). The authors then discuss a draft law from 2010 which, however, was rejected by parliamentary committees on the grounds that there was no need for legislating this issue. This is then followed by the description of a second attempt to create a biobank law, which was undertaken by a group of professors from Augsburg and Munich in 2015. Again, the authors conclude that there is no acute need for such a law. Biobanking science and practice have already given rise to regulations (guidelines, model texts, procedural rules, etc.) that create a sufficiently secure basis for bio-banking.  aPublisher supplied data 0abiobank 0aBiobank Act 0abiobank and ethics 0abiobanking legislation 0adata protection 0adraft laws 0alegal aspects1 aScheller, Jürgen,0 tJournal of laboratory medicine.g2019 Dec. 18, v. 43, no. 6 p.311-315dDe GruyterwJournal:27086x2567-94497nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1515/labmed-2019-00653Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03017naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024004300113040001800156100002400174245011300198300001400311520132100325592002801646650002701674650002101701650001801722650001901740650002701759650001501786650002201801650001901823650003701842650003401879650003001913650003401943650002801977650003202005650003102037650001802068650002202086650003002108650007602138650003202214650004802246700001502294773011602309856008902425852000902514655001202523IND60112723920221120193840.0141111e20121101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011272392DNAL7 a231416402pmid7 a10.1016/j.ijfoodmicro.2012.09.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKastbjerg, Vicky G.10aIndustrial disinfectants do not select for resistance in Listeria monocytogenes following long term exposure  ap. 11-15.  aListeria monocytogenes is a food-borne pathogen that can persist for years in food processing plants. It has been hypothesized that this could be due to the development of tolerance or resistance to the disinfectants used. The purpose of the present study was to determine whether biocide resistance or tolerance would evolve in L. monocytogenes under continued selection in three industrial disinfectants. L. monocytogenes EGD was exposed to Desinfect CL (hypochlorite) and Incimaxx DES (peracedic acid and hydrogen peroxide) for several hundred generations. This caused no increase in the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) to the disinfectants, whereas exposure to Triquart SUPER (quaternary ammonium compounds) caused a two- to four-fold increase in MIC. Exposure to gentamicin, which was used as a positive control, caused an 8 to 256-fold increase in MIC for several aminoglycosides. Despite the low level of tolerance, the populations adapted to Triquart SUPER were still sensitive to killing with this disinfectant at 0.0125%, which is much lower than in-use concentrations (1–5%). Our data are in agreement with the fact that finding strains with high acquired resistance to disinfectants is rare, and that the disinfectants are still efficient for controlling microorganisms such as L. monocytogenes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aListeria monocytogenes 3achronic exposure 3adisinfectants 3afood pathogens 3afood processing plants 3agentamicin 3ahydrogen peroxide 3amicroorganisms 3aminimum inhibitory concentration 3aquaternary ammonium compounds 2aAdaptation, Physiological 2aAminoglycosidesxpharmacology 2aColony Count, Microbial 2aDisinfectantsxpharmacology 2aDrug Resistance, Bacterial 2aFood Handling 2aFood Microbiology 2aGentamicinsxpharmacology 2aListeria monocytogenesxdrug effectsxgrowth & developmentxphysiology. 2aMicrobial Sensitivity Tests 2aQuaternary Ammonium Compoundsxpharmacology1 aGram, Lone0 tInternational journal of food microbiology.g2012 Nov. 1, v. 160, no. 1 p.11-15dElsevier B.V.x0168-16057nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijfoodmicro.2012.09.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03514naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245011800168300001400286520199600300592002802296650001902324650001302343650001302356650001602369650001102385650001902396650001102415650001402426650002402440650002102464650001002485650001702495650001102512650000902523650001202532650001602544653001802560653001202578653002502590653001402615653002302629653001202652700001902664700005902683700002302742700002202765773010302787856008502890852000902975655001202984IND60628306820221120201114.0190328e201903  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062830682DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envint.2018.12.0452doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCakmak, Sabit10aExposure to traffic and mortality risk in the 1991–2011 Canadian Census Health and Environment Cohort (CanCHEC)  ap. 16-24.  aThere is evidence that local traffic density and living near major roads can adversely affect health outcomes. We aimed to assess the relationship between local road length, proximity to primary highways, and cause-specific mortality in the 1991 Canadian Census Health and Environment Cohort (CanCHEC). In this long-term study of 2.6 million people, based on completion of the long-form census in 1991 and followed until 2011, we used annual residential addresses to determine the total length of local roads within 200 m of postal code representative points and the postal code's distance to primary highways. The association between exposure to traffic and cause-specific non-accidental mortality was estimated using Cox proportional hazards models, adjusting for individual covariates and contextual factors, including census division-level proportion in high school, the percentage of recent immigrants, and neighborhood income. We performed sensitivity analyses, including adjustment for exposure to PM2.5, NO2, or O3, restricting to subjects in core urban areas, and spatial variation by climatic zone. The hazard ratio (HR) for all non-accidental mortality associated with an interquartile increase in length of local roads was 1.05 (95% CI 1.04, 1.05), while for an interquartile range increase in proximity to primary highways, the HR was 1.03 (95% CI 1.02, 1.04). HRs by traffic quartile increased with increasing lengths of local roads, as well as with closer proximity to primary highways, for all mortality causes. The associations were stronger within subjects' resident in urban core areas, attenuated by adjustment for PM2.5, and HRs showed limited spatial variation by climatic zone. In the CanCHEC cohort, exposure to higher road density and proximity to major traffic roads was associated with increased mortality risk from cerebrovascular and cardiovascular disease, ischemic heart disease, COPD, respiratory disease, and lung cancer, with unclear results for diabetes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclimatic zones 3adiabetes 3ahighways 3aimmigration 3aincome 3alung neoplasms 3amodels 3amortality 3amyocardial ischemia 3anitrogen dioxide 3aozone 3aparticulates 3apeople 3arisk 3atraffic 3aurban areas 0aAir pollution 0aTraffic 0aEnvironmental health 0aMortality 0aRespiratory health 0aClimate1 aHebbern, Chris1 aVanos, Jennifer1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1854-90961 aCrouse, Dan Lawson1 aTjepkema, Michael0 tEnvironment international.g2019 Mar., v. 124 p.16-24dElsevier LtdwJournal:6374x0160-41207nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envint.2018.12.0453Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02259naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002200146245014500168300001600313500001400329520078400343592002801127650002101155650002801176650001301204650003001217650000901247650003101256650001601287650001501303650001801318650001001336650000901346650001401355653002301369653001501392653002401407653002301431653002401454700001701478700002101495700002701516700001901543700003501562773007901597856008001676852000901756655001201765IND60711056620221120092158.0200916s2004    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071105662DNAL7 a10.1163/15685410428434412doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStruck, Elisabeth10aInteractions between host plants, the subterranean burrower bug, Cyrtomenus bergi, and the entomopathogenic nematode Heterorhabditis megidis  ap. 633-639.  aNAL-light  aInteractions between seedlings of Zea mays L. as a host plant, the subterranean burrower bug, Cyrtomenus bergi Froeschner, as a pest, and Heterorhabditis megidis Poinar, an entomopathogenic nematode, as a biological control agent, were studied, with a particular emphasis on the host finding behaviour of the nematode.

A study was conducted to determine the effects of dried broccoli floret (DBF) on egg production parameters, egg quality and apparent nutrient digestibility of laying hens. It was hypothesised that feeding DBF can improve egg quality without adversely affecting layer performance.2. Seventy-two White Leghorn layers aged 62 weeks were randomly allotted to 4 dietary treatments (6 cage replicates with 3 hens each) and fed diets containing 0, 40, 80 and 120 g/kg DBF in feed for 56 d.3. Inclusion of DBF had no effect on feed intake, egg production, feed conversion ratio or egg components. However, egg weight increased (linear effect, P < 0.05) as the level of DBF in the diet increased. Egg breakage strength, eggshell strength and Haugh unit were not influenced by dietary treatments. Egg yolk colour (quadratic effect, P = 0.002) and α-tocopherol concentration (quadratic effect, P < 0.0001) improved as a result of DBF inclusion. Egg yolk cholesterol concentration was not altered by DBF inclusion. Apparent total tract nutrient (dry matter, organic matter and crude protein) digestibility coefficients decreased (linear effect, P < 0.05) as the level of DBF increased.4. Feeding DBF to layers up to 120 g/kg of the diet had no negative effects on feed intake, egg production and feed efficiency and improved egg yolk colour and α-tocopherol concentration. However, total tract nutrient digestibility coefficients were negatively decreased as a result of DBF inclusion.  aThis work was supported by the Ministère de l’Agriculture, des Pêcheries et de l’Alimentation du Québec (MAPAQ): [Grant Number 311015].  aPublisher supplied data  aGrant Number 311015cMinistère de l’Agriculture, des Pêcheries et de l’Alimentation du Québec (MAPAQ)dhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100008777 3aWhite Leghorn 3aalpha-tocopherol 3abroccoli 3acages 3acholesterol 3acrude protein 3adiet 3adigestibility 3aegg production 3aegg shell 3aegg weight 3aegg yolk color 3aeggs 3afeed conversion 3afeed intake 3aflorets 3alaying hens 3aorganic matter 3apoultry feeding 0aBroccoli floret residues 0aegg yolk α-tocopherol and cholesterol 0alayer performance 0atotal tract digestibility1 aBaurhoo, B.0 tBritish poultry science.g2018 July 4, v. 59, no. 4 p.430-434dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl45506x1466-17997nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00071668.2018.14604593Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02970naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002200151245013200173300001600305520164700321592002801968650001601996650002002012650004102032650001002073650003202083650002102115650002302136653002102159653001402180653000902194653002302203653003402226653001902260700002802279700001802307700002002325700001502345773009302360856008602453852000902539655001202548IND60628958820221119050455.0201125e20180901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062895882DNAL7 a10.1016/j.talanta.2018.05.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAparicio-Ruiz, R.10aComparison of two analytical methods validated for the determination of volatile compounds in virgin olive oil: GC-FID vs GC-MS  ap. 133-141.  aThe utility of volatile compounds to explain virgin olive oil aroma descriptors is fully accepted and demanded by the olive oil sector. However, the methodology, and particularly the kind of detector to be used, is a matter of discussion because the high number of volatiles and their different nature. The SPME-GC-MS method has recently been validated for the most relevant volatiles but SPME-GC-FID method still needs to be validated to evaluate its performance in this application. A comparison between these two GC methods in determining 26 volatiles has been carried out in terms of analytical quality parameters (repeatability, intermediate precision, calibration curves, limits of detection and quantification, linear working ranges, selectivity and sensitivity). Good selectivity, linearity and higher upper values of the working range are the main advantages of SPME-GC-FID versus low bottom values of working ranges, better sensitivity and lower limits of detection and quantification of SPME-GC-MS. The limit of blank associated to each individual volatile was also determined and it allowed perfecting the empirical limit of detection. This procedure was carried out for SPME-GC-FID, which resulted in 21 volatiles with empirical limits of detections lower than their odor thresholds, and hence they can be used as markers of virgin olive oil sensory descriptors. Finally, with all the analytical quality parameters checked, a practical example of the ability of the volatiles quantified by SPME-GC-FID to discriminate the different categories (extra-virgin, virgin and lampante) and their main aroma descriptors is also provided.  aPublisher supplied data 3acalibration 3adetection limit 3agas chromatography-mass spectrometry 3aodors 3asolid phase microextraction 3avirgin olive oil 3avolatile compounds 0aVirgin olive oil 0aVolatiles 0aSPME 0aGas chromatography 0aAnalytical quality parameters 0aOdor threshold1 aGarcía-González, D.L.1 aMorales, M.T.1 aLobo-Prieto, A.1 aRomero, I.0 tTalanta.g2018 Sept. 01, v. 187 p.133-141dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11742x0039-91407nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.talanta.2018.05.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02430naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245012700164300001600291520098200307592002801289650002101317650001001338650001201348650001201360650002101372650001401393650002801407650002801435650002201463650003401485653002301519653002901542653001001571653002901581653002301610700002801633700006601661700005701727773012201784856008101906852000901987655001201996IND60644855920221118121427.0200804e201908  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064485592DNAL7 a10.1016/j.lwt.2019.05.0842doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKumar, Vikas10aEffects of high pressure processing (HPP) and acid pre-treatment on quality attributes of hilsa (Tenualosa ilisha) fillets  ap. 647-652.  aThe present study evaluated high pressure processing (HPP) effects on the quality attributes of acid pre-treated hilsa (Tenualosa ilisha) fillets. The acid pre-treatment was done by dipping the dressed fillet in potassium sorbate (0.01%, 0.05% and 0.10% (w/v)) solution for 5 min. Samples were pressurized at 100–300 MPa for 10 min at 30 °C. HPP treatment significantly (P < 0.05) affected the total color difference (ΔE) and textural attributes of acid pre-treated fillets. The HPP treatment significantly (P < 0.05) improved the microbiological quality of fillets. HPP and acid pre-treatment also resulted in lower (P < 0.05) TVB-N and TMA-N values. Free fatty acid contents at higher pressure and higher acid level were significantly (P < 0.05) higher than samples treated at lower pressure level. HPP treatment at lower pressure level improved the acceptability of acid pre-treated fillets in terms of freshness and microbiological properties.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTenualosa ilisha 3acolor 3adipping 3afillets 3afree fatty acids 3afreshness 3ahigh pressure treatment 3amicrobiological quality 3apotassium sorbate 3atotal volatile basic nitrogen 0aAcid pre-treatment 0aHigh pressure processing 0aHilsa 0aMicrobiological property 0aQuality attributes1 aRao, Pavuluri Srinivasa1 aPurohit, Soumya Ranjan1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1589-58231 aKumar, Yogesh1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2688-58930 tLebensmittel-Wissenschaft + Technologie.g2019 Aug., v. 111 p.647-652dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl1644x0023-64387nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lwt.2019.05.0843Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01742naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002000152245008200172300001400254520065600268592002800924650002600952650004900978650001101027650001001038650000901048650003101057650001401088650001801102650001401120650001701134650001101151700001801162773010401180856008701284852000901371655001201380IND60611963320221119142926.0190401e201810  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061196332DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jtherbio.2018.08.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKhmelinskii, I.10aEPR hyperthermia of S. cerevisiae using superparamagnetic Fe3O4 nanoparticles  ap. 55-61.  aPresently we communicate a newly developed method of resonant radiofrequency heating, applicable in hyperthermal therapy.

It is suggested that the further development of township enterprise should be an important element of China's development strategy.  aPublisher supplied data 3aarable soils 3abusiness enterprises 3aemployment 3aemployment opportunities 3aindustrialization 3alabor 3apopulation growth 3arural areas 3aChina1 aDillon, John L.1 aWan, Guang H.0 tAgricultural economics.g1992 Feb., v. 6, no. 3 p.201-215dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl41636x0169-51507nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1574-0862.1992.tb00180.x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03059naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001300147245013500160300001600295520126900311592002801580650002501608650001101633650001801644650002401662650001901686650001701705650001501722650002101737650004301758650001501801650001601816653001901832653002601851653002801877653002301905653002501928653005701953653008002010653005302090653008502143700001702228700005702245700001902302700002002321773012202341856008102463852000902544655001202553IND60644856120221118122140.0200804e201908  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064485612DNAL7 a10.1016/j.lwt.2019.05.0862doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Qing10aAntioxidant activity of free and hydrolyzed phenolic compounds in soluble and insoluble dietary fibres derived from hulless barley  ap. 534-540.  aPhenolic compounds associated with dietary fibre are present in free, soluble conjugated and insoluble-bound forms. In this study, total soluble, free, esterified, etherified and insoluble-bound phenolic fractions were extracted from the insoluble dietary fibre (IDF) and soluble dietary fibre (SDF) of hulless barley. Total phenolic content (TPC), total flavonoid content (TFC) and antioxidant activities of five phenolic fractions of IDF and SDF were evaluated. Major phenolic acids and flavonoids were analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography. The results revealed that the TPC and TFC of five phenolic fractions of IDF were 2.42–7.33 and 3.08–10.00 times, respectively, which were higher than those in SDF. Insoluble-bound phenolic fractions had the highest TPC and TFC among the five phenolic fractions. A significant positive linear correlation between TPC and antioxidant activity was observed in each of the five phenolic fractions from IDF and SDF (P < 0.05). Furthermore, ferulic acid was an abundant phenolic compound in total soluble and insoluble-bound phenolic fractions among IDF and SDF. This study indicates that IDF and SDF are rich in phenolic compounds which can be considered as functional food ingredients or nutraceuticals.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantioxidant activity 3abarley 3adietary fiber 3adietary supplements 3aesterification 3aferulic acid 3aflavonoids 3afunctional foods 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3ahydrolysis 3aingredients 0aHulless barley 0aSoluble dietary fibre 0aInsoluble dietary fibre 0aPhenolic compounds 0aAntioxidant activity 0a2,2-Diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (PubChem CID: 2735032) 0a6-hydroxy-2,5,7,8-tetramethylchroman-2-carboxylic acid (PubChem CID: 40634) 0a2,4,6-tripyridyl-s-triazine (PubChem CID: 77258) 0a2,2′- azinobis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (PubChem CID: 16240279)1 aYang, Shihua1 aLi, Yongqiang1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5675-22341 aHuang, Yonghua1 aZhang, Jianping0 tLebensmittel-Wissenschaft + Technologie.g2019 Aug., v. 111 p.534-540dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl1644x0023-64387nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lwt.2019.05.0863Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02314naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245011800168300002000286520065000306592002800956596009800984596008901082596012801171650001401299650002601313650002001339650002601359650001201385653003401397653002901431653001201460653001401472653001901486700001801505700005501523700001701578700005501595773014701650856008601797852000901883655001201892IND60787266420221116205114.0220808e20220725xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078726642DNAL7 a10.1021/acssuschemeng.2c023932doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Kaili10aSelective Hydrogenolysis of 5-Hydroxymethylfurfural into 2,5-Dimethylfuran under Mild Conditions Using Pd/MOF-808  ap. 10286-10293.  a2,5-Dimethylfuran (DMF) is an important candidate for liquid fuels, which can be produced from biomass-derived 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (5-HMF). Efficient catalysts for selective hydrogenolysis of HMF to DMF under mild conditions without any additives are highly desired. Herein, we designed and prepared a Zr-based metal–organic framework (MOF-808) supported Pd catalyst (Pd/MOF-808), which can efficiently catalyze the hydrogenolysis of HMF to DMF with a yield of 99% under 100 °C without any additives. In addition, the Pd/MOF-808 catalyst also showed good reusability, with the capability of being used five times without loss of activity.  aPublisher supplied data  a22073105cNational Natural Science Foundation of Chinadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100001809  aQYZDY-SSW-SLH013cChinese Academy of Sciencesdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100002367  a2017YFA0403103cMinistry of Science and Technology of the People's Republic of Chinadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100002855 3acatalysts 3acoordination polymers 3agreen chemistry 3ahydroxymethylfurfural 3aliquids 0a5-Hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) 0a2,5-Dimethyl furan (DMF) 0aBiomass 0aPalladium 0aHydrogenolysis1 aMeng, Qinglei1 aWu, Haihong1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6266-82901 aHe, Mingyuan1 aHan, Buxing1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0440-809X0 tACS sustainable chemistry & engineering.g2022 July 25, v. 10, no. 31 p.10286-10293dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23317x2168-04857nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acssuschemeng.2c023933Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03323naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002700111040001800138100002300156245009600179300002000275520168900295592002801984650002502012650001702037650001402054650001802068650001402086650001602100650001802116650002802134650001402162650001902176650001702195650001402212650001502226650004102241650002402282650004102306650001402347650001102361650002302372650001502395653002302410653002602433653001902459653004102478700002002519700002302539773013502562852000902697856007502706655001202781IND4477909220160905000000.0160905e20131030xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447790922DNAL7 a240936632pmid7 a10.1021/jf402523k2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aÇelik, Ecem Evrim10aSoluble Antioxidant Compounds Regenerate the Antioxidants Bound to Insoluble Parts of Foods  ap. 10329-10334.  aThis study aimed to investigate the regeneration potential of antioxidant capacity of an insoluble food matrix. Investigations were performed in vitro with several food matrices rich in dietary fiber (DF) and bound antioxidants. After removal of the soluble fraction, the antioxidant capacity (AC) of the insoluble fraction was measured by the QUENCHER procedure using ABTS•⁺ or DPPH• radicals. After measurement, the insoluble residue was washed out to remove the excess of radicals and treated with pure antioxidant solution or antioxidant-rich beverage to regenerate depleted antioxidants on the fiber. Results revealed that the antioxidant capacity of compounds chemically bound to the insoluble moiety could be reconstituted in the presence of other hydrogen-donating substances in the liquid phase. Regeneration efficiency was found to range between 21.5 and 154.3% depending on the type of insoluble food matrix and regeneration agent. Among the food matrices studied, cereal products were found to have slightly higher regeneration efficiency, whereas antioxidant-rich beverages were more effective than pure antioxidants as regeneration agents. Taking wheat bran as reference insoluble material, the regeneration abilities of beverages were in the following order: green tea > espresso coffee > black tea > instant coffee > orange juice > red wine. These results highlighted the possible physiological relevance of antioxidants bound to the insoluble food material in the gastrointestinal tract. During the digestion process they could react with the free radicals and at the same time they can be regenerated by other soluble antioxidant compounds present in the meal.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantioxidant activity 3aantioxidants 3ablack tea 3adietary fiber 3adigestion 3afood matrix 3afree radicals 3agastrointestinal system 3agreen tea 3ainstant coffee 3aorange juice 3ared wines 3awheat bran 2aAntioxidantsxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aBeveragesxanalysis 2aEdible Grainxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aDigestion 2aHumans 2aModels, Biological 2aSolubility 0abound antioxidants 0ainsoluble food matrix 0adietary fibers 0aregeneration of antioxidant capacity1 aGökmen, Vural,1 aFogliano, Vincenzo0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2013 Oct. 30, v. 61, no. 43 p.10329-10334dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-51187nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fjf402523k3Available from publisher's site 7aarticle04591naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001900146245015300165300001600318500001400334520308700348592002803435650001903463650002503482650001203507650001203519650001003531650000903541650001503550650001603565650001203581650002903593650001603622650001203638650000903650651001203659653000803671653001403679653000803693653001403701653001103715653000903726653001403735653001303749700002003762700002403782700002403806700002003830700001903850773007903869856008003948852000904028655001204037IND60711057020221120092611.0200916s2004    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071105702DNAL7 a10.1163/15685410428435772doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTrinh, Phap Q.10aRadopholus arabocoffeae sp. n. (Nematoda: Pratylenchidae), a nematode pathogenic to Coffea arabica in Vietnam, and additional data on R. duriophilus  ap. 681-693.  aNAL-light  aRadopholus arabocoffeae sp. n., a new nematode pathogenic on Coffea arabica cv. Catimor, is described from Vietnam. Females of R. arabocoffeae sp. n. are characterised by the broad amphidial apertures with prominent margins. Males are characterised by the bursa extending to one third, rarely middle, of the tail. The new species belongs to the group of species with a long tail in the female. Radopholus arabocoffeae sp. n. is easily distinguished from R. similis by the bursa reaching to only one third of the tail vs extending to the tail terminus. Radopholus arabocoffeae sp. n. is differentiated from R. bridgei by the lateral field having three bands of equal width (vs middle one narrower than others), lateral field completely areolated over whole body vs not areolated except irregularly in neck and tail, hemizonid distinct vs indistinct, four lateral field incisures terminating far behind phasmid vs three incisures terminating at or just behind phasmid, lateral lines fusing at two thirds of tail vs fusing at one third of tail, longer spicule length (18-21 vs 15.5-18.0 μm), and male bursa usually extending to only one third of tail vs mid tail. Radopholus arabocoffeae sp. n. differs from R. colbrani by the rod-like vs round sperm, spicule length (18-21 vs 13-16 μm), tail length to stylet ratio (4.1-4.9 vs more than 5.1) and presence vs absence of a bursa. Radopholus arabocoffeae sp. n. differs from R. duriophilus by the rod-like vs kidney-shaped sperm. Males further differ from R. duriophilus by shorter stylet length (8.2-11.6 vs 11.5-15 μm), smaller distance between dorsal pharyngeal gland orifice and stylet base (1.7-3.4 vs 4-9.5 μm), shorter hyaline tail (2.6-3.4 vs 4-9.5 μm), and bursa extending to one third of tail vs mid-tail. Female R. arabocoffeae sp. n. differ from R. duriophilus by the broad amphidial aperture with prominent margin present vs absent. Males of R. arabocoffeae sp. n. differ from R. musicola by the rudimentary and amalgamated stylet base (vs with knobs), and inner lateral lines fusing at two thirds of the tail vs just posterior to the phasmid. The high level of ITS-rDNA sequence divergence of R. arabocoffeae sp. n. from other Radopholus spp. and the presence of nucleotide autapomorphies support a separate specific status of this new species. On carrot disks, the two species reproduced from 15-30°C; optimum reproduction occurring at 28°C. The reproductive capacity of R. duriophilus was higher than that of R. arabocoffeae sp. n. Radopholus duriophilus reproduced from single juveniles; R. arabocoffeae sp. n. did not. The correlation between initial densities of Pratylenchus coffeae, R. duriophilus and R. arabocoffeae sp. n. and the weight of C. arabica cv. Catimor fitted the Seinhorst model Y = ym for Pi ≥ T, and Y = ym ˙ m + ym(1–m)z(Pi–T). Coffea arabica cv. Catimor was very susceptible for to all three nematode species tested, but especially so to R. arabocoffeae sp. n. The reproductive capacity of R. arabocoffeae sp. n. on C. arabica cv. Catimor was higher than P. coffeae or R. duriophilus.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCoffea arabica 3aPratylenchus coffeae 3acarrots 3afemales 3amales 3aneck 3anematology 3anew species 3apharynx 3areproductive performance 3aspermatozoa 3astylets 3atail 3aVietnam 0aSEM 0aBIONOMICS 0aITS 0aMOLECULAR 0aCOFFEE 0aRDNA 0aPHYLOGENY 0aTAXONOMY1 aNguyen, Chau N.1 aWaeyenberge, Lieven1 aSubbotin, Sergei A.1 aKarssen, Gerrit1 aMoens, Maurice0 tNematology.g, v. 6, no. 5 p.681-693dBrillwJournal:2154x1388-55457nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1163/15685410428435773Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01818naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002200150245011600172300001800288520068900306592002800995650001201023650001601035650002001051650002101071650001301092700002601105700002601131700002401157700002601181700002601207700003001233773011001263856008601373852000901459655001201468IND60530396520170410000000.0160721e20160517xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053039652DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.analchem.6b000722doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSilva, Thalita

Another invader, the benthic fish round goby (Neogobius melanostomus), is morphologically adapted to feed on dreissenids and likely affects dreissenid populations; however, the degree of this predatory effect is variable. In 2009 and 2010, we examined round goby abundances, size distributions, diet contents, and diet selectivity in Saginaw Bay, Lake Huron; a shallow bay that has been subjected to numerous anthropogenic stressors. We further used a consumption model to estimate dreissenid consumption by three different size classes of round goby. Round gobies were found throughout the bay and most were smaller than 80mm total length. Round gobies of all sizes consumed dreissenids (including fish as small as 30mm total length), though dreissenids were rarely preferred. The relative proportion of dreissenids (by biomass) present in diets of round gobies increased with fish size, but also throughout the year for all size classes. Despite this, overall consumptive effects of round gobies on dreissenids in Saginaw Bay were low. Many dreissenids present in the bay were larger than those consumed by round gobies. Bioenergetics-based model estimates suggest that the smallest round gobies are responsible for the majority of dreissenid consumption. While our findings are limited to soft substrates and influenced by sampling restrictions, our study design allowed us to put bounds on our estimates based upon these multiple sources of uncertainty.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDreissenidae 3aNeogobius melanostomus 3aanthropogenic stressors 3abiomass 3adiet 3aecosystems 3aexperimental design 3afish 3amodels 3amussels 3auncertainty 3aLake Huron 0aDiet 0aSelectivity 0aGreat Lakes 0aConsumption 0aAquatic invasive species 0aUncertainty1 aAndree, Sara R.1 aPothoven, Steven A.1 aNalepa, T.

The aim of this study was to investigate which nest heights are preferred by laying hens in the absence of familiar nest locations and whether preferred nest heights are more attractive than a familiar location. In two experiments, a total of 108 hens of four different layer breeds, which were at least 50 weeks of age, were studied. 2. In the first experiment, hens were given individual free choice between nests for 1-week at four different heights (0 cm, 39 cm, 78 cm, and 117 cm above ground). Hens of the four breeds differed in their nest height preferences (P = 0.0013). However, hens of three breeds preferred ground level nests (P < 0.007) and the fourth line showed an equal preference for the ground level and level three, the latter level corresponding to the height of the nests in their home compartments. 4. In the second experiment, hens from the four breeds were given a choice between ground level nests and nests at a familiar location, i.e. at the same location as in their home compartment. Hens of all strains preferred the familiar nest location (P = 0.002) and preferences did not differ between strains (P = 0.77). 5. Laying hens seem to prefer nests at ground level in the absence of a familiar nest. However, if possible, experienced 50 week old hens continue to use a familiar nest location instead of a ground nest location. The results are discussed with respect to a potential primary preference that may be modifiable by experience and with respect to possible relevance in commercial housing.  aPublisher supplied data 3achicken breeds 3alaying hens 3anesting sites 3anests 0aBreeds 0aheight 0alaying hens 0anesting 0apreferences1 aSchrader, L.0 tBritish poultry science.g2018 July 4, v. 59, no. 4 p.359-364dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl45506x1466-17997nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00071668.2018.14703183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03387naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001800152245014000170300001600310520175000326592002802076650003402104650002402138650002002162650002502182650000902207650001102216650001202227650002102239650001502260650001302275650000902288650001302297650002802310650002002338650000902358650001002367650002002377650001902397650001602416650001402432650001402446653001602460653001002476653002102486653001402507653001402521653000802535653000802543700001402551700001802565700001602583773010202599856008702701852000902788655001202797IND60539224420221122031427.0190214e201412  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053922442DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cryobiol.2014.10.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBaghshahi, H.10aAntioxidant effects of clove bud (Syzygium aromaticum) extract used with different extenders on ram spermatozoa during cryopreservation  ap. 482-487.  aClove bud (Syzygium aromaticum) extract was added at concentrations of 0, 35, 75, and 115μg/ml to ovine semen extenders in order to investigate the antioxidant activities of clove bud extract and its effects on semen quality parameters after cryopreservation of ram spermatozoa. The basic extender was composed of Tris, egg yolk, and glycerol. Two other extenders were prepared by substitution of egg yolk with either LDL or egg yolk+SDS. The DPPH inhibition test was employed to assess the antioxidant activity of clove bud extract. Results showed that, compared to vitamin E, clove bud extract had a higher antioxidant activity. Better sperm motility and movement characteristics (P<0.05) were observed in the semen diluted with medium containing egg yolk+SDS than in that containing egg yolk and LDL. Progressive motility and movement characteristics of the sperm were significantly improved (P<0.05) by adding 35 and/or 75μg/ml of clove bud extract to semen extenders. Sperm viability and plasma membrane integrity were also higher (P<0.05) in the semen exposed to medium containing egg yolk+SDS and 75μg of clove buds extract after cryopreservation processes. Higher levels of clove bud extract, however, had adverse effects on all the sperm quality parameters and significantly reduced (P<0.05) the motility, movement parameters, viability, and plasma membrane integrity of ovine sperm. It was concluded that the clove bud extract had an antioxidant potential that makes it useful for addition to semen extenders and that the best results are obtained with a maximum clove bud extract of 75μg/ml. Moreover, the combination of egg yolk and a detergent was found to improve sperm quality after the cooling and freeze–thawing processes.  aPublisher supplied data 3a2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl 3aSyzygium aromaticum 3aadverse effects 3aantioxidant activity 3abuds 3acloves 3acooling 3acryopreservation 3adetergents 3aegg yolk 3aeggs 3aglycerol 3alow density lipoprotein 3aplasma membrane 3arams 3asemen 3asemen extenders 3asperm motility 3aspermatozoa 3aviability 3avitamin E 0aAntioxidant 0aSemen 0aCryopreservation 0aClove bud 0aDetergent 0aLDL 0aRam1 aRiasi, A.1 aMahdavi, A.H.1 aShirazi, A.0 tCryobiology.g2014 Dec., v. 69, no. 3 p.482-487dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl45487x0011-22407nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cryobiol.2014.10.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03558naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245017700169300001400346520206200360592002802422650001602450650001202466650001702478650001302495650002102508650004302529650001102572650002802583650001702611650001102628650003702639650001902676650001302695650001302708653004102721653004402762653005102806653005102857700001802908773009102926856008603017852000903103655001203112IND60628959220221119050438.0201125e20180901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062895922DNAL7 a10.1016/j.talanta.2018.05.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLin, Shuling,10aPreparation and characterization of vinylimidazole-based polymer monolithic stationary phases for reversed-phase and hydrophilic interaction capillary liquid chromatography  ap. 73-82.  aIn this study, we applied 1-vinylimidazole (VIM) as the functional monomer to prepare a series of VIM-based monolithic stationary phases for both reversed-phase and hydrophilic interaction capillary liquid chromatography (LC) using various dimethacrylates (EDMA: ethylene dimethacrylate; HDDMA: 1,6-hexanediol dimethacrylate; DDDMA: 1,10-decanediol dimethacrylate) as cross-linkers. With a simple thermally initiated free-radical cross-linking polymerization process, VIM-based monolithic stationary phases have been successfully prepared. The porosity, permeability, and column efficiency of synthesized VIM-based monolithic stationary phases were characterized. With similar total porosity (85–90%), the VIM-HDDMA monoliths showed the lowest permeability among the three sets of VIM-based stationary phases. Various sets of non-polar (alkyl benzenes and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons) and polar analytes (phenol derivatives and amphenicol antibiotics) were applied as model compounds to further investigate the retention behavior of the VIM-based monolithic stationary phases for reversed-phase capillary LC analysis using selected VIM-based monolithic columns. While a mixture of organic acids was employed to perform HILIC analysis using the selected VIM-based monolithic columns. The separation selectivity and retention behavior of the VIM-based monolithic stationary phases were compared to those obtained using three previously prepared alkyl methacrylate-based monolithic columns. Strong retention and good resolution of polar analytes (such as phenol derivatives, amphenicol antibiotics, and organic acids) were observed using the selected VIM-based monolithic columns. The strong retention and good resolution might be attributed to the additional hydrogen-bonding between the hydrogen-donating analytes and the hydrogen-accepting imidazolium functionality on the VIM-based stationary phase. The applicability for both reversed-phase and HILIC capillary LC analysis has also been demonstrated using the selected VIM-based monolithic columns.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantibiotics 3abenzene 3acrosslinking 3aethylene 3ahydrogen bonding 3ahydrophilic interaction chromatography 3amodels 3aorganic acids and salts 3apermeability 3aphenol 3apolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons 3apolymerization 3apolymers 3aporosity 0aPolymer monolithic stationary phases 0aVinylimidazole-based monolithic columns 0aReversed-phase capillary liquid chromatography 0aHydrophilic interaction chromatography (HILIC)1 aFuh, Ming-Ren0 tTalanta.g2018 Sept. 01, v. 187 p.73-82dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11742x0039-91407nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.talanta.2018.05.0133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03040naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245010400170300001400274520172700288592002802015650001502043650002802058650002102086650001602107650002602123650001002149650000902159653004202168653002002210653001502230653003102245653001402276700002102290700002202311700002202333700001902355700002702374773012302401856008502524852000902609655001202618IND60541176820221119152717.0190318e201403  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054117682DNAL7 a10.1016/j.compag.2014.01.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMurata, Hiroaki10aMillimeter scale sensor array system for measuring the electrical conductivity distribution in soil  ap. 43-50.  aIn precision agriculture, the efficient use of fertilizer in order to minimize consumption is important. The amount of fertilizer supplied needs to match the amount consumed by the plant. However, it is difficult to estimate the amount absorbed by the roots. The absorption of the fertilizer has to be determined by continually measuring its distribution on a millimeter scale, which is the scale of the around root. In this study, we developed an electrical conductivity sensor array system that can be used to continuously measure the distribution of fertilizer with clarity using several millimeter sized electrical conductivity sensors inserted in the soil. The electrical conductivity sensor array system measuring unit is comprised an array of five electrical conductivity sensor chips which size is 5mm×5mm. The distribution in two different model soil mixtures was measured continuously using the ECSAS to confirm its capability for measuring the diffusion of the fertilizer. The progress of fertilizer diffusion was confirmed with the change in ECw decreasing over time. The ECSAS was used to measure the distribution of ECw in model soil with the dissolution of solid fertilizer for six days to examine the validity and characteristics of the ECw measurements and the benefits of the ECSAS. As a result, it was confirmed that ECSAS can be used to measure the change in the distribution of ECw due to the dissolution and subsequent diffusion of solid fertilizer in real time on a scale of less than a centimeter. Thus, we consider that the ECSAS will become a very valuable system for continuously measuring the dissolution and diffusion of fertilizer in small areas of soil such as on the scale of rhizospheres.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3aelectrical conductivity 3afertilizer rates 3afertilizers 3aprecision agriculture 3aroots 3asoil 0aSoil solution electrical conductivity 0aEC sensor array 0aModel soil 0aDistribution of fertilizer 0aDiffusion1 aFutagawa, Masato1 aKumazaki, Tadashi1 aSaigusa, Masahiko1 aIshida, Makoto1 aSawada, K.q(Kazuaki),0 tComputers and electronics in agriculture.g2014 Mar., v. 102 p.43-50dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl38096x0168-16997nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.compag.2014.01.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02823naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024003500135040001800170100002200188245011200210300001800322506007600340520120100416592002801617506003701645650003901682650001901721650000901740650001701749650001201766650001301778650002301791650001301814650002601827650002501853650002301878650001001901650001701911650001401928650002301942650002101965650003701986650002002023650004202043700002402085700002102109773011802130856004802248852000902296655001202305IND50068975220221207070405.0130903e201310  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006897522DNAL7 a235257752pmid7 aPMC37597342pmcid7 a10.1007/s10661-013-3158-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSwarcewicz, Maria10aComparison of linuron degradation in the presence of pesticide mixtures in soil under laboratory conditions  ap. 8109-8114.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aIt is widely recognised that complex interactions occur between chemicals in mixtures. In many agricultural situations, the use of tank mixes and complex spray programs is a common practice. Insecticides, fungicides and a herbicide being applied in potato protection were used in this research. Interactions between linuron and insecticides, such as thiamethoxam or clothianidin, and fungicides, such as mancozeb or chlorothalonil, were examined in soil. The degradation rate of linuron in soil during laboratory incubation in six treatments was studied. Mixtures of linuron with mancozeb in sandy loam and clay loam soils had a significant effect on the persistence of this herbicide. For example, for the same herbicide, t 1/2 values for linuron were from 37 days in sandy loam to 44 days in clay loam. These values changed (64-67 days) when thiamethoxam and mancozeb were in soil. When mancozeb was added only, the half-life values were from 59 to 62 days, respectively. Other mixtures with chlorothalonil, thiamethoxam and clothianidin did not have any effect. In order to compare linuron degradation rates in soils, a single first-order model and expanded statistical analysis were used.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aagricultural outlook and situation 3achlorothalonil 3aclay 3aclothianidin 3alinuron 3amancozeb 3apesticide mixtures 3apotatoes 3asandy clay loam soils 3astatistical analysis 3astatistical models 3atanks 3athiamethoxam 2aHalf-Life 2aLinuronxchemistry 2aModels, Chemical 2aPesticidesxanalysisxchemistry. 2aSoilxchemistry 2aSoil Pollutantsxanalysisxchemistry.1 aGregorczyk, Andrzej1 aSobczak, Justyna0 tEnvironmental monitoring and assessment.g2013 Oct., v. 185, no. 10 p.8109-8114dSpringer-Verlagx0167-63697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-013-3158-7  aDNAL 7aarticle02963naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245012600170300001400296520134400310592002801654650001501682650001801697650002301715650002301738650001301761650002601774650003401800650002101834650001201855650002001867650002201887650001801909650001801927650000701945650001001952650002601962650002001988650001602008650001102024653001402035653001602049653003202065653003002097653001802127653001602145700002102161700002002182700002102202773009102223856008602314852000902400655001202409IND60628959420221119050553.0201125e20180901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062895942DNAL7 a10.1016/j.talanta.2018.05.0152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCinti, Stefano10aPaper-based synthesis of Prussian Blue Nanoparticles for the development of whole blood glucose electrochemical biosensor  ap. 59-64.  aNowadays, environmentally friendly synthesis pathways for preserving the environment and minimizing waste are strongly required. Herein, we propose filter paper as a convenient scaffold for chemical reactions. To demonstrate this novel approach, Prussian Blue Nanoparticles (PBNPs) were synthesized on filter paper by utilizing few μL of its precursors without external inputs, i.e. pH, voltage, reducing agents, and without producing waste as well. The functional paper, named “Paper Blue”, is successfully applied in the sensing field, exploiting the reduction of hydrogen peroxide at low applied potential. The eco-designed “Paper Blue” was combined with wax- and screen-printing to manufacture a reagentless electrochemical point-of-care device for diabetes self-monitoring, by using glucose oxidase as the biological recognition element. Blood glucose was linearly detected for a wide concentration range up to 25 mM (450 mg/dL), demonstrating its suitability for management of diabetes and glucose-related diseases. The Paper Blue-based biosensor demonstrated a correlation coefficient of 0.987 with commercial glucose strips (Bayer Contour XT). The achieved results demonstrated the effectiveness of this approach, which is also extendible to other (bio)systems to be applied in catalysis, remediation, and diagnostics.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiosensors 3ablood glucose 3acatalytic activity 3achemical reactions 3adiabetes 3adiagnostic techniques 3aelectric potential difference 3aelectrochemistry 3aglucose 3aglucose oxidase 3ahydrogen peroxide 3amanufacturing 3ananoparticles 3apH 3apaper 3apoint-of-care systems 3areducing agents 3aremediation 3awastes 0aBiosensor 0aPaper-based 0aPrussian Blue Nanoparticles 0aScreen-printed electrodes 0aPoint-of-care 0aWhole blood1 aCusenza, Roberto1 aMoscone, Danila1 aArduini, Fabiana0 tTalanta.g2018 Sept. 01, v. 187 p.59-64dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11742x0039-91407nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.talanta.2018.05.0153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03462naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100005700146245010500203300001800308520210100326592002802427596010802455650004402563650002302607650001302630650001102643650001102654650000902665650001002674700006002684700005902744700001902803700001802822700002202840773013602862856008102998852000903079655001203088IND60775790620221121181925.0220430e20220414xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077579062DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcb.1c091892doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHan, Kee Sung1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3535-181810aMicrosized Pore Structure Determination in EPDM Rubbers Using High-Pressure ¹²⁹Xe NMR Techniques  ap. 3135-3142.  aMicrosized pore parameters, such as pore size and distance between pores in a series of model EPDM rubbers, were determined in situ under the pressure of 500 psi using ¹²⁹Xe nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) techniques: spin–lattice (T₁) and spin–spin (T₂) relaxation measurements, pulsed-field gradient (PFG) NMR, and two-dimensional exchange spectroscopy (2D EXSY). The T₁/T₂ (≫1) ratio for the xenon confined in the pores is larger than that for nonconfined free xenon. This suggests that almost the entire pore surface interacts with xenon atoms like a closed pore. While these pores still connect each other through very narrow diffusion/exchange channels, it is possible to observe the echo decay in PFG-NMR and cross-peaks in 2D EXSY. The results show that both diffusion (Dₚₒᵣₑ ≈ 2.1 × 10–¹⁰ m²/s) and exchange (exchange rate, τₑₓcₕ = a few tens of milliseconds) of xenon between a pore within the material and outer surface are prolonged. The exchange distances (l), which correspond to the xenon gas penetration depth, were estimated to be 70–100 μm based on the measured diffusion coefficients and exchange rate (1/τₑₓcₕ). NMR diffraction analysis reveals that pore size (a) and pore distance (b) are on the order of magnitude of micrometers and tens of micrometers, while the diffusion coefficients of xenon gas in the diffusion channels (Dₑff) are about 10–⁸ m²/s. Overall, this study suggests that the pores with a few micrometers connected through very narrow flowing channels with the length of several tens of micrometers are developed 70 to 100 μm below the rubber surface. Furthermore, the overall steady-state diffusion of xenon is slower, approximately 2 orders of magnitudes, than the diffusion in the channel between the pores. The pore and exchange distances correlated with the composition of rubbers showed that the properties of EPDM rubber as a high-pressure gas barrier could be improved by reducing the size of cracks and the depth of gas penetration by the addition of both carbon black and silica fillers.  aPublisher supplied data  aDE-AC05-76RL01830cOffice of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energydhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100006134 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aphysical chemistry 3aporosity 3arubber 3asilica 3asoot 3axenon1 aBurton, Sarah D.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3077-63041 aWalter, Eric D.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3644-55141 aShin, Yongsoon1 aKuang, Wenbin1 aSimmons, Kevin L.0 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2022 Apr. 14, v. 126, no. 16 p.3135-3142dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19284x1520-52077nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcb.1c091893Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02948naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100003000147245009700177300001600274520171100290592002802001650002602029650001702055650001102072650002302083650001302106650002002119650001502139650001102154650001402165650001302179650002202192650001502214651001002229700002202239700002802261700002302289700002002312773010402332856008102436852000902517655001202526IND60112724820221122135155.0141111e201212  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011272482DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jnc.2012.07.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPiquer-Rodríguez, María10aFuture land use effects on the connectivity of protected area networks in southeastern Spain  ap. 326-336.  aLand-use change is a major driver of the global biodiversity crisis, mainly via the fragmentation and loss of natural habitat. Although land-use changes will accelerate to meet humankind's growing demand for agricultural products, conservation planning rarely considers future land uses and how they may affect the connectivity of ecological networks. Here, we integrate land-use models with landscape fragmentation and connectivity analyses, to assess the effects of past and future land-use changes on the connectivity of protected area networks for a highly dynamic region in southeast Spain. Our results show a continued geographical polarisation of land use, with agricultural intensification and urban development in the coastal areas, and the abandonment of traditional land use in the mountains (e.g., 1100km² of natural vegetation are projected to be lost in coastal areas whereas 32km² of natural vegetation would recover in interior areas from 1991 to 2015). As a result, coastal protected areas will experience increasing isolation. The connectivity analyses reveal that the two protected area networks in place in the study area, the European “Natura 2000” and the Andalusian “RENPA” networks, include many landscape connectors. However, we identify two areas that currently lack protection but contain several important patches for maintaining the region's habitat connectivity: the northwestern and the southwestern slopes of the Sierra Cabrera and Bédar protected area. Our results highlight the importance of considering future land-use trajectories in conservation planning to maintain connectivity at the regional scale, and to improve the resilience of conservation networks.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural products 3abiodiversity 3acoasts 3aconservation areas 3ahabitats 3aland use change 3alandscapes 3amodels 3amountains 3aplanning 3aurban development 3avegetation 3aSpain1 aKuemmerle, Tobias1 aAlcaraz-Segura, Domingo1 aZurita-Milla, Raul1 aCabello, Javier0 tJournal for nature conservation.g2012 Dec., v. 20, no. 6 p.326-336dElsevier GmbHx1617-13817nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jnc.2012.07.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02989naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245016000168300001600328520157400344592002801918650001401946650001701960650002201977650002001999650001102019650001502030650002002045650002002065650001302085650001502098650002102113650001702134650002302151651002102174653003002195653002002225653002602245653003502271700001802306773012502324856008502449852000902534655001202543IND60541177120221119152600.0190318e201403  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054117712DNAL7 a10.1016/j.compag.2014.01.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDursun, Mahir13aAn efficient improved photovoltaic irrigation system with artificial neural network based modeling of soil moisture distribution – A case study in Turkey  ap. 120-126.  aAlthough recent years have witnessed excellent technological improvements, the initial setup costs of solar energy systems remain very high. It is for this reason that solar systems have not become sufficiently widespread. Optimum selection of panel power increases the applicability of these systems while at the same time decreasing their cost. The choice of which panel power is to be installed in a solar powered irrigation system will vary in direct proportion to the power of the pump supplying the water. In this study a reduction in pump power, and thus a reduction in the energy demand of the pump, is achieved by ensuring that the solar-powered drip irrigation system in an orchard is using water efficiently. To determine which areas needed to be irrigated, the authors used a soil moisture distribution map obtained via the artificial neural networks method. Using the system and software they developed to determine the soil moisture distribution, they were able to obtain an even distribution of water. Thus by preventing unnecessary irrigation, not only was instantaneous water demand reduced, but it was also possible to ensure the protection of freshwater resources. The system developed by the authors was observed to reduce the orchard’s daily water and energy consumption by 38%. Thus, using the method applied, it was possible to reduce the amount of pump power, depending on the instantaneous water demand, the total power of the solar panels, the current values of the electrical motor, the battery and power control units, and all other costs.  aPublisher supplied data 3abatteries 3acase studies 3acomputer software 3aelectric motors 3aenergy 3afreshwater 3amicroirrigation 3aneural networks 3aorchards 3asoil water 3asolar collectors 3asolar energy 3awater distribution 3aTurkey (country) 0aArtificial neural network 0aDrip irrigation 0aSoil moisture control 0aPhotovoltaic irrigation system1 aÖzden, Semih0 tComputers and electronics in agriculture.g2014 Mar., v. 102 p.120-126dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl38096x0168-16997nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.compag.2014.01.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03041naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002700111040001800138100001900156245011600175300002000291520109900311592002801410650001301438650001901451650001801470650001701488650001101505650003701516650002001553650002201573650002801595650004001623650007801663650003001741650002101771650003201792650001101824650004601835650005401881650006101935650002401996650006402020653001602084653001602100653001502116653001902131700001902150700001902169700002102188700001802209700001702227773013502244852000902379856007502388655001202463IND4477909720221122122847.0160905e20131030xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447790972DNAL7 a241313182pmid7 a10.1021/jf40333932doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Huei-Yan10aAntimetastatic Effects of α-Carotene and Possible Mechanisms of Action in Human Hepatocarcinoma SK-Hep-1 Cells  ap. 10368-10376.  aIn vitro evidence suggests that α-carotene (AC) is an antimetastatic agent against cancer cells, but the mechanistic action is unclear. This study investigated the antimetastatic effect and possible mechanism of AC in comparison with β-carotene (BC) using human hepatocarcinoma SK-Hep-1 cells. Results reveal that treatment with AC (0.5–2.5 μM) for 48 h significantly inhibited invasion, migration, and adhesion of SK-Hep-1 cells in a concentration-dependent manner. These effects of AC were stronger than those of BC at the same concentration (2.5 μM). Mechanistically, AC significantly decreased activities of urokinase plasminogen activator and matrix metalloproteinases (MMP)-2 and -9, but increased protein expression of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, tissue inhibitor of MMP (TIMP)-1 and -2, and nm23-H1, an antimetastatic protein. AC also attenuated focal adhesion kinase-mediated phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinase family resulting in decreased protein expression of Rho and Rac 1. Overall, these data suggest that AC has potential as an antimetastatic agent.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadhesion 3aalpha-carotene 3abeta-carotene 3agelatinase A 3ahumans 3amitogen-activated protein kinase 3aphosphorylation 3aprotein synthesis 3au-plasminogen activator 2aAntineoplastic Agentsxpharmacology 2aCarcinoma, Hepatocellularxdrug therapyxgeneticsxmetabolismxpathology. 2aCarotenoidsxpharmacology 2aCell Line, Tumor 2aCell Movementxdrug effects 2aHumans 2aLiver Neoplasmsxdrug therapyxpathology. 2aMatrix Metalloproteinase 2xgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aMitogen-Activated Protein Kinasesxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aNeoplasm Metastasis 2aUrokinase-Type Plasminogen Activatorxgeneticsxmetabolism. 0aα-carotene 0aβ-carotene 0ametastasis 0aSK-Hep-1 cells1 aYueh, Te-Cheng1 aChen, Yi-Chuan1 aHuang, Chien-Hao1 aYang, Zhimin,1 aHu, Miao-Lin0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2013 Oct. 30, v. 61, no. 43 p.10368-10376dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-51187nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fjf40333933Available from publisher's site 7aarticle03163naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245011700163520144500280592002801725650002201753650002201775650004401797650002501841650002801866650001401894650002901908650001301937650000901950650001901959650001301978650000901991650001802000650002202018650004102040650002202081650000902103650003902112650001802151650002202169653001802191653001802209653001902227653001802246653001802264700001802282700002002300700001902320700005702339773012302396856008102519852000902600655001202609IND60644856720221118121446.0190711e201909  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064485672DNAL7 a10.1016/j.lwt.2019.05.0932doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuang, Zhan10aInhibitory effects and membrane damage caused to fish spoilage bacteria by cinnamon bark (Cinnamomum tamala) oil  aThere is increasing concern regarding the negative effects of synthetic preservatives utilized by the food industry and a demand to replace these synthetic preservatives with natural products by consumers. Thus, the goal of this study was to introduce antimicrobial activity and investigate the underlying mechanism of cinnamon bark oil against common fish spoilage bacteria (Pseudomonas jessenii, Aeromonas veronii, and Shewanella putrefaciens). Cinnamon bark oil exhibited strong antimicrobial activity against tested bacteria, where S. putrefaciens was the most sensitive bacteria, followed by A. veronii and P. jessenii. Tested bacteria cells appeared to undergo lysis after cinnamon bark oil treatment. GC-MS analysis revealed that cinnamaldehyde (85.78%) and diethyl malonate (7.30%) were the major components of cinnamon bark oil. Diethyl malonate had no significant influence on tested bacteria, according to OD260nm results. However, cinnamon bark oil and cinnamaldehyde damaged the macromolecules in cell membranes of tested bacteria, according to FT-IR analysis. Additionally, SDS-PAGE results revealed that cinnamon bark oil and cinnamaldehyde damaged specific membrane proteins of tested bacteria. Collectively, these findings confirm that cinnamon bark oil could be an alternative to synthetic additives used in food preservation, especially in regards to the growth inhibition of S. putrefaciens, A. veronii, and P. jessenii.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAeromonas veronii 3aCinnamomum tamala 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aPseudomonas jessenii 3aShewanella putrefaciens 3aadditives 3aantimicrobial properties 3abacteria 3abark 3acell membranes 3acinnamon 3afish 3afood industry 3afood preservation 3agas chromatography-mass spectrometry 3amembrane proteins 3aoils 3apolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis 3apreservatives 3aspoilage bacteria 0aEssential oil 0aCinnamon bark 0aCinnamaldehyde 0aFood spoilage 0aAntimicrobial1 aJia, Shiliang1 aZhang, Longteng1 aLiu, Xiaochang1 aLuo, Yongkang1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1049-68150 tLebensmittel-Wissenschaft + Technologie.g2019 Sept., v. 112 p.108195-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl1644x0023-64387nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lwt.2019.05.0933Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03425naa a2200637 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002100164245012200185300001600307500001500323520135300338592002801691650001301719650001401732650002201746650001701768650002201785650001301807650001701820650001701837650001101854650001301865650001301878650001101891650008001902650001301982650004101995650004802036650003102084650008002115650002602195650001102221650002702232650002802259650008202287650002702369651000902396651000902405653003802414700002002452700001802472700001802490700003102508700002402539700002202563700003502585773009802620856004802718852000902766655001202775IND4469590920221120122753.0121003e201109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446959092DNAL7 a213654532pmid7 a10.1007/s00436-011-2288-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLasjerdi, Zohreh10aPotentially pathogenic free-living amoebae isolated from hospital wards with immunodeficient patients in Tehran, Iran  ap. 575-580.  a2019-12-06  aThis study investigated the occurrence of free-living amoebae (FLA) in immunodeficiency wards of hospitals in Tehran, Iran. A total of 70 dust and biofilm samples from wards serving transplant, pediatric (malignancies), HIV, leukemia and oncology patients of five university hospitals were collected and examined for the presence of FLA using culturing and molecular approaches. Based on the morphology of the amoebae in plate cultures, primer sets were applied for molecular identification of Acanthamoeba, vahlkampfiid amoebae and Hartmannella. Out of 70 samples, 37 (52.9%) were positive for FLA. Acanthamoeba belonged to the T4 genotype was the most prevalent isolate. Presence of the T4 genotype on medical instruments, including an oxygen mask in an isolation room of an immunodeficiency pediatric ward, should be of concern for health authorities. Acanthamoeba T5 genotypes, Hartmannella vermiformis, and Vahlkampfia avara were also present. These results highlight a clear need for greater attention to improved disinfection, especially where susceptible patients, such as those who are immune-suppressed, are served. To our knowledge, this is the first report of these FLA in immunodeficiency wards in Iran, and also the first to identify Acanthamoeba T5, Hartmannella, and Vahlkampfia in moist habitats, such as biofilms, in this country.  aPublisher supplied data 3aleukemia 3ahospitals 3aimmunosuppression 3auniversities 3amedical equipment 3agenotype 3adisinfection 3aAcanthamoeba 3aoxygen 3apatients 3ahabitats 3aAmoeba 2aAcanthamoebaxclassificationxcytologyxgeneticsxisolation & purification. 2aBiofilms 2aDNA, Protozoanxchemistryxgenetics. 2aDNA, Ribosomal Spacerxchemistryxgenetics. 2aEnvironmental Microbiology 2aHartmannellaxclassificationxcytologyxgeneticsxisolation & purification. 2aHospitals, University 2aHumans 2aImmunocompromised Host 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aSchizopyrenidaxclassificationxcytologyxgeneticsxisolation & purification. 2aSequence Analysis, DNA 3aIran 0aIran 0aimmunosuppression (physiological)1 aNiyyati, Maryam1 aHaghighi, Ali1 aShahabi, Saed1 aBiderouni, Farid Tahvildar1 aTaghipour, Niloofar1 aEftekhar, Mohamad1 aNazemalhosseini Mojarad, Ehsan0 tParasitology research.g2011 Sept., v. 109, no. 3 p.575-580dSpringer-Verlagx0932-01137nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00436-011-2288-5  aDNAL 7aarticle02234naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002200146245008100168300001600249500001400265520110200279592002801381650002601409650001201435650001801447650002601465650001501491650001401506650001801520653002501538653002801563653001801591700001901609700002301628700002901651773007901680856008001759852000901839655001201848IND60711057720221120082302.0200916s2004    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071105772DNAL7 a10.1163/15685410428435132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJourand, Philippe10aNematostatic activity of aqueous extracts of West African Crotalaria species  ap. 765-771.  aNAL-light  aThe in vitro paralysis of second-stage juveniles of Meloidogyne incognita, M. javanica and M. mayaguensis by aqueous extracts of 15 West African Crotalaria species was analysed. A multivariate analysis distinguished four groups, based on their nematostatic activity: i) C. glaucoides extracts were not active; ii) the root extracts from C. goreensis, C. lathyroides and C. perrottetii were more active than the shoot extracts; iii) the shoot extracts from C. comosa and C. cylindrocarpa were more active than the root extracts; iv) both shoot and root extracts of C. atrorubens, C. barkae, C. grantiana, C. hyssopifolia, C. pallida, C. podocarpa, C. retusa, C. senegalensis and C. sphaerocarpa have nematostatic effects depending on either the Crotalaria species or plant tissue from which the extracts were derived. However, considering the greater biomass contribution of the leaves and stems compared to the roots when the plants are used as green manure, C. barkae, C. grantiana, C. pallida and C. podocarpa are the most efficient Crotalaria species, whatever the Meloidogyne species targeted.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMeloidogyne incognita 3abiomass 3agreen manures 3amultivariate analysis 3anematology 3aparalysis 3aplant tissues 0aMELOIDOGYNE JAVANICA 0aMELOIDOGYNE MAYAGUENSIS 0aPLANT EXTRACT1 aRapior, Sylvie1 aFargette, Mireille1 aMateille, T.q(Thierry),0 tNematology.g, v. 6, no. 5 p.765-771dBrillwJournal:2154x1388-55457nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1163/15685410428435133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02474naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002100146245009200167300001800259520101700277592002801294650002301322650003401345650002201379650001601401650002101417650001501438650001401453650001201467650002201479650002301501700006001524700002101584700002301605700002401628700002201652700002201674700005901696700006101755773013501816856008001951852000902031655001202040IND60606075320180918000000.0180724e20180222xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060607532DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcc.7b112492doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLoaiza, Laura C.10aElectrochemical Lithiation of Ge: New Insights by Operando Spectroscopy and Diffraction  ap. 3709-3718.  aThe relatively high cost of metallic germanium (Ge) as a lithium-ion battery negative electrode material is more than counterbalanced by its high capacity, high lithium diffusivity, and electronic conductivity. Using a unique and highly complementary set of operando characterization techniques, we propose a complete mechanism for the reversible lithiation of Ge. The electrochemical mechanism is found to be determined by the process of discharge/charge: (i) independent of the charge/discharge rate amorphous a-LiGe is proposed as the first intermediate during the lithiation of c-Ge, followed by Li₇Ge₃, and (ii) at low potential Li₁₅Ge₄ is observed, but only for moderate rates and never at low rates, where indeed an “overlithiated” phase is preferred. The complementarity of the data obtained from XAS, Raman spectroscopies, and XRD, all in operando mode, was crucial in order to understand the complex mechanism based on reversible formation of the various crystalline and amorphous phases.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRaman spectroscopy 3aX-ray absorption spectroscopy 3aX-ray diffraction 3adiffusivity 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrodes 3agermanium 3alithium 3alithium batteries 3aphysical chemistry1 aLouvain, Nicolas1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8727-68321 aFraisse, Bernard1 aBoulaoued, Athmane1 aIadecola, Antonella1 aJohansson, Patrik1 aStievano, Lorenzo1 aSeznec, Vincent1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5233-59431 aMonconduit, Laure1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3698-856X0 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2018 Feb. 22, v. 122, no. 7 p.3709-3718dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23573x1932-74557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcc.7b112493Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03544naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001500150245013100165300001400296520203000310592002802340650001702368650002402385650002102409650000902430650002102439650002502460650001502485650001302500650001102513650001302524650002602537650001202563650002502575650001002600651001102610653001902621653002202640653002102662653002502683653002602708653001802734700002402752700002602776700001902802773012302821856008502944852000903029655001203038IND60541177320221119152704.0190318e201403  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054117732DNAL7 a10.1016/j.compag.2014.01.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXiao, Ying10aModeling the spatial distribution of crop sequences at a large regional scale using land-cover survey data: A case from France  ap. 51-63.  aAssessing the environmental impacts of agricultural production systems requires spatially explicit information regarding cropping systems. Projecting changes in agricultural land use that are caused by changes in land management practices for analyzing the performance of land activity-related policies, such as agricultural policies, also requires this type of data for model inputs. Crop sequences, which are vital and widely adopted agricultural practices, are difficult to directly detect at a regional scale. This study presents innovative stochastic data mining that was aimed at describing the spatial distribution of crop sequences at a large regional scale. The data mining is performed by hidden Markov models and an unsupervised clustering analysis that processes sequentially observed (from 1992 to 2003) land-cover survey data on the French mainland named Teruti. The 2549 3-year crop sequences were first identified as major crop sequences across the entire territory, which included 406 (merged) agricultural districts, using hidden Markov models. The 406 (merged) agricultural districts were then grouped into 21 clusters according to the similarity of the probabilities of occurrences of major 3-year crop sequences using hierarchical clustering analysis. Four cropping systems were further identified: vineyard-based cropping systems, maize monoculture and maize/wheat-based cropping systems, temporary pasture and maize-based cropping systems and wheat and barley-based cropping systems. The modeling approach that is presented in this study provides a tool to extract large-scale cropping patterns from increasingly available time series data on land-cover and land-use. With this tool, users can (a) identify the homogeneous zones in terms of fixed-length crop sequences across a large territory, (b) understand the characteristics of cropping systems within a region in terms of typical crop sequences, and (c) identify the major crop sequences of a region according to the probabilities of occurrences.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMarkov chain 3aagricultural policy 3acluster analysis 3acorn 3acropping systems 3aenvironmental impact 3aland cover 3aland use 3amodels 3apastures 3aproduction technology 3asurveys 3atime series analysis 3awheat 3aFrance 0aCrop sequences 0aCropping patterns 0aCropping systems 0aHidden Markov models 0aAgricultural land-use 0aTeruti survey1 aMignolet, Catherine1 aMari, Jean-François,1 aBenoît, Marc,0 tComputers and electronics in agriculture.g2014 Mar., v. 102 p.51-63dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl38096x0168-16997nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.compag.2014.01.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02833naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001700139245012100156300001600277500002000293520146500313592002801778650001401806650002001820650001001840650001601850650001301866650001901879650003001898650001701928650001001945650001301955650001101968650001601979650002301995650001602018650001702034650000902051650001602060650003102076700001102107700001502118700002002133773011602153856007302269852000902342655001202351IND60587350920221121033949.0180102e201707  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058735092DNAL7 a10.1111/nph.145962doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Kunpeng10aSET DOMAIN GROUP701 encodes a H3K4‐methytransferase and regulates multiple key processes of rice plant development  ap. 609-623.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aChromatin‐based epigenetic information plays an important role in developmental gene regulation, in response to environment, and in natural variation of gene expression levels. Histone H3 lysine 4 di/trimethylation (H3K4me2/3) is abundant in euchromatin and is generally associated with transcriptional activation. Strikingly, however, enzymes catalyzing H3K4me2/3 remain poorly characterized in crops so far. Here, we investigated the function of the rice SET DOMAIN GROUP 701 (SDG701) gene by molecular and biochemical characterization of the gene product, and by studying effects of its loss or gain of function on plant growth and development. We demonstrated that SDG701 encodes a methytransferase specifically catalyzing H3K4 methylation. Overexpression and knockdown experiments showed that SDG701 is crucial for proper sporophytic plant development as well as for gametophytic transmission that directly impacts rice grain production. In‐depth analysis of plant flowering time revealed that SDG701 promotes rice flowering under either long‐day or short‐day photoperiods. Consistently, the SDG701 protein was found to bind chromatin to promote H3K4me3 and to enhance expression of the rice Hd3a and RFT1 florigens. Collectively, our results establish SDG701 as a major rice H3K4‐specific methyltransferase and provide important insights into function of H3K4me3 deposition in transcription activation of florigens in promoting plant flowering.  aPublisher supplied data 3achromatin 3acrop production 3acrops 3aepigenetics 3aflorigen 3aflowering date 3again-of-function mutation 3agametophytes 3agenes 3ahistones 3alysine 3amethylation 3amethyltransferases 3aphotoperiod 3aplant growth 3arice 3asporophytes 3atranscriptional activation1 aYu, Yu1 aDong, Aiwu1 aShen, Wen‐Hui0 tnew phytologist.g2017 July, v. 215, no. 2 p.609-623dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl44665x0028-646X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/nph.145963Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03977naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100002100155245011300176520244200289592002802731650001602759650001602775650001802791650003102809650001002840650001002850650001502860650001702875650001102892650001902903650003102922650001502953650001102968650002902979650001803008650002003026653002503046653002003071653002203091653001903113653002103132653001903153700001903172700001903191700002803210700002303238773009903261856009003360852000903450655001203459IND60707409220221120212759.0210708e20210130xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070740922DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aquaculture.2020.7358302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLazado, Carlo C.10aCrowding reshapes the mucosal but not the systemic response repertoires of Atlantic salmon to peracetic acid  aKnowledge of the impact of aquaculture chemotherapeutants on fish physiology is scarce. This is particularly relevant for peracetic acid (PAA), a widely used oxidative disinfectant in aquaculture. The chemical behaviour in water is well studied but knowledge about the physiological consequences for fish is limited. The present study investigated the transcriptomics, morphology, and physiology of Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) responses to PAA and explored how crowding prior to exposure influenced these responses. Post-smolts were subjected to crowding by reducing the water volume thereby increasing the density for 1 h before they were exposed to 4.8 ppm PAA for 30 min. The exposed fish were allowed to recover for 2 weeks (w), with samplings carried out at 4 h and 2 w post-exposure (p.e.). There were four treatment groups in total: no crowding/control; no crowding/PAA; crowding/control; and crowding/PAA. The physiological changes were documented at the mucosal (i.e., skin and gills) and systemic (i.e., plasma) levels. The overall external welfare score was in good status in all experimental groups. The treatments did not dramatically affect the number of mucous cells in both the skin and the gills. Branchial histomorphology was in a fairly good condition, despite the increased occurrence of epithelial lifting in the crowded groups at 2 w p.e. The gill transcriptome was affected by crowding, PAA, and their combinations more than the skin, as manifested by the number of differentially expressed genes (DEG) in the former. In general, individual stimuli and their combinations elicited strong transcriptional responses in the gills at 4 h p.e. and a marked recovery was observed 2 w thereafter. Crowding altered the dynamics of transcriptional response to PAA especially at 4 h p.e. and the two mucosal tissues demonstrated a contrasting profile – a higher number of DEGs in the gills without crowding history, while higher skin DEGs were observed in the group subjected to crowding prior to exposure. Plasma metabolomics identified 639 compounds, and the metabolomic changes were affected mainly by crowding and sampling time, and not by PAA exposure. The results revealed the ability of salmon to mobilise physiological countermeasures to PAA exposure that were differentially influenced by crowding, and that such an effect was remarkably exhibited at the mucosa rather than in the circulating metabolome.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSalmo salar 3aaquaculture 3adisinfectants 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3agills 3ametabolome 3ametabolomics 3amucosa 3aperacetic acid 3aphysicochemical properties 3aphysiology 3asalmon 3atranscription (genetics) 3atranscriptome 3atranscriptomics 0aAmoebic gill disease 0aCrowding stress 0aHydrogen peroxide 0aMucosal health 0aOxidative stress 0aPeracetic acid1 aSveen, Lene R.1 aSoleng, Malene1 aPedersen, Lars-Flemming1 aTimmerhaus, Gerrit0 tAquaculture.g2021 Jan. 30, v. 531 p.735830-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl59663x0044-84867nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquaculture.2020.7358303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02432naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100001900154245012500173300001600298520124400314592002801558650003001586650002701616650000801643650002501651650001101676650001601687650001401703650002601717650001201743650001501755650001201770650001001782651001901792700001701811700001401828700001701842773009901859856005501958852000902013655001202022IND50064400620221122023112.0130328e201304  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006440062DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-3059.2012.02644.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJarošová, J.12aA comparative study of the Barley yellow dwarf virus species PAV and PAS: distribution, accumulation and host resistance  ap. 436-443.  aThis study investigated the distribution and characteristics of the Barley yellow dwarf virus (BYDV) species BYDV‐PAS, which was recently separated from BYDV‐PAV, the most commonly studied BYDV species. Throughout 3 years of experimental monitoring of BYDV incidence, PAS was the most frequently occurring species infecting cereals and grasses in the Czech Republic. Furthermore, Rhopalosiphum maidis and Metopolophium dirhodum were recorded as BYDV‐PAS vectors, even though M. dirhodum does not usually transmit BYDV‐PAV. In field experiments with barley and wheat, where virus accumulation, symptoms and effect on the yield were tested, BYDV‐PAV was more severe than PAS. Infection with the BYDV‐PAV isolate resulted in greater expression of symptoms and also in a greater reduction in plant height and grain weight per spike than BYDV‐PAS. In a sensitive cultivar of barley (Graciosa), the amount of viral RNA of BYDV‐PAV was also significantly higher than that of BYDV‐PAS. In a tolerant line (Wbon‐123), however, no such differences were found. In conclusion, although BYDV‐PAS seems to be dominant in the Czech Republic, BYDV‐PAV has the potential to cause more significant crop losses in barley and wheat.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBarley yellow dwarf virus 3aMetopolophium dirhodum 3aRNA 3aRhopalosiphum maidis 3abarley 3acrop losses 3acultivars 3afield experimentation 3agrasses 3amonitoring 3aviruses 3awheat 3aCzech Republic1 aChrpová, J.1 aŠíp, V.1 aKundu, J.

Static dissolution tests are a common setup for such studies, but the obtained results and related errors are impacted by the frequency and protocol of samplings performed to determine release via solution analysis, e.g., ICP-OES. A noninvasive method was developed to continuously monitor glass alteration based on in situ Raman spectrometry of the solution contained in the alteration vessel. The alteration of a benchmark glass, the environment assessment (EA) glass, for 7 days at 90 °C showed that the pH and boron concentration results obtained from solution monitoring and ICP-OES quantification were similar to the pH and boron results obtained from chemometric modeling of the Raman spectra and within error of previously published results in similar conditions. The errors on altered amounts of glass based on B release were similar for both in situ Raman and ICP-OES. The new Raman method provides a more detailed picture of real time monitoring of an alteration experiment, with intervals between monitoring times as short as dozens of seconds. The in situ Raman method also helps to reduce perturbation to experiments caused by the physical sampling of aliquots (including temperature excursions, re-equilibration with atmosphere, volume variation, and potential chemical contamination) by limiting their number and frequency.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRaman spectroscopy 3aboron 3achemometrics 3aenvironmental assessment 3aglass 3amodels 3amonitoring 3apH 3aprotocols 3atemperature1 aRyan, Joseph V.1 aLines, Amanda M.1 aBryan, Samuel A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8826-08801 aNeeway, James J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7046-84081 aChatterjee, Sayandev1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2218-56351 aLukins, Craig D.1 aCasella, Amanda J.0 tAnalytical chemistry.g2018 Sept. 10, v. 90, no. 20 p.11812-11819dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:jnl70375x1520-68827nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.analchem.8b009603Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03522naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245011500166300001600281520186800297592002802165650001502193650003002208650002702238650001402265650002102279650002402300650001202324650002802336650002002364650001102384650000702395650000902402650001602411650001102427650002302438650001102461650001802472650001602490650001502506650001402521650001302535650001902548650001502567650001102582651001502593653003002608653001802638653001602656700002102672700002502693773013502718856008202853852000902935655001202944IND60743031320221121013931.0210806e202106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074303132DNAL7 a10.1016/j.wse.2021.06.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRahman, Arafat10aAssessment of physicochemical properties of water and their seasonal variation in an urban river in Bangladesh  ap. 139-148.  aTo assess the magnitude of water quality decline in the Turag River of Bangladesh, this study examined the seasonal variation of physicochemical parameters of water, identified potential pollution sources, and clustered the monitoring months with similar characteristics. Water samples were collected in four distinct seasons to evaluate temperature, pH, dissolved oxygen (DO) concentration, five-day biochemical oxygen demand (BOD₅), chemical oxygen demand (COD), electrical conductivity (EC), chloride ion (Cl⁻) concentration, total alkalinity (TA), turbidity, total dissolved solids (TDS) concentration, total suspended solids (TSS) concentration, and total hardness (TH) using standard methods. The analytical results revealed that 40% of water quality indices were within the permissible limits suggested by different agencies, with the exception of EC, Cl⁻ concentration, TA, turbidity, DO concentration, BOD₅, and COD in all seasons. Statistical analyses indicated that 52% of the contrasts were significantly different at a 95% confidence interval. The factor analysis presented the best fit among the parameters, with four factors explaining 94.29% of the total variance. TDS, BOD₅, COD, EC, turbidity, DO, and Cl⁻ were mainly responsible for pollution loading and were caused by the significant amount of industrial discharge and toxicological compounds. The cluster analysis showed the seasonal change in surface water quality, which is usually an indicator of pollution from rainfall or other sources. However, the values of different physicochemical properties varied with seasons, and the highest values of pollutants were recorded in the winter. With the change in seasonal temperature and increase in rainfall, the seasonal Turag River water followed a self-refining trend as follows: rainy season > pre-winter > summer > winter.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalkalinity 3abiochemical oxygen demand 3achemical oxygen demand 3achlorides 3acluster analysis 3aconfidence interval 3adecline 3aelectrical conductivity 3afactor analysis 3aoxygen 3apH 3arain 3ariver water 3arivers 3aseasonal variation 3asummer 3asurface water 3atemperature 3atoxicology 3aturbidity 3avariance 3awater hardness 3awet season 3awinter 3aBangladesh 0aPhysicochemical parameter 0aWater quality 0aTurag River1 aJahanara, Ishrat1 aJolly, Yeasmin Nahar0 tWater Science and Engineering.g2021 June, v. 14, no. 2 p.139-148dElsevier B.V.aHohai UniversitywJournal:23243x1674-23707nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wse.2021.06.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02263naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002000139245014600159300001600305500001100321520094200332592002801274650001701302650002501319650002001344650001001364650001501374650001701389650001401406650001201420650001401432650001401446650001701460650001901477650001601496650001001512650002001522650001601542650000901558700001401567700002601581773011601607856007301723852000901796655001201805IND60587351020221121034059.0180102e201707  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058735102DNAL7 a10.1111/nph.143872doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBoyce, C.

III. IV. V. Acknowledgements References SUMMARY: Flowering plants can be far more productive than other living land plants. Evidence is reviewed that productivity would have been uniformly lower and less CO₂‐responsive before angiosperm evolution, particularly during the early evolution of vascular plants and forests in the Devonian and Carboniferous. This introduces important challenges because paleoecological interpretations have been rooted in understanding of modern angiosperm‐dominated ecosystems. One key example is tree evolution: although often thought to reflect competition for light, light limitation is unlikely for plants with such low photosynthetic potential. Instead, during this early evolution, the capacities of trees for enhanced propagule dispersal, greater leaf area, and deep‐rooting access to nutrients and the water table are all deemed more fundamental potential drivers than light.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAngiospermae 3aCarboniferous period 3aDevonian period 3acolor 3aecosystems 3aembryophytes 3aevolution 3aforests 3aleaf area 3anutrients 3apaleoecology 3aphotosynthesis 3atree growth 3atrees 3avascular plants 3awater table 3awind1 aFan, Ying1 aZwieniecki, Maciej A.0 tnew phytologist.g2017 July, v. 215, no. 2 p.552-557dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl44665x0028-646X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/nph.143873Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03313naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245010100170300002000271520178600291592002802077650001302105650003502118650001302153650002002166650001302186650001002199650000902209650001902218650001302237650001802250650001502268650001102283650001902294700002102313700006002334700002102394700002102415700002102436700001802457700002302475700001902498700002602517700002102543700001802564773013102582856008502713852000902798655001202807IND60616637420190201000000.0181020e20180821xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061663742DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.analchem.8b011972doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHolá, Markéta10aFeasibility of Nanoparticle-Enhanced Laser Ablation Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry  ap. 11820-11826.  aNanoparticles (NPs) applied to the surface of some solids can increase signals in inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICPMS). Drops containing 20 and/or 40 nm nanoparticles of Ag and/or Au were deposited on metallic and ceramic/glass samples, and after being dried, both the samples treated with NPs and plain targets were ablated by one pulse per spot. The laser ablation ICPMS (LA-ICPMS) signals were enhanced for metallic samples modified with NPs in comparison to signals produced at the plain, untreated surface. Maps of LA-ICPMS signals recorded for several laser fluences show that the NP-induced signal enhancement exceeds even 2 orders of magnitude for metallic samples. No enhancement was achieved for nonconductive samples. This enhancement is limited to the peripheral annular region of the dried droplet area where NPs are concentrated due to the “coffee stain” effect. Ablation crater profilometric inspection revealed a more uniform material rearrangement over the NP-treated surface compared with the ablated plain target. However, besides a smoother crater bottom, no other evidence of an NP-enhancing effect was noticed, although an increased ablation rate was anticipated. Limits of detection dropped by 1 order of magnitude for the minor elements in the presence of NPs. Observed phenomena depend only on the NP surface concentration but not on the material or size of the NPs. An electron microprobe study of the collected ablation aerosol has shown that aerosol particles consisting of target material are aggregated around the NPs. The hypothesis is that such aggregates exhibit better transport/vaporization efficiency, thus enhancing signals for metallic samples. A detailed study of the suggested mechanism will be continued in ongoing work.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaerosols 3aatomic absorption spectrometry 3aceramics 3adetection limit 3adroplets 3aglass 3agold 3aminor elements 3ananogold 3ananoparticles 3ananosilver 3asilver 3avolatilization1 aSalajková, Zita1 aHrdlička, Aleš1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5732-11341 aPořízka, Pavel1 aNovotný, Karel,1 aČelko, Ladislav1 aŠperka, Petr1 aProcházka, David,1 aNovotný, Jan,1 aModlitbová, Pavlína1 aKanický, Viktor1 aKaiser, Jozef0 tAnalytical chemistry.g2018 Aug. 21, v. 90, no. 20 p.11820-11826dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:jnl70375x1520-68827nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.analchem.8b011973Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03233naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100005400146245016600200300001800366520120800384592002801592596011001620596010401730596011201834650001801946650001401964650000901978650001601987650001602003650001302019650001902032650001702051650002302068650001102091650001002102650001502112650001502127650001702142653003302159653001402192653001502206653001002221700001502231700001602246700001702262700001402279700001902293700001702312700001502329700001802344700005602362773014702418856008102565852000902646655001202655IND60778886820221121044411.0220601e20220518xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077888682DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jafc.2c027292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNi, Yinhua1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7738-597110aSpermidine Ameliorates Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis through Thyroid Hormone-Responsive Protein Signaling and the Gut Microbiota-Mediated Metabolism of Bile Acids  ap. 6478-6492.  aSpermidine, a natural polyamine and physiological autophagy inducer, is involved in various physiological processes. However, the impact and mechanism of spermidine on nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) remains unclarified. We found that daily spermidine intake was significantly lower in volunteers with liver dysfunction than the healthy controls, and the serum and fecal spermidine levels were negatively correlated with the NASH phenotypes. Spermidine supplementation significantly attenuated hepatic lipid accumulation, insulin resistance, hepatic inflammation, and fibrosis in NASH mice induced by a western diet. The ameliorating effect of spermidine on lipid accumulation might be partly regulated by thyroid hormone-responsive protein (THRSP) signaling and autophagy. Moreover, spermidine altered the profile of hepatic bile acids (BAs) and microbial composition and function. Furthermore, spermidine reversed the progression of hepatic steatosis, inflammation, and fibrosis in mice with preexisting NASH. Therefore, spermidine ameliorates NASH partly through the THRSP signaling and the gut microbiota-mediated metabolism of BAs, suggesting that spermidine might be a viable therapy for NASH.  aPublisher supplied data  aIRT_17R97cMinistry of Education of the People's Republic of Chinadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100002338  aLY19C110001cNatural Science Foundation of Zhejiang Provincedhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100004731  a2020R403027cScientific Innovation Program for University Students in Zhejiang Provincedhttps://doi.org/NA 3aWestern diets 3aautophagy 3abile 3ablood serum 3afatty liver 3afibrosis 3afood chemistry 3ainflammation 3ainsulin resistance 3alipids 3aliver 3ametabolism 3aspermidine 3atherapeutics 0anonalcoholic steatohepatitis 0abile acid 0amicrobiota 0aTHRSP1 aHu, Yating1 aLou, Xiaoyi1 aRong, Nianke1 aLiu, Fang1 aYang, Congrong1 aZheng, Aqian1 aYang, Song1 aBao, Jianfeng1 aFu, Zhengwei1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3351-30750 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2022 May 18, v. 70, no. 21 p.6478-6492dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:12177x1520-51187nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jafc.2c027293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02783naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100002900155245014300184520124700327592002801574650002701602650003001629650001101659650001701670650000901687650001801696650002101714650003301735650001401768650001501782650001601797651002101813651001001834653001901844653003001863653001601893653001501909653003101924700001801955700002901973700002002002700002402022700001902046700002602065773009902091856009002190852000902280655001202289IND60707409320221120212901.0210708e20210130xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070740932DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aquaculture.2020.7358242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTandel, Ritesh Shantilal10aMorphological and molecular characterization of Saprolegnia spp. from Himalayan snow trout, Schizothorax richardsonii: A case study report  aSnow trout, Schizothorax richardsonii, in early as well as in advance life stages are highly susceptible to Saprolegnia spp. infections. In the present study, we aimed to identify the Saprolegnia spp. from different life stages of infected snow trout eggs, juveniles, and adults from two geographic regions, Bhimtal and Champawat of Central Himalaya, India. Morphological identification was carried out by microscopic observation of life stages of Saprolegnia. For the molecular characterization, the internal transcribed spacer region (ITS) was amplified using universal primers ITS 1 and ITS 4. On the basis of the morphological and molecular findings, we have identified two Saprolegnia species from snow trout, i.e., Saprolegnia parasitica from eggs and adults; and S. australis from eggs and juveniles. In particular, S. parasitica was isolated from both geographical regions and S. australis only from Bhimtal, where a comparatively higher temperature regime prevails. An in-vitro experiment was conducted to study the growth of Saprolegnia spp. in varying incubation temperatures. The results confirmed that S. australis could not thrive at or below 7 °C, whereas S. parasitica could grow within the temperature range of 4–20 °C.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSaprolegnia parasitica 3aSchizothorax richardsonii 3aadults 3acase studies 3aeggs 3afish diseases 3ain vitro studies 3ainternal transcribed spacers 3ajuveniles 3amicroscopy 3atemperature 3aHimalayan region 3aIndia 0aSaprolegniasis 0aSchizothorax richardsonii 0aTemperature 0aMorphology 0aMolecular characterization1 aDash, Pragyan1 aBhat, Raja Aadil Hussain1 aSharma, Prakash1 aKalingapuram, Kavya1 aDubey, Maneesh1 aSarma, D.q(Debajit),0 tAquaculture.g2021 Jan. 30, v. 531 p.735824-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl59663x0044-84867nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquaculture.2020.7358243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02498naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245014900163300001400312520125800326592002801584650001301612650001101625650001301636650001201649650001701661651002101678651001801699651001001717651001601727653005001743653001401793653001101807653003601818700001701854700001701871773012101888856008202009852000902091655001202100IND60724273120221122230408.0210619e202107  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072427312DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jes.2020.12.0282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLee, Handol10aApplication of an aerosol electrical mobility spectrum analyzer: Charged-particle polarity ratio measurement in the Antarctic and Arctic regions  ap. 81-89.  aAn aerosol electrical mobility spectrum analyzer (AEMSA), developed at Hanyang University, was employed to investigate the particle charge characteristics in the Antarctic and Arctic regions. The particle charge characteristics in these areas were compared with the charging state in Ansan, South Korea, located in the midlatitude, where artificial factors, such as human activity, urbanization, and traffic, might result in a higher total concentration. Furthermore, in Ansan, South Korea, the charged-particle polarity ratio was very stable and was close to 1. However, notably different particle charge characteristics were obtained in the Antarctic and Arctic regions. The imbalance between the numbers of positively and negatively charged particles was evident, resulting in more positive charges on the atmospheric particles. On average, the positively charged particle concentrations in the Antarctic and Arctic areas were 1.4 and 2.8 times higher, respectively, compared with the negatively charged particles. The developed AEMSA system and the findings of this study provide useful information on the characteristics of atmospheric aerosols in the Antarctic and Arctic regions and can be further utilized to study particle formation mechanisms.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaerosols 3ahumans 3alatitude 3atraffic 3aurbanization 3aAntarctic region 3aArctic region 3aChina 3aSouth Korea 0aAerosol electrical mobility spectrum analyzer 0aAntarctic 0aArctic 0aCharged-particle polarity ratio1 aChung, Hyeok1 aAhn, Kang-Ho0 tJournal of environmental sciences (China).g2021 July, v. 105 p.81-89dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12417x1001-07427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jes.2020.12.0283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03020naa a2200649 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002700151245014600178300001400324520120600338592002801544650001901572650002101591650002501612650001301637650002101650650001701671650002101688650001601709650002301725650001501748650001601763650001701779653000901796653000801805653001301813653001001826653001001836653001001846653001501856653001401871653001401885653001401899653000901913653001301922653001001935653001001945653001001955653000801965653001601973653002401989653001902013653001102032653001502043700003002058700002802088700002702116773010802143856008602251961001202337852000902349655001202358IND60543228620221120074857.0190410e201407  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054322862DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodres.2014.05.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRibeiro, Vânia Santos10aChemical characterization and antioxidant properties of a new coffee blend with cocoa, coffee silverskin and green coffee minimally processed  ap. 39-47.  aThe search for new technologies and ingredients with interesting characteristics and potential for incorporation into functional foods emerges in parallel with the demand for alternative sustainable and economically viable blends. Pursuing these aims, the formulation of a new coffee blend with 94% roasted coffee powder (Coffea canephora cv. Robusta and Coffea arabica, 70/30, w/w), 3% cocoa powder, 2% coffee silverskin and 1% golden coffee (green coffee minimally processed) was developed. The influence of the ingredients in the blend was compared with two other commercial coffee blends (in capsule and in a sealed package with a one-way degassing valve), being characterized the formulation, the physicochemical parameters, as its innovation. It is concluded that the developed coffee blend shows an enriched content of bioactive compounds (chlorogenic acids, trigonelline, theobromine and caffeine), displays an important antioxidant capacity and was favorably appreciated due to its sensory characteristics. Moreover, the addition of skin by-product becomes an additional valorization and the processing of green coffee and cocoa was minimized by adding innovation and an optimized extraction.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCoffea arabica 3aCoffea canephora 3aantioxidant activity 3acaffeine 3achlorogenic acid 3acocoa powder 3afunctional foods 3aingredients 3asensory properties 3atechnology 3atheobromine 3atrigonelline 0aABTS 0aCGA 0aCQAtotal 0a3-CQA 0a4-CQA 0a5-CQA 0adiCQAtotal 0a3,4-diCQA 0a3,5-diCQA 0a4,5-diCQA 0aDPPH 0aFQAtotal 0a3-FQA 0a4-FQA 0a5-FQA 0aGAE 0aAntioxidant 0aBioactive compounds 0aCocoa espresso 0aCoffee 0aInnovation1 aLeitão, António Eduardo1 aRamalho, José Cochicho1 aLidon, Fernando Cebola0 tFood research international.g2014 July, v. 61 p.39-47dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl48420x0963-99697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodres.2014.05.0033Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/DA  aDNAL 7aarticle03494naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245018100165300001400346520159700360592002801957650002501985650003202010650001202042650001202054650002102066650001502087650000902102650001302111650001302124650002002137650001702157650002002174650001402194650002402208650001302232650001502245650001102260650002202271650002802293650001802321653002502339653001802364653003102382653001902413653003002432700002102462700006002483700006002543700002302603700006002626773013802686856008302824852000902907655001202916IND60782020320221120180813.0220802e20220917xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078202032DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbrc.2022.06.0972doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMonden, Kota10aRoot-specific activation of plasma membrane H+-ATPase 1 enhances plant growth and shoot accumulation of nutrient elements under nutrient-poor conditions in Arabidopsis thaliana  ap. 39-45.  aPlasma membrane (PM) H⁺-ATPase contributes to nutrient uptake and stomatal opening by creating proton gradient across the membrane. Previous studies report that a dominant mutation in the OPEN STOMATA2 locus (OST2-2D) constitutively activates Arabidopsis PM H⁺-ATPase 1 (AHA1), which enlarges proton motive force for root nutrient uptake. However, the stomatal opening is also constitutively enhanced in the ost2-2D, causing drought hypersensitivity. To develop plants with improved nutrient acquisition and normal stomatal movement, we generated grafted plants (scion/rootstock: Col-0 (WT)/ost2-2D), and compared their growth, nutrient element content, and transcriptomes with those of control plants (WT/WT) under nutrient-rich or nutrient-poor conditions. WT/ost2-2D shoots had larger weights, rosette diameter, leaf blade area, and content of C, N, K, Ca, S, P, Mg, Na, Mn, B, Co, and Mo under nutrient-poor conditions compared with WT/WT shoots. The root weights and primary root length were greater in WT/ost2-2D plants than in WT/WT plants under both nutrient conditions. Root expression of the high-affinity nitrate transporter NRT2.1, potassium transporter HAK5, and divalent cation transporter IRT1 was higher in WT/ost2-2D plants than in WT/WT plants under nutrient-poor conditions. These results suggest that root-specific activation of PM H⁺-ATPase enhances plant growth by increasing root uptake of nutrient elements under nutrient-poor conditions. Our study presents a novel approach to improving nutrient uptake efficiency in crops for low-input sustainable agriculture.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3aH-transporting ATP synthase 3acations 3adrought 3ahypersensitivity 3aleaf blade 3aloci 3amutation 3anitrates 3anutrient uptake 3aplant growth 3aplasma membrane 3apotassium 3aproton-motive force 3aresearch 3arootstocks 3ascions 3astomatal movement 3asustainable agriculture 3atranscriptome 0aArabidopsis thaliana 0aMicrografting 0aNutrient uptake efficiency 0aOPEN STOMATA 2 0aPlasma membrane H+-ATPase1 aKamiya, Takehiro1 aSugiura, Daisuke1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3003-91711 aSuzuki, Takamasa1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1977-05101 aNakagawa, Tsuyoshi1 aHachiya, Takushi1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3719-76200 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2022 Sept. 17, v. 621 p.39-45dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl46848x0006-291X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2022.06.0973Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01523naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001600140245006200156300001800218520039200236592002800628650002100656650002300677650001600700650001700716650003100733650000900764650002300773650001600796700001700812700001900829700001800848700001800866700001400884700002200898773013400920856007401054852000901128655001201137IND60617451920221118064749.0181025e20180412xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061745192DNAL7 a10.1039/c7cc09898g2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBo, Shaowei10aIn vivo drug tracking with ¹⁹F MRI at therapeutic dose  ap. 3875-3878.  aTracking drugs with ¹⁹F MRI would be beneficial for developing theranostics and optimizing drug therapy.

Power loss analysis is efficient for the monitoring of large power plants and for developing an optimal cleaning schedule, but it is not adapted for remote monitoring of standalone photovoltaic systems that are used in rural and poor regions. Indeed, this technique relies on a costly and dirt sensitive irradiance sensor. This paper investigates the possibility of a low-cost monitoring of cleaning interventions on photovoltaic modules during daytime. We believe that it can be helpful to know whether the soiling is regularly removed or not, and to decide if it is necessary to carry out additional cleaning operations. The problem is formulated as a classification task to automatically identify the occurrence of a cleaning intervention using a time window of temperature, voltage and current measurements of a photovoltaic array. We investigate machine learning tools based on Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines, Artificial Neural Networks and Random Forest to achieve such classification task. In addition, we study the influence of the temporal resolution of the signals and the feature extraction on the classification performance. The experiments are conducted on a real dataset and show promising results with classification accuracy of up to 95%. Based on the results, three implementation strategies addressing different practical needs are proposed. The results may be particularly useful for non-governmental organizations, governments and energy service companies to improve the maintenance level of their photovoltaic facilities.  aPublisher supplied data 3abusiness enterprises 3acleaning 3adata collection 3aelectric potential difference 3alight intensity 3amonitoring 3aneural networks 3anongovernmental organizations 3apower plants 3aregression analysis 3asolar collectors 3asolar energy 3asupport vector machines 3atemperature 0aPhotovoltaics 0aSoiling 0aMaintenance 0aMachine learning 0aDetection1 aMeunier, Simon1 aSamé, Allou1 aQuéval, Loïc1 aDarga, Arouna1 aOukhellou, Latifa1 aMulton, Bernard0 tApplied energy.g2020 Apr. 01, v. 263 p.114642-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11876x0306-26197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2020.1146423Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03597naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245008300170520243600253592002802689650001902717650001702736650001402753650001502767650002602782650001202808650001002820650002002830653002202850653001802872653001302890653001702903653002702920700001602947700002802963700001602991773009903007856008403106852000903190655001203199IND60743031720221121002448.0210705e202106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074303172DNAL7 a10.1016/j.animal.2021.1002332doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKoralesky, K.E.10aUsing Realistic Evaluation to understand how interventions work on dairy farms  aInterventions that aim to help farmers change on-farm practices recommend that advisors communicate effectively with farmers, work collaboratively to set goals and provide farmers with resources that are applicable to the farm context. We developed an intervention that aimed to help farmers modify and use a standard operating procedure (SOP) for colostrum management; failure of passive transfer of immunoglobulins is common on dairy farms and SOPs for colostrum management are increasingly required by farm animal welfare assurance programs. We used Realistic Evaluation to evaluate whether, how and why our intervention to help farmers modify and use SOPs for colostrum management facilitated change and provide recommendations based on our approach that can improve the design and implementation of future interventions. We used a multiple case study on five farms over 8 months, collecting data through interviews, participant observation, document analysis and field notes. We identified three mechanisms that influenced whether participants modified and used their SOP. The purpose mechanism distinguished between participants who thought the aim of the SOP was for farm staff to learn and understand how to complete a task versus those who thought that the SOP was only useful for compliance with assurance programs. The utility mechanism distinguished between participants who thought that the SOP would be helpful for daily use on their farm, versus those who did not. The physical text mechanism distinguished between participants who used the templates we provided to modify and use their SOP, versus those who did not. A key contextual factor on all farms was participant belief of having capable and engaged staff on their farm; modification and use of the SOP did not occur unless this was the case. To facilitate change, intervention developers should actively participate in the intervention to develop an understanding of farmer needs, understand the purpose behind different goals set by farmers and integrate tools, advice and resource demonstrations when possible. We conclude that Realistic Evaluation is a useful framework for evaluating how contexts and mechanisms generate outcomes on farms, and to understand how, and in which contexts, complex interventions facilitate change. We suggest that this approach can improve the success of interventions and help direct the approaches used on different farms.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal welfare 3acase studies 3acolostrum 3acompliance 3afarmed animal species 3afarmers 3afarms 3aimmunoglobulins 0aBehavioral change 0aCommunication 0aEmployee 0aGoal setting 0aHerd-health management1 aMills, K.E.1 avon Keyserlingk, M.A.G.1 aWeary, D.M.0 tAnimal.g2021 June, v. 15, no. 6 p.100233-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl3938811x1751-73117nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.animal.2021.1002333Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02377naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001900155245018300174520105800357592002801415650002001443650001001463650001201473650001701485650001601502650001301518653000901531653001701540653001101557653002701568700002101595700002501616700002201641700001701663700001701680700001801697700001701715700001601732773010801748856009001856852000901946655001201955IND60776533920221118220331.0220606e202207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077653392DNAL7 a10.1016/j.smallrumres.2022.1067082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aArslan, Korhan10aRelationship between transport-induced stress and the expression levels of some genes in the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) signaling pathway in Kivircik lambs  aThis study investigated the relationship between expression levels of SCD, LPL PPARα, PPARγ and PCK2 genes in the PPAR signaling pathway and blood stress parameters and meat quality in Kivircik lambs. Two trial groups were formed from 4 to 5-month-old lambs, by 0.2 m²/lamb and 0.3 m²/lamb stocking density during transport. The differences between the groups in terms of neutrophil: leukocyte and glucose in the pre-transport period were significant. The difference between the groups regarding expression levels of SCD gene was significant. A strong positive correlation was found between PCK2 gene expression level and glucose-post-transport, 0.3 m²/lamb. In conclusion, the study presented the existence of a relationship between meat quality characteristics and the expression levels of SCD, PPARɣ, LPL and PCK2 genes in the PPAR signaling pathway, as well as the expression levels of SCD and PCK2 genes and concluded that the stress responses of lambs due to transportation were related to the expression levels of the SCD and PCK2 genes.  aPublisher supplied data 3agene expression 3agenes 3aglucose 3ameat quality 3aneutrophils 3aresearch 0aLamb 0aMeat quality 0aStress 0aPPAR signaling pathway1 aDaldaban, Fadime1 aKecici, Pembe Dilara1 aAksel, Esma Gamze1 aEkiz, Bulent1 aAkyuz, Bilal1 aYilmaz, Alper1 aAkcay, Aytac1 aIscan, Kaan0 tSmall ruminant research.g2022 July, v. 212 p.106708-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl44843x0921-44887nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.smallrumres.2022.1067083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03311naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005800148245008700206300001600293520163300309592002801942650001601970650001601986650001902002650001602021650001802037650001502055650001402070650001702084650001702101650001402118650001702132650001902149650001402168650001002182650002802192650001002220650000902230700005902239700006202298700006402360700001902424700006202443700002802505700006702533773011402600856008202714852000902796655001202805IND60747818520221116231220.0210820e202109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074781852DNAL7 a10.1007/s40502-021-00607-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJain, Devendra1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4345-153610aEffect of microbial consortia on growth and yield of wheat under typic haplustepts  ap. 570-580.  aThe uses of environment friendly biological fertilizers to improve plant growth and crop productivity are of great importance for soil health and sustainable agriculture. Hence, an experiment was conducted in two successive rabi seasons of 2017–18 and 2018–19 to analyze the impact of microbial consortium (combination of local strains of Azotobacter, phosphorus solubilizing bacteria, potassium mobilizing bacteria and zinc solubilizing bacteria) and inorganic fertilizers on growth, yield and economics of wheat. The experiment consisting twelve treatment combinations and different levels of inorganic fertilizers along with biofertilizer consortia replicated three times in randomized block design. The results emanated from present investigation revealed that plant height, plant biomass, root length, chlorophyll content in leaves at different growth stages of wheat crop was influenced by biofertilizer + RDF treatment combinations. The maximum yield attributes viz. effective tillers (85.67 m row length), ear length (16.46 and 11.10 cm with awns and without awns, respectively), test weight (57.12 g), number of spikelet ear⁻¹ (86.67) were obtained under biofertilizer consortia 2 with 100% RDF which was statistically higher over control. This increasing trend in yield attributes resulted higher grain (54.83 q ha⁻¹), straw (79.26 q ha⁻¹), biological yield (134.09 q ha⁻¹) and harvest index (40.92%) in superior treatment combination i.e. biofertilizer consortia 2 with 100% RDF, ultimately obtained the utmost monetary return in terms of net return (Rs 97,893 ha⁻¹) and B–C ratio (2.66).  aPublisher supplied data 3aAzotobacter 3aHaplustepts 3abiofertilizers 3achlorophyll 3aharvest index 3aphosphorus 3aphytomass 3aplant growth 3aplant height 3apotassium 3asoil quality 3asolubilization 3aspikelets 3astraw 3asustainable agriculture 3awheat 3azinc1 aMeena, Ram Hari1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4458-09271 aChoudhary, Jagdish1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4760-19571 aSharma, Shanti Kumar1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2078-395X1 aChauhan, Surya1 aBhojiya, Ali Asger1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2869-43421 aKhandelwal, Sunil Kumar1 aMohanty, Santosh Ranjan1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6065-64450 tPlant Physiology Reports.g2021 Sept., v. 26, no. 3 p.570-580dSpringer IndiawJournal:27098x2662-253X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s40502-021-00607-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02742naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100007000150245013300220300002000353520163800373592002802011650002302039650002502062650002202087650001602109650001302125700002202138700002002160700002202180773013202202856008502334852000902419655001202428IND60616637820190201000000.0190128e20180921xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061663782DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.analchem.8b015512doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGundlach-Graham, Alexander1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4806-625510aMonte Carlo Simulation of Low-Count Signals in Time-of-Flight Mass Spectrometry and Its Application to Single-Particle Detection  ap. 11847-11855.  aMany modern time-of-flight mass spectrometry (TOFMS) instruments use fast analog-to-digital conversion (ADC) with high-speed digitizers to record mass spectra with extended dynamic range (compared to time-to-digital conversion). The extended dynamic range offered by ADC detection is critical for accurate measurement of transient events. However, the use of ADC also increases the variance of the measurements by sampling the gain statistics of electron multipliers (EMs) used for detection. The influence of gain statistics on the shape of TOF signal distributions is especially pronounced at low count rates and is a major contributor to measurement variance. Here, we use Monte Carlo methods to simulate low-ion-count TOFMS signals as a function of Poisson statistics and the measured pulse-height distribution (PHD) of the EM detection system. We find that a compound Poisson distribution calculated via Monte Carlo simulation effectively describes the shape of measured TOFMS signals. Additionally, we apply Monte Carlo simulation results to single-particle inductively coupled plasma (sp-ICP) TOFMS analysis. We demonstrate that subtraction of modeled TOFMS signals can be used to quantitatively uncover particle-signal distributions buried beneath dissolved-signal backgrounds. On the basis of simulated signal distributions, we also calculate new critical values (LC) that are used as decision thresholds for the detection of discrete particles. This new detection criterion better accounts for the shape of dissolved signal distributions and therefore provides more robust identification of single particles with ICP-TOFMS.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMonte Carlo method 3aPoisson distribution 3amass spectrometry 3amultipliers 3avariance1 aHendriks, Lyndsey1 aMehrabi, Kamyar1 aGünther, Detlef,0 tAnalytical chemistry.g2018 Sept. 21, v. 90, no. 20 p.11847-11855dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:jnl70375x1520-68827nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.analchem.8b015513Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01763naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002000139245015400159300001800313520062600331592002800957650001600985650001601001650001301017650002301030650002301053650001101076650003601087650002801123650001301151650001101164650001501175700002201190773010501212856007501317852000901392655001201401IND60578697320221122204019.0170813e20140516xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057869732DNAL7 a10.1021/ol50101642doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPan, Xiangcheng10aNeutral Sulfur Nucleophiles: Synthesis of Thioethers and Thioesters by Substitution Reactions of N-Heterocyclic Carbene Boryl Sulfides and Thioamides  ap. 2728-2731.  aNewly discovered boryl sulfides and N-borylthioamides are shown to serve as neutral sources of sulfur nucleophiles in substitutions reactions. For example, heating of diMe-Imd-BH(SPh)₂ with benzyl bromides, primary bromides, or acid chlorides provides the corresponding thioethers or thioesters in high yields. Likewise, N-phenyltetrazole thioethers/esters are made from a readily available N-borylthionotetrazole. The formation of the boryl sulfide and its onward nucleophilic substitution can be telescoped down to a one-pot reaction whose components are an NHC–borane (NHC-BH₃), a disulfide, and an electrophile.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLewis acids 3aLewis bases 3acarbenes 3achemical reactions 3achemical structure 3aesters 3aheterocyclic nitrogen compounds 3aorganobromine compounds 3asulfides 3asulfur 3athioamides1 aCurran, Dennis P.0 tOrganic letters.g2014 May 16, v. 16, no. 10 p.2728-2731dAmerican Chemical Societyx1523-70527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fol50101643Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03640naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002400149245017300173300001400346520190900360592002802269650001502297650002002312650001402332650002402346650004302370650001702413650002202430650002102452650001402473650002102487650001902508650002602527650001502553650001602568650002302584650001102607650001102618650001102629653002002640653002402660653002402684653002202708653003302730653003102763700002402794700002302818700002402841700002402865773010402889856008402993852000903077655001203086IND60530698720221118173040.0180905e20160720xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053069872DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jprot.2016.05.0272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMcCleary, Ryan J.R.10aProteomic comparisons of venoms of long-term captive and recently wild-caught Eastern brown snakes (Pseudonaja textilis) indicate venom does not change due to captivity  ap. 51-62.  aSnake venom is a highly variable phenotypic character, and its variation and rapid evolution are important because of human health implications. Because much snake antivenom is produced from captive animals, understanding the effects of captivity on venom composition is important. Here, we have evaluated toxin profiles from six long-term (LT) captive and six recently wild-caught (RC) eastern brown snakes, Pseudonaja textilis, utilizing gel electrophoresis, HPLC-MS, and shotgun proteomics. We identified proteins belonging to the three-finger toxins, group C prothrombin activators, Kunitz-type serine protease inhibitors, and phospholipases A2, among others. Although crude venom HPLC analysis showed LT snakes to be higher in some small molecular weight toxins, presence/absence patterns showed no correlation with time in captivity. Shotgun proteomics indicated the presence of similar toxin families among individuals but with variation in protein species. Although no venom sample contained all the phospholipase A2 subunits that form the textilotoxin, all did contain both prothrombin activator subunits. This study indicates that captivity has limited effects on venom composition, that venom variation is high, and that venom composition may be correlated to geographic distribution.Through proteomic comparisons, we show that protein variation within LT and RC groups of snakes (Pseudonaja textilis) is high, thereby resulting in no discernible differences in venom composition between groups. We utilize complementary techniques to characterize the venom proteomes of 12 individual snakes from our study area, and indicate that individuals captured close to one another have more similar venom gel electrophoresis patterns than those captured at more distant locations. These data are important for understanding natural variation in and potential effects of captivity on venom composition.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantivenoms 3acaptive animals 3aevolution 3agel electrophoresis 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3ahuman health 3amass spectrometry 3amolecular weight 3aphenotype 3aphospholipase A2 3aphospholipases 3aproteinase inhibitors 3aproteomics 3aprothrombin 3aserine proteinases 3asnakes 3atoxins 3avenoms 0aVenom variation 0aSnakes in captivity 0aThree-finger toxins 0aPhospholipases A2 0aSnake prothrombin activators 0aVenom geographic variation1 aSridharan, Sindhuja1 aDunstan, Nathan L.1 aMirtschin, Peter J.1 aKini, R.

The study was carried out in a 2.5L direct injection common-rail turbodiesel engine using an ultra low sulfur diesel fuel (BP15). The study has two objectives. The first objective is to investigate the reactivity difference of the soot generated at four engine modes, spanning conditions of most interest in the engine operating map. The results show that the impact of engine speed at constant torque is more pronounced than the impact of engine torque (equivalence ratio) at constant engine speed. The effect of the engine torque at constant engine speed, especially at higher speed, is not observable in this experiment. The second objective is to investigate the reactivity and nanostructure of soot generated at different combustion phasing by advancing and retarding the fuel start of injection (SOI) timing. Reaction kinetics obtained from thermogravimetric analysis show that the rate constant of the sample for retarding SOI timing (retarded 2 CAD) is 2.3 times that for advancing SOI timing (advanced 2 CAD).

Cellular proteins were extracted, resolved by 2-DE, and stained with Deep Purple fluorescence dye (n=5 gels derived from 5 independent samples/group). Spot matching, quantitative intensity analysis, and statistics revealed significant changes in levels of nine protein spots after testosterone treatment. These proteins were then identified by nanoLC-ESI-Qq-TOF MS/MS. Global protein network analysis using STRING software revealed α-enolase as the central node of protein–protein interactions. The increased level of α-enolase was then confirmed by Western blotting analysis, whereas immunofluorescence study revealed the increased α-enolase on cell surface and intracellularly. Functional analysis confirmed the potential role of the increased α-enolase in enhanced calcium oxalate monohydrate (COM) crystal-cell adhesion induced by testosterone. Finally, neutralization of surface α-enolase using anti-α-enolase antibody successfully reduced the enhanced COM crystal–cell adhesion to the basal level. Our data provided in vitro evidence of promoting effect of testosterone on kidney stone disease via enhanced COM crystal–cell adhesion by the increased surface α-enolase.The incidence of kidney stone disease in male is 2- to 4-fold greater than in female. One of the possible factors of the male preference is the higher testosterone hormone level. However, precise molecular mechanisms that testosterone plays in kidney stone disease remained unclear. Our present study is the first exploratory investigation on such aspect using a proteomics approach. Our data also provide a novel mechanistic aspect of how testosterone can impact the risk of kidney stone formation (i.e. the discovery that testosterone increases alpha-enolase expression on the surface of renal tubular cells that is responsible, at least in part, for crystal–cell adhesion).  aPublisher supplied data 3aWestern blotting 3aantibodies 3acalcium oxalate 3acomputer software 3afemales 3afluorescent antibody technique 3afluorescent dyes 3agels 3amales 3aneutralization 3aphosphopyruvate hydratase 3aprotein-protein interactions 3aproteins 3aproteomics 3arenal calculi 3arisk 3atestosterone 0aCalcium oxalate 0aCrystal adhesion 0aEnolase 0aKidney stone 0aNephrolithiasis 0aTestosterone1 aPeerapen, Paleerath1 aKhamchun, Supaporn1 aFong-ngern, Kedsarin1 aChutipongtanate, Somchai1 aThongboonkerd, Visith0 tJournal of proteomics.g2016 July 20, v. 144 p.11-22dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12134x1874-39197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jprot.2016.05.0283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03805naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002200150245014300172300001600315520202400331592002802355650002302383650002202406650002202428650001302450650001102463650001902474650001002493650002402503650001102527650001902538650002302557650003302580650002202613650001802635650001602653650001802669650001302687650001502700650001202715650002202727650001602749653002302765653002202788653004202810653002202852653001302874653001302887700002502900700002202925700002902947700002502976773012003001856008503121852000903206655001203215IND60535307720221121043019.0190401e20141015xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053530772DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vetpar.2014.09.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGarcía-Lunar, P.10aProteomics reveals differences in protein abundance and highly similar antigenic profiles between Besnoitia besnoiti and Besnoitia tarandi  ap. 434-443.  aBesnoitia besnoiti and Besnoitia tarandi are two cyst-forming apicomplexan parasites of the genus Besnoitia. B. besnoiti uses cattle as an intermediate host, in which it causes a disease that progresses in two sequential phases: the acute anasarca stage and the chronic scleroderma stage. Reindeer and caribou act as intermediate hosts for B. tarandi, which causes clinical signs similar to those caused by B. besnoiti. Previous studies demonstrated high molecular similarity, as determined by 18S and ITS-1 RNA sequences, between these Besnoitia spp., and strong serological cross-reactivity between these species has recently been demonstrated. Thus, a difference gel electrophoresis approach and mass spectrometry analysis were used to describe the proteomes and explore differences in protein abundance between B. besnoiti and B. tarandi in tachyzoite extracts. Immunoproteomes were also compared using 2-DE immunoblotting with polyclonal sera from experimentally infected rabbits. From approximately 1400 spots detected in DIGE-gels, 28 and 29 spots were differentially abundant in B. besnoiti and B. tarandi tachyzoites, respectively (±1.5-fold, p<0.05). Four and 13 spots were exclusively detected in B. besnoiti and B. tarandi, respectively. Of the 32 differentially abundant spots analyzed by MALDI-TOF/MS, 6 up-regulated B. besnoiti proteins (LDH; HSP90; purine nucleoside phosphorylase and 3 hypothetical proteins) and 6 up-regulated B. tarandi proteins (G3PDH; LDH; PDI; mRNA decapping protein and 2 hypothetical proteins) were identified. Interestingly, no specific antigen spots were recognized by sera on any of the Besnoitia species studied and a similar antigen profile has been observed for B. tarandi and B. besnoiti sera when cross reactions were studied. This fact corroborates the difficulty in discerning Besnoitia infections using current serological assays. The present study underscores the importance of sequencing the B. besnoiti genome for species diversity studies of the genus Besnoitia.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBesnoitia besnoiti 3aBesnoitia tarandi 3aRangifer tarandus 3aantigens 3acattle 3across reaction 3aedema 3agel electrophoresis 3agenome 3aimmunoblotting 3aintermediate hosts 3ainternal transcribed spacers 3amass spectrometry 3amessenger RNA 3anucleosides 3aphosphorylase 3aproteins 3aproteomics 3arabbits 3aspecies diversity 3atachyzoites 0aBesnoitia besnoiti 0aBesnoitia tarandi 0aDifference gel electrophoresis (DIGE) 0aMass spectrometry 0aImmunome 0aProteome1 aRegidor-Cerrillo, J.1 aOrtega-Mora, L.M.1 aGutiérrez-Expósito, D.1 aÁlvarez-García, G.0 tVeterinary parasitology.g2014 Oct. 15, v. 205, no. 3-4 p.434-443dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl11815x0304-40177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vetpar.2014.09.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04007naa a2200901 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100002800155245011100183500001400294520168500308592002801993650004402021650002202065650001502087650001402102650002202116650001602138650001102154650001802165650001902183650002202202650001602224650001902240650001502259650001402274650001402288650001702302650001902319650001102338650001802349650001302367650002602380650001902406653001202425653003302437653002002470653001002490653001202500653000802512653000902520653000802529653000802537653000802545653000802553653000702561653000802568653000802576653001202584653000902596653000802605653000802613653000802621653000802629653000902637653000902646653000802655653000802663653000702671653000802678653000702686653000802693700002902701700003402730700002202764700002102786700002002807700002302827700002602850700002702876773009102903856009002994852000903084655001203093IND60707410020221120231849.0201111e202101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070741002DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2020.1276712doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDella Rocca, Daniela G.10aPeroxidation and photo-peroxidation of pantoprazole in aqueous solution using silver molybdate as catalyst  aNAL-light  aIn this study, silver molybdate was used as a catalyst in different oxidation processes to degrade pantoprazole (PAN) from aqueous suspension. The catalyst was synthesized using a controlled precipitation method and characterized by XRD, FTIR spectroscopy, BET analysis, Zeta potential, FEG-SEM/EDS, DRS and EPR. The α- and β-phases of Ag₂MoO₄ were identified as crystalline structure of the butterfly-shaped particles. The metastable α-phase could be completely converted into β-Ag₂MoO₄ by thermal treatment at 300 °C. The band gap energy of β-Ag₂MoO₄ (Eg = 3.25 eV) is slightly higher than for as-prepared catalyst (α-Ag₂MoO₄ + β-Ag₂MoO₄) (Eg = 3.09 eV), suggesting that as-prepared catalyst should be active under visible light. PAN is sensible to UV light irradiation, and the addition of H₂O₂ as electron acceptor enhanced the mineralization rate. In the catalytic UV-based reactions, high PAN oxidation efficiencies were obtained (>85%) but with low mineralization (32-64%). Catalytic peroxidation and photo-catalytic peroxidation under visible light showed the highest PAN oxidation efficiency, leading to its almost complete mineralization (>95%), even under dark conditions (98% in 120 min). Several degradation byproducts were identified and three mechanistic routes of PAN decomposition were proposed. The identified byproducts are less toxic than the parent compound. EPR coupled with the spin trapping method identified •OH radicals as the main ROS species in both photocatalytic and catalytic peroxidation reactions. Ag₂MoO₄ showed to be a promising catalyst to promote the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide into ROS.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aaqueous solutions 3abyproducts 3acatalysts 3acrystal structure 3adegradation 3aenergy 3afree radicals 3aheat treatment 3ahydrogen peroxide 3airradiation 3amineralization 3amolybdates 3aoxidation 3aparticles 3aperoxidation 3aphotocatalysis 3asilver 3aspin trapping 3atoxicity 3aultraviolet radiation 3azeta potential 0aAg2MoO4 0aAdvanced oxidation processes 0aPharmaceuticals 0a•OH 0aAg2MoO4 0aAOP 0aDMPO 0aDRS 0aDTA 0aECB 0aEDS 0aEg 0aEPR 0aEVB 0aFEG-SEM 0aFTIR 0aPAN 0aPBN 0aPVP 0aROS 0aSBET 0aTEMP 0aTGA 0aTOC 0aUV 0aVis 0aVP 0aXRD1 aVictória, Henrique F.V.1 aMoura-Nickel, Camilla Daniela1 aScaratti, Gidiane1 aKrambrock, Klaus1 aDe Noni, Agenor1 aVilar, Vítor J.P.1 aJosé, Humberto Jorge1 aMoreira, Regina F.P.M.0 tChemosphere.g2021 Jan., v. 262 p.127671-dElsevier LtdwJournal:1969x0045-65357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2020.1276713Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02740naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100005100142245011400193300001800307500002000325520116000345592002801505596005901533596005901592596005901651596005901710596005901769596008501828650001201913650001901925650001501944650001301959650001301972650001401985650001601999700001502015700005702030700001402087773013102101856007702232852000902309655001202318IND60789619120221121052952.0220822e201704  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078961912DNAL7 a10.1002/2016JC0124682doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Rui1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8134-155710aResponse of the Kuroshio Extension path state to near‐term global warming in CMIP5 experiments with MIROC4h  ap. 2871-2883.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aIn this study, responses of the Kuroshio Extension (KE) path state to near‐term (2006–2035) global warming are investigated using a Kuroshio‐resolving atmosphere‐ocean coupled model. Under the representative concentration pathway 4.5 (RCP4.5) forcing, the KE system is intensified and its path state tends to move northward and becomes more stable. It is suggested that the local anticyclonic wind stress anomalies in the KE region favor the spin‐up of the southern recirculation gyre, and the remote effect induced by the anticyclonic wind stress anomalies over the central and eastern midlatitude North Pacific also contributes to the stabilization of the KE system substantially. The dominant role of wind stress forcing on KE variability under near‐term global warming is further confirmed by adopting a linear 1.5 layer reduced‐gravity model forced by wind stress curl field from the present climate model. It is also found that the main contributing longitudinal band for KE index (KEI) moves westward in response to the warmed climate. This results from the northwestward expansion of the large‐scale sea level pressure (SLP) field.  aPublisher supplied data  a41490640cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a41521091cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  aU1406401cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a41506009cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a2013CB956201cNational Basic Research Program of China  a2016YFC1402606cMajor Project of the Ministry of Science and Technology of China 3aclimate 3aclimate models 3ageophysics 3alatitude 3aresearch 3asea level 3awind stress1 aJing, Zhao1 aChen, Zhaohui1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0830-23321 aWu, Lixin0 tJournal of geophysical research.g2017 Apr., v. 122, no. 4 p.2871-2883dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:27942x2169-92757nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/2016JC0124683Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02757naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002000148245007400168300001600242520121000258592002801468650000801496650001501504650001501519650003201534650002101566650001901587650001401606650001401620650001101634650001701645650001601662650001201678650001301690653002201703653001001725653001001735653002201745700001401767700001301781700001601794700001501810700001601825700001501841700001701856700001301873700001301886700001701899700005501916773014001971856008302111852000902194655001202203IND60782020920221120165154.0220802e20220917xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078202092DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbrc.2022.07.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuang, Miaoling10aPolβ modulates the expression of type I interferon via STING pathway  ap. 137-143.  aDNA Polymerase β (Polβ) is a key enzyme in base excision repair (BER), which is very important in maintaining the stability and integrity of the genome. Mutant Polβ is closely associated with carcinogenesis. However, Polβ is highly expressed in most cancers, but the underlying mechanism is not well understood. Here, we found that breast cancer cells MCF-7 with Polβ knockdown exhibited high levels of type I interferon and were easily eliminated by natural killer (NK) cells.Similarly, Polβ-mutant (R137Q) mice exhibited chronic inflammation symptoms in multiple organs and upregulated type I interferon levels. Further results showed that Polβ deficiency caused more DNA damage accumulation in cells and triggered the leakage of damaged DNA into the cytoplasm, which activated the STING/IRF3 pathway, promoted phosphorylated IRF3 translocating into the nucleus and enhanced the expression of type I interferon and proinflammatory cytokines. In addition, this effect could be eliminated by Polβ overexpression, STING inhibitor or STING knockdown. Taken together, our findings provide mechanistic insight into the role of Polβ in cancers by linking DNA repair and the inflammatory STING pathway.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aDNA damage 3aDNA repair 3aDNA-directed DNA polymerase 3abreast neoplasms 3acarcinogenesis 3acytokines 3acytoplasm 3agenome 3ainflammation 3ainterferons 3amutants 3aresearch 0aDNA polymerase β 0adsDNA 0aSTING 0aType I interferon1 aWu, Ding,1 aLiu, Rui1 aWang, Meina1 aShi, Munan1 aXin, Jingyu1 aShao, Shan1 aZhao, Xingqi1 aMa, Ying1 aGu, Lili1 aGuo, Zhigang1 aPan, Feiyan1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3990-618X0 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2022 Sept. 17, v. 621 p.137-143dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl46848x0006-291X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2022.07.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01875naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002200139245005600161300001600217500001100233520095400244592002801198650001701226650001401243650001101257650001401268650001701282650002301299650001301322650001601335773011601351856007301467852000901540655001201549IND60587351820221121034055.0180102e201707  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058735182DNAL7 a10.1111/nph.143332doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHarrison, C.

Polar auxin transport by PIN proteins is a primary determinant of flowering plant branching patterns regulating both branch initiation and branch outgrowth. Several lines of experimental evidence suggest that PIN‐mediated polar auxin transport is a conserved regulator of branching in vascular plant sporophytes. However, the mechanisms of branching and auxin transport and relationships between the two are not well known outside the flowering plants, and the paradigm for PIN‐regulated branching in flowering plants does not fit bryophyte gametophytes. The evidence reviewed here suggests that divergent auxin transport routes contributed to the diversification of branching forms in distinct land plant lineages.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAngiospermae 3aBryophyta 3aauxins 3abranching 3agametophytes 3aplant architecture 3aproteins 3asporophytes0 tnew phytologist.g2017 July, v. 215, no. 2 p.545-551dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl44665x0028-646X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/nph.143333Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02474naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245014700168520096600315592002801281650002601309650002701335650001901362650001201381650002601393650002401419650001501443650002301458650001001481650001001491650002301501650001901524650001501543650001201558653001401570653003001584653002901614653002301643653001601666653002401682700001801706700001701724700005801741773009901799856008501898852000901983655001201992IND60743032220221121033934.0210820e202110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074303222DNAL7 a10.1016/j.funeco.2021.1010912doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Zhenhui10aSoil microbial and chemical responses to foliar Epichloë fungal infection in Lolium perenne, Hordeum brevisubulatum and Achnatherum inebrians  aWe tested whether the host species identity in grass-Epichloë symbioses affected soil chemical and microbial properties.

In E+ soil of all three grasses, available phosphorus was lower whereas total soil nitrogen was higher. Endophyte effects on soil pH, microbial biomass nitrogen, total carbon and organic carbon as well as bacteria and fungi abundance were host species dependent. Ammonia oxidizing bacteria abundance was higher in E+ soils for all species. Bacterial community composition of E+ and E− soils were different only for Lolium perenne with soil pH being the key factor. Fungal community composition of E+ and E− soils was not different for the three grasses.

Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) have attracted wide attention in SR-AOPs due to their outstanding properties (e.g. large surface area, ultra-high porosity, and diversity of material design, etc). Herein, we present an overview of the development and challenges in the synthesis of different types of MOFs, combination of MOFs with other materials (metal centers, conductors, cellulose, etc.) and the construction of catalysts with special structures (core-shell structures and hollow structures) as well as their applications in SR-AOPs for the degradation of organic pollutants. Several review papers have already mentioned the application of a branch of MOFs or simple composites of MOFs in SR-AOP, whereas the latest progresses on the application of MOFs-based materials to SR-AOPs was described rarely. Besides, the degradation mechanism of MOFs as catalysts has not been systematically discussed. To this end, the mechanisms of MOFs and MOF-based materials as catalysts to activate PMS/PS in different systems are analyzed, including radicals and non-radicals pathways. Meanwhile, considering that the research in this field is still in its infancy, a lot of improvements are still needed to effectively promote and implement this technology.  aPublisher supplied data 3acatalysts 3acellulose 3acoordination polymers 3adegradation 3adesign 3afree radicals 3ainfancy 3aoxidation 3apollutants 3aporosity 3aresearch 3asulfates 3asurface area 3asynthesis 3awater 3awater treatment 0aMetal-organic frameworks 0aSulfate radical based advanced oxidation processes 0aOrganic pollutant degradation 0aCatalytic mechanism1 aZhang, Gaoxia1 aYi, Jing1 aCheng, Min1 aLai, Cui1 aXu, Piao1 aZhang, Chen1 aLiu, Yang1 aZhou, Chengyun1 aXue, Wenjing1 aWang, Rongzhong1 aLi, Zhihao1 aChen, Sha0 tChemosphere.g2021 Jan., v. 263 p.127672-dElsevier LtdwJournal:1969x0045-65357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2020.1276723Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02845naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006800148245010500216300001600321520136700337592002801704596008201732596006001814650001301874650002501887650001301912650000901925650001201934650001201946650002201958650001101980650002101991650002102012650001202033650002502045650001002070700007402080700006402154773011402218856008202332852000902414655001202423IND60747819020221116231026.0210820e202109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074781902DNAL7 a10.1007/s40502-021-00602-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPrazeres, Camila Segalla1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2450-970110aBiochemical compounds and enzymatic systems related to tolerance to water deficit of maize seedlings  ap. 402-411.  aThe use of vigorous seeds in drought situations, it may be a strategy to ensure tolerance to drought for better development of the seedlings. It was evaluated whether maize (Zea mays L.) plants from seeds with high vigor possess greater tolerance to water deficit than low vigor seeds and to identify which morphological parameters, biochemical compounds and enzymatic systems are more important for this tolerance. Two maize hybrids with contrasting seed vigor were used: HT1 (high vigor) and HT2 (low vigor). Two pre-established moisture treatments were used one without stress (control, 80% maximum gravimetric moisture) and the other with water restriction (50%). After 20 days, the size and volume of the roots were analyzed and the contents of total soluble proteins, proline and hydrogen peroxide and the activity of antioxidant enzymes, such as superoxide dismutase, catalase and ascorbate peroxidase, were determined for leaf tissue. The HT1 hybrid (high vigor) demonstrated a greater capacity to combat oxidative stress with the accumulation of proline and increased activity of antioxidant enzymes, which may be indicative of tolerance to water deficit. The variables that most contributed to the tolerance to water deficit in HT1 were increased activity of the enzymes catalase and ascorbate peroxidase, and a reduction in hydrogen peroxide content.  aPublisher supplied data  a00cFundação de Amparo à Pesquisa e Inovação do Estado de Santa Catarina  a00cPrograma de Bolsas de Monitoria de Pós-Graduação 3aZea mays 3aascorbate peroxidase 3acatalase 3acorn 3adrought 3ahybrids 3ahydrogen peroxide 3aleaves 3aoxidative stress 3aplant physiology 3aproline 3asuperoxide dismutase 3avigor1 aCoelho, Cileide Maria Medeiros1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9528-73711 aSouza, Clovis Arruda1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0037-15090 tPlant Physiology Reports.g2021 Sept., v. 26, no. 3 p.402-411dSpringer IndiawJournal:27098x2662-253X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s40502-021-00602-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02324naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001200151245012300163300001600286520092200302592002801224650001401252650001801266650003201284650001101316650002601327650002701353650001601380650000901396650001501405650001301420653002601433653002401459653002401483653003601507653000801543700001401551700001801565700001901583700001401602700001801616700001501634773011001649856008601759852000901845655001201854IND60543229320221122091829.0190410e201408  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054322932DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodres.2014.05.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMa, Fei10aMultispectral imaging for rapid and non-destructive determination of aerobic plate count (APC) in cooked pork sausages  ap. 902-908.  aTo improve the sanitary quality and safety evaluation of meat products, we present a rapid and non-destructive method based on multispectral imaging in the visible and near infrared (NIR) regions to determine the aerobic plate count (APC) in cooked pork sausages. Multispectral images of 75 samples were captured during storage at 4°C for 28days, and the spectra among the acquired images were extracted and analyzed. Calibration method of partial least square regression (PLSR) was applied to establish prediction models for APC, which presented a good determination coefficient (R2) of 0.89. The prediction equation was then transferred to each pixel in the image for visualizing the distribution of APC of the samples. These results suggested that multispectral imaging could be a promising tool in developing rapid and non-destructive APC measurement application, which is highly desirable for the meat industry.  aPublisher supplied data 3aequations 3aleast squares 3alivestock and meat industry 3amodels 3amultispectral imagery 3anondestructive methods 3aplate count 3apork 3aprediction 3asausages 0aMultispectral imaging 0aCooked pork sausage 0aAerobic plate count 0aPartial least square regression 0aMap1 aYao, Jing1 aXie, Tingting1 aLiu, Changhong1 aChen, Wei1 aChen, Conggui1 aZheng, Lei0 tFood research international.g2014 Aug., v. 62 p.902-908dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl48420x0963-99697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodres.2014.05.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03399naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001400150245012300164500001900287520177700306592002802083650001702111650002002128650001902148650001902167650001202186650001602198650001902214650001802233650001302251650001902264650000902283650001802292650002402310653001802334653002002352653002202372653001702394653003002411653003102441700001502472700001802487700001602505700001402521700002102535700001602556700001602572700001702588700001302605700001602618773010502634856008502739852000902824655001202833IND60695370120221120115530.0200705e202008  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069537012DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envint.2020.1057952doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Yi10aSimulated warming enhances the responses of microbial N transformations to reactive N input in a Tibetan alpine meadow  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aAlpine ecosystems worldwide are characterized with high soil organic carbon (C) and low mineral nitrogen (N). Climate warming has been predicted to stimulate microbial decomposition and N mineralization in these systems. However, experimental results are highly variable, and the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. We examined the effects of warming, N input, and their combination on soil N pools and N-cycling microbes in a field manipulation experiment. Special attention was directed to the ammonia-oxidizing bacteria and archaea, and their mediated N-cycling processes (transformation rates and N₂O emissions) in the third plant growing season after the treatments were initiated. Nitrogen input (12 g m⁻² y⁻¹) alone significantly increased soil mineral N pools and plant N uptake, and stimulated the growth of AOB and N₂O emissions in the late growing season. While warming (by 1.4 °C air temperature) alone did not have significant effects on most parameters, it amplified the effects of N input on soil N concentrations and AOB abundance, eliciting a chain reaction that increased nitrification potential (+83%), soil NO₃⁻-N (+200%), and N₂O emissions (+412%) across the whole season. Also, N input reduced AOB diversity but increased the dominance of genus Nitrosospira within the AOB community, corresponding to the increased N₂O emissions. These results showed that a small temperature increase in soil may significantly enhance N losses through NO₃⁻ leaching and N₂O emissions when mineral N becomes available. These findings suggest that interactions among global change factors may predominantly affect ammonia-oxidizing microbes and their mediated N-cycling processes in alpine ecosystems under future climate change scenarios.  aPublisher supplied data 3aNitrosospira 3aair temperature 3aalpine meadows 3abiodegradation 3aclimate 3aenvironment 3amineralization 3anitrification 3anitrogen 3anitrogen cycle 3asoil 3asoil minerals 3asoil organic carbon 0aAlpine meadow 0aClimate warming 0aNitrogen addition 0aN2O emission 0aAmmonia-oxidizing archaea 0aAmmonia-oxidizing bacteria1 aZhang, Nan1 aYin, Jingjing1 aZhao, Yexin1 aYang, Fei1 aJiang, Zhongquan1 aTao, Jinjin1 aYan, Xuebin1 aQiu, Yunpeng1 aGuo, Hui1 aHu, Shuijin0 tEnvironment international.g2020 Aug., v. 141 p.105795-dElsevier LtdwJournal:6374x0160-41207nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envint.2020.1057953Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02952naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100006200147245017300209300001600382520124000398592002801638650002301666650001501689650001201704650001001716650001001726650001301736650002201749650001901771650001401790653002001804653001401824653002301838653001801861653002001879653001401899653002201913653002001935700002201955700001901977700002001996700002102016700001802037700001702055700002002072700001902092700001902111700001802130773017102148856008202319852000902401655001202410IND60782021120220830000000.0220830e202208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078202112DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cnd.2022.06.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDelestre, Fabienne1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5027-505910aIntérêt d’un programme d’accompagnement en ligne associant conseils nutritionnels et pratiques d’une activité physique en post-cancer : étude pilote ONCOlife  ap. 284-292.  aFor cancer survivors, optimizing nutritional habits and physical activity are an integral part of treatment recommendations to prevent recurrence and cardiometabolic disease. Hence, access to nutrition and physical activity specialists in certain territories can be difficult, which is why connected health seems to be a promising path. We have tested the web based ONCOlife program (duration: 8weeks), including 47 patients [mean age: 56 y (10); 69% of women] who were either cured or in remission from cancer (lung, n=7; breast, n=20; prostate, n=9; colon, n=11). Patients were recruited via patient associations and oncologists. The program includes automated thematic courses and live discussions with experts. The evaluation of the program has showed a significant improvement in eating habits (adherence to Mediterranean diet, PREDIMED questionnaire) and the practice of physical activity (IPAQ questionnaire). Adherence to the program (frequency of using the web-application) was generally satisfactory (retention rate, 79%) and the satisfaction questionnaire (n=45) showed a strong interest of volunteers in the program. ONCOlife is a promising program that will very likely help to improve the health of patients after cancer.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMediterranean diet 3aautomation 3abreasts 3acolon 3alungs 3apatients 3aphysical activity 3aquestionnaires 3aremission 0aApplication web 0aNutrition 0aActivité physique 0aAprès cancer 0aWeb-application 0aNutrition 0aPhysical activity 0aCancer survivor1 aPicon, Emmanuelle1 aMourah, Fadila1 aGicquel, Audrey1 aGounan, Valérie1 aGoujon, Gaël1 aOuzaid, Idir1 aBresset, Arnaud1 aKadouch, Diana1 aRoussel, Ronan1 aHansel, Boris0 tCahiers de nutrition et de diététique.g2022 Aug., v. 57, no. 4 p.284-292dElsevier Masson SASaSociété française de nutritionwJournal:jnl17549x0007-99607nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cnd.2022.06.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01560naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100006300140245013700203300001800340520026400358592002800622650001400650650002300664650002300687650002400710650001300734650001800747650003000765650001400795650002000809700001400829700001200843700001300855700001500868700001500883700002000898700001500918773013400933856007401067852000901141655001201150IND60617452620221118065021.0181025e20180313xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061745262DNAL7 a10.1039/c7cc09918e2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhangThese authors contributed equally to this work., Yong10aPorous organic cage stabilised palladium nanoparticles: efficient heterogeneous catalysts for carbonylation reaction of aryl halides  ap. 2796-2799.  aPorous organic cage stabilised palladium nanoparticles were successfully prepared using methanol as a mild reductant.

In potential its extant provides an opportunity to expand the known effective realm of grain weathering. Specifically, uncertainty exists as to whether or not glacial-period frost weathering could even occur at such considerable depths, which is well outside an active-layer range (i.e., beyond the currently acknowledged domain of grain weathering). Sand deposits collected at a 410.70–396.75 m depth were subjected to grain-size analysis, then 0.5–0.8 mm quartz-grain surfaces were analysed under stereoscopic and scanning electron microscopy. The obtained results indicate that these relict-permafrost grains were both mechanically and chemically weathered. Mechanical weathering of quartz grains is identified as P- & F-type weathering. The former is associated with an increase in stress generated both by overlying ice-sheet masses and permafrost degradation. Here mechanical weathering was facilitated by the presence of well-sorted sediment, rounded or well-rounded grains, and high porosity. Its effects are microtextures such as breakage blocks and conchoidal fractures. F-type weathering is/was generated by freezing water in various sorts of cavities and cracks. Weathering is directly associated with the presence of permafrost at this depth. Additionally, chemical weathering is recorded on quartz-grain surfaces in the form of a ragged discontinuous coating. It has been proven here that weathering of quartz grains is not just a near-surface phenomenon, but also occurs deep below Earth's surface.  aPublisher supplied data 3afrost 3apermafrost 3aporosity 3aquartz 3asand 3auncertainty 3aCentral European region 3aPoland 0aRelict permafrost 0aThermal inversion 0aFrost micro-weathering 0aSuwałki anorthosite massif1 aRychel, Joanna1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1079-95091 aHonczaruk, Marcin0 tQuaternary international.g2021 Dec. 20, v. 605-606 p.65-80dElsevier LtdwJournal:12411x1040-61827nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.quaint.2020.12.0363Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02942naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001500155245012600170500001400296520130600310592002801616650001901644650001901663650001801682650002201700650001901722650002201741650001401763650001101777650001201788650001801800650001101818650002001829650001601849650001201865650001301877650001101890650000901901651001501910653001201925653000901937653001101946653002001957653001701977653003201994653003002026653001602056653001002072653001702082700002302099700001802122700002202140773009102162856009002253852000902343655001202352IND60707410420221120221510.0201209e202101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070741042DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2020.1277802doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWu, Fangli10aSeason-dependent effects of ZnO nanoparticles and elevated temperature on bioenergetics of the blue mussel Mytilus edulis  aNAL-light  aInput of ZnO nanoparticles (nZnO) from multiple sources have raised concerns about the potential toxic effects on estuarine and coastal organisms. The toxicity of nZnO and its interaction with common abiotic stressors (such as elevated temperature) are not well understood in these organisms. Here, we examined the bioenergetics responses of the blue mussel Mytilus edulis exposed for 21 days to different concentrations of nZnO or dissolved zinc (Zn²⁺) (0, 10, 100 μg l⁻¹) and two temperatures (ambient and 5 °C warmer) in winter and summer. Exposure to nZnO had little effect on the protein and lipid levels, but led to a significant depletion of carbohydrates and a decrease in the electron transport system (ETS) activity. Qualitatively similar but weaker effects were found for dissolved Zn. In winter mussels, elevated temperature (15 °C) led to elevated protein and lipid levels increasing the total energy content of the tissues. In contrast, elevated temperature (20 °C) resulted in a decrease in the lipid and carbohydrate levels and suppressed ETS in summer mussels. These data indicate that moderate warming in winter (but not in summer) might partially compensate for the bioenergetics stress caused by nZnO toxicity in M. edulis from temperate areas such as the Baltic Sea.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMytilus edulis 3aabiotic stress 3acarbohydrates 3aelectron transfer 3aenergy content 3aenergy metabolism 3aestuaries 3alipids 3amussels 3ananoparticles 3asummer 3atemperate zones 3atemperature 3atissues 3atoxicity 3awinter 3azinc 3aBaltic Sea 0aWarming 0anZnO 0aMussel 0aEnergy reserves 0aMitochondria 0aElectron transport activity 0aOxidative phosphorylation 0aProton leak 0aLipid 0aCarbohydrate1 aSokolov, Eugene P.1 aDellwig, Olaf1 aSokolova, Inna M.0 tChemosphere.g2021 Jan., v. 263 p.127780-dElsevier LtdwJournal:1969x0045-65357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2020.1277803Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02945naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100005600152245010900208520167200317592002801989650002402017650002002041650001602061650001502077650001202092650003502104650001702139651001102156653002402167653003702191653002002228653002002248653001602268700002202284700002602306700002102332773009802353856008702451852000902538655001202547IND60684173520221116223401.0200221e20200401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068417352DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apenergy.2020.1146512doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRiley, David1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9829-004X12aA social, environmental and economic evaluation protocol for potential gas hydrate exploitation projects  aThere is increasing global interest in the potential commercial development of methane gas hydrate as a widespread and abundant unconventional source of natural gas. Previous work has focussed on understanding the nature and distribution of the resource, and potential recovery technology, neglecting assessment of the associated social, economic and environmental consequences. This gap needs to be addressed for any commercial gas hydrate development business case to succeed. Here we develop a multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) protocol of gas hydrate development using the ELECTRE III method. Our protocol proposes criteria that evaluate the social, environmental and economic impacts of gas hydrate development proposals, which are weighted to represent the priorities of six identified stakeholder groups. We have tested the protocol on potential commercial gas hydrate development in Alaska through a series of interviews. Our results show that there is no universal preference structure, even within stakeholder groups, indicating that buy-in from all groups is a complex compromise. However, there are two fundamentally opposing groups, one composed of individuals from governmental and industry backgrounds who prioritise economic criteria, and another represented by members of the local community and environmental advocates who prioritise social and environmental criteria. The protocol concludes that gas hydrate development in Alaska is unlikely to be supported under present-day conditions. This work provides the first structured foundation for comprehensive assessment of future development proposals of gas hydrate or other natural resources.  aPublisher supplied data 3aeconomic evaluation 3aeconomic impact 3agas hydrate 3ainterviews 3amethane 3amulti-criteria decision making 3astakeholders 3aAlaska 0aNatural gas hydrate 0aMulti-criteria decision analysis 0aDecision-making 0aEnergy planning 0aELECTRE III1 aSchaafsma, Marije1 aMarin-Moreno, Héctor1 aMinshull, Tim A.0 tApplied energy.g2020 Apr. 01, v. 263 p.114651-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11876x0306-26197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2020.1146513Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02396naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100006100142245007800203300001800281500002000299520130600319592002801625650001101653650001501664650000901679650002101688650001301709651001401722700006001736700001701796700002801813773013101841856007701972852000902049655001202058IND60789619720221121062839.0220822e201704  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078961972DNAL7 a10.1002/2017JC0127292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFalina, Anastasia1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5435-460310aObserved basin‐wide propagation of Mediterranean water in the Black Sea  ap. 3141-3151.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aMediterranean water entering the Black Sea through the Bosphorus Strait forms middepth intrusions that contribute to the salt, heat, and volume balances of the sea, ventilate its water column at intermediate depths and restrain the upward flux of hydrogen sulfide from deeper layers. Despite the importance for the Black Sea environment, the circulation of Mediterranean‐origin water in the basin is fundamentally underexplored. Here we use hydrographic data collected from ships and Argo profiling floats to identify pathways of the Mediterranean intrusions in the general circulation system of the sea. While earlier the intrusions were observed primarily near the Bosphorus Strait, we present an evidence for their intermittent extensive propagation throughout the basin. We find that the main conduit for the intrusions is the southern limb of the Rim Current that carries the intruded water from the Bosphorus Strait eastward. A part of this eastward flow recirculates cyclonically into the interior of the sea, where traces of the intrusions gradually disappear because of mixing. We put forward the hypothesis that the formation of the most prominent intrusions is associated with strong cyclonic storms over the Bosphorus Strait, which lead to abnormally large influx of Mediterranean water.  aPublisher supplied data 3abasins 3ageophysics 3aheat 3ahydrogen sulfide 3aresearch 3aBlack Sea1 aSarafanov, Artem1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8683-25181 aÖzsoy, Emin1 aUtku Turunçoğlu, Ufuk0 tJournal of geophysical research.g2017 Apr., v. 122, no. 4 p.3141-3151dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:27942x2169-92757nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/2017JC0127293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01868naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100003100139245007700170300001600247500001100263520097800274592002801252650001401280650001201294650001401306650001201320650002001332700001601352773011601368856007301484852000901557655001201566IND60587352220221121023229.0180102e201707  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058735222DNAL7 a10.1111/nph.143242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHetherington, Alexander J.14aThe evolution of lycopsid rooting structures: conservatism and disparity  ap. 538-544.  aREVIEW  aContents 538 I. 538 II. 539 III. 541 IV. 542 543 References 543 SUMMARY: The evolution of rooting structures was a crucial event in Earth's history, increasing the ability of plants to extract water, mine for nutrients and anchor above‐ground shoot systems. Fossil evidence indicates that roots evolved at least twice among vascular plants, in the euphyllophytes and independently in the lycophytes. Here, we review the anatomy and evolution of lycopsid rooting structures. Highlighting recent discoveries made with fossils we suggest that the evolution of lycopsid rooting structures displays two contrasting patterns – conservatism and disparity. The structures termed roots have remained structurally similar despite hundreds of millions of years of evolution – an example of remarkable conservatism. By contrast, and over the same time period, the organs that give rise to roots have diversified, resulting in the evolution of numerous novel and disparate organs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aevolution 3afossils 3anutrients 3arooting 3avascular plants1 aDolan, Liam0 tnew phytologist.g2017 July, v. 215, no. 2 p.538-544dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl44665x0028-646X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/nph.143243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03307naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001600148245009900164300001600263520167800279592002801957650002401985650001602009650001702025650001202042650001102054650001702065650001802082650004102100650001702141650001802158650002302176650002002199650001902219650001802238650001302256650000902269650002102278650001802299650001702317650002102334650001502355650002602370650001302396650001702409700001702426700006002443700005702503773011402560856008202674852000902756655001202765IND60747819520221116230911.0210820e202109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074781952DNAL7 a10.1007/s40502-021-00595-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRani, Suman10aGC–MS based metabolite profiling of medicinal plant-Catharanthus roseus under cadmium stress  ap. 491-502.  aAlteration in metabolite levels in response to heavy metal exposure plays an important role in sustaining metal stress in plants. The objective of the present study was to examine the change in metabolite profile of medicinal plant- Catharanthus roseus in response to heavy metal cadmium (Cd), using gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC–MS). A total of 78 Cd responsive metabolites were identified in control and cadmium treated samples. These included fatty acids, alkaloids, terpenoids, phytosterols and other miscellaneous compounds. An increase in saturated fatty acids such as myristic acid, palmitic acid, adipic acid, stearic acid, decanoic acid, tridecanoic acid, pentadecanoic acid, octadecanoic acid and decrease in unsaturated fatty acids such as linoleic acid, 9-hexadecenoic acid and 9, 12-octadecadienoic acid indicated lipid peroxidation in treated plants. Higher malondialdehyde content and ultrastructural changes in chloroplasts in treated plants confirmed these results. Elevated levels of alkaloids vindolinine, catharanthine, vindoline, tabersonine, nicotine, coronaridine, vidorosine indicated effect on metabolic pathways including the monoterpenoid indole alkaloids pathway. Other responsive metabolites included terpenes like caryophyllene, campestrin, phytol, neophytadiene, cedrol and silicone oil in addition to isoprenoids and polyamines. These metabolites have known antioxidant properties and are employed by plants to overcome oxidative stress and maintain membrane integrity. Overall, metabolite profiling demonstrated that the Cd tolerance can be attributed to the differential accumulation of the secondary metabolites in C. roseus.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCatharanthus roseus 3aadipic acid 3aantioxidants 3acadmium 3acedrol 3achloroplasts 3adecanoic acid 3agas chromatography-mass spectrometry 3aheavy metals 3alinoleic acid 3alipid peroxidation 3amalondialdehyde 3amonoterpenoids 3amyristic acid 3anicotine 3aoils 3aoxidative stress 3apalmitic acid 3aphytosterols 3aplant physiology 3apolyamines 3asecondary metabolites 3asilicone 3astearic acid1 aSingh, Vinay1 aSharma, Manoj K.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4768-87331 aSisodia, Rama1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3401-04480 tPlant Physiology Reports.g2021 Sept., v. 26, no. 3 p.491-502dSpringer IndiawJournal:27098x2662-253X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s40502-021-00595-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03004naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001800143245012100161300001900282500001900301520142100320592002801741650002201769650002001791650002201811650001801833650001301851653001701864653001501881700002201896700002101918700001501939700002501954700002301979700002902002700001902031700001902050700001702069700002702086700002302113700002502136700001802161700002602179700002402205700002402229700002502253773012202278856007702400852000902477655001202486IND60711054420221120092127.0200916e20200901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071105442DNAL7 a10.1089/chi.2020.01382doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKing, Heather10aChildhood Obesity Evidence Base Project: Methods for Taxonomy Development for Application in Taxonomic Meta-Analysis  ap. S2-7-S2-20.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aMeta-analysis has been used to examine the effectiveness of childhood obesity prevention efforts, yet traditional conventional meta-analytic methods restrict the kinds of studies included, and either narrowly define mechanisms and agents of change, or examine the effectiveness of whole interventions as opposed to the specific actions that comprise interventions. Taxonomic meta-analytic methods widen the aperture of what can be included in a meta-analysis data set, allowing for inclusion of many types of interventions and study designs. The National Collaborative on Childhood Obesity Research Childhood Obesity Evidence Base (COEB) project focuses on interventions intended to prevent childhood obesity in children 2–5 years old who have an outcome measure of BMI. The COEB created taxonomies, anchored in the Social Ecological Model, which catalog specific outcomes, intervention components, intended recipients, and contexts of policies, initiatives, and interventions conducted at the individual, interpersonal, organizational, community, and societal level. Taxonomies were created by discovery from the literature itself using grounded theory. This article describes the process used for a novel taxonomic meta-analysis of childhood obesity prevention studies between the years 2010 and 2019. This method can be applied to other areas of research, including obesity prevention in additional populations.  aPublisher supplied data 3achildhood obesity 3adata collection 3aecological models 3ameta-analysis 3ataxonomy 0aintervention 0aprevention1 aMagnus, Mackenzie1 aHedges, Larry V.1 aCyr, Chris1 aYoung-Hyman, Deborah1 aKettel Khan, Laura1 aScott-Sheldon, Lori A.J.1 aSaul, Jason A.1 aArteaga, Sonia1 aCawley, John1 aEconomos, Christina D.1 aHaire-Joshu, Debra1 aHunter, Christine M.1 aLee, Bruce Y.1 aKumanyika, Shiriki K.1 aRitchie, Lorrene D.1 aRobinson, Thomas N.1 aSchwartz, Marlene B.0 tChildhood obesity.g2020 Sept. 01, v. 16, no.

Glyphosate was applied at 0.9 kg ai/ha at each of the three crop development stages, as determined by seed moisture content (SMC), to determinate (‘‘Ascona’’ and ‘‘Radley’’) and indeterminate (‘‘Miko’’ and ‘‘Trapper’’) cultivars. Applying glyphosate when the SMC was less than 30%% had little to no effect on seedling emergence but reduced seedling shoot fresh weight in two of six experiments. Applying glyphosate at SMC above 40%% reduced seedling emergence and shoot fresh weight in two and three of the six experiments, respectively. Reductions in seedling emergence and shoot fresh weight were greater from seeds collected from the top than from seeds collected from the bottom one-third of sprayed plants. Differences in response between determinate and indeterminate cultivars occurred, but there was no consistent trend. Given the variable maturity in most fields and on individual pea plants, applications of preharvest glyphosate to peas destined for seed production may decrease seed germination and biomass accumulation.Nomenclature: Glyphosate; field pea, Pisum sativum L. ‘‘Ascona’’, ‘‘Miko’’, ‘‘Radley’’, ‘‘Trapper’’.Additional index words: Crop desiccation, determinate and indeterminate pea cultivars, harvest aid.Abbreviations: SMC, seed moisture content.  aPublisher supplied data 3aseed germination 3acultivars 3aseedling growth 3apeas 3aseeds 3aseedlings 3abiomass production 3apreharvest treatment 3aglyphosate 3aseedling emergence 3awater content 3afield experimentation 3aPisum sativum 3ashoots 0aLacombe1 aDARWENT, A.

In this work, the feasibility of separating infected from wholesome wheat grains by using fluidized bed technologies was evaluated. The pro posed separation equipment was of the batch type and fluidization was attained via direct air injec tion into the grain bed. Minimum fluidization rates were determined and effects of infected grain composition in the bed were studied. The experimental results showed that the separation of infected grains was quite possible with small losses of wholesome wheat grains. A quantitative characteriza tion of the separation process was made by determining the separation kinetics from the available experimental data. Separation kinetics were shown to be useful for estimating the equipment operat ing time to attain an allowed level of grain infection, as established by the Mexican government for the commercialization of wheat.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTilletia indica 3aTriticum aestivum 3aair 3abreadmaking 3acommercialization 3afinancial economics 3afluidized beds 3agrain composition 3awheat 0akarnal bunt 0awheat grains 0aseparation 0afluidization 0akinetics1 aVernon-Carter, E.J.1 aVizcarra-Mendoza, M.0 tFood science and technology international.g2000 Apr., v. 6, no. 2 p.137-143dSage PublicationswJournal:jnl3949853x1082-01327nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1082013200006002083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03231naa a2200649 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002800151245010900179300001400288520150100302592002801803650001201831650001601843650001601859650001201875650002201887650002601909650001301935650002201948650001401970650001101984650002001995650001902015650001102034650001502045650001702060650001202077650001302089650001002102650001402112650001102126650001202137650001802149650001702167653000802184653000902192653000802201653000802209653000902217653000802226653000802234653000802242653001402250653001902264653001902283653001502302700003202317700001802349773010702367856008602474852000902560655001202569IND60525867920221116162255.0190319e20160126xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052586792DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scienta.2015.11.0282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKhoyerdi, Farooq Fahimi10aChanges in some physiological and osmotic parameters of several pistachio genotypes under drought stress  ap. 44-51.  aDrought is one of the main adverse environmental factors, obviously has an impact on plant growth and development. Many adaptive strategies have been developed in plants for dealing with water stress, among which osmoregulation is one of the most important factors of drought-tolerance in plants. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of drought stress on the physiological and osmotic parameters of several pistachio genotypes. A completely randomized design was applied with a factorial arrangement of two factors: drought (0, −0.5, −1 and −2MPa) and genotypes (Abareqi, Badami–Rize–Zarand, Qazvini, and Sarakhs) at four replications. The results indicated that drought stress reduced shoot and root dry weight (RDW), leaf area, leaf relative water content (RWC), total chlorophyll (TChl), carotenoids, total soluble proteins (TSP) and increased proline, glycine betaine, total soluble carbohydrate (TSC), sucrose, phenol, hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and malondialdehyde (MDA) content in roots and leaves of four genotypes. The genotypes have differently responded to water stress. The highest and lowest of above parameters in the roots and leaves of pistachio seedlings under drought condition were found in Badami–Rize–Zarand and Abareqi genotypes, respectively. According to the results, Badami–Rize–Zarand was presented more resistance to drought stress as accumulated more osmolytes and produced better water relations and dry weights under drought stress.  aPublisher supplied data 3abetaine 3acarotenoids 3achlorophyll 3adrought 3adrought tolerance 3aenvironmental factors 3agenotype 3ahydrogen peroxide 3aleaf area 3aleaves 3amalondialdehyde 3aosmoregulation 3aphenol 3apistachios 3aplant growth 3aproline 3aproteins 3aroots 3aseedlings 3ashoots 3asucrose 3awater content 3awater stress 0aRWC 0aTChl 0aTSP 0aTSC 0aH2O2 0aMDA 0aRDW 0aSDW 0aPistachio 0aDrought stress 0aOsmoregulation 0aDry weight1 aShamshiri, Mohammad Hossein1 aEstaji, Ahmad0 tScientia horticulturae.g2016 Jan. 26, v. 198 p.44-51dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4108x0304-42387nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scienta.2015.11.0283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02499naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002500092040001800117100002200135245012200157300001600279520144100295592002801736650002201764650001301786650000901799650001501808650002301823650001301846650001601859650001501875650000901890700002201899700002701921700002101948773008601969856007302055852000902128655001202137IND4477680220221123025436.0151127e200310  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447768022DNAL7 a10.1614/WT02-732doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aARMEL, GREGORY R.10aUse of Mixtures of Mesotrione, Imazethapyr, and Imazethapyr plus Imazapyr in Imidazolinone-Resistant Corn (Zea mays)1  ap. 674-679.  aField studies were conducted in 1999, 2000, and 2001 to evaluate mesotrione at 105 and 210 g ai/ha alone and in mixtures with imazethapyr at 70 g ai/ha and the prepackage mixture of imazethapyr at 47 g/ha plus imazapyr at 16 g ai/ha postemergence.

There are at least 12 species of hymenopteran parasitoids attacking eggs of Agrilus beetles and 56 species (36 genera), attacking Agrilus larvae infesting various host plants in North America, Asia, and Europe. While most of the egg parasitoids (9 species) belong to the family Encyrtidae, a majority of the larval parasitoids are members of five families: Braconidae (24 species/11 genera), Eulophidae (8 species/4 genera), Ichneumonidae (10 species/9 genera), and Eupelmidae (6 species/5 genera). The highest rate of Agrilus egg parasitism (>50%) was exerted by encyrtid wasps (4 species) in North America, Asia, and Europe. In contrast, the highest rate of Agrilus larval parasitism (>50%) was caused by species in two genera of braconids: Atanycolus (North America) and Spathius (Asia), and one eulophid genus, Tetrastichus (Asia and Europe). Reported rate of Agrilus larval parasitism ichneumonids was frequent in North America, but generally low (<1%). Potential for success in biological control of emerald ash borer (Agrilus planipennis Fairmaire) in the USA with North American native parasitoids and old-association Asian parasitoids is discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAgrilus planipennis 3aEncyrtidae 3aEupelmidae 3aIchneumonidae 3aSpathius 3aTetrastichus 3abiological control 3aeggs 3ahost plants 3alarvae 3aparasitism 3aparasitoids 3aCanada 3aChina 3aJapan 3aKorean Peninsula 3aRussia 3aUnited States1 aDuan, Jian J.1 aFuester, Roger W.1 aHoddle, Mark1 aVan Driesche, Roy0 tPsyche.g2012, v. 2012dCambridge Entomological Club]x0033-26157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1155%2F2012%2F8139293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02701naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002700148245014900175300001800324520110700342592002801449596009601477596009601573596010101669650001501770650000901785650001601794650001401810650001401824650001801838650001701856650001901873650001601892650001701908650002101925700002301946700003101969700006502000773012202065856008302187852000902270655001202279IND60787264220220808000000.0220808e20220708xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078726422DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.biomac.2c005932doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKovačič, Janja Majer10aUse of Emulsion-Templated, Highly Porous Polyelectrolytes for In Vitro Germination of Chickpea Embryos: a New Substrate for Soilless Cultivation  ap. 3452-3457.  aThe application of highly porous and 3D interconnected microcellular polyelectrolyte polyHIPE (PE-PH) monoliths based on (3-acrylamidopropyl)-trimethylammonium chloride as soilless cultivation substrates for in vitro embryo culture is discussed. The embryo axes isolated from chickpea seeds are inoculated onto the surface of the monoliths and allowed to germinate. Germination study show that the newly disclosed PE-PH substrate performs much better than the conventionally used agar as the germination percentage, shoot and root length, fresh and dry weight as well as the number of leaves are enhanced. The PE-PHs exhibit a higher absorption capacity of the plant growth medium, that is, 36 g·g–¹ compared to agar, that is, 20 g·g–¹, and also survive autoclaving conditions without failing. The key advantage over standard agar substrates is that they can be reused several times and also without prior sterilization. These results suggest that PE-PHs with exceptional absorption/retention properties and robustness have great potential as soilless substrates for in vitro plant cultivation.  aPublisher supplied data  aN2-0166cJavna Agencija za Raziskovalno Dejavnost RSdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100004329  aP2-0145cJavna Agencija za Raziskovalno Dejavnost RSdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100004329  aNAcMinistrstvo za visoko ?olstvo, znanost in tehnologijodhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100011758 3aabsorption 3aagar 3aautoclaving 3achickpeas 3achlorides 3aculture media 3aelectrolytes 3aembryo culture 3agermination 3aplant growth 3asoilless culture1 aCiringer, Terezija1 aAmbrožič-Dolinšek, Jana1 aKovačič, Sebastijan1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2664-97910 tBiomacromolecules.g2022 July 08, v. 23, no. 8 p.3452-3457dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:12556x1526-46027nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.biomac.2c005933Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02188naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002600146245012400172300001800296520107400314592002801388650001601416650001301432650001201445650002301457650004401480650002201524650001301546650001501559700006401574773013501638856008001773852000901853655001201862IND60606072820221118235417.0180724e20180125xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060607282DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcc.7b111382doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aArunachalam, Vaishali10aGraphene–Solvent Interactions in Nonaqueous Dispersions: 2D ROESY NMR Measurements and Molecular Dynamics Simulations  ap. 1881-1888.  aThe liquid phase exfoliation of graphite by sonication in nonaqueous solvents like N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) provides a simple and scalable route to dispersions of defect-free graphene sheets. The role of the solvent is crucial to the process; it is the interactions of the solvent with the graphene sheets that prevent agglomeration and stabilize the dispersion. Here, we show that the two-dimensional solution nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) technique, rotating frame Overhauser effect spectroscopy (ROESY), provides a molecular signature of these interactions in graphene–NMP dispersions. Significant differences are observed in the spectra of the dispersions as compared to the pure solvent. Using classical molecular dynamics simulations, we show that these differences arise because of the induced layering of solvent molecules with reduced rotational mobility in the vicinity of the graphene sheets. The reduced mobility of solvent molecules in the dispersion as compared to the bulk solvent are reflected as differences in their two-dimensional ROESY NMR.  aPublisher supplied data 3adispersions 3agraphene 3aliquids 3amolecular dynamics 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3asimulation models 3asolvents 3asonication1 aVasudevan, Sukumaran1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5059-60980 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2018 Jan. 25, v. 122, no. 3 p.1881-1888dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23573x1932-74557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcc.7b111383Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03377naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002300152245009600175300001600271520198300287592002802270650000802298650001202306650001102318650001902329650001902348650001502367650001302382650002902395650001802424650001402442650002402456650001102480650001702491650001002508650001602518653001902534653002402553653003002577653002102607700002402628700006102652773009802713856008702811852000902898655001202907IND60611961620221119143440.0200621e20181101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061196162DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apenergy.2018.08.0572doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMansir, Ibrahim B.10aOxy-fuel combustion in a two-pass oxygen transport reactor for fire tube boiler application  ap. 828-840.  aApplication of oxy-fuel combustion carbon capture technology to power plants is currently getting special attention as one of the means of curtailing CO₂ emission responsible for the current climate change. The key concept of oxy-fuel combustion technology is the use of pure oxygen, obtained via air separation technologies, for combustion instead of air. Currently, the membrane separation technology is gaining high momentum due to its flexibility for different applications. Integrating oxygen transport membrane reactors to fire tube boilers has the prospects of concurrent permeation of oxygen, in-situ combustion as well as steam generation within a confined space, thus, potential for more compact boilers. Despite the in-situ prospects of the Oxygen Transport Membrane (OTM) integration, it comes with the heat transfer design challenges due to fragile nature of the membrane as well as maintaining the required operating temperatures for optimum performance. Hence the geometry as well as the heat transfer characteristics need to be well designed and the system needs to be thoroughly investigated for optimum performance. In this study, numerical modeling of a two-pass oxygen transport membrane reactor for oxygen permeation and oxy-fuel combustion characteristics analyses for fire tube boilers application was conducted. It was found that, for the non-reactive conditions, the effects of gases inlet temperature and mass flow rates on oxygen permeation along the length of the membrane was meager within the scope of this study. The gases inlet conditions dictate the rate of oxygen permeation under reactive conditions. Also, the gases inlet temperature and mass flow rates control the amount of heat transfer to the load. The sweep gas inlet condition was more critical to the stability of the combustion reaction. The current design of the proposed OTM reactor can deliver power output in the range from 1 to 5 MWe when applied to a typical fire-tube boiler.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3aboilers 3acarbon 3acarbon dioxide 3aclimate change 3acombustion 3ageometry 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3aheat transfer 3amass flow 3amathematical models 3aoxygen 3apower plants 3asteam 3atemperature 0aCarbon capture 0aOxy-fuel combustion 0aOxygen transport membrane 0aFire-tube boiler1 aBen-Mansour, Rached1 aHabib, Mohamed A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3459-14620 tApplied energy.g2018 Nov. 01, v. 229 p.828-840dElsevier LtdwJournal:11876x0306-26197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2018.08.0573Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02752naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002300145245009800168300001600266520140000282592002801682650000801710650001401718650001301732650001401745650001201759650002501771650001601796650002201812650001301834650001401847650001201861650002001873650001001893650001701903651001201920653001401932653001801946653003001964700002001994700001902014700001802033773014302051856007902194852000902273655001202282IND60680984620221121034918.0200113e20191201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068098462DNAL7 a10.2478/ausae-2019-00122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHitter Buru, Timea10aChildren–plant interaction using therapeutic horticulture intervention in a Romanian school  ap. 130-138.  aNature, childhood, and ecopsychology can to be connected in the landscape of a schoolyard. The landscape architecture of the natural environments serves as a wide-open green space for outdoor activities, creating imaginative and inventive urban environmental layouts and connecting natural elements. School-based green experience, either indoor or outdoor, can be a physical and mental activity for children. In the case of individuals, it makes` easy to access a natural, green environment and to be actively involved in a natural setting, developing either social and/or cognitive functions and improving concentration and creativity. Therapeutic horticulture activity, such as planting indoor plants, can be a good experience for developing team work, the proprioceptive (kinase) receptors, affectivity, socialization, permanent care, and responsibility. The potential benefits of ornamental plants for children involved in public education include spending time in outdoor spaces, fresh air and sunshine, experiencing a sense of control, and being exposed to sensory stimulations. Physical and psychological education based on therapeutic horticulture activities in Romanian schools, such as planting and green care, can provide important opportunities for children to develop their attachment to nature, offering sustainable education solutions to an active part of the natural environment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3achildhood 3achildren 3acognition 3aenzymes 3agreen infrastructure 3alandscaping 3aornamental plants 3aplanting 3areceptors 3aschools 3asolar radiation 3ateams 3atherapeutics 3aRomania 0alandscape 0aindoor plants 0anature-based intervention1 aButa, Erzsébet1 aBucur, Gertrud1 aCantor, Maria0 tActa Universitatis Sapientiae.

The analysis is based on a study of present uses of on‐farm computers in Sweden. The results are compared with experiences from other countries. On‐farm computer owners use almost the same management methods as before the computer investment. The main difference is that they used to hire service organizations to do some of the management tasks and now they are doing it by themselves with the aid of the computer. Thus, the on‐farm computer owners have to have the same knowledge level as the service agents and advisers. The use of on‐farm computers has so far affected the processing and storage of data for farm management purposes. A potential next step is communication of data from external computer systems at suppliers, customers, advisers and other farmers as well as automated data capture within the farm. One hindrance for this development is the lack of standardization of data and concept definitions. If this potential was realized the marginal costs of data and information would decrease. It would be profitable to use more information in the farm management, i.e. to develop the farm management functions. When farmers develop their management methods they will need still more knowledge. Service agents and advisers would have to change from doing management tasks for farmers to teaching farmers how to do these tasks and supporting farmers in the interpretation and analysis of information.  aPublisher supplied data 3aautomation 3acomputers 3aconsumers (people) 3afarm management 3afarmers 3afarms 3ahiring 3aSweden0 tAgricultural economics.g1991 July, v. 5, no. 3 p.279-286dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl41636x0169-51507nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1574-0862.1991.tb00158.x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02619naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002200140245011900162300002000281520119200301592002801493650002101521650002701542650002701569650002601596650002901622650002101651650001301672650001701685650001601702650001501718650001501733650001501748650002101763650001301784650003701797700002401834700002401858700002201882700002801904700002201932773012401954856007402078852000902152655001202161IND60667641020221122112127.0190919e20150622xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066764102DNAL7 a10.1039/c5ra08484a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKalinov, Kalin N.10aNovel antibacterial electrospun materials based on polyelectrolyte complexes of a quaternized chitosan derivative  ap. 54517-54526.  aNovel nanofibrous materials composed of polyelectrolyte complexes (PECs) between N,N,N-trimethylchitosan iodide (TMCh) and poly(acrylic acid) (PAA) or poly(2-acrylamido-2-methylpropanesulfonic acid) (PAMPS) were prepared. This was achieved by facile one-pot electrospinning of solutions of the oppositely charged polyelectrolyte partners. It was rendered possible by using a solvent system containing formic acid and/or by adding a strongly ionized low-molecular-weight salt (CaCl₂). Use of formic acid enabled TMCh/PAA nanofibers containing in situ synthesized silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) to be electrospun. The AgNPs had an average diameter of 3.0 ± 0.8 nm and were uniformly distributed in the nanofibers as evidenced by the performed transmission electron microscopic (TEM) analyses. The prepared nanofibers preserved their morphology and did not dissolve in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Hybrid AgNPs-containing PEC nanofibrous materials showed good antibacterial activity against Gram-positive bacteria Staphylococcus aureus and Gram-negative bacteria Escherichia coli and possessed higher efficacy than that of the nanofibers of the same composition without AgNPs and TMCh.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3aGram-negative bacteria 3aGram-positive bacteria 3aStaphylococcus aureus 3aantibacterial properties 3acalcium chloride 3achitosan 3aelectrolytes 3aformic acid 3aionization 3ananofibers 3ananosilver 3apolyacrylic acid 3asolvents 3atransmission electron microscopy1 aIgnatova, Milena G.1 aManolova, Nevena E.1 aMarkova, Nadya D.1 aKarashanova, Daniela B.1 aRashkov, Iliya B.0 tRSC advances.g2015 June 22, v. 5, no. 67 p.54517-54526dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c5ra08484a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03394naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245011900169300001600288520152100304592002801825650002101853650003301874650002301907650002301930650001701953650001601970650003101986650001002017650002602027650001302053650001202066650001602078650001302094650002002107650002802127650003702155650003002192650001802222650003702240650001502277650001502292651001002307653001602317653001002333653002702343653001602370653001802386653001302404653000802417653001202425700002602437700002102463700001902484700001602503700002102519773012202540856008502662852000902747655001202756IND60558873020221120214329.0161118e20161201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055887302DNAL7 a10.1080/03601234.2016.12119122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLimayem, Alya10aMolecular identification and nanoremediation of microbial contaminants in algal systems using untreated wastewater  ap. 868-872.  aWastewater-algal biomass is a promising option to biofuel production. However, microbial contaminants constitute a substantial barrier to algal biofuel yield. A series of algal strains, Nannochloris oculata and Chlorella vulgaris samples (n = 30), were purchased from the University of Texas, and were used for both stock flask cultures and flat-panel vertical bioreactors. A number of media were used for isolation and differentiation of potential contaminants according to laboratory standards (CLSI). Conventional PCR amplification was performed followed by 16S rDNA sequencing to identify isolates at the species level. Nanotherapeutics involving a nanomicellar combination of natural chitosan and zinc oxide (CZNPs) were tested against the microbial lytic groups through Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) tests and Transmission Electronic Microscopy (TEM). Results indicated the presence of Pseudomonas spp., Bacillus pumilus/ safensis, Cellulosimicrobium cellulans, Micrococcus luteus and Staphylococcus epidermidis strains at a substantial level in the wastewater-fed algal reactors. TEM confirmed the effectiveness of CZNPs on the lytic group while the average MICs (mg/mL) detected for the strains, Pseudomonas spp, Micrococcus luteus, and Bacillus pumilus were 0.417, 3.33, and 1.458, respectively. Conclusively, CZNP antimicrobials proved to be effective as inhibitory agents against currently identified lytic microbial group, did not impact algae cells, and shows promise for in situ interventions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacillus pumilus 3aCellulosimicrobium cellulans 3aChlorella vulgaris 3aMicrococcus luteus 3aNannochloris 3aPseudomonas 3aStaphylococcus epidermidis 3aalgae 3aanti-infective agents 3abiofuels 3abiomass 3abioreactors 3achitosan 3afuel production 3amicrobial contamination 3aminimum inhibitory concentration 3apolymerase chain reaction 3aribosomal DNA 3atransmission electron microscopy 3awastewater 3azinc oxide 3aTexas 0aWastewaters 0aalgae 0abacterial contaminants 0aPseudomonas 0ananoparticles 0achitosan 0aZnO 0abiofuel1 aGonzález, Francisco,1 aMicciche, Andrew1 aHaller, Edward1 aNayak, Bina1 aMohapatra, Shyam0 tJournal of environmental science and health.g2016 Dec. 1, v. 51, no. 12 p.868-872dTaylor & Francisx1532-41097nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/03601234.2016.12119123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03603naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100005700153245016600210520173400376592002802110650001802138650001202156650001102168650001302179650001102192650001102203650000902214650002402223650001402247650001402261650001402275650001502289650002402304650001102328650001702339650001502356650001402371650001202385650000902397650000902406651001202415653001402427653001702441653002402458653001102482653001002493653001902503700006002522700001602582700001902598700002502617700001702642700002202659700006002681700002002741773011902761856008802880852000902968655001202977IND60678309720221122062553.0200503e20200410xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067830972DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.1355342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHofman, Jelle1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3450-653110aImpact of urban street canyon architecture on local atmospheric pollutant levels and magneto-chemical PM10 composition: An experimental study in Antwerp, Belgium  aAs real-life experimental data on natural ventilation of atmospheric pollution levels in urban street canyons is still scarce and has proven to be complex, this study, experimentally evaluated the impact of an urban street canyon opening on local atmospheric pollution levels, during a 2-week field campaign in a typical urban street canyon in Antwerp, Belgium. Besides following up on atmospheric particulate matter (PM), ultrafine particles (UFPs) and black carbon (BC) levels, the magneto-chemical PM₁₀ composition was quantified to identify contributions of specific elements in enclosed versus open street canyon sections. Results indicated no higher overall PM, UFP and BC concentrations at the enclosed site compared to the open site, but significant day-to-day variability between both monitoring locations, depending on the experienced wind conditions. On days with oblique wind regimes (4 out of 14), natural ventilation was observed at the open location while higher element contributions of Ca, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn and Sr were exhibited at the enclosed location. Magnetic properties correlated with the PM₁₀ filter loading, and elemental content of Fe, Cr, Mn and Ti. Magnetic bivariate ratios identified finel-grained magnetite carriers with grain sizes below 0.1 μm, indicating similar magnetic source contributions at both monitoring locations. Our holistic approach, combining atmospheric monitoring with magneto-chemical PM characterization has shown the complex impact of real-life wind flow regimes, different source contributions and local traffic dynamics on the resulting pollutant concentrations and contribute to a better understanding on the urban ventilation processes of atmospheric pollution.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair pollution 3acalcium 3acarbon 3achromium 3acobalt 3acopper 3airon 3amagnetic properties 3amagnetism 3amagnetite 3amanganese 3amonitoring 3anatural ventilation 3anickel 3aparticulates 3apollutants 3astrontium 3atraffic 3awind 3azinc 3aBelgium 0aPollution 0aArchitecture 0aNatural ventilation 0aMetals 0aUrban 0aPM composition1 aCastanheiro, Ana1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6563-83101 aNuyts, Gert1 aJoosen, Steven1 aSpassov, S.q(Simo),1 aBlust, Ronny1 aDe Wael, Karolien1 aLenaerts, Silvia1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4314-96761 aSamson, Roeland0 tScience of the total environment.g2020 Apr. 10, v. 712 p.135534-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.1355343Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02259naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100001600142245011600158300001600274520093800290592002801228650002101256650004401277650003701321650001501358650001301373650002901386650001401415650001901429650003301448650002101481650000901502653001801511653001501529653001901544653002501563653000901588700001601597700001301613700001601626773008601642856007601728852000901804655001201813IND60481607820221119091438.0160208e20121117xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6048160782DNAL7 a10.1515/hf-2012-00772doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYu, Haipeng10aAntimicrobial surfaces of quaternized poly[(2-dimethyl amino)ethyl methacrylate] grafted on wood via ARGET ATRP  ap. 455-461.  aIn special applications, such as hospitals and rehabilitation centers, hygienic wood surface with antimicrobial performance is recommendable. In the present study, the antimicrobial property of wood was increased by grafting with 2-(dimethylamino)ethyl methacrylate (DMAEMA). The reaction proceeds via radical polymerization, and analysis via Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, and thermogravimetric analysis confirmed the successful grafting of DMAEMA to wood. The tertiary amino groups of the immobilized P(DMAEMA) were then quaternized by an alkyl halide, and the quaternary ammonium groups at the surface in high concentration proved to be antibacterial. The test against Escherichia coli by means of the optical density method revealed that the bactericidal effect of the modified surface is higher than that of wood and the monomeric precursors of grafting.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3aabsorbance 3aammonium 3aantibacterial properties 3ahospitals 3apolymerization 3ascanning electron microscopy 3athermogravimetry 3awood 0aantibacterial 0aARGET-ATRP 0aquaternization 0asurface modification 0awood1 aFu, Yanchun1 aLi, Gang1 aLiu, Yixing0 tHolzforschung.g2012 Nov. 17, v. 67, no. 4 p.455-461dDe Gruyterx1437-434X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1515/hf-2012-00773Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02724naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002000139245025700159300001800416520146200434592002801896650001501924650001301939650002301952650002001975650001801995650004402013650002202057700001702079700002002096700003102116700002402147773011902171856007502290852000902365655001202374IND60549892820180208000000.0160909e20120803xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054989282DNAL7 a10.1021/jo300758g2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStrzalko, Tekla10aStudy of the Lithiated Phenylacetonitrile Monoanions and Dianions Formed According to the Lithiated Base Used (LHMDS, LDA, or n-BuLi). 2.

Dialkylation of the three dilithio dianions generated with n-BuLi (2.0–2.7 equiv, THF–hexane) depends on their structure: N-lithio (PhCCNLi)⁻Li⁺ and (C,N)-dilithio PhCLiCNLi dianions afford PhCR₂CN (R = PhCH₂, CH₃) from the intermediate N-lithio monoalkylated monoanion PhCRCNLi 10; C-lithio dianion (PhCLiCN)⁻Li⁺ leads to a carbenoid species, the C-lithio monoalkylated nitrile PhCLiRCN 11, which either eliminates carbene Ph–C̈–R and different LiCN species or isomerizes to PhCRCNLi in the presence of LiX (X = Cl, I). Dialkylation or dideuteriation of monoanions (monomers, dimers, and heterodimers [PhCHCNLi·LiR′], R′ = (SiMe₃)₂N, (i-Pr)₂N) obtained with LHMDS or LDA (2.4 equiv, THF) proceeds via a sequential mechanism involving monometalation-monoalkylation (or monodeuteriation) reactions. Some carbene and (LiCNLi)⁺ are also observed, and explained by another mechanism implying the C-lithio monoalkylated monoanion PhCLiRCN 9 in the presence of LiX. These results show the ambiphilic behavior of PhCLiRCN as a carbenoid (11) or a carbanion (9) and the importance of LiX formed in situ in the first alkylation step.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalkylation 3acarbenes 3achemical structure 3adeuterium oxide 3amethyl iodide 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aorganic chemistry1 aWartski, Lya1 aCorset, Jacques1 aCastellà-Ventura, Martine1 aFroment, Françoise0 tJournal of organic chemistry.g2012 Aug. 03, v. 77, no. 15 p.6431-6442dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-69047nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fjo300758g3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02752naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001500155245009900170300001600269520141800285592002801703650001601731650002601747650001901773650000901792650002101801650001801822650001501840650001201855650002001867650001301887651001901900653001301919653001501932653001501947653001801962700001501980700001801995700002502013700002502038700001502063773011702078856009002195852000902285655001202294IND60534560820221119155334.0190405e201408  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053456082DNAL7 a10.1016/j.smallrumres.2014.05.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTorres, A.10aEffects of oxytocin treatments on milk ejection in dairy goats traditionally milked once a day  ap. 231-233.  aGoats in Canary Islands are milked once a day, so they are adapted to accommodate large volumes of milk into their cisterns between milkings. Therefore it is important to know whether the oxytocin release by the stimulation of the mammary gland can increase the milk production when the goats are not milked immediately after the stimulation. Thirty-nine dairy goats in mid lactation (95±10 d in milk) were divided into 3 groups (n=13) on the basis of similar milk yields. During a period of 8-week, the goats from group 1 (OT1) were introduced to the milking parlor once a week, 10h after milking, and all pre-milking routines were carried out, including 2 to 3 stripping squirts of milk from each teat. However, the animals were not milked. During this period, the goats from group 2 (OT2) were injected intravenously with 2IU of oxytocin once a week, 10h after morning milking, while being placed in the crowd pen. However, the animals were not milked. The goats from group 3 (control) remained in the pen without any treatment. Milk recording and sampling were done the next day at the morning milking. Milk yield and milk composition in treatments OT1 and OT2 and control did not differ. The results suggest that oxytocin release by milking procedures or by administration of synthetically manufactured oxytocin did not reduce the content of milk in alveoli in dairy goats, which are not milked immediately.  aPublisher supplied data 3adairy goats 3aintravenous injection 3amammary glands 3amilk 3amilk composition 3amilk ejection 3amilk yield 3amilking 3amilking parlors 3aoxytocin 3aCanary Islands 0aOxytocin 0aDairy goat 0aMilk yield 0aMilk ejection1 aCapote, J.1 aArgüello, A.1 aSánchez-Macías, D.1 aMorales-delaNuez, A.1 aCastro, N.0 tSmall ruminant research.g2014 Aug., v. 120, no. 2-3 p.231-233dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl44843x0921-44887nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.smallrumres.2014.05.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03677naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245018500171300001600356520205100372592002802423650002202451650002002473650002302493650001402516650002302530650002002553650001302573650001502586650001302601650002702614650002402641650001602665650002102681653002302702653001802725653002202743653001302765653002202778653002302800700002102823700002002844700002502864700001902889700001902908700001602927773012202943856008503065852000903150655001203159IND60558873120221121005712.0161118e20161201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055887312DNAL7 a10.1080/03601234.2016.12119172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMajumder, Sujan10aEco-friendly PEG-based controlled release nano-formulations of Mancozeb: Synthesis and bioefficacy evaluation against phytopathogenic fungi Alternaria solani and Sclerotium rolfsii  ap. 873-880.  aControlled release (CR) nano-formulations of Mancozeb (manganese-zinc double salt of N,N -bisdithiocarbamic acid), a protective fungicide, have been prepared using laboratory-synthesized poly(ethylene glycols) (PEGs)-based functionalized amphiphilic copolymers without using any surfactants or external additives. The release kinetics of the developed Mancozeb CR formulations were studied and compared with that of commercially available 42% suspension concentrate and 75% wettable powder. Maximum amount of Mancozeb was released on 42nd day for PEG-600 and octyl chain, PEG-1000 and octyl chain, and PEG-600 and hexadecyl chain, on 35th day for PEG-1000 and hexadecyl chain, on 28th day for PEG-1500 and octyl chain, PEG-2000 and octyl chain, PEG-1500 and hexadecyl chain, and PEG-2000 and hexadecyl chain in comparison to both commercial formulations (15th day). The diffusion exponent (n value) of Mancozeb in water ranged from 0.42 to 0.62 in tested formulations. The half-release (t ₁/₂) values ranged from 17.35 to 35.14 days, and the period of optimum availability of Mancozeb ranged from 18.54 to 35.42 days. Further, the in vitro bioefficacy evaluation of developed formulations was done against plant pathogenic fungi Alternaria solani and Sclerotium rolfsii by poison food technique. Effective dose for 50% inhibition in mgL ⁻¹ (ED ₅₀) values of developed formulations varied from 1.31 to 2.79 mg L ⁻¹ for A. solani , and 1.60 to 3.14 mg L ⁻¹ for S. rolfsii . The present methodology is simple, economical, and eco-friendly for the development of environment-friendly CR formulations of Mancozeb. These formulations can be used to optimize the release of Mancozeb to achieve disease control for the desired period depending upon the matrix of the polymer used. Importantly, the maximum amount of active ingredient remains available for a reasonable period after application. In addition, the developed CR formulations were found to be suitable for fungicidal applications, allowing use of Mancozeb in lower doses.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAlternaria solani 3aAthelia rolfsii 3aactive ingredients 3aadditives 3acomposite polymers 3adisease control 3aethylene 3afungicides 3amancozeb 3aplant pathogenic fungi 3apolyethylene glycol 3asurfactants 3awettable powders 0aControlled release 0aencapsulation 0anano-formulations 0aMancozeb 0aAlternaria solani 0aSclerotium rolfsii1 aShakil, Najam A.1 aKumar, Jitendra1 aBanerjee, Tirthankar1 aSinha, Parimal1 aSingh, Braj B.1 aGarg, Parul0 tJournal of environmental science and health.g2016 Dec. 1, v. 51, no. 12 p.873-880dTaylor & Francisx1532-41097nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/03601234.2016.12119173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02646naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001900139245009400158520123000252592002801482650004101510650001501551650001101566650001501577650001601592650001501608651001801623700003701641700003301678700002601711700003001737700003301767700002701800700002701827700003401854700002601888700003901914700003001953700002701983773011902010856007402129852000902203655001202212IND60766981220221119071919.0220211e20220207xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076698122DNAL7 a10.3390/w140304882doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFujita, Thais 10aSimulating Discharge in a Non-Dammed River of Southeastern South America Using SWAT Model  aWithin a single region, it is possible to identify opposite changes in flow production. This proved to be the case for several basins in southeastern South America. It remains challenging to the causes this behavior and whether changes in streamflow will continue at current levels or decline in the coming decades. In this study, we used the Soil Water Assessment Tool to simulate monthly river discharge in the Ivaí River Basin, an unregulated medium-sized catchment and tributary of the Upper Paraná River Basin. After calibration, the simulated flow regime for the five streamflow stations based on the Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency index (NSE) rated four of the streamflow stations Very Good (NSE between 0.86 and 0.89) and only one in the Good index (0.70). The overall flow behavior was well represented, although an underestimation was identified in four monitoring stations. Through assessment of its functionality and limitations in terms of specific flow duration curves percentages, the calibrated model could provide (to managers) the reliability needed for a realistic intervention. The results of this study may assist managers and support public policies for the use of water resources at the Ivaí River basin.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSoil and Water Assessment Tool model 3ariver flow 3arivers 3asoil water 3astream flow 3awatersheds 3aSouth America1 ade Morais, Marcos Vinicius Bueno1 aDos Santos, Vanessa Cristina1 aRudke, Anderson Paulo1 ade Eiras, Marilia Moreira1 aXavier, Ana Carolina Freitas1 aAbou Rafee, Sameh Adib1 aSantos, Eliane Barbosa1 aMartins, Leila Droprinchinski1 aUvo, Cintia Bertacchi1 ade Souza, Rodrigo Augusto Ferreira1 ade Freitas, Edmilson Dias1 aMartins, Jorge Alberto0 tWater.g2022 Feb. 07, v. 14, no. 3dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21688x2073-44417nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w140304883Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02866naa a2200397 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002400075024005100099040001800150100001900168245015000187300001600337500001900353500000900372520160700381592002801988650002102016650001402037650001302051650002402064650000902088650001202097650000902109650002102118650002002139650001402159650001002173651001002183700001902193700001702212773012002229852000902349856009802358655001202456991622188000742620221118011249.0191122e197805  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aCAIN7891102682DNAL7 a10.2135/cropsci1978.0011183X001800030013x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKetring, D.

Because ethylene is an important regulator of peanut seed germination, we attempted to correlate its production with differences in early seedling growth. We found three growth distributions and ethylene production patterns. 1) When the majority of the seeds in the population had a high degree of vigor (78±8% of the seedlings had a hypocotyl-radicle length >20 mm at 70 hours of germination), they also had a characteristic ethylene production maximum at 21 hours of germination. 2) When the majority of the seeds in the population had a low degree of vigor (only 30% of the seedlings had a hypocotyl-radicle length >20 ram), ethylene production was reduced at 21 hours and the maximum occurred at 45 hours of germination. 3) When a majority of the seeds were in intermediate growth between 1) and 2), ethylene production was reduced by about 50% at 21 hours for the high ethylene-producing cultivars ‘Starr’ and ‘Tamnut 74’, but was not significantly changed for ‘Florunner’, a comparatively low ethylene-producing cultivar. Reduced seedling vigor was significantly correlated with decreased ethylene production at 21 hours for Start and Tamnut 74, but not for Florunner. Both seedling growth and ethylene production were altered by growing season and location. The majority of the seeds in the population, however, showed vigorous growth when the ethylene production rates exceeded a critical minimum level.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArachis hypogaea 3acultivars 3aethylene 3aethylene production 3aoils 3apeanuts 3arams 3aseed germination 3aseedling growth 3aseedlings 3avigor 3aTexas1 aSimpson, C.

However, the commonly used Cas9 nuclease derived from Streptococcus pyogenes (SpCas9) is not applicable to many industrially relevant bacteria, due to its cytotoxicity and large size (1368 amino acids [aa]). We developed an alternative genome editing system using a miniature Cas12f1 nuclease (529 aa) derived from an uncultured archaeon, Un1Cas12f1. When editing four dispensable genes in Escherichia coli MG1655 and BW25113, the CRISPR/Un1Cas12f1 system showed higher efficiency (63%–100%) than the CRISPR/SpCas9 system (50%–79%). The CRISPR/Un1Cas12f1 genome editing system is expected to be applied to the genome editing of a wide variety of bacteria.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3aStreptococcus pyogenes 3acytotoxicity 3aenzymes 0aCas12f1 nuclease 0aCRISPR 0aGenome editing 0aProtospacer-adjacent motif 0asgRNA1 aSatō, Yū,1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4538-43031 aHizume, Tatsuya1 aHonda, Kohsuke1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9069-75740 tJournal of bioscience and bioengineering.g2021 Aug., v. 132, no. 2 p.120-124dElsevier B.V.aThe Society for Biotechnology, JapanwJournal:jnl3929975x1389-17237nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jbiosc.2021.04.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02730naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100001300142245010900155300001600264520106100280592002801341650003701369650001401406650001501420650001901435650002201454650003101476650002101507650002201528650002001550650000701570650001101577650002001588650001901608650001401627650003701641650000901678650001401687650001901701653001001720653004001730653002501770653002401795653002201819653002401841653003301865653004301898700001801941700001701959700001701976773008601993856007602079852000902155655001202164IND60481608220221119091403.0160208e20121117xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6048160822DNAL7 a10.1515/hf-2012-01082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Rong14aThe adsorption and dispersing mechanisms of sodium lignosulfonate on Al2O3 particles in aqueous solution  ap. 387-394.  aThe adsorption behavior and dispersion efficiency of sodium lignosulfonate (NaLS) on Al₂O₃ particles at different pH values were investigated by UV-Vis spectroscopy, zeta potential measurement, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and viscosity measurements. The effects of the additives urea, Na₂SO₄, and NaCl were tested. At low pH values, NaLS adsorbed on the Al₂O₃ particles in the form of aggregates and at high pH values as separated single molecules. At pH 3–11, the adsorption was not affected through addition of urea, ruling out hydrogen bond as a controlling factor. By adding Na₂SO₄ and NaCl, the main driving force was the synergistic effect of the electrostatic interaction and the metal cation-π interaction at pH<pHIEP (IEP, isoelectric point), whereas the metal cation-π interaction was dominant at pH>pHIEP. The dispersing mechanism was mainly attributed to the steric hindrance (at pH<pHIEP) and the electrostatic repulsive force (at pH>pHIEP) owing to the differences in the aggregation state of the adsorbed molecules.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3aadditives 3aadsorption 3aaluminum oxide 3aaqueous solutions 3aelectrostatic interactions 3ahydrogen bonding 3aisoelectric point 3alignosulfonates 3apH 3asodium 3asodium chloride 3asodium sulfate 3asynergism 3aultraviolet-visible spectroscopy 3aurea 3aviscosity 3azeta potential 0aAl2O3 0aconfiguration of adsorbed molecules 0adispersing mechanism 0aFreundlich equation 0aLangmuir equation 0alignosulfonate (LS) 0asodium lignosulfonate (NaLS) 0aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS)1 aYang, Dongjie1 aGuo, Wenyuan1 aQiu, Xueqing0 tHolzforschung.g2012 Nov. 17, v. 67, no. 4 p.387-394dDe Gruyterx1437-434X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1515/hf-2012-01083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03141naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245016200169520141000331592002801741650002301769650001301792650001201805650001901817650001201836650002301848650001901871650002001890650002601910650001701936650002701953650001301980650002501993650002302018650002902041650001902070650001802089650001302107650001302120650001402133650001102147653002902158653002702187653002402214653002902238700001602267700001502283700001402298700001602312700002302328773012902351856008602480852000902566655001202575IND60747996120221121093944.0211129e20220115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074799612DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhazmat.2021.1269162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWu, Chengyang10aCo-removal of 2,4-dichlorophenol and nitrate using a palladized biofilm: Denitrification-promoted microbial mineralization following catalytic dechlorination  aThe effects of nitrate on 2,4-dichlorophenol (2,4-DCP) dechlorination and biodegradation in a hydrogen (H₂)-based palladized membrane biofilm reactor (Pd-MBfR) were studied. The Pd-MBfR was created by synthesizing palladium nanoparticle (Pd⁰NPs) that spontaneously associated with the biofilm to form a Pd⁰-biofilm. Without input of nitrate, the Pd-MBfR had rapid and stable catalytic hydrodechlorination: 93% of the 100-μM influent 2,4-DCP was continuously converted to phenol, part of which was then fermented via acetogenesis and methanogenesis. Introduction of nitrate enabled phenol mineralization via denitrification with only a minor decrease in catalytic hydrodechlorination. Phenol-degrading bacteria capable of nitrate respiration were enriched in the Pd⁰-biofilm, which was dominated by the heterotrophic genera Thauera and Azospira. Because the heterotrophic denitrifiers had greater yields than autotrophic denitrifiers, phenol was a more favorable electron donor than H₂ for denitrification. This feature facilitated phenol mineralization and ameliorated denitrification inhibition of catalytic dechlorination through competition for H₂. Increased nitrite loading eventually led to deterioration of the dechlorination flux and selectivity toward phenol. This study documents simultaneous removal of 2,4-DCP and nitrate in the Pd-MBfR and interactions between the two reductions.  aPublisher supplied data 3a2,4-dichlorophenol 3aAzospira 3aThauera 3abiodegradation 3abiofilm 3acatalytic activity 3adechlorination 3adenitrification 3adenitrifying bacteria 3afermentation 3aheterotrophic bacteria 3ahydrogen 3amembrane bioreactors 3amethane production 3amicrobial bioremediation 3amineralization 3ananoparticles 3anitrates 3anitrites 3apalladium 3aphenol 0aMembrane biofilm reactor 0aPalladium nanoparticle 0aHydrodechlorination 0aMicrobial mineralization1 aZhou, Luman1 aZhou, Chen1 aZhou, Yun1 aXia, Siqing1 aRittmann, Bruce E.0 tJournal of hazardous materials.g2022 Jan. 15, v. 422 p.126916-dElsevier B.V.aElsevier B.V.wJournal:6200x0304-38947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2021.1269163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02136naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002200150245007800172300001800250520120500268592002801473650002301501650001201524650001701536650001601553650001501569650001301584650001101597650001301608650001601621773008001637856008401717852000901801655001201810IND60095358620221122032933.0141104e201108  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009535862DNAL7 a10.1016/j.energy.2011.06.0242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlhazmy, Majed M.10aMulti stage flash desalination plant with brine–feed mixing and cooling  ap. 5225-5232.  aImproving the performance of Multi Stage Flash (MSF) desalination plants is a major objective in the seawater desalination industry. Fresh water production rates from MSF plants depend on the evaporation range defined as the difference between the top brine temperature (TBT) and the bottom stage temperature. Lowering the temperature of the plant bottom stage elongates the evaporation range and increases the yield. A modified multi stage flash plant with brine mixing and cooling (MSF-MC) is presented in this paper. Part of the brine leaving the plant is mixed with fresh seawater feed then cooled to low temperature before it enters the bottom stage feed heater. This MSF-MC features several advantages such as expanded evaporation range at the conventional TBT levels, reduced feed pumping power, moderate levels of chemical treatment requirements and fixed fresh water production rates independent of seasonal seawater conditions. Operating with low feed mass fraction minimizes the cooling load and reduces the cooler size. An improvement in the yield by 1.18%–1.4% for every 1 °C reduction in the plant bottom temperature can be achieved with MSF-MC compared to conventional MSF systems.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemical treatment 3acooling 3adesalination 3aevaporation 3afreshwater 3aindustry 3amixing 3aseawater 3atemperature0 tEnergy.g2011 Aug., v. 36, no. 8 p.5225-5232dElsevier Ltdx0360-54427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2011.06.0243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02831naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002700150245017000177300001400347520141700361592002801778650001401806650001701820650001701837650002801854650001401882650002201896650001301918650001601931650001201947650001401959650002201973650001301995651001002008653001802018653001602036653001402052653001402066653002602080653002702106653001802133700003102151773008602182856008402268852000902352655001202361IND60122599820221120162029.0150325e20140102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012259982DNAL7 a10.1080/00087114.2014.8917002doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNair Ambarish, Cheviri10aCytological and karyological observations on two endemic giant pill-millipedes Arthrosphaera (Pocock 1895) (Diplopoda: Sphaerotheriida) of the Western Ghats of India  ap. 49-56.  aCytological features and karyomorphology of two endemic giant pill-millipedes (Arthrosphaera fumosa and A. magna) of the Western Ghats were studied based on the meiotic cell divisions using Giemsa staining technique. Different meiotic stages of spermatogonial cell divisions were compared and karyotypes were constructed from the metaphase stages. The diploid chromosome number, 2 n = 30, in A. fumosa as well as A. magna with XY sex determination system was seen. Most of the meiotic chromosome behaviors were similar between the millipede species. All meiotic chromosomes in A. fumosa belonged to acrocentric type, while in A. magna 27 were acrocentrics, two (3rd and 10th) were sub-metacentrics and one (5th) was metacentric. The relative lengths of autosomes in A. fumosa and A. magna were 21.9–109.3 and 38.8–90.6, respectively. The X chromosome was longer than the Y chromosome in both millipedes. The relative lengths of the X chromosomes of A. fumosa and A. magna were 130.1 and 103.6, while for the Y chromosome they were 113.6 and 92.6, respectively. Based on this study and earlier cytological and karyological studies on Arthrosphaera , the diploid chromosome number has been predicted to be higher than 30. Further assessment is needed of identified and unidentified species distributed in the Western Ghats of India and other geographic locations to follow the chromosomal evolutionary pattern.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDiplopoda 3aX chromosome 3aY chromosome 3aacrocentric chromosomes 3aautosomes 3achromosome number 3adiploidy 3akaryotyping 3ameiosis 3ametaphase 3asex determination 3astaining 3aIndia 0aArthrosphaera 0achromosomes 0aDiplopoda 0akaryotype 0agiant pill-millipedes 0aspermatogonial meiosis 0aWestern Ghats1 aRamaiah Sridhar, Kandikere0 tCaryologia.g2014 Jan. 2, v. 67, no. 1 p.49-56dTaylor & Francisx2165-53917nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00087114.2014.8917003Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02934naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002300139245010900162500001900271520177500290592002802065650002102093650002702114650001302141650001302154650000902167650001902176650002302195650001402218650001002232700002002242700001702262700002202279700001802301700002702319773012002346856007302466852000902539655001202548IND60719088220221119122722.0201126e20201113xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071908822DNAL7 a10.3390/w121131702doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMondal, Indrayudh 10aComparative Transport of Legionella and E. coli through Saturated Porous Media in a Two-Dimensional Tank  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThis study investigated bacterial transport in a two-dimensional (2-D) tank to evaluate the bacterial behavior of Legionella pneumophila as compared to Escherichia coli under saturated flow to simulate aquifer conditions. The experiments were performed in a 2-D tank packed with 3700 in³ (60,632 cm³) of commercially available bagged play sand under saturated conditions. The tank was disinfected by backwashing with 10% chlorine solution and subsequently neutralized by backwashing with tap water containing sodium thiosulphate (Na₂S₂O₃) to ensure no chlorine residual. Bacterial transport was measured using samples collected from ports located at vertical transport distances of 5, 15 and 25 inches (12.7, 38.1 and 63.5 cm, respectively) below the sand surface along two vertical sections in the tank. An influent concentration of 10⁵ CFU/mL was used for bacterial cells and the vertical fluid transport rate was 10.3 in/day (26.2 cm/day), controlled using a peristaltic pump at the bottom outlet. Legionella breakthroughs were recorded at 8, 22 and 35 h for the ports on the right side and 9, 24 and 36 h for the ports on the left side, at 5, 15 and 25 inch depths, respectively. At the same depths, E. coli breakthroughs were recorded at 5, 17 and 30 h for the ports on the right side and 7, 19 and 31 h for the ports on the left sides. The delay in Legionella transport compared to E. coli is homologous to Legionella’s pleomorphic nature. This study provides evidence of the mobility of both E. coli and Legionella in saturated aquifer conditions at a scale more representative of actual aquifer conditions. This study also provides a substantive basis for the premise that cell characteristics affect transport characteristics under those conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3aLegionella pneumophila 3aaquifers 3achlorine 3asand 3asaturated flow 3asodium thiosulfate 3atap water 3awater1 aAcosta, Jazlyn 1 aAlum, Absar 1 aMayer, Brooke  K.1 aDahlen, Paul 1 aAbbaszadegan, Morteza 0 tWater.g2020 Nov. 13, v. 12, no. 11dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21688x2073-44417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w121131703Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03050naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002500150245012300175300001600298520164900314592002801963650001501991650001102006650001502017650002602032650002502058650002602083650001802109650002502127650001302152650002102165650002202186650001102208650001502219650001602234653002402250653002202274653002302296653001802319653002102337700002402358773011602382856008502498852000902583655001202592IND60617982720221121095014.0200515e20181215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061798272DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foreco.2018.08.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZlonis, Katharine J.10aInvasive earthworm damage predicts occupancy of a threatened forest fern: Implications for conservation and management  ap. 291-298.  aAdequate detection and monitoring of threatened, endangered, and sensitive species presents a challenge to forest managers seeking to balance management activities with conservation and forest health. This is especially true for rare, cryptic plant species that are difficult to detect, like goblin fern (Botrychium mormo), which is small and does not emerge from the duff layer of the rich hardwood forests it inhabits every year, even when present. Imperfect detection of this species makes it difficult to monitor, because lack of plants detected at a specific site does not necessarily indicate that the species has been extirpated there. In this study, 80 historic locations of B. mormo were surveyed for occurrence over three consecutive years to assess probability of occupancy and environmental factors expected to impact occupancy, including earthworm damage and canopy closure, while accounting for detectability. We found that probability of occurrence is most strongly related to earthworm damage and were able to identify levels of earthworm damage at which the species is more likely to remain present or be extirpated. These results suggest that use of a simple metric for quantifying ecological impact of earthworm damage can be used during monitoring to assess the likelihood that B. mormo is still present. With this information, forest managers can prioritize sites for habitat preservation and better shape policy and management decisions to protect and enhance habitat for this species. In addition, our study demonstrates the utility of occupancy modeling for management and conservation of rare and elusive plant species.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBotrychium 3acanopy 3aearthworms 3aenvironmental factors 3aenvironmental impact 3aferns and fern allies 3aforest health 3ahabitat conservation 3ahabitats 3ahardwood forests 3aissues and policy 3amodels 3amonitoring 3aprobability 0aInvasive earthworms 0aNorthern hardwood 0aOccupancy modeling 0aDetectability 0aBotrychium mormo1 aHenderson, Bobby W.0 tForest ecology and management.g2018 Dec. 15, v. 430 p.291-298dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl9013x0378-11277nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foreco.2018.08.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03044naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002500151245013100176520156000307592002801867650002201895650003701917650000901954650001601963650001001979650001301989650002302002650001402025650001902039650001102058650002102069650001502090653002502105653002902130653001702159653002602176653002902202653002202231700002002253700002102273700002102294700001902315700001902334773011402353856008602467852000902553655001202562IND60747996320221121093943.0211129e20220115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074799632DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhazmat.2021.1269192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHossain, Sayed Mukit10aVisible light activation of photocatalysts formed from the heterojunction of sludge-generated TiO2 and g-CN towards NO removal  aThe feasibility of preparing TiO₂/g-CN heterojunction from Ti-incorporated dried dye wastewater sludge is explored in this study. Two reaction routes of composite formation were evaluated. In the initial approach, one-step calcination of dried sludge and melamine mixture @600 °C was carried out. Detailed morphological and chemical characterizations showed that the one-step calcination route did not create TiO₂/g-CN composites; instead, only N-doped anatase TiO₂ composites were formed. Moreover, due to the non-uniform composition of organic content in the dried sludge, it was not easy to control the N doping level by varying melamine content (0–100%) in the precursor mix. However, successful formation of anatase TiO₂ and g-CN was observed when a two-step calcination route was followed, i.e., via synthesis of anatase TiO₂ from dried sludge, and later development of heterojunction by calcining (@550 °C) the TiO₂ and melamine mixture. X-ray diffraction along with infrared and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy verified the effective heterojunction. In addition, maximum atmospheric NO removal under UV and visible light were observed for the prepared composite when the melamine content in the precursor mixture was 70%. After 1 h of UV and visible light irradiation, the best TiO₂/g-CN composite removed 25.71% and 13.50% of NO, respectively. Optical characterization suggested that the enhanced NO oxidation under UV/visible light was due to the bandgap narrowing and diminished photogenerated electron-hole recombination.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3adyes 3airradiation 3alight 3amelamine 3aoptical properties 3aoxidation 3aphotocatalysts 3asludge 3atitanium dioxide 3awastewater 0aPhotooxidation of NO 0aTiO2/g-CN heterojunction 0aN-doped TiO2 0aSludge-generated TiO2 0aVisible light activation 0aResource recovery1 aTijing, Leonard1 aSuzuki, Norihiro1 aFujishima, Akira1 aKim, Chong-ho,1 aShon, Ho Kyong0 tJournal of hazardous materials.g2022 Jan. 15, v. 422 p.126919-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6200x0304-38947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2021.1269193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02349naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100001700142245007700159300001600236520135000252592002801602650001101630650001301641650000901654650001101663650001301674650001601687650001901703650001701722700001701739700001701756773015201773856007701925852000902002655001202011IND60765170320221119084820.0220422e20161230xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076517032DNAL7 a10.17221/44/2016-rae2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJobbágy, J.14aThe effectiveness of heating of housing unit by renewable energy source  ap.

The average value of dendromass moisture was 17.71%. The inserted fireplace Nordica Focolare 70 with a nominal output of 9 kW was used as a heat source. For temperature measurement, a non-contact infrared thermometer GM 900 was used. The total heat loss transferred through walls of housing unit (heat loss through thermal bridges and ventilation losses) were calculated at the value of 176.26 W/K. Based on the results of samples moisture the net calorific value of one kilogram of burned fuel wood was determined (14.791 MJ kg). The amount of thermal energy which is necessary to supply by the heating system for the whole heating period was 14,199.18 kWh. The weight of raw fuel wood was 5,450.97 kg (at moisture of 30%), dried at 17.71% (4,636.87 kg). Price of raw fuel wood of acacia for the year under evaluation was 64.80 €/m<sup>3</sup> (the required amount of raw fuel wood for heating period was 10 m<sup>3</sup>). Total costs for the heating season was thus 648 €. The price of heat transmitted by the fireplace inset Nordica Focolare 70 inserted into heating system using fuel wood (white acacia) with 17.71% of absolute moisture was 0.045636 €/kWh.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAcacia 3afuelwood 3aheat 3aprices 3aresearch 3atemperature 3athermal energy 3athermometers1 aKrištof, K.1 aAndacký, M.0 tResearch in Agricultural Engineering.g, v. 62, no.

These materials exhibit a powerful germicide capability over a wide variety of regular bacteria and other microorganisms widely present in the environment that cause infections and serious illness. The iPP-TiO₂ nanocomposites show similar or improved structural characteristics than those of the pure iPP matrix and aspects as important as processability and final mechanical performance seem to be not affected because of the incorporation of these TiO₂ nanoparticles. Validation of time–temperature superposition of the molten polymers is observed within the temperature range analyzed. On the other hand, the α polymorph is the one primarily attained for these specimens. Crystallinity and most probable crystallite size are slightly dependent on TiO₂ content, both increasing as oxide composition is enlarged.  aPublisher supplied data 3abacteria 3acost effectiveness 3acrystal structure 3acrystallites 3amelting 3ananocomposites 3ananoparticles 3apolypropylenes 3atemperature 3atitanium dioxide1 aCerrada, María L.1 aFernández-García, Marta,1 aRessia, Jorge1 aVallés, Enrique M.0 tEuropean polymer journal.g2012 Mar., v. 48, no. 3 p.586-596dElsevier Ltdx0014-30577nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.eurpolymj.2011.12.0123Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle01924naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245007300169300001400242520064300256592002800899650001600927650002300943650002200966650001200988650001201000650001801012650001601030650001001046650002801056653001701084653002501101653003401126653001401160653001301174700001901187700002501206700002301231700002401254700002101278773008601299856008401385852000901469655001201478IND60122600020221118172337.0150325e20140102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012260002DNAL7 a10.1080/00087114.2014.8922772doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNoikotr, Kowit10aKaryotype analysis of two groupers, Epinephelus species (Serranidae)  ap. 63-65.  aThis is an initial report of a cytogenetic study in two economically important species of Epinephelus , namely E. bleekeri and E. coeruleopunctatus , using the G-banding technique.

This basic knowledge is highly important for other technologies, such as those used in hybridization programming.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEpinephelus 3achromosome banding 3achromosome number 3afemales 3agrouper 3ahybridization 3akaryotyping 3amales 3atelocentric chromosomes 0acytogenetics 0aEpinephelus bleekeri 0aEpinephelus coeruleopunctatus 0akaryotype 0aThailand1 aPinthong, Krit1 aTanomtong, Alongklod1 aSudmoon, Runglawan1 aChaveerach, Arunrat1 aTanee, Tawatchai0 tCaryologia.g2014 Jan. 2, v. 67, no. 1 p.63-65dTaylor & Francisx2165-53917nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00087114.2014.8922773Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02281naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245008000168300001800248520129900266592002801565650001601593650001201609650002001621650001901641650001601660650000901676650001901685650001601704700001601720700003401736773008001770856008401850852000901934655001201943IND60095358920221122053630.0141104e201108  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009535892DNAL7 a10.1016/j.energy.2011.06.0292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMartinez, A.,10aExperimental and analytical study on thermoelectric self cooling of devices  ap. 5250-5260.  aThis paper presents and studies the novel concept of thermoelectric self cooling, which can be introduced as the cooling and temperature control of a device using thermoelectric technology without electricity consumption. For this study, it is designed a device endowed with an internal heat source. Subsequently, a commonly used cooling system is attached to the device and the thermal performance is statistically assessed. Afterwards, it is developed and studied a thermoelectric self cooling system appropriate for the device. Experimental and analytical results show that the thermal resistance between the heat source and the environment reduced by 25–30% when the thermoelectric self cooling system is installed, and indicates the promising applicability of this technology to devices that generate large amounts of heat, such as electrical power converters, transformers and control systems. Likewise, it was statistically proved that the thermoelectric self cooling system leads to significant reductions in the temperature difference between the heat source and the environment, and, what is more, this reduction increases as the heat flow generated by the heat source increases, which makes evident the fact that thermoelectric self cooling systems work as temperature controllers.  aPublisher supplied data 3acontrollers 3acooling 3acooling systems 3aelectric power 3aelectricity 3aheat 3aheat tolerance 3atemperature1 aAstrain, D.1 aFernandez, Aurelio Rodriguez,0 tEnergy.g2011 Aug., v. 36, no. 8 p.5250-5260dElsevier Ltdx0360-54427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2011.06.0293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02992naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245012200168300001400290520154800304592002801852650001601880650001701896650001701913650002201930650001401952650002001966650001301986650001701999650001902016650002802035650002402063650001302087651001002100653001202110653003502122653001402157653002202171653002402193700001402217700001502231700001302246700001702259700001602276700001502292773008602307856008402393852000902477655001202486IND60122600120221118172357.0150325e20140102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012260012DNAL7 a10.1080/00087114.2014.8922782doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Wanming10aQTLs and epistasis for drought-tolerant physiological index in soybean (Glycine max L.) across different environments  ap. 72-78.  aThe additive and epistatic effects and their genotype × environment (GE) effects on percentage gain with physiological traits under different environments were analyzed in soybean. The genetic characters of physiological traits in soybean and characters of quantitative trait loci (QTL) detected in different environments are discussed. A backcross inbred line (BIL) population of soybean derived from the cross of strong drought tolerant wild soybean, “SNWS0048” as a recipient parent and drought-sensitive variety “Jinda73” as a donor parent was examined to identify the QTL and epistatic QTL and GE effects on drought-tolerant physiological traits in Shanxi, China, in 2008 and 2010. Six QTLs with additive (a) effects and/or additive × environment interaction (ae) effects and three pairs of QTLs with additive × epistatic main (aa) and/or epistasis × environment interaction (aae) effects were detected in different water environment over two years. Six QTLs with a effects and/or ae effects were mapped to linkage groups D2, G, M and N. Among them, there were two QTLs without ae effects, one with ae effects in all four environments, two QTLs with ae effects in two environments and one QTL with ae effects in only one environment. Among three pairs of QTLs, one pair was identified with aa effect and aae effect, one pair only exhibited aa effect, and one pair only had aae effect without aa effect. These indicated that different water environments could affect the expression of genes relevant to drought tolerant traits.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGlycine max 3aGlycine soja 3abackcrossing 3adrought tolerance 3aepistasis 3agene expression 3agenotype 3ainbred lines 3alinkage groups 3aquantitative trait loci 3aquantitative traits 3asoybeans 3aChina 0asoybean 0aquantitative trait loci (QTLs) 0aepistasis 0adrought tolerance 0aphysiological index1 aWang, Min1 aYue, Aiqin1 aWu, Jing1 aLi, Shanshan1 aLi, Guiquan1 aDu, Weijun0 tCaryologia.g2014 Jan. 2, v. 67, no. 1 p.72-78dTaylor & Francisx2165-53917nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00087114.2014.8922783Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03787naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002400150245010300174300001600277520231900293592002802612650001902640650002902659650001802688650001902706650001102725650001602736650002402752650002002776650001402796650001002810650001002820651001102830653004602841653002502887653003202912653003302944653001602977653002002993653001803013700001903031700002403050700002103074773011603095856008503211852000903296655001203305IND60617982920221121095014.0200515e20181215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061798292DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foreco.2018.08.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCotton-Gagnon, Anne10aSalvage logging during spruce budworm outbreaks increases defoliation of black spruce regeneration  ap. 421-430.  aAlthough advance regeneration abundance and vigor are critical factors determining future forest composition and productivity, very few studies have focused on how they are affected by spruce budworm (SBW) outbreaks even though they affect millions of hectares of boreal forest on a cyclical basis. Post-SBW salvage logging is often used to reduce economic losses but could interact with the outbreak to affect advance regeneration. This study aims to determine the impact of SBW outbreaks and post-outbreak salvage logging on the defoliation of advance regeneration in mixed coniferous stands of northeastern Canada. Specifically, we assessed the effect of regeneration height and species (balsam fir or black spruce), as well as canopy composition, on the defoliation of advance regeneration. We then evaluated the effect of salvage logging on defoliation sustained by advance regeneration and compared it to the one observed in stands only affected by the SBW. Regeneration height and species, canopy composition and salvage logging all significantly affected defoliation and showed multiple interactions. Taller balsam fir seedlings were three times as defoliated as smaller ones, whereas it was 2.3 times for black spruce. Balsam fir seedlings were 15% more defoliated than black spruce. Seedlings of both species located beneath a balsam fir canopy were also more defoliated (>50% defoliation) than seedlings found under black spruce trees (about 26% defoliation). Salvage logging in black spruce-dominated stands resulted in a ∼25% increase in defoliation of tall (2.5 m) black spruce regeneration when compared to non-harvested sites. We speculate that this could increase the fir component in spruce-dominated stands, leading to forests that are more susceptible to future SBW outbreaks. To protect spruce advance regeneration from increased defoliation, salvage harvesting of spruce-dominated stands may thus be delayed until the outbreak has subsided. Long-term studies are needed to determine whether a compositional change occurs or not, particularly in spruce-dominated stands. As a precautionary measure, changes in salvage logging practices may be implemented immediately to avoid potential problems such as decreased black spruce abundance and increased susceptibility to future SBW outbreaks.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAbies balsamea 3aChoristoneura fumiferana 3aPicea mariana 3aboreal forests 3acanopy 3adefoliation 3afinancial economics 3asalvage logging 3aseedlings 3atrees 3avigor 3aCanada 0aSpruce budworm (Choristoneura fumiferana) 0aAdvance regeneration 0aBalsam fir (Abies balsamea) 0aBlack spruce (Picea mariana) 0aDefoliation 0aSalvage logging 0aBoreal forest1 aSimard, Martin1 aDe Grandpré, Louis1 aKneeshaw, Daniel0 tForest ecology and management.g2018 Dec. 15, v. 430 p.421-430dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl9013x0378-11277nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foreco.2018.08.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01912naa a2200313 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100001900184245010400203300002000307506007600327520076500403592002801168506003701196650001301233650001201246650001101258650001501269700003401284773017601318856008301494852000901577655001201586IND4481641420221207110618.0120502e20111227xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND448164142DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.11156711082doi7 aPMC32485272pmcid7 a221842212pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Xiaoming,10aConstraints on continental crustal mass loss via chemical weathering using lithium and its isotopes  ap. 20873-20880.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aChemical weathering, as well as physical erosion, changes the composition and shapes the surface of the continental crust. However, the amount of continental material that has been lost over Earth’s history due to chemical weathering is poorly constrained. Using a mass balance model for lithium inputs and outputs from the continental crust, we find that the mass of continental crust that has been lost due to chemical weathering is at least 15% of the original mass of the juvenile continental crust, and may be as high as 60%, with a best estimate of approximately 45%. Our results suggest that chemical weathering and subsequent subduction of soluble elements have major impacts on both the mass and the compositional evolution of the continental crust.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aisotopes 3alithium 3amodels 3aweathering1 aRudnick, R.

While species with narrow habitat range and low dispersal ability often respond negatively to urban environments, many habitat generalist species with good dispersal ability reach high densities in city centers. This filtering effect of urban habitats can strongly influence predator-prey-mutualist interactions and may therefore affect the abundance of predatory and phytophagous species both directly and indirectly. Here, we assessed the effect of urbanization on aphids, predatory arthropods, and ants on field maple (Acer campestre) trees in and around the city of Budapest, Hungary. We used the percentage of impervious surfaces within a 500 m radius of each site as an index of the degree of urbanization. We found that the abundance of aphids increased with increasing level of urbanization. However, abundance of predatory arthropods and occurrence of poorly dispersing species within the predator community were negatively related to urbanization, and we identified these two independent factors as significant predictors of aphid abundances. The abundance of ants decreased with urbanization, and contrary to our expectations, did not affect the abundance pattern of aphids. Our results suggest that urbanization, by altering the abundance and composition of predator communities, can disrupt biological control of aphid populations, and thus may contribute to the aphid outbreaks on urban trees.  aPublisher supplied data  aK129311cNemzeti Kutatási Fejlesztési és Innovációs Hivatal  aNKFIH-1159-6/2019cEmberi Eroforrások Minisztériuma 3aAcer campestre 3aAphidoidea 3abiological control 3ahabitats 3aurbanization 3aHungary1 aSzigeti, Viktor1 aMezőfi, László1 aKondorosy, Előd1 aMarkó, Viktor0 tUrban ecosystems.g2021 June, v. 24, no. 3 p.571-586dSpringer USwJournal:jnl3870259x1083-81557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11252-020-01061-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02736naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002200150245013100172300001800303500001900321520143100340592002801771650002501799650001201824650001001836650001501846650001701861650001801878650002301896650001901919650001801938650002001956650003201976650002402008700002002032700006502052773012802117856008402245852000902329655001202338IND60723973420221122175338.0210119e20201209xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072397342DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.analchem.0c044122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCawley, Jennie L.10aDetection and Characterization of Vesicular Gangliosides Binding to Myelin-Associated Glycoprotein on Supported Lipid Bilayers  ap. 1185-1192.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aIn the nervous system, a myelin sheath that originates from oligodendrocytes or Schwann cells wraps around axons to facilitate electrical signal transduction. The interface between an axon and myelin is maintained by a number of biomolecular interactions. Among the interactions are those between GD1a and GT1b gangliosides on the axon and myelin-associated glycoprotein (MAG) on myelin. Interestingly, these interactions can also inhibit neuronal outgrowth. Ganglioside–MAG interactions are often studied in cellular or animal models where their relative concentrations are not easily controlled or in assays where the gangliosides and MAG are not presented as part of fluid lipid bilayers. Here, we present an approach to characterize MAG–ganglioside interactions in real time, where MAG, GD1a, and GT1b contents are controlled and they are in their in vivo orientation within fluid lipid bilayers. Using a quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation monitoring (QCM-D) biosensor functionalized with a supported lipid bilayer (SLB) and MAG, we detect vesicular GD1a and GT1b binding and determine the interaction kinetics as a function of vesicular ganglioside content. MAG-bound vesicles are deformed similarly, regardless of the ganglioside or its mole fraction. We further demonstrate how MAG–ganglioside interactions can be disrupted by antiganglioside antibodies that override MAG-based neuron growth inhibition.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanalytical chemistry 3aanimals 3aaxons 3abiosensors 3agangliosides 3aglycoproteins 3agrowth retardation 3alipid bilayers 3amyelin sheath 3aoligodendroglia 3aquartz crystal microbalance 3asignal transduction1 aJordan, Luke R.1 aWittenberg, Nathan J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9196-18670 tAnalytical chemistry.g2020 Dec. 09, v. 93, no. 2 p.1185-1192dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:jnl70375x1520-68827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.analchem.0c044123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03626naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245016100169520198700330592002802317650002202345650003002367650002702397650002402424650001602448650002902464650001202493650001402505650001702519650001802536650001102554650001902565650002902584650001302613650001202626650001402638700001702652700002402669700003402693700002502727700002602752700002102778700002502799700002102824700002602845700002402871773012302895856008103018852000903099655001203108IND60748675020221119172927.0210827e20210816xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074867502DNAL7 a10.3390/pathogens100810332doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKrzyżek, Paweł 10aAntibiofilm and Antimicrobial-Enhancing Activity of Chelidonium majus and Corydalis cheilanthifolia Extracts against Multidrug-Resistant Helicobacter pylori  aHelicobacter pylori is a Gram-negative bacterium that colonizes the stomach of about 60% of people worldwide. The search for new drugs with activity against H. pylori is now a hotspot in the effective and safe control of this bacterium. Therefore, the aim of this research was to determine the antibacterial activity of extracts from selected plants of the Papaveraceae family against planktonic and biofilm forms of the multidrug-resistant clinical strain of H. pylori using a broad spectrum of analytical in vitro methods. It was revealed that among the tested extracts, those obtained from Corydalis cheilanthifolia and Chelidonium majus were the most active, with minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of 64 µg/mL and 128 µg/mL, respectively. High concentrations of both extracts showed cytotoxicity against cell lines of human hepatic origin. Therefore, we attempted to lower their MICs through the use of a synergistic combination with synthetic antimicrobials as well as by applying cellulose as a drug carrier. Using checkerboard assays, we determined that both extracts presented synergistic interactions with amoxicillin (AMX) and 3-bromopyruvate (3-BP) (FICI = 0.5) and additive relationships with sertraline (SER) (FICI = 0.75). The antibiofilm activity of extracts and their combinations with AMX, 3-BP, or SER, was analyzed by two methods, i.e., the microcapillary overgrowth under flow conditions (the Bioflux system) and assessment of the viability of lawn biofilms after exposure to drugs released from bacterial cellulose (BC) carriers. Using both methods, we observed a several-fold decrease in the level of H. pylori biofilm, indicating the ability of the tested compounds to eradicate the microbial biofilm. The obtained results indicate that application of plant-derived extracts from the Papaveraceae family combined with synthetic antimicrobials, absorbed into organic BC carrier, may be considered a promising way of fighting biofilm-forming H. pylori.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChelidonium majus 3aCorydalis cheilanthifolia 3aGram-negative bacteria 3aHelicobacter pylori 3aamoxicillin 3aantibacterial properties 3abiofilm 3acellulose 3acytotoxicity 3adrug carriers 3ahumans 3alawns and turf 3amultiple drug resistance 3aplankton 3astomach 3aviability1 aJunka, Adam 1 aSłupski, Wojciech 1 aDołowacka-Jóźwiak, Arleta 1 aPłachno, Bartosz J.1 aSobiecka, Aleksandra 1 aMatkowski, Adam 1 aChodaczek, Grzegorz 1 aPłusa, Tadeusz 1 aGościniak, Grażyna 1 aZielińska, Sylwia 0 tPathogens.g2021 Aug. 16, v. 10, no. 8dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27146x2076-08177nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/pathogens100810333Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01650naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002900150245007900179300001400258520056800272592002800840650001200868650001500880650002200895650001500917651000900932653001500941653001300956653002200969653000900991653001701000700003101017700002601048700002301074773008601097856008401183852000901267655001201276IND60122600320221118172322.0150325e20140102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012260032DNAL7 a10.1080/00087114.2014.8923972doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aParishani, Mohammad Reza10aChromosome numbers of taxa of the genus Jurinea Cass.

Yet, this approach relies upon the length and spatial distribution of the precipitation input data series, which often are scarce, especially in arid and semiarid regions. In this work, we present a new approach for the estimation of extreme floods based on the continuous synthetic simulation method supported with inputs of (a) a regional study of extreme precipitation to improve the calibration of the weather generator (GWEX), and (b) non-systematic flood information (i.e., historical information and/or palaeoflood records) for the validation of the generated discharges with a fully distributed hydrological model (TETIS). The results showed that this complementary information of extremes allowed for a more accurate implementation of both the weather generator and the hydrological model. This, in turn, improved the flood quantile estimates, especially for those associated with return periods higher than 50 years but also for higher quantiles (up to approximately 500 years). Therefore, it has been proved that continuous synthetic simulation studies focused on the estimation of extreme floods should incorporate a generalized representation of regional extreme rainfall and/or non-systematic flood data, particularly in regions with scarce hydrometeorological records.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclimate models 3ahydrologic models 3ahydrometeorology 3arain 3awater1 aAranda, José  Ángel1 aBenito, G.q(Gerardo),1 aFrancés, Félix,0 tWater.g2020 Nov. 13, v. 12, no. 11dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21688x2073-44417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w121131743Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04159naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100002000142245008300162300001600245520246500261592002802726650001302754650001802767650001802785650001902803650001702822650002502839650002002864650002002884650001202904650001502916650001302931650001302944650000902957650000702966650001502973650001402988650003303002650001303035650001803048650002003066650002403086650002203110650001703132650002103149650002803170650001903198650002503217650001003242651001903252700002703271700002303298700002303321773012703344856007703471852000903548655001203557IND60765170920221119085013.0220615e20200921xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076517092DNAL7 a10.17221/44/2019-swr2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHoráková, Eva10aChanges in the soil’s biological and chemical properties due to the land use  ap. 228-236.  aIncreasing the soil productivity is challenged by the increasing biotic threat to plants and microorganisms, by the resistance to agrochemicals, and by the declining soil health. Soil management strategy is, therefore, aimed at erosion prevention and the minimisation of soil organic matter losses. A key factor in an agroecosystem is the appropriate biological stability. It is essential not only at present, but also for further sustainable agriculture. This study was based on the hypothesis that afforestation and conversion from arable land to permanent grassland improves the organic matter status and biological stability in the agroecosystem. The experiment was conducted from 2014 to 2018 in the Uhřice bio-corridor (Kroměříž region, the Czech Republic). Haplic Luvisol has been investigated for its basic biological and chemical properties after the arable land was converted to a natural vegetation system. The afforested segment (F), permanent grassland segment (G), and arable land segment (A) have been sampled in the upper soil horizon (0–0.30 m). Standard analytical methods were applied for the determination of the basic soil properties. A principal component analysis and factor analysis were used for interpreting the connection between the parameters of the soil organic carbon, the humic substances, the humic acids, and the fulvic acids, the agrochemical properties of the soil (the pH, the content of the nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium, etc.), and the soil biological properties (basal soil respiration (BSR), the ratios of the N/BSR, NG/BSR, etc.). After five years of investigation, the differences in the studied parameters were evident. The factor analysis and multivariate exploratory techniques showed that the soil properties were grouped based on the management into three different categories – F, G and A. The different land use directly influenced the quality and stability of the humic substances, basal soil respiration, and carbon and nitrogen utilisation. In comparison to the arable land, the forest and grassland were considered to have a higher accumulation potential of carbon and nitrogen. A negative correlation between the soil basal respiration (r = –0.95); total nitrogen (r = –0.93); total organic carbon (C<sub>ox</sub>) content (r = –0.82); and partial Ca (r = –0.82) was found. A positive correlation (r = 0.80) between the humic substances (C-HS) and soil reaction (pH) was determined.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLuvisols 3aafforestation 3aagrochemicals 3aagroecosystems 3aarable soils 3abiological corridors 3aerosion control 3afactor analysis 3aforests 3agrasslands 3aland use 3anitrogen 3aoxen 3apH 3aphosphorus 3apotassium 3aprincipal component analysis 3aresearch 3asoil horizons 3asoil management 3asoil organic carbon 3asoil productivity 3asoil quality 3asoil respiration 3asustainable agriculture 3atotal nitrogen 3atotal organic carbon 3awater 3aCzech Republic1 aPospíšilová, Lubica1 aVlček, Vitězslav1 aMenšík, Ladislav0 tSoil and Water Research.g, v. 15, no. 4 p.228-236dCzech Academy of Agricultural ScienceswJournal:21421x1801-53957nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.17221/44/2019-swr3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02541naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100005900147245007500206300001100281500001100292520132500303592002801628650002001656650002101676650001201697650001701709650001901726650001001745650001201755650001101767650002201778650002001800650001801820650001501838650000901853650002201862650002101884651001101905773011201916856008202028852000902110655001202119IND60602067020221119134042.0181218e201812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060206702DNAL7 a10.1186/s40066-018-0196-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNkrumah, Bright1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3501-518410aEdible backyards: climate change and urban food (in)security in Africa  ap. 45.  aReview  aBACKGROUND: Food insecurity is continuously seen as a major problem in Africa, and as a challenge confronting millions of Africa’s urban population. Although some city residents produce their own food and, therefore, are food secured, others continuously find it difficult to access arable land in order to keep animals or cultivate crops. Climate change, in addition, seems to worsen the food insecurity situation of the region’s urban population, especially in the face of drought and flooding waters. To this end, this study recommends that urban agriculture (UA) is well positioned to mitigate the adverse effect of climate change and improve food security. RESULTS: The study found that the current problem posed by climate change to Africa’s urban food security is expected to worsen. Many urban populations are at risk of becoming victims of climate change through severe food supply problems caused by floods, droughts and hailstorms that affect food production in the hinterlands. African urban population has a role to play in finding appropriate solution to sustain food security, especially through UA. CONCLUSION: The study concludes that African governments should endeavour to create the necessary conducive environment to encourage urban residents to engage in animal husbandry and food production.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadverse effects 3aanimal husbandry 3aanimals 3aarable soils 3aclimate change 3acrops 3adrought 3afloods 3afood availability 3afood production 3afood security 3ahinterland 3arisk 3aurban agriculture 3aurban population 3aAfrica0 tAgriculture & food security.g2018 Dec., v. 7, no. 1 p.45-45dBioMed CentralwJournal:2267x2048-70107nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s40066-018-0196-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03237naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100003700150245012800187300001600315520159400331592002801925650002101953650002801974650001102002650001202013650001602025650001302041650001202054650001502066650001002081650002002091650001002111650003102121650003102152650001802183650001102201650001902212650001202231651001102243653002102254653001502275653000802290653001302298653001202311700002902323700003102352700003202383700002902415700002002444700002602464773008802490856008402578852000902662655001202671IND60122600620221118172339.0150325e20140403xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012260062DNAL7 a10.1080/00087114.2014.9316292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGonçalves, Álvaro Luiz Martini10aFirst cytogenetic characterization of the giant Amazonian catfish Brachyplatystoma filamentosum (Siluriformes, Pimelodidae)  ap. 101-105.  aIn contrast to the enormous variability of Neotropical fish species, genetic information about many groups is not yet available. Chromosomal studies have greatly contributed to the characterization of several species, providing important data on these animals. We performed the first cytogenetic characterization of the Amazonian fish species Brachyplatystoma filamentosum (Pimelodidae), popularly known as “piraíba”. The results revealed a diploid number of 2 n = 56 composed of 24 metacentric, 12 submetacentric, and 10 acrocentric chromosomes in both females and males. After silver nitrate treatment (AgNORs) it was possible to visualize the nucleolus organizer region located in the terminal portion of the short arms of subtelocentric chromosome pair 22, presenting size polymorphism. Hybridization with 18S and 5S rDNA probes confirmed the number and location of 18S marks rDNA in pair 22 and differences in the size of signals among homologs. The 5S rDNA genes were localized near the centromere on the short arms of chromosome pair 19. Constitutive heterochromatin (C-bands) were localized predominantly in the terminal regions of the chromosomes, and also occurred in some interstitial and centromeric positions. The chromosomal genetic data obtained in this study contribute to the biological characterization of B. filamentosum , which has economic and ecological importance as the largest freshwater catfish occurring in many rivers of the Amazon and Tocantins-Araguaia basins in Brazil.

In this work, we are aiming to investigate the potential of the novel greenly synthesized TiO₂NPs as a nano-drug delivery system for the anticancer drug, doxorubicin (Dox). The cytotoxicity of the synthesized TiO₂NPs was tested on two cell lines; normal human skin fibroblasts (HSF) and breast adenocarcinoma cells (MCF-7). Then, Dox was loaded to both TiO₂NPs (Dox- TiO₂NPs) and liposomes (Dox-Lip). The loaded nanoparticles were characterized by TEM, FTIR, encapsulation efficiency, particle size and zeta potential measurement. Moreover, in vitro drug release was studied. Ehrlich tumor-bearing mice were used to study the anticancer activity of Dox- TiO₂NPs, Dox-Lip, and aqueous Dox solution. Tumor volume, survival rate, and histopathological alterations were compared in all groups. Dox was successfully loaded to both liposomes and TiO₂NPs with an encapsulation efficiency of 77% and 65%, respectively. The particle size of Dox-TiO₂NPs, and Dox-Lip was 14.53 nm, and 103 nm, respectively. The cumulative Dox released from TiO₂NPs and liposomes after 4 h was 18 and 46%, respectively. Dox-Lip and Dox-TiO₂NPs resulted in the highest degree of tumor growth inhibition with 100% and 83% of treated animals remained alive, respectively. The greenly synthesized TiO₂NPs were proved to be as effective as liposomes in enhancing the anticancer activity of Dox.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAloe vera 3aadenocarcinoma 3aantineoplastic activity 3abreasts 3acytotoxicity 3adoxorubicin 3aencapsulation 3afibroblasts 3agrowth retardation 3ahistopathology 3amodels 3aparticle size 3askin (animal) 3asurvival rate 3atitanium dioxide 3azeta potential 0aTitanium dioxide nanoparticles 0aGreen synthesis 0aLiposomes 0aDrug delivery1 aHanafy, Magda.S.1 aKelany, Nermeen.A.1 aElywa, Mohammed.A.0 tHeliyon.g2021 June, v. 7, no. 6 p.e07370-dElsevier LtdwJournal:23264x2405-84407nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2021.e073703Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02838naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245009400165300001600259520167600275592002801951650002201979650001302001650001502014650003002029650001502059650001202074650002302086650001902109650001502128650001602143651001002159700001702169700001802186700001702204700002102221773010802242856008102350852000902431655001202440IND60602067120221119133919.0180709e201808  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060206712DNAL7 a10.1007/s40333-018-0005-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Xianfeng10aPerformance of different drought indices for agriculture drought in the North China Plain  ap. 507-516.  aThe Palmer drought severity index (PDSI), standardized precipitation index (SPI), and standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index (SPEI) are used worldwide for drought assessment and monitoring. However, substantial differences exist in the performance for agricultural drought among these indices and among regions. Here, we performed statistical assessments to compare the strengths of different drought indices for agricultural drought in the North China Plain. Small differences were detected in the comparative performances of SPI and SPEI that were smaller at the long-term scale than those at the short-term scale. The correlation between SPI/SPEI and PDSI considerably increased from 1- to 12-month lags, and a slight decreasing trend was exhibited during 12- and 24-month lags, indicating a 12-month scale in the PDSI, whereas the SPI was strongly correlated with the SPEI at 1- to 24-month lags. Interestingly, the correlation between the trend of temperature and the mean absolute error and its correlation coefficient both suggested stronger relationships between SPI and the SPEI in areas of rapid climate warming. In addition, the yield–drought correlations tended to be higher for the SPI and SPEI than that for the PDSI at the station scale, whereas small differences were detected between the SPI and SPEI in the performance on agricultural systems. However, large differences in the influence of drought conditions on the yields of winter wheat and summer maize were evident among various indices during the crop-growing season. Our findings suggested that multi-indices in drought monitoring are needed in order to acquire robust conclusions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTriticum aestivum 3aZea mays 3aarid lands 3aatmospheric precipitation 3acrop yield 3adrought 3aevapotranspiration 3aglobal warming 3amonitoring 3atemperature 3aChina1 aZhu, Xiufang1 aPan, Yaozhong1 aBai, Jianjun1 aLi, Shuangshuang0 tJournal of Arid Land.g2018 Aug., v. 10, no. 4 p.507-516dScience PresswJournal:21602x1674-67677nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s40333-018-0005-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02662naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100001900142245016800161300001600329520146900345592002801814650002901842650001201871650002901883650001801912650001701930650001801947650001701965650001601982650002501998650002502023700001902048700001702067773013002084856007702214852000902291655001202300IND60765171020221119084759.0220422e20201130xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076517102DNAL7 a10.17221/44/2020-jfs2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRasheed, Fahad10aTrade-off between shoot and root dry weight along with a steady CO<sub>2</sub> assimilation rate ensures the survival of Eucalyptus camaldulensis under salt stress  ap. 452-460.  aSalt stress is a major challenge for reforestation in arid to semi-arid regions. Therefore the effect of salt stress was tested in 4-months-old saplings of Eucalyptus camaldulensis under controlled conditions. Individuals were subjected to three levels of salt stress (2, 8, 16 d·Sm<sup>–1</sup>) and several traits describing growth and dry weight production/allocation, as well as physiological attributes were measured. The results showed that salt stress had no impact on plant height or stem diameter. Number of leaves, number of branches, and leaf chlorophyll content decreased significantly under high salt stress treatment. Leaf dry weight decreased significantly, but root dry weight increased significantly from 6.22 to 8.24 g under high salt stress treatment. Total plant dry weight remained similar while the root/shoot ratio increased significantly under high salt stress treatment. The net CO<sub>2</sub> assimilation rate remained stable at ~ 10.1 mmol·m<sup>–2</sup>·s<sup>–1</sup> and stomatal conductance decreased significantly to 79 mmol·m<sup>–2</sup>·s<sup>–1</sup> under high salt stress. Consequently, water use efficiency increased significantly to 3.25 mmol·mol<sup>–1</sup> under high salt stress. Therefore we may conclude that the young Eucalyptus camaldulensis saplings can tolerate moderate salt stress by increasing dry weight allocation towards the root system and sustaining the CO<sub>2</sub> assimilation rate.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEucalyptus camaldulensis 3aforests 3aleaf chlorophyll content 3aleaf dry mass 3aplant height 3areforestation 3aroot systems 3asalt stress 3astomatal conductance 3awater use efficiency1 aBakhsh, Rasool1 aQadir, Ihsan0 tJournal of Forest Science.g, v. 66, no. 11 p.452-460dCzech Academy of Agricultural ScienceswJournal:21419x1212-48347nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.17221/44/2020-jfs3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03070naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245012800170520140300298592002801701650001501729650001301744650001601757650001601773650002601789650001501815650001801830650002801848650002701876650001401903650001701917650002501934650002001959650001901979653001501998653001802013653002202031653001302053653003702066653001002103700002302113700001702136700002002153700002002173700002502193700001902218700001902237700002902256700002202285773011402307856008602421852000902507655001202516IND60747997020221121094017.0211129e20220115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074799702DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhazmat.2021.1269262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYounas, Fazila10aConstructed wetlands as a sustainable technology for wastewater treatment with emphasis on chromium-rich tannery wastewater  aWater scarcity is a major threat to agriculture and humans due to over abstraction of groundwater, rapid urbanization and improper use in industrial processes. Industrial consumption of water is lower than the abstraction rate, which ultimately produces large amounts of wastewater such as from tannery industry containing high concentration of chromium (Cr). Chromium-contaminated tannery industry wastewater is used for irrigation of food crops, resulting in food safety and public health issues globally. In contrast to conventional treatment technologies, constructed wetlands (CWs) are considered as an eco-friendly technique to treat various types of wastewaters, although their application and potential have not been discussed and elaborated for Cr treatment of tannery wastewater. This review briefly describes Cr occurrence, distribution and speciation in aquatic ecosystems. The significance of wetland plant species, microorganisms, various bedding media and adsorbents have been discussed with a particular emphasis on the removal and detoxification of Cr in CWs. Also, the efficiency of various types of CWs is elaborated for advancing our understanding on Cr removal efficiency and Cr partitioning in various compartments of the CWs. The review covers important aspects to use CWs for treatment of Cr-rich tannery wastewater that are key to meet UN’s Sustainable Development Goals.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorbents 3achromium 3afood safety 3agroundwater 3aindustrial wastewater 3airrigation 3apublic health 3asustainable development 3asustainable technology 3atanneries 3aurbanization 3awastewater treatment 3awater shortages 3awetland plants 0aAdsorption 0aContamination 0aPhytoaccumulation 0aToxicity 0aUN-Sustainable Development Goals 0aWater1 aNiazi, Nabeel Khan1 aBibi, Irshad1 aAfzal, Muhammad1 aHussain, Khalid1 aShāhid, Muḥammad,1 aZubair, Aslam,1 aBashir, Safdar1 aHussain, Muhammad Mahroz1 aBundschuh, Jochen0 tJournal of hazardous materials.g2022 Jan. 15, v. 422 p.126926-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6200x0304-38947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2021.1269263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03050naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001200147245021500159520160800374592002801982650002302010650000802033650005202041650002502093650001302118650001602131650000902147650002602156650002402182650001102206650001102217650000902228650002602237650002302263650001902286650001102305700002302316700001902339700001902358700001402377773012302391856008102514852000902595655001202604IND60748675420221119173131.0210827e20210816xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074867542DNAL7 a10.3390/pathogens100810392doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDi, Da 10aRecombinant SARS-CoV-2 Nucleocapsid Protein: Expression, Purification, and Its Biochemical Characterization and Utility in Serological Assay Development to Assess Immunological Responses to SARS-CoV-2 Infection  aThe SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein (N) binds a single-stranded viral RNA genome to form a helical ribonucleoprotein complex that is packaged into virion particles. N is relatively conserved among coronaviruses and consists of the N-terminal domain (NTD) and C-terminal domain (CTD), which are flanked by three disorganized regions. N is highly immunogenic and has been widely used to develop a serological assay as a diagnostic tool for COVID-19 infection, although there is a concern that the natural propensity of N to associate with RNA might compromise the assay’s specificity. We expressed and purified from bacterial cells two recombinant forms of SARS-CoV-2 N, one from the soluble fraction of bacterial cell lysates that is strongly associated with bacterial RNAs and the other that is completely devoid of RNAs. We showed that both forms of N can be used to develop enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) for the specific detection of human and mouse anti-N monoclonal antibodies (mAb) as well as feline SARS-CoV-2 seropositive serum samples, but that the RNA-free form of N exhibits a slightly higher level of sensitivity than the RNA-bound form to react to anti-N mouse mAb. Using the electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA), we also showed that N preferentially binds ssRNA in a sequence-independent manner and that both NTD and CTD of N contribute to RNA-binding activity. Collectively, our study describes methods to express, purify, and biochemically characterize the SARS-CoV-2 N protein and to use it for the development of serological assays to detect SARS-CoV-2 infection.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCOVID-19 infection 3aRNA 3aSevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 3aamino acid sequences 3abacteria 3ablood serum 3acats 3adiagnostic techniques 3agel electrophoresis 3agenome 3ahumans 3amice 3anucleocapsid proteins 3aribonucleoproteins 3aseroprevalence 3avirion1 aDileepan, Mythili 1 aAhmed, Shamim 1 aLiang, Yuying 1 aLy, Hinh 0 tPathogens.g2021 Aug. 16, v. 10, no. 8dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27146x2076-08177nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/pathogens100810393Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03822naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245010000166300001600266520227900282592002802561650002502589650002402614650002202638650002902660650001502689650001502704650002002719650002102739650001202760650001502772650002402787650001302811650002202824650000902846650002502855650001202880650002502892650002102917651001202938700001802950700002002968700002002988700002203008700002003030700002303050700002103073773010803094856008103202852000903283655001203292IND60602067320221119134106.0180709e201808  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060206732DNAL7 a10.1007/s40333-018-0095-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBelala, Fahima10aRainfall patterns of Algerian steppes and the impacts on natural vegetation in the 20th century  ap. 561-573.  aSince 1960, the steppe regions of North Africa have been subject to an increasing desertification, including the degradation of traditional pastures. The initially dominant species (Artemisia herba-alba, Lygeum spartum and Stipa tenacissima) declined and were progressively replaced by other species (Atractylis serratuloides and Salsola vermiculata) that are more tolerant to the new conditions. It is not clear whether these changes are due to anthropogenic reasons or climatic determinism. We have carried out a statistical analysis of the climate to detect putative rainfall changes during the 20ᵗʰ century in the Algerian steppes based on data from 9 meteorological stations, including 2 Saharan stations (El Oued and Touggourt), 3 pre-Saharan stations (Biskra, Laghouat and Ain Sefra) and 4 steppe stations (Djelfa, Saida, Méchéria and El-Bayadh) located in the arid high plains, which represent the bioclimate diversities of the region. Previous studies suggested that significant rainfall changes for the 20ᵗʰ century only had records in the south of the Oran region. Most of the studies, however, looked at restricted territories over limited periods, and did not integrate the rainiest period 2004–2014. Our work is designed to integrate all the longest time series of meteorological data available for the steppe regions of Algeria. Our results confirm the spatial rainfall distribution (significant rainfall changes only recorded in the southwestern region) evidenced by previous studies, and reveal a decreasing rainfall gradient from northeastern to southwestern Algeria. Moreover, the results reveal a trend of significant decrease of rainfall in the southern Oran region, marked by two drought periods in 1980–1985 and 1999–2003. However, with the exception of the southwestern region, rainfall overall has not declined since the beginning of the 20ᵗʰ century. While less marked in other regions, the drought appear to have affected all territories of the Algerian steppe. Consequently, our study implies that the climate was not a leading influence in the on-going degradation of the vegetation cover of steppe landscapes. Such a vegetation evolution thus appears to be have been determined more by human activities than by climate forcing.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArtemisia herba-alba 3aSalsola vermiculata 3aStipa tenacissima 3aanthropogenic activities 3aarid lands 3abioclimate 3adesertification 3adominant species 3adrought 3alandscapes 3ameteorological data 3apastures 3aradiative forcing 3arain 3astatistical analysis 3asteppes 3atime series analysis 3avegetation cover 3aAlgeria1 aHirche, Azziz1 aMuller, Serge D1 aTourki, Mahmoud1 aSalamani, Mostefa1 aGrandi, Mohamed1 aAit Hamouda, Tahar1 aBoughani, Madjid0 tJournal of Arid Land.g2018 Aug., v. 10, no. 4 p.561-573dScience PresswJournal:21602x1674-67677nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s40333-018-0095-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02645naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002400149245011900173300001600292500001400308520117400322592002801496650001901524650002301543650002801566650002001594650001201614650001701626650001301643650002201656650001101678650001201689700005901701700001701760700002201777700002101799700006001820700006301880700006101943773011502004856008302119852000902202655001202211IND60723973920221118001339.0210119e20201219xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072397392DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.biochem.0c008562doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKaneshiro, April K.10aKinetic Analysis of Transient Intermediates in the Mechanism of Prenyl-Flavin-Dependent Ferulic Acid Decarboxylase  ap. 125-134.  aNAL-light  aFerulic acid decarboxylase catalyzes the decarboxylation of various substituted phenylacrylic acids to their corresponding styrene derivatives and CO₂ using the recently discovered cofactor prenylated FMN (prFMN). The mechanism involves an unusual 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition reaction between prFMN and the substrate to generate a cycloadduct capable of undergoing decarboxylation. Using native mass spectrometry, we show the enzyme forms a stable prFMN–styrene cycloadduct that accumulates on the enzyme during turnover. Pre-steady state kinetic analysis of the reaction using ultraviolet–visible stopped-flow spectroscopy reveals a complex pattern of kinetic behavior, best described by a half-of-sites model involving negative cooperativity between the two subunits of the dimeric enzyme. For the reactive site, the cycloadduct of prFMN with phenylacylic acid is formed with a kₐₚₚ of 131 s–¹. This intermediate converts to the prFMN–styrene cycloadduct with a kₐₚₚ of 75 s–¹. Cycloelimination of the prFMN–styrene cycloadduct to generate styrene and free enzyme appears to determine kcₐₜ for the overall reaction, which is 11.3 s–¹.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon dioxide 3acatalytic activity 3acycloaddition reactions 3adecarboxylation 3aenzymes 3aferulic acid 3akinetics 3amass spectrometry 3amodels 3astyrene1 aKoebke, Karl J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2198-26671 aZhao, Chunyi1 aFerguson, Kyle L.1 aBallou, David P.1 aPalfey, Bruce A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5098-259X1 aRuotolo, Brandon T.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6084-23281 aMarsh, E.

Decreased visibility affects time spent associating with conspecifics and strength of preference (SOP) in fish that use visual cues. Here, we test the hypothesis that fountain darter (Etheostoma fonticola; a federally endangered species) body size preferences are affected by reduced visibility. We tested offspring of wild-caught fish using a dichotomous choice design with clear and reduced visibility treatments. Males and females spent more time associating with fish of the opposite sex in the clear treatment than in the reduced visibility treatment. Smaller females spent more time associating with other females in the clear treatment, whereas larger females spent more time associating with other females in reduced visibility. Smaller females had a higher SOP for larger males in the clear treatment, whereas larger females had a higher SOP for larger males in the reduced visibility treatment. Increased levels of turbidity that leads to reduced visibility affect the use of visual cues in E. fonticola, resulting in a reduction in time spent in social interaction and affecting association preferences of this endangered species.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEtheostoma 3abody size 3aendangered species 3afemales 3afish 3amales 3aprogeny 3arivers 3asocial behavior 3aturbidity 3awater flow1 aDeColo, Sophia L.1 aGoff, Cory B.1 aGabor, Caitlin R.0 tHydrobiologia.g2019 July, v. 838, no. 1 p.45-54dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:jnl42390x0018-81587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-019-03975-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02590naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001500151245012200166520134700288592002801635650001501663650001501678650001201693650001401705650002301719650001501742650001801757650001901775650001701794650002201811653001501833700002001848700001701868700001801885700001401903700001401917700001501931700001301946773011401959856008602073852000902159655001202168IND60747997220221121093954.0211129e20220115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074799722DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhazmat.2021.1269282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJin, Zilan10aAdsorption and catalytic degradation of organic contaminants by biochar: Overlooked role of biochar’s particle size  aBiochar (BC) is considered as a promising adsorbent and/or catalyst for the removal of organic contaminants. However, the relationship between the particle size of BC and its adsorption/catalysis performance is largely unclear. We therefore investigated the influence of particle size on the performance of BC pyrolyzed at 300–900 °C in trichloroethylene (TCE) adsorption and persulfate (PS) activation for sulfamethazine (SMT) degradation. The results showed that high-temperature pyrolyzed BC (BC900) presented superior adsorption capacity for TCE and excellent catalytic activity for PS activation to degrade SMT. Compared to 150–250 µm, 75–150 µm and pristine BC900, 0–75 µm BC900 showed the highest TCE adsorption efficiency, which increased by 19.5–62.3%. Similarly, SMT removal by BC900/PS systems also increased from 24.2% to 98.3% with decreasing BC particle size. However, the catalytic activity of BC after grinding was not significantly improved as expected, indicating the properties of biochar was not only controlled by size effect. Characterization measurements proved that small-sized BC tended to have larger specific surface area, more micropores, higher conductivity, rich graphitic domains and surface redox-active functional groups, thus resulting in an enhanced adsorption and catalytic ability of BC.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorbents 3aadsorption 3abiochar 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3amicropores 3aparticle size 3asulfamethazine 3asurface area 3atrichloroethylene 0aPersulfate1 aXiao, Shuangjie1 aDong, Haoran1 aXiao, Junyang1 aTian, Ran1 aChen, Jie1 aLi, Yangju1 aLi, Long0 tJournal of hazardous materials.g2022 Jan. 15, v. 422 p.126928-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6200x0304-38947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2021.1269283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03155naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245009400170300001600264520181000280592002802090650001602118650001702134650002302151650002602174650001202200650001202212650001502224650001302239650001602252650002102268650002002289651001102309651001002320653001702330653002302347653001302370653001502383653001502398653002202413700002402435700001602459773011602475856008502591852000902676655001202685IND60617983620221120042209.0200515e20181215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061798362DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foreco.2018.08.0322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOhwaki, Atsushi10aEvaluating forest clear-cuts as alternative grassland habitats for plants and butterflies  ap. 337-345.  aTemperate semi-natural grasslands in Europe and East Asia have been rapidly declining and their conservation is urgently required. Although recent studies have indicated the importance of clear-cuts as alternative habitats for grassland butterflies, there is paucity of studies that directly compare biodiversity and habitat quality between grasslands and clear-cuts using multiple taxa. In this study, we compared the plant and butterfly richness between grasslands and clear-cuts, with a focus on the distribution of butterfly resources (nectaring flowers and host plants) and endangered plant and butterfly species, in a cool temperate area of central Japan. We established three or six transects in five grassland and five clear-cut sites, and measured the richness of plants and butterflies and environmental variables such as vegetation height and coverage at both transect and site levels. At the site level, there were no differences in the richness of all plants, butterflies, and butterfly host plants, but there were significant or marginal differences in the richness of endangered plants, butterflies, and butterfly host plants. Almost all endangered plants and butterflies were found in the overall grasslands, but only half of the endangered butterfly species were observed in the overall clear-cuts. At the transect level, species richness of endangered plants and butterflies peaked at an intermediate vegetation height. Our results indicate the primary importance of existing semi-natural grasslands and the necessity of management when the vegetation becomes too high. We recommend active creation of clear-cuts near or between the existing grasslands, so that clear-cuts can provide source or backup populations and act as stepping stones to connect the isolated grassland populations.  aPublisher supplied data 3abutterflies 3aclearcutting 3aendangered species 3aenvironmental factors 3aflowers 3aforests 3agrasslands 3ahabitats 3ahost plants 3aspecies richness 3atemperate zones 3aEurope 3aJapan 0aBiodiversity 0aEndangered species 0aForestry 0aManagement 0aPlantation 0aVegetation height1 aKoyanagi, Tomoyo F.1 aMaeda, Saki0 tForest ecology and management.g2018 Dec. 15, v. 430 p.337-345dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl9013x0378-11277nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foreco.2018.08.0323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02592naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001500139245010100154300001800255500002000273520125800293592002801551650002501579650002501604650001701629650002301646650003101669650002301700650001201723650003401735650001401769650004301783650001401826650001001840700005701850700001901907700005701926773011701983856007302100852000902173655001202182IND60612751020221119043640.0180907e201810  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061275102DNAL7 a10.1111/ppa.128812doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFousia, S.10aIncreased resistance to Verticillium dahliae in Arabidopsis plants defective in auxin signalling  ap. 1749-1757.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aAuxin signalling and transport participate in plant–microbe interactions as positive or negative regulators of disease resistance. The present study investigated the responses of Arabidopsis thaliana plants impaired in the auxin receptors TIR1, AFB1 and AFB3 and the auxin transporter AXR4, upon infection by the soilborne root pathogen Verticillium dahliae. Fewer symptoms were recorded in afb1, afb3 and axr4 plants compared to the wild type (wt). qPCR analysis revealed that the decrease in symptom severity in afb1, afb3 and axr4 was correlated with reduction in the growth of the pathogen in the plants. Therefore, afb1, afb3 and axr4 are partially resistant to V. dahliae. Upon V. dahliae infection, the expression of TIR1, AFB1, AFB3 and AXR4 was up‐regulated in roots, while indole‐3‐acetic acid levels were similar to mocks. The partial resistance of afb1, afb3 and axr4 against V. dahliae can be attributed in part to the up‐regulation of defence‐related genes, as it was observed that afb1 and axr4 had higher PR1 levels than wt, while afb3 had higher PDF1.2 levels than wt. The findings of the present study suggest that the auxin signalling defective mutants afb1, afb3 and axr4 show increased resistance against V. dahliae.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3aVerticillium dahliae 3aaflatoxin B1 3adisease resistance 3agene expression regulation 3aindole acetic acid 3amutants 3apathogenesis-related proteins 3apathogens 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3areceptors 3aroots1 aTsafouros, A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1041-18421 aRoussos, P.

This protein, involved in S. aureus-mediated pathogenesis, is typically blocked by RsbW, an antisigma factor having serine kinase activity. σᴮ, a σ⁷⁰-like sigma factor, harbors three conserved domains designated σᴮ², σᴮ³, and σᴮ⁴. To better understand the interaction between RsbW and σᴮ or its domains, we have studied their recombinant forms, rRsbW, rσᴮ, rσᴮ², rσᴮ³, and rσᴮ⁴, using different probes. The results show that none of the rσᴮ domains, unlike rσᴮ, showed binding to a cognate DNA in the presence of a core RNA polymerase. However, both rσᴮ² and rσᴮ³, like rσᴮ, interacted with rRsbW, and the order of their rRsbW binding affinity looks like rσᴮ > rσᴮ³ > rσᴮ². Furthermore, the reaction between rRsbW and rσᴮ or rσᴮ³ was exothermic and occurred spontaneously. rRsbW and rσᴮ³ also associate with each other at a stoichiometry of 2:1, and different types of noncovalent bonds might be responsible for their interaction. A structural model of the RsbW-σᴮ³ complex that has supported our experimental results indicated the binding of rσᴮ³ at the putative dimeric interface of RsbW. A genetic study shows that the tentative dimer-forming region of RsbW is crucial for preserving its rσᴮ binding ability, serine kinase activity, and dimerization ability. Additionally, a urea-induced equilibrium unfolding study indicated a notable thermodynamic stabilization of σᴮ³ in the presence of RsbW. Possible implications of the stabilization data in drug discovery were discussed at length.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aDNA-directed RNA polymerase 3aGram-positive bacteria 3aStaphylococcus aureus 3abinding capacity 3adimerization 3adrugs 3aexhibitions 3aheat production 3alength 3amodels 3apathogenesis 3aprotein-serine-threonine kinases 3asigma factors 3astoichiometry 3astress response1 aSinha, Debasmita1 aDutta, Anindya1 aChakraborty, Tushar1 aMondal, Rajkrishna1 aSeal, Soham1 aPoddar, Asim1 aChatterjee, Subhrangsu1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3250-73111 aSau, Subrata1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6197-09810 tBiochemistry.g2021 Jan. 06, v. 60, no. 2 p.135-151dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19162x1520-49957nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.biochem.0c008813Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02387naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002000152245014400172300001600316520122300332592002801555650001401583650001001597650001901607650001201626650001301638650002501651650001501676650003001691650001501721650001301736650002801749700002401777700001901801700001801820773009901838856005501937852000901992655001202001IND4478631320221120175324.0120727e201110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447863132DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1439-0523.2011.01871.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHoshino, Tomoki10aMolecular characterization and marker development of mid‐oleic‐acid mutant M23 for the development of high‐oleic cultivars of soybean  ap. 544-550.  aWith 6 figures and 2 tables ABSTRACT: The mid‐oleic‐acid soybean mutant M23 has been frequently used to develop lines with elevated oleic acid content. M23, which was produced by X‐ray irradiation, was previously shown to contain a large deletion including GmFAD2‐1a, one of the genes encoding microsomal omega‐6 fatty acid desaturase (GmFAD2). However, it was not possible then to develop a codominant marker for the selection of the M23 mutation because the extent of the deletion was unknown. Here, we report that PCR analysis of M23 using published soybean genome sequences as a reference revealed a 164 014‐bp deletion including GmFAD2‐1a and nineteen other predicted genes. We generated a codominant PCR‐based marker that can distinguish wild‐type/M23 heterozygotes from both homozygous classes. We genotyped F2 plants segregating for the M23 mutation and confirmed the association of genotype and phenotype. This information will be useful in developing new commercial cultivars of high‐oleic‐acid soybean. We discuss the possible functions of the genes in the deleted region of M23 in relation to reduced seed yield, which occurs frequently in soybean lines containing the M23 mutation.  aPublisher supplied data 3acultivars 3agenes 3aheterozygosity 3amutants 3amutation 3anucleotide sequences 3aoleic acid 3apolymerase chain reaction 3aseed yield 3asoybeans 3astearoyl-CoA desaturase1 aKawashita, Nobuhisa1 aTakagi, Yutaka1 aAnai, Toyoaki0 tPlant breeding.g2011 Oct., v. 130, no. 5 p.544-550dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0179-95417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1439-0523.2011.01871.x  aDNAL 7aarticle02888naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245012100164300001600285520149100301592002801792650001801820650001501838650001201853650001601865650003301881650002801914650001201942650001101954650001901965650001701984650002202001650001002023650001202033650002502045650002502070650003302095651001002128700001402138700001202152700001702164700001602181700001102197773010802208856008102316852000902397655001202406IND60602067620221119134207.0180709e201808  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060206762DNAL7 a10.1007/s40333-018-0011-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Xiaobing10aGrazing every month minimizes size but boosts photosynthesis in Stipa grandis in the steppe of Inner Mongolia, China  ap. 601-611.  aIn order to explore the effects of grazing frequency on functional traits and to test whether Stipa gandis has compensatory photosynthesis during the frequent grazing period, we investigated morphological traits, biomass allocation, photosynthetic traits, and chlorophyll fluorescence parameters of the species in Inner Mongolia, China. The grazing frequency treatments included fencing (T₀), grazing in May and July (T₁, i.e., two months per year) and grazing from May to September (T₂, i.e., continuous five months per year). Results indicate that T₁ and T₂ treatments did not affect individual biomass, but T₂ treatment negatively affected individual size, i.e., plant height, stem length, and leaf length. Physiological traits of S. grandis were significantly affected by grazing, year, and their interaction. In July 2014 (i.e., dry environment and low relative humidity), the photosynthetic rate, transpiration rate and water use efficiency were highest under T₂ treatment, which was caused by the increase in stomatal conductance. However, in July 2015 (i.e., wet environment and high relative humidity), the photosynthetic rate and water use efficiency were higher under T₁ and T₂ treatments, which were caused by the increase in actual quantum efficiency and stomatal conductance. Our results implied that under frequent grazing treatment, S. grandis had small height and efficient compensatory photosynthesis, which promoted its resistance to severe grazing.  aPublisher supplied data 3aStipa grandis 3aarid lands 3abiomass 3achlorophyll 3adry environmental conditions 3adry matter partitioning 3agrazing 3aleaves 3aphotosynthesis 3aplant height 3arelative humidity 3astems 3asteppes 3astomatal conductance 3awater use efficiency 3awet environmental conditions 3aChina1 aHuang, Qi1 aMi, Xue1 aBai, Yunxiao1 aZhang, Meng1 aLi, Xu0 tJournal of Arid Land.g2018 Aug., v. 10, no. 4 p.601-611dScience PresswJournal:21602x1674-67677nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s40333-018-0011-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02894naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100002300188245013800211300001100349500001100360506007600371520128100447592002801728506003701756650002101793650002401814650001701838650001101855650001301866650002001879650001401899650002301913650002601936650001001962650001901972650002301991650001402014650002802028650000902056650001402065650001402079650001602093700002102109700002002130700001902150700002102169773007202190856008102262852000902343655001202352IND60548451020221207094213.0170724e201612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054845102DNAL7 a10.1186/s12284-016-0095-42doi7 aPMC48705482pmcid7 a271783002pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMizobuchi, Ritsuko10aQTLs for Resistance to Major Rice Diseases Exacerbated by Global Warming: Brown Spot, Bacterial Seedling Rot, and Bacterial Grain Rot  ap. 23.  aReview  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aIn rice (Oryza sativa L.), damage from diseases such as brown spot, caused by Bipolaris oryzae, and bacterial seedling rot and bacterial grain rot, caused by Burkholderia glumae, has increased under global warming because the optimal temperature ranges for growth of these pathogens are relatively high (around 30 °C). Therefore, the need for cultivars carrying genes for resistance to these diseases is increasing to ensure sustainable rice production. In contrast to the situation for other important rice diseases such as blast and bacterial blight, no genes for complete resistance to brown spot, bacterial seedling rot or bacterial grain rot have yet been discovered. Thus, rice breeders have to use partial resistance, which is largely influenced by environmental conditions. Recent progress in molecular genetics and improvement of evaluation methods for disease resistance have facilitated detection of quantitative trait loci (QTLs) associated with resistance. In this review, we summarize the results of worldwide screening for cultivars with resistance to brown spot, bacterial seedling rot and bacterial grain rot and we discuss the identification of QTLs conferring resistance to these diseases in order to provide useful information for rice breeding programs.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aBipolaris oryzae 3aBurkholderia glumae 3aOryza sativa 3ablight 3abreeding 3acrop production 3acultivars 3adisease resistance 3aenvironmental factors 3agenes 3aglobal warming 3amolecular genetics 3apathogens 3aquantitative trait loci 3arice 3ascreening 3aseedlings 3atemperature1 aFukuoka, Shuichi1 aTsushima, Seiya1 aYano, Masahiro1 aSatō, Hiroyuki,0 tRice.g2016 Dec., v. 9, no. 1 p.23-23dSpringer USx1939-84257nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12284-016-0095-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02839naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245010700168520138500275592002801660650002201688650001501710650001901725650001401744650002001758650003001778650001501808650001701823650002201840650001101862650001701873650001401890650001101904650002601915650002401941650001601965653002701981653001802008653002102026653002602047700001402073700001702087700001702104700001502121773011402136856008602250852000902336655001202345IND60747997520221121093933.0211129e20220115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074799752DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhazmat.2021.1269312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDing, Junyan10aUnderstanding A-site tuning effect on formaldehyde catalytic oxidation over La-Mn perovskite catalysts  aA combination study of density functional theory (DFT) calculation and microkinetic analysis was carried out to investigate A-site tuning effect on formaldehyde (HCHO) oxidation over La-Mn perovskite catalysts (A = Sr, Ag, and Sn). The oxygen mobility of A-doped LaMnO₃ catalysts and reaction mechanism of HCHO oxidation on catalyst surfaces were investigated. The microkinetic simulation was performed to quantitatively determine the activity of catalysts toward the HCHO catalytic oxidation. The results indicated that A-site tuning weakens the binding energy of Mn–O bond of LaMnO₃ surface and facilitates the formation of surface oxygen vacancy. The presence of dopants can significantly reduce the activation energy of O₂ dissociation, which ascribes to the facilitation of electron transfer between oxygen species and catalyst surfaces. The reaction cycle of HCHO oxidation contains seven steps: HCHO adsorption, HCHO* dehydrogenation, CHO* dehydrogenation, CO₂ desorption, H₂O desorption, O₂ adsorption and oxygen vacancy recovery. The dopants promote HCHO adsorption and reduce the activation energy of HCHO oxidation. Two elementary steps control the overall reaction rate of HCHO oxidation. CHO* dehydrogenation step has the largest degree of rate control value at low temperature and O₂ adsorption step controls the whole reaction at high temperature  aPublisher supplied data 3aactivation energy 3aadsorption 3acarbon dioxide 3acatalysts 3adehydrogenation 3adensity functional theory 3adesorption 3adissociation 3aelectron transfer 3aenergy 3aformaldehyde 3aoxidation 3aoxygen 3aquantitative analysis 3areaction mechanisms 3atemperature 0aFormaldehyde oxidation 0aA-site tuning 0aLa-Mn perovskite 0aMicrokinetic analysis1 aLiu, Jing1 aYang, Yingju1 aZhao, Liming1 aYu, Yingni0 tJournal of hazardous materials.g2022 Jan. 15, v. 422 p.126931-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6200x0304-38947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2021.1269313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02487naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245013600166300001400302520119400316592002801510596005901538650001701597650001901614650001201633650001401645650002201659650002701681650001401708650002501722650001501747651001001762700001601772700001701788700001601805700005401821773012301875856008201998852000902080655001202089IND60648941020221120083928.0190702e201907  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064894102DNAL7 a10.1007/s10750-019-03977-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKong, Fanjiao10aPopulation genetic structure of the whorl-leaf watermilfoil Myriophyllum verticillatum shaped by topography and geographic distance  ap. 55-64.  aInterpopulation gene flow plays an important role in determining population genetic structure. In this study, we sampled 24 populations of the whorl-leaf watermilfoil Myriophyllum verticillatum from three disjunct regions in China (Northwest China, Northeast China, and the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP) plus Southwest China) with different topographies and examined its population genetic structure using 17 microsatellite loci. Deserts, plains, and mountains are the main geomorphological features of Northwest China, Northeast China, and the QTP plus Southwest China, respectively. High genetic differentiation and genetic isolation by geographic distance were observed at the overall scale and in all three regions. When compared among the three regions, the lowest level of genetic differentiation and weakest correlation between genetic and geographic distances were presented in Northeast China. Two genetic clusters corresponding to Northwest China and the other two regions were identified, suggesting unequal gene flow among the three disjunct regions. Our findings emphasize the role of topography and geographic distance in shaping population genetic structure in aquatic plants.  aPublisher supplied data  a31270265cNational Natural Science Foundation of China 3aMyriophyllum 3aaquatic plants 3adeserts 3agene flow 3agenetic variation 3amicrosatellite repeats 3amountains 3apopulation structure 3atopography 3aChina1 aWu, Zhigang1 aWang, Huijun1 aChen, Jiwen1 aXu, Xinwei1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1309-69400 tHydrobiologia.g2019 July, v. 838, no. 1 p.55-64dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:jnl42390x0018-81587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-019-03977-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04261naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100005900150245013000209300001600339520257900355592002802934650001702962650001202979650001402991650001903005650001403024650001203038650001003050650001203060650002203072650001703094650001803111650001103129650001703140650001803157650001103175650001203186650001803198650002003216650001203236650002403248650001403272650001803286650001103304650001503315653001403330653001403344653000803358653001303366653001603379653001703395700001703412700002003429773011603449856008503565852000903650655001203659IND60617983820221120042332.0200515e20181215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061798382DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foreco.2018.08.0532doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWesterfelt, Per1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2040-830510aPopulation patterns in relation to food and nesting resource for two cavity-nesting bee species in young boreal forest stands  ap. 629-638.  aWild bees have separate food and nest sites, two essential resources that potentially could limit bee populations. Many solitary bee species nest in holes in deadwood. Female bees collect pollen and nectar, which is stored in the nests as a food supply for their offspring. It is not well understood how availability of either resource affects bee species with different life histories. This study aimed to demonstrate the relative importance of food and nesting resources on population size of two cavity-nesting wild bee species that differ in their requirements regarding food- and nesting resource. Standardized trap nests consisting of wooden poles with pre-drilled holes were deployed in 15 young boreal forest stands to monitor bee abundance. At each site the food resource (flowering plants) and nesting resource (holes in deadwood) for hole-nesting solitary bees were surveyed in the nearby surroundings. The food resource was differentiated into flowers occurring in young forest stands and flowers occurring along forest roadsides. Generalized and general linear models were used to predict nest abundance in the trap nests of two bee species. A total of 166 nests of a pollen-specialist species, Megachile lapponica, and 38 nests of a pollen-generalist species, Hylaeus annulatus were found in the traps. The nest abundance of M. lapponica across the sites was predicted only by this species’ specific food resource, fireweed, Chamerion angustifolium, whereas the nest abundance of H. annulatus was predicted by both food and nesting resources. In a simple linear regression, the density of suitable nesting holes for H. annulatus explained 38% of the variation in the number of nests. Corresponding values for the food resource density along sun exposed gravel roadsides and in young forest stands were 63% and 41% respectively. In a multiple regression, the three variables – nesting resource density, food resource density in young forest stands and food resource density along sun exposed roadsides – explained 86% of the variation in abundance of H. annulatus nests. Nesting and food resource densities for H. annulatus were not correlated with each other. Our results imply that creation and retention of standing dead wood are conservation measures that favor H. annulatus since the availability of nest holes in standing dead wood limited population sizes. To locate the high stumps near sun-exposed forest roads with a dense flora should increase the efficiency of this measure since H. annulatus was particularly favored by flower rich roadsides.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAngiospermae 3aHylaeus 3aMegachile 3aboreal forests 3adead wood 3afemales 3aflora 3aflowers 3afood availability 3aforest roads 3aforest stands 3agravel 3alife history 3alinear models 3anectar 3anesting 3anesting sites 3apopulation size 3aprogeny 3aregression analysis 3aroadsides 3asolitary bees 3astumps 3awood poles 0aRetention 0aDead wood 0aBee 0aResource 0aForest road 0aLife history1 aWeslien, Jan1 aWidenfalk, Olof0 tForest ecology and management.g2018 Dec. 15, v. 430 p.629-638dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl9013x0378-11277nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foreco.2018.08.0533Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02225naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001800153245007500171300001600246520105400262592002801316650004401344650001601388650001301404650001101417650003701428650001301465650002101478650003301499700002301532700001801555700001701573700001601590700001801606773009601624856008701720990002301807852000901830655001201839IND60098000120221122214359.0141104e201203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009800012DNAL7 a10.1016/j.eurpolymj.2011.11.0212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMeure, Samuel10aConfirmation of the healing mechanism in a mendable EMAA–epoxy resin  ap. 524-531.  aThe healing of a mendable epoxy resin containing polyethylene-co-methacrylic acid (EMAA) particles has been confirmed to occur via a pressure delivery mechanism of the healing agent, EMAA, into a crack plane during thermal activation. Internal pressure rises within a bubble, formed from interactions between EMAA particles causing expansion of the bubble which subsequently force the healing agent to flow into an available cavity. The use of X-ray ultra-microscopy (Xum), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) provides evidence for volatile formation, bubble expansion and delivery of healing agent. Spectroscopic studies of the interfacial reactions between epoxy and EMAA during post-cure, compared with adhesion and fracture toughness measurements, reveal that hydroxyl acid reactions catalysed via tertiary amine initiate the pressure delivery mechanism. Furthermore, adhesion and FTIR measurements suggest that the re-binding or healing of a crack interface is likely to be dominated by hydrogen bonding.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aX-radiation 3aadhesion 3aenergy 3aenergy-dispersive X-ray analysis 3aepoxides 3ahydrogen bonding 3ascanning electron microscopy1 aVarley, Russell J.1 aWu, Dong Yang1 aMayo, Sherri1 aNairn, Kate1 aFurman, Scott0 tEuropean polymer journal.g2012 Mar., v. 48, no. 3 p.524-531dElsevier Ltdx0014-30577nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.eurpolymj.2011.11.0213Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02513naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245011500167520130300282592002801585650001201613650001601625650002701641650001401668650001001682650001401692651001001706651001301716700002101729700003501750700003001785700002401815700003101839700002201870700002201892773012301914856008102037852000902118655001202127IND60748676020221119172851.0210827e20210722xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074867602DNAL7 a10.3390/pathogens100809262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTedesco, Perla 10aEvaluation of Potential Transfer of the Pathogen Saprolegnia parasitica between Farmed Salmonids and Wild Fish  aSaprolegnia infections are among the main parasitic diseases affecting farmed salmonids. The distribution and potential transfer of Saprolegnia spp. between farms and the natural environment has been scarcely investigated. Therefore, this work aimed to study the diversity and abundance of oomycete species in salmonid farms, tributary water, and effluent water systems. Four trout farms in Italy and two Atlantic salmon farms in Scotland were considered. In Italian farms, 532 isolates of oomycetes were obtained from fish and water, at upstream, inside, and downstream the farms. In Scottish farms, 201 oomycetes isolates were obtained from water outside the farm and from fish and water inside the farming units. Isolates were identified to the species level through amplification and sequencing of the ITS rDNA region. In Italy, S. parasitica was significantly more present in farmed than in wild fish, while in water it was more frequently isolated from the wild, particularly in effluent systems, not associated with more frequent isolation of S. parasitica in wild fish downstream the farm. In Scotland, S. parasitica was the most prevalent species isolated from fish, while isolates from water were mostly Pythium spp. with few S. parasitica isolates from upstream and downstream the farms.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPythium 3aSalmo salar 3aSaprolegnia parasitica 3apathogens 3atrout 3awild fish 3aItaly 3aScotland1 aSaraiva, Marcia 1 aSandoval-Sierra, Jose Vladimir1 aFioravanti, Maria Letizia1 aMorandi, Benedetto 1 aDieguez-Uribeondo, Javier 1 avan West, Pieter 1 aGaluppi, Roberta 0 tPathogens.g2021 July 22, v. 10, no. 8dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27146x2076-08177nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/pathogens100809263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03691naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001500148245014300163300001200306520211700318592002802435650002502463650002902488650003002517650002202547650001902569650001502588650001902603650002302622650001102645650002502656650002302681650001502704650001702719650001702736650001402753650002202767650002102789650001902810650001402829650002002843650001702863700001402880700002302894700001402917700001402931700001902945773010502964856008303069852000903152655001203161IND60779228020221116144153.0221005e202212  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077922802DNAL7 a10.1186/s12870-022-03615-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPang, Fahu10aPlant organ- and growth stage-diversity of endophytic bacteria with potential as biofertilisers isolated from wheat (Triticum aestivum L.)  ap. 276.  aBACKGROUND: Chemical fertilisers are extensively used for crop production, which may cause soil deterioration and water pollution. Endophytic bacteria with plant-growth-promoting (PGP) activities may provide a solution to sustainably improve crop yields, including in-demand staples such as wheat. However, the diversity of the PGP endophytic bacteria in wheat across plant organs and growth stages has not been thoroughly characterised. RESULTS: Here, we report the isolation of endophytic bacteria from root, stem, leaf and seed of three winter wheat varieties at tillering, jointing, heading and seed-filling growth stages that were identified via 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis. Strains were screened for indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) production, potassium and phosphate solubilisation and the ability to grow on a nitrogen-free medium. Strain's capacity to stimulate various plant growth parameters, such as dry root weight, dry above-ground parts weight and plant height, was evaluated in pot trials. A total of 127 strains were randomly selected from 610 isolated endophytic bacterial cultures, representing ten genera and 22 taxa. Some taxa were organ-specific; others were growth-stage-specific. Bacillus aryabhattai, B. stratosphericus, Leclercia adecarboxylata and Pseudomonas oryzihabitans were detected as wheat endophytes for the first time. The IAA production, inorganic phosphorous solubilisation, organic phosphorus solubilisation, potassium solubilisation and growth on N-free medium were detected in 45%, 29%, 37%, 2.4% and 37.8% of the 127 strains, respectively. In pot trials, each strain showed variable effects on inoculated wheat plants regarding the evaluated growth parameters. CONCLUSIONS: Wheat endophytic bacteria showed organ- and growth-stage diversity, which may reflect their adaptations to different plant tissues and seasonal variations, and differed in their PGP abilities. Bacillus was the most predominant bacterial taxa isolated from winter wheat plants. Our study confirmed wheat root as the best reservoir for screening endophytic bacteria with potential as biofertilisers.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacillus aryabhattai 3aLeclercia adecarboxylata 3aPseudomonas oryzihabitans 3aTriticum aestivum 3abiofertilizers 3aendophytes 3afilling period 3aindole acetic acid 3aleaves 3anucleotide sequences 3aorganic phosphorus 3aphosphates 3aplant growth 3aplant height 3apotassium 3asequence analysis 3asoil degradation 3asolubilization 3atillering 3awater pollution 3awinter wheat1 aTao, Aili1 aAyra-Pardo, Camilo1 aWang, Tan1 aYu, Ziwei1 aHuang, Siliang0 tBMC plant biology.g2022 Dec., v. 22, no. 1 p.276-276dBioMed CentralwJournal:2167x1471-22297nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12870-022-03615-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02990naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002100145245005800166300002000224500002000244520169700264592002801961650001701989650002202006650002402028650001102052650001602063650001902079650000902098650001002107650003902117650001902156650002302175650001502198650001002213650001502223700002202238700001702260700001902277700001702296700002102313773011002334856007902444852000902523655001202532IND60571332520221118020723.0170712e201611  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057133252DNAL7 a10.1111/1750-3841.135212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNguyễn, Thùy,10aConsumer Acceptance of a Polyphenolic Coffee Beverage  ap. S2817-S2823.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe objective of this study was to determine if Chardonnay grape seed pomace (GSP), a waste stream of wine production, could be used as a functional ingredient in brewed coffee. Two consumer panels were conducted to assess the acceptance of coffee at coffee replacement (w/w) values of 0% (control), 6.25%, 12.50%, 18.75%, or 25% GSP. The 1st consumer panel (n = 80) assessed the coffee samples served “black.” The 2nd panel (n = 67) assessed the coffee samples with adjustment (that is, sweeteners, milk, and cream) options available. Consumer sensory evaluation involved evaluating the 5 treatments individually for acceptance of appearance, aroma, taste/flavor, and overall acceptance using a 9‐point hedonic scale. A check‐all‐that‐apply questionnaire surveyed the sensory attributes describing aroma, appearance, and taste/flavor of the samples. Oxygen radical absorbance capacity was used to measure the effects of antioxidant levels in GSP coffee samples. Results showed that GSP could be added at 6.25% replacement without significantly affecting the overall consumer acceptance of coffee compared to the control (0% GSP). Above 6.25% GSP supplementation, the coffee beverage was described as more tan, milky, watery/dilute, and mild, and was generally less accepted by the consumers. GSP also increased the antioxidant capacity of the coffee compared to the control (0% GSP), with no significant differences among replacement values. Therefore, 6.25% GSP replacement is recommended for creating coffee beverages acceptable to consumers. Further in vivo investigation may substantiate the free‐radical scavenging capacity of GSP coffee and its potential health benefits.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantioxidants 3acoffee (beverage) 3aconsumer acceptance 3aflavor 3agrape seeds 3ahedonic scales 3amilk 3aodors 3aoxygen radical absorbance capacity 3aquestionnaires 3asensory evaluation 3asweeteners 3ataste 3awinemaking1 aKuchera, Meredith1 aSmoot, Katie1 aDiako, Charles1 aVixie, Beata1 aRoss, Carolyn F.0 tJournal of food science.g2016 Nov., v. 81, no. 11 p.S2817-S2823dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltdx0022-11477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1750-3841.135213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01791naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100002000188245006000208300001600268506007600284520062300360592002800983506003701011650003201048650001301080650001001093650001301103650001401116650001901130650002901149650002701178700001901205773010301224856008101327852000901408655001201417IND60094235920221207141951.0141104e201304  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009423592DNAL7 a10.1016/j.mib.2013.01.0102doi7 aPMC40668152pmcid7 a234338012pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMcGary, Katelyn10aRNA polymerase and the ribosome: the close relationship  ap. 112-117.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aIn bacteria transcription and translation are linked in time and space.

However, the effect of antibiotic residues in manure on PPAD has not been studied. This study investigated the function of PPAD on antibiotic removal and the effect of antibiotic on PPAD performance. Results demonstrated that chlortetracycline (CTC) and oxytetracycline (OTC) concentrations decreased from 17.236 and 183.446 to 0 and 17.348 mg/kg·TS using PPAD, respectively. PPAD for swine manure containing CTC and OTC increased methane production from 244.0 ± 7.6 to 254.0 ± 6.1 mL/g·VS and reduced technical digestion time (T₈₀) from 30 to 25 days compared with AD process. Moreover, PPAD affected only archaeal communities, whereas PP affected bacterial/archaeal communities. Thus, PPAD can be used to treat antibiotic-containing manure and reduce the negative effects of antibiotics.  aPublisher supplied data 0aSwine manure 0aAntibiotics 0aPasteurisation pretreatment 0aAnaerobic digestion 0aPerformance1 aDong, Hongmin1 aZhang, Wanqin1 aZhu, Zhiping1 aShang, Bin1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1480-24720 tBioresource technology.g2020 Feb., v. 297 p.122414-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46263x0960-85247nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2019.1224143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03802naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100003000151245017200181300001400353500001900367520202100386592002802407650002302435650002202458650001902480650002902499650002702528650001402555650002202569650001702591650001902608650001202627650001502639650002702654650002102681650001502702650002502717650001402742650001702756653003002773653003902803653001402842653001302856700002802869700002802897700002602925700002002951700002402971700002802995700001903023773009903042856008603141852000903227655001203236IND60737794520221122005502.0210619e202108  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073779452DNAL7 a10.1016/j.procbio.2021.04.0152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aArulmani, Samuel Raj Babu10aSustainable bioelectricity production from Amaranthus viridis and Triticum aestivum mediated plant microbial fuel cells with efficient electrogenic bacteria selections  ap. 27-37.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aApplication of plant-mediated Microbial fuel cell (PMFC) for bioelectricity production with food crop yield has not yet been appropriately investigated. This study aims to reveal the ability of two essential food plants: Amaranthus viridis (P1) and Triticum aestivum (P2), for sustainable bioenergy production and food harvest for 180 days consecutively. The study showed that the highest power density obtained from P2-PMFC was higher than the P1-PMFC, and the organic-rich nutrient called bioslurry in PMFCs shows twofold intensification in the electrochemical reaction. The main role of bioslurry (brown gold) as a magical organic-rich nutrient increases the plant growth and the activity of electrogenic bacteria in PMFCs. Thus the current density of P1 (114.52 ± 20.05 mA/m²) and P2 (185.23 ± 15.10 mA/m²) without bioslurry was increased with a maximum current density of 185.23 ± 15.10 mA/m² (P1) and 291.23 ± 7.50 mA/m² (P2) with bioslurry. The high content screening technique and scanning electron micrograph confirm the biofilm formation on the rhizosphere-anode region of both the plants. Culturable rhizosphere-anode region bacterial species were isolated in P1 and P2 PMFCs, and their electrogenic activity was confirmed using the single-chambered Microbial fuel cells (MFCs) through polarization test. The constructed phylogenetic tree for the 31 isolates concludes the diversity of all bacterial species, of which the phylum Firmicutes dominates in both PMFCs. The individual polarization curve efficiency of the isolates ranges from 7.62 to 194.45 mW/m², and among the 31 isolates, Hydrogenophaga sp. JBP18, Pseudomonas aeruginosa JBP1, Ralstonia sp. JBP24, Ochrobactrum intermedium strain JBP22 and Bacillus safensis JBP6 were selected as potential electrogenic bacteria. Accordingly, this study might lead to the development of MFC technology for sustainable electricity production using food crop plants and determining more rhizosphere-anode electrogenic bacterial species in the future.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAmaranthus viridis 3aBacillus safensis 3aHydrogenophaga 3aOchrobactrum intermedium 3aPseudomonas aeruginosa 3aRalstonia 3aTriticum aestivum 3abiochemistry 3abioelectricity 3abiofilm 3acrop yield 3aelectricity generation 3aelectrochemistry 3afood crops 3amicrobial fuel cells 3aphylogeny 3aplant growth 0aBioelectricity production 0aPlant-mediated Microbial fuel cell 0aBioenergy 0aBacteria1 aGnanamuthu, Helan Leuca1 aKandasamy, Sabariswaran1 aGovindarajan, Ganesan1 aAlsehli, Mishal1 aElfasakhany, Ashraf1 aPugazhendhi, Arivalagan1 aZhang, Hongguo0 tProcess biochemistry.g2021 Aug., v. 107 p.27-37dElsevier LtdwJournal:12511x1359-51137nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.procbio.2021.04.0153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03494naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002000139245011100159520208800270592002802358650001702386650005002403650001102453650001302464650001202477650001102489650002002500650001302520650002202533650002002555650002102575650001602596650001602612650003002628650002202658650002302680650003302703650000902736650001802745651001302763700002402776700002202800773011902822856007402941852000903015655001203024IND60766978320221119073543.0220211e20220204xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076697832DNAL7 a10.3390/w140304652doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSantha, Nipada 10aArsenic Contamination in Groundwater and Potential Health Risk in Western Lampang Basin, Northern Thailand  aThis research aimed to investigate the spatial distribution of arsenic concentrations in shallow and deep groundwaters which were used as sources for drinking and domestic and agricultural uses. A geochemical modeling software PHREEQC was used to simulate equilibrium geochemical reactions of complex water–rock interactions to identify arsenic speciation and mineral saturation indices based on groundwater quality and hydrogeochemical conditions. In addition, the potential health risk from arsenic-contaminated groundwater consumption was assessed based on the method developed by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. The study area is located at the western part of the Lampang Basin, an intermontane aquifer, Northern Thailand. The area is flat and situated in a floodplain in the Cenozoic basin. Most shallow groundwater (≤10 m depth) samples from dug wells were of Ca-Na-HCO₃ and Ca-HCO₃ types, whereas deep groundwater from Quaternary terrace deposits (30–150 m depth) samples were of Na-HCO₃ and Ca-Na-HCO₃ types. High arsenic concentrations were found in the central part of the study area (Shallow groundwater: <2.8–35 mg/L with a mean of 10.7 mg/L; Deep groundwater: <2.8–480 mg/L with a mean of 51.0 mg/L). According to geochemical modeling study, deep groundwater contained toxic As(III), as the dominant species more than shallow groundwater. Arsenic in groundwater of the Lampang Basin may have been derived from leaching of rocks and could have been the primary source of the subsurface arsenic in the study area. Secondary source of arsenic, which is more significant, could be derived from the leaching of sorbed arsenic in aquifer from co-precipitated Fe-oxyhydroxides in sediments. Quantitative risk assessment showed that the average carcinogenic risk values were as high as 2.78 × 10⁻³ and 7.65 × 10⁻³ for adult and child, respectively, which were higher than the acceptable level (1 × 10⁻⁴). The adverse health impact should be notified or warned with the use of this arsenic-contaminated groundwater without pre-treatment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCenozoic era 3aUnited States Environmental Protection Agency 3aadults 3aaquifers 3aarsenic 3abasins 3acarcinogenicity 3achildren 3acomputer software 3acoprecipitation 3adominant species 3afloodplains 3agroundwater 3agroundwater contamination 3ahydrogeochemistry 3airon oxyhydroxides 3aquantitative risk assessment 3arisk 3awater quality 3aThailand1 aSangkajan, Saowani 1 aSaenton, Schradh 0 tWater.g2022 Feb. 04, v. 14, no. 3dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21688x2073-44417nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w140304653Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03684naa a2200973 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100006400151245009300215300001300308500001900321520137500340592002801715650002601743650002501769650001101794650002801805650002001833650001601853650001001869650001601879650001101895650001201906650001701918650002101935650001301956650001101969650003901980650001902019650001102038650001602049650001402065651001302079653000702092653000802099653000902107653000602116653000702122653001102129653000602140653000602146653000602152653000602158653000602164653000902170653000902179653000702188653000802195653000902203653000802212653001302220653000702233653000602240653000802246653000702254653000702261653000802268653000802276653000802284653000702292653000702299653000702306653000702313653000702320653000702327653000702334653000702341653000802348653000802356653000902364653002002373653002102393700002002414700001902434700002502453700002702478773009802505856008602603852000902689655001202698IND60737794620221122032358.0210619e202108  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073779462DNAL7 a10.1016/j.procbio.2021.05.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGhani, Madiha Javeed1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1100-215410aCharacterization of humic acids produced from fungal liquefaction of low-grade Thar coal  ap. 1-12.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aFungal liquefaction of coal is a promising technology to convert low rank coal into value-added products such as humic acids (HAs) that are extensively used as fertilizer. Use of Pakistani Thar lignite for humic acid extraction can promote agriculture industry in Pakistan. In this study, fifty-five fungal strains were isolated from Thar lignite and screened for their lignite solubilization efficiency. Isolates M13 and MI exhibited highest capacity for lignite solubilization and HA was extracted with 67.4 ± 4.3 percent (w/w) yield. Elemental analysis showed increased nitrogen (0.72–1.39 percent) and oxygen (41.7–48 percent), and decreased carbon (51.8–46.1 percent) and sulphur (1.18–0.73 percent) contents in bio-extracted HA (bHA) compared to chemically extracted HA (cHA). UV/Vis spectroscopy showed increased E4/E6 value from 5.6 ± 0.39 (cHA) to 6.28 ± 0.35 (bHA) indicating reduced molecular mass and aromaticity and increased bioactivity of molecule. FTIR analysis also confirmed these results. HPLC analysis of bHA and cHA showed typical choromatogram of humic acids. Enzyme activity staining indicated the presence of fungal cellulase and xylanase on SDS-PAGE gel. The degradation of lignite macromolecules by lignin degrading fungi is a complex process dependent on alkaline substances, chelators, surfactants and extracellular fungal enzymes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural industry 3abioactive properties 3acarbon 3aendo-1,4-beta-glucanase 3aenzyme activity 3afertilizers 3afungi 3ahumic acids 3alignin 3alignite 3aliquefaction 3amolecular weight 3anitrogen 3aoxygen 3apolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis 3asolubilization 3asulfur 3avalue added 3axylanases 3aPakistan 0aHA 0arpm 0aNaoH 0aM 0anm 0aUV/Vis 0aC 0aH 0aN 0aS 0aO 0aFTIR 0aHPLC 0aFA 0apsi 0aAOAC 0aITS 0aSDS-PAGE 0amL 0ag 0aCFF 0aWB 0aHI 0aHCL 0abHA 0acHA 0aCu 0aCr 0aFe 0aMg 0aMn 0aNi 0aPb 0aZn 0akDa 0aStd 0arRNA 0aBioliquefaction 0aCoal degradation1 aAkhtar, Kalsoom1 aKhaliq, Shazia1 aAk̲h̲tar, Nasrīn,1 aGhauri, Muhammad Afzal0 tProcess biochemistry.g2021 Aug., v. 107 p.1-12dElsevier LtdwJournal:12511x1359-51137nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.procbio.2021.05.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02371naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002400145245011600169300002000285500002000305520100900325592002801334650002401362650001401386650001901400650001101419650001501430650001601445650001901461650001101480650002301491650002601514650002201540650001101562650001901573650001601592650001801608650001601626700002401642700002201666700002701688773011001715856007901825852000901904655001201913IND60571332720221118020801.0170712e201611  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057133272DNAL7 a10.1111/1750-3841.135022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGallego, M Gabriela10aAnalytical Characterization of Polyphenols from Tara and Caesalpinia decapetala as Stabilizers of O/W Emulsions  ap.

Liquid chromatography (LC) combined with mass spectrometry (MS), using a hybrid quadrupole time‐of‐flight (QTOF) mass spectrometer, was employed for (1) the identification of potential antioxidant species in the extracts and (2) to follow their evolution through aging of the emulsions. CS extracts, containing esters and conjugated forms of gallic acid (GA), turned out to be more effective than CD, rich in flavonoid species, in stabilizing the O/W emulsions. After 3 wk at 33 °C, peroxide values of emulsions stabilized with CS and CD extracts were 6.7 and 18.2 meq hydroperoxides/kg, respectively. Responses measured for the oligomers and esterified forms of GA in CS containing emulsions decreased with time; however, the response for the free form of GA kept increasing.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCaesalpinia spinosa 3aemulsions 3aesterification 3aesters 3aflavonoids 3agallic acid 3ahydroperoxides 3aleaves 3alipid peroxidation 3aliquid chromatography 3amass spectrometry 3amodels 3aperoxide value 3apolyphenols 3aspectrometers 3astabilizers1 aRodríguez, Tamara,1 aRodríguez, Isaac1 aAlmajano, María Pilar0 tJournal of food science.g2016 Nov., v. 81, no. 11 p.C2676-C2685dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltdx0022-11477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1750-3841.135023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04036naa a2200649 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001600153245013900169520208200308592002802390650001202418650002002430650001202450650002002462650002402482650002902506650001502535650002002550650001502570650001302585650001902598650002302617650002602640650001302666650002902679650001502708650002302723650001602746650000902762650001802771650002402789650001802813650001902831650001002850653003102860653003402891653002702925700005302952700001403005700001203019700001803031700001603049700001703065700001203082700001403094700001903108700001703127700001403144773011903158856008803277852000903365655001203374IND60678307220221122053719.0200210e20200220xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067830722DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.1354132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Qianwei10aEcoenzymatic stoichiometry and microbial nutrient limitations in rhizosphere soil along the Hailuogou Glacier forefield chronosequence  aMountain glaciers retreat at an increased rate under global warming, resulting in exposed barren surfaces for primary succession. Soil microbes are an important driver of ecosystem processes. Although variations in soil microbes after deglaciation have been studied extensively, the roles of rhizosphere soil microbes in the biogeochemistry cycle during primary succession are less understood. In this study, Populus purdomii was present throughout the 123-year chronosequence as a representative tree species. We therefore investigated variations in the rhizosphere enzyme activity, microbial community structure, and ecoenzymatic stoichiometry of P. purdomii along Hailuogou Glacier chronosequences. The objective was to determinechanges in rhizosphere enzyme activities and microbial communities, as well as the effects of nutrient limitation on rhizosphere microbes. According to the results, the enzyme activities and microbial group biomass in rhizosphere soil all showed a bimodal trend and were highest at the 43rd or 123rd year, and enzyme activity varied with succession time but not microbial community structure. The rhizosphere soil bacterial community was the dominant community during the 123-year chronosequence. Ecoenzymatic stoichiometry indicated nitrogen restrictions on microbial activity throughout primary succession, with early succession stages (5–15 years) showing greater carbon restriction than late succession stages. Moreover, redundancy and correlation analyses demonstrated that soil microbial phospholipid fatty acid biomass was an important factor for increases in enzyme activities and that enzyme activities in turn played important roles in carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus cycling in rhizosphere soil. Additionally, rhizosphere soil microbial development significantly affected soil organic carbon, total nitrogen and dissolved organic carbon accumulation. Overall, our study links the rhizosphere microbial community and activity to successional chronosequences, providing a deeper understanding of the dynamics of ecosystem succession.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPopulus 3abiogeochemistry 3abiomass 3achronosequences 3acommunity structure 3adissolved organic carbon 3aecosystems 3aenzyme activity 3aglaciation 3aglaciers 3aglobal warming 3amicrobial activity 3amicrobial communities 3anitrogen 3aphospholipid fatty acids 3aphosphorus 3aprimary succession 3arhizosphere 3asoil 3asoil bacteria 3asoil organic carbon 3astoichiometry 3atotal nitrogen 3atrees 0aEcoenzymatic stoichiometry 0aMicrobial nutrient limitation 0aGlacier chronosequence1 aLiu, Yang1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0019-94461 aGu, Yunfu1 aGuo, Li1 aHuang, Youyou1 aZhang, Jian1 aXu, Zhenfeng1 aTan, Bo1 aZhang, Li1 aChen, Lianghua1 aXiao, Jiujin1 aZhu, Peng0 tScience of the total environment.g2020 Feb. 20, v. 704 p.135413-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.1354133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03294naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094024002200125024001900147040001800166100001900184245013900203300001800342506007600360520166100436592002802097506003702125650002602162650001702188650002502205650001702230650002302247650002202270650001802292650001202310650001102322650002602333650001402359650002602373700002102399700001902420700002402439700001802463700002002481700001802501700002102519700001802540700001702558773011502575856007702690852000902767655001202776IND60171892320221207081809.0150602e201211  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6017189232DNAL7 a10.1104/pp.112.2051382doi7 aPMC34905822pmcid7 a229878852pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNeumann, Piotr10aCrystal Structures of Physcomitrella patens AOC1 and AOC2: Insights into the Enzyme Mechanism and Differences in Substrate Specificity  ap. 1251-1266.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aIn plants, oxylipins regulate developmental processes and defense responses. The first specific step in the biosynthesis of the cyclopentanone class of oxylipins is catalyzed by allene oxide cyclase (AOC) that forms cis(+)-12-oxo-phytodienoic acid. The moss Physcomitrella patens has two AOCs (PpAOC1 and PpAOC2) with different substrate specificities for C ₁₈- and C ₂₀-derived substrates, respectively. To better understand AOC’s catalytic mechanism and to elucidate the structural properties that explain the differences in substrate specificity, we solved and analyzed the crystal structures of 36 monomers of both apo and ligand complexes of PpAOC1 and PpAOC2. From these data, we propose the following intermediates in AOC catalysis: (1) a resting state of the apo enzyme with a closed conformation, (2) a first shallow binding mode, followed by (3) a tight binding of the substrate accompanied by conformational changes in the binding pocket, and (4) initiation of the catalytic cycle by opening of the epoxide ring. As expected, the substrate dihydro analog cis-12,13 S -epoxy-9 Z ,15 Z -octadecadienoic acid did not cyclize in the presence of PpAOC1; however, when bound to the enzyme, it underwent isomerization into the corresponding trans-epoxide. By comparing complex structures of the C ₁₈ substrate analog with in silico modeling of the C ₂₀ substrate analog bound to the enzyme allowed us to identify three major molecular determinants responsible for the different substrate specificities (i.e. larger active site diameter, an elongated cavity of PpAOC2, and two nonidentical residues at the entrance of the active site).  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aPhyscomitrella patens 3aactive sites 3aallene-oxide cyclase 3abiosynthesis 3acatalytic activity 3acrystal structure 3aisomerization 3aligands 3amodels 3amosses and liverworts 3aoxylipins 3asubstrate specificity1 aBrodhun, Florian1 aSauer, Kristin1 aHerrfurth, Cornelia1 aHamberg, Mats1 aBrinkmann, Jens1 aScholz, Julia1 aDickmanns, Achim1 aFeussner, Ivo1 aFicner, Ralf0 tPlant physiology.g2012 Nov., v. 160, no. 3 p.1251-1266dAmerican Society of Plant Biologistsx0032-08897nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1104/pp.112.2051383Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03021naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100005500147245013000202520167700332592002802009650002002037650001802057650001702075650001102092650001802103650001802121650001602139650003002155650001302185650001402198650001802212650001302230650002102243650001102264653001702275653001102292653002602303653001402329700001502343700002002358773010702378856008102485852000902566655001202575IND60683243120221121173148.0200207e20200207xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068324312DNAL7 a10.1017/S0022149X200000612doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLeiva, N.V.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4872-611310aGeographic and ontogenetic variations in parasite communities of intertidal fish species from the south-eastern Pacific coast  aParasite composition can be affected by physiological and ecological changes during host ontogeny. Intertidal fish do not travel long distances and live in the same area throughout their lifetimes, meaning that parasite communities can differ across geographic ranges. The objective of this study was to analyse the parasite communities of three fish species (Hypsoblennius sordidus, Helcogrammoides cunninghami and Scartichthys viridis) collected from the Chilean coast. The composition of parasite species was compared among host ontogenetic stages (larvae, juveniles and mature fish) and geographic areas. A total of 184 larval, 252 juveniles and 217 mature individuals were collected in the northern area (c. 24°S), and 186 larval, 192 juveniles and 112 mature individuals from the central area (c. 33°S). Ectoparasites were most prevalent in fish from the central area, whereas endoparasites were most prevalent in the northern area. The parasite species richness varied significantly between geographical areas for H. sordidus and H. cunninghami, but the parasite composition varied significantly between geographical areas for all fish species analysed. Therefore, the geographical area was the most important factor determining the parasite composition of intertidal fish species. The absence of endoparasites in fish larvae and the increased infestation in juvenile and mature fish may be explained by the shift in habitat from the water column to intertidal pools where prey abundance and availability are higher. On the other hand, hydrographic barriers affecting prey distributions may also offer an explanation as to the differences in parasite composition.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHelcogrammoides 3aHypsoblennius 3aScartichthys 3acoasts 3aectoparasites 3aendoparasites 3afish larvae 3ageographical distribution 3ahabitats 3ajuveniles 3alittoral zone 3aontogeny 3aspecies richness 3atravel 0aBiogeography 0afishes 0aintertidal rocky zone 0aparasites1 aMuñoz, G.1 aGonzález, M.T.0 tJournal of helminthology.g, v. 94 p.e124-dCambridge University PresswJournal:23124x1475-26977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0022149X200000613Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02671naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002800147245015300175520148200328592002801810650001601838650001601854650002501870650001101895650002101906650001301927650001901940653000801959653001101967653002001978653003201998700002002030700003002050700002702080773009902107856008202206852000902288655001202297IND60700907520221122223901.0220228e20200915xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070090752DNAL7 a10.1016/j.lfs.2020.1180462doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKourosh-Arami, Masoumeh10aPhospholipase Cβ3 in the hippocampus may mediate impairment of memory by long-term blockade of orexin 1 receptors assessed by the Morris water maze  aOrexin-A is an endogenous peptide with receptors throughout the brain. According to some recent research, learning and memory are affected by the central administration of orexin; however, no study so far has investigated the long-term inhibition of the orexinergic system. The present study has evaluated the effect of pretraining administration of orexin 1 receptor (OXR1) antagonist, SB-334867, on the acquisition of memory. The Morris water maze (MWM) task was used for training and trial purposes in all groups. Memory performance was analyzed by measuring escape latency, traveled distance, and time spent in the target quadrant. Moreover, the effect of SB-334867 on phospholipase Cβ3 (PLCβ3) levels in the CA1 region of hippocampus slices was examined. Hippocampus slices were prepared using an immunohistochemistry (IHC) approach. SB-334867 (20 mg/kg) increased escape latency in SB-treated rats compared to SB-vehicle group (P < 0.01). SB-treated rats spent less time in the target quadrant compared to the SB-vehicle group (P < 0.001). Distance traveled in the target quadrant was significantly more in SB-treated rats compared to the SB-vehicle group (P < 0.001). Furthermore, SB-334867 decreased PLCβ3 levels in the CA1 of the hippocampus (P < 0.01 and P < 0.05, respectively). Put together, our results suggest that the long-term inhibition of OXR1 plays a prominent role in spatial learning and memory, probably by attenuating PLCβ3 in CA1 neurons.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantagonists 3ahippocampus 3aimmunohistochemistry 3amemory 3amemory disorders 3apeptides 3aphospholipases 0aCA1 0aOrexin 0aPhospholipase C 0aSpatial learning and memory1 aKomaki, Alireza1 aJoghataei, Mohammad Taghi1 aMohsenzadegan, Monireh0 tLife sciences.g2020 Sept. 15, v. 257 p.118046-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:11720x0024-32057nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lfs.2020.1180463Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02206naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001900152245008600171520109300257592002801350653001601378653002001394653002601414653002901440700001601469700001701485700001601502700001601518700001901534700002501553700002001578700005601598773010601654856008701760852000901847655001201856IND60676241120221119081722.0200106e202002  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067624112DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biortech.2019.1224162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYu, Zhengsheng10aRecent advances in the recovery of metals from waste through biological processes  aWastes containing critical metals are generated in various fields, such as energy and computer manufacturing. Metal-bearing wastes are considered as secondary sources of critical metals. The conventional physicochemical methods of metals recovery are energy-intensive and cause further pollution. Low-cost and eco-friendly technologies including biosorbents, bioelectrochemical systems (BESs), bioleaching, and biomineralization, have become alternatives in the recovery of critical metals. However, a relatively low recovery rate and selectivity severely hinder their large-scale applications. Researchers have expanded their focus to exploit novel strain resources and strategies to improve the biorecovery efficiency. The mechanisms and potential applicability of modified biological techniques for improving the recovery of critical metals need more attention. Hence, this review summarize and compare the strategies that have been developed for critical metals recovery, and provides useful insights for energy-efficient recovery of critical metals in future industrial applications.  aPublisher supplied data 0aBiorecovery 0aCritical metals 0aBiological techniques 0aPerformance improvements1 aHan, Huawen1 aFeng, Pengya1 aZhao, Shuai1 aZhou, Tuoyu1 aKakade, Apurva1 aKulshrestha, Saurabh1 aMajeed, Sabahat1 aLi, Xiangkai1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2931-75650 tBioresource technology.g2020 Feb., v. 297 p.122416-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46263x0960-85247nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2019.1224163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02465naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001700155245011900172300001400291520098600305592002801291650002201319650002501341650001601366650001001382650002001392650001801412650001401430650001501444650002601459650001901485650001501504650001501519650001701534650001401551650002601565653002701591653001501618653001301633653001201646653001801658653001801676700002001694700001701714700001601731773011301747856009001860852000901950655001201959IND60534558320221118140636.0190405e201407  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053455832DNAL7 a10.1016/j.smallrumres.2014.04.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMahfuz, S.U.10aEffect of triple super phosphate supplementation on degradability of rice straw and ammonia nitrogen concentration  ap. 15-19.  aTwo way analysis of variance in duplicate were used to assess the degradability of rice straw with triple super phosphate (TSP: Ca (H2PO4)2·CaSO4·2H2O) as a source of phosphorous (P) at six levels (0, 2, 4, 6, 8 and 12g/kg) for each of the five different incubation times (0, 6, 12, 24 and 48h). The effects of P (TSP) levels and time were significant for in vitro dry matter and organic matter degradability. For NH3-N concentration in rumen fluid the effect of P and time were significant. For in vivo digestibility eight bucks average live weight 7.63±0.19kg were selected. The DM, ADF and OM digestibility were significantly higher in P group than control group. The digestibility of CP was higher in P group than control group. It can be concluded that P has an important role in ruminant digestion and metabolism. As low quality forages are deficit in P, supplementation of P can improve the low quality forages. Thus ruminants can proper utilize this low quality forages.  aPublisher supplied data 3aammonium nitrogen 3aanalysis of variance 3abody weight 3abucks 3acalcium sulfate 3adigestibility 3adigestion 3ametabolism 3amonocalcium phosphate 3aorganic matter 3aphosphorus 3arice straw 3arumen fluids 3aruminants 3atriple superphosphate 0aTriple super phosphate 0aRice straw 0aIn vitro 0aIn vivo 0aDegradability 0aDigestibility1 aChowdhury, M.R.1 aKhan, M.M.H.1 aBaset, M.A.0 tSmall ruminant research.g2014 July, v. 120, no. 1 p.15-19dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl44843x0921-44887nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.smallrumres.2014.04.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03291naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002600145245013200171300002000303500002000323520172000343592002802063650002202091650001302113650001602126650001102142650001302153650001202166650002502178650002402203650000902227650001502236650001302251650001102264650003102275650001602306650001502322650002202337650001602359650001902375700002702394700002802421700003702449700002802486700002402514700003702538773011002575856007902685852000902764655001202773IND60571332820221118020816.0170712e201611  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057133282DNAL7 a10.1111/1750-3841.135032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJovanović, Jelena R.10aUltrasound Pretreatment as an Useful Tool to Enhance Egg White Protein Hydrolysis: Kinetics, Reaction Model, and Thermodinamics  ap. C2664-C2675.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe impact of ultrasound waves generated by probe‐type sonicator and ultrasound cleaning bath on egg white protein susceptibility to hydrolysis by alcalase compared to both thermal pretreatment and conventional enzymatic hydrolysis was quantitatively investigated. A series of hydrolytic reactions was carried out in a stirred tank reactor at different substrate concentrations, enzyme concentrations, and temperatures using untreated, and pretreated egg white proteins (EWPs). The kinetic model based on substrate inhibition and second‐order enzyme deactivation successfully predicts the experimental behavior providing an effective tool for comparison and optimization. The ultrasound pretreatments appear to greatly improve the enzymatic hydrolysis of EWPs under different conditions when compare to other methods. The apparent reaction rate constants for proteolysis (k₂) are 0.009, 0.011, 0.053, and 0.045 min⁻¹ for untreated EWPs, and those pretreated with heat, probe‐type sonicator, and ultrasound cleaning bath technologies, respectively. The ultrasound pretreatment also decreases hydrolysis activation (Eₐ) and enzyme deactivation (Ed) energy, enthalpy (ΔH), and entropy (ΔS) of activation and for the probe‐type sonication this decrease is 61.7%, 61.6%, 63.6%, and 32.2%, respectively, but ultrasound has little change in Gibbs free energy value in the temperature range of 318 to 338 K. The content of sulfhydryl groups and ζ potential show a significant increase (P < 0.05) for both applied ultrasound pretreatments and the reduction of particle size distribution are achieved, providing some evidence that the ultrasound causes EWP structural changes affecting the proteolysis rate.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGibbs free energy 3acleaning 3aegg albumen 3aenergy 3aenthalpy 3aentropy 3aenzymatic hydrolysis 3aenzyme inactivation 3aheat 3ahydrolysis 3akinetics 3amodels 3aparticle size distribution 3aproteolysis 3asubtilisin 3asulfhydryl groups 3atemperature 3azeta potential1 aStefanović, Andrea B.1 aŠekuljica, Nataša Ž.1 aTanasković, Sonja M.

In this paper, we describe a tin-free protocol that provides direct access to lactones via hydrolysis of labile thioketal intermediates. Analysis of several systems of varying complexity reveals that the reaction is most applicable for constrained systems in which the reacting center is prepositioned near the radical-accepting alkene.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemical structure 3afree radicals 3ahydrolysis 3alactones 3aorganic chemistry1 aMason, Jeremy W.1 aMoreau, Benoît1 aWulff, Jeremy E.0 tJournal of organic chemistry.g2012 July 20, v. 77, no. 14 p.6332-6339dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-69047nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fjo300939f3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03093naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006100148245012700209300001600336520151400352592002801866596005601894596004901950650002601999650003102025650003302056650003902089650001102128650002002139650001602159650001002175650001302185650000902198650001402207650002002221650002202241650001602263650001202279651001402291700002202305700002602327700002102353700002002374773012502394856008302519852000902602655001202611IND60779228420221116144147.0220606e202205  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077922842DNAL7 a10.1007/s13313-022-00860-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPetronaitis, Toni1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1559-607310aStubble trouble! Moisture, pathogen fitness and cereal type drive colonisation of cereal stubble by three fungal pathogens  ap. 363-368.  aStubble-borne cereal diseases are a major constraint to production in Australia, with associated costs rising as a result of increased adoption of conservation agriculture systems. The fungal pathogens that cause these diseases can saprotrophically colonise retained cereal residues, which may further increase inoculum levels post-harvest. Hence, saprotrophic colonisation by the stubble-borne fungal pathogens Fusarium pseudograminearum, Pyrenophora tritici-repentis and Bipolaris sorokiniana were compared under a range of moisture conditions for stubble of six cereal varieties (two bread wheat, two barley, one durum wheat and one oat). Sterile cereal stubble was inoculated separately with two isolates of each pathogen and placed, standing, under constant relative humidity conditions (90, 92.5, 95, 97.5 and 100%) for 7 days at 25 °C. Stubble was then cultured in increments of 1 cm to determine the percentage colonisation height of each tiller. Fusarium pseudograminearum colonised farther within tillers, leaving a greater proportion of the standing stubble colonised compared with B. sorokiniana and P. tritici-repentis, suggesting F. pseudograminearum has higher saprotrophic fitness. Saprotrophic colonisation also increased with increasing relative humidity for all pathogens and varied by cereal type. Disease management strategies, such as reduced cereal harvest height, may limit saprotrophic colonisation and improve stubble-borne disease management in conservation agriculture systems.  aPublisher supplied data  aBLG211cGrains Research and Development Corporation  aBLG211cNSW Department of Primary Industries 3aBipolaris sorokiniana 3aFusarium pseudograminearum 3aPyrenophora tritici-repentis 3aagricultural conservation practice 3abarley 3adisease control 3adurum wheat 3afungi 3ainoculum 3aoats 3apathogens 3aplant pathology 3arelative humidity 3asaprotrophs 3astubble 3aAustralia1 aForknall, Clayton1 aSimpfendorfer, Steven1 aBackhouse, David1 aFlavel, Richard0 tAustralasian plant pathology.g2022 May, v. 51, no. 3 p.363-368dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl32209x0815-31917nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13313-022-00860-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02107naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001700139245008500156520098000241592002801221650001301249650002801262650001301290650001801303650002201321650001401343650001401357650000701371650001801378650001601396650001301412650002501425700002901450700002101479700001901500773011901519856007401638852000901712655001201721IND60766978620221119073635.0220211e20220204xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076697862DNAL7 a10.3390/w140304672doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOnga, Liina 10aOxidation of Aqueous Dexamethasone Solution by Gas-Phase Pulsed Corona Discharge  aThe most widely used anti-inflammatory corticosteroid dexamethasone (DXM), frequently detected in waterbodies due to its massive consumption and incomplete removal in wastewater treatment processes, was experimentally studied for oxidation with gas-phase pulsed corona discharge (PCD) varied in pulse repetition frequency, pH, DXM initial concentration and additions of surfactant sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS) and tert-butyl alcohol (TBA). The experimental study also included ozonation as compared to PCD in energy efficiency. The advantageous energy efficiency of PCD was observed in wide spans of pH and DXM initial concentrations surpassing ozonation by about 2.4 times. Identified transformation by- and end-products (fluoride and acetate), as well as the impact of radical scavengers, point to the prevalent radical oxidation of DXM. Somewhat increased toxicity observed on the course of PCD-treatment of high DXM concentrations presents a subject for further studies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetates 3aadrenal cortex hormones 3aalcohols 3adexamethasone 3aenergy efficiency 3aoxidation 3aozonation 3apH 3asurface water 3asurfactants 3atoxicity 3awastewater treatment1 aKattel-Salusoo, Eneliis 1 aTrapido, Marina 1 aPreis, Sergei 0 tWater.g2022 Feb. 04, v. 14, no. 3dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21688x2073-44417nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w140304673Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02355naa a2200337 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002400075024005100099040001800150100001900168245010700187300001400294500001900308500000900327520127500336592002801611650001301639650000901652650002801661650001101689650001601700650001501716650001401731700001801745700001601763773011901779852000901898856009801907655001202005991585563880742620221119082201.0191122e197801  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aCAIN7890648852DNAL7 a10.2135/cropsci1978.0011183X001800010023x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCrosbie, T.

Our experiments were grown for 2 years at one location. Genotypic correlations among these traits were calculated to determine if selection for high CER would cause correlated responses in other traits. We also studied possible physiological limitations to grain and dry matter yield of these inbreds. Genotypic correlations between CER and plant traits were low, suggesting that one could develop high CER genotypes displaying various morphological traits. Nonsignificant correlations between CER and yield traits indicated CER was not the primary factor limiting yield of these inbreds. Correlations showed that dry matter yield was limited by amount of leaf area and by traits associated with efficient use of light energy. We concluded grain yield of these inbred lines was limited by sink size and by lack of a receptive sink because: 1) grain yield was highly correlated with ear length, ear diameter, 300-kernel weight, and number of ears per plant and 2) potential dry-matter production during grain filling was 208 g plant -¹ compared with 49.6 g plant-¹ actually stored in the grain.  aPublisher supplied data 3aZea mays 3acorn 3adry matter accumulation 3aenergy 3agrain yield 3ainbreeding 3aleaf area1 aPearce, R.

Widely expressed in the plant, they mediate calcium transport from the cytosol to the vacuole lumen using the proton gradient across the tonoplast. Here, we report an unexpected role of CAX1 and CAX3 in regulating apoplastic pH and describe how they contribute to auxin transport using the guard cell’s response as readout of hormone signaling and cross talk. We show that indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) inhibition of abscisic acid (ABA)-induced stomatal closure is impaired in cax1 , cax3 , and cax1 / cax3 . These mutants exhibited constitutive hypopolarization of the plasma membrane, and time-course analyses of membrane potential revealed that IAA-induced hyperpolarization of the plasma membrane is also altered in these mutants. Both ethylene and 1-naphthalene acetic acid inhibited ABA-triggered stomatal closure in cax1 , cax3 , and cax1 / cax3 , suggesting that auxin signaling cascades were functional and that a defect in IAA transport caused the phenotype of the cax mutants. Consistent with this finding, chemical inhibition of AUX1 in wild-type plants phenocopied the cax mutants. We also found that cax1/cax3 mutants have a higher apoplastic pH than the wild type, further supporting the hypothesis that there is a defect in IAA import in the cax mutants. Accordingly, we were able to fully restore IAA inhibition of ABA-induced stomatal closure in cax1 , cax3 , and cax1/cax3 when stomatal movement assays were carried out at a lower extracellular pH. Our results suggest a network linking the vacuolar cation exchangers to apoplastic pH maintenance that plays a crucial role in cellular processes.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aabscisic acid 3acalcium 3acations 3acytosol 3aethylene 3aguard cells 3ahomeostasis 3aindole acetic acid 3amembrane potential 3amutants 3anaphthaleneacetic acid 3apH 3aphenotype 3aplasma membrane 3astomatal movement 3atonoplast 3atransporters 3avacuoles1 aVilliers, Florent1 aKroniewicz, Laetitia1 aLee, Sangmee1 aSeo, You Jin1 aHirschi, Kendal D.1 aLeonhardt, Nathalie1 aKwak, June M.0 tPlant physiology.g2012 Nov., v. 160, no. 3 p.1293-1302dAmerican Society of Plant Biologistsx0032-08897nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1104/pp.112.2014423Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01764naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002900147245004300176300001600219520082400235592002801059650001801087650002401105650002501129650002101154650002401175700001801199700002201217700001801239773010301257856008101360852000901441655001201450IND60094236720221118070323.0141104e201306  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009423672DNAL7 a10.1016/j.mib.2013.04.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMichallet, Marie-Cécile10aInnate receptors for adaptive immunity  ap. 296-302.  aPattern recognition receptors (PRRs) are commonly known as sensor proteins crucial for the early detection of microbial or host-derived stress signals by innate immune cells. Interestingly, some PRRs are also expressed and functional in cells of the adaptive immune system. These receptors provide lymphocytes with innate sensing abilities; for example, B cells express Toll-like receptors, which are important for the humoral response. Strikingly, certain other NOD-like receptors are not only highly expressed in adaptive immune cells, but also exert functions related specifically to adaptive immune system pathways, such as regulating antigen presentation. In this review, we will focus particularly on the current understanding of PRR functions intrinsic to B and T lymphocytes; a developing aspect of PRR biology.  aPublisher supplied data 3aT-lymphocytes 3aToll-like receptors 3aantigen presentation 3ahumoral immunity 3amicrobial detection1 aRota, Giorgia1 aMaslowski, Kendle1 aGuarda, Greta0 tCurrent opinion in microbiology.g2013 June, v. 16, no. 3 p.296-302dElsevier Ltdx1369-52747nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.mib.2013.04.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01650naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001800149245008500167506002800252520059900280592002800879506003700907650002600944650002100970650002200991650001801013650001201031650001801043700001801061700002101079700002401100773009601124856008301220852000901303655001201312IND60739680120221207101409.0200302s2020    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073968012DNAL7 a10.1051/bioconf/202017001752doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRodnina, N.V.10aAgrarian and economic aspect of food supply and its safety at the regional level  aResource is Open Access  aThe article deals with the need of increasing the competitiveness of rural areas in the food market and the share of local products in food supply of the population of the Saha Republic with local products.

Brown blotch is caused by Rhizoctonia solani and is regarded as among the foremost diseases of Agrostis lawns. We sought to explore the effects of 2,3-BD treatments on the antioxidant metabolism and sucrose metabolism in brown blotch disease of creeping bentgrass (Agrostis stolonifera cv. Penn A4). The results showed that when exogenous 2,3-BD was applied by soil injection before creeping bentgrass seedlings were inoculated with Rhizoctonia solani for nine days, such pretreatment could effectively reduce the disease index of turf brown blotch. However, we reported reduced accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), including the H₂O₂ content and O₂•⁻ generation rate, the OH• concentration, lipoxygenase activity, and the malondialdehyde content following pathogen infection. 2,3-BD induction amplified the activities of antioxidant enzymes (catalase, superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione peroxidase, and ascorbate peroxidase) while simultaneously increasing glutathione and ascorbate contents. These responses are approaches to scavenge ROS associated with pathogen infection. The pathogen also triggers a change in sugar contents and defense reactions in plants (including the redistribution of plant sugars). Of note, 2,3-BD pretreatment can regulate sucrose synthase-synthesis and sucrose synthase-cleavage and regulate the activity of sucrose phosphate synthase and sucrose phosphate phosphatase in plant sucrose metabolism. These events contribute to significant changes in the soluble sugar components and reduce the loss of sucrose. Collectively, these data strongly suggest that 2,3-BD can induce both antioxidant metabolism and sucrose metabolism in creeping bentgrass, thereby increasing its resistance to brown blotch (Rhizoctonia solani).  aPublisher supplied data  a31360583cNational Natural Science Foundation of China 3aAgrostis stolonifera 3aThanatephorus cucumeris 3aascorbate peroxidase 3abutanediol 3acatalase 3aglutathione 3aglutathione peroxidase 3alawns and turf 3alipoxygenases 3amalondialdehyde 3ametabolism 3apathogens 3aphosphates 3aplant pathology 3asoil injection 3asucrose 3asucrose-phosphate synthase 3asuperoxide dismutase 3asystemic acquired resistance1 aMa, Yuan1 aMa, Huiling1 aYang, Wei0 tAustralasian plant pathology.g2022 May, v. 51, no. 3 p.281-294dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl32209x0815-31917nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13313-022-00853-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01373naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001400140245014800154300002000302520039300322592002800715650002100743650001300764650002700777650001900804700001500823700001300838700001300851773012400864856007400988852000901062655001201071IND60667638820221123041228.0190919e20150622xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066763882DNAL7 a10.1039/c5ra08397d2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBai, Feng10aAssistant effect of poly(methyl methacrylate)-grafted carbon nanotubes on the beta polymorph of poly(vinylidene fluoride) during microinjection  ap. 54171-54174.  aPoly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) with numerous electroactive beta crystals was obtained via melt-processing under the coupled effects of an external flow field generated by microinjection and by dipole–dipole interaction with poly(methyl methacrylate)-grafted carbon nanotubes, which represents a significant route for expanding the potential applications of piezoelectric PVDF devices.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon nanotubes 3acrystals 3apolymethylmethacrylate 3athermoplastics1 aChen, Gang1 aNie, Min1 aWang, Qi0 tRSC advances.g2015 June 22, v. 5, no. 67 p.54171-54174dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c5ra08397d3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02135naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245016300164300001600327520108400343592002801427650002801455650002601483650001601509650000901525700002801534700001801562700001701580773014501597856008201742852000901824655001201833IND60593177620221118220610.0180619e201805  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059317762DNAL7 a10.1007/s00107-017-1269-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJiang, Jiali10aComparison of moisture-dependent orthotropic Young’s moduli of Chinese fir wood determined by ultrasonic wave method and static compression or tension tests  ap. 953-964.  aWood with distinctively different properties in the longitudinal, radial and tangential directions exhibits a strong moisture-dependent material characteristic in the elastic range. The purpose of this study was to analyze the orthotropic elastic properties of Chinese fir wood [Cunninghamia lanceolata (Lamb.)

The results confirm that the stiffness coefficients obtained by the ultrasound without considering the complete stiffness matrix show significantly higher values than the compression or tension Young’s moduli in all the three anatomical directions at each specific MC. The differences between stiffness coefficients and Young’s moduli were significantly reduced by corrections with Poisson ratio. Only in tangential direction, the Young’s moduli with Poisson ratio correction are statistically equivalent to the Young’s moduli obtained by compression and tension.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCunninghamia lanceolata 3amodulus of elasticity 3aultrasonics 3awood1 aBachtiar, ErikValentine1 aLu, Jianxiong1 aNiemz, Peter0 tEuropean journal of wood and wood products.g2018 May, v. 76, no. 3 p.953-964dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl17107x0018-37687nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00107-017-1269-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01926naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002000145245007600165300002000241500002000261520084100281592002801122650001101150650001901161650002401180650001301204650001301217650002001230650001201250650001801262650001601280650002301296650001601319700001901335773011001354856007901464852000901543655001201552IND60571333120221118020800.0170712e201611  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057133312DNAL7 a10.1111/1750-3841.135072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJun‐hong, Liu10aTechnology Optimization of Lysozyme's Fresh Maintaining Effect on Apple  ap.

Currently, lysozyme is widely used in various fields, such as medicine, fruit, and vegetable industry, dairy industry, and so on. Therefore, the exploitation and utilization of lysozyme is of significant economic benefit. Taking apple as material, weight loss ratio and reducing sugar content as objectives, this paper studied the fresh‐keeping effect of lysozyme. Influential factors, lysozyme concentration, soaking time, modified temperature, and reaction time were discussed in detail. The results showed that reducing sugar content was 2.043% and the weight loss ratio was the minimum in the presence of soaking time of 2 min, modified temperature of 65 °C, reaction time of 4 d, and lysozyme concentration of 0.5 g/L.  aPublisher supplied data 3aapples 3adairy industry 3afinancial economics 3alysozyme 3amedicine 3areducing sugars 3asoaking 3asugar content 3atemperature 3avegetable industry 3aweight loss1 aKun‐yu, Wang0 tJournal of food science.g2016 Nov., v. 81, no. 11 p.H2872-H2875dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltdx0022-11477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1750-3841.135073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02704naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001700155245006000172300001600232520149500248592002801743650001601771650002601787650001801813650000901831650001801840650001301858650001201871650001301883650002001896650001301916650001601929653001801945653001801963653001301981653001301994653001602007700001502023700001702038773011602055856009002171852000902261655001202270IND60534558820221118140631.0190405e201409  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053455882DNAL7 a10.1016/j.smallrumres.2014.04.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHögberg, M.10aCan vasopressin induce milk ejection in the dairy goat?  ap. 111-115.  aSuckling increases plasma levels of both oxytocin (OT) and vasopressin (AVP) and intravenous infusions of AVP increase milk flow and milk fat concentration in goats. We hypothesized that vasopressin can cause contraction of the myoepithelial cells and thereby milk ejection. Eight goats were used in each of two series. They were kept together with their kids and were both suckled and hand milked. At experiments, one teat was first emptied by hand and after 3min the same teat was milked again. On control days, cisternal milk (CM) was achieved at the first milking and at the second milking only a small volume of alveolar milk (AM) with modest fat content was received. On experimental days the goats were milked and immediately thereafter OT (10mg) or AVP at the low dose 125ng (AVPL) was injected intravenously followed by the second milking 3min after the first (series I). In series II saline (0.9% NaCl) or vasopressin at the high dose 250ng (AVPH) was injected. The plasma OT concentrations were unchanged after AVP injections. The CM volume did not differ between treatments within each series. Injections of AVPH or OT increased volume and fat content of AM. The proportion of AM to total milk volume was 15% in control experiments, 21% after saline and 29% after AVPL. However, after AVPH and OT the AM proportions were 56 and 57%, respectively, accompanied by an increased fat content. In conclusion, the high dose of AVP elicited a milk ejection reflex similar to that of OT.  aPublisher supplied data 3adairy goats 3aintravenous injection 3alipid content 3amilk 3amilk ejection 3amilk fat 3amilking 3aoxytocin 3asodium chloride 3asuckling 3avasopressin 0aAlveolar milk 0aMilk ejection 0aMilk fat 0aOxytocin 0aVasopressin1 aOlsson, K.1 aDahlborn, K.0 tSmall ruminant research.g2014 Sept., v. 121, no. 1 p.111-115dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl44843x0921-44887nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.smallrumres.2014.04.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02201naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001500140245012200155300002000277520086700297592002801164650001401192650002201206650001301228650001401241650002301255650001101278650001901289650001601308650001201324650001801336650001501354650001301369650002101382650002601403650002801429700001601457700001801473700001501491700001601506700001401522773012401536856007401660852000901734655001201743IND60667638920221117172058.0190919e20150609xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066763892DNAL7 a10.1039/c5ra08401f2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuang, Yun10aSimultaneous enhancement of microalgae biomass growth and lipid accumulation under continuous aeration with 15% CO₂  ap. 50851-50858.  aTo overcome the opposing trends in biomass yield and lipid accumulation, Chlorella PY-ZU1 cultures were continuously aerated with 15% CO₂ to simultaneously enhance biomass yield (2.78 g L⁻¹) and lipid content (47.04%). Microalgal cells consumed almost all the nitrate in the culture after 1 day to synthesize 24 mg L⁻¹ of chlorophyll, which supported a peak growth rate of 0.675 g L⁻¹ per day. Meanwhile, increased expression of key enzymes related to lipid synthesis (e.g., acetyl coenzyme A) enhanced lipid productivity to 192.10 mg L⁻¹ per day. During the growth process, the carbon content of the dried biomass increased from 47.00% to 56.02% while the nitrogen content decreased from 6.36% to 1.99%.

The handling of embryos, including the in vitro production of bovine embryos, is a rapidly evolving area which nonetheless exposes the embryos to unnatural conditions for a period of time. The Fallopian tube provides innumerable quantitative and qualitative factors, all of which guarantee the successful development of the embryo. It is well known that the Fallopian tube can be bypassed, using embryo transfer, resulting in successful implantation in the target recipient animal and the birth of calves. However, the question arises as to whether such circumvention has a negative impact on the embryo during this sensitive development period. First crosstalk between the embryo and its environment confirms mutual recognition activities and indicate bilateral effects. Nowadays, in vitro production of bovine embryos is a well-established technology. However, it is still evident that in vitro generated embryos are not qualitatively comparable to embryos obtained ex vivo. To counteract these differences, comparative studies between in vitro and ex vivo embryos are advantageous, as embryos grown in their physiological environment can provide a blueprint or gold standard against which to compare embryos produced in vitro. Attempts to harness the bovine oviduct were sometimes very invasive and did not result in wide acceptance and routine use. Long-term development and refinement of transvaginal endoscopy for accessing the bovine oviduct has meanwhile been routinely applied for research as well as in practice. Comparative studies combining in vitro development with development in the cattle oviduct revealed that the environmental conditions to which the embryo is exposed before activation of the embryonic genome can have detrimental and lasting effects on its further development. These effects are manifested as deviations in gene expression profiles and methylation signatures as well as frequency of whole chromosomal or segmental aberrations. Furthermore, it was shown that hormonal superstimulation (multiple ovulation and embryo transfer), varying progesterone concentrations as well as metabolic disorders caused by high milk production, markedly affected embryo development in the postpartum period. Assisted reproductive techniques that allow the production and handling of extra numbers of generated embryos promise to have a very high impact on scientific and practical application. Any influence on the early embryonic life, both in animals and in vitro, is accompanied by a sensitive change in embryonic activity and should be assessed in vivo on the basis of physiological conditions before being used for ART.  aPublisher supplied data 3aembryo transfer 3aembryogenesis 3aendoscopy 3aenvironmental impact 3afallopian tubes 3agene expression 3agenome 3amethylation 3amilk production 3aovulation 3apostpartum period 3aprogesterone 0aembryo development 0aenvironment 0aoviduct 0ain vitro production1 aBrem, G.1 aHavlicek, V.0 tAnimal.g2020 Mar., v. 14, no.

In this study, a series of co-AD of different urban derived organic wastes (sewage sludge-SS, food waste-FW, yard waste-YW) were conducted in a semi-continuous mode, and the corresponding dynamic evolutions of microbial community structure were followed by using real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). As for co-AD of two feedstocks, introduction of SS (25%, VS basis) in FW significantly improved the process stability and archaea/total microbe ratio (from 0.4% to 17.1%), which might be due to the regulating effect of abundant trace metals in SS; co-AD of SS (25%, VS basis) with YW improved the methane yield by 2.04 times than AD of YW only together with higher methane contents (57.4 ± 1.3% vs. 50.9 ± 2.2%); in co-AD of FW and YW, synergistic effects in terms of increased methane production (3.4–19.1%) were observed, which was correlated with more robust growth of both bacteria and archaea. As for co-AD of three feedstocks, high methane yields of 314.9 ± 17.1 mL/g VS were achieved with a reliable stability. These findings could provide some fundamental and technical information for the co-treatment of urban derived organic wastes in centralized AD facilities.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArchaea 3aanaerobic digestion 3abacteria 3abiogas 3acommunity structure 3aenergy 3afeedstocks 3afood waste 3agas production (biological) 3amethane 3amethane production 3amicrobial communities 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3asewage 3asewage sludge 3asynergism 3atrace elements 3awaste management 3ayard wastes 0aYard waste 0aCo-digestion1 aZhang, Lei1 aZhu, Kongyun1 aMa, Jiao1 aIfran, Muhammad1 aLi, Aimin0 tScience of the total environment.g2020 Feb. 20, v. 704 p.135429-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.1354293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02319naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002200139245010600161520138900267592002801656650003001684650001101714650002801725650002201753650001001775650002301785700001901808773011901827856007401946852000902020655001202029IND60766979220221119073454.0220211e20220205xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076697922DNAL7 a10.3390/w140304732doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFlores, Rafael A.10aWater Benchmarking in Buildings: A Systematic Review on Methods and Benchmarks for Water Conservation  aWater conservation is essential to sustainable development, and among human activities, buildings are responsible for a significant portion of total water consumption. Therefore, we present a systematic review that aims to search for valuable contributions from benchmarking and their potential significance to water conservation. The relevance of performing such a review is to support the research in the field, organise information, and highlight both the lack of data and valuable results in specific building types. Benchmarking highlights best performance buildings, while it also classifies performances, which allows developing interventions for different buildings. Seventy-two documents on the environmental performance of buildings were reviewed, and a variety of methods, metering procedures, and indicators were found as valuable data for water-saving initiatives. In addition to a systematic search in SCOPUS, searches were made in Science Direct and Google Scholar databases. Although the main challenge in this matter lies in the lack of procedures standardisation, it was found that performing benchmarking is relevant for accurately developing water conservation initiatives. Gains of over five million m³ per year in a set of buildings or above 151 thousand m³ per year in a single factory were found, which indicate the existing potential for water conservation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aenvironmental performance 3ahumans 3asustainable development 3asystematic review 3awater 3awater conservation1 aGhisi, Enedir 0 tWater.g2022 Feb. 05, v. 14, no. 3dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21688x2073-44417nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w140304733Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03869naa a2200673 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100005400147245006700201300001800268500001900286520198500305592002802290650001202318650002002330650001402350650001602364650001902380650002002399650001202419650001402431650002102445650001802466650001402484650001202498650001502510650001202525650002102537650002802558650001202586650002302598650001602621650001502637650002602652650001202678650001402690650001502704653002402719653002002743653002502763653002502788700002002813700001402833700001702847700001302864700001602877700002202893700001502915700001602930700001602946700001602962773011502978856008103093852000903174655001203183IND60683243820221123040949.0200207e202003  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068324382DNAL7 a10.1017/S17517311190031612doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aClauss, M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3841-620710aReview: Comparative methane production in mammalian herbivores  ap. s113-s123.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aMethane (CH₄) production is a ubiquitous, apparently unavoidable side effect of fermentative fibre digestion by symbiotic microbiota in mammalian herbivores. Here, a data compilation is presented of in vivo CH₄ measurements in individuals of 37 mammalian herbivore species fed forage-only diets, from the literature and from hitherto unpublished measurements. In contrast to previous claims, absolute CH₄ emissions scaled linearly to DM intake, and CH₄ yields (per DM or gross energy intake) did not vary significantly with body mass. CH₄ physiology hence cannot be construed to represent an intrinsic ruminant or herbivore body size limitation. The dataset does not support traditional dichotomies of CH₄ emission intensity between ruminants and nonruminants, or between foregut and hindgut fermenters. Several rodent hindgut fermenters and nonruminant foregut fermenters emit CH₄ of a magnitude as high as ruminants of similar size, intake level, digesta retention or gut capacity. By contrast, equids, macropods (kangaroos) and rabbits produce few CH₄ and have low CH₄ : CO₂ ratios for their size, intake level, digesta retention or gut capacity, ruling out these factors as explanation for interspecific variation. These findings lead to the conclusion that still unidentified host-specific factors other than digesta retention characteristics, or the presence of rumination or a foregut, influence CH₄ production. Measurements of CH₄ yield per digested fibre indicate that the amount of CH₄ produced during fibre digestion varies not only across but also within species, possibly pointing towards variation in microbiota functionality. Recent findings on the genetic control of microbiome composition, including methanogens, raise the question about the benefits methanogens provide for many (but apparently not to the same extent for all) species, which possibly prevented the evolution of the hosting of low-methanogenic microbiota across mammals.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEquidae 3aadverse effects 3abody size 3abody weight 3acarbon dioxide 3adata collection 3adigesta 3adigestion 3aemissions factor 3aenergy intake 3aevolution 3aforegut 3aherbivores 3ahindgut 3ahost specificity 3ainterspecific variation 3amethane 3amethane production 3amethanogens 3amicrobiome 3amonogastric livestock 3arodents 3aruminants 3arumination 0amean retention time 0adigesta washing 0aforegut fermentation 0ahindgut fermentation1 aDittmann, M.

Analysis of the specific molecular changes associated with abscission is hampered by contamination from neighboring nonseparating tissues. Moreover, studies of abscission frequently involve the examination of events that take place in isolated segments of tissue exposed to nonphysiological concentrations of ethylene or indole-3-acetic acid for protracted periods (more than 24 h) of time. To resolve these problems, we have adopted the use of a transgenic line of Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) where the promoter of an abscission-specific polygalacturonase gene (At2g41850/ARABIDOPSIS DEHISCENCE ZONE POLYGALACTURONASE2) has been fused to a green fluorescent protein reporter. RNA was extracted from green fluorescent protein-tagged cells, released from abscising floral organs, and used to generate a complementary DNA library. This library was used to probe a microarray, and a population of abscission-related transcripts was studied in detail. Seven novel abscission-related genes were identified, four of which encode proteins of unknown function. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analyses and promoter fusions to the β-glucuronidase reporter gene confirmed the expression of these genes in the abscission zone and revealed other places of expression during seedling development. Three of these genes were studied further by crossing reporter lines to the abscission mutants inflorescence deficient in abscission (ida) and blade-on-petiole1 (bop1)/bop2 and an IDA-overexpressing line. Phenotypic analysis of an At3g14380 transfer DNA insertion line indicates that this gene plays a functional role in floral organ shedding. This strategy has enabled us to uncover new genes involved in abscission, and their possible contribution to the process is discussed.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3aRNA 3aabscission 3abeta-glucuronidase 3acDNA libraries 3acrossing 3adehiscence 3aethylene 3aflowers 3afluorescence 3agene overexpression 3agenetically modified organisms 3agreen fluorescent protein 3aindole acetic acid 3amicroarray technology 3amutants 3aphenotype 3apolygalacturonase 3areporter genes 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3aseedlings 3atissues 3atranscription (genetics) 3atransfer DNA1 aShahid, Ahmad Ali1 aZhang, Li1 aLiu, Yang1 aNinsuwan, Unchalee1 aRoberts, Jeremy Alan0 tPlant physiology.g2012 Nov., v. 160, no. 3 p.1342-1356dAmerican Society of Plant Biologistsx0032-08897nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1104/pp.112.2059553Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02700naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002000152245008800172520142900260592002801689650001301717650001201730650001101742650002001753650001301773650001301786650002101799650001601820651001601836653003601852653003301888653001801921653001601939653000801955700002101963700001801984700005902002700002302061773009802084856008702182852000902269655001202278IND60679032920221123030444.0210423e20200301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067903292DNAL7 a10.1016/j.geomorph.2019.1069862doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOien, Rachel P.10aClimatic controls on the equilibrium-line altitudes of Scandinavian cirque glaciers  aThe equilibrium-line altitudes (ELAs) of reconstructed palaeoglaciers have been widely used to assess palaeoclimatic conditions, yet this concept has rarely been tested using modern glaciers. To address this shortcoming, correlations between the ELAs of 513 modern cirque glaciers and present-day climatic and topographic variables across Scandinavia, as well as regional trends in ELA and climate, are analysed. ELAs are calculated using the Area-Altitude-Balance-Ratio method, with a ratio of 1.5 ± 0.4. Results indicate that glacier ELAs are strongly correlated with distance from the coast. This reflects the present-day precipitation pattern of the region (characterised by high precipitation near the sea) and demonstrates a climate dominated by a maritime-continental transition. Temperature explains differences in glacier ELA regional trends as well as ELA changes with latitude. Following standard meteorological convention, Scandinavia is divided into two macro-climate regions and analyses are run within the macro-regions as well as the complete dataset. The strength of correlations between ELA and precipitation increases when the study is divided into northern and southern macro-regions. These results test long held assumptions about relationships between climate and cirque glacier ELA, which is of particular relevance to palaeoclimatic studies based on the reconstruction of former cirque glaciers.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaltitude 3aclimate 3acoasts 3adata collection 3aglaciers 3alatitude 3apaleoclimatology 3atemperature 3aScandinavia 0aEquilibrium-line altitude (ELA) 0aScandinavian cirque glaciers 0aPrecipitation 0aTemperature 0aGIS1 aSpagnolo, Matteo1 aRea, Brice R.1 aBarr, Iestyn D.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9066-87381 aBingham, Robert G.0 tGeomorphology.g2020 Mar. 01, v. 352 p.106986-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12407x0169-555X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.geomorph.2019.1069863Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02321naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100005800147245011000205300001600315520117800331592002801509650003701537650001301574650001901587650001401606650001901620650001701639700005801656700005701714773014501771856008201916852000901998655001202007IND60593178020221118220138.0180619e201805  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059317802DNAL7 a10.1007/s00107-017-1279-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEhrhart, Thomas1http://orcid.org/0000-0001-9551-471412aA non-contact method for the determination of fibre direction of European beech wood (Fagus sylvatica L.)  ap. 925-935.  aThis paper introduces a non-contact method for the identification, quantification, and documentation of fibre direction of European beech wood (Fagus sylvatica L.). The developed approach is based on an automated visual analysis of the spindle pattern formed by the medullary rays, also termed wood rays. Each spindle is identified by means of image analysis technique, its position and orientation is determined, and the fibre direction of discretised elements is calculated. The individual process steps necessary to obtain an estimate of the fibre direction of a board are explained using the examples of five different failure types. In all examples, the estimated fields of fibre direction are congruent with the actual fibre direction determined by means of (1) the orientation of all present shrinkage cracks, which are established indicators for the fibre direction in wood, and (2) the fracture pattern after tensile testing. Employing the presented approach could open up new possibilities for the characterisation of European beech and other hardwood species with multi-row medullary rays in several fields of application, in particular regarding stress grading.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFagus sylvatica subsp. sylvatica 3ahardwood 3aimage analysis 3ashrinkage 3astress grading 3awood anatomy1 aSteiger, René,1http://orcid.org/0000-0002-0096-098X1 aFrangi, Andrea1http://orcid.org/0000-0002-2735-12600 tEuropean journal of wood and wood products.g2018 May, v. 76, no. 3 p.925-935dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl17107x0018-37687nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00107-017-1279-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02370naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001700155245015600172520109900328592002801427650001501455650001301470650003301483650001001516650001301526650001901539650002501558653003101583653004301614653001201657653000901669700001401678700001901692700001401711700001801725700001201743700001401755773009201769856009001861852000901951655001201960IND60737795520221120022228.0210619e202109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073779552DNAL7 a10.1016/j.compositesa.2021.1064762doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Haizhou10aSkin structured silver/three-dimensional graphene/polydimethylsiloxane composites with exceptional electromagnetic interference shielding effectiveness  aHigh performance skin structured Electromagnetic Interference (EMI) shielding composites has been fabricated. Namely, the Ag-coated reduced graphene oxide aerogel film (rGO-AF) and the graphene oxide foam (rGO-F) were combined to form three-dimensional (3D) graphene, which compounded with polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) matrix to prepare the lightweight flexible composites. Particularly, the distinct skin structure of the composites imparted it excellent EMI shielding performance and unique bidirectional differential performance. When electromagnetic waves (EMWs) run into the skin structured Ag/rGO-AF/rGO-F/PDMS composites along the direction of Ag side or rGO-F side, the total EMI shielding effectiveness (SEₜₒₜ) of the two cases at X band (8.2 ~ 12.4 GHz) reached 67.3 dB and 68.9 dB respectively, which hardly changed. Nevertheless, when the EMWs pass through the Ag side, the reflection EMI shielding effectiveness (SER) of the material increased. In contrast, when the EMWs passed through the rGO-F side, the overall absorption EMI shielding effectiveness (SEA) improved.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3aaerogels 3aelectromagnetic interference 3afoams 3agraphene 3agraphene oxide 3apolydimethylsiloxane 0aThree-dimensional Graphene 0aElectromagnetic Interference Shielding 0aAerogel 0aFoam1 aXu, Ying,1 aCao, Jian-Ping1 aHan, Dong1 aYang, Qiaowen1 aLi, Rui1 aZhao, Fei0 tComposites.g2021 Sept., v. 148 p.106476-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12034x1359-835X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.compositesa.2021.1064763Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02452naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100002300188245005700211300001600268506007600284520094300360592002801303506003701331650003101368650001801399650001401417650001301431650003401444650001101478650002001489650003101509650001601540650001801556650000901574650001601583650001401599650001701613700002301630700002201653700002101675700001801696700002101714700001801735773010301753856008101856852000901937655001201946IND60094237420221207140543.0141104e201306  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009423742DNAL7 a10.1016/j.mib.2013.05.0032doi7 aPMC37427172pmcid7 a237903982pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBradfute, Steven B10aAutophagy as an immune effector against tuberculosis  ap. 355-365.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe now well-accepted innate immunity paradigm that autophagy acts as a cell-autonomous defense against intracellular bacteria has its key origins in studies with Mycobacterium tuberculosis, an important human pathogen and a model microorganism infecting macrophages. A number of different factors have been identified that play into the anti-mycobacterial functions of autophagy, and recent in vivo studies in the mouse model of tuberculosis have uncovered additional anti-inflammatory and tissue-sparing functions of autophagy. Complementing these observations, genome wide association studies indicate a considerable overlap between autophagy, human susceptibility to mycobacterial infections and predisposition loci for inflammatory bowel disease. Finally, recent studies show that autophagy is an important regulator and effector of IL-1 responses, and that autophagy intersects with type I interferon pathology-modulating responses.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aMycobacterium tuberculosis 3aanimal models 3aautophagy 3abacteria 3agenome-wide association study 3ahumans 3ain vivo studies 3ainflammatory bowel disease 3ainterferons 3ainterleukin-1 3aloci 3amacrophages 3apathogens 3atuberculosis1 aCastillo, Eliseo F1 aArko-Mensah, John1 aChauhan, Santosh1 aJiang, Shanya1 aMandell, Michael1 aDeretic, Vojo0 tCurrent opinion in microbiology.g2013 June, v. 16, no. 3 p.355-365dElsevier Ltdx1369-52747nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.mib.2013.05.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02090naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100006100153245009700214500001900311520098400330592002801314650000801342650001901350650001201369650002101381650000901402650001301411651001001424653002901434653001901463653003701482700001701519773010701536856008801643852000901731655001201740IND60700908420221122213902.0200819e202009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070090842DNAL7 a10.1016/j.marpolbul.2020.1114222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMuhammad, Sulaman1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5619-784010aChina's seaborne oil import and shipping emissions: The prospect of belt and road initiative  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aChina's seaborne foreign oil supply through the Malacca Strait is facing security challenges due to territorial disputes, pirate attacks, and geopolitics. To overcome these challenges, China plans to import oil through one of the corridors of the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI)—the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC). This study estimated and compared ship emissions and their externalities associated with seaborne oil supply from the top five oil suppliers to China through the existing shipping route via the Malacca Strait and proposed route via CEPC. Ship activity-based methodology is applied to estimate the emissions of air pollutants (CO₂, NOₓ, SO₂, PM₁₀, and CO) during cruising, maneuvering, and hoteling periods. The results show that the total ship emissions of China's seaborne oil supply can be significantly reduced from 6.2 million tons to 2.1 million tons via the CPEC route. While external cost can be reduced up to 65.9% via the CPEC route.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3acarbon dioxide 3aimports 3amarine pollution 3aoils 3apolitics 3aChina 0aBelt and road initiative 0aShip emissions 0aChina-Pakistan economic corridor1 aLong, Xingle0 tMarine pollution bulletin.g2020 Sept., v. 158 p.111422-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12420x0025-326X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.marpolbul.2020.1114223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01703naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100001300142245011200155300001600267520061900283592002800902650002400930650001400954650002300968650001300991650001901004650002601023650001301049653002201062653001301084653001001097653002001107700001601127700001401143773008701157856007601244852000901320655001201329IND60481605420221119091213.0160208e20120904xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6048160542DNAL7 a10.1515/hf-2012-00742doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Peng10aFractal dimension analysis of void size in wood-strand composites based on X-ray computer tomography images  ap. 177-182.  aOriented strandboards were constructed from various combinations of mixed hardwood flakes.

Differences between environments, between stages of growth, and their interaction were significant for tiller number, leaf number, leaf area, specific leaf weight, shoot-to-root ratio, dry weight of leaf, shoot and root, and seedling dry weight. Both main effects and their interaction were highly significant for relative growth rate (RGR) and leaf area ratio (LAR), while for net assimilation rate (NAR) differences between environments were non-significant. Seedlings grown in high light and high temperature environments produced higher dry matter than those grown in low light or low temperature. The effect of irradiance was greater than that of temperature for most characters studied. Both RGR and NAR declined gradually with advancing plant age in all environments; LAR declined only in high light environments. Simple correlation coefficients revealed that increasing RGR and LAR could be accompanied by increasing tiller number, leaf number, leaf area, seedling dry weight and shoot-to-root ratio. Highly significant correlations were obtained between RGR and LAR (0.69 to 0.93 at 0.001 level), whereas there was no correlation between RGR and NAR. It is apparent that variation among environments in dry matter production of bromegrass seedlings was attributed to differences in LAR rather than NAR. Specific leaf weight was negatively correlated with RGR at the 0.001 level (−0.90) and LAR (−0.97), but positively correlated with NAR at the 0.05 level (0.47).  aPublisher supplied data 3aBromus inermis 3adry matter accumulation 3aleaf area 3aleaves 3alight intensity 3anet assimilation rate 3aplant age 3aseedling growth 3aseedlings 3aspecific leaf weight 3atemperature1 aTan, Wai-Koon1 aWalton, P.

Mitotic arrest is essential for the normal differentiation of male germ cells into spermatogonia and accompanies epigenetic reprogramming and meiosis inhibition from embryonic development to post-hatch. However, mitotic arrest was not well studied in chickens because of the difficulty in obtaining pure germ cells from relevant developmental stage. RESULTS: We performed single-cell RNA sequencing to investigate transcriptional dynamics of male germ cells during mitotic arrest in DAZL::GFP chickens. Using differentially expressed gene analysis and K-means clustering to analyze cells at different developmental stages (E12, E16, and hatch), we found that metabolic and signaling pathways were regulated, and that the epigenome was reprogrammed during mitotic arrest. In particular, we found that histone H3K9 and H3K14 acetylation (by HDAC2) and DNA demethylation (by DNMT3B and HELLS) led to a transcriptionally permissive chromatin state. Furthermore, we found that global DNA demethylation occurred gradually after the onset of mitotic arrest, indicating that the epigenetic-reprogramming schedule of the chicken genome differs from that of the mammalian genome. DNA hypomethylation persisted after hatching, and methylation was slowly re-established 3 weeks later. CONCLUSIONS: We found a unique epigenetic-reprogramming schedule of mitotic-arrested chicken prospermatogonia and prolonged hypomethylation after hatching. This will provide a foundation for understanding the process of germ-cell epigenetic regulation in several species for which this process is not clearly described. Our findings on the biological processes related to sex-specific differentiation of prospermatogonia could help studying germline development in vitro more elaborately.  aPublisher supplied data  a2015R1A3A2033826cNational Research Foundation of Korea 3aDNA demethylation 3aDNA hypomethylation 3aRNA 3aacetylation 3abiotechnology 3achickens 3achromatin 3aembryogenesis 3aepigenetics 3aepigenome 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3ahistones 3amales 3amammals 3ameiosis 3amitosis 3aspermatogonia 3atranscription (genetics)1 aJung, Kyung Min1 aRengaraj, Deivendran1 aLee, Kyung Youn1 aYoo, Eunhui1 aKim, Tae Hyun1 aHan, Jae Yong1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3413-32770 tJournal of animal science and biotechnology.g2022 Dec., v. 13, no. 1 p.64-64dBioMed CentralwJournal:2268x2049-18917nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s40104-022-00712-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02740naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001800139245012900157520170600286592002801992650003102020650001102051650001202062650002202074650000902096650001102105650001002116651001602126700001802142700002002160700002002180773011902200856007402319852000902393655001202402IND60766979820221119073551.0220211e20220206xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076697982DNAL7 a10.3390/w140304782doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKim, Hanbeen 10aImprovement of Extreme Value Modeling for Extreme Rainfall Using Large-Scale Climate Modes and Considering Model Uncertainty  aExtreme value modeling for extreme rainfall is one of the most important processes in the field of hydrology. For the improvement of extreme value modeling and its physical meaning, large-scale climate modes have been widely used as covariates of distribution parameters, as they can physically account for climate variability. This study proposes a novel procedure for extreme value modeling of rainfall based on the significant relationship between the long-term trend of the annual maximum (AM) daily rainfall and large-scale climate indices. This procedure is characterized by two main steps: (a) identifying significant seasonal climate indices (SCIs), which impact the long-term trend of AM daily rainfall using statistical approaches, such as ensemble empirical mode decomposition, and (b) selecting an appropriate generalized extreme value (GEV) distribution among the stationary GEV and nonstationary GEV (NS-GEV) using time and SCIs as covariates by comparing their model fit and uncertainty. Our findings showed significant relationships between the long-term trend of AM daily rainfall over South Korea and SCIs (i.e., the Atlantic Meridional Mode, Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation in the fall season, and North Atlantic Oscillation in the summer season). In addition, we proposed a model selection procedure considering both the Akaike information criterion and residual bootstrap method to select an appropriate GEV distribution among a total of 59 GEV candidates. As a result, the NS-GEV with SCI covariates generally showed the best performance over South Korea. We expect that this study can contribute to estimating more reliable extreme rainfall quantiles using climate covariates.  aPublisher supplied data 3aNorth Atlantic Oscillation 3aautumn 3aclimate 3amodel uncertainty 3arain 3asummer 3awater 3aSouth Korea1 aKim, Taereem 1 aShin, Ju-Young 1 aHeo, Jun-Haeng 0 tWater.g2022 Feb. 06, v. 14, no. 3dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21688x2073-44417nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w140304783Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02094naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001500139245005500154300001600209520106900225592002801294650000801322650002201330650001601352650002401368650001501392650001801407650002101425650001301446650000901459650001401468700001801482700001701500773013201517856007401649852000901723655001201732IND60765168720221119100118.0220422e20111222xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076516872DNAL7 a10.17221/4398-pse2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFajkus, J.10aAnalysis of chromosome termini in potato varieties  ap. 477-479.  a&nbsp;Chromosomes of potato (Solanum tuberosum) are terminated by telomeres, which are formed by tandemly repeated [TTTAGGG]n oligonucleotide sequence. The total length of blocks of telomeric DNA has been known to vary largely among plant species and their varieties, and also among individual chromosome arms within a&nbsp;single nucleus. To check for such differences in potato varieties, which could be of a&nbsp;possible use in genotyping, we performed pulsed-field gel electrophoretic analysis of terminal restriction fragments in selected potato varieties. We found a&nbsp;typical range of telomere lengths of 20&ndash;60 kb in most analysed varieties. In one of analysed varieties (Monalisa), telomeres of wider span (up to 80 kb) have been observed. Most of restriction enzymes (PvuII, HaeIII, TaqI) produced a&nbsp;resulting smeared hybridisation pattern of telomeres. When using BglII, however, a&nbsp;doublet hybridisation band could be observed. This may reflect differences in composition of telomere-associated sequences at different chromosome ends.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aSolanum tuberosum 3aenvironment 3agel electrophoresis 3agenotyping 3ahybridization 3aoligonucleotides 3apotatoes 3asoil 3atelomeres1 aNovotná, M.,1 aPtáček, J.0 tPlant, Soil and Environment.g, v. 48, no. 11 p.477-479dCzech Academy of Agricultural ScienceswJournal:17122x1214-11787nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.17221/4398-pse3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02822naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002700111040001800138100002100156245018500177300001800362500002400380520105600404650002001460650002001480650002101500650001601521650002401537650001301561650001301574650000901587650001401596650001201610650002301622650001201645650001401657650003201671650002501703650005201728650000901780650003301789650003301822650000901855650002501864650002801889650003301917650003701950700001601987700002202003700002002025700001802045773010702063852000902170856007702179655001202256IND4462031520221119230217.0111014s2011    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446203152DNAL7 a218098862pmid7 a10.1021/jf200988f2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNakajima, Shingo10aPotato Extract (Potein) Suppresses Food Intake in Rats through Inhibition of Luminal Trypsin Activity and Direct Stimulation of Cholecystokinin Secretion from Enteroendocrine Cells  ap. 9491-9496.  aIncludes references  aDietary proteins and trypsin inhibitors are known to stimulate the secretion of the satiety hormone cholecystokinin (CCK). A potato extract (Potein) contains 60% carbohydrate and 20% protein including trypsin inhibitory proteins. In this study, we examined whether Potein suppresses food intake in rats and whether it directly stimulates CCK secretion in enteroendocrine cells. In fasted rats, food consumption was measured up to 6 h after the oral administration of Potein or soybean trypsin inhibitor (SBTI). CCK-releasing activities of Potein and SBTI were examined in the murine CCK-producing cell line STC-1. Potein inhibited the trypsin activity in vitro with a potency 20-fold lower than that of SBTI. Oral administration of Potein dose-dependently suppressed food intake for 1-6 h. Potein, but not the SBTI, dose-dependently induced CCK secretion in STC-1 cells. These results suggest that Potein suppresses food intake through the CCK secretion induced by direct stimulation on enteroendocrine cells and through inhibition of luminal trypsin. 3acholecystokinin 3adietary protein 3afood consumption 3afood intake 3aoral administration 3apotatoes 3aproteins 3arats 3asecretion 3atrypsin 3atrypsin inhibitors 2aAnimals 2aCell Line 2aCholecystokininxsecretion. 2aEatingxdrug effects 2aEnteroendocrine Cellsxdrug effectsxsecretion. 2aMale 2aPlant Extractsxpharmacology 2aPlant Proteinsxpharmacology 2aRats 2aRats, Sprague-Dawley 2aSatiationxdrug effects 2aSolanum tuberosumxchemistry 2aTrypsin Inhibitorsxpharmacology1 aHira, Tohru1 aTsubata, Masahito1 aTakagaki, Kinya1 aHara, Hiroshi0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2011 Sept. 14, v. 59, no. 17 p.9491-9496x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf200988f3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle01901naa a2200313 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002000110245013900130300001800269520095400287650001801241650002001259650002401279650001801303650002001321650001401341650002601355650002001381700001601401773009201417852000901509930003301518945001301551946001101564655001201575IND2063302520221119230515.0980422e199706  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND206330252DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBaydoun, E.A.H.10aDistribution of xylosyltransferases and glucuronyltransferase within the Golgi apparatus in etiolated pea (Pisum sativum L.) epicotyls  ap. 1209-1214.  aMembranes from etiolated pea epicotyls were fractionated by discontinuous sucrose-density-gradient centrifugation into endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi apparatus and plasma membrane.

The glucuronyltransferase was concentrated in the low-density Golgi membranes, but xylosyltransferases were found in all three Golgi subfractions. The multiple location of xylosyltransferases within the Golgi was found in both younger and older regions of the epicotyl, and xylan was the major product of the xylosyltransferase in the low- and medium-density subfractions.

The absence of cell wall or plasma membrane labelling by TOP 35 indicates a distinct biosynthetic pathway of this protein to the vacuolar membrane in plants. 3aLepidium sativum 3atonoplast 3aplant proteins 3aglycoproteins 3aimmunocytochemistry 3aroots 3amonoclonal antibodies1 aPolsakiewicz, M.1 aHartmann, I.1 aPeters, P.1 aVolkmann, D.1 aScherer, G.F.E.0 tJournal of experimental botany.g1997 June, v. 48, no. 311 p.1215-1221x0022-09577nnas  aDNAL  a19980531b19980605c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US 7aarticle03409naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100002100171245018000192300001800372500002400390520169500414650004302109650001902152650001702171650001402188650002002202650002202222650002702244650001302271650001902284650002302303650001202326650005202338650002102390650001202411650002702423650002002450650002302470650002202493650002502515650001402540650003302554650002702587650002402614651001802638700002202656700002102678773010402699852000902803856005502812655001202867IND4460361320221119230546.0110722e201108  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446036132DNAL7 a216891902pmid7 a10.1111/j.1365-294X.2011.05159.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIrwin, Darren E.10aGenetic variation and seasonal migratory connectivity in Wilson's warblers (Wilsonia pusilla): species-level differences in nuclear DNA between western and eastern populations  ap. 3102-3115.  aIncludes references  aThere is growing interest in understanding patterns of seasonal migratory connectivity between breeding and wintering sites, both because differences in migratory behaviour can be associated with population differentiation and because knowledge of migratory connectivity is essential for understanding the ecology, evolution and conservation of migratory species. We present the first broad survey of geographic variation in the nuclear genome of breeding and wintering Wilson's warblers (Wilsonia pusilla), which have previously served as a research system for the study of whether genetic markers and isotopes can reveal patterns of migratory connectivity. Using 153 samples surveyed at up to 257 variable amplified fragment length polymorphism markers, we show that Wilson's warblers consist of highly distinct western and eastern breeding groups, with all winter samples grouping with the western breeding group. Within the west, there is weak geographic differentiation, at a level insufficient for use in the assignment of wintering samples to specific areas. The distinctiveness of western and eastern genetic groups, with no known intermediates, strongly suggests that these two groups are cryptic species. Analysis of mitochondrial cytochrome b sequence variation shows that the estimated coalescence time between western and eastern clades is approximately 2.3 Ma, a surprisingly old time of divergence that is more typical of distinct species than of subspecies. Given their morphological similarity but strong genetic differences, western and eastern Wilson's warblers present a likely case of association between divergence in migratory behaviour and the process of speciation. 3aamplified fragment length polymorphism 3abreeding sites 3acytochrome b 3aevolution 3agenetic markers 3agenetic variation 3ageographical variation 3aisotopes 3anuclear genome 3aseasonal variation 3asurveys 2aAmplified Fragment Length Polymorphism Analysis 2aAnimal Migration 2aAnimals 2aCell Nucleusxgenetics 2aGenetic Markers 2aGenetic Speciation 2aGenetic Variation 2aGenetics, Population 2aGeography 2aPrincipal Component Analysis 2aSequence Analysis, DNA 2aSongbirdsxgenetics 0aNorth America1 aIrwin, Jessica H.1 aSmith, Thomas B.0 tMolecular ecology.g2011 Aug., v. 20, no. 15 p.3102-3115dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0962-10837nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-294X.2011.05159.x 7aarticle03405naa a2200625 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002700111040001800138100002400156245014200180300001800322500002400340520152600364650002001890650001301910650001901923650001301942650001601955650002101971650001101992650001402003650001702017650001602034650001602050650004302066650001102109650001302120650001602133650001402149650001002163650001502173650001002188650002702198650002402225650002802249650004102277650001102318650004002329650002102369650001102390650000902401650003702410650004802447650001002495700002602505700002502531700001802556773010702574852000902681856007702690655001202767IND4462031920221119230619.0111014s2011    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446203192DNAL7 a218124812pmid7 a10.1021/jf20150392doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStalmach, Angelique10aIdentification of (Poly)phenolic Compounds in Concord Grape Juice and Their Metabolites in Human Plasma and Urine after Juice Consumption  ap. 9512-9522.  aIncludes references  aAnalysis of Concord grape juice by HPLC with ESI-MSn, PDA, and fluorescence detection resulted in the identification and quantification of 60 flavonoids and related phenolic compounds, which were present at an overall concentration of 1508 +/- 31 μmol/L. A total of 25 anthocyanins were detected, which were mono- and di-O-glucosides, O-acetylglucosides, O-p-coumaroyl-O-diglucosides, and O-p-coumaroylglucosides of delphinidin, cyanidin, petunidin, peonidin, and malvidin. The anthocyanins represented 46% of the total phenolic content of the juice (680 μmol/L). Tartaric esters of hydroxycinnamic acids, namely, trans-caftaric and trans-coutaric acids, and to a lesser extent trans-fertaric acid accounted for 29% of the phenolic content, with a total concentration of 444 μmol/L, of which 85% comprised trans-caftaric acid. Free hydroxycinnamic acids were also quantified but contributed to <1% of the total phenolic content (8.4 μmol/L). The other groups of polyphenolic compounds present in the juice, accounting for 24% of the total, comprised monomeric and oligomeric units of (epi)catechin and (epi)gallocatechin (248 μmol/L), flavonols (76 μmol/L), gallic acid (51 μmol/L), and trans-resveratrol (1.5 μmol/L). The bioavailability of the (poly)phenolic compounds in 350 mL of juice was investigated following acute intake by healthy volunteers. Plasma and urine were collected over 0-24 h and analyzed for parent compounds and metabolites. In total, 41 compounds, principally metabolites, were identified. 3abioavailability 3acatechin 3acoumaric acids 3acyanidin 3adelphinidin 3aepigallocatechin 3aesters 3aflavonols 3afluorescence 3agallic acid 3agrape juice 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3ahumans 3amalvidin 3ametabolites 3apetunidin 3aurine 3avolunteers 2aAdult 2aAnthocyaninsxanalysis 2aBeveragesxanalysis 2aBiological Availability 2aChromatography, High Pressure Liquid 2aFemale 2aFlavonoidsxanalysisxbloodxurine. 2aFruitxchemistry 2aHumans 2aMale 2aPhenolsxanalysisxbloodxurine. 2aSpectrometry, Mass, Electrospray Ionization 2aVitis1 aEdwards, Christine A.1 aWightman, JoLynne D.1 aCrozier, Alan0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2011 Sept. 14, v. 59, no. 17 p.9512-9522x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf20150393Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03291naa a2200661 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092040001800130072000900148072000900157072000900166100001600175245015800191300001400349500002400363520146500387650001001852650002201862650002501884650000801909650001601917650001701933650001001950650001301960650001501973650001701988650001102005650002102016650000702037650002802044650001002072650001902082650002602101651001102127651001302138651001002151700002402161700001402185700001702199700001602216700001202232700001402244700001402258700001802272700001602290700001502306700001702321700002702338773008602365852000902451856008802460930003302548945002502581946001102606655001202617IND4432940120221119230320.0100220e201003  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443294012DNAL7 a10.1016/j.livsci.2009.10.0152doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL200 0aL100 0aQ5021 aŠkrlep, M.10aAssociation of PRKAG3 and CAST genetic polymorphisms with traits of interest in dry-cured ham production: Comparative study in France, Slovenia and Spain  ap. 60-66.  aIncludes references  aTwo genes (PRKAG3 and CAST) were screened for genotype incidence and their effect on green ham traits in pigs suitable for dry-cured ham production from three commercial crosses (in three countries France, Slovenia and Spain). Hams were genotyped for PRKAG3 Ile199Val, CAST Lys249Arg and CAST Ser638Arg polymorphisms and the traits of interest (green ham weight and fat thickness, pH in M. semimembranosus (SM), M. gluteus medius (GM) colour) were measured. The genotype frequencies as well as the effect of the studied genes varied according to the country, which used different genetic crosses and selection criteria for dry-cured ham processes. Regarding the association with traits of interest, we observed a significant effect of PRKAG3 Ile199Val polymorphism on green ham weight and colour grade in the French cross, on green ham fat thickness, colour grade and GM Minolta L⁎ and a⁎ values in the Slovenian cross, and on SM pH in the Spanish cross. The CAST Lys249Arg polymorphism affected green ham weight in Slovenian cross, whereas CAST Ser638Arg affected green ham colour grade in French cross. No effect of CAST polymorphisms on the traits of interest was found in Spanish cross. According to our results, PRKAG3 gene seems to be more influential on green ham traits important for dry ham production than CAST gene. However the results were different for each country, indicating possible interaction with other genetic or environmental factors. 3aswine 3agenetic variation 3agenetic polymorphism 3aham 3acured meats 3ameat quality 3agenes 3agenotype 3acrossbreds 3aswine breeds 3aweight 3asubcutaneous fat 3apH 3acarcass characteristics 3acolor 3agene frequency 3aenvironmental factors 3aFrance 3aSlovenia 3aSpain1 aČandek-Potokar, M.1 aKavar, T.1 aŽlender, B.1 aHortós, M.1 aGou, P.1 aArnau, J.1 aEvans, G.1 aSouthwood, O.1 aDiestre, A.1 aRobert, N.1 aDutertre, C.1 aSanté-Lhoutellier, V.0 tLivestock science.g2010 Mar., v. 128, no. 1-3 p.60-66dElsevierx1871-14137nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.livsci.2009.10.0153Available from publisher's Web site  a20100428b20100501c00000000  aINDd2CTe2010/04/07  aNon-US 7aarticle03956naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092040001800130072000900148072000900157100001700166245014100183300001600324500002400340520242300364650001502787650001602802650001302818650002102831650003202852650001102884650002302895650001502918650002102933650002002954650002002974650002702994650002303021650002303044650002803067650001503095650002003110650002303130700001603153700001503169773008803184852000903272856008803281930003303369945002503402946001103427655001203438IND4432938820221119230352.0100220e201003  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443293882DNAL7 a10.1016/j.livsci.2009.12.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL500 0aQ5021 aCalamari, L.10aEffects of either sodium selenite or Se yeast (Sc CNCM I-3060) supplementation on selenium status and milk characteristics in dairy cows  ap. 154-165.  aIncludes references  aThis study aimed to determine the effects of either dietary Se source or dose on dairy cow Se status, milk yield and subsequent milk characteristics. Forty lactating cows, offered the same basal diet, were blocked by DIM, milk yield and parity and then randomly allocated to 1 of 5 dietary treatments: negative control (CTRL; 0.098mg of Se kg⁻¹ DM), 2 Se yeast supplementation (SY03 and SY05, containing 0.31 and 0.50mg of total Se kg⁻¹ DM, respectively), and 2 sodium selenite supplementation (SS03 and SS05, containing 0.31 and 0.50mg of total Se kg⁻¹ DM, respectively). During the trial (lasted 140d), whole blood, plasma, and milk were analyzed for total Se, and whole blood for glutathione peroxidase activity. The proportion of total Se as selenomethionine (SeMet) or selenocysteine (SeCys) in whole blood and milk samples was also determined. Milk constituent, SCC, technological properties and keeping quality were measured on milk samples. Neither source nor dose was seen to affect milk yield, SCC, or milk characteristics. Glutathione peroxidase activity was greater (P <0.001) in Se supplemented cows than CTRL but no effect of source was observed. Total Se in whole blood, plasma and milk was greater (P <0.001) in Se yeast than selenite, with higher asymptotic values in Se yeast, and also a greater ratio between Se in milk and Se in blood or plasma (P <0.001). The time to asymptotic value of total Se in blood and milk was not affected by Se source, although time to asymptotic total Se in plasma was greater in Se yeast than selenite (P <0.05). The 16.3% of supplemental Se was transferred into milk of SY05 animals whereas only 3.2% in SS05 supplemented animals. In blood SeCys was the main form of Se, and SeMet the main Se form in milk. In blood and in milk SeMet increased only in those animals supplemented with Se yeast, and at the end of the supplementation period values were greater in Se yeast animals than selenite (P <0.001). These results demonstrate greater levels of Se in the blood and plasma of cows provided Se yeast compared with cows provided selenite, and a greater efficiency of transfer of Se from blood into milk resulting in a greater increase in milk Se concentration. Selenium source affected the proportion of total Se comprised as SeMet and SeCys in blood and milk, indicating further that different Se sources are metabolized by distinctly different mechanisms. 3adairy cows 3acow feeding 3aselenium 3adietary minerals 3adietary mineral supplements 3adosage 3anutritional status 3amilk yield 3amilk composition 3anutrient intake 3ablood chemistry 3aglutathione peroxidase 3aseleno amino acids 3asomatic cell count 3afood processing quality 3ashelf life 3anutritive value 3amineral metabolism1 aPetrera, F.1 aBertin, G.0 tLivestock science.g2010 Mar., v. 128, no. 1-3 p.154-165dElsevierx1871-14137nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.livsci.2009.12.0053Available from publisher's Web site  a20100428b20100501c00000000  aINDd2CTe2010/04/07  aNon-US 7aarticle02427naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092040001800130072000900148072000900157072000900166072000900175100001300184245013600197300001600333500002400349500001500373520092700388650001501315650002301330650002101353650001201374650001401386650002201400650002001422650001501442650002301457651001001480653002901490653001501519653002701534653001501561653001701576700001201593700001901605700001901624773008801643852000901731856008801740930003301828945002501861946001101886655001201897IND4432939220140725000000.0100220e201003  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443293922DNAL7 a10.1016/j.livsci.2009.10.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL830 0aL100 0aL210 0aL6001 aFouz, R.10aStatistical evaluation of somatic cell counts in bovine milk at calving, during lactation and at drying-off (by official recording)  ap. 185-188.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aA survey was carried out to evaluate the importance of postpartum intra-mammary infections (IMI), on the basis of somatic cell count (SCC), by characterising the behaviour of Linear Score (LS) in cows at calving, during lactation and at drying-off. Throughout 2007, a follow-up was made of 25,216 Friesian cow lactations from 1984 farms within Galician Official Milk Recording (Northwest Spain) selected by simple random sampling. SCC values were calculated from milk taken at each of the monthly tests performed on every sampled animal. Data indicated that the number of observations where LS was higher than 4 (LS>4) as well as the mean LS during lactation and the LS at drying-off significantly increased when LS at the beginning of lactation was greater than 4. Likewise, this study showed that the probability of an animal drying-off with LS>4 was significantly higher when the LS increased at the start of lactation. 3adairy cows 3atemporal variation 3amilk composition 3acalving 3alactation 3apostpartum period 3abovine mastitis 3amilk yield 3asomatic cell count 3aSpain 0aintra-mammary infections 0adrying off 0amammary gland diseases 0adry period 0aLinear Score1 aYus, E.1 aSanjuán, M.L.1 aDiéguez, F.J.0 tLivestock science.g2010 Mar., v. 128, no. 1-3 p.185-188dElsevierx1871-14137nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.livsci.2009.10.0103Available from publisher's Web site  a20100429b20100501c00000000  aINDd2CTe2010/04/07  aNon-US 7aarticle02847naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100003200164245008100196300001600277500002400293520118600317650002501503650001001528650002701538650002101565650000901586650002401595650001801619650004701637650002601684650002501710650002001735650001701755650002801772650002101800650002101821650001401842650004101856650003001897650002101927650005201948650003402000650003302034700001802067700001902085700002002104700001702124773010702141852000902248856004802257655001202305IND4401576420221119230435.0080217e200803  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440157642DNAL7 a181934572pmid7 a10.1007/s00438-007-0312-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aThirumurugan, Thiruvengadam10aIdentification, characterization and interaction of HAP family genes in rice  ap. 279-289.  aIncludes references  aA HAP complex, which consists of three subunits, namely HAP2 (also called NF-YA or CBF-B), HAP3 (NF-YB/CBF-A) and HAP5 (NF-YC/CBF-C), binds to CCAAT sequences in a promoter to control the expression of target genes. We identified 10 HAP2 genes, 11 HAP3 genes and 7 HAP5 genes in the rice genome. All the three HAP family genes encode a protein with a conserved domain in each family and various non-conserved regions in both length and amino acid sequence. These genes showed various expression patterns depending on genes, and various combinations of overlapped expression of the HAP2, HAP3 and HAP5 genes were observed. Furthermore, protein interaction analyses showed interaction of OsHAP3A, a ubiquitously expressed HAP3 subunit of rice, with specific members of HAP5. These results indicate that the formation of specific complex with various HAP subunits combinations can be achieved by both tissue specific expression of three subunit genes and specific interaction of three subunit proteins. This may suggest that the HAP complexes may control various aspects of rice growth and development through tissue specific expression and complex formation of three subunit members. 3aamino acid sequences 3agenes 3agrowth and development 3apromoter regions 3arice 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aBase Sequence 2aCCAAT-Binding Factorxchemistryxgenetics. 2aDNA Primersxgenetics 2aDNA, Plantxgenetics 2aGene Expression 2aGenes, Plant 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aMultigene Family 2aOryzaxgenetics. 2aPhylogeny 2aPlant Proteinsxchemistryxgenetics. 2aPromoter Regions, Genetic 2aProtein Subunits 2aReverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction 2aSequence Homology, Amino Acid 2aTwo-Hybrid System Techniques1 aIto, Yukihiro1 aKubo, Takahiko1 aSerizawa, Akiko1 aKurata, Nori0 tMolecular genetics and genomics.g2008 Mar., v. 279, no. 3 p.279-289dSpringer-Verlagx1617-46157nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00438-007-0312-3 7aarticle02988naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001500128245011000143300001600253500001500269520150800284650001101792650002301803650001001826650001601836650001501852650001001867650002001877650001001897650001101907650001601918650002001934650002801954650001501982650001101997650002602008650001102034650001302045650001802058650001202076651001402088651001402102653002102116653001702137653001802154653002402172700001402196700001802210700002002228773009602248852000902344930003302353945001302386946001102399655001202410IND2180514620221119230540.0981015e199802  uk |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND218051462DNAL7 a95051592pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aUntoro, J.14aThe association between BMI and haemoglobin and work productivity among Indonesian female factory workers  ap. 131-135.  a2019-12-05  aObjective: To investigate the relationship between body mass index (BMI), haemoglobin (Hb) concentration and work productivity in Indonesian female industrial workers engaged in cigarette rolling. Design: Randomized-stratified, cross-sectional study. Setting: A clove cigarette factory in Central Java Province, Indonesia. Subjects: Two-hundred and thirty female cigarette-rollers. Methods: Anthropometric variables (height, weight, mid-upper arm circumference, BMI), body composition (lean body mass and fat mass from skinfolds thicknesses), Hb, work productivity (cigarettes/hour) were determined. Results: Of the 230 selected subjects 40.4% were anaemic and 41.3% had BMI < 18.5. Average production was 620 +/- 86 cigarettes/h. Productivity was positively correlated with work experience (r = 0.214, P < 0.01), lean body mass (r = 0.183, P < 0.01), height (r = 0.150, P < 0.05), Hb (r = 0.141, P < 0.05), and arm muscle area (r = 0.120, P < 0.05). Anaemic subjects produced 4.9% less (P < 0.01) than the non-anaemic ones. No linear relationship existed between BMI and productivity, but subjects with a BMI < 18.5, or < 17.0, produced respectively 5.1% (P < 0.05) and 6.8% (P < 0.05) less than subjects with BMI between 18.5-22.5. Conclusions: Work productivity of persons with low BMI and Hb may be reduced. However, BMI was not a good screening tool to detect low producers. When using BMI < 18.5 and a production < 550 cigarettes/h as cut-offs sensitivity (64.7%) and specificity (55.5%) were low. 3aanemia 3anutritional status 3awomen 3abody weight 3ahemoglobin 3alabor 3abody mass index 2aAdult 2aAnemia 2aBody Height 2aBody Mass Index 2aCross-Sectional Studies 2aEfficiency 2aFemale 2aHemoglobinsxanalysis 2aHumans 2aIndustry 2aPlants, Toxic 2aTobacco 3aIndonesia 0aIndonesia 0aanemia (disease) 0aproductivity 0awomen workers 0aheight-weight ratio1 aGross, R.1 aSchultink, W.1 aSediaoetama, D.0 tEuropean journal of clinical nutrition.g1998 Feb., v. 52, no. 2 p.131-135x0954-30077nnas  aDNAL  a19981201b19981208c00000000  aINDdLDP  aNon-US 7aarticle03088naa a2200625 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092040001800130072000900148072000900157072000900166072000900175100001800184245013400202300001600336500002400352500001500376520129500391650002601686650002301712650001601735650002101751650001601772650002101788650002001809650001201829650002401841650001701865650002101882650001601903650002301919650001301942650000901955650001901964650001701983650002302000653003202023653001502055653002102070700001902091700001602110700001602126700001802142700001902160700001702179773008802196852000902284856008802293930003302381945002502414946001102439655001202450IND4432939520221119230515.0100220e201003  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443293952DNAL7 a10.1016/j.livsci.2009.11.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL100 0aL200 0aQ501 0aL6001 aLiu, Guanglei10aCanonical correlation of milk immunoglobulins, lactoferrin concentration and Dairy Herd Improvement data of Chinese Holstein cows  ap. 197-200.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aIn this study, canonical correlation analysis was applied to estimate the relationships of DHI data with milk Ig (IgG1, IgA, and IgM) and Lf concentrations. Specifically, we evaluated the relationships between two groups of variables: milk IgG1, IgA, IgM and Lf concentration as variables (y) and lactation number, stage of lactation, daily milk production, milk fat, protein, lactose, milk total solids and somatic cell score (SCS) as variables (x). The results indicated that four canonical variables were identified. The canonical correlations of the first and second pairs of canonical variables were 0.662 and 0.469 respectively, which were highly significant and accounted for 91.6% of the variability observed in the data. Stage of lactation, daily milk production, milk protein and SCS were the significant factors affecting milk Lf concentration in both canonical correlations and multiple correlation analysis, and lactation number was the significant factors affecting milk IgG1 concentration. The first standardized canonical variation combination could be regarded as a predictable measure of Lf concentration and the second as a predictor of IgG1 level. These results indicated that dairy producers could select cows for increased Ig and Lf production using DHI data directly. 3aparity (reproduction) 3amilk protein yield 3adairy herds 3aimmunoglobulin G 3acorrelation 3aimmunoglobulin M 3alactation stage 3alactose 3agenetic improvement 3adairy cattle 3aimmunoglobulin A 3alactoferrin 3aselection criteria 3aHolstein 3acows 3amilk fat yield 3atotal solids 3asomatic cell count 0aDairy Herd Improvement data 0amilk yield 0amilk composition1 aZhang, Chunlin1 aWang, Jiaqi1 aBu, Dengpan1 aZhou, Lingyun1 aZhao, Shengguo1 aLi, Shanshan0 tLivestock science.g2010 Mar., v. 128, no. 1-3 p.197-200dElsevierx1871-14137nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.livsci.2009.11.0103Available from publisher's Web site  a20100428b20100501c00000000  aINDd2CTe2010/04/07  aNon-US 7aarticle01977naa a2200265 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001700145245007800162300001800240500002400258520113300282650001201415650001601427650000901443650002001452700002101472773011201493852000901605856008501614655001201699IND4420922920221119230507.0090522s2009    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442092292DNAL7 a10.1007/s00265-009-0774-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBrandt, Yoni10aDo the elongated eye stalks of Diopsid flies facilitate rival assessment?  ap. 1243-1246.  aIncludes references  aThe elongated eye span of male Diopsid flies is a sexually selected character that scales positively with body size. Previously, the duration of agonistic contests was found to increase as rival body size and eye span disparities decreased. Hence, along with its role in mate choice, eye span seems to facilitate mutual assessment of rival size. However, such results are also expected in the absence of rival assessment, when each individual persists according to its own size-dependent internal threshold. Here, we reanalyze these contests to distinguish between these two hypotheses using two measures of size: body length and eye span. Mutual assessment predicts that contest duration should increase with loser size and decrease with winner size. In contrast, our results were more consistent with self-assessment: We found a positive relationship between loser size and contest duration, whereas winner size did not affect contest duration. Thus, flies did not appear to assess the size of their rivals, indicating that the mutual assessment function of eye span elongation may be less important than previously suspected. 3aDiptera 3abody length 3aeyes 3amating behavior1 aSwallow, John G.0 tBehavioral ecology and sociobiology.g2009 June, v. 63, no. 8 p.1243-1246dSpringer-Verlagx0340-54437nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00265-009-0774-x3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02803naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001900145245007500164300001800239500002400257520161800281650001801899650002501917650001001942650001201952650003201964651001001996651001202006700002402018700002402042700002902066700002402095700002002119700002102139700001902160700002002179773011202199852000902311856008502320655001202405IND4420922820221119230401.0090522s2009    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442092282DNAL7 a10.1007/s00265-009-0748-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuchard, Elise10aStudying shape in sexual signals: the case of primate sexual swellings  ap. 1231-1242.  aIncludes references  aDespite extensive research on animal signals, their shape has been largely overlooked compared to other components such as size or colour. This may represent a substantial gap in our understanding of animal communication, since shape perception is believed to influence various processes in behavioural ecology, from prey-predator interactions to mate recognition. The technical challenge of measuring shape may explain this bias. This study introduces a morphometric method for the analysis of shape in animal signals and applies it to the study of patterns of shape variation in a classical sexual signal: the sexual swellings of female primates. Using elliptic Fourier descriptors (EFDs), we derived quantitative estimates of the two-dimensional shapes of sexual swellings in two primate populations: wild chacma baboons (Papio ursinus) from Namibia and captive mandrills (Mandrillus sphinx) from Gabon. Despite intra-specific variability, the two species exhibited consistently different swelling shapes. Within species, our analysis further showed more variation in swelling shape between females than across consecutive oestrous cycles of the same female. Using human judges, we confirmed that individual shape differences were visually detectable within both species. Finally, the relationships between individual traits and swelling shape were investigated, revealing age-associated variation in swelling shape in both species. Our study illustrates the high potentialities of EFDs to analyse patterns of shape variation at various scales: not only between species but also between and within individuals. 3aPapio ursinus 3aanimal communication 3acolor 3afemales 3apredator-prey relationships 3aGabon 3aNamibia1 aBenavides, Julio A.1 aSetchell, Joanna M.1 aCharpentier, Marie J.

Previous studies mainly focused on birth outcomes and did not study fetal growth during pregnancy. In a prospective cohort study from early pregnancy onwards in The Netherlands, we assessed the associations of first-trimester maternal total-fish, lean-fish, fatty-fish and shellfish consumption with fetal growth characteristics in the second and third trimesters, growth characteristics at birth and the risks of neonatal complications, including pre-term birth, low birth weight and small for gestational age. In total, 3380 mothers completed a 293-item semi-quantitative FFQ to obtain information about fish consumption during the first trimester of pregnancy. Head circumference, femur length and fetal weight were estimated in the second and third trimesters by ultrasound. Information about birth anthropometrics and neonatal complications was available from hospital and midwife registries. Maternal older age, higher educational level, folic acid supplement use, alcohol use and not smoking were associated with higher fish consumption (P < 0·01). After adjustment, we observed no consistent associations of maternal total-fish consumption or specific consumption of lean fish, fatty fish or shellfish with fetal growth characteristics in the second and third trimesters and at birth. Likewise, total-fish consumption or specific consumption of any type of fish was not consistently associated with the risks of neonatal complications. These findings suggest that in a population with a relatively low fish intake, consumption of lean fish, fatty fish or shellfish in the first trimester is not associated with fetal growth or the risks of neonatal complications. 3aalcohols 3acohort studies 3aeducational status 3afatty fish 3afemur 3afetal development 3afish consumption 3afolic acid 3ahead circumference 3alean fish 3alow birth weight 3amidwives 3amothers 3apregnancy 3arisk 3ashellfish 3asmall for gestational age 3aultrasonics 2aAdolescent 2aAdult 2aAge Factors 2aDiet 2aDietary Fatsxadministration & dosage 2aEducational Status 2aFemale 2aFetal Developmentxdrug effects 2aFetal Weight 2aFolic Acidxadministration & dosage 2aGestational Age 2aHumans 2aInfant, Low Birth Weight 2aInfant, Newborn 2aMiddle Aged 2aPregnancy 2aPremature Birthxetiology 2aPrenatal Nutritional Physiological Phenomena 2aProspective Studies 2aSurveys and Questionnaires. 2aSeafood 2aSmoking 2aYoung Adult 3aNetherlands 0aNetherlands1 aSteegers, Eric A.P.1 aTimmermans, Sarah1 aBreeijen, Hanneke den1 aTiemeier, Henning1 aHofman, A.1 aJaddoe, Vincent W.V.0 tBritish journal of nutrition.g2011 Mar., v. 105, no. 6 p.938-949dCABI Pubx0007-11457nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S00071145100044603Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02971naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002000164245012800184300001600312500002400328520127800352650001101630650001801641650000901659650001101668650000901679650002101688650001001709650001901719650000801738650002301746650001701769650002301786650001501809650001001824650001501834650001001849650001001859650002101869650002301890650003801913650001101951650001101962650000901973650004201982650004302024651001202067651001202079700002402091700002102115700001902136700002302155773009702178852000902275856008502284655001202369IND4458338120221119230558.0110522s2011    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445833812DNAL7 a213669332pmid7 a10.1017/S00071145100045872doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSioen, Isabelle10aConsumption of plant sterols in Belgium: estimated intakes and sources of naturally occurring plant sterols and β-carotene  ap. 960-966.  aIncludes references  aThe objective of the present study was to assess the intake of naturally occurring plant sterols and β-carotene via the overall diet of Belgian pre-school children and adults. Two different Belgian food consumption databases were used: (1) one with consumption data of pre-school children (2·5–6·5 years old) and (2) one with consumption data of adults ( ≥ 15 years old). These consumption data were combined with a newly developed database containing the plant sterol and β-carotene content in all relevant food items based on international food composition databases and scientific literature. The results show that Flemish pre-school children have a median plant sterol intake of 172 (interquartile range (IQR) = 47) and 184 (IQR = 52) mg/d for girls and boys, respectively. Their median β-carotene intake was 1857 (IQR = 1250) μg/d, without significant difference between girls and boys. Belgian women and men have a median plant sterol intake of 218 (IQR = 113) and 280 (IQR = 158) mg/d, respectively, and a median β-carotene intake of 2086 (IQR = 1254) μg/d (not significantly different between the sexes). The main food source of naturally occurring plant sterols was bread and other cereal products. For β-carotene, the main food source was vegetables. 3aadults 3abeta-carotene 3aboys 3abreads 3adiet 3afood consumption 3agirls 3agrain products 3amen 3anutrient databanks 3aphytosterols 3apreschool children 3avegetables 3awomen 2aAdolescent 2aAdult 2aChild 2aChild, Preschool 2aDatabases, Factual 2aDietxstatistics & numerical data 2aFemale 2aHumans 2aMale 2aPhytosterolsxadministration & dosage 2abeta Carotenexadministration & dosage 3aBelgium 0aBelgium1 aMatthys, Christophe1 aHuybrechts, Inge1 aCamp, John Van1 aHenauw, Stefaan De0 tBritish journal of nutrition.g2011 Mar., v. 105, no. 6 p.960-966dCABI Pubx0007-11457nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S00071145100045873Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02857naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001500152245009900167300001600266500002400282520159300306650002901899650001301928650001901941650001601960650001401976650002401990650001202014650001102026650001302037650001702050650003302067650001202100650001802112650001102130700001302141700001602154700001402170700001402184700001102198773011702209852000902326856007602335655001202411IND4382768920221119230316.0060813s2006    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438276892DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-2672.2006.02929.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYuan, Y.J.10aOptimization of a medium for enhancing nicotine biodegradation by Ochrobactrum intermedium DN2  ap. 691-697.  aIncludes references  aTo optimize a medium for nicotine degradation by Ochrobactrum intermedium DN2 in presence of yeast extract, glucose and Tween 80 using response surface methodology (RSM). In this study, the effects of yeast extract, glucose and Tween 80 on nicotine degradation were investigated in flasks using a novel nicotine-degrading bacterium, O. intermedium DN2. A full factorial central composite design was applied in the design of experiments and in the analysis of the experimental data. The results showed that the most significant variable influencing nicotine degradation was yeast extract, followed by glucose, and then Tween 80. Moreover these three factors interacted with each other and combined to produce positive effects on nicotine degradation. The experimental data also allowed the development of an empirical model (P < 0·0001) describing the inter-relationship between independent and dependent variables. By solving the regression equation, the optimal values of the variables were determined as: yeast extracts 0·094%, glucose 0·101% and Tween 80 0·080%. Using the medium obtained, about 1220 mg l⁻¹ of nicotine was degraded (95·55%) within 10 h at the specific biodegradation of 116·59 mg l⁻¹ h⁻¹ in 30-l bioreactor containing 25-l tobacco extract. An optimal medium of nicotine degradation by the strain DN2 was obtained. RSM proved to be reliable in developing the model, optimizing factors and analysing interaction effects. The results provide better understanding on the interactions between yeast extract, glucose and Tween 80 for nicotine biodegradation. 3aOchrobactrum intermedium 3abacteria 3abiodegradation 3abioreactors 3aequations 3aexperimental design 3aglucose 3amodels 3anicotine 3apolysorbates 3aresponse surface methodology 3atobacco 3ayeast extract 3ayeasts1 aLu, Z.X.1 aHuang, L.J.1 aBie, X.M.1 aLü, F.X.1 aLi, Y.0 tJournal of applied microbiology.g2006 Sept., v. 101, no. 3 p.691-697dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx1364-50727nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2672.2006.02929.x3electronic resource 7aarticle02980naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001600152245006900168300001600237500002400253520141300277650003001690650002601720650004401746650003301790650001301823650001701836650001201853650001101865650001001876650002001886650002201906650003001928650003701958650004501995650001802040650001102058700001602069700001802085700001902103700002602122700001402148700001802162700001602180700001502196700002102211700001602232773011702248852000902365856007602374655001202450IND4382768720221119230331.0060813s2006    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438276872DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-2672.2006.02922.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMounier, J.10aSources of the adventitious microflora of a smear-ripened cheese  ap. 668-681.  aIncludes references  aTo determine the relationships between the major organisms from the cheese-making personnel and environment and the surface of a smear cheese. 360 yeast and 593 bacteria from the cheese surface, the dairy environment and the hands and arms of personnel were collected. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis, repetitive sequence-based polymerase chain reaction and 16S rDNA sequencing were used for typing and identifying the bacteria, and mitochondrial DNA restriction fragment length polymorphism and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy for typing and identifying the yeast. The three most dominant bacteria were Corynebacterium casei, Corynebacterium variabile and Staphylococcus saprophyticus, which were divided into three, five and seven clusters, respectively, by macrorestriction analysis. The same clones from these organisms were isolated on the cheese surface, the dairy environment and the skin of the cheese personnel. Debaryomyces hansenii was the most dominant yeast. A 'house' microflora exists in the cheese plant. Although the original source of the micro-organisms was not identified, the brines were an important source of S. saprophyticus and D. hansenii and, additionally, the arms and hands of the workers the sources of C. casei and C. variabile. This is the first time that the major contribution of the house microflora to the ripening of a smear-ripened cheese has been demonstrated. 3aCorynebacterium variabile 3aDebaryomyces hansenii 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aStaphylococcus saprophyticus 3abacteria 3acheesemaking 3acheeses 3aclones 3ahands 3ahuman resources 3amitochondrial DNA 3apolymerase chain reaction 3apulsed-field gel electrophoresis 3arestriction fragment length polymorphism 3aribosomal DNA 3ayeasts1 aGoerges, S.1 aGelsomino, R.1 aVancanneyt, M.1 aVandemeulebroecke, K.1 aHoste, B.1 aBrennan, N.M.1 aScherer, S.1 aSwings, J.1 aFitzgerald, G.F.1 aCogan, T.M.0 tJournal of applied microbiology.g2006 Sept., v. 101, no. 3 p.668-681dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx1364-50727nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2672.2006.02922.x3electronic resource 7aarticle03741naa a2200613 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002500164245014600189300001600335500002400351520179500375650002302170650002402193650002002217650002002237650001202257650002702269650002602296650001902322650001902341650000702360650001902367650001702386650001602403650001902419650001302438650004802451650001202499650001402511650004102525650004902566650003602615650004502651650001002696650004802706650005102754650002802805650001302833650003302846651001302879651001302892700002002905700002102925700002002946773009202966852000903058856004803067655001203115IND4385800620221119230418.0061210e200611  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438580062DNAL7 a170829972pmid7 a10.1007/s00248-006-9084-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFrancoeur, Steven N.10aPeriphytic Photosynthetic Stimulation of Extracellular Enzyme Activity in Aquatic Microbial Communities Associated with Decaying Typha Litter  ap. 662-669.  aIncludes references  aWe examined the effect of light on extracellular enzyme activities of periphytic/endogenous microbial assemblages associated with decomposing litter of an emergent macrophyte Typha angustifolia within a small inland wetland in southeastern Michigan. Standing-dead Typha leaf litter was collected, placed into floating wire mesh litter baskets, and submerged in a wetland pool. Enzyme saturation assays were conducted on three occasions following litter submergence (days 9, 28, and 44) to generate saturation curves for the individual enzymes tested and to examine potential differences in enzyme saturation kinetics during microbial colonization and development. Experimental light manipulations were conducted on two occasions during microbial development (days 10 and 29). Short-term (30 min) light exposure significantly increased extracellular β-glucosidase activity of litter-associated microbial communities. Activities of β-xylosidase and leucine-aminopeptidase were not stimulated, and stimulation of phosphatase activity was variable. The exact mechanism for increased enzyme activity remains unknown, but it may have been increased pH arising from periphytic algal photosynthesis. These results suggest that extracellular enzyme activity in microbial communities colonizing natural organic substrata may be influenced by light/photosynthesis, as has previously been demonstrated for periphyton communities grown on artificial, inert substrata. Thus, light/photosynthetic mediated stimulation of extracellular enzyme activities may be a common occurrence in microbial communities associated with natural decaying plant litter in wetlands and might engender diurnal patterns in other microbial decay processes (e.g., production, organic matter decomposition, and mineralization). 3aTypha angustifolia 3aaquatic communities 3aenzyme activity 3aenzyme kinetics 3aenzymes 3amicrobial colonization 3amicrobial communities 3amineralization 3aorganic matter 3apH 3aphotosynthesis 3aplant litter 3asubmergence 3awetland plants 3awetlands 2aBacteriaxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aBiomass 2aEcosystem 2aEnzyme Activationxradiation effects 2aEukaryotaxgrowth & developmentxphysiology. 2aExtracellular Spacexenzymology 2aFungixgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aLight 2aPhosphoric Monoester Hydrolasesxmetabolism 2aPhotosynthesisxphysiologyxradiation effects. 2aTyphaceaexmicrobiology 2aWetlands 2abeta-Glucosidasexmetabolism 3aMichigan 0aMichigan1 aSchaecher, Mark1 aNeely, Robert K.1 aKuehn, Kevin A.0 tMicrobial ecology.g2006 Nov., v. 52, no. 4 p.662-669dSpringer-Verlagx0095-36287nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00248-006-9084-2 7aarticle02148naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001600128245007500144300001800219300002300237520080100260650002901061650001001090650001201100650002001112650002001132650000801152650002501160650002401185650001801209650001501227650002301242650002301265650001801288650002801306650004301334650003901377650002701416700001501443700001601458700001801474700001901492700001401511773007401525852000901599939003301608946001301641655001201654IND8804786820221119230424.0881011e19880909xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND880478682DNAL7 a28428672pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGoebl, M.G.14aThe yeast cell cycle gene CDC34 encodes a ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme  ap. 1331-1335.  ap. 1331-1335. ill.  aMutants in the gene CDC34 of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae are defective in the transition from G1 to the S phase of the cell cycle. This gene was cloned and shown to encode a 295-residue protein that has substantial sequence similarity to the product of the yeast RAD6 gene. The RAD6 gene is required for a variety of cellular functions including DNA repair and was recently shown to encode a ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme. When produced in Escherichia coli, the CDC34 gene product catalyzed the covalent attachment of ubiquitin to histones H2A and H2B in vitro, demonstrating that the CDC34 protein is another distinct member of the family of ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes. The cell cycle function of CDC34 is thus likely to be mediated by the ubiquitin-conjugating activity of its product. 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3agenes 3amutants 3acell physiology 3aenzyme activity 3aDNA 3anucleotide sequences 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aBase Sequence 2aCell Cycle 2aChromosome Mapping 2aCloning, Molecular 2aGenes, Fungal 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aProtein Processing, Post-Translational 2aSaccharomyces cerevisiaexgenetics 2aUbiquitinsxmetabolism1 aYochem, J.1 aJentsch, S.1 aMcGrath, J.P.1 aVarshavsky, A.1 aByers, B.0 tScience.g1988 Sept. 9, v. 241, no. 4871 p.1331-1335x0036-80757nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19881011c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02431naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001400128245017600142300001400318520134500332650001201677650001101689650002501700650001601725650002501741650001201766650002601778650002601804650001301830650000901843650001601852650003701868700001401905773008501919852000902004939003302013946001102046655001202057IND9303032620221119230419.0930519s1992    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND930303262DNAL7 a14039922pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPires, A.10aTemperature coupling in cricket acoustic communication. I. Field and laboratory studies of temperature effects on calling song production and recognition in Gryllus firmus  ap. 69-78.  aTemperature effects on calling song production and recognition were investigated in the North American field cricket, Gryllus firmus. Temporal parameters of field-recorded G. firmus calling song are strongly affected by temperature. Chirp rate and syllable rate increase, by factors of 4 and 2, respectively, as linear functions of temperature over the range in which these animals sing in the field (12 degrees-30 degrees C). Temperature affects syllable duration to a lesser extent, and does not influence calling song carrier frequency. Female phonotactic preference, measured on a spherical treadmill in the laboratory, also changes with temperature such that warmer females prefer songs with faster chirp and syllable rates. Best phonotaxis, measured as accuracy of orientation to the sound source, and highest walking velocity, occur in response to temperature-matched songs at 15 degrees, 21 degrees, and 30 degreed C. Experiments under semi-natural conditions in an outdoor arena revealed that females perform phonotaxis at temperatures as low as 13 degrees C. Taken together, the song and phonotaxis data demonstrate that this communication system is temperature coupled. A strategy is outlined by which temperature coupling may be exploited to test hypotheses about the organization of neural networks subserving song recognition. 3aGryllus 3asounds 3aanimal communication 3atemperature 2aAnimal Communication 2aAnimals 2aCognitionxphysiology 2aGryllidaexphysiology 2aKinetics 2aMale 2aTemperature 2aVocalization, Animalxphysiology1 aHoy, R.R.0 tJournal of comparative physiology.g1992, v. 171, no. 1 p.69-78x0340-75947nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02764naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001300128245012000141300001800261500001500279520112700294650004401421650000801465650001701473650003201490650001001522650001901532650002001551650002301571650002201594650001201616650001901628650001501647650003001662650001001692650001801702650002001720650001101740650001101751650004001762650000901802650001601811650002301827650003001850650001601880653002101896700001501917700001701932700001501949700001701964700001501981773009801996852000902094930003302103945001302136946001302149655001202162IND2044479520221119230452.0950207e199406  mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204447952DNAL7 a81980512pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRoss, R.10aSex differences in lean and adipose tissue distribution by magnetic resonance imaging: anthropometric relationships  ap. 1277-1285.  a2019-12-05  aThis study compared total and regional adipose tissue (AT) and lean tissue (LT) distribution measured by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in obese, android women (n = 40) and men (n = 17). Women had significantly (P < 0.01) greater subcutaneous AT (39.6 +/- 11.6 vs 30.7 +/- 7.5 L) but significantly (P < 0.01) less visceral AT (2.5 +/- 1.1 vs 4.8 +/- 2.1 L) and LT (42.8 +/- 4.7 vs 58.2 +/- 6.2 L) compared with men. Segmentation of the visceral AT volume demonstrated that women had significantly (P < 0.01) less intraperitoneal (1.98 +/- 0.84 vs 3.74 +/- 1.61 L) and extraperitoneal AT (0.51 +/- 0.23 vs 1.04 +/- 0.47 L). When the legs, hip and pelvic region, and abdomen and torso regions were compared, women had significantly greater absolute quantities of subcutaneous AT and significantly less LT in all regions (P < 0.01); however, in all regions the relative distribution of both was similar. Anthropometric prediction of MRI-measured total AT gave SEs of 7.7% for women and 7.5% for men, for visceral AT 30% for women and 19% for men. Anthropometric prediction of LT gave SEs of 6.5% for women and 3.6% for men. 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3amen 3abody regions 3aanthropometric measurements 3awomen 3aadipose tissue 3askeletal muscle 3agender differences 3abody measurements 3aobesity 3alean body mass 3aprediction 2aAdipose Tissuexpathology 2aAdult 2aAnthropometry 2aBody Mass Index 2aFemale 2aHumans 2aMagnetic Resonance Imagingxmethods 2aMale 2aMiddle Aged 2aObesityxpathology 2aPredictive Value of Tests 2aSex Factors 0abody composition1 aShaw, K.D.1 aRissanen, J.1 aMartel, Y.1 aDe Guise, J.1 aAvruch, L.0 tAmerican journal of clinical nutrition.g1994 June, v. 59, no. 6 p.1277-1285x0002-91657nnas  aDNAL  a19950303b19950309c00000000  aINDdHBI  aOther US 7aarticle02769naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001300128245011400141300001800255500001500273520111900288650002601407650001501433650002301448650001801471650001201489650002301501650001601524650001901540650001301559650001201572650001701584650001501601650002601616650001001642650002101652650002401673650002801697650001101725650004201736650002301778650002401801650003001825650002801855653001601883700001401899700001901913700001701932700001401949700002001963700001801983773009802001852000902099930003302108945001302141946001302154655001202167IND2044481320221119230456.0950207e199406  mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204448132DNAL7 a81980582pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSbai, D.10aContribution of odd-chain fatty acid oxidation to propionate production in disorders of propionate metabolism  ap. 1332-1337.  a2019-12-05  aWhole-body propionate and protein kinetics and energy substrate metabolism were studied in five metronidazole-treated patients with propionic or methylmalonic acidemias by the use of a primed, 4-h constant infusion of [1-13C]propionate and L-[O-2H5]phenylalanine combined with indirect calorimetry. Measurements were performed during fasting and carbohydrate feeding, successively, to assess the contribution of odd-chain fatty acid oxidation to total propionate production. Fat oxidation decreased from 490 +/- 179 to 57 +/- 49 micromoles. kg-1.h-1 (P < 0.05) as a result of feeding. Propionate appearance rate was 38.6 +/- 8 micromoles.kg-1.h-1 during fasting and decreased to 22.6 +/- 5 micromoles.kg-1.h-1 (P < 0.05) on the carbohydrate diet. Precursor amino acid catabolism did not change significantly (22 +/- 5 vs 21.2 +/- 5 micromoles.kg-1.h-1), suggesting that the 41% reduction in propionate production observed in response to feeding was related to the suppression of fatty acid oxidation. Therefore, significant therapeutic gains may be expected from the use of diets aimed at reducing lipid oxidation. 3aodd chain fatty acids 3ametabolism 3alipid peroxidation 3ablood glucose 3afasting 3ametabolic diseases 3aamino acids 3apropionic acid 3achildren 3ainsulin 3ablood plasma 2aAdolescent 2aCalorimetry, Indirect 2aChild 2aChild, Preschool 2aFastingxmetabolism 2aFatty Acidsxmetabolism 2aHumans 2aMetabolism, Inborn Errorsxmetabolism 2aModels, Biological 2aOxidation-Reduction 2aPhenylalaninexmetabolism 2aPropionatesxmetabolism 0afatty acids1 aNarcy, C.1 aThompson, G.N.1 aMariotti, A.1 aPoggi, F.1 aSaudubray, J.M.1 aBresson, J.L.0 tAmerican journal of clinical nutrition.g1994 June, v. 59, no. 6 p.1332-1337x0002-91657nnas  aDNAL  a19950303b19950309c00000000  aINDdHBI  aOther US 7aarticle03537naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002000164245014100184300001600325520170500341650002202046650001202068650001802080650002202098650001102120650006102131650003802192650003902230650002402269650002102293650002302314650003902337653003502376653000902411653000902420653002702429653001502456653004302471700002902514700002002543700002302563700002002586700001902606700002502625700002002650700002602670700001902696773011802715852000902833856008502842930003302927946001102960655001202971IND4437076520221119230621.0100514e201006  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443707652DNAL7 a201511792pmid7 a10.1007/s11010-010-0387-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYamazaki, Akio 10aMechanism for the regulation of mammalian cGMP phosphodiesterase6. 1: Identification of its inhibitory subunit complexes and their roles  ap. 215-233.  aCyclic GMP phosphodiesterase (PDE) in bovine rod photoreceptor outer segments (OS) comprises a catalytic subunit complex (Pαβ) and two inhibitory subunits (Pγ) and is regulated by the α subunit of transducin (Tα). Here, we show an overall mechanism for PDE regulation by identifying Pγ complexes in OS homogenates prepared with an isotonic buffer. Before Tα activation, three Pγ complexes exist in the soluble fraction. Complex a, a minor complex, contains Pαβ, Tα, and a protein named Pδ. Complex b, Pαβγγ b , has a PDE activity similar to that of membranous Pαβγγ, Pαβγγ M , and its level, although its large portion is Pδ-free, is estimated to be 20-30% of the total Pαβγγ. Complex c, (Pγ·GDP-Tα) ₂ c , appears to be a dimer of Pγ·GDP-Tα. Upon Tα activation, (1) complex a stays unchanged, (2) Pαβγγ b binds to membranes, (3) the level of (Pγ·GDP-Tα) ₂ c is reduced as its GTP-form is produced, (4) complex d, Pγ·GTP-Tα d , is formed on membranes and its substantial amount is released to the soluble fraction, and (5) membranous Pαβγγ, Pαβγγ M and/or Pαβγγ b , becomes Pγ-depleted. These observations indicate that Pγ as a complex with GTP-Tα dissociates from Pαβγγ on membranes and is released to the soluble fraction and that Pγ-depleted PDE is the GTP-Tα-activated PDE. After GTP hydrolysis, both (Pγ·GDP-Tα) ₂ c and Pγ·GDP-Tα d , without liberating Pγ, deactivate Pγ-depleted PDE. The preferential order to be used for the deactivation is membranous Pγ·GDP-Tα d , solubilized Pγ·GDP-Tα d and (Pγ·GDP-Tα) ₂ c . Release of Pγ·GTP-Tα complexes to the soluble fraction is relevant to light adaptation. 3aphototransduction 2aAnimals 2aBinding Sites 2aBlotting, Western 2aCattle 2aCyclic Nucleotide Phosphodiesterases, Type 6xmetabolism 2aGuanosine Diphosphatexmetabolism 2aGuanosine Triphosphatexmetabolism 2aImmunoprecipitation 2aProtein Subunits 2aRetinaxmetabolism 2aRod Cell Outer Segmentxmetabolism 0aRetinal cGMP phosphodiesterase 0aPDE6 0acGMP 0aRetinal photoreceptors 0aTransducin 0aG-protein-mediated signal transduction1 aBondarenko, Vladimir A. 1 aMatsuura, Isao 1 aTatsumi, Masahiro 1 aKurono, Sadamu 1 aKomori, Naoka 1 aMatsumoto, Hiroyuki 1 aHayashi, Fumio 1 aYamazaki, Russell K. 1 aUsukura, Jiro 0 tMolecular and cellular biochemistry.g2010 June, v. 339, no. 1-2 p.215-233dBoston : Springer USx0300-81777nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11010-010-0387-83Available from publisher's Web site  a20100514b20100605c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02487naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002500110245012000135300001600255500001500271520138200286650002601668650002001694650003601714650003201750650000901782650001001791650002801801653002701829653001001856653003601866653002001902700001701922700001901939773010201958852000902060939003302069946001102102655001202113IND9303035520221119230543.0930519e199209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND930303552DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLee-Stadelmann, O.Y.10aIncompatibility conditioned by the MIa gene in powdery mildew of barley: change in permeability to non-electrolytes  ap. 165-177.  a2019-12-04  aPassive permeability of host cells to the non-electrolytes, methyl and ethyl urea, was measured plasmometrically in epidermal tissue from barley Hordeum vulgare, inoculated with Erysiphe graminis f.sp. hordei. Incompatibility, conditioned by the Mla gene for resistance, was expressed by hypersensitive collapse of haustorium-containing host cells, 1-2 h after cytoplasmic streaming stopped. Measurements were made about 20 h after inoculation, either before or after the halt in streaming. Before streaming stopped, permeability of haustorium-containing cells to methyl and ethyl urea was reduced about 30%. Permeability to methyl urea was reduced also in neighboring cells without haustoria. Cells in tissues with decreased permeability exhibited high frequencies of concave plasmolysis, indicative of increased adhesion between the plasmalemma and the cell wall. After cytoplasmic streaming stopped, but prior to cell collapse, permeability to ethyl urea was reduced to 50% of values for non-inoculated tissues. The results indicate that structural changes which reduce permeability to non-electrolytes occur in the lipid bilayer of the host plasmalemma and that these changes that may be related to reduced membrane fluidity. These changes are similar in incompatible and compatible host-parasite combinations but occur earlier and to a greater degree with incompatibility. 3amembrane permeability 3aHordeum vulgare 3aBlumeria graminis f. sp. hordei 3ahost-parasite relationships 3aurea 3agenes 3ahypersensitive response 0aprotoplasmic streaming 0alines 0aErysiphe graminis f. sp. hordei 0aincompatibility1 aCurran, C.M.1 aBushnell, W.R.0 tPhysiological and molecular plant pathology.g1992 Sept., v. 41, no. 3 p.165-177x0885-57657nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02668naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001800128245017300146300001800319520113800337650002401475650002001499650002401519650002301543650002001566650001801586650000901604650001601613650001701629650001201646650001201658650002001670650003901690650002901729650001101758650001101769650001101780650002001791650002601811650003101837650002701868650002101895700001701916700002001933700001901953773009801972852000902070930003302079945001302112946001302125655001202138IND2044479920221119230519.0950207e199406  mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204447992DNAL7 a81980542pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHeiskanen, K.10aReference ranges for erythrocyte pyridoxal 5'-phosphate concentration and the erythrocyte aspartate transaminase stimulation test in lactating mothers and their infants  ap. 1297-1303.  aWe determined reference ranges for erythrocyte pyridoxal 5'-phosphate concentrations (EPLP) and erythrocyte aspartate transaminase basal activities (EASTo) and activation coefficients (alpha-EAST) in lactating mothers and infants from data of mothers receiving a vitamin B-6 supplement and infants breast-fed by mothers with adequate vitamin B6 status. The mothers' vitamin B6 status was assessed on the third day postpartum (pp) (n = 91) and at 2 mo (n = 114), 4 mo (n = 117), 6 mo (n = 110), and 9 mo (n = 40) pp and that of the exclusively breast-fed infants at 2 mo (n = 90), 4 mo (n = 106), and 6 mo (n = 99). We also examined 9-mo-old infants (n = 39) who, besides breast milk, had received solids after 6 mo, and 12-mo-old infants (n = 100) who had received solids beginning at 4-6 mo and dairy products at 9 mo. Values indicating deficiency for at least two of the three indexes distinguished the 5-10% of mothers and infants with the lowest vitamin B6 status. The reference ranges for EPLP, EASTo, and alpha-EAST for infants and for mothers during the first months of lactation differ from those reported earlier for adults. 3apyridoxal phosphate 3ahuman lactation 3areference standards 3anutritional status 3aenzyme activity 3atransaminases 3adiet 3abreast milk 3ainfant foods 3ainfants 3amothers 3alactating women 2aAspartate Aminotransferasesxblood 2aErythrocytesxmetabolism 2aFemale 2aHumans 2aInfant 2aInfant, Newborn 2aLactationxmetabolism 2aPyridoxal Phosphatexblood 2aPyridoxinexmetabolism 2aReference Values1 aSiimes, M.A.1 aPerheentupa, J.1 aSalmenpera, L.0 tAmerican journal of clinical nutrition.g1994 June, v. 59, no. 6 p.1297-1303x0002-91657nnas  aDNAL  a19950303b19950309c00000000  aINDdHBI  aOther US 7aarticle02198naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001900110245006900129300001800198500016200216520097900378650001701357650001901374650001801393650001601411650001201427650002301439650001201462650002301474650002401497650001001521650002601531653001101557700001601568700001901584700001801603773009901621852000901720930003301729945001301762946001301775655001201788IND2041207020221119230529.0940802e199308  mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204120702DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEtherton, T.D.10aMechanisms by which somatotropin decreases adipose tissue growth  ap. 287S-295S.  aIn the special issue: Impact of biotechnology on the food supply / edited by D.M. Bier. Proceedings of a symposium held April 30-May 1, 1990, Washington, DC.  aWhen growing pigs are treated daily with recombinantly derived porcine somatotropin (pST) for 30-60 d there is a dose-dependent decrease in lipid accretion. Maximal doses of pST can reduce lipid accretion by as much as 70%. The reduction in lipid accretion occurs because of a marked decrease in glucose transport and lipogenesis that is the result of a pST-dependent decrease in the ability of insulin to stimulate these processes in the adipocyte; lipolysis is not affected. The decrease in insulin sensitivity is not due to a decrease in insulin binding or insulin receptor kinase activity. Little is understood about the somatotropin (ST) intracellular signal pathway(s) that mediate the biological effects of ST. These effects are chronic rather than acute as was previously believed. This pattern likely reflects that ST decreases transcription of important insulin-responsive genes such as the muscle-adipose tissue transporter gene (GLUT4) and key lipogenic enzymes. 3asomatotropin 3aadipose tissue 3adose response 3alipogenesis 3aglucose 3anutrient transport 3ainsulin 3afood biotechnology 3agenetic engineering 3aswine 3agenetic recombination 0agrowth1 aLouveau, I.1 aSorensen, M.T.1 aChaudhuri, S.0 tAmerican journal of clinical nutrition.g1993 Aug., v. 58, no. 2S p.287S-295Sx0002-91657nnas  aDNAL  a19940907b19940913c00000000  aINDdHBI  aOther US 7aarticle03483naa a2200289 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002000110245013900130300001500269520255100284650001902835650001902854650002102873650001502894650002002909650002102929650001502950653001202965773015102977852000903128939003303137946001103170655001203181IND9303031820221119230227.0930519e199201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND930303182DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBolland, M.D.A.10aResidual value of superphosphate measured using yields of different pasture legume species and bicarbonate-extractable soil phosphorus  ap. 95-110.  aThe residual value of superphosphate was measured in three glasshouse pot experiments using three different lateritic soils (pH CaCl2: 4.8-5.3) from south-western Australia. The residual value was estimated relative to levels of freshly-applied superphosphate using yield of dried tops and bicarbonate-soluble P extracted from the soil (soil test values). Up to five successive crops were grown. In each experiment, four different pasture legume species fertilized with mineral nitrogen were grown in rotation with a cereal species. The legume species included Medicago polymorpha, M. murex, Trifolium subterraneum, Ornithopus compressus, O. perpusillus and O. pinnatus. The cereal species included Triticum aestivum, X Triticosecale, and Hordeum vulgare. The comparative phosphorus (P) requirement of the different pasture legumes was estimated from the amount of P required to produce 50 or 90% of the maximum yield measured for each species at each harvest. Soil samples for the soil test were collected just before sowing each crop, and were related to the plant yields of that crop. Relative to freshly-applied superphosphate, the residual value of superphosphate measured using plant yield was similar for all pasture legume species, and decreased markedly, by about 50 to 80% between the first and second crop, and by a further 5 to 30% for subsequent crops. The decrease in residual value estimated using soil test values was less marked. For freshly-applied superphosphate, and for the same plant species, the relationship between yield and the level of P applied differed for different crops. There was no consistent, systematic trend for the comparative P requirement of the different legume species within and between crops of the three experiments and soils. For all crops, the relationship between yield of dried tops and P concentration in dried tissue generally differed for the different legume species, indicating the different species usually have different internal efficiency of P use curves. However, for each experiment, when the same cereal species was grown in all the pots, the relationship between yield and P concentration in tissue was similar for previously- and freshly-applied superphosphate, regardless of the pasture legume species grown in previous crops. The relationship between yield and soil test values usually differed, within each crop, for different plant species and for previously- and freshly-applied superphosphate. For the same plant species, the relationship also differed between different crops. 3aforage legumes 3asuperphosphate 3aresidual effects 3aphosphorus 3anutrient uptake 3asoil test values 3acrop yield 0aspecies0 tFertilizer research : an international journal on fertilizer use and technology.g1992 Jan., v. 31, no. 1 p.95-110wJournal:20227x0167-17317nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02991naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002000110245011600130300001600246500001500262520149600277650002001773650002201793650002001815650003101835650001001866650001901876650001701895650001501912650002001927650002001947650002201967650002001989650002102009650001102030650001302041650001802054650001602072650000902088650002002097650004302117650001702160650001302177653001902190700001802209700001802227700001802245700001802263773009002281852000902371930003302380945001302413946001102426655001202437IND2061226120221119230235.0980112e199704  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND206122612DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRosenberg, L.A.10aIdentification of mRNAs and proteins in higher plants using probes from the Band 3 anion transporter of mammals  ap. 857-868.  a2019-12-05  aBand 3 is a well characterized ion transporter in mammalian cells. To determine if Zea mays expressed Band 3-related polypeptides, polyclonal antibodies to a 13-amino acid sequence at the carboxyl terminal end of the membrane domain of the mouse Band 3 anion transporter was used in immunoblot studies. This antiserum detected three classes of polypeptides from maize roots. The polypeptides had apparent molecular masses of 43, 46 and 59 kDa and appeared to be integral membrane components associated with various cellular membranes including the plasma membrane. Maize genomic DNA did not contain sequences that cross-hybridized with the mouse cDNA encoding the C-terminal membrane domain of Band 3. However, an oligonucleotide corresponding to a portion of the 13-amino acid sequence used for antibody preparation detected mRNAs from both monocotyledonous and dicotyledonous plants. The maize root and leaf mRNAs that were detected were 1.75, 1.45, and 0.88 kb in size. The levels of the 1.75- and 1.45 kb mRNAs in maize roots did not change dramatically in response to nitrate; however, the 0.88 kb transcript levels increased in response to nitrate. Using the 32P-labelled Band 3 oligonucleotide, a partial cDNA clone (gamma B3-2758) encoding a 0.88 kb transcript was isolated. The abundance of the B3-2758 and nitrate reductase transcripts increased markedly in response to nitrate in an amino acid-grown maize cell line and was well correlated with the induction of nitrate transport. 3aimmunochemistry 3anitrate reductase 3aanimal proteins 3anucleic acid hybridization 3aroots 3aplant proteins 3apolypeptides 3aDNA probes 3anutrient uptake 3agene expression 3amembrane proteins 3aplasma membrane 3amolecular weight 3aleaves 3aZea mays 3amessenger RNA 3aGlycine max 3amice 3aenzyme activity 3aSolanum lycopersicum var. lycopersicum 3aAvena sativa 3anitrates 0acell membranes1 aPadgett, P.E.1 aAssmann, S.M.1 aWalling, L.L.1 aLeonard, R.T.0 tJournal of experimental botany.g1997 Apr., v. 48, no. 309 p.857-868x0022-09577nnas  aDNAL  a19980201b19980206c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US 7aarticle01769naa a2200265 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245014700126300001200273520097800285650002401263650002101287650001101308650001201319650001001331700001401341773008301355852000901438939003301447946001101480655001201491IND9303032120221119230214.0930519s1992    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND930303212DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTomioka, K.10aCharacterization of an optic lobe circadian pacemaker by in situ and in vitro recording of neural activity in the cricket, Gryllus bimaculatus  ap. 1-7.  aThe nature of the circadian rhythms of the optic lamina-medulla compound eye complex was examined in male crickets Gryllus bimaculatus by recording the multiple unit activity from the optic lobe in situ and in vitro. In most in situ preparations, the neural activity of the complex was higher during the subjective night than during the subjective day, both under constant light and dark. The same pattern was also obtained from nymphal crickets, suggesting that the properties of the pacemaker are common to both nymphs and adults. In a few cases, both diurnal and nocturnal increments in the activity were simultaneously observed, indicating there are two neuronal groups conveying different circadian information. The circadian rhythm was also demonstrated in the optic lobes in vitro, providing evidence that the optic lobe contains the circadian pacemaker that is capable of generating the rhythmicity without any neural or humoral factors from the rest of the animal. 3aGryllus bimaculatus 3acircadian rhythm 3avision 3aneurons 3alight1 aChiba, Y.0 tJournal of comparative physiology.g1992, v. 171, no. 1 p.1-7x0340-75947nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02413naa a2200277 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001500110245009400125300001400219520164700233650002301880650001101903650000901914650001101923650001901934653001301953700001901966773008501985852000902070939003302079946001102112655001202123IND9303032420221119230124.0930519s1992    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND930303242DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRobert, D.10aLocust flight steering. I. Head movements and the organization of correctional manoeuvres  ap. 41-51.  aLocusts (Locusta migratoria) were flown in a flight simulator which converts yaw torque into angular motion of the visual environment. The modalities and the time-course of steering behavior under these closed-loop conditions have been investigated. Locusts flying under visual closed-loop conditions stabilize their visual environment by performing correctional steering manoeuvres. Besides torque production, due to differential wing movements and ruddering, correctional steering also involves head movements. During open-loop steering, ruddering and yaw torque begin some 60 ms after the onset of the visually simulated deviation from course. Head movements occur some 90 ms after stimulus onset, i.e. some 30 ms later than yaw torque and therefore do not initiate thoracic steering outputs. Open- and closed-loop correctional steering do not differ in their behavioral components or temporal organization. In the absence of major disturbances, correctional steering under closed-loop conditions is performed with minimal ruddering (only a few degrees in amplitude), that probably produces little or no aerodynamic drag Locusts prevented from moving their heads still stabilize their visual environment in the closed-loop situation. However, the precision of steering is affected by this constraint. Head immobilization also alters the temporal coordination of correctional steering. These results show that head movements, in addition to their generally accepted role in vision improvement, also contribute to the precision and temporal coordination of correctional flight manoeuvres. The mechanism is partly via proprioceptive feedback. 3aLocusta migratoria 3aflight 3ahead 3avision 3aproprioception 0amovement1 aRowell, C.H.F.0 tJournal of comparative physiology.g1992, v. 171, no. 1 p.41-51x0340-75947nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03985naa a2200685 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003800111040001800149072000900167100002500176245014700201300001400348500002400362520166900386650001002055650001802065650002602083650001802109650001402127650001902141650002502160650002002185650001702205650001402222650001602236650002102252650002102273650001502294650001202309650003602321650002902357650001102386650005602397650001002453650005302463650003302516650003302549650002502582650005102607650006302658650002702721650007602748650003802824700002402862700003802886700002602924700002002950700002102970700002002991773011003011852000903121856008803130930003303218945002503251946001103276655001203287IND4438398820221119230213.0100611e201007  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443839882DNAL7 a202070152pmid7 a10.1016/j.vetimm.2010.02.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL8321 aCastro-Alonso, Ayoze10aChronological and immunohistochemical characterization of the mammary immunoinflammatory response in experimental caprine contagious agalactia  ap. 43-54.  aIncludes references  aTo explore the pathogenesis of caprine contagious agalactia (CA), we assessed the ability of Mycoplasma agalactiae (Ma) to modulate the immune system in host tissues by immunohistochemically and chronologically characterizing the main cell subsets present during the mammary immunoinflammatory response. Fifteen lactating goats were inoculated with 10¹⁰ colony-forming units (cfu) of Ma and killed 5, 15 or 45 days post-inoculation (dpi). Blood was taken before necropsy to determine antibodies and milk to determine mycoplasma number. Cells in mammary tissue expressing lysozyme, myeloid-histiocyte antigen (Mac387), major histocompatibility complex class II antigen, immunoglobulin G (IgG), IgA, and CD3, CD4 and CD8 lymphocytes were determined by immunohistochemistry. Results indicate an innate immune response in animals sacrificed at 5dpi, characterized by an abundance of Mac387+ and lysozyme+ cells, that was unable to block or control Ma infection. Elevated numbers of all the cell subsets of the specific immune response (MHC-II+, IgG+, IgA+, CD3+, CD4+ and CD8+ cells) were observed during the subacute stage of the inflammatory process, represented by the 15dpi group. However, these findings could not be correlated with an intense antibody response in blood. The chronic stage of the inflammatory process observed in the goats killed at 45dpi was mainly characterized by expansion of the CD8 compartment at the expense of the CD4 subset leading to a reduced CD4/CD8 ratio. These results contribute to establishing the basic morphological and immunohistochemical characterization of the local immune response against Ma in the goat's mammary gland. 3agoats 3agoat diseases 3aMycoplasma agalactiae 3amycoplasmosis 3aagalactia 3amammary glands 3aimmunohistochemistry 3aimmune response 3apathogenesis 3alactation 3alymphocytes 3aimmunoglobulin G 3aimmunoglobulin A 3aantibodies 2aAnimals 2aAntigens, Bacterialxmetabolism 2aAntigens, CDxmetabolism 2aFemale 2aGoat Diseasesximmunologyxmicrobiologyxpathology. 2aGoats 2aHistocompatibility Antigens Class IIxmetabolism 2aImmunoglobulin Axmetabolism 2aImmunoglobulin Gxmetabolism 2aImmunohistochemistry 2aMammary Glands, Animalximmunologyxpathology. 2aMastitisximmunologyxmicrobiologyxpathologyxveterinary. 2aMuramidasexmetabolism 2aMycoplasma Infectionsximmunologyxmicrobiologyxpathologyxveterinary. 2aMycoplasma agalactiaeximmunology1 aDe la Fe, Christian1 aEspinosa de los Monteros, Antonio1 aRodríguez, Francisco1 aAndrada, Marisa1 aPoveda, José B.1 aHerráez, Pedro0 tVeterinary immunology and immunopathology.g2010 July, v. 136, no. 1-2 p.43-54dElsevierx0165-24277nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vetimm.2010.02.0053Available from publisher's Web site  a20100907b20101001c00000000  aINDd6CTe2010/07/27  aNon-US 7aarticle02418naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001600128245008900144300001400233520136900247650001701616650001901633650001201652650002901664650002201693650003601715650003001751650002501781650004301806650001001849650003801859700002101897773008501918852000902003939003302012946001102045655001202056IND9303032320221119230119.0930519s1992    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND930303232DNAL7 a13286242pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDavis, R.E.10aExtracellular recordings from the motor nervous system of the nematode, Ascaris suum  ap. 17-28.  aThe close association of muscle and neurons in Ascaris suum makes it difficult to determine whether spikes recorded from nerve cords originate in muscle or neurons. We have developed criteria that distinguish muscle and neuronal activity. There are two categories of extracellular spikes. The first category consists of spikes with a wide range of amplitudes, marked by large spikes. These spikes, which can be recorded over lateral muscle and over the dorsal and ventral nerve cords, are abolished when muscle is disrupted or removed, or when curare is applied. Large spikes are relatively infrequent, are correlated with intracellularly recorded muscle events, and respond to polarizations of motor neurons, implying that they originate in muscle. The second spike category, small amplitude spikes, is exclusive to the ventral nerve cord, occurs more frequently than large spikes and displays patterned firing. Small spikes are not affected by muscle removal or by curare, and are correlated with motor neuronal postsynaptic potentials, but not with intracellularly recorded muscle events. We infer that they originate in neurons. Low level activity recorded extracellularly over nerve cords may represent muscle activity due to tonic motor neuronal synaptic transmission. It responds to motor neuronal polarization and is suppressed by curare or muscle removal. 3aAscaris suum 3anervous system 2aAnimals 2aAscaris suumxphysiology 2aElectrophysiology 2aExtracellular Spacexphysiology 2aMotor Neuronsxphysiology 2aMusclesxinnervation 2aNervous System Physiological Phenomena 2aSwine 2aSynaptic Transmissionxphysiology1 aStretton, A.O.W.0 tJournal of comparative physiology.g1992, v. 171, no. 1 p.17-28x0340-75947nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02444naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092040001800130072000900148072000900157100001700166245018200183300001600365500002400381500001500405520099700420650002201417650003001439650001801469650002401487650002301511650002401534650001601558650002201574650001101596653002001607653001701627700001701644700003101661700001601692773011201708852000901820856008801829930003301917945002501950946001101975655001201986IND4438397820221119230449.0100611e201007  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443839782DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vetimm.2010.02.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL832 0aL8101 aPrice, Sally10aDifferential distribution of WC1⁺ γδ TCR⁺ T lymphocyte subsets within lymphoid tissues of the head and respiratory tract and effects of intranasal M. bovis BCG vaccination  ap. 133-137.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aBCG vaccination of neonatal calves induces significant protection against bovine tuberculosis. The enhanced protection observed in neonatal calves may be linked to an enhanced capacity for IFNγ production by innate cells, including WC1⁺ γδ T cells, which constitute a major population in young cattle. Intranasal BCG vaccination of mice induces high levels of IFNγ in the lungs, which may enhance protection against subsequent challenge with virulent strains of mycobacteria. We used an intranasal BCG vaccination model in calves to study the effect on the distribution of WC1⁺ γδ T cells expressing two alternate forms of WC1: WC1.1 and WC1.2. These subsets of WC1⁺ γδ T cells have previously been shown to have a differential capacity for IFNγ secretion. Our results indicate that there is a selective expansion/recruitment of γδ T cells expressing the IFNγ-associated WC1.1 isoform in tissues of the lungs and upper respiratory tract following intranasal BCG vaccination. 3aprotein synthesis 3aintranasal administration 3aT-lymphocytes 3aMycobacterium bovis 3arespiratory system 3abovine tuberculosis 3avaccination 3aprotein secretion 3acalves 0acattle diseases 0ainterferon-y1 aDavies, Marc1 aVillarreal-Ramos, Bernardo1 aHope, Jayne0 tVeterinary immunology and immunopathology.g2010 July, v. 136, no. 1-2 p.133-137dElsevierx0165-24277nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vetimm.2010.02.0103Available from publisher's Web site  a20100907b20101001c00000000  aINDd6CTe2010/07/26  aNon-US 7aarticle02926naa a2200601 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146072001700164100001800181245009700199300001400296500001500310520107400325650001801399650002001417650002101437650002101458650001101479650002301490650001101513650001601524650001801540650003001558650001201588650001401600650001201614650001601626650004601642650002401688650006201712650004801774650003701822650002901859650001201888653002501900653002001925653002201945653002501967653003001992653001802022700001702040773009002057852000902147856008502156930003302241945002502274946001302299655001202312IND4418196920221119230513.0090325e200809  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441819692DNAL7 a184396192pmid7 a10.1016/j.jip.2008.03.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Endoreticulatus schubergi, a midgut pathogen, was transmitted to offspring via female and male via the egg chorion (transovum transmission). Between 8% and 29% of the emerging larvae became infected. No spores of E. schubergi were found in surface-washed eggs. Nosema lymantriae, a microsporidium that causes systemic infections, was transovarially transmitted. Between 35% and 72% of the progeny were infected. Vairimorpha disparis, a fat body pathogen, was not vertically transmitted. The infectivity of spores that overwintered in cadavers of infected L. dispar varied by species, placement in the environment, and weather conditions. Spores of E. schubergi were still infective after an eight month exposure period of cadavers on the ground. Spores of N. lymantriae and V. disparis remained highly infective only when cadavers overwintered under a more or less continuous snow cover for four months. 3aoverwintering 3aentomopathogens 3amicrosporidiosis 3aLymantria dispar 3aspores 3adisease prevalence 3aNosema 3aVairimorpha 3apathogenicity 3atransovarial transmission 3aprogeny 3ainfection 2aAnimals 2aHibernation 2aInfectious Disease Transmission, Vertical 2aLarvaxmicrobiology 2aMicrosporidiaxclassificationxpathogenicityxphysiology. 2aMicrosporidiosisxtransmissionxveterinary. 2aMothsxmicrobiologyxphysiology. 2aPest Control, Biological 2aSeasons 0aVairimorpha disparis 0ainsect cadavers 0aNosema lymantriae 0adisease transmission 0aEndoreticulatus schubergi 0aMicrosporidia1 aHoch, Gernot0 tJournal of invertebrate pathology.g2008 Sept., v. 99, no. 1 p.43-48x0022-20117nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jip.2008.03.0083Available from publisher's Web site  a20090623b20090703c00000000  aINDdNZMe2009/06/23  aOther US 7aarticle02870naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001500110245015200125300001800277500001500295520161300310650002301923650001401946650001001960650001401970650001401984650002801998650002302026650001702049650001202066650001002078650002102088650001102109651001002120653001502130653002202145653001502167653001802182653001102200700001602211700001602227773009102243852000902334930003302343945001302376946001102389655001202400IND2062279320221119230547.0980306e199705  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND206227932DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWinkel, T.10aEffect of the timing of water deficit on growth, phenology and yield of pearl millet (Pennisetum glaucum (L.) R.

The present study assessed the impact of water deficits at three development stages: prior to flowering (S30), at the beginning of flowering (S45), and at the end of flowering (S60) in pearl millet grown in experimental conditions similar to Sahelian farming conditions. It included a control irrigation treatment simulating the natural distribution of rainfall throughout the cropping season. Both biomass production and grain yield were severely reduced by S30 and S45, while S60 had no effect. In S30 and S45, the flowering of tillers was delayed or totally inhibited. In both of these treatments, the low number of productive tillers did not compensate for damage to panicle initiation and flowering of the main shoot. All treatments maintained green leaves on the main shoot during the grain filling period, and in S30 leaf growth recovered from mid-season drought. These results illustrate how pearl millet mostly escapes drought by matching its phenology to the mean rainfall distribution in the Sahel. In the case of mid-season drought, some late productive tillers and the maintenance of green leaf biomass of the main shoots limited, but did not overcome, the yield losses. This study stresses the importance of agro-ecological conditions in control treatments, particularly the water regime and crop density, when assessing crop drought resistance. 3atemporal variation 3aflowering 3astems 3atillering 3aphenology 3adry matter accumulation 3aPennisetum glaucum 3awater stress 3adrought 3aSahel 3ayield components 3aleaves 3aNiger 0aresistance 0acrop growth stage 0acrop yield 0awater deficit 0agrowth1 aRenno, J.F.1 aPayne, W.A.0 tJournal of experimental botany.g1997 May, v. 48, no. 310 p.1001-1009x0022-09577nnas  aDNAL  a19980401b19980408c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US 7aarticle01850naa a2200277 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001900110245005500129300001800184500016200202520092200364650001901286650002401305650001701329650002401346650002301370773009901393852000901492930003301501945001301534946001301547655001201560IND2041205020221119230510.0940802e199308  mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204120502DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPhillips, R.L.10aPlant genetics: out with the old, in with the new?  ap. 259S-263S.  aIn the special issue: Impact of biotechnology on the food supply / edited by D.M.

Approximately one-half of the increased yields of major crop plants can be attributed to the genetic improvement of the crop. Although the breeding technology and undergirding science are sound, additional information on the biochemical pathways underlying agronomic and quality traits and their genetic control would allow new genetic technologies to be used more fully. Current developments in molecular biology, plant cell and tissue culture, genetic engineering, and use of molecular genetics will facilitate the selection of complex traits. Genetic improvement of plants in the future will be based on an integration of modern plant-breeding methods and the new genetic technologies. Thus, the new genetic approaches do not represent a replacement technology but will add to the arsenal of tools available for improving crops. 3aplant breeding 3agenetic improvement 3afood quality 3agenetic engineering 3afood biotechnology0 tAmerican journal of clinical nutrition.g1993 Aug., v. 58, no. 2S p.259S-263Sx0002-91657nnas  aDNAL  a19940907b19940913c00000000  aINDdHBI  aOther US 7aarticle02281naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001500110245003800125300001800163500015200181500011600333520117200449650001301621650002501634650001701659650001201676650001901688650001801707653002301725653002801748773009901776852000901875930003301884945001301917946001301930655001201943IND2040754120221119230505.0940708e199403  mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204075412DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVessby, B.10aDietary carbohydrates in diabetes  ap. 742S-746S.  aIn the Special Issue: Carbohydrates in human nutrition: The importance of food choice, especially in a high-carbohydrate diet / edited by N.G. Asp.  aProceedings of the Swedish Nutrition Foundation's 18th International Symposium, May 19-22, 1992, Ystad, Sweden.  aRecent recommendations for dietary treatment of diabetes mellitus aim at a diet low in fat and rich in carbohydrates and dietary fiber. The main rationale for an increase of carbohydrates is the desire to reduce the content of fat, especially saturated fatty acids, without a concomitant increase of dietary protein. There are also indications that an increase of carbohydrate-rich foodstuffs can contribute to an improved metabolic profile. Not only the type of food but also its structure is of importance for the blood glucose and hormone responses after a meal. A diet containing approximately 55% of energy from carbohydrates (corresponding to less than or equal to 30% of energy from fat) with a modest increase of dietary fiber to greater than or equal to 3 g/MJ, concentrating on soluble fiber and starch-rich foods with a low glycemic index, will probably be adequate for most patients with diabetes. However, diets with somewhat higher or lower contents of carbohydrates may be more suitable for some patients because dietary advice should always be individualized on the basis of energy requirements, age, metabolic profile, and food habits of the patient. 3adiabetes 3adietary carbohydrate 3adiet therapy 3asucrose 3aexchange lists 3adietary fiber 0aliterature reviews 0acarbohydrate-rich foods0 tAmerican journal of clinical nutrition.g1994 Mar., v. 59, no. 3S p.742S-746Sx0002-91657nnas  aDNAL  a19940802b19940811c00000000  aINDdHBI  aOther US 7aarticle03827naa a2200685 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003800111040001800149072000900167072000900176100001800185245013200203300001600335500002400351520148700375650001101862650002001873650004801893650002101941650001301962650002001975650001101995650001802006650001802024650001602042650001302058650002702071650001902098650001902117650001702136650005202153650001202205650004902217650006602266650001102332650005502343650004402398650002302442650002802465650002502493650006002518650005602578650003702634650005502671653003902726700002202765700002602787700001902813700001902832773011202851852000902963856008802972930003303060945002503093946001103118655001203129IND4438397620221119230642.0100611e201007  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443839762DNAL7 a201939672pmid7 a10.1016/j.vetimm.2010.02.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL832 0aL8101 aPlatt, Ratree10aEvaluation of the cell-mediated immune response to reduced doses of Mycobacterium avium ssp. paratuberculosis vaccine in cattle  ap. 122-126.  aIncludes references  aVaccination against Johne's disease with an inactivated, oil-adjuvanted Mycobacterium avium ssp. paratuberculosis (MAP) bacterin can reduce clinical signs in infected herds; however, the development of indurated swelling at the injection site limits vaccine acceptability to producers. This study determined whether a reduced dose of vaccine antigen, with a full dose of adjuvant, would produce comparable T cell-mediated immune responses with smaller lesions. T cell responses induced by in vitro stimulation with MAP antigen from calves vaccinated with full, half, and quarter doses of antigen were evaluated 2, 4, and 9 months after vaccination by multi-parameter flow cytometry (FCM) and the whole blood interferon-γ (WB IFN-γ) assay. The WB IFN-γ responses were significantly elevated in vaccinated animals, but did not differ significantly between doses. FCM demonstrated antigen-specific responses for both IFN-γ and IL-4 in the CD4 T cell population from vaccinated animals, while CD8 T cells and γδ T cells mainly responded with increased IFN-γ. Dose may have affected some T cell subset parameters at some time points, but intradermal skin test responses, WB IFN-γ production, IFN-γ responses by T cell subsets in FCM were not significantly different between full, half, or quarter doses of antigen. Injection site lesions were smaller in animals vaccinated with a lower dose of antigen, but reached statistical significance (P <0.05) in the half dose group only. 3acattle 3acattle diseases 3aMycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis 3aparatuberculosis 3avaccines 3aimmune response 3adosage 3aT-lymphocytes 3adose response 3ainterferons 3aantigens 3acell-mediated immunity 3aflow cytometry 3ainjection site 3askin lesions 2aAdjuvants, Immunologicxadministration & dosage 2aAnimals 2aAntigens, Bacterialxadministration & dosage 2aBacterial Vaccinesxadministration & dosagexadverse effects. 2aCattle 2aCattle Diseasesximmunologyxprevention & control. 2aDose-Response Relationship, Immunologic 2aImmunity, Cellular 2aInterferon-gammaxblood 2aInterleukin-4xblood 2aMycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosisximmunology 2aParatuberculosisximmunologyxprevention & control. 2aT-Lymphocyte Subsetsximmunology 2aVaccinationxadverse effectsxmethodsxveterinary. 0awhole blood interferon-gamma assay1 aThoen, Charles O.1 aStalberger, Robert J.1 aChiang, Yu-Wei1 aRoth, James A.0 tVeterinary immunology and immunopathology.g2010 July, v. 136, no. 1-2 p.122-126dElsevierx0165-24277nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vetimm.2010.02.0033Available from publisher's Web site  a20100907b20101001c00000000  aINDd6CTe2010/07/26  aNon-US 7aarticle02390naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245004300126300001800169500001500187520137500202650001201577650001001589650002301599650001101622650001801633650001301651650001501664650001901679650001601698650001801714653001701732653002201749653002401771653001101795700001601806773009201822852000901914930003301923945001301956946001101969655001201980IND2060169620221119230206.0971017e199612  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND206016962DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSmith, D.M.10aMeasurement of sap flow in plant stems  ap. 1833-1844.  a2019-12-05  aTranspiration rates for whole plants, individual branches or tillers can be determined by techniques which measure the rate at which sap ascends stems. All of these methods use heat as a tracer for sap movement, but they are fundamentally different in their operating principles. Two methods commonly employed, the stem heat balance and trunk sector heat balance methods, use the heat balance principle; the stem is heated electrically and the heat balance is solved for the amount of heat taken up by the moving sap stream, which is then used to calculate the mass flow of sap in the stem. In the heat-pulse method, rather than using continuous heating, short pulses of heat are applied and the mass flow of sap is determined from the velocity of the heat pulses moving along the stem. In addition, rates of sap flow can be determined empirically, using the thermal dissipation technique, from the temperature of sapwood near a continuously-powered heater implanted in the stem. Users must understand the theory underlying each of these methods, so that they can select the method most appropriate to their application and take precautions against potential sources of error. When attempting to estimate transpiration by stands of vegetation from measurements of sap flow in individual plants, users must also select an appropriate sampling strategy and scaling method. 3asapwood 3astems 3aprobes (equipment) 3agauges 3atranspiration 3asap flow 3atree trunk 3aheat treatment 3ameasurement 3aheat transfer 0aheat balance 0astem heat balance 0aheat pulse velocity 0aplants1 aAllen, S.J.0 tJournal of experimental botany.g1996 Dec., v. 47, no. 305 p.1833-1844x0022-09577nnas  aDNAL  a19971102b19971106c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US 7aarticle02496naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001700128245009400145300001800239300002300257520090100280650001301181650001901194650002101213650002001234650001701254650001401271650001501285650001801300650002101318650002901339650004001368650003601408650002001444650003301464650001301497650002901510650002501539650002301564650002501587650003101612650002501643650002601668650002301694650001301717700001801730700001801748700001701766700001801783773007401801852000901875930003301884946001301917655001201930IND8806498220221119230147.0881228e19881125xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND880649822DNAL7 a30553012pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSpirin, A.S.12aA continuous cell-free translation system capable of producing polypeptides in high yield  ap. 1162-1164.  ap. 1162-1164. ill.  aA cell-free translation system has been constructed that uses a continuous flow of the feeding buffer [including amino acids, adenosine triphosphate (ATP), and guanosine triphosphate (GTP)] through the reaction mixture and a continuous removal of a polypeptide product. Both prokaryotic (Escherichia coli) and eukaryotic (wheat embryos, Triticum sp.) versions of the system have been tested. In both cases the system has proven active for long times, synthesizing polypeptides at a high constant rate for tens of hours. With the use of MS2 phage RNA or brome mosaic virus RNA4 as templates, 100 copies of viral coat proteins per RNA were synthesized for 20 hours in the prokaryotic or eukaryotic system, respectively. With synthetic calcitonin messenger RNA, 150 to 300 copies of calcitonin polypeptide were produced per messenger RNA in both types of continuous translation systems for 40 hours. 3aTriticum 3aembryo (plant) 3aEscherichia coli 3agene expression 3apolypeptides 3asynthesis 3acalcitonin 3amessenger RNA 3aeukaryotic cells 2aBacteriophagesxgenetics 2aCalcitoninxbiosynthesisxgenetics. 2aCapsidxbiosynthesisxgenetics. 2aElectrophoresis 2aEscherichia colixmetabolism 2aKinetics 2aMosaic Virusesxgenetics 2aPeptide Biosynthesis 2aPlantsxmetabolism 2aProtein Biosynthesis 2aRNA, Messengerxmetabolism 2aRNA, Viralxgenetics 2aRibosomesxmetabolism 2aTemplates, Genetic 2aTriticum1 aBaranov, V.I.1 aRyabova, L.A.1 aOvodov, S.Y.1 aAlakhov, Y.B.0 tScience.g1988 Nov. 25, v. 242, no. 4882 p.1162-1164x0036-80757nnas  aDNAL  a20060204b00000000c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02366naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024004200133040001800175100002000193245006800213300001800281520098300299650001401282650001201296650002501308650001601333650001101349650002101360650002801381650002001409650006701429653001501496653001401511653000901525653000901534653000901543653000901552653002601561653001801587653001001605700001801615773010601633852000901739856009201748930003301840946001101873655001201884IND4412799520221119230707.0081121e200812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441279952DNAL7 a188010622pmid7 aPMC27668642pmcid7 a10.1111/j.1600-0854.2008.00834.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGrant, Barth D.10aMechanisms of EHD/RME-1 Protein Function in Endocytic Transport  ap. 2043-2052.  aThe evolutionarily conserved Eps15 homology domain (EHD)/receptor-mediated endocytosis (RME)-1 family of C-terminal EH domain proteins has recently come under intense scrutiny because of its importance in intracellular membrane transport, especially with regard to the recycling of receptors from endosomes to the plasma membrane. Recent studies have shed new light on the mode by which these adenosine triphosphatases function on endosomal membranes in mammals and Caenorhabditis elegans. This review highlights our current understanding of the physiological roles of these proteins in vivo, discussing conserved features as well as emerging functional differences between individual mammalian paralogs. In addition, these findings are discussed in light of the identification of novel EHD/RME-1 protein and lipid interactions and new structural data for proteins in this family, indicating intriguing similarities to the Dynamin superfamily of large guanosine triphosphatases. 3arecycling 2aAnimals 2aBiological Transport 2aEndocytosis 2aHumans 2aLipid Metabolism 2aNucleotidesxmetabolism 2aProtein Binding 2aVesicular Transport Proteinsxchemistryxgeneticsxmetabolism. 0aC. elegans 0aEH domain 0aEHD1 0aEHD2 0aEHD3 0aEHD4 0aendocytic trafficking 0aRab effectors 0aRME-11 aCaplan, Steve0 tTraffic.g2008 Dec., v. 9, no. 12 p.2043-2052dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx1398-92197nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1600-0854.2008.00834.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20081121b20081206c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle01631naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002200110245011700132300001800249500001500267520060700282650001500889650004100904650000700945650001400952650002500966650002000991650004301011653001101054653001501065653001401080700001701094773009201111852000901203930003301212945001301245946001101258655001201269IND2063211720221119230809.0980417e199708  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND206321172DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVashakmadze, G.S.10aTomato vesicles as a model system for studying in situ activity of 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid oxidase  ap. 1525-1528.  a2019-12-05  aA model system is described which could be used for the study of ACC oxidase in vivo.

This system has been used to demonstrate the presence of an inhibitor(s) of ACC oxidase activity in the locular juice and also to study the effects of ionophores and uncouplers on the in vivo enzyme activity. 3aorganelles 3aaminocyclopropanecarboxylate oxidase 3apH 3apotassium 3ametabolic inhibitors 3aenzyme activity 3aSolanum lycopersicum var. lycopersicum 0afruits 0aoxygenases 0aisolation1 aTucker, G.A.0 tJournal of experimental botany.g1997 Aug., v. 48, no. 313 p.1525-1528x0022-09577nnas  aDNAL  a19980531b19980605c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US 7aarticle02955naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100002000171245006200191300001800253520127200271650002801543650001001571650002201581650001301603650003701616650001401653650003901667650002201706650002201728650003901750650002701789650001501816650002801831650006101859650008101920650002302001651001102024651002602035653000902061653000802070700001902078700001502097700001902112700001802131773013102149852000902280856009202289930003302381946001102414655001202425IND4412798420221119230538.0081121e200812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441279842DNAL7 a191206652pmid7 a10.1111/j.1365-2672.2008.03964.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEllingsen, A.B.10aGenetic diversity among Norwegian Vibrio parahaemolyticus  ap. 2195-2202.  aTo examine the variability among environmental Vibrio parahaemolyticus (including trh+ isolates) from Norway, and to compare these to clinical isolates and isolates from imported foods. A total of 246 V. parahaemolyticus were successfully digested with NotI, and the fragments were separated by pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). The isolates could be divided into 72 clusters and 103 pulsotypes. Eleven clusters contained 4-31 environmental isolates, and the isolates within these clusters greatly varied with respect to origin. None of the trh+ and /or tdh+ isolates clustered with trh-/tdh- isolates. The trh+ environmental isolates included in the study belonged to two separate clusters. A subset of isolates was serotyped, and great serotype diversity was observed among the environmental V. parahaemolyticus. The clinical isolates included O3:K6 and O3:KUT, and these were identical or related to a pandemic reference strain by PFGE. Environmental V. parahaemolyticus (including trh+) were genetically diverse, but certain variants occurred throughout the coastal environment, and some were persistent over time. Although trh+ V. parahaemolyticus persisted in the Norwegian environment, no evidence indicated that indigenous isolates have caused disease. 3aVibrio parahaemolyticus 3afoods 3agenetic variation 3apandemic 3apulsed-field gel electrophoresis 3aserotypes 2aElectrophoresis, Gel, Pulsed-Field 2aFood Microbiology 2aGenetic Variation 2aPolymerase Chain Reactionxmethods 2aSeawaterxmicrobiology 2aSerotyping 2aShellfishxmicrobiology 2aVibrio Infectionsxepidemiologyxgeneticsxmicrobiology. 2aVibrio parahaemolyticusxclassificationxgeneticsxisolation & purification. 2aWater Microbiology 3aNorway 0aNorwayxepidemiology. 0aPFGE 0atrh1 aJørgensen, H.1 aWagley, S.1 aMonshaugen, M.1 aRørvik, L.M.0 tJournal of applied microbiology.g2008 Dec., v. 105, no. 6 p.2195-2202dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx1364-50727nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2672.2008.03964.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20081121b20081206c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03502naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001800110245005500128300001800183500001500201520249500216650001902711650001402730650002602744650001102770650002302781650001002804650001202814650002202826653001602848653002302864653001102887653001802898700001602916700001402932773009202946852000903038930003303047945001303080946001103093655001203104IND2063211320221119230725.0980417e199708  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND206321132DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDodeman, V.L.10aZygotic embryogenesis versus somatic embryogenesis  ap. 1493-1509.  a2019-12-05  aThis review will summarize molecular and genetic analyses aimed at identifying the mechanisms underlying the sequence of events during plant zygotic embryogenesis. These events are being studied in parallel with the histological and morphological analyses of somatic embryogenesis. The strength and limitations of somatic embryogenesis as a model system will be discussed briefly. The formation of the zygotic embryo has been described in some detail, but the molecular mechanisms controlling the differentiation of the various cell types are not understood. In recent years plant molecular and genetic studies have led to the identification and characterization of genes controlling the establishment of polarity, tissue differentiation and elaboration of patterns during embryo development. An investigation of the developmental basis of a number of mutant phenotypes has enabled the identification of gene activities promoting (1) asymmetric cell division and polarization leading to heterogeneous partitioning of the cytoplasmic determinants necessary for the initiation of embryogenesis (e.g. GNOM), (2) the determination of the apical-basal organization which is established independently of the differentiation of the tissues of the radial pattern elements (e.g. KNOLLE, FACKEL, ZWILLE), (3) the differentiation of meristems (e.g. SHOOT-MERISTEMLESS), and (4) the formation of a mature embryo characterized by the accumulation of LEA and storage proteins. The accumulation of these two types of proteins is controlled by ABA-dependent regulatory mechanisms as shown using both ABA-deficient and ABA-insensitive mutants (e.g. ABA, ABI3). Both types of embryogenesis have been studied by different techniques and common features have been identified between them. In spite of the relative difficulty of identifying the original cells involved in the developmental processes of somatic embryogenesis, common regulatory mechanisms are probably involved in the first stages up to the globular form. Signal molecules, such as growth regulators, have been shown to play a role during development of both types of embryos. The most promising method for identifying regulatory mechanisms responsible for the key events of embryogenesis will come from molecular and genetic analyses. The mutations already identified will shed light on the nature of the genes that affect developmental processes as well as elucidating the role of the various regulatory genes that control plant embryogenesis. 3aembryo (plant) 3ameristems 3asomatic embryogenesis 3azygote 3amolecular genetics 3agenes 3amutants 3amolecular biology 0acomparisons 0aliterature reviews 0aplants 0aembryogenesis1 aDucreux, G.1 aKreis, M.0 tJournal of experimental botany.g1997 Aug., v. 48, no. 313 p.1493-1509x0022-09577nnas  aDNAL  a19980531b19980605c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US 7aarticle02585naa a2200625 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100002000128245009600148300001600244520099200260650000901252650003201261650001701293650001701310650002201327650002101349650001601370650001301386650001101399650001001410650001501420650001001435650001601445650000901461650002501470650001801495650001001513650002101523650000901544650003201553650001101585650001101596650001101607650000901618650001601627650002101643651001101664651001101675700001501686700001801701700001701719700001301736700001701749700001701766773009601783852000901879930003301888945001301921946001301934655001201947IND2040375120221119230543.0940620e199402  mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204037512DNAL7 a83109892pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aParkinson, A.J.10aElevated concentrations of plasma omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids among Alaskan Eskimos  ap. 384-388.  aEskimos living in rural southwestern Alaska depend on fish and marine mammals as major sources of subsistence food.

There was no increase in the mean bleeding times of Native participants of either village. 3adiet 3apolyunsaturated fatty acids 3ablood plasma 3ablood lipids 3ablood coagulation 3afood consumption 3arural areas 3achildren 3aadults 3aInuit 2aAdolescent 2aAdult 2aAge Factors 2aAged 2aAnalysis of Variance 2aBleeding Time 2aChild 2aChild, Preschool 2aDiet 2aFatty Acids, Omega-3xblood 2aFemale 2aHumans 2aInuit. 2aMale 2aMiddle Aged 2aRural Population 3aAlaska 0aAlaska1 aCruz, A.L.1 aHeyward, W.L.1 aBulkow, L.R.1 aHall, D.1 aBarstaed, L.1 aConnor, W.E.0 tAmerican journal of clinical nutrition.g1994 Feb., v. 59, no. 2 p.384-388x0002-91657nnas  aDNAL  a19940720b19940722c00000000  aINDdHBI  aOther US 7aarticle03014naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001900152245009100171300001600262520169600278650001701974650002301991650001502014650001602029650001702045650001602062650002102078650001902099650002302118650002002141650002502161650002602186653003002212653002102242653002802263700002202291773013402313852000902447856009202456930003302548946001102581655001202592IND4412804720221119230855.0081121e200812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441280472DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1467-2979.2008.00299.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHauser, Lorenz10aParadigm shifts in marine fisheries genetics: ugly hypotheses slain by beautiful facts  ap. 333-362.  aBy providing new approaches to the investigation of demographic and evolutionary dynamics of wild populations, molecular genetics has led to fundamental changes in our understanding of marine ecology. In particular, genetic approaches have revolutionized our understanding in three areas: (i) most importantly, they have contributed to the discovery of extensive genetic population structure in many marine species, overturning the notion of large, essentially homogenous marine populations limiting local adaptation and speciation. (ii) Concomitant differences in ecologically important traits now indicate extensive adaptive differentiation and biocomplexity, potentially increasing the resilience to exploitation and disturbance. Evidence for rapid adaptive change in many populations underlies recent concerns about fisheries-induced evolution affecting life-history traits. (iii) A compilation of recent published research shows estimated effective population sizes that are 2-6 orders of magnitude smaller than census sizes, suggesting more complex recruitment dynamics in marine species than previously assumed. Studies on Atlantic cod are used to illustrate these paradigm shifts. In our synthesis, we emphasize the implications of these discoveries for marine ecology and evolution as well as the management and conservation of exploited marine fish populations. An important implication of genetic structuring and the potential for adaptive divergence is that locally adapted populations are unlikely to be replaced through immigration, with potentially detrimental consequences for the resilience to environmental change - a key consideration for sustainable fisheries management. 3aGadus morhua 3aadaptive radiation 3acod (fish) 3aimmigration 3alife history 3amarine fish 3amarine fisheries 3amarine science 3amolecular genetics 3apopulation size 3apopulation structure 3asustainable fisheries 0aeffective population size 0alocal adaptation 0apopulation connectivity1 aCarvalho, Gary R.0 tFish and fisheries.g2008 Dec., v. 9, no. 4 p.333-362dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing LtdwJournal:jnl3867077x1467-29607nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1467-2979.2008.00299.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20081121b20081206c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle01539naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001600148245005900164300001600223520065500239650001700894650002000911650001200931650001300943650002900956700001500985773020301000856004901203852000901252655001201261IND60635597420221119230944.0190402e200508  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063559742DNAL7 a10.1623/hysj.2005.50.4.6052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBayazit, M.10aProbabilities and return periods of multisite droughts  ap. 605-615.  aBecause droughts cover extensive areas, it is important to consider multisite droughts in a region. Probability distribution of joint droughts at a number of sites is derived assuming that flows are cross-correlated first-order Markov processes. A geometric distribution is found with a parameter that depends on the threshold probability, lag-one autocorrelation coefficients, and the multivariate probability of remaining below the threshold. Computation of the parameter of the geometric distribution is discussed. An expression is obtained for the return period of multisite droughts. Application of the derived expression is shown in an example. 3aMarkov chain 3aautocorrelation 3adrought 3ageometry 3aprobability distribution1 aÖnöz, B.0 tHydrological sciences journal.g2005, v. 50, no. 4 p.605-615dPublished for the International Association of Hydrological Sciences by Blackwell Scientific PublicationswJournal:2013x0262-66677nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1623/hysj.2005.50.4.605  aDNAL 7aarticle02656naa a2200301 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002200110245012600132300001600258500001500274520176200289650001802051650000902069650002202078650001402100650001402114653002702128653001602155700001902171773009902190852000902289939003302298946001102331655001202342IND9303029220221119230811.0930518e199212  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND930302922DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShukolyukov, S.A.10aOpsin biosynthesis and trans-cis isomerization of aldehyde form chromosphore in the blowfly Calliphora erythrocephala eye  ap. 925-935.  a2019-12-04  aThe effect of eye carotenoid content, light conditions and retinoid supply on the biosynthesis of opsin, as well as the ability to isomerize of exogenous all-trans-retinal to 11-cis-retinal were investigated in the photoreceptors of blowfly Calliphora. SDS-PAGE of digitonin extracts from isolated rhabdom fractions of carotenoid-fortified and carotenoid-deficient animals revealed, on heavily loaded gels, that in both cases opsin forms faint minor bands similar to the patterns of "R(-)-flies" described as "vitamin A-deficient flies" (Paulsen and Schwemer, Biochim. biophys Acta 557, 358-390, 1979) or "carotenoid-deficient flies" (Paulsen and Schwemer, Eur. J. Biochem. 137, 609-614, 1983). Similar opsin patterns were obtained in flies subjected to continuous 72 h blue or yellow-green light or to a 12 h:12 h white light:dark cycle, or total darkness, irrespective of the carotenoid content in their eyes. 11-cis-retinal and, to a lesser extent, all-trans-retinal, when included in the diet or painted on the cornea, were found to stimulate opsin biosynthesis in the dark. 11-cis-retinal in the dark or all-trans-retinal after illumination of the flies with blue light were the most effective, as compared with the effect of all-trans-retinal in the dark. Exogenous all-trans-retinal in the dark can be partially converted into a mixture of 11-cis-retinal (26%) and 13-cis-retinal (approximately 74%) by fly retina homogenate in vitro. It was concluded that Calliphora opsin biosynthesis is not strongly dependent on the carotenoid supply or on light:dark conditions and is triggered by the 11-cis aldehyde form of the chromophore, which can be produced in the fly retina either by an isomerase system in the dark or as a result of photoisomerization. 3aisomerization 3aeyes 3aCalliphora vicina 3aretinoids 3aaldehydes 0achromophore precursors 0acarotenoids1 aDenisova, N.A.0 tInsect biochemistry and molecular biology.g1992 Dec., v. 22, no. 8 p.925-935x0965-17487nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03394naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001900152245006300171300001600234520195000250650001502200650001402215650001702229650002502246650001602271650001302287650001402300650001602314650001202330650001702342650001002359650001302369650002202382650001502404650001302419650000902432650001202441650000902453650001502462650001202477650002202489650000902511651001202520651001102532653001802543653001502561773013102576852000902707856009202716930003302808946001102841655001202852IND4412810320221119230936.0081121e200811  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441281032DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1748-5967.2008.00175.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYANG, Man-Miao10aInsects in expanding education and entertainment in Taiwan  ap. S57-S65.  aTaiwan, an island of approximately 36000 km² area, includes stunning diversity in both habitat and biota because of its transitional position. Where the Tropic of Cancer cuts across the middle of the island and the east Philippine plate subducts into the Eurasia plate, the landscape and weather are extremely congenial for a highly diverse biota to develop over the years in Taiwan. Such a natural endowment has enabled diverse habitats for wildlife to evolve. Insects are especially abundant in Taiwan. For example, about 400 species of butterflies occur in Taiwan. Export of aesthetically attractive insects, such as butterflies and beetles, is an ongoing key industry in Taiwan right from the early to middle 20th century. As the economic preferences moved towards high technology with a concurrent understanding of biological diversity and the concept of conservation grew strong, use of insect materials have currently moved towards education and entertainment. Besides the exhibition of traditional methods of insect collection, several newly developed insectaria are presently integrated into Taiwanese museums, zoos, and university departments using modern technology for displaying activities of live insects. Summer camps offer plentiful opportunities for children to learn about insects. Volunteers, with appropriate research skills and extensive scientific knowledge are involved in these exhibitions. Rearing of "pet" insects is popular and, consequently, enabled the growth of some specific supply companies. Traditionally, insect resources are used in many aspects, such as in medicine and food and extraction of insect products such as silk and honey; occasionally some of the insects are useful as even game animals. Fighting crickets provide entertainment, and occasionally used in gambling as well. Insects provide diverse and abundant resources and are an excellent material deserved for better exploration in many aspects. 3aColeoptera 3aGryllidae 3abiodiversity 3abusiness enterprises 3abutterflies 3achildren 3aeducation 3aexhibitions 3aexports 3agame animals 3ahoney 3aindustry 3ainsect collection 3alandscapes 3amedicine 3apets 3arearing 3asilk 3avolunteers 3aweather 3awildlife habitats 3azoos 3aEurasia 3aTaiwan 0aentertainment 0ainsectaria0 tEntomological research.g2008 Nov., v. 38, no. s1 p.S57-S65dMelbourne, Australia : Blackwell Publishing Asiax1738-22977nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1748-5967.2008.00175.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20081121b20081206c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02398naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245015400127300001800281500001500299520119100314650004001505650003501545650002001580650001401600650002001614650003601634650001101670653005001681653001101731653002901742653002901771653001601800653001001816700001601826773009201842852000901934930003301943945001301976946001101989655001202000IND2063213520221119230708.0980417e199708  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND206321352DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOlesen, J.E.10aEffects of temperature and irradiance on vegetative growth of cauliflower (Brassica oleracea L. botrytis) and broccoli (Brassica oleracea L. italica)  ap. 1591-1598.  a2019-12-05  aCauliflower (Brassica oleracea L. botrytis) and broccoli (Brassica oleracea L. italica) plants were grown in large pots in growth chambers for a range of temperatures (mean air temperatures from 7.0-25.3 degrees C) and irradiances (from 9.3-50.8 mol m-2 d-1 or 4.7-25.4 MJ m-2 d-1) The extinction coefficient for PAR decreased with plant size reaching a value of 0.55 in cauliflower and 0.45 in broccoli at plant leaf areas of 0.235 m2 and 0.227 m2, respectively. The leaf area expansion rate was unaffected by irradiance when compared at identical leaf surface temperatures. The response of expansion rate to surface temperature was fitted to a bmken stick model with a base temperature of -0.7 degrees C and an optimum temperature of 21.0 degrees C. The radiation conversion coefficient increased with air temperature below 13.8 degrees C and remained constant above this. The estimated radiation conversion coefficient above 13.8 degrees C and for a PPFD of 20 mol m-2 d-1 was 0.77 g mol-1 in cauliflower and 0.879 mol -1 in broccoli.

A 14-d-old daughter cladode was a sink organ with a negative daily net CO2 uptake; its water potential was higher than that of the underlying basal cladode, implicating a non-xylem pathway for the water needed for growth. Indeed, the relatively dilute phloem sap (7.44% dry weight) of a basal cladode can supply all the water (7.1 g d-1) along with photosynthate needed for the growth of a 14-d-old daughter cladode; about 3% of the imported water flowed back to the basal cladode via the xylem. In contrast, a 28-d-old daughter cladode was a source organ whose water potential was lower than that of its basal cladode, so the xylem can supply the water needed (25.7 g d-1) for its growth; about 6% of the imported water flowed back to the basal cladode along with photosynthate via the phloem. The phloem tracer carboxyfluorescein occurred in the phloem of 14-d-old daughter cladodes after its precursor was applied to basal cladodes. When applied to basal cladodes, the apoplastic tracers sulphorhodamine G (SR) and trisodium 8-hydroxy-1,3,6-pyrenetrisulphonate (PTS) failed to move into 14-d-old daughter cladodes within 5 h, but moved into 28-d-old daughter cladodes within 2 h. SR and PTS moved into basal cladodes within 2 h when applied to 14-d-old daughter cladodes, but not within 5-6 h when applied to 28-d-old daughter cladodes. The tracer experiments therefore confirmed the patterns of water flow determined using water and carbon budgets. 3aOpuntia ficus-indica 3astems 3aage 3asource-sink relationships 3aphloem 3axylem 3awater flow 3asap 3aphotosynthesis 3acarbon dioxide 3agas exchange 3atranspiration 3atranslocation (plant physiology) 3awater potential 3aphotosynthates 0afluorescent tracers 0awater transfer1 aZhang, H.H.1 aNobel, P.S.0 tJournal of experimental botany.g1997 Mar., v. 48, no. 308 p.675-682x0022-09577nnas  aDNAL  a19971201b19971208c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US 7aarticle04079naa a2200649 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100001500171245018700186300001600373520186000389650002302249650001502272650001002287650000902297650002202306650005402328650004002382650006502422650006302487650002402550650003302574650003902607650004502646650001102691650003902702650000902741650005302750650001602803650003802819650001702857650002202874650001602896651001102912651001802923653001702941653001402958653003702972653002903009700001303038700001703051700001303068700001203081700001703093700001303110700002203123773012703145852000903272856009203281930003303373946001103406655001203417IND4432318120221119230850.0100205e201003  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443231812DNAL7 a201519972pmid7 a10.1111/j.1463-1326.2009.01152.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aConard, S.10aEzetimibe added to atorvastatin compared with doubling the atorvastatin dose in patients at high risk for coronary heart disease with diabetes mellitus, metabolic syndrome or neither  ap. 210-218.  aAim: Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and metabolic syndrome (MetS) are both associated with increased risk for atherosclerotic coronary heart disease (CHD). Thus, it is useful to know the relative efficacy of lipid-altering drugs in these patient populations. Methods: A double-blind, parallel group trial of adult patients with hypercholesterolaemia at high-CHD risk receiving atorvastatin 40 mg/day compared atorvastatin 40 mg plus ezetimibe 10 mg (ezetimibe) vs. doubling atorvastatin to 80 mg. This post hoc analysis reports lipid efficacy results in patients grouped by diagnosis of T2DM, MetS without T2DM or neither. Per cent change from baseline at week 6 was assessed for LDL-C, total cholesterol, HDL-C , non-HDL-C , Apo A-I, Apo B and triglycerides. Safety was monitored through clinical and laboratory adverse events (AEs). Results: Compared with doubling atorvastatin, atorvastatin plus ezetimibe resulted in greater reductions in LDL-C, triglycerides, Apo B, non-HDL-C, total cholesterol and lipid ratios in the T2DM, MetS and neither groups. Treatment effects were of similar magnitude across patient groups with both treatments, except triglycerides, which were slightly greater in the T2DM and MetS groups vs. neither group. Changes in HDL-C , Apo A-I and high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) were comparable for both treatments in all three groups. Safety and tolerability profiles were generally similar between treatments and across patient groups, as were the incidence of liver and muscle AEs. Conclusions: Compared with doubling atorvastatin to 80 mg, addition of ezetimibe to atorvastatin 40 mg produced greater improvements in multiple lipid parameters in high-CHD risk patients with T2DM, MetS or neither, consistent with the significantly greater changes observed in the full study cohort (clinical trial # NCT00276484). 3ametabolic syndrome 2aAdolescent 2aAdult 2aAged 2aAged, 80 and over 2aAnticholesteremic Agentsxadministration & dosage 2aAzetidinesxadministration & dosage 2aCoronary Artery Diseasexdrug therapyxprevention & control. 2aDiabetic Angiopathiesxdrug therapyxprevention & control. 2aDouble-Blind Method 2aDrug Administration Schedule 2aDrug Therapy, Combinationxmethods 2aHeptanoic Acidsxadministration & dosage 2aHumans 2aHypercholesterolemiaxdrug therapy 2aMale 2aMetabolic Syndromexcomplicationsxdrug therapy. 2aMiddle Aged 2aPyrrolesxadministration & dosage 2aRisk Factors 2aTreatment Outcome 2aYoung Adult 0aCanada 0aUnited States 0aatorvastatin 0aezetimibe 0ahigh coronary heart disease risk 0atype 2 diabetes mellitus1 aBays, H.1 aLeiter, L.A.1 aBird, S.1 aLin, J.1 aHanson, M.E.1 aShah, A.1 aTershakovec, A.M.0 tDiabetes, obesity & metabolism.g2010 Mar., v. 12, no. 3 p.210-218dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx1462-89027nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1463-1326.2009.01152.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20100205b20100305c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02360naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001400110245009700124300001600221500001500237520124400252650001501496650001801511650001601529650001801545650001001563650002501573650001901598650001201617650001401629650001801643650001401661650001701675653001001692653001801702653001401720700001801734700001801752773009001770852000901860930003301869945001301902946001101915655001201926IND2060574120221119230820.0971118e199703  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND206057412DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHou, J.Q.10aWater uptake and distribution in non-dormant and dormant wild oat (Avena fatua L.) caryopses  ap. 683-692.  a2019-12-05  aThe influence of seed coat modification and light quality on water uptake and distribution in caryopses of dormant and non-dormant lines of wild oat (Avena fatua L.) was determined using NMR microimaging. Non-dormant seeds absorbed water more rapidly than dormant seeds during imbibition on distilled water. This effect was detected first in the embryo-scutellar region (8 h) and later in the proximal endosperm (12 h). Cutting the testa and pericarp close to the embryo or scarification with KOH promoted rapid embryo/scutellum hydration and germination. Cutting at the middle part of the caryopsis did not enhance embryo hydration nor did it greatly improve germination. The sensitivity of water distribution to the phytochrome germination effect was examined. Significant differences in imbibitional water uptake by embryo-scutellum tissue were detected by 18 h following redlight (germination promoter) compared with far-red (germination inhibitor) treatment. The results indicated that both the rate and the sequence of embryo/scutellum hydration were important in initiating germination in dormant seeds. A refinement of the model that describes water imbibition in wild oat seeds during the early stages of germination is discussed. 3aimbibition 3afar-red light 3aAvena fatua 3aseed dormancy 3atesta 3aspatial distribution 3aembryo (plant) 3acutting 3aendosperm 3awater content 3ared light 3awater uptake 0aseeds 0ascarification 0ascutellum1 aKendall, E.J.1 aSimpson, G.M.0 tJournal of experimental botany.g1997 Mar., v. 48, no. 308 p.683-692x0022-09577nnas  aDNAL  a19971201b19971208c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US 7aarticle02562naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001500110245008100125300001600206520141400222650001301636650002201649650002001671650001601691650001201707650002001719650001801739650001801757650002501775650001501800650001501815650002601830650002101856650001801877653001101895653002501906653002401931700001701955773009001972852000902062930003302071945001302104946001102117655001202128IND2060575320221119230828.0971118e199703  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND206057532DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDing, B.L.10aMetabolic involvement in acid-mediated extension growth of maize coleoptiles  ap. 721-728.  aThe acid-growth response (AGR) induced by acidic buffer (pH 4) in abraded maize (Zea mays L.) coleoptile segments can be completely inhibited within a few minutes by inhibitors of the haemoprotein function (KCN, Na-azide) or ionophores collapsing the proton gradients across membranes (carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenyl hydrazone, monensin). These substances also interfere with the acid-mediated increase in cell-wall extensibility measured with a constant-load extensiometer in vivo in turgid or non-turgid segments, but have no effect on the extensibility of the cell walls measured in vitro with frozen/thawed segments. The inhibitors do not cause an alkalinization of the apoplastic solution or a decrease in the osmotic pressure of the cell sap of acid-treated segments. In contrast, inhibitors of ATP synthesis (N,N'-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide, diethyistilbestrol), which arrest auxin-mediated growth in a similar way to KCN, have no effect on AGR. Removal of O2 inhibits growth at pH 4 by about 25%; the anoxia-insensitive part of the AGR can be fully inhibited by azide. Diminishing the membrane potential with valinomycin has no effect on AGR. It is concluded that the AGR is controlled by protoplastic functions, possibly localized in the plasma membrane, which are lost when the cells are killed. The isolated cell wall may not represent a sufficient model system for the biochemical mechanism of AGR. 3aZea mays 3aHelianthus annuus 3aCucumis sativus 3acoleoptiles 3aacidity 3aseedling growth 3ahydrogen ions 3aion transport 3ametabolic inhibitors 3aionophores 3acell walls 3amechanical properties 3aosmotic pressure 3aextensibility 0agrowth 0aacid growth response 0acell wall loosening1 aSchopfer, P.0 tJournal of experimental botany.g1997 Mar., v. 48, no. 308 p.721-728x0022-09577nnas  aDNAL  a19971201b19971208c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US 7aarticle04028naa a2200637 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146072000900164072000900173100002600182245016700208300001600375500002400391500001500415520187100430650001902301650002302320650001802343650001702361650002502378650001402403650001802417650002302435650002002458650004602478650001102524650001102535650007002546650001202616650002702628650004102655650003202696650006602728650002002794650002602814650002402840650005402864650002902918650003902947650003702986653001803023653002703041700002203068700002103090773010203111852000903213856008503222930003303307945002503340946001303365655001203378IND4433010220221119231021.0100220e201002  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443301022DNAL7 a201459802pmid7 a10.1007/s10886-010-9748-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF600 0aF8211 aStevenson, Philip C. 10aInactivation of Baculovirus by Isoflavonoids on Chickpea (Cicer arietinum) Leaf Surfaces Reduces the Efficacy of Nucleopolyhedrovirus Against Helicoverpa armigera  ap. 227-235.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aBiological pesticides based on nucleopolyhedroviruses (NPVs) can provide an effective and environmentally benign alternative to synthetic chemicals. On some crops, however, the efficacy and persistence of NPVs is known to be reduced by plant specific factors. The present study investigated the efficacy of Helicoverpa armigera NPV (HearNPV) for control of H. armigera larvae, and showed that chickpea reduced the infectivity of virus occlusion bodies (OBs) exposed to the leaf surface of chickpea for at least 1 h. The degree of inactivation was greater on chickpea than that previously reported on cotton, and the mode of action is different from that of cotton. The effect was observed for larvae that consumed OBs on chickpea leaves, but it also occurred when OBs were removed after exposure to plants and inoculated onto artificial diet, indicating that inhibition was leaf surface-related and permanent. Despite their profuse exudation from trichomes on chickpea leaves and their low pH, organic acids—primarily oxalic and malic acid—caused no inhibition. When HearNPV was incubated with biochanin A and sissotrin, however, two minor constituents of chickpea leaf extracts, OB activity was reduced significantly. These two isoflavonoids increased in concentration by up to 3 times within 1 h of spraying the virus suspension onto the plants and also when spraying only the carrier, indicating induction was in response to spraying and not a specific response to the HearNPV. Although inactivation by the isoflavonoids did not account completely for the level of effect recorded on whole plants, this work constitutes evidence for a novel mechanism of NPV inactivation in legumes. Expanding the use of biological pesticides on legume crops will be dependent upon the development of suitable formulations for OBs to overcome plant secondary chemical effects. 3ainsect viruses 3aviral insecticides 3aisoflavonoids 3ainactivation 3aHelicoverpa armigera 3achickpeas 3apathogenicity 3ainduced resistance 3aCicer arietinum 3aHelicoverpa armigera nucleopolyhedrovirus 3aleaves 3alarvae 2aAcids, Acyclicxanalysisxisolation & purificationxpharmacology. 2aAnimals 2aChemical Fractionation 2aChromatography, High Pressure Liquid 2aCicerxchemistryxvirology. 2aFlavonoidsxanalysisxisolation & purificationxpharmacology. 2aLarvaxvirology 2aLepidopteraxvirology 2aMethanolxchemistry 2aNucleopolyhedrovirusesxdrug effectsxphysiology. 2aPest Control, Biological 2aPlant Leavesxchemistryxvirology. 2aVirus Inactivationxdrug effects 0abiopesticides 0avirus occlusion bodies1 aD'Cunha, Reju F. 1 aGrzywacz, David 0 tJournal of chemical ecology.g2010 Feb., v. 36, no. 2 p.227-235dSpringer-Verlagx0098-03317nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10886-010-9748-83Available from publisher's Web site  a20100325b20100403c00000000  aINDdNZMe2010/03/25  aOther US 7aarticle02431naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001900128245013600147300001800283500001500301520092200316650001001238650001601248650001901264650002101283650002601304650001001330650002101340650002401361650001101385650001301396650002401409650001101433650001201444650002201456650001301478650005501491650006401546650003701610650002301647650006301670653000901733700001701742773009801759852000901857930003301866945001301899946001301912655001201925IND2044481920221119230837.0950207e199406  mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204448192DNAL7 a79110002pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAnderson, G.J.10aAccretion of n-3 fatty acids in the brain and retina of chicks fed a low-linolenic acid diet supplemented with docosahexaenoic acid  ap. 1338-1346.  a2019-12-05  aDiets low in alpha-linolenic acid may not support normal brain accretion of n-3 fatty acids.

Control chicks from soybean oil-fed hens were fed a soybean oil-based diet. The fatty acid composition of the chick brains, retinas, livers, and serum was determined after 0-4 wk. The corn oil diet did not reverse the deficiency but the combination of corn oil and docosahexaenoic acid rapidly restored brain and retinal concentrations of docosahexaenoic acid.

The heritability of within-population germination characteristics was therefore investigated for the oilseed rape cultivar Martina. Two groups of seed were selected from a batch of seeds germinated at 5 degrees C: those germinating up to about the 20th percentile, termed early germinators, and those above the 80th percentile, viable non-germinators, which did not germinate at 5 degrees C but did so subsequently when moved to a higher temperature. The groups of seeds were isolated, grown to flowering and the plants self-pollinated. Germination of the new seed from the two groups was then compared with seed from the original population at temperatures between 4 degrees C and 19 degrees C on a thermal plate. Differences between seed lots were small at 19 degrees C, but large below 10 degrees C. The differences in spread of time were analysed by fitting exponential curves to the non-linear relation of 1/time on temperature for each of five percentiles, 10, 20, 50, 80, and 90. The fitting procedure tested the extent to which variation within and between seed lots was caused by variation in the base temperature, the curvature of the relation and a parameter for scaling the curve between percentiles. Progeny of the early seed germinated much more rapidly than the original, and germinated completely even at low temperature. The more rapid germination was attributed to a lower extrapolated base temperature of -2.3 degrees C, compared to -0.7 degrees C for the original, and slightly greater curvature. Progeny of non-germinator seed contained a higher proportion of viable non-germinating seed (for example, 20% germination at 4 degrees C, compared to 50% for the original), but the germinating seed differed only slightly from the original in time to germination. Among the germinating percentiles, both types of progeny displayed less spread in time to germination than the original seed. It was concluded that the cultivar had the potential to give rise to genetically distinct populations able to exploit different seasonal opportunities. 3aBrassica napus 3aseed germination 3aair temperature 3aheritability 3agenotype-environment interaction 3aprogeny 0avariation 0aseed germination rate 0aseed germination time1 aMarshall, B.1 aDunlop, G.1 aWright, G.0 tJournal of experimental botany.g1997 Apr., v. 48, no. 309 p.869-875x0022-09577nnas  aDNAL  a19980201b19980206c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US 7aarticle02542naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001400128245008400142300001800226500001500244520101800259650002201277650002001299650002001319650001801339650002401357650001701381650001201398650001401410650002801424650007101452650001001523650000901533650001101542650001101553650000901564650002701573650005701600650001801657653002401675700002201699700001701721700001501738700001601753700001501769700001901784700001901803773009801822852000901920930003301929945001301962946001301975655001201988IND2044483020221119230620.0950207e199406  mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204448302DNAL7 a81980622pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBulux, J.10aPlasma response of children to short-term chronic beta-carotene supplementation  ap. 1369-1375.  a2019-12-05  aPlasma concentrations of beta-carotene and retinol after supplementation of children with beta-carotene in supplements and in foods were compared in Guatemalan children.

Regardless of the route, nutrition increased leucine appearance rate (Ra) and oxidation, stimulated protein synthesis, and improved leucine balance; apparent rates of protein breakdown decreased during enteral nutrition only. Glutamine Ra increased 16.8% (NS) and 26.2% (P < 0.01) with parenteral and enteral feeding, respectively, over postabsorptive values. The present findings are consistent with a major role of glutamine in interorgan nitrogen transport in the fed state and further suggest that increased availability of precursors may stimulate glutamine synthesis de novo, and enteral infusion of peptide-bound amino acids may be an effective route to provide free glutamine to the rest of the body. 3amen 3aglutamine 3akinetics 3aamino acid metabolism 3aenteral feeding 2aAdult 2aAmino Acidsxblood 2aEnteral Nutrition 2aGlutaminexadministration & dosagexmetabolism. 2aHumans 2aLeucinexmetabolism 2aMale 2aMiddle Aged 2aModels, Theoretical 2aParenteral Nutrition 3aFrance 0aparenteral administration 0aamino acids1 aJust, B.1 aMessing, B.1 aRongier, M.1 aThuillier, F.1 aKoziet, J.1 aGrasset, E.0 tAmerican journal of clinical nutrition.g1994 June, v. 59, no. 6 p.1395-1402x0002-91657nnas  aDNAL  a19950303b19950309c00000000  aINDdHBI  aOther US 7aarticle02893naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001200110245014400122300001600266500001500282520172900297650002202026650001302048650002102061650001502082650001702097650001402114650001802128650001502146650000902161650002402170650001902194653001302213653001002226653001502236653001602251653001802267700001802285773009002303852000902393930003302402945001302435946001102448655001202459IND2060207520221119230849.0971021e199607  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND206020752DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHan, B.10aDehydrin-like proteins in castor bean seeds and seedlings are differentially produced in response to ABA and water-deficit-related stresses  ap. 933-939.  a2019-12-05  aThe stress inducibility of dehydrin protein production in seedlings of castor bean was analysed by subjecting them to ABA and various water-deficit-related treatments including desiccation, water stress, high salt, high osmolarity, and low temperature. A further goal was to determine whether the immature seed (at stages prior to major dehydrin synthesis) would respond in a similar manner to these stresses. A number of dehydrin-like proteins increased in seedlings subjected to the various stress treatments. In the endosperm, these appear to be different from the dehydrin-related polypeptides that are induced during late seed development and which persist following germination/growth of mature seeds. In the endosperm of seedlings, ABA, water stress and desiccation induced the same dehydrin polypeptides, while high osmolarity, high salt and low temperature induced a different set. Stress-specific differences in dehydrin synthesis were also found in the cotyledons and radicle of castor bean seedlings; however, dehydrins inducible by exogenous ABA were consistently produced. Immature seeds treated with ABA or subjected to stress responded by producing dehydrin-like proteins associated with late development; however, the same proteins were induced following detachment of immature seeds from the parent plant and maintenance on water. When seedlings were exposed simultaneously to GA and either ABA, high salt, or low temperature, dehydrin production was suppressed. It is concluded that dehydrin production in castor bean is tissue-specific and is dependent upon the physiological stage of the seed. In the endosperm, the response to different stresses may rely upon more than one signal transduction pathway. 3aprotein synthesis 3asalinity 3aRicinus communis 3acotyledons 3awater stress 3aendosperm 3aabscisic acid 3aosmolarity 3acold 3aprotein composition 3aplant proteins 0aradicles 0aseeds 0aregulation 0adesiccation 0awater deficit1 aKermode, A.R.0 tJournal of experimental botany.g1996 July, v. 47, no. 300 p.933-939x0022-09577nnas  aDNAL  a19971102b19971106c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US 7aarticle03305naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004300092040001800135072000900153072000900162072000900171072000900180072000900189072000900198100001700207245013500224300001600359500002400375520189700399650002002296650001802316650001302334650001702347650002102364650002002385650001902405650002002424650001802444650001602462650001302478650001802491653002302509700001602532773009202548852000902640856009302649930003302742945002502775946001102800655001202811IND4438393220221119230849.0100611e20100701xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443839322DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aquaculture.2010.04.0212doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL500 0aM001 0aL600 0aM120 0aR100 0aR3001 aDavies, S.J.10aResponse of common carp fry fed diets containing a pea seed meal (Pisum sativum) subjected to different thermal processing methods  ap. 117-123.  aIncludes references  aThree forms of pea seed meal (native - NAT Diet, autoclaved - AC Diet and dry cooked - DC Diet) were evaluated in balanced diets for common carp fry (Cyprinus carpio L.) replacing solvent extracted soybean meal protein in a fish meal / soybean meal based control diet (CTR Diet). After a 49- day growth trial, weight gain, feed conversion ratio, protein efficiency ratio and apparent net nitrogen utilization of fish fed the fish meal / soybean meal diet (CTR Diet) and of that fed the pea seed meal subjected to different thermal treatments were determined. Significant differences (P<0.05) were found in the mean final weight (MFW) and specific growth rates (SGR) between fish fed the CTR and NAT Diets (i.e., mean final weight: 30.69 and 25.70g, respectively; SGR: 2.84 and 2.51g, respectively). The mean final weight of carp fed the autoclaved pea seed meal diet (MFW 28.40g, AC Diet) and the group fed the dry cooked pea seed meal diet (MFW 29.34g, DC Diet) were not deemed significantly (P>0.05) different to those of carp fed the fish meal / soybean meal control diet. A sequential digestibility study was also undertaken to complement the growth trial. Apparent nutrient and energy digestibility coefficients (ADCs) reflected a similar trend as results in the first trial. Apparent nutrient and energy digestibility coefficients were found to be highest when fish were fed the CTR Diet. Apparent digestibility coefficients of carp fed the AC and DC Diets were generally higher than that of the NAT Diet. Overall, ADC's of fish fed the DC Diet were generally higher than that of the AC Diet. It can be concluded that thermal treatment can nutritionally modify pea seed meal to some extent: the dry heating treatment proved to be slightly more effective than the moist heat treatment in terms of growth performance, feed utilization efficiency and apparent digestibility in common carp. 3aCyprinus carpio 3aPisum sativum 3afish fry 3afish feeding 3afeed composition 3afeed processing 3aheat treatment 3afeed conversion 3aanimal growth 3aweight gain 3anitrogen 3adigestibility 0aprotein efficiency1 aGouveia, A.0 tAquaculture.g2010 July 1, v. 305, no. 1-4 p.117-123dElsevier Sciencex0044-84867nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquaculture.2010.04.0213Available from publisher's Web site  a20101123b20101204c00000000  aINDd6CTe2010/10/19  aNon-US 7aarticle02709naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001900145245015900164300001600323500001500339520114800354650001601502650001001518650000901528650002401537650002301561650001401584650001801598650001101616650001401627650001201641650001901653650001501672650002301687650001401710650001301724650001601737650002701753653001501780653002801795653001401823653000901837653002501846700002001871700002001891700001701911773010101928852000902029856008502038930003302123946001102156655001202167IND4437101120221119230747.0100514e201006  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443710112DNAL7 a10.1007/s10570-010-9409-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aUmoren, S.

The effect of addition of halide ions (Cl⁻, Br⁻, and I⁻) was also studied. It was found that CMC functions as an inhibitor for acid induced corrosion for mild steel. Inhibition efficiency increases with increase in immersion time but decreases with increase in temperature. Addition of halide ions reveals that chloride ions (Cl⁻) antagonize the inhibition process whereas iodide ions (I⁻) exert synergistic effect on the corrosion inhibition by CMC. Corrosion inhibitive effect was afforded by adsorption of CMC molecules onto the mild steel surface both in the absence and presence of halide ions which was found to follow Langmuir adsorption isotherm model. The phenomenon of physical adsorption is proposed from decrease in inhibition efficiency with increase in temperature. The inhibition mechanism was further corroborated by the values of thermodynamic and kinetic parameters obtained from the experimental data. 3atemperature 3asteel 3aions 3ahydrogen production 3aphysical phenomena 3acorrosion 3asulfuric acid 3amodels 3achlorides 3aiodides 3athermodynamics 3aadsorption 3asorption isotherms 3asynergism 3abromides 3aweight loss 3acarboxymethylcellulose 0aMild steel 0aCarboxymethyl cellulose 0acellulose 0aAcid 0aCorrosion inhibition1 aSolomon, M.

Several of these species are of conservation concern, and both adults and larvae can be difficult to distinguish morphologically from unisexuals. Here we present a rapid molecular method for screening unisexuals, whose mtDNA is most similar to Ambystoma barbouri. A 258 bp segment of the cytochrome b gene was amplified in six Ambystoma species and exemplar unisexuals by PCR using taxon-specific primers. An internal 113 bp segment was amplified only in unisexuals and A. barbouri using Universal forward and Hybrid reverse primers.

Seven trials were conducted to investigate this encapsulation capacity in terms of Artemia survival and probiotic load in Artemia. Newly hatched Artemia nauplii at 250 nauplii mL⁻¹ were fed individual probiotics at 0, 10³, 10⁵ and 10⁷ colony-forming units (CFU) per millilitre, and mixtures of these two probiotics (10⁵ CFU mL⁻¹) at 30:70, 50:50 or 70:30 v/v in a medium of ozonated water (OW), tryptone soya broth (TSB), and a mixture of these media. The appropriate medium for encapsulation of probiotics by Artemia nauplii was the mixture of OW and TSB at 75:25 v/v; whereas, the use of OW or TSB alone was not effective. Artemia nauplii most effectively encapsulated the customized probiotics at 10⁵ CFU mL⁻¹. The results indicates that the encapsulation of Artemia nauplii is optimized by using a combination of P. synxantha and P. aeruginosa at 50:50 v/v in a media mixture of OW and TSB at 75: 25 v/v. Artemia should be harvested at 48 h when survival is still high (78%) and the probiotic load in Artemia is high (3 x 10⁴ CFU nauplius⁻¹). 3aArtemia 3aMelicertus latisulcatus 3aPseudomonas aeruginosa 3aPseudomonas synxantha 3aencapsulation 3anauplii 3aozonation 3aprobiotics 3ashrimp 3atryptones 0aencapsulation capacity 0aprobiotic1 aBuller, Nicky1 aFotedar, Ravi0 tAquaculture research.g2010 May, v. 41, no. 6 p.893-903dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx1355-557X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2109.2009.02370.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20100514b20100605c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03173naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100002000171245007700191300001600268500001500284520133800299650002401637650001201661650002001673650001801693650004501711650004901756650002401805650004701829650004601876650004401922650003101966650004401997650002302041650002202064650003202086650003702118650003602155650001902191653001802210653002102228653002202249653002102271653002302292700002402315773014702339852000902486856009202495930003302587946001102620655001202631IND4412814020221119230850.0081121e200812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441281402DNAL7 a190909152pmid7 a10.1111/j.1747-0285.2008.00741.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGandhi, Neha S.14aThe Structure of Glycosaminoglycans and their Interactions with Proteins  ap. 455-482.  a2019-12-04  aGlycosaminoglycans (GAGs) are important complex carbohydrates that participate in many biological processes through the regulation of their various protein partners. Biochemical, structural biology and molecular modelling approaches have assisted in understanding the molecular basis of such interactions, creating an opportunity to capitalize on the large structural diversity of GAGs in the discovery of new drugs. The complexity of GAG-protein interactions is in part due to the conformational flexibility and underlying sulphation patterns of GAGs, the role of metal ions and the effect of pH on the affinity of binding. Current understanding of the structure of GAGs and their interactions with proteins is here reviewed: the basic structures and functions of GAGs and their proteoglycans, their clinical significance, the three-dimensional features of GAGs, their interactions with proteins and the molecular modelling of heparin binding sites and GAG-protein interactions. This review focuses on some key aspects of GAG structure-function relationships using classical examples that illustrate the specificity of GAG-protein interactions, such as growth factors, anti-thrombin, cytokines and cell adhesion molecules. New approaches to the development of GAG mimetics as possible new glycotherapeutics are also briefly covered. 3achondroitin sulfate 3aheparin 3ahyaluronic acid 3aproteoglycans 2aAntithrombin IIIxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aChondroitin Sulfatesxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aComputer Simulation 2aGlycosaminoglycansxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aHeparitin Sulfatexchemistryxmetabolism. 2aHyaluronic Acidxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aHydrogen-Ion Concentration 2aKeratan Sulfatexchemistryxmetabolism. 2aMetalsxmetabolism 2aModels, Molecular 2aProtein Structure, Tertiary 2aProteinsxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aStructure-Activity Relationship 2aThermodynamics 0acarbohydrates 0akeratan sulphate 0adermatan sulphate 0aheparan sulphate 0aglycosaminoglycans1 aMancera, Ricardo L.0 tChemical biology & drug design.g2008 Dec., v. 72, no. 6 p.455-482dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing LtdwJournal:jnl3895937x1747-02857nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1747-0285.2008.00741.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20081121b20081206c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03101naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001700152245008900169300001600258500001500274520165400289650002001943650001101963650001801974650001301992650002502005650002302030650002102053650001802074650003302092650001202125650001802137653002202155653001602177700001502193700001502208700002002223700001802243700001502261700002002276700002002296700001502316773013102331852000902462856009202471930003302563946001102596655001202607IND4412810520221119224713.0081121e200811  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441281052DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1748-5967.2008.00177.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAHN, Mi-Hyun10aProduction of therapeutic proteins with baculovirus expression system in insect cell  ap. S71-S78.  a2019-12-04  aRecombinant DNA technology has a major advantage in that it is capable of producing specific therapeutic proteins on demand in a heterologous expression system. The extent of this notion can be understood when one considers how crucial such proteins are, and how problematic the economical and safe production of such proteins are. Therapeutic recombinant protein production is a fundamental aspect of 21st century biotechnology industries. The improved therapeutic recombinant protein expression systems that use prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells have enabled the development of a multi-billion dollar industry. Among the variety of available heterologous expression systems, the baculovirus-based insect cell expression system has been utilized frequently for the high-level production of therapeutic recombinant proteins. Thus, the baculovirus expression system has been recognized as one of the most powerful expression technologies for production, by virtue of the achievable amount and purity, and the ease of the eukaryotic production process. The majority of therapeutic proteins are glycoproteins originating from humans. The insect-based expression system harbors glycosylation processing pathways, which constitute an advantage over other prokaryotic systems that lack glycosylation. However, there are several drawbacks which must be circumvented in order to establish an efficient system for the production of recombinant proteins. This review presents a brief overview of the perspective, particularly the glycosylation aspect, of the production of therapeutic recombinant proteins via a baculovirus-based insect cell expression system. 3arecombinant DNA 3ahumans 3aglycosylation 3aindustry 3arecombinant proteins 3abiopharmaceuticals 3aeukaryotic cells 3abiotechnology 3aheterologous gene expression 3ainsects 3aglycoproteins 0aprotein synthesis 0ainsect cell1 aSONG, Mira1 aOH, Eun-Yi1 aJamāl, Arshad.1 aKIM, HyunSoon1 aKO, Kinarm1 aCHOO, Young-Kug1 aKim, Byung-Jin.1 aKO, Kisung0 tEntomological research.g2008 Nov., v. 38, no. s1 p.S71-S78dMelbourne, Australia : Blackwell Publishing Asiax1738-22977nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1748-5967.2008.00177.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20081121b20081206c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle01932naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245005300126300001800179520079300197650001100990650002601001650002401027650000901051650001601060650001101076650001101087650001101098650001101109650001201120650001301132650003001145650001401175653001901189653001301208653001301221653001701234653001901251653003301270653001401303773009101317852000901408930003301417945001301450946001101463655001201474IND2062284720221119224712.0980306e199705  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND206228472DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBaker, C.J.10aMeasurements of the natural frequencies of trees  ap. 1125-1132.  aRecent theoretical work has suggested that tree natural frequency is an important indication of tree stability in windy conditions. This paper reports natural frequency measurements on a large number of urban trees using a remote laser-based method. The majority of the measurements were made on healthy lime trees, and showed a consistent variation of natural frequency with tree size, with out-of-leaf, winter frequencies being substantially greater than in-leaf, summer frequencies. These measurements also revealed that different tree geometries can produce significant changes in natural frequency. A number of measurements were made on diseased lime trees (crown die-back, rot, etc.) and these displayed natural frequencies that were very different from those for the healthy trees. 3aheight 3aplant characteristics 3aAcer pseudoplatanus 3awind 3ameasurement 3alasers 3aleaves 3awinter 3asummer 3adieback 3adiameter 3afungal diseases of plants 3afrequency 0ainterferometry 0ageometry 0amovement 0awind effects 0atilia europaea 0alaser doppler interferometry 0abasal rot0 tJournal of experimental botany.g1997 May, v. 48, no. 310 p.1125-1132x0022-09577nnas  aDNAL  a19980401b19980408c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US 7aarticle03404naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002700152245008900179300001800268500002400286520219800310650001802508650001802526650001702544650002202561650002202583651001702605651001802622653002002640653002902660653003302689653001902722653001702741653002602758653003102784700002302815773010402838852000902942856005502951655001203006IND4427396820221119224906.0091016e200911  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442739682DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-2745.2009.01579.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCavieres, Lohengrin A.10aDo facilitative interactions increase species richness at the entire community level  ap. 1181-1191.  aIncludes references  a1. Although the consequences of facilitation at individual and population levels are well known, the community-level consequences of these processes have received much less attention. In particular, the importance of facilitation in determining richness at the entire community level has seldom been evaluated. 2. In this study, we sampled 11 alpine plant communities along the southern Andes in South America, spanning from tropical (25°S) to sub-antarctic latitudes (55°S). Plant communities were dominated by cushion plants, a particular growth form that acts as a nurse plant for other plant species. Through rarefaction curves, we assessed the effectiveness of community sampling and estimated the number of species present within and outside cushions. Non-metric Multidimensional Scaling ordinations (NMDS) were used to assess differences between the species assemblages growing within and outside cushions. Finally, samples from cushions and open areas were combined in a single matrix accounting for the difference in cover between both microhabitats, and through rarefaction curves we assessed how many more species are added to the community due to the presence of cushions. 3. Samples taken within cushions always contained more species than equivalent samples from open areas. However, the magnitude of this difference varied among communities. NMDS ordination indicated that cushions generate species assemblages structurally different from those found in open areas. Inclusion of samples from cushion and open areas in synthetic analyses - where differences in cover were accounted for - indicated that the presence of cushions consistently increased species richness at the entire community level. The magnitude of these increases in species richness varied with habitat severity, with lower values at both extremes of the environmental severity gradient. 4.Synthesis. Facilitative interactions with cushion nurse plants along the high Andes of southern South America changed plant assemblage structure and increased species richness at the entire community level, indicating that facilitative interactions are pivotal in maintaining the diversity of these harsh environments. 3aalpine plants 3amicrohabitats 3anurse plants 3aplant communities 3aspecies diversity 3aAndes region 3aSouth America 0aalpine habitats 0aalpine plant communities 0acommunity-level interactions 0acushion plants 0afacilitation 0apositive interactions 0astress gradient hypothesis1 aBadano, Ernesto I.0 tjournal of ecology.g2009 Nov., v. 97, no. 6 p.1181-1191dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0022-04777nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2745.2009.01579.x 7aarticle03233naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092024002200134024001900156040001800175100001400193245015700207300001600364520184200380653002702222653001902249653002402268653001002292653002402302700001302326700001102339700001302350700001202363700001202375700001202387700001402399700001602413700001902429700001402448700001402462700001502476700001202491773011502503852000902618856009202627930003302719946001102752655001202763IND4412817120221119224854.0081121e200812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441281712DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1748-1716.2008.01883.x2doi7 aPMC26593872pmcid7 a186166192pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Y.10aCorrelations between clinical and physiological consequences of the novel mutation R878C in a highly conserved pore residue in the cardiac Na⁺ channel  ap. 311-323.  aWe compared the clinical and physiological consequences of the novel mutation R878C in a highly conserved pore residue in domain II (S5-S6) of human, hNav1.5, cardiac Na⁺ channels. Full clinical evaluation of pedigree members through three generations of a Chinese family combined with SCN5A sequencing from genomic DNA was compared with patch and voltage-clamp results from two independent expression systems. The four mutation carriers showed bradycardia, and slowed sino-atrial, atrioventricular and intraventricular conduction. Two also showed sick sinus syndrome; two had ST elevation in leads V1 and V2. Unlike WT-hNav1.5, whole-cell patch-clamped HEK293 cells expressing R878C-hNav1.5 showed no detectable Na⁺ currents (iNa), even with substitution of a similarly charged lysine residue. Voltage-clamped Xenopus oocytes injected with either 0.04 or 1.5 μg μL⁻¹ R878C-hNav1.5 cRNA similarly showed no iNa, yet WT-hNav1.5 cRNA diluted to 0.0004-0.0008 ng μL⁻¹resulted in expression of detectable iNa. iNa was simply determined by the amount of injected WT-hNav1.5: doubling the dose of WT-hNav1.5 cRNA doubled iNa. iNa amplitudes and activation and inactivation characteristics were similar irrespective of whether WT-hNav1.5 cRNA was given alone or combined with equal doses of R878C-hNav1.5 cRNA therefore excluding dominant negative phenotypic effects. Na⁺ channel function in HEK293 cells transfected with R878C-hNav1.5 was not restored by exposure to mexiletine (200 μ m) and lidocaine (100 μ m). Fluorescence confocal microscopy using E3-Nav1.5 antibody demonstrated persistent membrane expression of both WT and R878C-hNav1.5. Modelling studies confirmed that such iNa reductions reproduced the SSS phenotype. Clinical consequences of the novel R878C mutation correlate with results of physiological studies. 0acardiac Na⁺ channels 0anovel mutation 0apore-forming region 0aSCN5A 0asick sinus syndrome1 aWang, T.1 aMa, A.1 aZhou, X.1 aGui, J.1 aWan, H.1 aShi, R.1 aHuang, C.1 aGrace, A.A.1 aHuang, C.L.-H.1 aTrump, D.1 aZhang, H.1 aZimmer, T.1 aLei, M.0 tActa physiologica.g2008 Dec., v. 194, no. 4 p.311-323dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx1748-17087nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1748-1716.2008.01883.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20081121b20081206c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02266naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001500152245011600167300001600283520105400299653001601353653001501369653001801384653001901402653003801421653001601459653001501475653001801490653001901508653003801527700001701565700001801582773014701600852000901747856009201756930003301848946001101881655001201892IND4412814520221119224931.0081121e200812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441281452DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1747-0285.2008.00733.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhou, Peng10aLigEvolutioner, a New Strategy for Modification and Optimization of Lead Compounds in Receptor/Ligand Complexes  ap. 525-532.  aWith the number of solved protein/ligand complex 3D structures growing up rapidly in recent years, lead modification and optimization based on the complex structure have received much attention in drug design community. In this study, we propose a novel method LigEvolutioner for the purpose of lead optimization in protein/ligand complexes. Using a fragment substitution strategy in the context of evolutionary algorithm, LigEvolutioner can analyze the complex structures automatically and derive several modification projects that could possibly improve the binding affinity of ligands. For instance, LigEvolutioner was employed to analyze and modify antigenic peptide ligand in human HLA-A*0201/peptide complexes and, as a result, a peptide analogue with potential high affinity was designed. The structure configuration of this modified peptide is consistent with crystal profile and antigen presenting theory. In addition, we have confirmed the validity of LigEvolutioner by systematically comparing it with several widely used scoring methods. 0adrug design 0aHLA-A*0201 0alead compound 0aLigEvolutioner 0astructure-based lead optimization 0adrug design 0aHLA-A*0201 0alead compound 0aLigEvolutioner 0astructure-based lead optimization1 aTian, Feifei1 aShang, Zhicai0 tChemical biology & drug design.g2008 Dec., v. 72, no. 6 p.525-532dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing LtdwJournal:jnl3895937x1747-02857nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1747-0285.2008.00733.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20090123b20090206c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02789naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001700164245012300181300001800304520124900322650002101571650002001592650002001612650001001632650002001642650001801662650002201680650001501702650002601717650001701743650001201760650003201772650003901804650001101843650002101854650004901875653002601924653001001950653001001960653003001970653001202000700001402012773011902026852000902145856008502154930003302239946001102272655001202283IND4439748120221119225129.0100709e201007  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443974812DNAL7 a197571822pmid7 a10.1007/s11033-009-9789-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCheng, Fang 10aRNA interference: a potent technology in studying and modulating of dendritic cells, and potential in clinical therapy  ap. 2635-2644.  aRNA interference (RNAi) is a natural process by which small interfering RNA duplex directs sequencespecific post-transcriptional silencing of homologous genes by binding to its complementary mRNA and triggering its elimination. The history of RNAi has only about two decades, however, further studies have revealed that it is a potent method of gene silencing that has developed rapidly over the past few years as a result of its extensive importance in the study of genetics, molecular biology and physiology. RNAi technology has also recently yielded significant insight into dendritic cells (DCs) by helping to elucidate numerous mechanisms that regulate the development, activation and function of cells that mediate immunity. In addition, because of its ability to suppress gene expression effectively, this technique may be used to regulate the immune response for clinical purposes. As the key antigen presenting cells, DCs play a crucial part in the start of an immune response and in the enhancement and regulation of cell mediated immune reactions. The current studies indicated that targeting DCs with RNAi is a novel and effective therapeutic method for the fundamental research, and displayed great potential in clinical treatment. 3aRNA interference 3adendritic cells 3agene expression 3agenes 3aimmune response 3amessenger RNA 3amolecular biology 3aphysiology 3asmall interfering RNA 3atherapeutics 2aAnimals 2aDendritic Cellsximmunology 2aGene Knockdown Techniquesxmethods 2aHumans 2aRNA Interference 2aTranslational Research, Biomedicalxmethods. 0aDendritic cells (DCs) 0asiRNA 0ashRNA 0aSpecific immune responses 0aVaccine1 aHe, Song 0 tMolecular biology reports.g2010 July, v. 37, no. 6 p.2635-2644dDordrecht : Springer Netherlandsx0301-48517nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11033-009-9789-73Available from publisher's Web site  a20100709b20100807c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03021naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024003500133040001800168100002000186245010800206300001800314500001500332520127200347650002001619650001501639650001201654650001501666650001201681650002701693650002401720650003401744650001401778650001001792650002601802650003701828650001501865650001101880650001301891650003101904650002401935650002001959650000901979650002601988653001402014653002002028653001702048653002202065653002002087700001502107700002002122700002302142773011402165852000902279856008502288930003302373946001302406655001202419IND4439730920221119225031.0100709e201008  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443973092DNAL7 a203008512pmid7 aPMC29005932pmcid7 a10.1007/s10439-010-0005-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBuibas, Marius 10aMapping the Spatiotemporal Dynamics of Calcium Signaling in Cellular Neural Networks Using Optical Flow  ap. 2520-2531.  a2019-12-04  aAn optical flow gradient algorithm was applied to spontaneously forming networks of neurons and glia in culture imaged by fluorescence optical microscopy in order to map functional calcium signaling with single pixel resolution. Optical flow estimates the direction and speed of motion of objects in an image between subsequent frames in a recorded digital sequence of images (i.e., a movie). Computed vector field outputs by the algorithm were able to track the spatiotemporal dynamics of calcium signaling patterns. We begin by briefly reviewing the mathematics of the optical flow algorithm, and then describe how to solve for the displacement vectors and how to measure their reliability. We then compare computed flow vectors with manually estimated vectors for the progression of a calcium signal recorded from representative astrocyte cultures. Finally, we applied the algorithm to preparations of primary astrocytes and hippocampal neurons and to the rMC-1 Muller glial cell line in order to illustrate the capability of the algorithm for capturing different types of spatiotemporal calcium activity. We discuss the imaging requirements, parameter selection and threshold selection for reliable measurements, and offer perspectives on uses of the vector data. 3aneural networks 3aastrocytes 3aneurons 2aAlgorithms 2aAnimals 2aAstrocytesxphysiology 2aCalciumxphysiology 2aCalcium Signalingxphysiology 2aCell Line 2aCells 2aHippocampusxcytology 2aMicrogliaxcytologyxphysiology. 2aMicroscopy 2aMotion 2aMovement 2aNeural Networks, Computer. 2aNeuronsxphysiology 2aOptical Devices 2aRats 2aSpinal Cordxcytology 0aneuroglia 0aNeural circuits 0aOptical flow 0aCalcium signaling 0aCalcium imaging1 aYu, Diana 1 aNizar, Krystal 1 aSilva, Gabriel A. 0 tAnnals of biomedical engineering.g2010 Aug., v. 38, no. 8 p.2520-2531dBoston : Springer USx0090-69647nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10439-010-0005-73Available from publisher's Web site  a20100709b20100807c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle01954naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002800111040001800139100001600157245005600173300001600229500001500245520064000260650001700900650001700917650000900934650001700943650001600960650001200976650002000988650001601008650002201024653001401046653001701060653002201077653002301099653001801122653001901140653001301159653002001172653001401192653002101206773008901227852000901316856007801325930003301403945001301436946001101449655001201460IND2033752320221119225050.0931004e199305  gw |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND203375232DNAL7 a241935852pmid7 a10.1007/BF008385532doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAslam, K.M.14aThe Sfm system of gene control in Antirrhinum majus  ap. 401-405.  a2019-12-04  aIn Antirrhinum majus, pal-rec, an allele of the pallida series, is considered to be involved in anthocyanin production. The pal-rec gene normally mutates autonomously from the recessive condition to the dominant giving fully pigmented Pal spots on a colorless background. The Sfm element, when inserted at the pal locus, destabilizes the activity of the pal-rec gene in such a way that the repressor (Sf) component abolishes gene activity in almost all of the cell lineages, whereas the mutator (m) acts to release full gene expression in some of the cells. Such a flip-flop control of the pal-rec results in what is known as shifting. 3aanthocyanins 3abiosynthesis 3aloci 3apigmentation 3amutagenesis 3aflowers 3arecessive genes 3atransposons 3aAntirrhinum majus 0adominance 0apal-rec gene 0amutability shifts 0agenetic regulation 0atransposition 0agenetic change 0amutation 0ainhibitor genes 0apal locus 0ashifting factors0 tTheoretical and applied genetics.g1993 May, v. 86, no. 4 p.401-405x0040-57527nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF008385533Available from publisher's Web site  a19931104b19931109c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US 7aarticle00794naa a2200253 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245002900126300001500155520013900170650002400309650001800333650001800351651001700369773007400386852000900460930003300469945001300502946001300515655001200528IND2033752420221119225052.0931004e199309  vau|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND203375242DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aScahill, P.12aA commitment to catering  ap. 32- 35.  aFor the Pittsburgh School District, a growing demand for special food services led to the birth of a full-fledged catering department. 3aschool food service 3amenu planning 3aprofitability 3aPennsylvania0 tSchool food service journal.g1993 Sept., v. 47, no. 8 p.32- 357nnas  aDNAL  a19931104b19931109c00000000  aINDdJFM  aOther US 7aarticle03177naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002200164245008600186300001600272500001500288520150300303650002401806650001401830650001001844650007401854650001101928650002201939650001101961650000901972650001601981650003201997650003202029650002602061650004002087650001602127651002702143653002802170653001902198653002602217653001502243700002202258700002602280700002502306700002302331700002002354773012302374852000902497856008502506930003302591946001102624655001202635IND4436755120221119225023.0100507e201005  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443675512DNAL7 a202293132pmid7 a10.1007/s10654-010-9439-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHublin, Christer 10aShift-work and cardiovascular disease: a population-based 22-year follow-up study  ap. 315-323.  a2019-12-04  aStudies on the association between shift-work and cardiovascular disease (CVD), in particular coronary heart disease (CHD), have given conflicting results. In this prospective population-based study we assessed the association of shift-work with three endpoints: CHD mortality, disability retirement due to CVD, and incident hypertension. A cohort of 20,142 adults (the Finnish Twin Cohort) was followed from 1982 to 2003. Type of working time (daytime/nighttime/shift-work) was assessed by questionnaires in 1975 (response rate 89%) and in 1981 (84%). Causes of death, information on disability retirement and hypertension medication were obtained from nationwide official registers. Cox proportional hazard models were used to obtain hazard ratios (HR) for each endpoint by type of working time. Adjustments were made for 14 socio-demographic and lifestyle covariates. 76.9% were daytime workers and 9.5% shift-workers both in 1975 and in 1981. During the follow-up, 857 deaths due to CHD, 721 disability retirements due to CVD, and 2,642 new cases of medicated hypertension were observed. However, HRs for shift-work were not significant (mortality HR men 1.09 and women 1.22; retirement 1.15 and 0.96; hypertension 1.15 and 0.98, respectively). The results were essentially similar after full adjustments for all covariates. Within twin pairs, no association between shift work and outcome was observed. Our results do not support an association between shift-work and cardiovascular morbidity. 3amyocardial ischemia 3amortality 2aAdult 2aCardiovascular Diseasesxepidemiologyxetiologyxgeneticsxmortality. 2aFemale 2aFollow-Up Studies 2aHumans 2aMale 2aMiddle Aged 2aProportional Hazards Models 2aSurveys and Questionnaires. 2aTwin Studies as Topic 2aWork Schedule Tolerancexphysiology 2aYoung Adult 0aFinlandxepidemiology. 0acardiovascular diseases 0aGenetic effect 0aDisability retirement 0aShift-work1 aPartinen, Markku 1 aKoskenvuo, Karoliina 1 aSilventoinen, Karri 1 aKoskenvuo, Markku 1 aKaprio, Jaakko 0 tEuropean journal of epidemiology.g2010 May, v. 25, no. 5 p.315-323dDordrecht : Springer Netherlandsx0393-29907nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10654-010-9439-33Available from publisher's Web site  a20100508b20100605c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02024naa a2200289 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245008500126300001400211520119100225650001601416650003101432650002301463650002301486700001701509700001401526700001701540773009701557852000901654930003301663945001301696946001301709655001201722IND2033749420221119225120.0931004e199304  ctu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND203374942DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSilva, J.L.10aPhysicochemical and sensory properties of muscadine grape juice and concentrates  ap. 81-90.  aJuices from bronze and red muscadines were concentrated by low-temperature vacuum evaporation.

Red juice was higher in soluble solids and Brix-to-acid (BTA) than bronze, but pH, acid, and viscosity were similar. When concentrated to 68 degrees Brix, the BTA was the same regardless of juice type. Enzyme treated samples were not different from their nontreated counterparts, except for slightly higher pH of treated red juice. Hue angle for bronze concentrate shifted from abut 100 to 78 while chroma increased. Hue for the red juice shifted from about 40 to 95, while chroma remained constant. Fructose and glucose were the major sugars with sucrose averaging less than 1%. Panelists rated the bronze reconstituted juices lower in color intensity, aroma intensity, sweetness, acidity, and flavor than the single-strength juice. However, the red reconstituted juices were rated higher in color intensity than their single-strength counterparts. Panelists rated reconstituted juices higher when reconstituted with essence recovered plus water than with water only. 3agrape juice 3aphysicochemical properties 3asensory properties 3ajuice concentrates1 aGhaedian, R.1 aWoods, F.1 aGarner, J.O.0 tJournal of food quality.g1993 Apr., v. 16, no. 2 p.81-90wJournal:jnl10994x0146-94287nnas  aDNAL  a19931104b19931109c00000000  aINDdDLB  aOther US 7aarticle02361naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001800128245006500146300001600211500001500227520101100242650001201253650001701265650000901282650001301291650001601304650001101320650002401331650003001355650001501385650001001400650001801410650001201428650001701440650002401457650001101481650005301492650000901545653001501554653001101569653001101580700001801591700002001609700001801629700002001647773009601667852000901763930003301772945001301805946001301818655001201831IND2040587920221119225212.0940629e199312  mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204058792DNAL7 a82498712pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJohnson, A.O.10aAdaptation of lactose maldigesters to continued milk intakes  ap. 879-881.  a2019-12-05  aTwenty-five lactose-maldigesting and lactose-intolerant African Americans, ranging in age from 13 to 39 y, were given gradually increasing amounts of lactose in milk over a period of time until the maximum lactose dose tolerated was determined. Seventeen (77%) of the 22 subjects who completed the study tolerated larger than or equal to 12 g lactose and 5 (23%) tolerated < 12 g. Breath-hydrogen tests done on each subject with the maximum dose of lactose tolerated showed that only four (18%) had a breath-hydrogen concentration < 5 ppm above fasting concentration. This study suggests that the majority of African-american young adults who claim intolerance to moderate amounts of milk can ultimately adapt and tolerate larger than or equal to 12 g lactose in milk (the equivalent of 8 oz of full-lactose milk) with minimal or no discomfort if milk is ingested in gradually increasing amounts. The mechanism of adaptation is assumed to be an increased tolerance to colonic lactose-fermentation products. 3alactose 3ayoung adults 3amilk 3ahydrogen 3aadolescents 3aBlacks 3alactose intolerance 2aAdaptation, Physiological 2aAdolescent 2aAdult 2aBlack People. 2aAnimals 2aBreath Tests 2aDouble-Blind Method 2aHumans 2aLactose Intolerancexethnologyxphysiopathology. 2aMilk 0aadaptation 0abreath 0aintake1 aSemenya, J.G.1 aBuchowski, M.S.1 aEnwonwu, C.O.1 aScrimshaw, N.S.0 tAmerican journal of clinical nutrition.g1993 Dec., v. 58, no. 6 p.879-881x0002-91657nnas  aDNAL  a19940802b19940811c00000000  aINDdHBI  aOther US 7aarticle02232naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002000110245019500130300001800325520103100343650001801374650001701392650002001409650001501429650002801444650001701472650001001489650002001499650001801519650002001537650002401557650002201581653001801603653001701621700001201638700001401650773009201664852000901756930003301765945001301798946001101811655001201822IND2062727020221119225208.0980325e199707  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND206272702DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBalestrazzi, A.10aGene amplification and enzyme modification are responsible for the methotrexate-resistance of two carrot cell lines that overproduce bifunctional dihydrofolate reductase-thymidylate synthase  ap. 1393-1400.  aThe molecular basis for the MTX-resistance of two carrot cell lines that overproduce bifunctional dihydrofolate reductase-thymidylate synthase (DHFR-TS) was investigated using cDNA probes for carrot DHFR-TS isolated in our laboratory. The results of molecular and cytogenetic analyses suggest that only one of the tested lines (E2A1C1) underwent an event of gene amplification (10-fold) resulting in increased levels of the target enzyme and its mRNA. The other MTX-resistant line analysed (E2A1C), which had a normal content of the dhfr-ts gene and of the relevant transcript, was found to contain a DHFR activity that was less sensitive to MTX. Southern blot analysis revealed variations in the EcoRI restriction pattern for both resistant lines. These results suggest that in carrot cells, as in animal systems, MTX-resistance can be due to different events such as gene amplification and gene modifications; the latter appear to be responsible for the increased production of a target enzyme with reduced affinity for MTX. 3aDaucus carota 3amethotrexate 3adrug resistance 3acell lines 3adihydrofolate reductase 3atransferases 3agenes 3agene expression 3amessenger RNA 3aenzyme activity 3arestriction mapping 3achromosome number 0aamplification 0adhfr-ts gene1 aLuo, M.1 aCella, R.0 tJournal of experimental botany.g1997 July, v. 48, no. 312 p.1393-1400x0022-09577nnas  aDNAL  a19980502b19980508c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US 7aarticle01592naa a2200289 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001800110245009300128300001600221520074100237650001700978650001700995650002701012650002501039650002101064653001501085700002301100773009901123852000901222930003301231945001301264946001301277655001201290IND2033750320221119225115.0931004e199304  ctu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND203375032DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCollins, J.K.10aPostharvest changes in strawberry fruit stored under simulated retail display conditions  ap. 133-143.  a'Cardinal' strawberry fruit were placed in plastic boxes with plastic dome lids (PDL) or with polyethylene wrap (PE), warmed to 25 degrees C for 8 h and stored at 1 degree C or 5 degrees C to simulate retail storage temperature conditions.

The rate of carnitine excretion was lower after the LP diet than after the HP diet because of lower GFR after the LP diet. The rate of carnitine reabsorption was lower after the LP diet than after the UP diet, also because of the lower GFR after the LP diet. The rate of carnitine reabsorption was not different after the HF and HC diets, nor was GFR. The filtered load of carnitine, however, was greater after the HF diet, resulting in a higher rate of carnitine excretion. 3anutrient intake 3adietary protein 3acarnitine 3adietary fat 3aurine 3amen 3aglomerular filtration rate 3awomen 3adietary carbohydrate 3ablood plasma 3aexcretion 2aAdult 2aCarnitinexbloodxmetabolismxurine. 2aDiet 2aDietary Carbohydratesxadministration & dosage 2aDietary Fatsxadministration & dosage 2aDietary Proteinsxadministration & dosage 2aFemale 2aGlomerular Filtration Rate 2aHumans 2aMale 3aIowa 0adiet 0areabsorption1 aChenard, C.A.1 aRebouche, C.J.0 tAmerican journal of clinical nutrition.g1993 Dec., v. 58, no. 6 p.868-872x0002-91657nnas  aDNAL  a19940802b19940811c00000000  aINDdHBI  aOther US 7aarticle02349naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002000110245006600130300001800196500001500214520134000229650002301569650001601592650001001608650001801618650001001636650001401646650002101660650002001681650002301701653001501724653002701739653002201766700001701788773009201805852000901897930003301906945001301939946001101952655001201963IND2062726920221119225109.0980325e199707  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND206272692DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMcCulloch, S.R.14aThe electrophysiology of plasmolysed cells of Chara australis  ap. 1383-1392.  a2019-12-05  aThe electrophysiology of non-turgid cells of Chara australis was investigated. The data fell into two categories. 20% of cells; these were relatively unaffected by plasmolysis (with the exception of a small depolarization) and retained many aspects of normal electrophysiological behaviour, such as excitation and K(+)-state I/V characteristics when exposed to 5 mol m-3 K(+). 80% of cells; these showed electrophysiology significantly altered by plasmolysis. These cells exhibited a large depolarization and became highly conductive after plasmolysis. The classic current relaxation kinetics upon voltage step changes diminished. The channels constituting this high conductance state appeared to be weakly anion selective. Application of Ca(2+) channel blocker LaCl3 did not prevent development of the high conductance. Upon exposure to 5 mol m-3 K(+), the negative conductance regions were much less pronounced than those in turgid cells. Excitation was abolished. Cells in both categories showed a steady increase in conductance with time. The effects of plasmolysis on cell membrane conductance were irreversible. The information gathered from turgorless Chara cells can be extrapolated to explain depolarized or positive resting potentials and predominance of weakly anion selective channels in some higher plant cell protoplasts. 3apotassium channels 3aplasmolysis 3aChara 3aion transport 3acells 3apotassium 3aelectric current 3aplasma membrane 3amembrane potential 0ai/v curves 0aelectrical conductance 0aelectrophysiology1 aBeilby, M.J.0 tJournal of experimental botany.g1997 July, v. 48, no. 312 p.1383-1392x0022-09577nnas  aDNAL  a19980502b19980508c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US 7aarticle02523naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100002200128245005800150300001600208500001500224520106800239650002101307650001601328650000801344650001001352650001201362650001201374650004001386650001001426650002101436650001101457650000801468650001101476650003101487650000901518650001601527650002401543650002401567650001201591650001601603650001601619653001601635653002401651653001801675653001301693700001501706700001801721700001901739700002301758773009601781852000901877930003301886945001301919946001301932655001201945IND2040586820221119225135.0940629e199312  mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204058682DNAL7 a82498662pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKooy, K. van der.10aEffect of a weight cycle on visceral fat accumulation  ap. 853-857.  a2019-12-05  aMagnetic resonance imaging was used to study the effect of a single weight cycle on three fat depots: the visceral and subcutaneous abdominal depots and the subcutaneous depot at the trochanter level. Obese subjects (17 men, 15 women) were examined before and after weight-loss intervention and 67 wk after intervention. They lost 12.9 +/- 3.3 (mean +/- SD) kg body wt during intervention and regained 11.9 +/- 5.1 kg during follow-up. Weight regain did not result in greater body fatness than before weight loss (initial fat mass: 34.3 +/- 6.1 kg, final fat mass: 32.8 +/- 7.7 kg; P = 0.047). There was no indication of a preferential deposition of visceral fat after weight regain (initial visceral fat area: 120 +/- 41 cm(2), final visceral fat area: 110 +/- 48 cm(2); P = 0.087). On the contrary, there was a slight tendency to accumulate subcutaneous fat at the expense of visceral fat.

As with many other mycoplasmas involved in animal diseases, protective immune responses have not been achieved with vaccines, even though antibody responses can be obtained. This study focuses on characterizing the interaction of M. ovipneumoniae with ovine PBMC using carboxy-fluorescein-succinimidyl-ester (CFSE) loading and flow cytometry to measure lymphoid cell division. M. ovipneumoniae induced a strong in vitro polyclonal suppression of CD4⁺, CD8⁺, and B blood lymphocyte subsets. The suppressive activity could be destroyed by heating to 60°C, and partially impaired by formalin and binary ethyleneimine treatment that abolished its viability. The activity resided on the surface-exposed membrane protein fraction of the mycoplasma, since mild trypsin treatment not affecting viability was shown to reduce suppressive activity. Trypsin-treated mycoplasma regained suppressive activity once the mycoplasma was allowed to re-synthesize its surface proteins. Implications for the design of vaccines against M. ovipneumoniae are discussed. 3aethyleneimine 3aMycoplasma ovipneumoniae 3abacterial pneumonia 3apolyclonal antibodies 3asheep 3alymphocytes 3agoats 3aflow cytometry 3asheep diseases 3aouter membrane proteins 3aimmune response 3agoat diseases 2aAnimals 2aAntigens, Bacterial 2aAntigens, Surface 2aBacterial Proteinsximmunology 2aBacterial Vaccinesximmunology 2aImmune Tolerance 2aIn Vitro Techniques 2aLeukocytes, Mononuclearximmunologyxmicrobiology. 2aLymphocyte Activation 2aLymphocyte Subsetsximmunologyxmicrobiology. 2aMembrane Proteinsximmunology 2aMitogensxpharmacology 2aMycoplasma ovipneumoniaeximmunologyxpathogenicity. 2aPneumonia, Mycoplasmaximmunologyxmicrobiologyxprevention & controlxveterinary. 2aSheep 2aSheep Diseasesximmunologyxmicrobiologyxprevention & control. 0acarboxy-fluorescein-succinimidyl-ester loading 0amononuclear leukocytes1 aAjuwape, Adebowale Titilayo Phillip1 aRosenbusch, Ricardo Francisco0 tVeterinary immunology and immunopathology.g2010 July, v. 136, no. 1-2 p.116-121dElsevierx0165-24277nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vetimm.2010.02.0013Available from publisher's Web site  a20100907b20101001c00000000  aINDd6CTe2010/07/26  aNon-US 7aarticle02901naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004300092040001800135072000900153072000900162072000900171100001600180245010200196300001400298500002400312520170500336650003002041650001202071650001802083650001602101650001902117650002402136650001302160650001202173650001902185700002602204773009002230852000902320856009302329930003302422945002502455946001102480655001202491IND4438394220221119224745.0100611e20100701xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443839422DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aquaculture.2010.04.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL200 0aM001 0aL2101 aFearman, J.10aWarmer temperatures reduce rates of gametogenesis in temperate mussels, Mytilus galloprovincialis  ap. 20-25.  aIncludes references  aTemperature is known to have a substantial effect on the rate of reproductive maturation in many marine organisms, yet the effect of a range of temperatures on the rate of gametogenesis in Mytilus galloprovincialis has not been thoroughly investigated. Temperature influences natural reproduction and population dynamics in bivalves, and is often used in hatcheries to regulate broodstock conditioning. In this study mussels were held at, 7°C, 10°C, 13°C, 16°C, and 19°C, which includes temperatures within the natural range. Feeding ration was 10% of the dry weight of the mussels, and samples were collected regularly throughout the nine week conditioning period. Gametogenesis occurred at varying rates according to conditioning temperature. Glycogen concentration decreased in all temperatures at the same rate. At 7°C larger oocytes were significantly more frequent and space in the mantle tissue was greater than at 16°C. A greater proportion of vitellogenic oocytes were produced in mussels at 10°C and 13°C compared to other temperatures. Glycogen storage tissue, as a percentage of the mantle tissue, was greatest at 19°C, and lowest at 7°C and 10°C. Fecundity and D-veliger larvae production were not influenced by temperature. These results suggest that the effect of temperature on the rate of gametogenesis is strongly influenced by energy balance. At low temperatures gametogenesis is more rapid, while at high temperatures gametogenesis is slowed by the increased demands of metabolism and potentially decreased assimilation efficiency, limiting surplus energy for reproduction. This information can be applied within a hatchery setting to optimise broodstock conditioning. 3aMytilus galloprovincialis 3amussels 3agametogenesis 3atemperature 3abreeding stock 3aanimal reproduction 3aglycogen 3aoocytes 3aenergy balance1 aMoltschaniwskyj, N.A.0 tAquaculture.g2010 July 1, v. 305, no. 1-4 p.20-25dElsevier Sciencex0044-84867nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquaculture.2010.04.0033Available from publisher's Web site  a20101123b20101204c00000000  aINDd6CTe2010/10/19  aNon-US 7aarticle02022naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245006400127300001600191500001500207520101800222650001301240650002301253650002101276650002001297650001801317650001301335650001201348650001401360650002001374650001001394650001301404653002301417653001201440700001601452773009001468852000901558930003301567945001301600946001101613655001201624IND2060191120221119224744.0971020e199607  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND206019112DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMiller, A.J.10aNitrate transport and compartmentation in cereal root cells  ap. 843-854.  a2019-12-05  aMeasurement of cytosolic nitrate is one of the factors required for the resolution of factors controlling nitrate uptake and assimilation in plants and for identifying likely nitrate transport mechanisms at both the plasma membrane and tonoplast. This paper reviews methods and reported measurements of cytosolic nitrate in higher plants and concludes that nitrate-selective microelectrodes are the best approach. These micro-electrodes have been used to measure intracellular nitrate activities in barley and maize root cells. Triple-barrelled electrodes, incorporating a pH-sensing barrel have been used to identify the compartmental location of the nitrate-selective tip giving unequivocal estimates of vacuolar and cytosolic nitrate activities. The microelectrode measurements are used to discuss the possible mechanisms of nitrate transport at both the tonoplast and plasma membrane. The energetics of possible proton-coupled transport systems are described and the feasibility of the mechanism is discussed. 3aZea mays 3anutrient transport 3anutrient content 3aHordeum vulgare 3aion transport 3avacuoles 3acytosol 3atonoplast 3aplasma membrane 3aroots 3anitrates 0aliterature reviews 0aPoaceae1 aSmith, S.J.0 tJournal of experimental botany.g1996 July, v. 47, no. 300 p.843-854x0022-09577nnas  aDNAL  a19971102b19971106c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US 7aarticle02962naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100001700171245011800188300001600306500002400322520138500346650001901731650001101750650001101761650002101772650001501793650001501808650002501823650002401848650001201872650002701884650004101911650005901952650003802011650001102049650005302060650002502113650002502138650006002163650004302223700001702266700001602283773011702299852000902416856005502425655001202480IND4445697420221119230858.0101126e201012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444569742DNAL7 a208873902pmid7 a10.1111/j.1439-0264.2010.01027.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCivinini, A.10aImmunohistochemical Localization of Oestrogen Receptor Alpha in the Various Cell Categories of Chick Embryo Ovary  ap. 546-554.  aIncludes references  aWith 2 figures SUMMARY: The immunohistochemical (IHC) localization of oestrogen receptor alpha (ERα) was studied in the developing left ovary of 14.5‐day‐old chick embryos. The study was focused in particular on distinguishing in cortex and medulla the different cell categories that proved positive to the reaction, in order to gain further understanding of gonadal cell interactions during ovarian development. Immunostained cells were observed in both the cortex and medulla, but the reactivity for ERα was discontinuous, probably due to variable cell requirements. In the cortex, positivity was observed in cells of the ovarian surface epithelium, in germ cells and in prefollicular cells. In the medulla, positivity was found in the following cell categories: interstitial cells, poorly differentiated somatic cord cells, including those delimiting lacunae, germ cells and their accompanying cells of epithelial origin. Furthermore, the IHC results showed that the intracellular localization of the antigen was cytoplasmic, nuclear, or both. The significance of ERα presence and intracellular localization was discussed in relation and as supplementary to previous research by various Authors. In particular, as regards the unusual cytoplasmic immunoreactivity, a gradual shift of ERα localization from cytoplasmic to nuclear during the embryonic period is suggested. 3aanimal ovaries 3achicks 3acortex 3aepithelial cells 3aepithelium 3agerm cells 3aimmunohistochemistry 3aovarian development 2aAnimals 2aAntibodies, Monoclonal 2aChick Embryoxchemistryxembryology. 2aEpithelial Cellsxchemistryxcytologyxultrastructure. 2aEstrogen Receptor alphaxanalysis 2aFemale 2aGerm Cellsxchemistryxcytologyxultrastructure. 2aImmunohistochemistry 2aMicroscopy, Electron 2aOvaryxchemistryxcytologyxembryologyxultrastructure. 2aTheca Cellsxcytologyxultrastructure.1 aChimenti, C.1 aGallo, V.P.0 tAnatomia, histologia, embryologia.g2010 Dec., v. 39, no. 6 p.546-554dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0340-20967nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1439-0264.2010.01027.x 7aarticle02371naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001400128245013200142300001600274520094200290650001201232650001401244650002101258650002301279650001601302650001801318650000901336650001201345650002101357650001601378650000901394650001901403650001801422650002201440650001101462650000901473650002401482650002301506650000901529650001701538650001301555653002401568653001801592653002101610700001601631700001801647773009601665852000901761930003301770945001301803946001301816655001201829IND2040223120221119224618.0940613e199403  mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204022312DNAL7 a81165312pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRozen, R.10aEffects of cycles of food restriction followed by ad libitum refeeding on body composition and energy expenditure in obese rats  ap. 560-565.  aMale Wistar rats rendered obese by a cafeteria diet were subjected to three successive cycles alternating food restriction with ad libitum cafeteria-diet feeding (WC rats). Body composition, energy intake, energy required for maintenance, and oxygen consumption were studied. Results were compared with those for rats fed a standard stock diet (CON rats) or a cafeteria diet (CAF rats). The rate of weight loss or regain was independent of the number of cycles. WC rats were fatter than CON rats and as fat as CAF rats after the third cycle. Cost of maintenance of WC rats decreased; their oxygen consumption decreased in the lean state, increased again in the fat state, but remained lower than that of CON and CAF rats. We conclude that the practice of successive restriction and refeeding did not result in resistance to weight loss, but rather in a defect in the utilization of energy intake, facilitating the development of obesity. 3aobesity 3arepletion 3abody composition 3aenergy expenditure 3aweight gain 3aenergy intake 3arats 2aAnimals 2aBody Composition 2aBody Weight 2aDiet 2aDiet, Reducing 2aEnergy Intake 2aEnergy Metabolism 2aHumans 2aMale 2aObesityxmetabolism 2aOxygen Consumption 2aRats 2aRats, Wistar 2aThinness 0acyclic fluctuations 0aweight losses 0afood restriction1 aBrigant, L.1 aApfelbaum, M.0 tAmerican journal of clinical nutrition.g1994 Mar., v. 59, no. 3 p.560-565x0002-91657nnas  aDNAL  a19940720b19940722c00000000  aINDdHBI  aOther US 7aarticle02777naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100002000128245008500148300001600233500001500249520113800264650001201402650000901414650000801423650002901431650002001460650002501480650001701505650003201522650002401554650000901578650002201587650002401609650000901633650002201642650003801664650002801702650001101730650003501741650003201776650005301808650002601861650002801887650000901915653002201924653001001946653001601956700001401972700001901986700001802005773009602023852000902119930003302128945001302161946001302174655001202187IND2040223620221119224558.0940613e199403  mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204022362DNAL7 a81668372pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRasmussen, L.B.10aEffect of diet and plasma fatty acid composition on immune status in elderly men  ap. 572-577.  a2019-12-05  aThe relationship between fatty acids in plasma and basal (B), interleukin-2-(IL-2), and interferon-alpha (IFN-alpha)-stimulated natural killer (NK) cell activity was studied in healthy elderly men aged on average 70.5 y (65-81 y). B-NK correlated significantly with the fraction of plasma fatty acids consisting of total polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), total n-6 fatty acids, and linoleic acid (r = -0.68, r = -0.62, and r = -0.52, respectively). Significant negative correlations were also found between IFN-alpha stimulated NK cells and the three groups of fatty acids and between IL-2-stimulated NK cells and PUFAs. Likewise, negative correlations between PUFAs in the diet and B-NK, IL-2, and IFN-alpha stimulated NK cell activity were found. The number of NK cells increased significantly but NK cell activity did not change after 5 wk on a diet lower in fat but higher in PUFAs than the subjects' habitual diet. It is concluded that the amount and type of dietary fatty acids influence in vitro measures of immune function in elderly men. From an immunological point of view, a high intake of n-6 PUFAs may be inadvisable. 3aelderly 3adiet 3amen 3anutritional intervention 3aimmune response 3anatural killer cells 3ablood plasma 3apolyunsaturated fatty acids 3aomega-6 fatty acids 2aAged 2aAged, 80 and over 2aAntigens, CDxblood 2aDiet 2aEnergy Metabolism 2aFatty Acids, Nonesterifiedxblood 2aFlow Cytometryxmethods 2aHumans 2aInterferon-alphaxpharmacology 2aInterleukin-2xpharmacology 2aKiller Cells, Naturalxdrug effectsximmunology. 2aLymphocyte Activation 2aLymphocytesximmunology 2aMale 0amononuclear cells 0aaging 0ablood cells1 aKiens, B.1 aPedersen, B.K.1 aRichter, E.A.0 tAmerican journal of clinical nutrition.g1994 Mar., v. 59, no. 3 p.572-577x0002-91657nnas  aDNAL  a19940720b19940722c00000000  aINDdHBI  aOther US 7aarticle02276naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001600128245006100144300001600205520097100221650001501192650002101207650001201228650001001240650002001250650002001270650001601290650001001306650002201316650001101338650001101349650002301360650001301383650002401396650001201420650002101432650002301453650001501476651001801491653001301509700001801522700001801540700001601558700002001574773009601594852000901690930003301699945001301732946001301745655001201758IND2040223020221119224621.0940613e199403  mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204022302DNAL7 a81165302pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDietz, W.H.10aEffect of sedentary activities on resting metabolic rate  ap. 556-559.  aWe examined the effect of television viewing on resting metabolic rate (RMR) in a cohort of 9 obese and 18 nonobese girls aged 10.4 +/- 1.1 y. RMR was measured while girls watched television, read, or sat quietly for 15 min. Movement was assessed by using activity monitors and a manual count of movements observed on a videotape. Absolute RMR was greater for the obese girls, but no significant treatment effect existed for absolute RMR within either group. Although measured activity did not differ, observed movements were greater when the girls were sitting quietly. Total observed and measured movements were significantly correlated with the CV of the minute-by-minute RMR. These results suggest that television viewing does not alter RMR. Although children appear to fidget more when sitting quietly than when they read or watch television, fidgeting appears to affect the minute-to-minute variation of RMR rather than the level of resting energy expenditure. 3atelevision 3abasal metabolism 3aobesity 3agirls 3aschool children 2aBody Mass Index 2aBody Weight 2aChild 2aEnergy Metabolism 2aFemale 2aHumans 2aLeisure Activities 2aMovement 2aObesityxmetabolism 2aReading 2aReference Values 2aSkinfold Thickness 2aTelevision 3aMassachusetts 0aactivity1 aBandini, L.G.1 aMorelli, J.A.1 aPeers, K.F.1 aChing, P.L.Y.H.0 tAmerican journal of clinical nutrition.g1994 Mar., v. 59, no. 3 p.556-559x0002-91657nnas  aDNAL  a19940720b19940722c00000000  aINDdHBI  aOther US 7aarticle03787naa a2200649 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002500092040001800117072000900135072000900144072000900153072000900162100001700171245011200188300001600300500010600316500002400422520192900446650000902375650001002384650001602394650001702410650001202427650001402439650001702453650001402470650001002484650001402494650001402508650002302522650001102545650001702556650002602573650001902599650001602618650001902634650002102653650002602674650002102700650002002721650002202741650002602763653001902789700001502808700001902823700001502842700001702857773009802874852000902972856007502981930003303056945002503089946001103114655001203125IND4438381420221119224828.0100611s2010    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443838142DNAL7 a10.1071/AN091772doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL500 0aF130 0aL100 0aL6001 aKenyon, P.R.10aCan a herb and white clover mix improve the performance of multiple-bearing ewes and their lambs to weaning  ap. 513-521.  aIn the special issue: Animal production in Australia: Livestock production in a changing environment.  aIncludes references  aThe productive performance of highly fecund ewes and their progeny on ryegrass-based swards is limited in late pregnancy and lactation. Alternative herbages, such as chicory, plantain and red and white clover, have the potential to improve performance levels. In the present study, 49 twin- and 42 triplet-bearing Romney composite ewes bred to either Suffolk or Romney rams were allocated to one of three nutritional treatments from Day 131 of pregnancy [19 twin ewes on a ryegrass-white clover sward mix (Rye/WC); 16 twin ewes on a plantain-ryegrass sward mix (Plant/Rye); 14 twin ewes on a chicory-plantain-red and white clover sward mix (Herb); 13 triplet ewes on Rye/WC; 16 triplet ewes on Plant/Rye; and 13 triplet ewes on Herb] and remained on these sward treatments with their lambs until 75 days after the midpoint of the lambing period (L75). Nutritional treatment had no effect (P > 0.05) on ewe liveweight, body condition score (BCS) or non-esterified fatty acid and β-hydroxybutyrate concentrations on Day 145 of pregnancy. At L75, ewes on the Herb treatment sward were heavier than ewes on Plant/Rye (70.75 ± 1.31 v. 61.43 ± 1.28 kg, respectively) and had a higher BCS than ewes on either Plant/Rye or Rye/WC (2.7 ± 0.1, 2.2 ± 0.1 and 2.3 ± 0.1, respectively). Sire type and nutritional treatment had no affect (P > 0.05) on lamb birthweight or weight at L75. At L20, lambs born to ewes on the Herb sward treatment were heavier than those on the Rye/WC and Plant/Rye treatments (8.74 ± 0.23 v. 7.98 ± 0.23 and 7.79 ± 0.22 kg, respectively; P 0.05) on maximum heat production on a per kg liveweight basis or total heat production. Romney-sired lambs on the Herb sward treatment had higher (P 0.05) in Suffolk-sired lambs. In conclusion, the present study indicates that there is the potential to improve the productive performance of multiple-bearing ewes and their lambs by grazing on a Herb sward mix. 3aewes 3alambs 3alitter size 3afood animals 3aweaning 3amortality 3afeed rations 3afecundity 3asward 3apregnancy 3alactation 3amaternal nutrition 3aforage 3aforage crops 3abotanical composition 3apasture plants 3abody weight 3abody condition 3afree fatty acids 3a3-hydroxybutyric acid 3abody temperature 3aheat production 3abreed differences 3aSuffolk (sheep breed) 0aherb sward mix1 aKemp, P.D.1 aStafford, K.J.1 aWest, D.M.1 aMorris, S.T.0 tAnimal production science.g2010, v. 50, no. 5-6 p.513-521dCSIRO Publishingx1836-09397nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1071/AN091773Available from publisher's Web site  a20100920b20101001c00000000  aINDd2CTe2010/08/17  aNon-US 7aarticle02685naa a2200637 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100002000128245009300148300001600241500001500257520100700272650002901279650001701308650001601325650000801341650001401349650002101363650001601384650002801400650001701428650001001445650001201455650002301467650002501490650000901515650002601524650001701550650002101567650001801588650001801606650001101624650001801635650002401653650000901677650000901686650002101695650001701716650002501733653000901758700001701767700001601784700001601800700001901816700001701835700001901852773009601871852000901967930003301976945001302009946001302022655001202035IND2040225420221119224616.0940613e199403  mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204022542DNAL7 a81165372pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSteinmetz, K.A.10aEffect of consumption of whole milk and skim milk on blood lipid profiles in healthy men  ap. 612-618.  a2019-12-05  aA controlled crossover feeding study was conducted in eight males aged 20-36 y to compare the effects of skim milk and whole milk on blood lipids.

Substitution of skim milk for whole milk may decrease the risk of coronary heart disease. 3ahigh density lipoprotein 3ablood lipids 3aapoproteins 3amen 3askim milk 3atriacylglycerols 3acholesterol 3alow density lipoprotein 3ablood plasma 2aAdult 2aAnimals 2aCholesterolxblood 2aCholesterol, Dietary 2aDiet 2aDietary Carbohydrates 2aDietary Fats 2aDietary Proteins 2aEnergy Intake 2aFood Handling 2aHumans 2aLipidsxblood 2aLipoproteinsxblood 2aMale 2aMilk 2aReference Values 2aTime Factors 2aTriglyceridesxblood 0amilk1 aChilds, M.T.1 aStimson, C.1 aKushi, L.H.1 aMcGovern, P.G.1 aPotter, J.D.1 aYamanaka, W.K.0 tAmerican journal of clinical nutrition.g1994 Mar., v. 59, no. 3 p.612-618x0002-91657nnas  aDNAL  a19940720b19940722c00000000  aINDdHBI  aOther US 7aarticle03229naa a2200601 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003600111040001800147072000900165100001400174245009800188300001600286500002400302520143700326650000901763650002001772650001501792650002301807650001801830650000901848650001401857650001901871650002601890650002101916650001201937650001301949650001101962650004601973650005302019650001102072650005602083650002902139650001402168650002202182650001502204650001702219650003002236651001202266651002702278653002002305700002402325700001502349773008702364852000902451856008602460930003302546945002502579946001102604655001202615IND4432868820221119224402.0100219e201002  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443286882DNAL7 a191289892pmid7 a10.1016/j.tvjl.2008.11.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL8401 aHulek, M.10aPrevalence of digital dermatitis in first lactation cows assessed at breeding cattle auctions  ap. 161-165.  aIncludes references  aThe prevalence of digital dermatitis (DD) in first lactation cows (FLCs) presented at 10 breeding cattle auctions was determined in a single auction centre in Austria over a period of 14 months. At each auction, FLCs were selected randomly for claw examination from the monthly auction catalogue. After obtaining owner consent, the hindclaws were examined in a walk-in crush. The type of lesion (M1–M4) and the diameter of DD lesions together with claw horn lesions and the trimming status of the claws were evaluated. From a total of 1110 FLCs registered for the ten auctions, 399 (36%) were randomly chosen for examination and 199 FLCs (17.9%) could be defined. In 63 cows (15.7%), the owners refused consent. A total of 24 FLCs were found to have DD lesions on one or both hindlimbs, resulting in a DD prevalence of 12.1%. The size of lesions ranged from 0.5–3 cm in diameter. No influence of environmental factors (such as season or housing) on the prevalence of DD could be found. In 30/199 (15.1%) of FLCs examined, claw horn lesions such as double sole, white line disease and sole ulcer were observed, but both claw horn and DD lesions were seen in only three cows. Potential buyers at auctions should be aware of both conditions, as the 12.1% prevalence of DD and the 15.1% prevalence of claw horn lesions in FLCs are considerable. Critical evaluation of claw health and DD is essential when purchasing breeding cattle. 3acows 3acattle diseases 3adermatitis 3adisease prevalence 3afoot diseases 3afeet 3alactation 3abreeding stock 3aparity (reproduction) 3alesions (animal) 2aAnimals 2aBreeding 2aCattle 2aCattle Diseasesxepidemiologyxpathology. 2aDermatitisxepidemiologyxpathologyxveterinary. 2aFemale 2aFoot Diseasesxepidemiologyxpathologyxveterinary. 2aHoof and Clawxpathology 2aLactation 2aPostpartum Period 2aPrevalence 2aRisk Factors 2aSeverity of Illness Index 3aAustria 0aAustriaxepidemiology. 0acattle auctions1 aSommerfeld-Stur, I.1 aKofler, J.0 tVeterinary journal.g2010 Feb., v. 183, no. 2 p.161-165dHarcourtx1090-02337nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tvjl.2008.11.0013Available from publisher's Web site  a20100331b20100403c00000000  aINDd6CTe2010/03/12  aNon-US 7aarticle02309naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001400128245008800142300001600230500001500246520083600261650000901097650000801106650001001114650001001124650000801134650001301142650001801155650001201173650000901185650001501194650001501209650001001224650002001234650001001254650002101264650001101285650001101296650001101307650000901318650002401327650002601351650003001377650001601407650001701423653001601440653001501456700001601471700001801487700001801505700002001523773009601543852000901639930003301648945001301681946001301694655001201707IND2040215720221119224352.0940610e199404  mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204021572DNAL7 a81473242pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGuo, S.S.14aThe predictive value of childhood body mass index values for overweight at age 35 y  ap. 810-819.  a2019-12-05  aLarger body mass index values (BMI in kg/m2) are associated with increased morbidity and mortality in adulthood and there are significant correlations between BMI values in childhood and in adulthood. The present study addresses the predictive value of childhood BMI for overweight at 35 +/- 5 y, defined as BMI > 28 for men and > 26 for women. Analyses of data for 555 white children indicated that overweight at 35 y can be predicted from BMI at younger ages. The prediction is excellent at age 18 y, good at 13 y, but only moderate at ages younger than 13 y. For 18-y-olds with a BMI value exceeding the 60th percentile, the odds of overweight at 35 y are 34% for men and 37% for women. A clinically applicable method is provided to assign an overweight child to a group with a known probability of high BMI values in adulthood. 3arisk 3amen 3agirls 3awomen 3aage 3achildren 3adata analysis 3aobesity 3aboys 3aprediction 2aAdolescent 2aAdult 2aBody Mass Index 2aChild 2aChild, Preschool 2aFemale 2aHumans 2aInfant 2aMale 2aModels, Theoretical 2aObesityxepidemiology 2aPredictive Value of Tests 2aProbability 2aRisk Factors 0abody weight 0aoverweight1 aRoche, A.F.1 aChumlea, W.C.1 aGardner, J.D.1 aSiervogel, R.M.0 tAmerican journal of clinical nutrition.g1994 Apr., v. 59, no. 4 p.810-819x0002-91657nnas  aDNAL  a19940720b19940722c00000000  aINDdHBI  aOther US 7aarticle01185naa a2200277 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100001700115245004200132300001400174300002800188520042700216650001800643650000900661650001700670650002300687653002300710773009900733852000900832939003300841945000800874946001300882655001200895991570694890742620221119224352.0860611s1985    xx ||||go|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI860106452DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJensen, M.E.10aDental caries: a diet-related disease  ap. 18-21.  ap. 18-21. ill., charts.  aAn overview discusses the influence of dietary factors on dental caries incidence.

One Japanese researcher in doing so considers the dietitian and dietetics beyond the role of scientist/science. Recognizing that practical application of health care involves more than methodology and numbers, and that nutrition involves more than a collection of nutrients, other aspects are considered. Constituents of a meal involve food dishes rather than mere nutrients. This understanding is important in understanding eating habits, as is dietetics based on foodstuffs and food groupings. In conclusion, the tools of science can be used to develop a new paradigm for nutritionist/dietitian that goes outside the realm of measureable science.(jd-b) 3adietetic education 3apatient education 3aeating habits 3anutrition physiology 3amodels 3afood groups 0adietitian role0 tCurrents, the journal of food, nutrition & health.g1986, v. 2, no. 2 p.13-17x0882-79157nnas  aDNAL  a20050114b00000000c00000000  aFNC  aOther US 7aarticle03331naa a2200637 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001700094024002300111024002800134024002300162024004000185024002500225040001800250100007100268245006300339300001600402500002000418520105800438592002801496596005601524596006901580650002501649650002301674650003401697650002201731650003001753650003701783650002601820650001601846650001401862650001601876650002101892650001401913650001001927651001101937700002101948700002001969700006101989700005502050700005502105700002202160700001302182700001902195700002102214700006502235700002102300700002302321773012602344856011402470856007502584961001302659852000902672655001202681IND60770942220221214223758.0220820e202101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077094222DNAL7 a3772132aris7 a10113/77094222hdl7 a10.1002/plr2.201062doi7 a3772132seq_no_1157 a3020-21000-011-00D2aris_project_no7 a4342942aris_accn_no  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCheung, Leslie,d1956-2003,1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1342-857810aRegistration of ‘KS Silverado’ hard white winter wheat  ap. 147-153.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  a‘KS Silverado’ (Reg. no. CV‐1175, PI 693936) hard white winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) was developed at the Agricultural Research Center–Hays, Kansas State University, and released by the Kansas Agricultural Experiment Station in 2019. KS Silverado was selected from a three‐way cross KS05HW122‐5‐2//KS05HW15‐2‐2/KS06HW46‐3 made in 2008 at Hays, KS. The objective of this cross was to develop a hard white winter wheat cultivar that is adapted to Kansas. KS Silverado was selected as an F₆–derived line using a modified bulk method and tested in yield trials across Kansas for five years. KS Silverado is medium‐early and medium‐short and has good straw strength, above average grain volume weight, and very competitive grain yield in western and central Kansas. KS Silverado is tolerant to preharvest sprouting and has a good resistance package to diseases and insects, including Wheat streak mosaic virus, leaf rust, Soilborne wheat mosaic virus, and Hessian fly. It also has good milling and bread‐making qualities.  aPublisher supplied data  a1017084cNational Institute of Food and Agriculture  a2017‐67007‐25939cNational Institute of Food and Agriculture 3aMayetiola destructor 3aPuccinia recondita 3aSoil-borne wheat mosaic virus 3aTriticum aestivum 3aWheat streak mosaic virus 3aagricultural experiment stations 3aagricultural research 3abreadmaking 3acultivars 3agrain yield 3ahard white wheat 3aleaf rust 3astraw 3aKansas1 aMartin, Terry J.1 aFritz, Allan K.1 aBowden, Robert L.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9419-65741 aLi, Yonghui1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4320-08061 aBai, Guihua1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1194-319X1 aChen, Ming‐Shun1 aJin, Yue1 aChen, Xianming1 aKolmer, James A.1 aSeabourn, Bradford W.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5475-66261 aChen, Richard Y.1 aMarshall, David S.0 tJournal of plant registrations.g2021 Jan., v. 15, no. 1 p.147-153dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:6195x1936-52097nnas40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/77094223Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/plr2.201063Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/ARS  aDNAL 7aarticle03378naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100003100188245010200219300001600321506007600337520162700413592002802040506003702068650002002105650001302125650001402138650001602152650001202168650002202180650002202202650001302224650001602237650001502253650002102268650001702289650001502306650002202321650001702343650002502360653001502385653002202400653002202422653002402444653002102468653001602489700003002505700002302535700001902558700002402577773010802601856008202709852000902791655001202800IND60561887820221207093704.0190403e20170201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056188782DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fcr.2016.11.0042doi7 aPMC52216702pmcid7 a281633612pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRamamoorthy, Purushothaman10aRoot traits confer grain yield advantages under terminal drought in chickpea (Cicer arietinum L.)  ap. 146-161.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aChickpea, the second most important legume crop, suffers major yield losses by terminal drought stress (DS). Stronger root system is known to enhance drought yields but this understanding remains controversial. To understand precisely the root traits contribution towards yield, 12 chickpea genotypes with well-known drought response were field evaluated under drought and optimal irrigation. Root traits, such as root length density (RLD), total root dry weight (RDW), deep root dry weight (deep RDW) and root:shoot ratio (RSR), were measured periodically by soil coring up to 1.2m soil depth across drought treatments. Large variations were observed for RLD, RDW, deep RDW and RSR in both the drought treatments. DS increased RLD below 30cm soil depth, deep RDW, RSR but decreased the root diameter. DS increased the genetic variation in RDW more at the penultimate soil depths. Genetic variation under drought was the widest for RLD ∼50 DAS, for deep RDW ∼50–75 DAS and for RSR at 35 DAS. Genotypes ICC 4958, ICC 8261, Annigeri, ICC 14799, ICC 283 and ICC 867 at vegetative stage and genotypes ICC 14778, ICCV 10, ICC 3325, ICC 14799 and ICC 1882 at the reproductive phase produced greater RLD. Path- and correlation coefficients revealed strong positive contributions of RLD after 45 DAS, deep RDW at vicinity of maturity and RSR at early podfill stages to yield under drought. Breeding for the best combination of profuse RLD at surface soil depths, and RDW at deeper soil layers, was proposed to be the best selection strategy, for an efficient water use and an enhanced terminal drought tolerance in chickpea.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aCicer arietinum 3abreeding 3achickpeas 3acorrelation 3adrought 3adrought tolerance 3agenetic variation 3agenotype 3agrain yield 3airrigation 3aroot shoot ratio 3aroot systems 3asoil depth 3avegetative growth 3awater stress 3awater use efficiency 0aDeep roots 0aDrought tolerance 0aField phenotyping 0aRoot length density 0aRoot:shoot ratio 0aSoil coring1 aLakshmanan, Krishnamurthy1 aUpadhyaya, Hari D.1 aVadez, Vincent1 aVarshney, Rajeev K.0 tField crops research.g2017 Feb. 01, v. 201 p.146-161dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl10215x0378-42907nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fcr.2016.11.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02395naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002300146245012700169300001800296520131200314592002801626653003001654653002001684653002801704653002601732653001701758653001601775653002701791653001901818700002601837773011501863856008201978852000902060655001202069IND60128690220221118045553.0151116e200712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012869022DNAL7 a10.1644/06-MAMM-A-382R.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWhorley, Joshua R.10aVariation in Reproductive Patterns of Antelope Ground Squirrels, Ammospermophilus leucurus, from Oregon to Baja California  ap. 1404-1411.  aClines of biological variation result from variation in physical environmental conditions. We report new reproductive data for a population of antelope ground squirrels, Ammospermophilus leucurus, at the northern geographic limit of this species. We then analyze reproductive patterns at 3 sites spanning the entire north––south extent of the geographic range, covering more than 2,500 km and 21 degrees of latitude. The overall breeding season of populations is relatively short in Oregon (42°°N) and California (37°°N), but in Baja California (24°°N) it encompasses half a year. Mean litter size decreases significantly from north to south, from 9.3 (SD == 1.8) per litter in Oregon to 5.9 (SD == 1.5) in Baja California. Major shifts in seasonality of precipitation and ecosystem composition and diversity are associated with longer breeding season and lower litter size at the southern geographic extreme of A. leucurus. The environmental predictability for the northern populations is due to ““constancy,”” whereas the predictability at the southern extreme is due to ““contingency.”” The observed latitudinal reproductive patterns represent local responses of populations to environmental conditions and the related characteristics of North America's major desert ecosystems.  aPublisher supplied data 0aAmmospermophilus leucurus 0abreeding season 0aenvironmental variation 0alatitudinal variation 0alife history 0alitter size 0aNorth American deserts 0apredictability1 aKenagy, George James,0 tJournal of mammalogy.g2007 Dec., v. 88, no. 6 p.1404-1411dAmerican Society of Mammalogists.x1545-15427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1644%2F06-MAMM-A-382R.13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03012naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100005500150245009000205300001400295520159300309592002801902650002101930650001001951650002401961650002701985650001702012650001202029650002902041650001602070650002002086650001202106650002902118650001602147653002702163653002002190653002702210653001402237653002202251700001302273700001702286700001402303700001302317773011802330856008502448852000902533655001202542IND60540463220221118000917.0190318e201505  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054046322DNAL7 a10.1016/j.pestbp.2015.01.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Nannan1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3088-938710aCytochrome P450s – Their expression, regulation, and role in insecticide resistance  ap. 77-81.  aP450s are known to be critical for the detoxification and/or activation of xenobiotics such as drugs and pesticides and overexpression of P450 genes can significantly affect the disposition of xenobiotics in the tissues of organisms, altering their pharmacological/toxicological effects. In insects, P450s play an important role in detoxifying exogenous compounds such as insecticides and plant toxins and their overexpression can result in increased levels of P450 proteins and P450 activities. This has been associated with enhanced metabolic detoxification of insecticides and has been implicated in the development of insecticide resistance in insects. Multiple P450 genes have been found to be co-overexpressed in individual insect species via several constitutive overexpression and induction mechanisms, which in turn are co-responsible for high levels of insecticide resistance. Many studies have also demonstrated that the transcriptional overexpression of P450 genes in resistant insects is regulated by trans and/or cis regulatory genes/factors. Taken together, these earlier findings suggest not only that insecticide resistance is conferred via multi-resistance P450 genes, but also that it is mediated through the interaction of regulatory genes/factors and resistance genes. This chapter reviews our current understanding of how the molecular mechanisms of P450 interaction/gene regulation govern the development of insecticide resistance in insects and our progress along the road to a comprehensive characterization of P450 detoxification-mediated insecticide resistance.  aPublisher supplied data 3acytochrome P-450 3adrugs 3agene overexpression 3ainsecticide resistance 3ainsecticides 3ainsects 3ametabolic detoxification 3aphytotoxins 3aregulator genes 3atissues 3atranscription (genetics) 3axenobiotics 0aInsecticide resistance 0aCytochrome P450 0aInteraction/regulation 0aInduction 0aHomology modeling1 aLi, Ming1 aGong, Youhui1 aLiu, Feng1 aLi, Ting0 tPesticide biochemistry and physiology.g2015 May, v. 120 p.77-81dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl1414x0048-35757nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.pestbp.2015.01.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03521naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100006900139245016900208500002000377520158100397592002801978596006802006650001302074650001502087650000902102650002102111650001102132650001802143650002602161650001102187650001102198650001802209650001602227650001802243650002002261650001502281650001602296651001102312700006702323700006402390700007402454700008102528700006102609700007402670700007402744773011402818856007402932852000903006655001203015IND60780446220221121022124.0220620e202206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078044622DNAL7 a10.1111/lre.124002doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCorrêa, Raphael Ferreira1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5410-167010aFirst report of the invasive Ceratium furcoides (dinoflagellate) in Paracambi Reservoir, Rio de Janeiro: Risks to the world's largest domestic water treatment plant  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aCeratium furcoides (Dinophyta) have gained international attention as invasive aquatic species, especially in South America, due to its fast proliferation into various aquatic systems and the subsequent adverse impacts on water quality and native biota. The present study reports the detection of dense populations of C. furcoides in the Paracambi Small Hydropower Plant (SHP) located in the Guandu River basin. Sampling was conducted at five sites during two sampling events in 2019 and 2020 during different seasons (spring and summer), respectively. We used two different standardized sampling methods, including surface collections (SS) (100‐ml) traditionally used for quantitative analysis of inland water phytoplankton, as well as filtration of 20‐L sub‐surface water (FS) through a zooplankton net. The cell densities were higher in SS (599 individuals/ml) than in FS (0.068 individuals/ml), possibly indicating a patchy distribution of Ceratium in the surface water layers. The total cell length exhibited high values (mean length of 249‐μm; mean width of 67‐μm), possibly accounting for water treatment impairment, an inability of zooplankton to consume them and/or fish gill clogging. This new observation within an extensively investigated area, and a source of water for nine million people, in the present study advocates for integrated samplings that also consider a search for cysts accumulated in the bottom sediments, as well as more detailed spatial and temporal investigations considering the salient features of C. furcoides’ populations.  aPublisher supplied data  cCoordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior 3aCeratium 3afiltration 3afish 3ainvasive species 3apeople 3aphytoplankton 3aquantitative analysis 3aspring 3asummer 3asurface water 3awater power 3awater quality 3awater treatment 3awatersheds 3azooplankton 3aBrazil1 aMacêdo, Rafael Lacerda1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5086-01701 aFonseca, Kauan Nunes1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4728-48831 aThiago, Mariana Guedes Ribeiro1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7710-78081 aMiranda, Viviane Bernardes dos Santos1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5571-82931 aOrsi, Mario Luis1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9545-49851 aPortugal, Samira da Guia Mello1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3619-36791 aBranco, Christina Wyss Castelo1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0509-171X0 tLakes & reservoirs.g2022 June, v. 27, no. 2 p.e12400-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:2144x1320-53317nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/lre.124003Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02611naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003400092024002200126024001900148040001800167100001800185245009700203300001600300506007600316520085300392536013501245592002801380506003701408650001901445650001901464650002401483650001901507650001501526650001101541650001601552650002101568650001301589650001701602650002101619650001601640650001201656650001101668653003001679653003401709653002101743653003001764700002501794700001901819700002101838773013201859856008101991852000902072655001202081IND4470180920221207070953.0181016e201201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447018092DNAL7 a10.1177/10406387114259512doi7 aPMC43535932pmcid7 a223629522pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, David X.10aDouble-outlet right ventricle and double septal defects in a Rhesus macaque (Macaca mulatta)  ap. 188-191.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aA 6-year-old male India-origin Rhesus macaque (Macaca mulatta) presented with thin body condition and muscular atrophy.

Fifty‐seven phytochemical compounds are identified in H. perforatum and S. cordifolia aqueous extracts by UPLC‐QTOF MSᴱ. Both herbal aqueous extracts ameliorate hepatic steatosis. S. cordifolia modulates arachidonic acid, 16:0‐, 16:1‐, and 18:0‐derived TAG, ceramides, and diacylglycerols, regulating the expression of genes involved in fatty acid (Fas, Acc, and Scd1), diacylglyceride (Gpat) and ceramide (Spt1) biosynthesis, and β‐oxidation (Cpt1 and Acadm). H. perforatum regulates eicosapentanoic acid metabolism, which is associated with Fabp down‐regulation. Both extracts reduce hepatic TNF‐α and IL‐6 levels, which is associated with eicosanoid pathway regulation by S. cordifolia and the modulation of phosphatidylcholines and phosphatidylethanolamines by H. perforatum. These results suggest that these aqueous extracts can be used as ingredients for the elaboration of functional beverages with hepatoprotective effects. Practical Applications: This study proposes a lipidomic approach followed by the integration of metabolic networks for the identification of the mechanisms associated with the hepatoprotective effect of herbal extracts. The results obtained in this study demonstrate the beneficial effect of S. cordifolia and H. perforatum aqueous extracts on hepatic steatosis in high‐fat and fructose diet‐fed obese rats. Therefore, these herbs can be used for the elaboration of functional beverages. H. perforatum and S. cordifolia aqueous extracts ameliorate hepatic steatosis in obese rats. A liver lipidome approach is used to identify the mechanisms associated with their hepatoprotective effect by integrating metabolic networks. H. perforatum decreases Fabp hepatic expression which is associated mainly with decreased hepatic EPA. S. cordifolia decreased Fasn, Acaca, Scd1, Gpat1, and Spt1 and increased Cpt1 and Acadm hepatic expressiobm which is associated mainly with increased AA.

The timing and frequency of alfalfa hay harvesting have implications on its quality and quantity. With ever-increasing capability, it is possible to use satellite remote sensing data to monitor alfalfa harvests. This study investigated the potential of using satellite remote sensing to capture frequent harvesting events on an alfalfa field in central Oklahoma. Both passive remote sensing data, namely Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), Landsat-7 and -8, Sentinel-2, Harmonized Landsat and Sentinel-2 (HLS), and active remote sensing data, namely Sentinel-1, were included. Our results indicate that good quality optical remote sensing datasets (i.e., cloud and cloud shadow free) with both fine spatial (≤100 m) and high temporal (effective observation at 8-day intervals or better) resolutions are necessary to detect frequent alfalfa harvesting events, challenged by possible adverse weather conditions and quick regrowth of vegetation after harvest. Landsat (7 and 8) and Sentinel-2 were more sensitive to changes in vegetation indices after harvest than MODIS due to their higher spatial resolutions, which helped avoid the mixed pixel issue in MODIS caused by its coarser spatial resolution (∼500 m). Combining Landsat (7 and 8) with Sentinel-2 imageries through linear regression between the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) values, up to one week apart, increased the accuracy of detecting frequent alfalfa harvesting events. The responses of HLS to alfalfa harvesting events were similar with fused Landsat and Sentinel-2 data using their linear relationship of NDVI values. However, the high noise level in the HLS data needs to be minimized before it can be used to detect alfalfa harvests at the regional scale. In most cases, both Sentinel-1 radar backscatter coefficients (vertical transmit and vertical receive, VV + vertical transmit and horizontal receive, VH) and interferometric coherence from Sentinel-1 Simple Look Complex (SLC) data were decreased by harvesting events in small incident angle observations (34.31°). No consistent relationships existed between backscatter or coherence and alfalfa harvests in larger incident angle observations (45.11°). Future studies should focus on small incident angle observations instead of processing all of the radar data, which has big data volume and is time-consuming. Overall, active radar has the potential to detect alfalfa harvesting events. However, it is visually less intuitive than optical data with incident angles, quantity harvested, and soil moisture being the compounding factors. This study illustrates that combining multiple optical sensors with a fine spatial resolution (e.g., Landsat-7, 8, and Sentinel-2) and/or fusing radar with optical remote sensing to increase the temporal resolution are promising approaches to detect frequent alfalfa harvesting events and other hay harvesting activities.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aLandsat 3aMedicago sativa 3aalfalfa 3aalfalfa hay 3aangle of incidence 3acarbon 3achlorophyll 3adata collection 3aeddy covariance 3aforage 3ainterferometry 3alivestock and meat industry 3anormalized difference vegetation index 3aradar 3aregression analysis 3aregrowth 3asoil water 3aspatial data 3asurveys 3avegetation 3aweather 3aOklahoma 0aOptical remote sensing 0aRadar 0aData fusion 0aSpatial and temporal resolutions 0aCrop monitoring1 aFlynn, K.

In numerous rural regions of Mexico, over time, groups of peasants have constructed a close relationship with their natural environment permitting the development of complex home gardens, built on local ecological knowledge, preferences, beliefs, norms and values that indirectly conserve high levels of biocultural diversity. For this reason, the aim of the present work was to study the context, functions and the elements that integrate the traditional management system of Laelia anceps subsp. dawsonii f. chilapensis (known locally as “calaverita”) and the relation between modes of transmission of knowledge and the conservation of calaverita in the region of Chilapa in Guerrero, Mexico. The results show that the calaverita traditional management system is functioning as an unconscious, undervalued but highly effective and cheap biocultural conservation model that can be systematized through a circa situm approach that applies specific circumstances for conservation, in which populations of the target species are located exclusively within farming systems (such as home gardens and agroforestry systems), outside the strict habitat but within the natural geographic distribution range of the species. It links developing and strengthening of the user’s livelihoods with the guiding decision-making for sustainable management of plant genetic resources.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLaelia 3aagroforestry 3abiodiversity 3achemical elements 3adecision making 3aenvironment 3aenvironmental knowledge 3ageographical distribution 3ahabitats 3ahome gardens 3alivelihood 3amanagement systems 3amodels 3apeasantry 3aplant genetic resources 3apopulation 3arural areas 3aMexico1 aCampos Contreras, Jorge E.1 aMacías-Cuéllar, Humberto1 aDelgado-Alvarado, Adriana1 aSalazar-Rojas, Victor Manuel1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0099-66990 tEnvironment, development and sustainability.g2020 Mar., v. 22, no. 3 p.1913-1927dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl3870050x1387-585X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10668-018-0270-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02225naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245008800168300001800256520129300274592002801567653002401595653001501619653002601634653002501660653002001685700002301705773011501728856008301843852000901926655001201935IND60128690520221118045456.0151116e200712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012869052DNAL7 a10.1644/06-MAMM-A-404R1.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSharpe, David J.10aHome Range of the Australian Squirrel Glider, Petaurus norfolcensis (Diprotodontia)  ap. 1515-1522.  aKnowledge of the home range of threatened species is basic to their management and conservation. We describe the home range of the squirrel glider (Petaurus norfolcensis), a threatened marsupial, in the central part of its geographic range in eastern Australia. Thirteen individuals belonging to 6 monogamous social groups were radiotracked for 2––9 months. The adaptive kernel (AK95%%) estimate reached an asymptote at approximately 30 locations, giving a mean area of 6.2 ha ±± 0.6 SE for the 9 gliders with >30 locations. The AK50%% averaged 0.9 ±± 0.2 ha, indicating that small core parts of the home range were used intensively. Home ranges of group members (AK95%%) showed a high degree of overlap (77%%) and when combined averaged 6.7 ±± 1.0 ha. They overlapped substantially (50%%) with adjacent glider groups but core areas (AK50%%) within them overlapped by only 12%%. Two of 5 available habitats were well represented in all group home ranges. Habitat dominated by coast banksia (Banksia integrifolia), a key winter nectar food resource, was overrepresented compared to its availability. Conservation measures for this species involving habitat retention or restoration must be informed by recognition of what comprises a preferred local habitat and its distribution.  aPublisher supplied data 0ahabitat composition 0ahome range 0aPetaurus norfolcensis 0aspatial organization 0asquirrel glider1 aGoldingay, Ross L.0 tJournal of mammalogy.g2007 Dec., v. 88, no. 6 p.1515-1522dAmerican Society of Mammalogists.x1545-15427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1644%2F06-MAMM-A-404R1.13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03484naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002900149245011900178506010400297506007600401520158200477592002802059506003702087650001602124650002102140650002202161650002202183650002502205650001702230650001602247650002202263650001602285650001702301650000902318650001302327650002102340650001502361650003902376653001402415653002402429653002402453653001602477700002102493700003502514700002002549700003002569700002302599700003002622700007302652773011202725856008402837852000902921655001202930IND60778023920221207122751.0220614e202207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077802392DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jplph.2022.1537302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMartins-Noguerol, Raquel10aCharacterization and impact of sunflower plastidial octanoyltransferases (Helianthus annuus L.) on oil composition  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aProsthetic lipoyl groups are essential for the metabolic activity of several multienzyme complexes in most organisms. In plants, octanoyltransferase (LIP2) and lipoyl synthase (LIP1) enzymes in the mitochondria and plastids participate in the de novo synthesis of lipoic acid, and in the attachment of the lipoyl cofactors to their specific targets. In plastids, the lipoylated pyruvate dehydrogenase complex catalyzes the synthesis of the acetyl-CoA that is required for de novo fatty acid synthesis. Since lipoic acid transport across plastid membranes has not been demonstrated, these organelles require specific plastidial LIP1 and LIP2 activities for the in situ synthesis of this cofactor. Previously, one essential LIP1 enzyme and two redundant LIP2 enzymes have been identified within Arabidopsis chloroplasts. In this study, two plastidial sunflower (Helianthus annuus L.) LIP2 genes (HaLIP2p1 and HaLIP2p2) were identified, cloned and characterized. The expression of these genes in different tissues was studied and the tertiary structure of the peptides they encode was modeled by protein docking. These genes were overexpressed in Escherichia coli and their impact on bacterial fatty acid synthesis was studied. Finally, transgenic Arabidopsis plants overexpressing HaLIP2p1 were generated and their seed lipid profiles analyzed. The lipid composition of the transgenic seeds, particularly their TAG species, differed from that of wild-type plants, revealing a relationship between lipoic acid synthesis and the accumulation of storage lipids in Arabidopsis seeds.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aArabidopsis 3aEscherichia coli 3aHelianthus annuus 3aacetyl coenzyme A 3abiochemical pathways 3achloroplasts 3afatty acids 3alipid composition 3alipoic acid 3amitochondria 3aoils 3apeptides 3aplant physiology 3aprostheses 3apyruvate dehydrogenase (lipoamide) 0aSunflower 0aOctanoyltransferase 0aProtein lipoylation 0aLipoic acid1 aAcket, Sebastien1 aTroncoso-Ponce, Manuel Adrián1 aGarcés, Rafael1 aVenegas-Calerón, Mónica1 aSalas, Joaquín J.1 aMartínez Force, Enrique,1 aMoreno-Pérez, Antonio Javier1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4908-89580 tJournal of plant physiology.g2022 July, v. 274 p.153730-dElsevier GmbHwJournal:jnl39020x0176-16177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jplph.2022.1537303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02360naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002300094024002800117024002300145024004000168024002500208040001800233100005700251245005400308500002000362520081600382592002801198650002901226650001801255650001501273650002501288650001501313650001901328650001201347650001301359650002301372700006001395700005301455700001601508700005201524773012701576856011401703856007501817961001301892852000901905655001201914IND60770943220221120115011.0220826s2020    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077094322DNAL7 a10113/77094322hdl7 a10.1002/ael2.200392doi7 a3775922seq_no_1157 a5062-12130-007-00D2aris_project_no7 a4324192aris_accn_no  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSpokas, K.

However, there is a lack of extensive data on its sorption and factors that control its sorption in the soil system. In this study, we evaluated a series of 25 different soils, with a variety of properties to determine if an empirical relationship could be developed to predict the sorption coefficient for bicyclopyrone. Overall, there were no statistically significant relationships observed with organic carbon, cation exchange capacity, or clay content. There was a moderate negative correlation with soil pH (R = −.61). Additionally, Freundlich isotherm analysis suggests that the partitioning coefficient (KD) value could adequately characterize the sorption behavior for the range of soils evaluated here.  aPublisher supplied data 3acation exchange capacity 3aclay fraction 3adesorption 3aherbicide resistance 3aherbicides 3aorganic carbon 3asoil pH 3asorption 3asorption isotherms1 aSchneider, S.

A subgroup of NAFLD patients shows liver cell injury and inflammation coupled with the excessive fat accumulation (steatohepatitis), which is referred to as non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). Patients with NASH may develop cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). NAFLD shares the key features of metabolic syndrome including obesity, hyperlipidemia, hypertension, and insulin resistance. The pathogenesis of NAFLD is multi-factorial, however the oxidative stress seems to plays a major role in the development and progression of the disease. The emerging field of epigenetics provides a new perspective on the pathogenesis of NAFLD. Epigenetics is an inheritable but reversible phenomenon that affects gene expression without altering the DNA sequence and refers to DNA methylation, histone modifications and microRNAs. Epigenetic manipulation through metabolic pathways such as one-carbon metabolism has been proposed as a promising approach to retard the progression of NAFLD. Investigating the epigenetic modifiers in NAFLD may also lead to the development of preventive or therapeutic strategies for NASH-associated complications.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDNA 3aDNA methylation 3aalcohols 3abiochemical pathways 3adisease course 3aepigenetics 3afatty liver 3agene expression 3ahepatocytes 3ahepatoma 3ahistones 3ahyperlipidemia 3ahypertension 3ainflammation 3ainheritance (genetics) 3ainsulin resistance 3aliver 3ametabolic syndrome 3ametabolism 3amicroRNA 3anucleotide sequences 3anutrition 3aobesity 3aoxidative stress 3apathogenesis 3apatients 3atherapeutics 3atriacylglycerols1 aFriso, Simonetta1 aChoi, Sang-Woon0 tNutrients.g2014 Aug. 21, v. 6, no. 8 p.3303-3325dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2271x2072-66437nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/nu60833033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03272naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100006100139245008700200500002000287520189000307592002802197596009002225650001702315650000902332650001802341650002002359650001502379650001902394650000702413650003102420650001502451650002002466650001402486650001302500650000902513650000902522650001302531650001702544650001902561651001002580700002702590773011402617856007402731852000902805655001202814IND60780446520221121032250.0220620e202206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078044652DNAL7 a10.1111/lre.124042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAbagale, Felix K.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3507-596110aPhysicochemical quality of reservoir sediment in irrigation dams of Northern Ghana  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe present study assessed the physicochemical quality of irrigation dam reservoir sediment deposits for possible use in enriching soils in Northern Ghana. The surface area of the 9 study reservoirs was divided into upstream, midstream and downstream sections, with 18 undisturbed sediment samples taken at 0–30 cm depth for determining the soil dry bulk density, and 30 samples collected for analysis of particle size distribution, pH, macronutrients, CEC, EC, ESP and SAR. Reservoir sediments were rich in plant macronutrients (K, Ca and Mg) and organic matter and high in silt and clay content. The dry bulk density ranged from 1.10 ± 0.02 g/cm³ to 1.39 ± 0.08 g/cm³, while the sediment particle sizes were 10.3%–24.8% sand, 43.7%–53.1% silt and 30.6%–37.8% clay. The sediment pH ranged from a moderately acidic level of 5.48–6.64, with high levels of organic carbon (1.37%–2.96%) and organic matter (2.36%–5.10%). The total nitrogen (N) was found to be low (0.14%–0.29%), while the phosphorus (P) ranged from 2.6% to 4.9%, about 10 times higher than the FAO recommended normal average range. Except for the potassium (K) in two of the present study reservoirs, the exchangeable bases concentrations in the sediments were within acceptable levels for crop production. The CEC values were within moderate levels (13.69 to 29.84 cmol/kg), corresponding to a non‐expanding, chemically inactive clay, while the salinity and sodicity were absent, with the EC varying between 0.03 and 0.27 dS/m and ESP ranging from 1.8% to 12.9%. Pearson's correlation analyses indicated both positive and negative relationships among the various physicochemical parameters. Based on the present study results, desilted irrigation reservoir sediments, being rich in all plant nutrients, except for N, appear to have great potential to enhance crop production for farmers.  aPublisher supplied data  cWest African Centre for Water, Irrigation and Sustainable Agriculture (WACWISA)‐UDS 3abulk density 3aclay 3aclay fraction 3acrop production 3airrigation 3aorganic carbon 3apH 3aparticle size distribution 3aphosphorus 3aplant nutrition 3apotassium 3asalinity 3asand 3asilt 3asodicity 3asurface area 3atotal nitrogen 3aGhana1 aAdongo, Thomas Apusiga0 tLakes & reservoirs.g2022 June, v. 27, no. 2 p.e12404-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:2144x1320-53317nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/lre.124043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02565naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245012200165300001800287500001400305520124100319592002801560650001201588650001501600650001301615650001401628650001601642650002501658650001401683650002101697650001501718650001001733650001701743650001901760650002201779650001001801650002001811650002201831651001601853700001501869773014501884856008102029852000902110655001202119IND60684818520221120043001.0200222e202003  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068481852DNAL7 a10.1007/s10668-018-0272-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYavari, S.

The Neka power plant uses the Caspian Sea to cool its machines, and then the return water is discharged directly from the power plant into the sea. So far, no precise, economical method has been provided for detecting thermal pollution in marine resources in the previous studies. Therefore, this paper proposes a method for detection of thermal pollution through remote sensing and satellite imagery. Landsat 8 can calculate the water temperature with the OLI and TIRS sensors. In this study, the water temperature around the Neka power plant was calculated at the eastern channel (the water inlet channel from the sea to the power plant) and the western channel (the water outlet channel from the power plant to the sea) in two different images using the separate window algorithm in MATLAB. The results indicated an increase in the temperature in the western channel. For the western channel, the mean and highest temperatures on May 26, 2015, were 292.7 K and 294.3 K and were 300.5 K and 303.4 K on April 10, 2016. Based on the results, this can have environmental impacts due to water thermal pollution.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLandsat 3aalgorithms 3abehavior 3adetection 3aenvironment 3aenvironmental impact 3aequipment 3amarine resources 3amonitoring 3apaper 3apower plants 3aremote sensing 3athermal pollution 3awater 3awater resources 3awater temperature 3aCaspian Sea1 aQaderi, F.0 tEnvironment, development and sustainability.g2020 Mar., v. 22, no. 3 p.1953-1975dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl3870050x1387-585X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10668-018-0272-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02023naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100002300141245016600164300001800330500001900348520046100367592002800828650002600856650002100882650001800903650002100921650001200942650003000954650001000984650002000994653001301014653002001027653003601047653002001083653003801103700001701141700002301158700002301181700002001204700001901224700002201243700002001265773018401285856007501469852000901544655001201553IND60691942420221118105105.0200502e20020101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069194242DNAL7 a10.1271/bbb.66.16102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHASHIMOTO, Takashi10aSuppressive Effect of Polysaccharides from the Edible and Medicinal Mushrooms, Lentinus edodes and Agaricus blazei, on the Expression of Cytochrome P450s in Mice  ap. 1610-1614.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aTo investigate the effects of lentinan from Lentinas edodes and polysaccharides from Agaricus blazei (ABPS) on the expression of cytochrome P450s (CYPs), lentinan (10 mg/kg/day) or ABPS (200 mg/kg/day) was administered to female BALB/c mice four times every other day by intraperitoneal injection.

In this report, we found that YCWE treatment triggered rice cell suspension cultures to accumulate phenylalanine (Phe), cis-12-oxo-phytodienoic acid (OPDA), 12-hydroxyjasmonoyle isoleucine (12OHJA-Ile), and azelaic acid (AzA). YCWE treatment also reduced endogenous triacylglycerol (TG) content. The addition of ¹³C-uniform-labeled oleic, linoleic and linolenic acids to the rice cell suspension cultures gave rise to ¹³C-uniform-labeled AzA. It was also found that YCWE treatment for Arabidopsis thaliana resulted in accumulations of OPDA, AzA, Phe, and camalexin together with enhanced resistance against Botrytis cinerea infection. This suggested that YCWE treatment upon plants may activate JA and AzA signaling systems to induce plant disease resistance.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3aBotrytis cinerea 3abiotechnology 3acell walls 3agene expression 3aisoleucine 3aphenylalanine 3aplant disease resistance 3arice 3atriacylglycerols 3ayeasts 0ayeast cell wall extract 0acis-12-oxo-phytodienoic acid 0aazelaic acid 0arice cell suspension culture1 aKinami, Tomohisa1 aIshida, Tetsuya1 aYasuhara, Takaomi1 aTakahashi, Kosaku1 aMatsuura, Hideyuki0 tBioscience, biotechnology, and biochemistry.g2017 Nov. 2, v. 81, no. 11 p.2071-2078dTaylor & FranciswJournal:18959x1347-69477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09168451.2017.13793513Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03451naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001700094024002300111024002800134024002300162024004000185024002500225040001800250100006000268245012300328300001600451500002000467520159200487592002802079650001602107650001402123650001602137650000902153650002602162650001102188650002402199650000902223650001702232650003102249650002302280650000902303650002002312650001902332650001502351651001102366700006702377700006702444700005702511773013002568856011402698856007502812961001302887852000902900655001202909IND60770943520221214223756.0220811e202105  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077094352DNAL7 a3776912aris7 a10113/77094352hdl7 a10.1002/jeq2.202082doi7 a3776912seq_no_1157 a3012-21610-003-00D2aris_project_no7 a4365752aris_accn_no  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWeeks, Joseph J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4957-679410aPotential human inhalation exposure to soil contaminants in urban gardens on brownfields sites: A breath of fresh air?  ap. 782-790.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aUrban gardening has been experiencing increased popularity around the world. Many urban gardens are located on sites that may be contaminated by trace elements or organic compounds due to previous use. The three main exposure pathways to the human body for soil contaminants are (a) ingestion of soil directly, (b) consumption of produce containing or superficially contaminated with a contaminant, (c) and inhalation of soil dust. The first two modes have received much attention; however, the contribution of the inhalation route has not been investigated adequately. Two inhalation risk studies were carried out in urban gardens located in Kansas City, MO, by collecting dust while 25‐m² plots were rototilled. Microclimatic variables were monitored, and total inhalable dust mass was determined using a personal sampling train including a small pump and air filter. Soil lead (Pb) concentration was assessed at both sites. For Study 1, particle size distribution of collected particles was estimated through analysis of scanning electron microscope images of filters. Little dust was collected at either site. Most particles captured, however, appeared to be <4 μm in diameter. The amount of dust emitted was correlated with soil moisture. Tilling reduced soil aggregate size and blended soil, resulting in a more homogeneous distribution of Pb. Dust inhalation while tilling is likely not a major Pb exposure risk for gardeners, but given the preponderance of very small particles in what was captured, care should be taken to prevent dust from entering the respiratory system.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair filters 3abreathing 3abrownfields 3adust 3aenvironmental quality 3ahumans 3ainhalation exposure 3alead 3amicroclimate 3aparticle size distribution 3arespiratory system 3arisk 3asoil aggregates 3asoil pollution 3asoil water 3aKansas1 aHettiarachchi, Ganga M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6669-28851 aSantos Alvite, Eduardo,1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6767-51231 aTatarko, John1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1295-32900 tJournal of environmental quality.g2021 May, v. 50, no. 3 p.782-790dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl1642x0047-24257nnas40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/77094353Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jeq2.202083Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/ARS  aDNAL 7aarticle02734naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100006100150245017400211300001800385520131500403592002801718650000801746650001201754650001901766650002001785650001501805650001301820650001401833650001701847650001301864650001201877650001101889650001101900650001401911650002201925650001501947650001601962653001201978653001401990653001702004653001302021653001502034653001702049773009202066856008502158852000902243655001202252IND60581770720221117193704.0180830e20161201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058177072DNAL7 a10.1016/j.energy.2016.10.0372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChaurasia, Ashish1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1885-122810aModeling, simulation and optimization of downdraft gasifier: Studies on chemical kinetics and operating conditions on the performance of the biomass gasification process  ap. 1065-1076.  aThe cracking of tar from rice husk pyrolysis is examined using tar reaction conditions similar to gasification and combustion because of the practical importance of tar cracking in the modeling of biomass gasification processes. Experiments have been performed in a two-stage gasifier to determine the kinetics of the tar cracking reaction. A new kinetic scheme is proposed for secondary tar cracking of biomass. The model is developed for downdraft biomass gasification and incorporates crucial effects of the pyrolysis fraction and char reactivity factor in its simulations. The model equations are solved using COMSOL Multiphysics. This model provides better agreement with experimental data than the model proposed by other researcher. This model is used to examine the influence of operating conditions in the gasifier, such as the length of the gasification zone, initial gas temperature, air flowrate, and mole fraction of oxygen in primary air, on product compositions (CO, CO2, H2, CH4, and tar). The result concludes that the increase in temperature leads to higher composition of carbon monoxide and lower composition of tar, and consequently higher low heating value (LHV). In addition, sensitivity analysis has been conducted to determine the influence of these parameters on product compositions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3abiomass 3acarbon dioxide 3acarbon monoxide 3acombustion 3acracking 3aequations 3agasification 3ahydrogen 3amethane 3amodels 3aoxygen 3apyrolysis 3areaction kinetics 3arice hulls 3atemperature 0aBiomass 0aPyrolysis 0aGasification 0aModeling 0aSimulation 0aTar cracking0 tEnergy.g2016 Dec. 01, v. 116 p.1065-1076dElsevier LtdwJournal:12436x0360-54427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2016.10.0373Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03804naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002100148245015400169300001600323520190000339592002802239596005802267596007802325596018702403650002002590650002302610650001602633650002102649650002102670650002102691650001502712650001302727650001702740650002702757650000902784650002702793650001402820650001102834700002302845700002602868700002202894700002402916700002102940700002202961700002302983700002103006700002003027773013603047856008203183852000903265655001203274IND60672037220221116144635.0191008e201911  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067203722DNAL7 a10.1007/s11240-019-01693-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSmýkalová, Iva14aThe effects of novel synthetic cytokinin derivatives and endogenous cytokinins on the in vitro growth responses of hemp (Cannabis sativa L.) explants  ap. 381-394.  aThe biotechnological utilization (genetic transformation, gene editing) of industrial hemp (Cannabis sativa L.) has been hampered by a lack of robust regeneration/in vitro multiplication protocols. In order to break this barrier we propose an approach combining standard application of exogenous growth regulators (auxins, cytokinins) with the knowledge of (1) endogenous cytokinin concentrations in primary explants based on latest analytical techniques and (2) the exogenous application of novel synthetic cytokinins or the regulators of their activity/function. We have tested eight explant types isolated from aseptically germinated seedlings in order to induce shoot regeneration/multiple shoot formation. The main problems appeared were callus formation and strong apical dominance. The latter phenomenon was suppressed using the auxin antagonist α-(2-oxo-2-phenylethyl)-1H-indole-3-acetic acid (PEO-IAA), and multiple shoot cultures were established from isolated apical meristems using media containing the novel synthetic cytokinin derivative 6-benzylamino-9-(tetrahydroxypyranyl)purin (BAP9THP). Endogenous cytokinin concentrations were measured in primary explants and explants cultured under diverse conditions to clarify the interactions between endogenous and exogenously applied cytokinins and their synthetic derivatives. These measurements were subsequently used to optimize the applied concentrations and timing of application of specific cytokinin derivatives to achieve desirable in vitro responses and regeneration including inhibition of callus formation, single shoot formation, and induction of multiple shoots. The well-developed shoots were rooted on media containing auxin (α-naphthaleneacetic acid). The protocol was developed using the variety USO-31 and has been successfully applied to four other industrial hemp varieties: Tygra, Monoica, Bialobrzeskie, Fibrol.  aPublisher supplied data  aTA04010331cTechnologická Agentura České Republiky  a51834/2017-MZE-17253/6.2.8cMinistry of Agriculture of the Czech Republic  aNo. LO1204cthe National Programme on Conservation and Utilization of Plant Genetic Resources and Agro-biodiversity Institutional support of Ministry of Agriculture of Czech Republic 3aCannabis sativa 3aanalytical methods 3aantagonists 3aapical dominance 3aapical meristems 3acallus formation 3acytokinins 3aexplants 3agene editing 3agenetic transformation 3ahemp 3anaphthaleneacetic acid 3aseedlings 3ashoots1 aVrbová, Miroslava1 aCvečková, Magdalena1 aPlačková, Lenka1 aŽukauskaitė, Asta1 aZatloukal, Marek1 aHrdlička, Jakub,1 aPlíhalová, Lucie1 aDoležal, Karel,1 aGriga, Miroslav0 tPlant cell, tissue, and organ culture.g2019 Nov., v. 139, no. 2 p.381-394dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl33513x0167-68577nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11240-019-01693-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02721naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002200152245013200174520131500306592002801621650003001649650001301679650001701692650002201709650000901731650001301740650002401753650002101777650001701798650001001815650001601825653002901841653003501870653002001905653002401925653002401949700001901973700001601992700001702008700001402025700001202039773011602051856008702167852000902254655001202263IND60778024320221120075245.0220531e20220715xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077802432DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enconman.2022.1157622doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Qiangqiang10aThermal performance analysis of an integrated solar reactor using solid oxide electrolysis cells (SOEC) for hydrogen production  aConcentrated solar power and solid oxide electrolysis cells (SOEC) can be combined to produce green hydrogen efficiently. However, heat loss due to fluid transport can be significant. In this paper, a volumetric receiver is first integrated with a tubular SOEC as a whole reactor to reduce the transport heat loss. Numerical investigation shows that the SOEC temperature, in a reference condition, ranges from 760 to 920 °C, which is qualified for regular operation. The efficiency analysis is conducted under different conditions and shows that the reactor efficiency is highly affected by the operating temperature. Therefore, increasing the incident power, decreasing the inlet velocity, or increasing the steam mass fraction would lead to a higher outlet temperature and thus a higher reactor efficiency. Based on the validated model, the integrated design presented in this paper can increase energy conversion efficiency by 2.63–30.21% compared with the separate structure, depending on the operation condition. The last section of this paper discusses the control strategy for the integrated reactor briefly, which aims to stabilize the reactor efficiency in outdoor situations. Compared with the steam mass fraction, the inlet velocity is preferred as a control variable to keep the cathode stable.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadministrative management 3acathodes 3aelectrolysis 3aenergy conversion 3aheat 3ahydrogen 3ahydrogen production 3amodel validation 3asolar energy 3asteam 3atemperature 0aIntegrated solar reactor 0aSolid oxide electrolysis cells 0aPorous absorber 0aHydrogen production 0aThermal performance1 aChang, Zheshao1 aFu, Mingkai1 aNie, Fuliang1 aRen, Ting1 aLi, Xin0 tEnergy conversion and management.g2022 July 15, v. 264 p.115762-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11831x0196-89047nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enconman.2022.1157623Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03081naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100001700141245015100158300001800309500001400327520152100341592002801862650001501890650001801905650002001923650001801943650001401961650001901975650004301994650001702037650001502054650002602069650002402095650002002119653001702139653002502156653002102181653002702202653001502229700002402244700002102268700002202289700002002311773018402331856007502515852000902590655001202599IND60691942720221118105121.0200502e20020101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069194272DNAL7 a10.1271/bbb.66.16282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTAI, Akihiro10aBioavailability of a Series of Novel Acylated Ascorbic Acid Derivatives, 6-O-Acyl-2-O-α-D-glucopyranosyl-L-ascorbic Acids, as an Ascorbic Acid…  ap. 1628-1634.  aNAL-light  aThe bioavailability of a series of novel acylated ascorbic acid derivatives, 6-O-acyl-2-O-α-D-glucopyranosyl-L-ascorbic acids (6-Acyl-AA-2G), as an ascorbic acid (AA) supplement was investigated in rats and guinea pigs. Oral administration of 6-Acyl-AA-2G to rats resulted in an increase in the plasma AA level. However, the intact form was not detectable in the plasma by high-performance liquid chromatography, indicating its hydrolysis through the process of absorption. After an intravenous injection to rats of 6-Octa-AA-2G as a representative derivative, the intact form rapidly disappeared from the plasma, being followed by a prolonged and marked elevation of the plasma AA level. Various tissue homogenates from guinea pigs were examined for their releasing activity of AA, 2-O-α-D-glucopyranosyl-L-ascorbic acid (AA-2G) and 6-O-acyl-AA from 6-Acyl-AA-2G. High activity was observed in the small intestine. These hydrolytic activities to AA and 6-O-acyl-AA were completely inhibited by castanospermine, an α-glucosidase inhibitor, and AA-2G was observed as the only resulting hydrolysate, suggesting the participation of α-glucosidase and esterase in the in vivo hydrolysis of 6-Acyl-AA-2G. 6-Octa-AA-2G was found to exhibit an obvious therapeutic effect in scorbutic guinea pigs from its repeated oral administration. These results indicate that 6-Acyl-AA-2G is a readily available source of AA activity in vivo, and may be useful as an effective pharmacological agent and as a promising food additive.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3aascorbic acid 3abioavailability 3abiotechnology 3aesterases 3afood additives 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3ahydrolysates 3ahydrolysis 3aintravenous injection 3aoral administration 3asmall intestine 0a6-Acyl-AA-2G 0alipophilic ascorbate 0astable ascorbate 0aantiscorbutic activity 0ametabolism1 aFUJINAMI, Yoshihito1 aMATSUMOTO, Kyoko1 aKAWASAKI, Daisuke1 aYAMAMOTO, Itaru0 tBioscience, biotechnology, and biochemistry.g2002 Jan. 1, v. 66, no. 8 p.1628-1634dJapan Society for Bioscience, Biotechnology, and AgrochemistrywJournal:18959x1347-69477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1271/bbb.66.16283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04269naa a2200733 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004600094024004300140024005000183040001800233100001900251245011400270300001400384506002800398506003600426506007600462506003100538520170100569592002802270596010302298596008702401596004502488596007302533506003702606650002502643650001502668650001602683650002002699650001802719650001602737650003002753650001602783650001502799650003502814650001302849650001202862650001802874650001002892650002302902653001702925653003502942653002402977653002003001653003403021653002103055700001403076700001903090700001703109700001303126700002103139700001903160700002103179700002203200700002803222700002403250700001603274773011003290856009003400903002403490852000903514655001203523IND60561888520221207094501.0190405e201703  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056188852DNAL7 a10.1016/j.anireprosci.2017.01.0072chorus7 a10.1016/j.anireprosci.2017.01.0072doi7 a10.1016/j.anireprosci.2017.01.0072chorusOpen  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSecher, Jan O.10aEvaluation of porcine stem cell competence for somatic cell nuclear transfer and production of cloned animals  ap. 40-49.  aResource is Open Access  aElsevier BV License Information  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aCHORUS License Information  aPorcine somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT) has been used extensively to create genetically modified pigs, but the efficiency of the methodology is still low. It has been hypothesized that pluripotent or multipotent stem cells might result in increased SCNT efficacy as these cells are closer than somatic cells to the epigenetic state found in the blastomeres and therefore need less reprogramming. Our group has worked with porcine SCNT during the last 20 years and here we describe our experience with SCNT of 3 different stem cell lines. The porcine stem cells used were: Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) created by lentiviral doxycycline-dependent reprogramming and cultered with a GSK3β- and MEK-inhibitor (2i) and leukemia inhibitor factor (LIF) (2i LIF DOX-iPSCs), iPSCs created by a plasmid-based reprogramming and cultured with 2i and fibroblast growth factor (FGF) (2i FGF Pl-iPSCs) and embryonic germ cells (EGCs), which have earlier been characterized as being multipotent. The SCNT efficiencies of these stem cell lines were compared with that of the two fibroblast cell lines from which the iPSC lines were derived. The blastocyst rates for the 2i LIF DOX-iPSCs were 14.7%, for the 2i FGF Pl-iPSC 10.1%, and for the EGCs 34.5% compared with the fibroblast lines yielding 36.7% and 25.2%. The fibroblast- and EGC-derived embryos were used for embryo transfer and produced live offspring at similar low rates of efficiency (3.2 and 4.0%, respectively) and with several instances of malformations. In conclusion, potentially pluripotent porcine stem cells resulted in lower rates of embryonic development upon SCNT than multipotent stem cells and differentiated somatic cells.  aPublisher supplied data  cDanish Council for Independent Research Natural Sciences (FNU)dhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100008394  cDanish National Advanced Technology Foundationdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100008617  cUSDAdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100000199  cVillum Kann Rasmussen Foundationdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/1000072760 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aabnormal development 3ablastocyst 3ablastomeres 3aembryo transfer 3aembryogenesis 3aepigenetics 3afibroblast growth factors 3afibroblasts 3agerm cells 3ainduced pluripotent stem cells 3aleukemia 3aprogeny 3asomatic cells 3aswine 3atransgenic animals 0aPluripotency 0aInduced pluripotent stem cells 0aEmbryonic germ cell 0aTransgenic pigs 0aSomatic cell nuclear transfer 0aHandmade cloning1 aLiu, Ying1 aPetkov, Stoyan1 aLuo, Yonglun1 aLi, Dong1 aHall, Vanessa J.1 aSchmidt, Mette1 aCallesen, Henrik1 aBentzon, Jacob F.1 aSørensen, Charlotte B.1 aFreude, Kristine K.1 aHyttel, P.,0 tAnimal reproduction science.g2017 Mar., v. 178 p.40-49dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl11636x0378-43207nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.anireprosci.2017.01.0073Available from publisher's site  aAccepted Manuscript  aDNAL 7aarticle02842naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002400151245012400175520146800299592002801767650000901795650001801804650001701822650001201839650001901851650002501870650002301895650001901918650001801937650001301955650002601968650001101994650002702005653001902032653002302051653002302074653002302097653002102120700002802141700002902169773010302198856008602301852000902387655001202396IND60732809920221120200419.0211003e202109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073280992DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodhyd.2021.1067902doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEngel, Juliana Both10aHow are the properties of biocomposite foams influenced by the substitution of cassava starch for its residual sources?  aTwo residues from the cassava processing industry, cassava inner bark and gelatinized starch, were applied as substitutes for native cassava starch in the development of foams using a thermocompression process (180 °C, 6 min, 7 MPa). The starchy pastes were also submitted to a pre-gelatinization step in a water bath (80 °C, 2 min) to evaluate the effect of this step on the properties of the foams. The thickness measurements seemed to be more influenced by the starch amount in the formulations, while the bulk density and the water absorption capacity (WAC) were more influenced by the starch source and its chemical composition. In general, the pre-gelatinization seemed to have affected more directly the properties of the biocomposites fabricated solely with cassava starch. Moreover, these pre-gelatinized biocomposites presented greater mechanical resistance and higher elongation values. Biocomposites with the incorporation of cassava inner bark presented lower WAC (84% after 90 min), demonstrating their high potential for application as a quick-use packaging for low-moisture foods. These results showed that the non-necessity of the pre-gelatinization step could lead to an increase in biocomposites’ fabrication speed due to the elimination of the water bath heating stage, minimizing production costs. Besides that, it is important to highlight the cost reduction related to the use of cassava residues instead of native cassava starch.  aPublisher supplied data 3abark 3abiocomposites 3abulk density 3acassava 3acassava starch 3achemical composition 3acost effectiveness 3agelatinization 3ahydrocolloids 3aindustry 3amechanical properties 3astarch 3awater binding capacity 0aCassava starch 0aCassava inner bark 0aGelatinized starch 0aPre-gelatinization 0aThemocompression1 aLuchese, Claudia Leites1 aTessaro, Isabel Cristina0 tFood hydrocolloids.g2021 Sept., v. 118 p.106790-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46643x0268-005X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodhyd.2021.1067903Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02641naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001300151245011400164500001900278520129400297592002801591650001601619650001001635650001401645650001201659650001301671650002001684650001401704650001101718650000901729650001501738653002001753653001501773653001701788700001401805700001801819700001501837700001901852700001901871700001801890700001801908700001301926700001601939773010901955856008602064852000902150655001202159IND60725972220221116152524.0210212e20210405xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072597222DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scienta.2021.1099292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXia, Hui10aBiochemical and molecular factors governing flesh-color development in two yellow-fleshed kiwifruit cultivars  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aTo identify the biochemical and molecular factors causing flesh-color variation between two yellow-flesh kiwifruit cultivars 'Jinshi 1′ and 'Jinyan', the composition of carotenoids and chlorophyll, and associated gene expression profile in their pulp were investigated during fruit development. At harvest, ‘Jinshi 1′ exhibited brighter yellow flesh than ‘Hort16A’ with a lower color hue angle, although they had a similar total carotenoid content. At the molecular level, ‘Jinshi 1′ exhibited higher expression level of chlorophyll catabolic genes (CBR, PPH, and PAO), leading to lower accumulation of chlorophyll in the flesh. Meanwhile, higher expression levels of NCED1 resulted in greater carotenoid degradation in ‘Hort16A’. In addition, ‘Hort16A’ had a higher content of lutein, zeaxanthin and β-carotene, whereas ‘Jinshi 1′ had specific β-cryptoxanthin on ripening, accordingly, the expression of CHYB1, which encodes the enzyme for the formation of zeaxanthin and β-cryptoxanthin, was higher during the last developmental stage in ‘Jinshi 1′ than in ‘Hort16A’. These results suggested that the higher carotenoid/chlorophyll ratio, as well as the higher β-cryptoxanthin proportion are the important reasons for the brighter yellow flesh color.  aPublisher supplied data 3achlorophyll 3acolor 3acultivars 3aenzymes 3afruiting 3agene expression 3akiwifruit 3alutein 3apulp 3azeaxanthin 0aColor diversity 0aCarotenoid 0aYellow flesh1 aWang, Xiu1 aZhou, Yuanjie1 aSu, Wenyue1 aJiang, Liujing1 aDeng, Honghong1 aLi, Mingzhang1 aZhuang, Qiguo1 aXie, Yue1 aLiang, Dong0 tScientia horticulturae.g2021 Apr. 05, v. 280 p.109929-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4108x0304-42387nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scienta.2021.1099293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02393naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001900152245008300171520093900254592002801193650003001221650000801251650001201259650001201271650002101283650001501304650002201319650003101341650002201372650001601394650001501410650001901425650001501444650001101459650001101470653002901481653001801510653003001528653003201558700001801590700001801608700002301626700002101649700001701670773011601687856008701803852000901890655001201899IND60778024520221120100027.0220830e20220801xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077802452DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enconman.2022.1157652doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiang, Jyun-De10aPerformance investigation of a hybrid ground-assisted desiccant cooling system  aThis study proposes a novel hybrid ground-assisted desiccant cooling (HGDC) system that integrates a heat pump and shallow geothermal energy.

The analytes were subsequently analyzed with high performance liquid chromatography and diode array detection (HPLC–DAD). Preliminary experiments were carried out in order to study experimental conditions for pesticides’ extraction from spiked hair and water samples with HF-SPME using hollow fiber-supported ionic liquid mediated sol–gel sorbent. The sol–gel nanocomposites were reinforced with nanoparticles such as carboxylic functionalized multi-walled carbon nanotubes (COOH-MWCNTs), amino functionalized multi-walled carbon nanotubes (NH₂-MWCNTs), nano SiO₂, nano TiO₂ and nano MgO comparatively to promote extraction efficiency. In this device, the innovative solid sorbents were developed by the sol–gel method via the reaction of tetraethylorthosilicate (TEOS) with 2-amino-2-hydroxymethyl-propane-1,3-diol (TRIS). In the basic condition (pH 10–11), the gel growth process in the presence of ionic liquid and nanoparticles was initiated. Then, the sol was injected into a polypropylene hollow fiber segment for in situ gelation process. Parameters affecting the efficiency of HF-SPME were thoroughly investigated. Linearity was observed over a range of 0.01–25,000ng/mL with detection limits between 0.004 and 0.095ng/mL for the pesticides in the aqueous matrices and 0.003–0.080ng/mL in the hair matrices. The relative recoveries in the real samples ranged from 82.0% to 94.0% for the pesticides store seller's hair and the work researchers’ hair. Results are showing the great possibilities of HF-SPME–HPLC-PDA for analysis of pesticides in biological and environmental samples.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorbents 3acarbon nanotubes 3adetection limit 3adiazinon 3afenitrothion 3afenvalerate 3agelation 3agels 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3ahumans 3aionic liquids 3amagnesium oxide 3amalathion 3ananocomposites 3ananoparticles 3apH 3apesticide residues 3aphosalone 3apolypropylenes 3aresearchers 3asilica 3asol-gel processing 3asolid phase microextraction 3atitanium dioxide 3atridemorph1 aEs‘haghi, Zarrin1 aSamadi, Fatemeh1 aHosseini, Mohammad-Saeid0 tJournal of chromatography.g2011 Nov. 18, v. 1218, no. 46 p.8313-8321dElsevier B.V.x0021-96737nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chroma.2011.09.0583Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03359naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245014600169300001800315500001900333520162300352536033501975592002802310596001302338596001602351596001602367650001002383650001702393650001502410650001702425650001102442650001002453650002002463650001102483650001602494650002502510650001502535651001002550651001502560700001502575700001902590700001702609700001802626773013902644856008502783852000902868655001202877IND60736612020221118132042.0210510e20210618xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073661202DNAL7 a10.1080/01431161.2021.18971862doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCao, Mengmeng12aA spectral index for the detection of algal blooms using Sentinel-2 Multispectral Instrument (MSI) imagery: a case study of Hulun Lake, China  ap. 4510-4531.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aLakes at a global level have increasingly experienced algal blooms in recent decades, and it has become a key challenge facing the aquatic ecological environment. Remote sensing technology is considered an effective means of algal bloom detection. This study proposed a novel algal bloom detection index (ABDI) based on Sentinel-2 Multispectral Instrument (MSI) data. The ABDI was evaluated by application to Hulun Lake, China. Areas of algal bloom detected by the ABDI were consistent with those identified from visual interpretation maps [the coefficient of determination = 0.87; root-mean-square error = 0.67 km²; overall accuracy >98%; Kappa coefficient >0.88]. The ABDI was less sensitive to thin cloud and turbid water compared to the floating algae index (FAI), adjusted floating algae index (AFAI), normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), and enhanced vegetation index (EVI). Algal bloom dynamics in relation to meteorological factors in Hulun Lake were analysed using time-series MSI data, which indicated that algal blooms occurred mainly in summer and were distributed in the near-shore waters. Temperature, precipitation, sunshine duration, and wind speed as well as human activities were found to influence spatio-temporal patterns of algal blooms. The results indicate that ABDI is applicable to the detection of algal blooms under a variety of environmental conditions occurring in other regions, such as in the Taihu, Dianchi, and Chaohu lakes and the Yellow Sea. The results of this study can provide an operational algorithm for the detection of algal blooms and environmental management.  aThis work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant 41961057; the Program for Young Talents of Science and Technology in the Universities of Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region under Grant NJYT-17-B04; and the Natural Science Foundation of Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region under Grant 2019MS04013.  aPublisher supplied data  a41961057  aNJYT-17-B04  a2019MS04013 3aalgae 3aalgal blooms 3aalgorithms 3acase studies 3ahumans 3alakes 3asolar radiation 3asummer 3atemperature 3atime series analysis 3awind speed 3aChina 3aYellow Sea1 aQing, Song1 aJin, Eerdemutu1 aHao, Yanling1 aZhao, Wenjing0 tInternational journal of remote sensing.g2021 June 18, v. 42, no. 12 p.4510-4531dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl45620x1366-59017nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01431161.2021.18971863Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01834naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002600150245011900176300001800295520075600313592002801069650001201097650001801109650002301127650001901150650002401169650001801193650001201211700002401223700002601247700002401273773010601297856008401403852000901487655001201496IND60112900920221122180753.0141111e20111118xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011290092DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chroma.2011.09.0242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAguilar, Patrícia P.10aKinetics of Angiotensin I alteration of conformation on different hydrophobic interaction chromatographic surfaces  ap. 8322-8332.  aIn the present study, Angiotensin I (Ang I) will be used as model peptide to assess on-column alteration of conformation phenomena. Adsorptive behavior of Ang I on various commercial hydrophobic interaction surfaces (Butyl, Octyl and Phenyl – Sepharose), under different conditions, was investigated. In order to calculate the cis–trans isomerization rate constants of Ang I on the stationary phase's surface, the first and second moments of the proline peptide elution profiles were determined. The activation energies for the isomerization process on Phenyl and Butyl Sepharose were also calculated. Results suggest that the stationary phase catalyzes Ang I isomerization and that catalysis is dependent on hydrophobic interaction ligand nature.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagarose 3aangiotensin I 3acatalytic activity 3achromatography 3ahydrophobic bonding 3aisomerization 3aproline1 aNunes, Catherine A.1 aCascalheira, José F.1 aDias-Cabral, Ana C.0 tJournal of chromatography.g2011 Nov. 18, v. 1218, no. 46 p.8322-8332dElsevier B.V.x0021-96737nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chroma.2011.09.0243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02616naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100002000141245016200161300001800323500001900341520110100360592002801461650001701489650002101506650001301527650001801540650001801558650002301576650001801599650001901617650002001636650002301656650001901679650002101698650000901719650002201728653001701750653002801767653002401795700002101819700001701840700002101857773018401878856007502062852000902137655001202146IND60691943020221118105316.0200502e20020101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069194302DNAL7 a10.1271/bbb.66.16462doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSAKAI, Tsuyoshi10aIsolation from Nocardioides sp.

The bacterium was classified as a Nocardioides sp. The enzyme was purified to a homogeneous protein by treatment at 100°C, ammonium sulfate precipitation, and chromatography on DEAE-Toyopearl, hydroxyapatite, and then Sephacryl S-100. Twenty micrograms of the pure enzyme was obtained from 811 mg of the starting crude protein. After treatment at 50°C for 15 min in the absence of dithiothreitol, enzyme activity was 44% of the starting activity; after treatment at 100°C for 2 h in the presence of 50 mM dithiothreitol, activity was 56% of the starting activity. Dithiothreitol greatly stabilized the enzyme. Activity was maximum at 99°C. The Kₘ values for deoxycytidine, cytidine, and methyl-deoxycytidine were 55.2, 140, and 130 μM, respectively. The molecular mass was estimated to be 52 kDa by gel permeation chromatography. The enzyme molecule was dissociated into two subunits each of 18 kDa subunit when reduced with mercaptoethanol.  aPublisher supplied data 3aNocardioides 3aammonium sulfate 3abacteria 3abiotechnology 3acrude protein 3acytidine deaminase 3adeoxycytidine 3adithiothreitol 3aenzyme activity 3agel chromatography 3ahydroxyapatite 3amolecular weight 3asoil 3athermal stability 0athermostable 0adeoxycytidine deaminase 0amesophilic bacteria1 aDAIKAI, Takahiro1 aMONMA, Hideo1 aMAEDA, Hidekatsu0 tBioscience, biotechnology, and biochemistry.g2002 Jan. 1, v. 66, no. 8 p.1646-1651dJapan Society for Bioscience, Biotechnology, and AgrochemistrywJournal:18959x1347-69477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1271/bbb.66.16463Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03579naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001700094024002300111024002800134024002300162024004000185024002500225040001800250100005200268245004900320300001600369500002000385520158100405592002801986650003402014650001402048650002702062650002502089650001402114650001202128650001202140650001402152650001002166650001602176650000902192650001902201650001202220650001402232651001202246700005802258700005602316700005302372700005602425700001302481700001702494700001702511700001802528700005902546700001602605773012502621856011402746856007502860961002102935852000902956655001202965IND60770944720221214223757.0220820e202105  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077094472DNAL7 a3781392aris7 a10113/77094472hdl7 a10.1002/plr2.201232doi7 a3781392seq_no_1157 a6030-21000-006-00D2aris_project_no7 a4343682aris_accn_no  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhao, D.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3175-796810aRegistration of ‘CP 11‐1640’ sugarcane  ap. 326-336.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  a‘CP 11‐1640’ (Reg. no. CV‐199, PI 695085) sugarcane (a complex hybrid of Saccharum spp.) was developed through cooperative research conducted by the USDA–ARS, the University of Florida, and the Florida Sugar Cane League, Inc., and released by the Florida Sugarcane Variety Committee (FSVC) to growers for commercial cultivation on mineral (sand) soils in Florida in June 2019. It was selected from a polycross made at Canal Point on 2 Jan. 2009 with Canal Point sugarcane breeding line CP 01‐2390 (female parent). Its male parent was unknown and could be any one of the clones used in the polycross. CP 11‐1640 was released by FSVC because of its high cane and sucrose yields, acceptable commercial recoverable sucrose, and resistance to brown rust, orange rust, leaf scald, Sugarcane mosaic virus strain E (mosaic), and smut. Based on the results of 12 harvests with three crops (plant cane, first ratoon, and second ratoon) at four locations in final‐stage replicated yield trials on sand soils and compared with reference cultivars (CL 88‐4730, CP 96‐1252, CPCL 97‐2730), CP 11‐1640 had significantly higher cane yield (13.4–16.9%), sucrose yield (12.0–12.8%), and economic index (10.9–16.9%) than CL 88‐4730 and CPCL 97‐2730 and did not differ from CP 96‐1252 in any of these traits. Cane fiber content of CP 11‐1640 (138.9 kg Mg⁻¹) was equivalent to that of CL 88‐4730 but slightly higher than that of CP 96‐1252 and CPCL 97‐2730. CP 11‐1640 was considered to be moderately tolerant to freezing among 18 genotypes tested.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAgricultural Research Service 3aSaccharum 3aSugarcane mosaic virus 3acooperative research 3acultivars 3afemales 3ahybrids 3aleaf rust 3amales 3aorange rust 3asand 3ascald diseases 3asucrose 3asugarcane 3aFlorida1 aDavidson, R.W.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2860-34231 aGordon, V.S.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6490-69851 aIslam, Md1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4965-53881 aSandhu, H.S.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1012-85561 aSood, S.1 aBaltazar, M.1 aMcCord, P.H.1 aMigneault, A.1 aCoto Arbelo, O.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5885-08151 aMomotaz, A.0 tJournal of plant registrations.g2021 May, v. 15, no. 2 p.326-336dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:6195x1936-52097nnas40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/77094473Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/plr2.201233Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/NALUSDA/ARS  aDNAL 7aarticle03018naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245015400169300001400323520142000337592002801757650002101785650001101806650002001817650001401837650000901851650001201860650001801872650002701890650001701917650001101934650001001945650001801955650001501973650001301988650001002001650002202011650001802033650002002051650001302071653002102084653001802105653002402123653002202147700001402169700001802183700001802201700001302219700001902232773011902251856008502370852000902455655001202464IND60540464120221118000650.0190318e201503  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054046412DNAL7 a10.1016/j.pestbp.2015.02.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCao, ChuanWang10aCharacterization of the transcriptome of the Asian gypsy moth Lymantria dispar identifies numerous transcripts associated with insecticide resistance  ap. 54-61.  aAlthough the Asian gypsy moth Lymantria dispar causes extensive forest damage worldwide, little is known regarding the genes involved in its development or response to insecticides. Accordingly, characterization of the transcriptome of L. dispar larvae would promote the development of toxicological methods for its control. RNA-seq analysis of L. dispar larvae messenger RNA (mRNA) generated 62,063 unigenes with N50 of 993 bp, from which 23,975 unique sequences (E-value < 10−5) were identified using a BLASTx search of the NCBI non-redundant (nr) database. Using functional classification in the Gene Ontology (GO) and Clusters of Orthologous Groups (COG) databases, 7,309 indentified sequences were categorized into 51 functional groups and 8,079 sequences were categorized into 25 functional groups, respectively. Moreover, we identified a large number of transcripts encoding known insecticide targets, or proteins involved in the metabolism of insecticides. Reads per kilobase of unigene length per million mapped reads (RPKM) analysis identified 39 high abundance transcripts, of which 27 exhibited significantly altered expression patterns across the egg, larvae, pupae, male and female adult stages. Our study provides the most comprehensive transcriptomic sequence resource for L. dispar, which will form the basis for future identification of candidate insecticide resistance genes in L. dispar.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLymantria dispar 3aadults 3acontrol methods 3adatabases 3aeggs 3afemales 3aforest damage 3ainsecticide resistance 3ainsecticides 3alarvae 3amales 3amessenger RNA 3ametabolism 3aproteins 3apupae 3asequence analysis 3atranscriptome 3atranscriptomics 3aunigenes 0aAsian gypsy moth 0aTranscriptome 0aInsecticide targets 0aSolexa sequencing1 aSun, LiLi1 aWen, RongRong1 aShang, QingLi1 aMa, Ling1 aWang, Zhiying,0 tPesticide biochemistry and physiology.g2015 Mar., v. 119 p.54-61dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl1414x0048-35757nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.pestbp.2015.02.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03494naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245011300170300001800283520201100301592002802312650001402340650001702354650003102371650001302402650001102415650001102426650002102437650001802458650002402476650003302500650001102533650001802544650001502562700002802577700005802605700006202663700006602725700005602791773012002847856008402967852000903051655001203060IND60675971720221119024505.0191112e20191022xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067597172DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.macromol.9b010722doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAmann, Matthias10aKinetic Pathways for Polyelectrolyte Coacervate Micelle Formation Revealed by Time-Resolved Synchrotron SAXS  ap. 8227-8237.  aThe kinetic pathways for coacervation and micelle formation are still not fully understood. Driven by electrostatic interactions and entropically driven counterion release, complexation of oppositely charged macromolecules leads to the formation of micellar nanostructures. Here we study the coacervation process, from initial formation and growth of stable micelles, on a nanometric length scale using time-resolved small-angle X-ray scattering (TR-SAXS). The micellar coacervates are formed through the complexation of anionic polyelectrolyte poly(sodium 4-styrenesulfonate) (PSSS) and cationic block–copolymer poly(ethylene oxide)-block-poly((vinylbenzyl)trimethylammonium chloride) (PEO-b-PVBTA). Mixing the polyelectrolytes in a stoichiometric 1:1 charge ratio resulted in the formation of stable spherical core–shell micellar-like coacervates consisting of a central core of complexed PSSS and PVBTA with a PEO corona. By use of synchrotron SAXS coupled to a stopped-flow mixing apparatus, the whole formation kinetics of coacervates could be followed in situ from a few milliseconds. The results of a detailed data modeling reveal that the formation of these polyelectrolyte coacervates follows a two-step process: (i) first, metastable large-scale aggregates are formed upon a barrier-free complexation immediately after mixing; (ii) subsequently, the clusters undergo charge equilibration upon chain rearrangement and exchange processes yielding micellar-like aggregates with net neutral charge that are pinched off to yield the final stable micelle-like coacervates. While the initial cluster formation is very fast and completed within the dead time of mixing, the subsequent rearrangement becomes significantly slower with increasing molecular weight of the PVBTA block. Interestingly, the overall kinetic process was essentially concentration independent, indicating that the rearrangement process is mainly accomplished via noncooperative chain rearrangement and chain exchange processes.  aPublisher supplied data 3achlorides 3aelectrolytes 3aelectrostatic interactions 3amicelles 3amixing 3amodels 3amolecular weight 3ananomaterials 3apolyethylene glycol 3asmall-angle X-ray scattering 3asodium 3astoichiometry 3asulfonates1 aDiget, Jakob Stensgaard1 aLyngsø, Jeppe1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6301-13001 aPedersen, Jan Skov1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7768-02061 aNarayanan, Theyencheri1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1957-10411 aLund, Reidar1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8017-63960 tMacromolecules.g2019 Oct. 22, v. 52, no. 21 p.8227-8237dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23616x1520-58357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.macromol.9b010723Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02095naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002200150245009100172300001600263520080900279592002801088650001701116650001201133650001301145650001601158650001901174650000701193650004101200650001101241650002301252653002601275653001701301653002301318653002601341653003401367700002101401700002101422700002301443773011401466856008401580852000901664655001201673IND60602339620221118220459.0180711e20151030xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060233962DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chroma.2015.09.0222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSmirnova, Adelina10aReversed-phase chromatography in extended-nano space for the separation of amino acids  ap. 224-227.  aIn this work we used reversed-phase chromatography in extended-nano channels to separate amino acids.

The experimental field was dominated mainly by grassy weed P. minor Retz. The major weeds among broad-leaved weeds (BLW) were Coronopus didymus L., Anagallis arvensis L., Melilotus indica All. Fl. Ped., Medicago denticulata L., Rumex dentatus L., Vicia sativa L. and Lathyrus aphaca L. Intra-group combinations of herbicides viz., ACCase inhibitor (clodinafop/fenoxaprop/pinoxaden) with ACCase inhibitor and ALS inhibitor (sulfosulfuron/mesosulfuron+iodosulfuron) with ALS inhibitor were compatible and resulted in very effective control of P. minor and consequently yields of wheat (5552–5861 kg/ha in 2006–07 and 5510–5897 kg/ha in 2007–08) were comparable to weed free checks (5909 kg/ha in 2006–07 and 5850 kg/ha in 2007–08). While inter-group combinations (clodinafop/fenoxaprop/pinoxaden with sulfosulfuron/mesosulfuron+iodosulfuron) were not found compatible and resulted in lower control of P. minor with lower yields (5054–5239 kg/ha in 200607 and 4285–4976 kg/ha in 2007–08). Alone application and all combinations having sulfosulfuron or mesosulfuron + iodosulfuron provided good control of BLW even under inter-group combinations. There was no phyto-toxicity of any of the herbicidal treatments on wheat, except some recoverable symptoms under treatments having mesosulfuron+iodosulfuron during 2007–08.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAnagallis arvensis 3aLathyrus 3aMedicago 3aMelilotus indicus 3aPhalaris minor 3aRumex dentatus 3aVicia sativa 3aagricultural colleges 3afenoxaprop 3afield experimentation 3agrass weeds 3aphytotoxicity 3awheat 3aIndia 0aHerbicides 0aTank-mix combinations 0aWeed control1 aPunia, S.

Adolescence is a critical period for neural system development characterized by continuous brain maturation, especially in the prefrontal cortex. The etiology of these adolescent conditions may derive from fetal origin, probably attributed to the adverse effects induced by intrauterine environmental exposure. Anxiety- and depression-like behavior can be induced by gestational exposure to PM₂.₅ in mice offspring which act as a useful model system. Recent studies show that B-vitamin may alleviate PM₂.₅-induced hippocampal neuroinflammation- and function-related spatial memory impairment in adolescent mice offspring. However, cortical damage and related neurobehavioral defects induced by gestational PM₂.₅ exposure, as well as the potential reversibility by interventions in mice offspring require to be elucidated. Here, we aimed to investigate whether B-vitamin would protect mice offspring from the adverse effects derived from gestational exposure to urban PM₂.₅ on cortical areas to which anxiety and depression are closely related. Pregnant mice were divided into three groups: control group (treated with PBS alone), model group (treated with both PM₂.₅ and PBS), and intervention group (treated with both PM₂.₅ and B-vitamin), respectively. The mice offspring were then applied to comprehensive neurobehavioral, ultrastructural, biochemical, and molecular biological analyses. Interestingly, we observed that gestational PM₂.₅ exposure led to neurobehavioral defects including anxiety- and depression-like behavior. In addition, neuroinflammation, oxidative damage, increased apoptosis, and caspase-1-mediated inflammasome activation in the prefrontal cortex were observed. Notably, both behavioral and molecular changes could be significantly alleviated by B-vitamin treatment. In summary, our results suggest that the anxiety- and depression-like behavior induced by gestational PM₂.₅ exposure in mice offspring can be ameliorated by B-vitamin supplementation, probably through the suppression of apoptosis, oxidative damage, neuroinflammation, and caspase-1-mediated inflammasome activation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadolescence 3aadolescents 3aanxiety 3aapoptosis 3aetiology 3ainflammasomes 3amaternal exposure 3amemory disorders 3apollution 3aprefrontal cortex 3aprogeny 3aspatial memory 0aPM2.5 0aB-Vitamin 0aNeuroinflammation 0aDepression-like behavior 0aB-Vitamin ameliorates anxiety- and depression-like behavior induced by gestational PM2.5 exposure through suppressing neuroinflammation in the prefrontal cortex 0aCNS 0aNLRP3 0aPFC 0aTUNEL 0aMDA 0aSOD 0aGSH 0aGSH-Px 0aPM2.5 0aEdU 0aROS 0aPSD1 aWang, Tingting1 aSun, Lijuan1 aZhang, Haoyun1 aLiu, Chong1 aZhang, Can1 aYu, Li0 tEnvironmental pollution.g2020 Nov., v. 266 p.115146-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl41014x0269-74917nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2020.1151463Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03230naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001500150245017100165500001900336520172300355592002802078650002602106650001902132650002402151650001402175650002602189650001202215650001402227650001602241650001602257650001402273650001402287650000902301653002402310653002902334653002302363653002402386653002502410700001602435700001402451700001702465700001802482700001902500700001602519773010702535856008502642852000902727655001202736IND60701556320221123004241.0210114e202012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070155632DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envpol.2020.1151552doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Kun10aBacterial community composition and function succession under aerobic and anaerobic conditions impacts the biodegradation of 17β-estradiol and its environmental risk  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe widespread detection of 17β-estradiol (E2) in the environment has become an emerging concern worldwide due to its endocrine disrupting effects. This work focuses on the aerobic and anaerobic biodegradations of E2 in various sedimentary environments with different availabilities of electron acceptors, including O₂, NO₃⁻, Fe³⁺, SO₄²⁻, or HCO₃⁻. The highest removal efficiency (98.9%) and shortest degradation half-life of E2 (t₁/₂ = 5.0 d) were achieved under aerobic condition, followed by nitrate-reducing, ferric-reducing, sulfate-reducing and methanogenic conditions. We propose four different degradation pathways of E2 based on the metabolites identified under various redox conditions. Although most of E2 was effectively removed under aerobic condition, the potential environmental risk still needs to be considered due to the residual estrogenic activity induced by estrone (E1) formation. The endocrine-disrupting activities, as indicated by estradiol equivalent (EEQ) values, were related to E2 degradation rate and metabolite formation. We further analyzed the succession of bacterial community compositions and functions using Illumina HiSeq sequencing and Phylogenetic Investigation of Communities by Reconstruction of Unobserved States (PICRUSt). The findings herein evidenced that bacterial community compositions and metabolic functions associated with different redox conditions impact the biodegradation of E2 and its endocrine-disrupting activity. This knowledge will be useful in predicting the environmental fates of estrogenic hormones in various sedimentary environments and aid in establishing appropriate strategies for eliminating potential environmental risks.  aPublisher supplied data 3abacterial communities 3abiodegradation 3acommunity structure 3aestradiol 3aestrogenic properties 3aestrone 3ahalf life 3ametabolites 3amethanogens 3aphylogeny 3apollution 3arisk 0a17β-estradiol (E2) 0aBiodegradation mechanism 0aEnvironmental fate 0aMicrobial community 0aMetabolite formation1 aZhang, Zhen1 aHu, Zheng1 aZeng, Feifan1 aChen, Chengyu1 aYang, Xingjian1 aLi, Yongtao0 tEnvironmental pollution.g2020 Dec., v. 267 p.115155-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl41014x0269-74917nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2020.1151553Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01453naa a2200253 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002100143245006900164300001600233520062400249592002800873650001000901650001400911650002200925700001700947773013700964856007701101852000901178655001201187IND60521519020221123023333.0160530e20140602xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052151902DNAL7 a10.1515/znb-1977-02102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChristmas, B.

The highest CAT and SOD activity was found prior to radicle protrusion, while POD activity was maximal at the time of radicle protrusion and seedling development, new POD isozymes simultaneously appearing. The concentrations of total, reduced and oxidized glutathione showed similar changes during germination, the highest values being detected at the time of radicle protrusion. Ascorbic acid was present in the seeds in a detectable concentration only at the time preceding radicle protrusion, while its oxidized form dehydroascorbic acid was detected during the whole germination period studied. Gibberellic acid (GA₃, 160 μM) had no effect on germination percentage, but in presence of GA₃, SOD and CAT activity notably increased prior to radicle protrusion, and oxidized glutathione concentration decreased in further germination.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChenopodium rubrum 3aantioxidant activity 3aascorbic acid 3acatalase 3adehydroascorbic acid 3agermination 3agibberellic acid 3aglutathione 3aisozymes 3aperoxidase 3aseedlings 3aseeds 3asuperoxide dismutase1 aLirić-rajlić, I.1 aMitrović, A.1 aRadotić, K.0 tBiologia plantarum.g2003 Dec., v. 47, no. 4 p.527-533dKluwer Academic Publishersx0006-31347nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1023/B:BIOP.0000041057.11390.583Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03121naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002400140245015500164520179700319592002802116650001502144650001902159650002402178650002602202650001102228650005002239650002302289650001902312650001502331650001202346650001102358650001202369650001102381651001802392700001702410700001902427700002002446700002102466773012802487856007502615852000902690655001202699IND60704002320221118012354.0200722e20200517xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070400232DNAL7 a10.3390/rs121015942doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPrigent, Catherine 10aIce Concentration Retrieval from the Analysis of Microwaves: Evaluation of a New Methodology Optimized for the Copernicus Imaging Microwave Radiometer  aA new methodology has been described in Kilic et al. (Ice Concentration Retrieval from the Analysis of Microwaves: A New Methodology Designed for the Copernicus Imaging Microwave Radiometer, Remote Sensing 2020, 12, 1060, Part 1 of this study) to estimate Sea Ice Concentration (SIC) from satellite passive microwave observations between 6 and 36 GHz. The Ice Concentration Retrieval from the Analysis of Microwaves (IceCREAM) algorithm is based on an optimal estimation, with a simple radiative transfer model derived from satellite observations at 0% and 100% SIC. Observations at low and high frequencies have different spatial resolutions, and a scheme is developed to benefit from the low errors of the low frequencies and the high spatial resolutions of the high frequencies. This effort is specifically designed for the Copernicus Imaging Microwave Radiometer (CIMR) project, equipped with a large deployable antenna to provide a spatial resolution of ∼5 km at 18 and 36 GHz, and ∼15 km at 6 and 10 GHz. The algorithm is tested with Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer 2 (AMSR2) observations, for a clear scene over the north polar region, with collocated Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) estimates and the Ocean Sea Ice—Satellite Application Facilities (OSI SAF) operational products. Several algorithm options are tested, and the study case shows that both high spatial resolution and low errors are obtained with the IceCREAM method. It is also tested for the full polar regions, winter and summer, under clear and cloudy conditions. Our method is globally applicable, without fine-tuning or further weather filtering. The systematic use of all channels from 6 to 36 GHz makes it robust to changes in ice surface conditions and to weather interactions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3aimage analysis 3amicrowave radiation 3amicrowave radiometers 3amodels 3amoderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer 3aradiative transfer 3aremote sensing 3asatellites 3asea ice 3asummer 3aweather 3awinter 3aPolar Regions1 aKilic, Lise 1 aAires, Filipe 1 aPellet, Victor 1 aJimenez, Carlos 0 tRemote Sensing.g2020 May 17, v. 12, no. 10dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:26717x2072-42927nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs121015943Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02866naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100002300188245013100211300001800342506007600360520139400436592002801830506003701858650001401895650001601909650001101925650000801936650001601944650001301960650001701973650001201990650002302002650002002025650002302045650001902068650001802087700001902105700002802124700002102152700001802173773011502191856008102306852000902387655001202396IND60466296920221207064155.0151123e201512  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6046629692DNAL7 a10.1007/s13197-015-1957-22doi7 aPMC46488972pmcid7 a266043502pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMartuscelli, Maria10aTechnological approach to reduce NaCl content of traditional smoked dry-cured hams: effect on quality properties and stability  ap. 7771-7782.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe modification of the salting procedure (from a three- to a two-salt coverage steps) and its effects on quality and stability properties has been investigated to reduce NaCl content of traditional dry-cured ham. The study was applied on green hams of small-S and large-L weight classes. Results evidenced that a two-salt coverage steps salting could be applied to reduce significantly NaCl content of S-size hams and to reach the physico-chemical conditions required for microbial stability at the end of ripening. The final salt content of the products results (p < 0.05) to depend on salting procedure and initial weight of the hams, while limited differences on quality properties have been observed being the latter mainly associated to the pattern of the volatile compounds. In particular, aldehydes and hexanal content were lower in hams undergone to a 2-steps salting. Sensory analysis evidenced that the hams with reduced NaCl (2s-S and 2s-L) were less easy to chew, less salty and with a lower intensity of the smoky flavour in respect to the 3s- ones. The study confirmed the feasibility of salt content reduction of traditional dry-cured hams by modifying the salting process. However, the weight of the initial tights resulted a critical factor in affecting salting diffusion, salt content and water activity of the ripened products, their quality and stability properties.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aaldehydes 3acured meats 3aflavor 3aham 3amastication 3aripening 3asalt content 3asalting 3asensory evaluation 3asodium chloride 3avolatile compounds 3awater activity 3awater content1 aLupieri, Laura1 aChaves-Lopez, Clemencia1 aMastrocola, Dino1 aPittia, Paola0 tJournal of food science and technology.g2015 Dec., v. 52, no. 12 p.7771-7782dSpringer Indiax0022-11557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13197-015-1957-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02464naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245013700159300001800296500002000314520096600334592002801300596012001328596006301448596006801511650001201579650001401591650001301605650000901618650001301627650000901640650002301649650002401672650002301696700006101719700002201780700001501802773015301817856007501970852000902045655001202054IND60755493520221119155631.0211103e202111  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075549352DNAL7 a10.1111/ijfs.150822doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Yan‐ping10aTechnological and functional properties of reduced‐salt pork batter incorporated with soy protein isolate after pressure treatment  ap. 5581-5588.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aTo investigate the effects of different pressures (0.1–400 MPa), the techno‐functional properties, water distribution and mobility of reduced‐salt pork batters (1% NaCl) supplemented with soy protein isolate (SPI, 2%) were examined. Compared with the batters treated at 0.1 MPa, those treated at 100–300 MPa showed significantly increased the cooking yield, hardness, springiness, cohesiveness, chewiness, and G′ values of gel and reduced the initial relaxation times of T₂b, T₂₁ and T₂₂, as observed from the results of low‐field NMR. Among all samples, those treated at 200 and 300 MPa had the highest L* value, cooking yield, hardness, springiness, cohesiveness, chewiness and G′ value of gel, with the largest peak ratio of P₂₁ and the smallest peak ratio of P₂₂. Overall, treatments at 200 and 300 MPa improved the gel properties and lowered the water mobility of reduced‐salt pork batters supplemented with SPI.  aPublisher supplied data  aPRKX2020Z23cOpen Foundation Project of Key Laboratory of Sichuan Province Universities for Cooking Science in 2020  a212300410344cNatural Science Foundation of Henan Province  a2018GGJS114cHenan province key young teachers training program 3abatters 3achewiness 3acohesion 3agels 3ahardness 3apork 3apressure treatment 3asoy protein isolate 3awater distribution1 aKang, Zhuang‐li1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5052-01731 aSukmanov, Valerii1 aMa, Hanjun0 tInternational journal of food science & technology.g2021 Nov., v. 56, no. 11 p.5581-5588dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl41365x0950-54237nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ijfs.150823Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01450naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001400144245002300158300001600181520037300197592002800570650002000598650001400618650001800632650001300650650001500663650000900678651001700687653002500704653001300729653002200742700001800764700002500782700001600807700001500823773013800838856007900976852000901055655001201064IND60752889120221118183937.0211008e20210118xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075288912DNAL7 a10.1139/cjps-2020-02982doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEynck, C.10aSES0787LS camelina  ap. 783-785.  aSES0787LS is a camelina (Camelina sativa) cultivar developed at Smart Earth Camelina Corporation in Saskatoon, SK.

Understanding the mechanism of this selectivity will enable better polymeric vectors to be designed, with inherent selectivity for specific cell types based on intracellular differences and not on the use of targeting ligands, which have shown variable success, depending on the system. It is assumed that the selectivity was due to different intracellular barriers to transfection in the different cell types. Part I focuses on investigating whether cellular entry is one of the barriers to transfection, through conjugation of epidermal growth factor (EGF) to the pentablock copolymer vector. Results indicate that EGF conjugation increased transfection efficiency the most when conjugated to the outer surface of polyplexes, with minimal disruption to DNA packaging and maximal accessibility to receptors. The overall resulting enhancement in transfection, however, was a moderate three- to five-fold increase compared with the condition with no EGF involved, implying that the addition of EGF fails to overcome the intracellular barrier to transfection, which probably involves some step other than cellular uptake in pentablock copolymer system. Therefore, the differences observed in the selectivity of transfection between cancer and normal cell lines is probably not controlled by differences in cellular entry, and the intracellular barriers to transfection in this system are likely to be endosomal escape or nuclear entry, as investigated in Part II, the companion paper to this work.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3acomposite polymers 3aepidermal growth factor 3areceptors 3atransfection 2aBuffers 2aCell Deathxdrug effects 2aCell Line, Tumor 2aEndocytosisxdrug effects 2aEpidermal Growth Factorxmetabolism 2aHumans 2aLuciferasesxmetabolism 2aMethacrylatesxchemistryxpharmacology. 2aMicroscopy, Atomic Force 2aMicroscopy, Confocal 2aParticle Size 2aPoloxamerxchemistryxpharmacology. 2aTransfectionxmethods1 aMallapragada, Surya0 tActa biomaterialia.g2011 Apr., v. 7, no. 4 p.1570-1579dElsevier Ltdx1742-70617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.actbio.2010.11.0323Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02232naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002400150245009000174300001600264520099300280592002801273650002701301650000901328650002501337650001301362650002001375650001201395650001301407650001301420650001301433650002401446653003101470653002601501653001201527653002301539653003301562700002201595773011201617856008401729852000901813655001201822IND60123693720221121192207.0150330e20140901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012369372DNAL7 a10.1080/08941920.2014.9058872doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJohnson, Branden B.10aBeliefs about Ecological Impacts Predict Deer Acceptance Capacity and Hunting Support  ap. 915-930.  aEcological impacts of deer overbrowsing often lead resource managers to recommend deer control through hunting, which may be strongly opposed by local residents. Adaptive impact management argues that understanding wildlife impacts of concern to the public can improve wildlife management. However, research on public wildlife acceptance capacity for deer, and on support for hunting, has emphasized concerns about household impacts and deer well-being, general environmental beliefs and attitudes, and beliefs about consequences of hunting, but not public concerns about deer ecological impacts. Our survey of neighbors of urban wetlands shows that beliefs about deer ecological impacts are statistically significant predictors of deer acceptance capacity and of support for hunting, controlling for other factors. Including ecological-impact beliefs adds substantially to the explained variance in deer acceptance capacity, and slightly to the explained variance in support for hunting.  aPublisher supplied data 3aattitudes and opinions 3adeer 3aenvironmental impact 3amanagers 3apublic research 3asurveys 3avariance 3awetlands 3awildlife 3awildlife management 0aadaptive impact management 0aenvironmental impacts 0ahunting 0apublic perceptions 0awildlife acceptance capacity1 aHorowitz, Leah S.0 tSociety & natural resources.g2014 Sept. 1, v. 27, no. 9 p.915-930dTaylor & Francis Groupx1521-07237nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/08941920.2014.9058873Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01877naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100001800112245009100130300001600221500001900237520098400256592002801240650002901268650001301297650001301310650000901323650000901332650001601341650001401357650001001371650001001381700001801391773013301409852000901542655001201551IND60721308620221120164807.0201224e201001  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072130862DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMaurya, B.

The weed left as such in soil of the area acts as a seed bank due to its higher seed production capacity and extended dormancy period. Composting of Parthenium is recommended as the seeds deprive their viability due to the generation of high heat during composting (Ramamoorthy el al., 2003). However, insufficient temperature in compost piles is unable to complete destruction of the weed seeds viability to check the germination of seeds in its compost (Laxmi and Gupta, 2008). In an experiment with wheat, authors have also observed the growth of Parthenium plants in pots which have received self prepared Parthenium compost where temperature during active composting stage was 55°C. Aim of the present investigation was to know the probable reason for the germination of Parthenium seeds in its compost and find out the suitable way of its utilization so that its hazards could be minimized.  aPublisher supplied data 3aParthenium hysterophorus 3acomposts 3adormancy 3aheat 3asoil 3atemperature 3aviability 3aweeds 3awheat1 aSharma, P.

Here, we show that AGLF is not only involved in flower development but also the compound leaf formation. The aglf mutant exhibits the clustered leaflets, suggesting a trend towards the decreased leaf complexity. Similarly, the ortholog of LEAFY in M. truncatula, SINGLE LEAFLET1 (SGL1), also plays critical roles in both flower and compound leaf development. However, the mutants of the ABC model genes downstream of AGLF and SGL1 display the normal leaves. These data suggest that AGLF and SGL1 regulate floral organ identity through ABC model, but are probably involved in other pathways to control compound leaf development.  aThis work was supported by grants from the Ministry of Science and Technology of China [2015CB943500], the National Natural Science Foundation of Shandong Province [ZR2014CQ022, ZR2018ZC0334].  aPublisher supplied data  aZR2014CQ022cNational Natural Science Foundation of Shandong Province  aZR2018ZC0334cNational Natural Science Foundation of Shandong Province  a2015CB943500cMinistry of Science and Technology of China0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aMedicago truncatula 3acompound leaves 3aflowering 3aflowers 3agenes 3aleaf development 3amodels 3amutants 0aCompound leaf development/AGLF/SGL1/Medicago truncatula1 aZhao, Yang1 aLiu, Rong1 aZhou, Chuanen0 tPlant signaling & behavior.g2019 July 3, v. 14, no. 7 p.1612683-dTaylor & FranciswJournal:2184x1559-23247nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15592324.2019.16126833Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01483naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001500143245007600158300001600234520039400250592002800644650001200672650001300684650002100697650004400718650001900762650001400781653003500795653001400830653001800844700001900862700001600881773015000897856007701047852000901124655001201133IND60521519620221123023324.0160530e20140602xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052151962DNAL7 a10.1515/znb-1977-02162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMintas, M.14aThe Preparation of Some Unsymmetrically 2,2′ -Disubstituted Stilbenes  ap. 181-183.  aThe new unsymmetrically 2,2′-disubstituted stilbenes with NO₂, F, Cl, Br, OCH₃, CH₃ and NH₂ groups as substituents have been prepared by WITTIG or PERKIN reactions.

After calculating the TLS angular resolution, the algorithm identifies the missing laser hits (gaps) within an angular grid in the azimuthal and zenithal directions. The algorithm was first tested on angular data simulations with random (R), cluster (C) and random and cluster together (RC) gap pattern distributions. Noise introduced in the simulations as a percentage of the resolution accounted for the effect of TLS angular uncertainty. The algorithm performs accurately if angular noise is <6% of the angular resolution. To assess the impact of the change in projection, this study compared these GF estimates from angular grid simulations to their transformation into simulated hemispherical images (SHI). SHI with C patterns perform accurately, but R and RC patterns underestimate GF, especially for GF values below 0.6. The SHI performance to estimate GF was always far below the algorithm developed here with the angular grid simulations. When applied to actual TLS data acquired over individual Quercus ilex L. trees, the algorithm rendered a GF between 0.26 and 0.40. TLS had an angular noise <6%. Converting the angular grid into simulated HI (TLS-SHI) provided a better agreement with actual HI acquired in the same location as the TLS data, since they are in the same projection. The TLS-SHI underestimated GF by an average of 4% compared to HI. HI and TLS-SHI presented 14% and 17% lower values than the GF calculated from the angular grids, respectively. Nevertheless, the results from the simulations indicate that the algorithm based on the angular grid should be closer to the actual GF of the tree canopy.  aPublisher supplied data 3aQuercus ilex 3aalgorithms 3acanopy gaps 3adata collection 3aremote sensing 3ascanners 3atrees 3auncertainty1 aRiaño, David,1 aGarcía, Mariano 1 aSalas, Javier 1 aMartín, M.

The present study was undertaken for the development of low fat goshtaba with the addition of xanthan gum as a fat replacer and was evaluated for proximate composition, pH, colour, lipid and protein oxidation, texture, microstructure and sensory properties. Low fat goshtaba formulations containing xanthan gum were higher in protein and moisture contents but, lower in fat content and pH value than the high fat control (p < 0.05). Colour evaluation revealed that high fat goshtaba had significantly higher L* value, but lower a* value than its low fat counterparts (p < 0.05). The significant decrease of TBARS values, protein carbonyls and loss of protein sulphydryl groups in low fat goshtaba formulations reflects the potential antioxidant activity of xanthan gum (p < 0.05). Hardness was significantly higher in high fat control but, cohesiveness, gumminess, and chewiness did not show any significant difference. Springiness increased with the increasing concentration of xanthan gum (0.5–1.5 %) and was higher in low fat product containing 1.5 % xanthan gum. SEM results indicate that xanthan gum lead to formation of an additional gel network which holds more water. Sensory evaluation revealed that goshtaba product with 0.5 % xanthan gum had quality characteristics that were similar to the control product containing 20 % fat.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aantioxidant activity 3achewiness 3acohesion 3acolor 3acondiments 3afat replacers 3agels 3ahardness 3alipid content 3alipids 3ameat emulsions 3amicrostructure 3aoxidation 3aoxidative stability 3apH 3aproximate composition 3arestructured meat 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asensory evaluation 3asensory properties 3aspices 3atexture 3athiobarbituric acid-reactive substances 3axanthan gum 3aIndia1 aMasoodi, F.

ST values were measured at three separate time points in normal dogs and on days 3, 10 and 30 following decompressive surgery in dogs with SCI. ST values were compared between groups and correlated with locomotor recovery in SCI-affected dogs.ST values were significantly higher (consistent with hypoalgesia) in the pelvic limbs of SCI-affected dogs at day 3, day 10 and day 30 when compared to normal dogs (P < 0.05), while no significant difference in thoracic limb ST values was observed between groups. A progressive decrease in pelvic limb ST values occurred in SCI-affected dogs over time, consistent with improvement toward normal sensation or development of allodynia. This finding correlated inversely with locomotor score at 3 and 10 days after surgery. A significant decline in ST values across testing sessions was observed for all limbs of normal and SCI-affected dogs and may be related to patient acclimation, operator training effect, or effect of analgesic medications. This study supports the feasibility of VFA to assess differences in ST between normal and SCI-affected dogs. However, future studies must focus on techniques to minimize or compensate for clinical, environmental and behavioral factors which may impact ST values in the clinical setting.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aacclimation 3aanalgesic effect 3aanimal injuries 3adogs 3aextrusion 3aintervertebral disks 3apatients 3asensation 3asomatosensory disorders 3aspinal cord 3asurgery 0aSpinal cord injury 0aQuantitative sensory testing 0avon Frey anesthesiometer 0aSensory threshold 0aCanine1 aBasso, D.M.1 ada Costa, R.C.1 aFisher, L.C.1 aMo, X.1 aMoore, S.A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4311-61990 tveterinary journal.g2016 Mar., v. 209 p.144-149dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl55231x1090-02337nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tvjl.2015.07.0283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01048naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002000143245012600163300001600289520008200305592002800387650001700415650001100432650002000443653001700463653001600480700002600496773015000522856007700672852000900749655001200758IND60521519820221123014519.0160530e20140602xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052151982DNAL7 a10.1515/znb-1977-02182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFlaskamp, Elmar10aDarstellung von spezifisch D- und 18O-markierten Cardenoliden / Synthesis of Specifically D and 18O Labelled Cardenolides  ap. 187-192.  aThe synthesis of specifically labelled (D, ¹⁸O) cardenolides is described.  aPublisher supplied data 3acardenolides 3aoxygen 3astable isotopes 0aCardenolides 0aD-Labelling1 aBudzikiewicz, Herbert0 tZeitschrift für Naturforschung.g2014 June 2, v. 32, no. 2 p.187-192dVerlag der Zeitschrift für NaturforschungwJournal:23182x0932-07767nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1515/znb-1977-02183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02726naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002000140245013100160520162400291592002801915650001501943650002201958650001301980650001901993650001502012650003002027650001502057700002502072700003202097700002302129700002402152773012802176856007502304852000902379655001202388IND60704002920221118012250.0200722e20200517xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070400292DNAL7 a10.3390/rs121016012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCiani, Daniele 10aImproving the Altimeter-Derived Surface Currents Using Sea Surface Temperature (SST) Data: A Sensitivity Study to SST Products  aMeasurements of ocean surface topography collected by satellite altimeters provide geostrophic estimates of the sea surface currents at relatively low resolution. The effective spatial and temporal resolution of these velocity estimates can be improved by optimally combining altimeter data with sequences of high resolution interpolated (Level 4) Sea Surface Temperature (SST) data, improving upon present-day values of approximately 100 km and 15 days at mid-latitudes. However, the combined altimeter/SST currents accuracy depends on the area and input SST data considered. Here, we present a comparative study based on three satellite-derived daily SST products: the Remote Sensing Systems (REMSS, 1/10 ∘ resolution), the UK Met Office OSTIA (1/20 ∘ resolution), and the Multiscale Ultra-High resolution SST (1/100 ∘ resolution). The accuracy of the marine currents computed with our synergistic approach is assessed by comparisons with in-situ estimated currents derived from a global network of drifting buoys. Using REMSS SST, the meridional currents improve up to more than 20% compared to simple altimeter estimates. The maximum global improvements for the zonal currents are obtained using OSTIA SST, and reach 6%. Using the OSTIA SST also results in slight improvements (≃1.3%) in the zonal flow estimated in the Southern Ocean (45 ∘ S to 70 ∘ S). The homogeneity of the input SST effective spatial resolution is identified as a crucial requirement for an accurate surface current reconstruction. In our analyses, this condition was best satisfied by the lower resolution SST products considered.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaltimeters 3acomparative study 3alatitude 3aremote sensing 3asatellites 3asurface water temperature 3atopography1 aRio, Marie-Hélène 1 aNardelli, Bruno  Buongiorno1 aEtienne, Hélène 1 aSantoleri, Rosalia 0 tRemote Sensing.g2020 May 17, v. 12, no. 10dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:26717x2072-42927nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs121016013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02477naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100002100188245013300209300001800342506007600360520098400436592002801420506003701448650002501485650001401510650002401524650001401548650000901562650001001571650002101581650001401602650001601616650000801632650001601640650001501656650001201671650001401683700002601697700002301723700002101746700002301767773011501790856008101905852000901986655001201995IND60466297320221207064151.0151123e201512  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6046629732DNAL7 a10.1007/s13197-015-1971-42doi7 aPMC46489292pmcid7 a266044042pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLantano, Claudia10aEffects of alternative steeping methods on composition, antioxidant property and colour of green, black and oolong tea infusions  ap. 8276-8283.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aCold water steeping is reported to maximise tea health benefits, but requires long infusion time. In this work, the employment of a brief hot infusion step followed by ice addition was evaluated. The comparison of this innovative method with hot and cold steeping was investigated on green, black and oolong teas. Catechins, xanthines and gallic acid content, antioxidant power, total phenolics and colour analysis were evaluated. Hot infusion shown rapid extractive power, but relevant compound degradation. On the contrary, cold infusion extracted higher level of healthy molecules with slow kinetic. The innovative method achieved in short time similar properties of cold infusion in terms of antioxidant power. As for bioactive compounds, such as gallic acid and epigallocatechin gallate, highest values, about double than in hot infusion, were recorded for green and black teas. This steeping method may represent an alternative approach for industrial beverage preparation.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aantioxidant activity 3abeverages 3abioactive compounds 3ablack tea 3acold 3acolor 3aepigallocatechin 3aflavanols 3agallic acid 3aice 3amethodology 3aoolong tea 3asoaking 3axanthines1 aRinaldi, Massimiliano1 aCavazza, Antonella1 aBarbanti, Davide1 aCorradini, Claudio0 tJournal of food science and technology.g2015 Dec., v. 52, no. 12 p.8276-8283dSpringer Indiax0022-11557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13197-015-1971-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03457naa a2200637 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100002600188245011500214300001800329506007600347520149000423592002801913506003701941650003401978650001602012650001902028650002402047650002502071650002102096650001202117650001102129650001802140650002002158650002602178650002702204650001902231650002002250650002802270650002502298650001802323650001402341650002002355650002402375650002402399650000702423650001402430650001102444650002302455650000902478651001002487700002502497700001802522700002002540700002102560700002102581773011502602856008102717852000902798655001202807IND60466297420221207064224.0151123e201512  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6046629742DNAL7 a10.1007/s13197-015-1978-x2doi7 aPMC46488932pmcid7 a266044052pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMajumdar, Ranendra K.10aBiochemical and microbial characterization of Ngari and Hentaak - traditional fermented fish products of India  ap. 8284-8291.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aNgari and hentaak are the two most preferred traditional salt-free fermented fish products of North-Eastern (NE) states of India. Chemical and microbial composition, antioxidative potential, fatty acid profile and electrophoretic pattern of protein in ngari and hentaak were studied. pH and total titratable acidity (TTA) of the products justified their stability at ambient temperature. Both ngari and hentaak showed higher contents of calcium (362.79 ± 26.89, 472.11 ± 62.7); sodium (199.66 ± 24.92, 94.0 ± 12.78); potassium (58.20 ± 7.36, 75.74 ± 6.62) and magnesium (16.056 ± 3.89, 21.125 ± 3.78) respectively. Iron, copper and zinc were found in lesser amount. DPPH · radical scavenging activity was close to 87 % in both the products and the ferric chloride reducing power assay was dose dependent in both the products. Both omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids were found in ngari; whereas, only omega-3 fatty acids were observed in hentaak. Linoleic acid (11.68 %) and arachidonic acid (0.65 %) were the n-6 PUFA in ngari; while, in hentaak, it was only arachidonic acid (8.54 %). Apart from essential fatty acids, essential amino acids were also found in considerable quantity in both the products. Micrococcus sp. and Staphylococcus sp. were found to be the dominant bacterial genus in both the products; while Ngari also had lactic acid bacteria group. The nutritional properties afforded by these products justify their preference by the population.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3a2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl 3aMicrococcus 3aStaphylococcus 3aambient temperature 3aantioxidant activity 3aarachidonic acid 3acalcium 3acopper 3adose response 3aelectrophoresis 3aessential amino acids 3afatty acid composition 3afermented fish 3aferric chloride 3afree radical scavengers 3alactic acid bacteria 3alinoleic acid 3amagnesium 3anutritive value 3aomega-3 fatty acids 3aomega-6 fatty acids 3apH 3apotassium 3asodium 3atitratable acidity 3azinc 3aIndia1 aBejjanki, Sandeep K.1 aRoy, Deepayan1 aShitole, Snehal1 aSāhā, Apūrba,1 aNarayan, Bhaskar0 tJournal of food science and technology.g2015 Dec., v. 52, no. 12 p.8284-8291dSpringer Indiax0022-11557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13197-015-1978-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02930naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001400150245016700164500001900331520133000350592002801680650002801708650001901736650001901755650001201774650001201786650002501798650001101823650001901834650001401853650001501867650000901882650002301891650001101914650001901925650001101944651001001955653003201965653001401997653002402011653001602035653003402051700001602085700001702101700002002118700001402138700001802152700001702170773010702187856008502294852000902379655001202388IND60701557020221120163836.0200913e202011  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070155702DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envpol.2020.1151662doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZeng, Jie10aDetermining rainwater chemistry to reveal alkaline rain trend in Southwest China: Evidence from a frequent-rainy karst area with extensive agricultural production  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aRainwater chemistry plays an important role in the earth-surficial ecosystem, but studies on rainwater chemical composition of karst agro-ecosystem are rare. To explore the rainwater alkalization and the provenance of components responsible for neutralization, two-years chemical monitoring of rainwater was carried out in a karst agricultural catchment in Southwest China. The main findings suggest that SO₄²⁻, NO₃⁻, Ca²⁺, and NH₄⁺ are the principal ions. All the ionic contents show distinctly seasonal variation (highest in winter) in response to variations in seasonal precipitation because the rain-scour process can efficiently remove atmospheric materials. Source identification indicates that Cl⁻ and Na⁺ are mainly derived from marine input whereas SO₄²⁻ and NO₃⁻ are controlled by anthropogenic emission, in particular, fixed emission sources. The source of NH₄⁺ is attributed to intense agricultural production, while Ca²⁺ and Mg²⁺ are mainly derived from calcite dissolution. The rainwater alkalization caused by the seasonal acid neutralization (via basic components, Ca²⁺ and NH₄⁺) is beneficial to crop growth but also reflect agricultural overfertilization. Sulfur controlled the total wet acid deposition (68%–94%) and could be a potential agent of weathering.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural watersheds 3aagroecosystems 3aalkalinization 3acalcite 3acalcium 3achemical composition 3akarsts 3aneutralization 3apollution 3aprovenance 3arain 3aseasonal variation 3asulfur 3awet deposition 3awinter 3aChina 0aAtmospheric acid substances 0aRainwater 0aAcid neutralization 0aIon sources 0aKarst agricultural production1 aYue, Fu-Jun1 aLi, Si-Liang1 aWang, Zhong-Jun1 aWu, Qixin1 aQin, Cai-Qing1 aYan, Ze-Long0 tEnvironmental pollution.g2020 Nov., v. 266 p.115166-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl41014x0269-74917nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2020.1151663Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01769naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100001600112245007900128300001600207500001900223520079900242592002801041650001401069650001001083650001501093650001201108650001701120650001001137653002801147653003701175653004601212700001501258700001601273773013301289852000901422655001201431IND60721309220221120154410.0201224e201101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072130922DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSingh, B.P.10aEffect of different herbicides on weeds and lac yield in bhalia plantation  ap. 149-152.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aSeveral herbicides were evaluated for their possibility of use in the lac production system under Flemingia semialata in the Research Farm of Indian Institute of Natural Resins and Gums, Ranchi.

This research aims to understand the genotypic variation in growth and photosynthesis in mature cacao trees in response to elevated CO₂ and water deficit. Six genotypes were grown under greenhouse conditions at ambient (ca. 437 ppm) and elevated CO₂ (ca. 724 ppm) and under well-watered and water deficit conditions for 23 months. Leaf- and canopy-level photosynthesis, water-use efficiency, and vegetative growth increased significantly in response to elevated CO₂. Water deficit had a significant negative effect on many photosynthetic parameters and significantly reduced biomass production. The negative effect of water deficit on quantum efficiency was alleviated by elevated CO₂. Genotypic variation was observed in several parameters including stomatal conductance, stomatal density and index, quantum efficiency, and biomass production, indicating the potential to develop more climate-change-resilient genotypes that can cope with predicted future climate change conditions. Elevated CO₂ reduced some of the negative effects of water deficit through changes in water-use efficiency and light utilisation and reduced the negative impact of water deficit on biomass accumulation, but this was genotype-specific.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagronomy 3abiomass production 3acarbon dioxide 3acarbon dioxide enrichment 3aclimate change 3agenetic variation 3agreenhouses 3aphotosynthesis 3astomatal conductance 3atropical plants 3avegetative growth 3awater use efficiency1 aHandley, Liam  R.1 aHadley, Paul 1 aDaymond, Andrew  J.0 tAgronomy.g2021 Apr. 22, v. 11, no. 5dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:12361x2073-43957nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agronomy110508183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02165naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002100150245010100171300001800272520099300290592002801283650002001311650001401331650002501345650002001370653002001390653002601410653003601436700002101472700001601493700002201509700002101531700002001552773011401572856008401686961001201770852000901782655001201791IND60123694320221121221933.0150330e20141003xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012369432DNAL7 a10.1080/08941920.2014.9058952doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStidham, Melanie10aLongitudinal Social Science Research in Natural Resource Communities: Lessons and Considerations  ap. 1104-1108.  aThe majority of social science research is cross-sectional in nature, with data collected at a single point in time. However, social systems are dynamic and many of the variables of interest to social scientists may change over time. Longitudinal research methods enable data collection at two or more points in time among a population of interest to examine change in measured variables and influencing factors. Despite the opportunities it affords, longitudinal research is relatively uncommon in natural-resource-based social science research as compared to other fields (e.g., medical, criminal, education). We feel that the field of natural resource social science is ripe for a proliferation of longitudinal studies, now that a substantial body of cross-sectional data has been built. In the spirit of encouraging more of this type of research, we draw on our collective experiences in longitudinal studies to share lessons learned in research design, sampling, and data management.  aPublisher supplied data 3adata collection 3aeducation 3alongitudinal studies 3asocial sciences 0alessons learned 0alongitudinal research 0anatural resource social science1 aOlsen, Christine1 aToman, Eric1 aFrederick, Stacey1 aMcCaffrey, Sarah1 aShindler, Bruce0 tSociety & natural resources.g2014 Oct. 3, v. 27, no. 10 p.1104-1108dTaylor & Francis Groupx1521-07237nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/08941920.2014.9058953Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/FS  aDNAL 7aarticle02015naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100005700147245006200204300001200266520102400278592002801302650001501330650001901345650001201364650001901376650001401395650002001409700005901429773013401488856008201622852000901704655001201713IND60592105220221118050819.0200509e201803  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059210522DNAL7 a10.1007/s12665-018-7438-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFleming, RexJ.1http://orcid.org/0000-0003-0173-684813aAn updated review about carbon dioxide and climate change  ap. 262.  aThis manuscript will review the essence of the role of CO₂ in the Earth’s atmosphere. The logic of CO₂ involvement in changing the climate will be investigated from every perspective: reviewing the historical data record, examining in further detail the twentieth-century data record, and evaluating the radiation role of CO₂ in the atmosphere—calculating and integrating the Schwarzschild radiation equation with a full complement of CO₂ absorption coefficients. A review of the new theory of climate change—due to the Sun’s magnetic field interacting with cosmic rays, is provided. The application of this new theory is applied to climate-change events within the latter part of the Earth’s interglacial period. The application to the Earth’s Ice Ages is not detailed here due to manuscript size constraints, but is referenced for the reader. The results of this review point to the extreme value of CO₂ to all life forms, but no role of CO₂ in any significant change of the Earth’s climate.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3acarbon dioxide 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3aequations 3amagnetic fields1 aFleming, Rex J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0173-68480 tEnvironmental earth sciences.g2018 Mar., v. 77, no. 6 p.262-262dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:J000001228x1866-62807nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12665-018-7438-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03293naa a2200661 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003800113040001800151100001700169245010900186300001800295520127800313592002801591650001401619650001301633650001601646650001401662650001701676650001701693650002401710650001101734650001701745650002501762650001201787650001301799650002001812650001801832650002601850650004401876650001401920650001601934650001201950650001501962650003701977650004202014650003602056650002402092650002902116650003402145650002302179650003102202650004902233650002902282650002702311650001202338650001702350700001202367700001502379700001802394773009102412856008402503990002302587852000902610655001202619IND60087342620221117165503.0141102e201104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008734262DNAL7 a211454372pmid7 a10.1016/j.actbio.2010.12.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHu, Xiaohong10aBiological hydrogel synthesized from hyaluronic acid, gelatin and chondroitin sulfate by click chemistry  ap. 1618-1626.  aIn order to mimic the natural cartilage extracellular matrix, which is composed of core proteins and glycosaminoglycans, a biological hydrogel was synthesized from the biopolymers hyaluronic acid (HA), chondroitin sulfate (CS) and gelatin via click chemistry. HA and CS were modified with 11-azido-3,6,9-trioxaundecan-1-amine (AA) and gelatin was modified with propiolic acid (PA). The molecular structures were verified by ¹H nuclear magnetic resonance, infrared spectroscopy and elemental analysis, giving substitution degrees of 29%, 89% and 44% for HA–AA, CS–AA and gelatin–PA (G–PA), respectively. The –N₃ groups of HA–AA and CS–AA were reacted with the acetylene groups of G–PA, catalyzed by Cu(I), to form triazole rings, thereby forming a cross-linked hydrogel. The gelation time was decreased monotonically with increasing Cu(I) concentration up to 0.95mgml⁻¹. The hydrogel obtained was in a highly swollen state and showed the characteristics of an elastomer. Incubation in phosphate-buffered saline for 4weeks resulted in a weight loss of up to 45%. Moreover, about 20% gelatin and 10% CS were released from the hydrogel in 2weeks. In vitro cell culture showed that the hydrogel could support the adhesion and proliferation of chondrocytes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetylene 3aadhesion 3abiopolymers 3acartilage 3acell culture 3achondrocytes 3achondroitin sulfate 3acopper 3acrosslinking 3aextracellular matrix 3agelatin 3agelation 3ahyaluronic acid 3ahydrocolloids 3ainfrared spectroscopy 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3atriazoles 3aweight loss 2aAnimals 2aCell Count 2aCell Proliferationxdrug effects 2aChondrocytesxcytologyxdrug effects. 2aChondroitin Sulfatesxchemistry 2aChromatography, Gel 2aClick Chemistryxmethods 2aElastic Modulusxdrug effects 2aGelatinxchemistry 2aHyaluronic Acidxchemistry 2aHydrogelsxchemical synthesisxpharmacology. 2aMicroscopy, Fluorescence 2aMolecular Conformation 2aRabbits 2aTime Factors1 aLi, Dan1 aZhou, Feng1 aGao, Changyou0 tActa biomaterialia.g2011 Apr., v. 7, no. 4 p.1618-1626dElsevier Ltdx1742-70617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.actbio.2010.12.0053Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle01927naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002100143245006700164300001600231520089600247592002801143650001201171650001701183650001301200650002301213650001301236650001201249650001201261650001301273650001501286700002801301700002501329773013701354856007701491852000901568655001201577IND60521520220221120152025.0160530e20140602xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052152022DNAL7 a10.1515/znb-1977-02222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNaderwitz, Peter10aPhotolysis (λ =185 nm) of Liquid Pivalaldehyde Dimethyl Aceta  ap. 209-212.  aDeoxygenated liquid pivalaldehyde dimethyl acetal was photolyzed at λ = 185 nm, and 28 products have been determined. The major ones and their quantum yields are: methyl formate (0.47), isobutene (0.39), methane (0.28), neopentane (0.16), isobutane (0.13), formaldehyde dimethyl acetal (0.13), formaldehyde (0.09), methyl neopentyl ether (0.09), methanol (0.07), and methyl pivalate (0.04). The predominant primary photoprocesses are suggested to be the scission of the O–CH₃ bond (homolytic, 0.51; molecular, 0.04) and the C-tBu bond (homolytic and molecular, 0.16). Minor processes are the scission of the C–OCH₃ (molecular, 0.09; homolytic, 0.03), C–H (0.006), and C–CH₃ bonds (&lt; 0.01). The radical (A) eliminates with ease t-butyl (reaction (i)).

The detection of aflatoxin and aflatoxigenic fungi on raw material is a major concern to protect health, secure food and feed, and preserve their value. The effectiveness of image processing, combined with computational techniques, has been investigated to detect and segregate peanut (Arachis hypogaea L.) seeds infected with an aflatoxin producing fungus. After inoculation with Aspergillus flavus, images of peanuts seeds were taken using various lighting sources (LED, UV, and fluorescent lights) on two backgrounds (black and white) at 0, 48, and 72 h after inoculation. Images were post-processed with three different machine learning tools: the artificial neural network (ANN), the support vector machine (SVM), and the adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) to detect the Aspergillus flavus growth on peanuts. The results of the study show that the combination of LED light and a white background with ANN had 99.7% accuracy in detecting fungal growth on peanuts 72 h from infection with Aspergillus. Additionally, UV lights and a black background with ANFIS achieve 99.9% accuracy in detecting fungal growth on peanuts 48 h after their infection with Aspergillus.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArachis hypogaea 3aAspergillus flavus 3aAspergillus parasiticus 3aaflatoxins 3aagronomy 3aanimal and human health 3afeeds 3afluorescent lamps 3afungal growth 3afungi 3afuzzy logic 3aneural networks 3apeanuts 3araw materials 3aseeds 3asupport vector machines1 aFarzand Ahmadi, Vahid 1 aBazyar, Pourya 1 aCavallo, Eugenio 0 tAgronomy.g2021 Apr. 29, v. 11, no. 5dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:12361x2073-43957nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agronomy110508733Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01415naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004400094040001800138100001500156245007700171300001600248500001500264520035000279592002800629650001900657650001400676650001000690650002200700650002100722650003400743653003600777700001600813700001900829700001400848773010400862856009000966852000901056655001201065IND60439398720221120082104.0151024e200312  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6043939872DNAL7 a10.1023/B:BIOP.0000041065.85978.6d2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSharma, N.10aLipid Composition of in vitro Developing Seeds of Brassica campestris L.  ap. 581-584.  a2019-12-06  aA liquid culture technique has been developed to study lipid metabolism in seeds of Brassica campestris L. grown in vitro from terminal inflorescences detached 4 to 46 days after anthesis.

Polymerase Synthesis of DNA Probes Bearing Solvatochromic and pH-Sensitive Dual Fluorescent and 19F NMR Labels  ap. 1026-1044.  aThe design of four new fluorinated biaryl fluorescent labels and their attachment to nucleosides and nucleoside triphosphates (dNTPs) by the aqueous cross-coupling reactions of biarylboronates is reported. The modified dNTPs were good substrates for KOD XL polymerase and were enzymatically incorporated into DNA probes. The photophysical properties of the biaryl-modified nucleosides, dNTPs, and DNA were studied systematically. The different substitution pattern of the biaryls was used for tuning of emission maxima in the broad range of 366–565 nm. Using methods of computational chemistry the emission maxima were reproduced with a satisfactory degree of accuracy, and it was shown that the large solvatochromic shifts observed for the studied probes are proportional to the differences in dipole moments of the ground (S₀) and excited (S₁) states that add on top of smaller shifts predicted already for these systems in vacuo. Thus, we present a set of compounds that may serve as multipurpose base-discriminating fluorophores for sensing of hairpins, deletions, and mismatches by the change of emission maxima and intensities of fluorescence and that can be also conviently studied by ¹⁹F NMR spectroscopy. In addition, aminobenzoxazolyl-fluorophenyl-labeled nucleotides and DNA also exert dual pH-sensitive and solvatochromic fluorescence, which may imply diverse applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aDNA probes 3across-coupling reactions 3afluorescence 3afluorescent dyes 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3anucleosides 3anucleotides 3aorganic chemistry1 aPohl, Radek1 aRulíšek, Lubomír1 aHocek, Michal0 tJournal of organic chemistry.g2012 Jan. 20, v. 77, no. 2 p.1026-1044dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-69047nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fjo202321g3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02792naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100002400155245011900179300001600298520135900314592002801673650000801701650001301709650001201722650003901734650002101773650002401794650002301818650002901841650001101870650001801881650001901899650001901918650001401937650001401951653001901965653002201984653001402006653001202020653001002032700001502042700001402057700002002071773012002091856009002211852000902301655001202310IND50066060420221121234649.0190403e201305  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006606042DNAL7 a10.1016/j.anireprosci.2013.02.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKershaw-Young, C.M.14aThe effect of glycosaminoglycan enzymes and proteases on the viscosity of alpaca seminal plasma and sperm function  ap. 261-267.  aIn order to advance the development of cryopreservation and other assisted reproductive technologies in camelids it is necessary to eliminate the viscous component of the seminal plasma without impairing sperm function. It has been postulated that glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) or proteoglycans are responsible for this viscosity. This study investigated the effect of the GAG enzymes hyaluronidase, chondroitinase ABC and keratanase and the proteases papain and proteinase K on seminal plasma viscosity and sperm function in order to aid identification of the cause of seminal plasma viscosity and propose methods for the reduction of viscosity.Sperm motility, DNA integrity, acrosome integrity and viability were assessed during 2h incubation. All enzymes reduced seminal plasma viscosity compared to control (P<0.001) although papain was most effective, completely eliminating viscosity within 30min of treatment. Sperm motility and DNA integrity was not affected by enzyme treatment. The proportion of viable, acrosome intact sperm was reduced in all enzyme treated samples except those treated with papain (P<0.001).These findings suggest that proteins, not GAGs are the main cause of alpaca seminal plasma viscosity. Papain treatment of alpaca semen may be a suitable technique for reduction of seminal plasma viscosity prior to sperm cryopreservation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aacrosome 3aalpacas 3aassisted reproductive technologies 3acryopreservation 3aenzymatic treatment 3aglycosaminoglycans 3ahyaluronoglucosaminidase 3apapain 3aproteoglycans 3aseminal plasma 3asperm motility 3aviability 3aviscosity 0aSeminal plasma 0aGlycosaminoglycan 0aViscosity 0aCamelid 0aSperm1 aStuart, C.1 aEvans, G.1 aMaxwell, W.M.C.0 tAnimal reproduction science.g2013 May, v. 138, no. 3-4 p.261-267dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl11636x0378-43207nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.anireprosci.2013.02.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03154naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245011300165300001600278520142300294592002801717650002501745650001101770650002501781650001301806650001201819650002301831650001801854650001501872650001101887650003601898650002201934650002101956650001901977650001601996650001302012650001502025650002302040650003202063650002502095650002102120650002502141653002002166653002402186653002302210653002502233700001602258700001602274700001602290700001202306700001302318700001402331773012702345856008302472852000902555655001202564IND60633979220221119211145.0190502e201904  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063397922DNAL7 a10.1016/j.pmpp.2019.03.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGe, Yonghong10aEffect of trisodium phosphate treatment on black spot of apple fruit and the roles of anti-oxidative enzymes  ap. 226-231.  aBlack spot caused by Alternaria alternata is an important postharvest disease of apple fruit. In this study, apple fruit (cv. Golden delicious) was used as the materials to study the effects of 0.25, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0 mg/mL trisodium phosphate (TSP) dipping treatment on lesion development of fruit inoculated with A. alternata. In vitro test was conducted to investigate the effect of TSP on mycelia growth of A. alternata. The optimal concentration of TSP was screened to assay its effect on the activity of anti-oxidative enzymes, the content of H2O2 and phenylpropane metabolites in apple fruit. The results showed that the different concentrations of TSP significantly inhibited mycelia growth of A. alternata and indicated dose dependent. TSP treatment also inhibited lesion development of apple fruit inoculated with A. alternata. According these results, 0.5 mg/mL TSP was chose for the following study. The results also indicated that TSP treatment enhanced the activity of phenylalanine ammonialyase, peroxidase, catalase, ascorbate peroxidase, superoxide dismutase, glutathione reductase, increased H2O2 accumulation and total phenolic compounds, flavonoids and lignin contents in apple fruit. All these results suggest that enhanced disease resistance in apple fruits by TSP against A. alternata is associated with increasing anti-oxidative enzymes activities and accumulation of phenylpropane metabolites.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAlternaria alternata 3aapples 3aascorbate peroxidase 3acatalase 3adipping 3adisease resistance 3adose response 3aflavonoids 3afruits 3aglutathione-disulfide reductase 3ahydrogen peroxide 3ain vitro studies 3alignin content 3ametabolites 3amycelium 3aperoxidase 3aphenolic compounds 3aphenylalanine ammonia-lyase 3apostharvest diseases 3asodium phosphate 3asuperoxide dismutase 0aMalus domestica 0aTrisodium phosphate 0aInduced resistance 0aAlternaria alternata1 aChen, Yanru1 aLi, Canying1 aWei, Meilin1 aLi, Xue1 aTang, Qi1 aDuan, Bin0 tPhysiological and molecular plant pathology.g2019 Apr., v. 106 p.226-231dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl39032x0885-57657nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.pmpp.2019.03.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03351naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002000139245014000159300001800299520176400317592002802081650002402109650001502133650002102148650001602169650001202185650002402197650000902221650000902230650001102239650002302250650000902273650001202282650002202294650001202316650002402328650001702352650002002369650002102389650001602410653001102426653000902437653002102446653001702467653002402484700002302508700003102531700002002562700002002582773011202602856007402714852000902788655001202797IND60673803520221121185648.0210209e20181101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067380352DNAL7 a10.3382/ps/pey2672doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDewez, Marine F10aUse of computed tomography to determine body composition of heavy strain turkey hens (Meleagris gallopavo) from rearing to early laying  ap. 4093-4106.  aGenetic selection has improved the growth performance of poultry, but also influenced other metabolic parameters and physiological functions such as reproduction. To counter the negative effects of this enhanced development, modifications of the environment or diet are frequently used. As all animals are not equally sensitive and do not respond in the same way, the evolution of the body composition has got to be better characterized with non-invasive tools to reach a higher flock homogeneity and improve production yield. Thus, we have analyzed turkey breeder hens’ body composition using computed tomography scan and measurements of biochemical markers from 16 to 34 wk old. During rearing, body weight was strongly correlated to muscle, fat, and bone volumes (r > 0.75), and increased with hen age until sexual maturity (31 wk). These correlations did not maintain after photostimulation was initiated (29 wk). Muscle volume linear regression with hen age resulted in a R² value of 0.626 over the whole trial study. Bone volume was better fitted by a quadratic regression (R² = 0.7) and was proportional to calcium plasma level evolution, both increasing after 28 wk of age. Conversely, fat volume quadratic regression (R² = 0.5) was symmetrical to triglyceride levels, the first decreasing notably at sexual maturity, the other increasing massively after 28 wk. Egg, yolk, and albumen weights increased with hen age, as did yolk triglyceride levels. In conclusion, computed tomography allows to investigate turkey breeders’ body composition and bring new data in the genetic selection strategy. In addition, the evolution of the fat deposition and bone changes have been monitored over time and could help to optimize breeders’ diet strategy.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMeleagris gallopavo 3abiomarkers 3abody composition 3abody weight 3acalcium 3acomputed tomography 3adiet 3aeggs 3aflocks 3agrowth performance 3ahens 3amuscles 3anatural selection 3arearing 3aregression analysis 3areproduction 3asexual maturity 3atriacylglycerols 3aturkey hens 0aturkey 0ahens 0abody composition 0areproduction 0acomputed tomography1 aEtourneau, Patrice1 aLecompte, F.q(François),1 aBriere, Sylvain1 aFroment, Pascal0 tPoultry science.g2018 Nov. 01, v. 97, no. 11 p.4093-4106dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl45501x0032-57917nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3382/ps/pey2673Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04376naa a2200637 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100001700188245013000205300001100335506007600346520222700422592002802649596005902677596005902736596005902795596006302854596007802917506003702995650003403032650001903066650001603085650001903101650001603120650001403136650003103150650002703181650004203208650001103250650001303261650001703274650001903291650003003310650001303340650001003353650002003363650001603383650001103399651001003410700001603420700001803436700001803454700001103472700001403483700001803497700001703515773010303532856008203635852000903717655001203726IND60592105520221207144147.0190503e201812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059210552DNAL7 a10.1186/s12870-018-1242-42doi7 aPMC58705052pmcid7 a295876482pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZeng, Xiucun10aIdentification of cold stress responsive microRNAs in two winter turnip rape (Brassica rapa L.) by high throughput sequencing  ap. 52.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: Low temperature is a major abiotic stress affecting the production of rapeseed in China by impeding plant growth and development. A comprehensive knowledge of small-RNA expression pattern in Brassica rapa under cold stress could improve our knowledge of microRNA-mediated stress responses. RESULTS: A total of 353 cold-responsive miRNAs, 84 putative novel and 269 conserved miRNAs, were identified from the leaves and roots of two winter turnip rape varieties ‘Longyou 7’ (cold-tolerant) and ‘Tianyou 4’ (cold-sensitive), which were stressed under − 4 °C for 8 h. Eight conserved (miR166h-3p-1, miR398b-3p, miR398b-3p-1, miR408d, miR156a-5p, miR396h, miR845a-1, miR166u) and two novel miRNAs (Bra-novel-miR3153-5p and Bra-novel-miR3172-5p) were differentially expressed in leaves of ‘Longyou 7’ under cold stress. Bra-novel-miR3936-5p was up-regulated in roots of ‘Longyou 7’ under cold stress. Four and five conserved miRNAs were differentially expressed in leaves and roots of ‘Tianyou 4’ after cold stress. Besides, we found two conserved miRNAs (miR319e and miR166m-2) were down-regulated in non-stressed roots of ‘Longyou 7’ compared with ‘Tianyou 4’. After cold stress, we found two and eight miRNAs were differentially expressed in leaves and roots of ‘Longyou 7’ compared with ‘Tianyou 4’. The differentially expressed miRNAs between two cultivars under cold stress include novel miRNAs and the members of the miR166 and miR319 families. A total of 211 target genes for 15 known miRNAs and two novel miRNAs were predicted by bioinformatic analysis, mainly involved in metabolic processes and stress responses. Five differentially expressed miRNAs and predicted target genes were confirmed by quantitative reverse transcription PCR, and the expressional changes of target genes were negatively correlated to differentially expressed miRNAs. Our data indicated that some candidate miRNAs (e.g., miR166e, miR319, and Bra-novel-miR3936-5p) may play important roles in plant response to cold stress. CONCLUSIONS: Our work indicates that miRNA and putative target genes mediated metabolic processes and stress responses are significant to cold tolerance in B. rapa.  aPublisher supplied data  a31560397cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a31460356cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a31660401cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a2015CB150201cNational Key Basic Research Program of China  a1506RJZG051, 145RJZG050cthe Natural Science Foundation of Gansu Province0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aBrassica rapa subsp. oleifera 3abioinformatics 3acold stress 3acold tolerance 3acorrelation 3acultivars 3agene expression regulation 3agrowth and development 3ahigh-throughput nucleotide sequencing 3aleaves 3amicroRNA 3aplant growth 3aplant response 3apolymerase chain reaction 3arapeseed 3aroots 3astress response 3atemperature 3awinter 3aChina1 aXu, Yaozhao1 aJiang, Jinjin1 aZhang, Fenqin1 aMa, Li1 aWu, Dewei1 aWang, Youping1 aSun, Wancang0 tBMC plant biology.g2018 Dec., v. 18, no. 1 p.52-52dBioMed CentralwJournal:2167x1471-22297nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12870-018-1242-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02555naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002600139245011900165300001600284500002000300520118800320592002801508650001701536650002501553650002501578650001601603650001801619650001801637650001601655650001401671650001101685650002001696650000901716650001401725650002001739650000901759650001401768650002001782650001101802650002101813700006101834773012001895856007302015852000902088655001202097IND60629647620221121093441.0190202e201903  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062964762DNAL7 a10.1111/are.139802doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDevi, Arambam Ashwini10aEfficacy and effects of clove oil and MS‐222 on the immune‐biochemical responses of juvenile rohu Labeo rohita  ap. 957-963.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe present study determined the effective concentrations of clove oil and MS‐222 in juvenile rohu Labeo rohita for quick induction and recovery. The immune‐biochemical responses due to 0, 1 and 24 hr exposure to those anaesthetics were also evaluated. Of four concentrations of the anaesthetics examined, the lowest effective concentration of clove oil and MS‐222 were 50 µl/L and 125 mg/L respectively. Clove oil and MS‐222 significantly increased the myeloperoxidase, total protein and alkaline phosphatase activity at some of the holding durations. However, superoxide anion production (after 0 and 1 hr) and antiprotease activity (after 24 hr) were significantly reduced in fish exposed to clove oil. Serum glucose content was significantly elevated in the MS‐222‐treated group. Furthermore, the clove oil‐treated group showed significantly higher levels of serum Na⁺ and K⁺, while the aspartate and alanine aminotransferase activities were significantly enhanced in the MS‐222 group. The use of both clove oil and MS‐222 is advised as an anaesthetic agent for rohu with a bias towards clove oil, considering its economic and operational feasibility.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLabeo rohita 3aalanine transaminase 3aalkaline phosphatase 3aanesthetics 3aaspartic acid 3ablood glucose 3ablood serum 3aclove oil 3acloves 3aenzyme activity 3afish 3ajuveniles 3amyeloperoxidase 3aoils 3apotassium 3aprotein content 3asodium 3asuperoxide anion1 aKamilya, Dibyendu1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6491-59100 tAquaculture research.g2019 Mar., v. 50, no. 3 p.957-963dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl53865x1355-557X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/are.139803Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03051naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245011100168300001800279500001400297520176300311592002802074650000802102650001302110650001502123650001402138650000902152650001302161650001202174650002202186650001602208650002602224650001902250650001402269650001002283650001402293650001302307650001502320650001102335650002402346773014502370856008102515852000902596655001202605IND60684815120221121081204.0200222e202003  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068481512DNAL7 a10.1007/s10668-018-0285-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVinod Kumar, V.,10aInvestigation of the thermal performance of coconut fibre composite with aluminium reflector cooling roofs  ap. 2207-2221.  aNAL-light  aGlobal warming and depletion of petroleum resources have made the scientists to focus on new passive cooling techniques to reduce the indoor temperature of residential and commercial buildings. This paper explores the benefits of using coconut fibre composite as a passive cooling roof and quantifies those benefits in terms of heat flow changes through field experiment and compares them to the base case of standard roof in arid regions. The research also focussed on the usage of this material in combination with radiation reflectors such as aluminium and the effect of air gap between coconut fibre composite and aluminium reflector on the energy efficiency of the buildings. Experimental investigation showed a substantial reduction in room air and concrete roof slab temperature of coconut fibre composite with aluminium reflector room in comparison with the conventional roof. A maximum reduction of 5.99 °C (16.59%) and 8.39 °C (23.8%) were observed in room air and roof slab temperature of coconut fibre composite–aluminium roof with an air gap of 40 cm between them. It was also observed that as the air gap between coconut fibre composite and aluminium reflector is increased, the room air and roof slab temperature were reduced due to enhanced convective cooling. Compared to a standard roof, the indoor air temperature of coconut fibre composite roof was reduced by a maximum of 2.2 °C (5.86%), 2.9 °C and 5.99 °C (16.59%) for 0, 20 and 40 cm air gap between the coconut fibre composite and aluminium reflector, respectively. It is convincingly demonstrated that the coconut fibre composite roof with aluminium reflector can significantly affect the indoor air and roof surface temperature of the roofs during the hot summer days.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3aaluminum 3aarid zones 3abuildings 3acoir 3aconcrete 3acooling 3aenergy efficiency 3aenvironment 3afield experimentation 3aglobal warming 3aheat flow 3apaper 3apetroleum 3aresearch 3ascientists 3asummer 3asurface temperature0 tEnvironment, development and sustainability.g2020 Mar., v. 22, no. 3 p.2207-2221dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl3870050x1387-585X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10668-018-0285-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02320naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006500148245010700213300001100320520136500331592002801696650001401724650001601738650001401754650001501768700006301783773010401846856008301950852000902033655001202042IND60736608820221122221238.0210707e202106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073660882DNAL7 a10.1007/s13157-021-01400-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAshby✉, Mark Andrew1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8291-749012aA Critical Review of the IUCN UK Peatland Programme’s “Burning and Peatlands” Position Statement  ap. 56.  aDespite substantial contrary evidence, there has been a growing tendency to present prescribed vegetation burning as a management practice that is always damaging to peatland ecosystems in the UK. This is exemplified by the “Burning and Peatlands” position statement published by the International Union for Conservation of Nature UK Peatland Programme. Indeed, while we strongly agree with several of the statements made within this position statement, it also contains a series of unverified assertions and misleading arguments that seemingly serve to simplify the narrative and paint prescribed burning as a wholly damaging peatland management tool. Given that this position statement is published by one of the UK’s most prominent peatland conservation organisations, it is likely to be consulted when debating upland land use policy. Therefore, for the benefit of policymakers, we provide a point-by-point critical review of the “Burning and Peatlands” position statement. We also discuss several further points for researchers and policymakers to consider that are consistently ignored by those attempting to simplify the narrative about prescribed burning. Our aim in producing this discussion paper is to encourage the research and policy community to move towards an evidence-based position about prescribed burning impacts on UK peatlands.  aPublisher supplied data 3ahighlands 3aland policy 3apeatlands 3avegetation1 aHeinemeyer, Andreas1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3151-24660 tWetlands.g2021 June, v. 41, no. 5 p.56-56dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl57834x0277-52127nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13157-021-01400-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02119naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002400146245005900170300001800229520124800247592002801495653001601523653001001539653001801549653002201567653000901589700002501598773011501623856008201738852000901820655001201829IND60128687820221118045524.0151116e200710  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012868782DNAL7 a10.1644/06-MAMM-A-296R.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLaundréé, John W.10aDo Female Pumas (Puma concolor) Exhibit a Birth Pulse?  ap. 1300-1304.  aFemale pumas (Puma concolor) give birth in all months of the year with a possible birth pulse in July––September. This pulse is proposed to be timed to provide increased survival probabilities to young born during these months. We tested data on birth dates from 8 different studies for a birth pulse. We also compared survival rates for young born in July––September to those for young born outside of these dates during a 17-year study in Idaho and Utah. The distribution of litters born per month was not uniform, with 41%% of births occurring in July––September. Survival rates of young born in July––September were equal to those in other months of the year (0.774 ±± 0.006 versus 0.779 ±± 0.004). We conclude that there was a propensity for higher numbers of litters to be born in July––September. However, we rejected the hypothesis that young born in July––September had greater survival than young born at other times of the year. We suggest that rather than there being a survival advantage to pumas born in July––September, perhaps there is a survival disadvantage to those born in January––February (4.5%% of 484 litters). However, there were insufficient data to test this alternate hypothesis.  aPublisher supplied data 0abirth pulse 0aIdaho 0aPuma concolor 0asurvival of young 0aUtah1 aHernáández, Lucina0 tJournal of mammalogy.g2007 Oct., v. 88, no. 5 p.1300-1304dAmerican Society of Mammalogists.x1545-15427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1644%2F06-MAMM-A-296R.13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03725naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001700094024002300111024002800134024002300162024004000185024002500225040001800250100005500268245006500323300001600388500002000404520156400424592002801988650002202016650002602038650002602064650003002090650001402120650001602134650002502150650001302175650001202188650001302200650001702213650001102230650001602241650001702257650001702274700001402291700003102305700005402336700005702390700005702447700002402504700001702528700001502545700005502560700005702615700001602672700006202688773012602750856011402876856007502990961001303065852000903078655001203087IND60770934920221214225851.0220820e202101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077093492DNAL7 a3717252aris7 a10113/77093492hdl7 a10.1002/plr2.201182doi7 a3717252seq_no_1157 a2090-43440-007-00D2aris_project_no7 a4288002aris_accn_no  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGill, K.

CV‐1176, PI 686413; PVP 201800104) is a soft white common winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) cultivar carrying two‐gene tolerance to imazamox herbicide that was developed and released in October 2016 by the Agricultural Research Center of Washington State University. It was tested under the experimental designations KCF9002 and WA 8187. Resilience CL+ was developed using marker‐assisted background selection and marker‐assisted forward breeding approaches involving a cross between a soft white winter wheat cultivar ‘Madsen’ and CL0618 (an Australian hard red spring two‐gene Clearfield line). Resilience CL+ carries two mutation alleles (Als1 and Als2) of the acetolactate synthase gene (ALS) located on chromosomes 6DL and 6BL. Resilience CL+ has high grain‐yield potential, intermediate plant height, and is well adapted to regions of the inland Pacific Northwest (PNW) with >500 mm of annual precipitation. Resilience CL+ exhibited herbicide tolerance equivalent to ‘AP503 CL2’ and greater than the single‐gene Clearfield cultivar ‘ORCF‐102’. Compared with the other Clearfield cultivars grown in the PNW, Resilience CL+ has a high level of resistance to stripe rust and foot rot resistance, similar to that of Madsen. Resilience CL+ has soft kernels, an excellent milling score, and good end‐use quality characteristics. Yield comparison of Resilience CL+ with other popular cultivars demonstrated that it has greater yield than ‘SY Ovation’ and Madsen but is similar to ORCF‐102.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTriticum aestivum 3aacetolactate synthase 3aagricultural research 3aatmospheric precipitation 3acultivars 3agrain yield 3aherbicide resistance 3aimazamox 3amutants 3amutation 3aplant height 3aspring 3astripe rust 3auniversities 3awinter wheat1 aKumar, N.1 aRandhāwā, Aicca.

Results revealed that, no significant difference was observed in the protein and ash content between control (chickpea basede sattu mix) and T1. However, significant difference was observed between the control and T2 sample between moisture, fat, insoluble and total fiber, with the exception of protein, soluble fiber and ash. In case of T1 and T2, significant difference was observed in fat and total fiber content. Coming on to the mineral composition, significant difference was observed between the mineral content in control and T1, with respect to calcium, potassium, sodium, magnesium, iron, manganese and copper. In case of control and T2, significant difference was observed with respect to calcium, potassium, sodium, magnesium, iron and copper, with the exception of manganese. Coming on to the mineral content of both the formulations, significant difference was observed with respect to all the minerals estimated. Significant difference was observed in the total amylose content between control and formulated samples on 0, 30 and 60 days. Microstructural studies of raw and roasted sattu and its ingredients by observation under scanning electron microscope revealed that substantial structural changes occurred during processing. The raw grains were tightly packed and contained no air spaces. However, a large number of air spaces are formed in the cotyledon of the roasted grain sample. It was observed that, T1and T2 had medium GI value (56 and 58% respectively), Whereas for control it was 60%. The formulated samples were found to be shelf stable for 60 days at RT, with an increase in moisture content of 4–6%. All the samples were sensorial acceptable and there was no perceptible off odor or off taste.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3aamylose 3aash content 3abarley 3acalcium 3achickpeas 3acopper 3acorn 3acotyledons 3afood science 3airon 3amagnesium 3amanganese 3amineral content 3aodors 3apotassium 3asodium 3asoluble fiber 3ataste 3atechnology 3awater content 3awheat1 aDharanya, E.

We hypothesized that Pinus densiflora Sieb. et Zucc. (PSZ) can protect against NAFLD by regulating lipid accumulation and oxidative stress in the liver. To investigate the effect of PSZ upon NAFLD, we used an established cellular model: HepG2 cells treated with oleic acid. Then, the extent of hepatic steatosis and oxidative stress was assessed and levels of inflammatory markers measured. Oleic acid-treated HepG2 cells, compared with controls, had greater lipid accumulation. PSZ decreased lipid accumulation by 63% in oleic acid-treated HepG2 cells. Additionally, PSZ decreased the target gene expression of lipogenesis such as sterol regulatory element binding protein-1c, fatty acid synthase, stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1, diacylglycerol O-acyltransferase-1, and acetyl-CoA carboxylase-1 by 1.75, 6.0, 2.32, 1.93 and 1.81 fold, respectively. In addition, Oleic acid-treated HepG2 cells elicited extensive accumulation of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNFα) by 4.53 fold, whereas PSZ-treated cells decreased the expression of TNFα mRNA by 1.76 fold. PSZ significantly inhibited oxidative stress induced by reactive oxygen species. These results suggest that PSZ has effects on steatosis in vitro and further studies are needed in vivo to verify the current observations.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aPinus densiflora 3aacetyl coenzyme A 3adiacylglycerols 3afatty liver 3afatty-acid synthase 3agene expression 3ahuman cell lines 3alipogenesis 3aliver 3amessenger RNA 3amodels 3aoleic acid 3aoxidative stress 3areactive oxygen species 3astearoyl-CoA desaturase 3asterols 3atumor necrosis factor-alpha1 aWi, Hae-Ri1 aKim, Haeng-Ran1 aPark, Kye Won1 aHwang, Kyung-A0 tNutrients.g2014 July 23, v. 6, no. 7 p.2956-2972dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2271x2072-66437nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/nu60729563Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02364naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002400150245008300174300001800257520107200275592002801347650001101375650001501386650001401401650001701415650002601432650002301458650000901481650000901490650002101499650004401520650001901564650001301583650001801596650001401614700002301628700002001651700005701671773012101728856008401849852000901933655001201942IND60672034620221116144525.0191008e20190916xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067203462DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.macromol.9b016092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMcNelles, Stuart A.10aStrain-Promoted Azide-Alkyne Cycloaddition-Mediated Step-Growth Polymerization  ap. 7183-7187.  aThe development of new polymerization techniques enables the preparation of new polymers with unique functionalities, structures, and architectures. Here, we report a bifunctional monomer based on the strained dibenzoazacyclooctyne (DBCO) structure that efficiently polymerizes with several bifunctional azide comonomers. The reactions proceed to full conversion in under 5 min and routinely results in polymers with molecular weights above 50 kDa, as determined by size-exclusion chromatography and ¹H NMR. The polymers were found to retain reactive chain ends, enabling control of molecular weight via monomer addition or titration of monomer stoichiometry. The DBCO-based monomer was further investigated in the synthesis of cross-linked polymers using a trifunctional azide cross-linker, which formed gels at concentrations in excess of 50 mM, as suppression of intramolecular cyclization was necessary. This strategy allows for the rapid and efficient preparation of polymers and cross-linked gels without heat, light, catalysts, initiators, or any by-products.  aPublisher supplied data 3aazides 3abyproducts 3acatalysts 3acrosslinking 3acyclization reactions 3agel chromatography 3agels 3aheat 3amolecular weight 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3apolymerization 3apolymers 3astoichiometry 3atitration1 aPantaleo, Julia L.1 aMeichsner, Eric1 aAdronov, Alex1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0770-31180 tMacromolecules.g2019 Sept. 16, v. 52, no. 19 p.7183-7187dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23616x1520-58357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.macromol.9b016093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03440naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001900148245012700167300001200294500001900306520172200325592002802047596008902075596008902164650001702253650001402270650002802284650001402312650001902326650002402345650001802369650001702387650001702404650001102421650001102432650001902443650001502462650001202477650001902489650001602508650001702524700002002541700002002561700002002581700001702601700001802618700006502636773011702701856008302818852000902901655001202910IND60736609020221122181152.0210615e202106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073660902DNAL7 a10.1007/s13205-021-02812-w2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKumar, Prateek10aIn vitro and in silico anticancer potential analysis of Streptomyces sp. extract against human lung cancer cell line, A549  ap. 254.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aDuring our previous investigation, bioactive compounds present in the extract of Streptomyces sp. strain 196 were characterized using LC–MS/MS and ¹H NMR studies. These compounds were K-252-C aglycone indolocarbazole alkaloid, decoyinine, and cycloheximide; the study of these natural drugs against lung carcinoma is still limited. Focus of the current investigation was to study the anticancer effect of strain 196 extract on lung cancer cells (A549). During in vitro studies, anti-proliferative effect of extract was studied using MTT assay in A549 cells. Effect of extract on cell survival was further evaluated using colony assay. Cell death was qualitatively assessed using apoptosis assay. The aftereffect of extract treatment on metastatic potential of cancerous cells was studied using wound closure assay. Effect of extract on the morphology and cytoskeletal arrangement of A549 cells was studied using phalloidin staining. The extract demonstrated concentration and time-dependent cytotoxicity with IC₅₀ value at 0.5 mg/ml (6 h) and 0.15 mg/ml (24 h). The proliferation and metastatic potential of cells, as characterized by MTT and migration assay, decreased over time in a concentration-dependent manner. Discrete changes in cellular morphology were noted as a result of the induced cytotoxicity. Apoptosis assay demonstrated 98.7% cell death at highest concentration of extract (1 mg/ml). During in silico studies, molecular docking revealed that strain 196 compounds are efficiently binding to mutant EGFR form (T790M/L858R) with release of binding energy (∆G) between − 5 and − 6.9 kcal/Mol. In conclusion, strain 196 extract could be a source of therapeutic drugs to treat lung carcinoma.  aPublisher supplied data  a08/529(0007)/2017-EMR-IcCouncil of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR), India  a08/529(0005)/2017-EMR-IcCouncil of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR), India 3aStreptomyces 3aalkaloids 3aantineoplastic activity 3aapoptosis 3acell viability 3acomputer simulation 3acycloheximide 3acytoskeleton 3acytotoxicity 3aenergy 3ahumans 3alung neoplasms 3ametastasis 3amutants 3aneoplasm cells 3aphalloidine 3atherapeutics1 aChauhan, Anjali1 aKumar, Munendra1 aKuanr, Bijoy K.1 aKundu, Aditi1 aSolanki, Renu1 aKapur, Monisha Khanna1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1797-71980 t3 Biotech.g2021 June, v. 11, no. 6 p.254-254dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:22884x2190-572X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13205-021-02812-w3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04351naa a2200673 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094024002200121024001900143040001800162100002800180245021500208300001800423506007600441520215400517592002802671506003702699650002602736650003102762650003102793650001902824650003302843650001402876650001102890650002502901650001702926650002602943650001602969650001502985650002403000650001103024650001203035650003103047650003103078650002103109650002303130650001303153650001303166650002003179650001303199650003103212650002503243650001703268650000903285650001503294650001003309651001303319700002103332700002203353700002203375700002703397700002603424773013303450856007303583852000903656655001203665IND60649900220221207084622.0190707e20140723xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064990022DNAL7 a10.3390/nu60729732doi7 aPMC41137732pmcid7 a250571052pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWinter, Frank Stéphane14aThe Effect of Arthrospira platensis Capsules on CD4 T-Cells and Antioxidative Capacity in a Randomized Pilot Study of Adult Women Infected with Human Immunodeficiency Virus Not under HAART in Yaoundé, Cameroon  ap. 2973-2986.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aDietary supplements are often used to improve the nutritional status of people living with HIV/AIDS (PLHIV). Arthrospira platensis (Asp), also known as Spirulina, is a cyanobacterium rich in proteins and micronutrients. Cell and animal trials described immune-modulating, antiretroviral and antioxidant activities. This pilot study describes the effects of the supplementation of 5 g/day of Asp on a pre-highly-active antiretroviral therapy (pre-HAART), HIV-infected, adult female population. It was conducted as a three-month randomized controlled trial (RCT) that compared a cup supplementation of five grams/day of Asp with a placebo of equal protein content and energy. The study included 73 HIV-infected women. The immediate outcome variables were CD4 T-cells, viral load and immune activation by CD8 T-cells expressing CD38. The antioxidant status was assessed by way of the total antioxidant capacity of the serum (TAOS). The renal function was documented by way of creatinine, urea and the calculated glomerular filtration rate. Statistical analyses were carried out with non-parametric tests, and the effect size of each interaction was calculated. No differences in the immunological and virological markers between the Asp and the placebo group could be observed. In the placebo group, 21 of 30 patients (70%) developed concomitant events, while in the Asp group, only 12 of 28 patients (43%) did. Both groups registered a significant weight increase; 0.5 kg (p < 0.05) in the Asp group and 0.65 kg (p < 0.05) in the placebo group. The antioxidant capacity increase of 56 (1–98) µM for Asp was significantly different from the decrease observed in the placebo group (p < 0.001). A slight increase in the creatinine level of 0.1 g/dL (p < 0.001) was observed in the Asp group, and no effect was observed in the urea levels. The improvement of the antioxidant capacity under Asp, shown for the first time on PLHIV, could become a focus for future research on the nutritional and health effects of Spirulina. The observed slight, but significant increase of serum creatinine needs further evaluation, especially with varying doses of Asp.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aArthrospira platensis 3aCD4-positive T-lymphocytes 3aCD8-positive T-lymphocytes 3aHIV infections 3aHuman immunodeficiency virus 3aSpirulina 3aadults 3aantioxidant activity 3aantioxidants 3aantiretroviral agents 3ablood serum 3acreatinine 3adietary supplements 3aenergy 3afemales 3aglomerular filtration rate 3ahealth effects assessments 3aimmunomodulators 3anutritional status 3apatients 3aplacebos 3aprotein content 3aproteins 3arandomized clinical trials 3astatistical analysis 3atherapeutics 3aurea 3aviral load 3awomen 3aCameroon1 aEmakam, Francois1 aKfutwah, Anfumbom1 aHermann, Johannes1 aAzabji-Kenfack, Marcel1 aKrawinkel, Michael B.0 tNutrients.g2014 July 23, v. 6, no. 7 p.2973-2986dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2271x2072-66437nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/nu60729733Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02182naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100005500150245010500205300001800310520098000328592002801308650001101336650001201347650001401359650001601373650004901389650001701438650001901455650001301474650003401487650001101521650001501532700005901547773012101606856008401727852000901811655001201820IND60672034720200108000000.0191008e20190917xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067203472DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.macromol.9b016112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLappan, Uwe1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7464-944910aPolyanion Substitution in Polyelectrolyte Complex Dispersions Studied by Spin-Label EPR Spectroscopy  ap. 7218-7223.  aA new method for the study of the substitution of polyelectrolytes in polyelectrolyte complexes is demonstrated. A spin-labeled weak polyanion poly(ethylene-alt-maleic acid) (P(E-alt-MA)) has been used to study the substitution of this polyanion in the polyelectrolyte complex with the strong polycation poly(diallyldimethylammonium chloride) (PDADMAC) by the strong polyanion poly(sodium styrenesulfonate) (PSSNa). The study has shown that the substitution of the polyanion can be closely monitored by spin-label EPR spectroscopy. The substitution proceeded over a period of hours. Increasing the ionic strength, the rate of the substitution reaction has been accelerated. The presented method offers more freedom in the choice of the polymers investigated compared to the method of fluorescence quenching, which has been also applied to monitor exchange and substitution reactions, because the oppositely charged polyelectrolyte does not have to be a fluorescence quencher.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanions 3acations 3achlorides 3adispersions 3aelectron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy 3afluorescence 3aionic strength 3apolymers 3aquaternary ammonium compounds 3asodium 3asulfonates1 aScheler, Ulrich1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4714-316X0 tMacromolecules.g2019 Sept. 17, v. 52, no. 19 p.7218-7223dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23616x1520-58357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.macromol.9b016113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02767naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100003200147245008800179300001800267500001400285520128200299592002801581650001301609650002501622650002601647650001201673650001601685650001401701650001401715650001901729650001101748650002601759650002301785650001401808650001301822650001301835650001301848650001201861650001601873650001301889650001101902650001701913700001701930700002001947700002601967700002101993773014502014856008102159852000902240655001202249IND60684815520221121061607.0200222e202003  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068481552DNAL7 a10.1007/s10668-018-0286-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChouhan, Harshwardhan Singh10aInvestigating use of dimensional limestone slurry waste as fine aggregate in mortar  ap. 2223-2245.  aNAL-light  aIn recent years, construction industry has seen huge demand for non-renewable materials such as stones, fine aggregate, coarse aggregate, etc., resulting in exponential growth in mining operation. In parallel to this, the quarrying of dimensional stone generates vast amount of waste in both solid and powder forms. Sustainable disposal of these wastes has emerged as a big challenge around the globe. The present research focusses on minimizing the environmental pollution which is often due to unplanned disposal of slurry waste generated during the cutting process. To carry out this study, eleven mortar mixes were prepared with dimension limestone slurry waste as a replacement of fine aggregate. These mixes were tested for their workability, porosity, ultrasonic pulse velocity, dynamic modulus of elasticity, water absorption, compressive strength, flexural strength and adhesive strength. The behavior of internal structure of mortar matrix was evaluated on selected mixes by TGA, FTIR, SEM and MIP techniques. Tests results revealed that up to 40 percent replacement of fine aggregate with dimensional limestone slurry improved strength and sustained necessary rheological parameters of mortar mixes. Results of microstructure studies substantiate these improvements.  aPublisher supplied data 3abehavior 3acompression strength 3aconstruction industry 3acutting 3aenvironment 3alimestone 3amaterials 3amicrostructure 3amining 3amodulus of elasticity 3amodulus of rupture 3apollution 3aporosity 3aresearch 3aslurries 3atesting 3aultrasonics 3avelocity 3awastes 3awater uptake1 aKalla, Pawan1 aNagar, Ravindra1 aGautam, Pradeep Kumar1 aArora, Amar Nath0 tEnvironment, development and sustainability.g2020 Mar., v. 22, no. 3 p.2223-2245dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl3870050x1387-585X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10668-018-0286-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02657naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005800148245011600206300001200322500001900334520135100353592002801704650001601732650004201748650002601790650002101816650002201837650001101859650003501870650001301905650001701918650001501935650001201950651001301962700002701975700001602002700002002018773011702038856008302155852000902238655001202247IND60736609220221122181207.0210615e202106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073660922DNAL7 a10.1007/s13205-021-02816-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAkhtar, Sohail1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5389-279210aAmplicon-based RNAi construct targeting beta-C1 gene gives enhanced resistance against cotton leaf curl disease  ap. 256.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aCotton leaf curl disease (CLCuD) is one of the major limiting factors affecting cotton production in Pakistan for the last three decades. The disease is caused by begomoviruses of the family Geminiviridae. RNA interference (RNAi) is a promising tool that has been proved effective against several pathogens. Using RNAi, different genomic regions of geminiviruses have been targeted to attain sustainable resistance. However, the silencing of the transgene upon virus infection is a limiting factor. Here, we have developed for the first time an amplicon-based RNAi construct to target βC1 gene of betasatellite associated with cotton leaf curl begomoviruses. In addition to producing short interfering (si) RNAs, Rep-based activation or looping out of the construct induced upon virus infection produces multiple copies of transgene that results in accumulation of defective molecules of betasatellite. Subsequent transcription gives rise to increased number of siRNAs that gives enhanced resistance. Transgenic Nicotiana benthamiana plants having RCβ (RNAi construct for betasatellite) were challenged against Cotton leaf curl Khokran virus (CLCuKV) and Cotton leaf curl Multan betasatellite (CLCuMB). Reduced titer of the virus and betasatellite were detected through Southern blot hybridization.

The PEO side chains can work as sensational conductors for lithium salt. Moreover, these macromolecules own lithium cations linked on the backbone, which can facilitate the transport of Li ions and thus improve the lithium-ion transference number. The prepared SPE exhibits a considerable ion conductivity of 4.49 × 10–⁵ S cm–¹ at 30 °C owing to its specific structure. Furthermore, the high capacity and excellent cycle performance demonstrate the foreseeable application of the obtained electrolyte in the lithium-ion battery.  aPublisher supplied data 3acations 3alithium 3alithium batteries 3apolyethylene glycol 3apolymerization1 aJiang, Ke1 aWang, Jirong1 aZuo, Cai1 aJo, Ye Hyang1 aHe, Dan1 aXie, Xiaolin1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5097-74161 aXue, Zhigang1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2335-95370 tMacromolecules.g2019 Sept. 18, v. 52, no. 19 p.7234-7243dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23616x1520-58357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.macromol.9b016413Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03729naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006000148245012600208300001800334520180000352592002802152650002102180650001802201650002402219650001302243650001202256650002302268650001802291650001702309650001302326650001502339650001702354650001802371650002002389653002502409653001402434653001902448653002702467653001602494653003002510700002102540700005902561700006202620700002402682700002202706700006002728700006202788700002002850700002502870700006502895773011102960856008303071852000903154655001203163IND60732807220221118030248.0211030e202105  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073280722DNAL7 a10.1016/j.clnu.2021.03.0292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAmadieu, Camille1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3359-931510aDietary fiber deficiency as a component of malnutrition associated with psychological alterations in alcohol use disorder  ap. 2673-2682.  aChronic alcohol consumption can cause malnutrition that may contribute to alcohol-induced organ injury and psychological disorders. We evaluated the link between nutrient intake, especially dietary fibers (DF) and different parameters reflecting mental health and well being, namely anxiety, depression, alcohol craving, sociability, fatigue and intestinal comfort in alcohol use disorder (AUD) patients.Cross-sectional data from 50 AUD patients, hospitalized for a 3-week detoxification program were used. Three 24-h recalls allowed to calculate dietary habits and nutrient intakes, that was also assessed in healthy subjects (HS). Diet quality was measured using the NOVA score. Psychological factors and intestinal discomfort were evaluated using validated self-administered questionnaires.Energy intake (excluding alcoholic beverage), total fat, monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fatty acids, protein and DF intakes were lower in AUD subjects compared to HS. Ninety percent of patients had a DF intake below the recommendation. AUD patients consumed more than twice as much ultra-processed food than HS. Fructan intake was negatively associated with anxiety (p = 0.04) adjusted for main confounders. Total DF, insoluble, soluble DF and galacto-oligosaccharide intakes were associated with higher sociability score. Soluble DF intake was associated with better satisfaction of bowel function (p = 0.02) and a lower intestinal discomfort (p = 0.04).This study reveals that insufficient DF intake is part of AUD-related malnutrition syndrome, and is associated with higher anxiety, lower sociability score and intestinal discomfort. Our results suggest that an adequate intake of DF might be beneficial for recovery from AUD.NCT03803709, https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03803709.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAdequate Intakes 3aalcohol abuse 3aalcoholic beverages 3aalcohols 3aanxiety 3aclinical nutrition 3adietary fiber 3afood quality 3afructans 3aintestines 3amalnutrition 3amental health 3anutrient intake 0aAlcohol use disorder 0aNutrition 0aDietary fibers 0aPsychological symptoms 0aSociability 0aGastrointestinal symptoms1 aLeclercq, Sophie1 aCoste, Valentin1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2666-66631 aThijssen, Victoria1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1196-06671 aNeyrinck, Audrey M.1 aBindels, Laure B.1 aCani, Patrice D.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2040-24481 aPiessevaux, Hubert1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1193-06011 aStärkel, Peter1 aTimary, Philippe de,1 aDelzenne, Nathalie M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2115-60820 tClinical nutrition.g2021 May, v. 40, no. 5 p.2673-2682dElsevier LtdwJournal:J000000059x0261-56147nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.clnu.2021.03.0293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02203naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100005900150245014000209300001600349520083500365592002801200650001101228650001201239650001501251650001401266650001001280650001301290650001101303650001801314650001901332650001501351650000901366653003101375653001501406653001701421653001401438653001401452653001801466700001801484700003701502700002001539773009301559856008401652852000901736655001201745IND60561885820221119161153.0170720e201510  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056188582DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fuproc.2015.07.0142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlipour, Yousef1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0184-760114aThe effect of co-firing sewage sludge with used wood on the corrosion of an FeCrAl alloy and a nickel-based alloy in the furnace region  ap. 805-813.  aThe effect of digested sewage sludge as a fuel additive to reduce corrosion of furnace walls has been studied. The nickel base alloy Alloy 625 and the iron–chromium–aluminium alloy Kanthal APMT™ were exposed for 14.25h at the furnace wall in a power boiler burning 100% used (also known as waste or recycled) wood. The test was then repeated with the addition of sewage sludge to the waste wood. The samples were chemically analysed and thermodynamically modelled and the corrosion mechanisms were investigated. The results showed that the co-firing of sewage sludge with recycled wood leads to a reduction in the corrosion. Attack by a potassium–lead combination appeared to be the main corrosion mechanism in Alloy 625 during waste wood combustion, while attack by alkali chloride was found to be dominant in APMT alloy.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalloys 3aburning 3acombustion 3acorrosion 3afuels 3afurnaces 3anickel 3asewage sludge 3athermodynamics 3awaste wood 3awood 0aHigh temperature corrosion 0aWaterwalls 0aKanthal APMT 0aAlloy 625 0aUsed wood 0aSewage sludge1 aTalus, Annika1 aHenderson, P.

In this study, we investigated the effects of choline (5, 35 and 70 μM) on DNA methylation modifications, mRNA expression of the critical genes and their enzyme activities involved in hepatic lipid metabolism, mitochondrial membrane potential (Δψm) and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) in C3A cells exposed to excessive energy substrates (lactate, 10 mM; octanoate, 2 mM and pyruvate, 1 mM; lactate, octanoate and pyruvate-supplemented medium (LOP)). Thirty five micromole or 70 μM choline alone, instead of a low dose (5 μM), reduced hepatocellular triglyceride (TG) accumulation, protected Δψm from decrement and increased GSH-Px activity in C3A cells. The increment of TG accumulation, reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and Δψm disruption were observed under LOP treatment in C3A cells after 72 h of culture, which were counteracted by concomitant treatment of choline (35 μM or 70 μM) partially via reversing the methylation status of the peroxisomal proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARα) gene promoter, upregulating PPARα, carnitine palmitoyl transferase-I (CPT-I) and downregulating fatty acid synthase (FAS) gene expression, as well as decreasing FAS activity and increasing CPT-I and GSH-Px activities. These findings provided a novel insight into the lipotropic role of choline as a vital methyl-donor in the intervention of chronic metabolic diseases.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDNA methylation 3acarnitine 3acholine 3aenergy 3aenzyme activity 3afatty-acid synthase 3agene expression 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3aglutathione peroxidase 3ahumans 3alactic acid 3alipid metabolism 3amembrane potential 3ametabolic diseases 3amitochondria 3amitochondrial membrane 3aoctanoic acid 3aperoxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha 3apyruvic acid 3areactive oxygen species 3atriacylglycerols1 aWu, Yang1 aTang, Qingya1 aLeng, Yan1 aCai, Wei0 tNutrients.g2014 July 09, v. 6, no. 7 p.2552-2571dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2271x2072-66437nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/nu60725523Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02812naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245014200168520101700310592002801327650003101355650001601386650001001402650001601412650001701428650003001445650001201475650002401487650001001511650001401521650001701535650002001552653001401572653001701586653002601603653002301629653000801652653002301660700001401683700001101697700001901708700001801727700001501745700002301760700001901783700001901802700002001821700001701841700001801858700001301876700001601889700001701905700001201922700005501934773011401989856008602103852000902189655001202198IND60725969820221116154638.0210918e20210705xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072596982DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhazmat.2021.1252392doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXia, Daiyang10aMelatonin alleviates Ochratoxin A-induced liver inflammation involved intestinal microbiota homeostasis and microbiota-independent manner  aMelatonin (MEL) shows an anti-inflammatory effect and regulates intestinal microbiota communities in animals and humans; Ochratoxin A (OTA) induces liver inflammation through intestinal microbiota. However, it remains to know whether MEL alleviates the liver inflammation induced by OTA. In this study, MEL reversed various adverse effects induced by OTA. MEL recovered the swarming and motility of intestinal microbiota, decreased the accumulation of lipopolysaccharide (LPS), enhanced the tight junction proteins of jejunum and cecum segments; ultimately alleviated OTA-induced liver inflammation in ducks. However, it is worth noting that MEL still had positive effects on the OTA-exposed ducks after antibiotic treatment. These results suggest that both the maintenance of intestinal microbiota homeostasis and intestinal microbiota-independent manner involved the MEL anti-inflammatory function in OTA-induced liver inflammation.

In this paper, single diode photovoltaic (PV) system and double/bypass diode based PV system are designed in MATLAB/Simulink environment based on their mathematical modeling and are validated with a commercially available solar panel. The novelty of the paper is to include the effect of climatic conditions i.e. variable irradiation level, wind speed, temperature, humidity level and dust accumulation in the modeling of both the PV systems to represent a realistic PV system. The comprehensive investigations are made on both the modeled PV systems. The obtained results show the satisfactory performance for realistic models of the PV system. Furthermore, an in depth comparative analysis is carried out for both PV systems.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclimatic factors 3adust 3aelectric power 3ahumidity 3airradiation 3amathematical models 3apower generation 3asolar collectors 3asolar energy 3atemperature 3awind speed 0aSolar PV system 0aDouble diode PV system 0aClimatic conditions 0aGreen energy1 aChauhan, Yogesh K.0 tEnergy.g2016 Dec. 01, v. 116 p.716-734dElsevier LtdwJournal:12436x0360-54427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2016.10.0143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02283naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001300151245009400164300001800258500001400276520103600290592002801326650001701354650001801371650001401389650001101403650002301414650000901437650001001446650002601456650001401482653001801496653001601514653002101530700001801551700002201569700001601591700002101607773013901628856008501767852000901852655001201861IND60692811220221119234515.0200503e20171003xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069281122DNAL7 a10.1080/09168451.2017.13646202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMeng, Qi10aKey compounds contributing to the fruity aroma characterization in Japanese raw soy sauce  ap. 1984-1989.  aNAL-light  aIn order to clarify the aroma characteristics of raw soy sauce (RS), the application of gas chromatography−olfactometry analysis to the aroma concentrate from a RS revealed 76 aroma peaks, of which 25 peaks showed fruit-like aromas. Furthermore, the head space aromatic compounds of RS were analyzed with 32 peaks detected. Ethyl 2-methylpropanoate, ethyl butanoate, ethyl 2-methylbutanoate, ethyl 3-methylbutanoate, and ethyl 4-methylpentanoate were detected with higher flavor dilution factor (FD factor) than other aroma compounds by aroma extract dilution analysis. Quantitative analysis suggested that these compounds were common in all RS samples tested in this study, and were present at higher concentrations than their perception thresholds. The concentrations and the FD factors of these compounds were significantly decreased during the heating of the RS. Fruitiness is one of the key aroma characteristics of RS and the ethyl esters identified in this study are the key components contributing to this distinct aroma.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiochemistry 3abiotechnology 3abutyrates 3aflavor 3aheadspace analysis 3aheat 3aodors 3aquantitative analysis 3asoy sauce 0araw soy sauce 0aethyl ester 0afruit-like aroma1 aImamura, Miho1 aKatayama, Hiroshi1 aObata, Akio1 aSugawara, Etsuko0 tBioscience, biotechnology, and biochemistry.g2017 Oct. 3, v. 81, no. 10 p.1984-1989dTaylor & FranciswJournal:18959x1347-69477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09168451.2017.13646203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03309naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001700094024002300111024002800134024002300162024004000185024002500225040001800250100005900268245009200327300001600419500002000435520164700455592002802102596003702130650001302167650001302180650001502193650002802208650000902236650002302245650002202268650001202290650002102302650002102323650002602344700005602370700001702426700002002443700001802463773011202481856011402593856007402707961001302781852000902794655001202803IND60770936920221214223521.0220805e202101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077093692DNAL7 a3738012aris7 a10113/77093692hdl7 a10.1002/csc2.203302doi7 a3738012seq_no_1157 a6064-21000-015-00D2aris_project_no7 a4343752aris_accn_no  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWilliams, J.

This research was conducted to determine if interactions among cultural practices influence aflatoxin accumulation on inoculated and naturally infested corn. Season‐long irrigation thresholds (full irrigation at −50 kPa vs. deficit irrigation at −125 kPa), planting date (late March vs. late April), and hybrid selection (conventional short‐season, drought‐tolerant full‐season, or conventional full‐season) were evaluated for their influence on aflatoxin accumulation. Experiments were conducted on a Marietta fine sandy loam and a Leeper silty clay loam near Starkville and Verona, MS, in 2016 and 2017, respectively. Needle‐inoculated and noninoculated ears were harvested from each plot. Noninoculated samples indicated that year (p = .0013) and planting date × hybrid type interaction (p = .0263) affected aflatoxin accumulation. The first year of the study produced greater average aflatoxin levels than the second year due to hotter and drier growing conditions for noninoculated samples. Pooled over years, planting later only affected conventional short‐season hybrids, increasing aflatoxin levels by 77% in naturally infested corn. Inoculated samples were affected by a year × planting date interaction (p = .0044) and a planting date × hybrid type interaction (p = .0032). Planting in March 2016 increased aflatoxin more than threefold compared with planting in April, whereas there was no difference between planting date in 2017. Overall, year, planting date, and hybrid type affected aflatoxin levels.  aPublisher supplied data  cMississippi Corn Promotion Board 3aMarietta 3aZea mays 3aaflatoxins 3aanimal and human health 3acorn 3adeficit irrigation 3adrought tolerance 3ahybrids 3airrigation rates 3asandy loam soils 3asilty clay loam soils1 aHenry, W.

In this way, both N-linked and O-linked sites of glycosylation can each be directly identified, characterized, and quantified by LC–MS as intact glycopeptides in a single experiment. LC–MS peptide mapping of the individual glycosylation sites avoids many of the limitations of preparing and analyzing an entire pool of released N-linked oligosaccharides from all sites mixed together. In this study, LC interfaced to a linear ion trap mass spectrometer (ESI-LIT-MS) were used to characterize the glycosylation of a recombinant IgG1 monoclonal antibody and a CTLA4-Ig fusion protein with multiple sites of N-and O-glycosylation. Samples were reduced, S-carboxyamidomethylated, and cleaved with either trypsin or endoproteinase Asp-N. Enhanced detection for minor IgG1 glycoforms (∼0.1 to 1.0mol% level) was obtained by LC–MS of the longer 32-residue Asp-N glycopeptide (4+ protonated ion) compared to the 9-residue tryptic glycopeptide (2+ ion). LC–MS peptide mapping was run according to a general procedure: (1) Locate N-linked and/or O-linked sites of glycosylation by selected-ion-monitoring of carbohydrate oxonium fragment ions generated by ESI in-source collision-induced dissociation (CID), i.e. 204, 366, and 292Da marker ions for HexNAc, HexNAc-Hex, and NeuAc, respectively; (2) Characterize oligosaccharides at each site via MS and MSMS. Use selected ion currents (SIC) to estimate relative amounts of each glycoform; and (3) Measure the percentage of site-occupancy by searching for any corresponding nonglycosylated peptide.  aPublisher supplied data 3adissociation 3aglycopeptides 3aglycosylation 3aimmunoglobulin G 3aions 3aliquid chromatography 3amass spectrometry 3amonoclonal antibodies 3aoligosaccharides 3apeptide mapping 3apolysaccharides 3atrypsin1 aDevincentis, John1 aFu, Jinmei1 aHuang, Peiqing1 aKirkley, David H.1 aLeister, Kirk1 aLiu, Peiran1 aLudwig, Richard1 aRumney, Kathleen1 aTao, Li1 aWu, Wei1 aRussell, Reb J.0 tJournal of chromatography.g2011 Nov. 11, v. 1218, no. 45 p.8140-8149dElsevier B.V.x0021-96737nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chroma.2011.08.0893Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02732naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245012600168300001800294500001400312520099300326592002801319596009801347596010401445596008601549650001701635650001701652650001801669650001101687650001201698650001701710653001701727653002201744653001701766653001201783653003101795700001401826700001401840700001301854700001801867700001901885700001301904700001801917700001701935700001401952700001501966773013901981856008502120852000902205655001202214IND60692811320221119234708.0200503e20171003xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069281132DNAL7 a10.1080/09168451.2017.13649652doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJin, Zaishun10aMicroRNA-34a induces transdifferentiation of glioma stem cells into vascular endothelial cells by targeting Notch pathway  ap. 1899-1907.  aNAL-light  aThe function of microRNA-34a (miR-34a) in transdifferentiation of glioma stem cells (GSCs) into vascular endothelial cells (VECs) was explored by focusing on Notch ligand Delta-like 1 (Dll1). MiR-34a mimics was transfected into CD133 + glioma cell U251. The angiogenesis feature of miR-34a transfected U251 cells was investigated and the expressions of CD31, CD34, Vwf, Notch 1, and Dll1 were quantified. Length of branching vessel-like structures in the miR-34a transfected U251 cells was significantly higher than control cells. The VEC feature of miR-34a overexpressed U251 cells was further confirmed by the expressions of CD31, CD34, and vWF. Transfection of miR-34a decreased the expression of Notch 1 and Dll1. Furthermore, the miR-34a overexpression-enhanced tube formation of GSCs was suppressed when the decreased expression of Dll1 was restored. The current study highlighted the potential of miR-34a as an inducer in GSCs’ transdifferentiation into VECs by targeting Dll1.  aPublisher supplied data  a81172060cNational Natural Science Foundation of Chinadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100001809  aH201492cNatural Science Foundation of Heilongjiang Provincedhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100005046  a2013TD009cUniversity Innovation Team Project for Cancer Prevention and Treatment 3aangiogenesis 3abiochemistry 3abiotechnology 3aglioma 3aligands 3atransfection 0adelta like 1 0aglioma stem cells 0amicroRNA 34a 0aNotch 1 0avascular endothelial cells1 aZhan, Tao1 aTao, Jing1 aXu, Biao1 aZheng, Huizhe1 aCheng, Yongxia1 aYan, Bin1 aWang, Hongwei1 aLu, Guoqiang1 aLin, Ying1 aGuo, Sufen0 tBioscience, biotechnology, and biochemistry.g2017 Oct. 3, v. 81, no. 10 p.1899-1907dTaylor & FranciswJournal:18959x1347-69477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09168451.2017.13649653Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03279naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001700094024002300111024002800134024002300162024004000185024002500225040001800250100006100268245010900329300001600438500002000454520173100474592002802205650001602233650001302249650001302262650002302275650002502298650000902323650001602332650001502348650001402363650001302377650001802390650001202408700006202420773011702482856011402599856007402713961001302787852000902800655001202809IND60770937020221214225323.0220803e202101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077093702DNAL7 a3738972aris7 a10113/77093702hdl7 a10.1002/agj2.205142doi7 a3738972seq_no_1157 a5030-12210-003-00D2aris_project_no7 a4343952aris_accn_no  aAGLbengcAGL1 aO'Brien, Peter L.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6530-541710aPlant‐to‐plant biomass and yield variability in corn–soybean rotations under three tillage regimes  ap. 370-380.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aAgronomic management practices have the potential to affect plant‐to‐plant variability of biomass accumulation and grain production. However, the relationship between the variability of crop production per plant (i.e., grain weight) and crop production per unit area (i.e., grain yield) is inconsistent because high variability in grain weight has been linked with lower yields in some instances but not others. The objective of this experiment was to investigate plant‐to‐plant variability of biomass accumulation and grain production at three developmental stages in corn (Zea mays L.)–soybean (Glycine max [Merr.] L.) rotations under conventional tillage, strip tillage, and no tillage. Plant‐to‐plant biomass variability, as measured by the coefficient of variation (CV) of crop biomass at three phenological stages, decreased throughout the growing season in corn but increased in soybean; these trends did not differ among tillage systems but did change among the 4 yr of the experiment. The CV of grain weight per corn plant was higher in no‐till for two of the study years, suggesting an interaction between tillage and weather patterns that affects variability. Overall, mean grain weight per plant increased as CV of grain weight decreased in corn but not in soybean. This finding suggests that corn yields were maximized when all individual plants were producing relatively similar amounts of grain, whereas this relationship was not present in soybean. The findings of this study indicate that tillage practices do not consistently affect plant‐to‐plant variability of biomass or grain production and must be understood in context of weather conditions and other agronomic management practices.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGlycine max 3aZea mays 3aagronomy 3abiomass production 3aconventional tillage 3acorn 3agrain yield 3ano-tillage 3aphenology 3asoybeans 3astrip tillage 3aweather1 aHatfield, Jerry L.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2981-88560 tAgronomy journal.g2021 Jan., v. 113, no. 1 p.370-380dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl44592x0002-19627nnas40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/77093703Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/agj2.205143Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/ARS  aDNAL 7aarticle02495naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005400148245016400202300001800366520114700384592002801531650001401559650001401573650002001587650002401607650001701631650004301648650001301691650001401704650001001718650001501728650001601743700001801759700002201777700001901799700002301818700002001841773013201861856008301993852000902076655001202085IND60780444620221121040509.0220620e202207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078044462DNAL7 a10.1007/s13197-021-05312-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJan, Sabbi1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9319-102310aDevelopment and validation of a reverse phase HPLC–DAD method for separation, detection & quantification of rutin and quercetin in buckwheat (Fagopyrum spp.)  ap. 2875-2883.  aBuckwheat has tremendous nutraceutical potential owing to its rutin and quercetin content. The aim of this study was to optimise and validate an analytical method for separating and quantifying these two flavonoids from it. Factors, such as range, linearity, precision, accuracy, limit of detection and limit of quantification, were evaluated for the two compounds using high performance liquid chromatography. On the basis of resolution and symmetry, mobile phase consisting of methanol and methanol:water:acetic acid in the ratio of (100:150:5), flow rate 1.3 ml/min and column temperature 30 °C were found to be optimal analytical conditions. Calibration curves exhibited good linearity with correlation coefficient of 0.995 & 0.9907 over the range 60–180 μg/ml & 2–10 μg/ml for rutin and quercetin respectively. LOD and LOQ values for rutin and quercetin were 6.36, 0.58 and 19.28, 1.77 μg/ml respectively. Recovery values of 96–100.8% confirmed that the method was accurate for rutin and quercetin analysis. This validated method was successfully used to analyse rutin and quercetin in leaves and seeds of buckwheat plant.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFagopyrum 3abuckwheat 3adetection limit 3adietary supplements 3afood science 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3amethanol 3aquercetin 3arutin 3atechnology 3atemperature1 aAhmad, Javaid1 aDar, Mohd Masarat1 aWani, Aijaz A.1 aTahir, Inayatullah1 aKamili, Azra N.0 tJournal of food science and technology.g2022 July, v. 59, no. 7 p.2875-2883dSpringer IndiawJournal:jnl16929x0022-11557nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13197-021-05312-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02913naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245007600168520140100244592002801645650001201673650001901685650001401704650001201718650001301730650001801743650001401761650000901775650001401784650000901798650001401807650001801821650001901839650001601858653001701874653002001891653002001911653001401931653002001945700005701965700005702022700002102079700001902100700005802119700002102177773011402198856008602312852000902398655001202407IND60725970020221116152534.0210428e20210615xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072597002DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhazmat.2021.1252422doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChoi, Dongho10aStrategic disposal of flood debris via CO2-assisted catalytic pyrolysis  aRecent abnormal climate changes resulted in the dramatic alternation of rainfall and flood patterns in many countries. The massive generation of flood debris, a mixture of soil (sediment), biomass, plastic, metal, and various hazardous materials, poses various environmental and public health problems. This study suggests a sustainable technical platform to convert the hazardous materials into value-added products. CO₂-assisted pyrolysis was used to thermally convert flood debris into syngas (H₂ and CO). CO₂ enhanced the syngas production due to gas phase homogeneous reactions (HRs) between CO₂ and volatile hydrocarbons evolved from pyrolysis of flood debris. For improvement of HRs in line with enhancement of syngas production, additional thermal energy and earth abundant catalyst were used. In particular, Ni/SiO₂ catalyst increased more than one order of magnitude higher syngas production, comparing to non-catalytic pyrolysis. Synergistic effect of CO₂ and Ni catalyst showed nearly 50% more production of syngas in reference to catalytic pyrolysis under N₂. During flood debris pyrolysis, compositional matrix of flood debris was also determined by detecting index chemicals of waste materials that cannot be identified by naked eyes. Thus, this study confirmed that CO₂-assisted pyrolysis is a useful tool for conversion of flood debris into value-added chemicals.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiomass 3acarbon dioxide 3acatalysts 3aclimate 3aplastics 3apublic health 3apyrolysis 3arain 3asediments 3asoil 3asynergism 3asynthesis gas 3athermal energy 3avalue added 0aFlood debris 0aDebris disposal 0aWaste-to-energy 0aPyrolysis 0aCO2 utilization1 aJung, Sungyup1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4925-041X1 aJung, Min-Kyu1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6645-23661 aPark, Young-Kwon1 aTsang, Yiu Fai1 aKwon, Hyun-Han1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4465-27081 aKwon, Eilhann E.0 tJournal of hazardous materials.g2021 June 15, v. 412 p.125242-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6200x0304-38947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2021.1252423Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01926naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002600151245012400177300001800301500001900319520037400338592002800712596013100740650001800871650001800889650001500907650002200922650001300944650001100957653001500968653001000983653001800993653002601011700002401037700002101061700002101082700001701103700002101120700001701141700002601158700001601184700002301200773013901223856008501362852000901447655001201456IND60692811420221119234644.0200503e20171102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069281142DNAL7 a10.1080/09168451.2017.13649662doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAbdel-Wahab, Mohammed10aIsolation, structural identification and biological characterization of two conopeptides from the Conus pennaceus venom  ap. 2086-2089.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aA novel anti-mollusk conopeptide pn4c was isolated from the Conus pennaceus venom by repeated HPLC fractionation based on the activity against freshwater snails.

This taxon was intensively studied because these rodents play a role in the epidemiology of various zoonoses (notably bubonic plague), serve as important models for biomedical research, and also sometimes cause extensive agricultural damage. The discovery that M. natalensis sensu lato includes 2 cryptic species in southern Africa has complicated interpretation of the results of past research because previous studies may have been based on either M. coucha or M. natalensis, or even on specimens of both species. A previous study aimed at craniometrically distinguishing between these species in South Africa met with some success, but excluded subadult specimens (which constitute a large proportion of museum collections), and cautioned that intraspecific variation might hamper interspecific discrimination. We therefore studied the nature and extent of nongeographic craniological variation using 2 populations of each species. The discriminatory value of a putative diagnostic dental character (presence or absence of t3 cusp on M3) is limited because of considerable variation within and among populations of M. coucha. Sexual dimorphism is negligible in both species, whereas age-related variation is pronounced and involves mainly differences in overall size, as well as some subtle differences in the configuration of the interorbital, postpalatal, and dental regions. Multiple discriminant function analyses aimed at craniometrically distinguishing between the 2 species showed that the inclusion of subadult specimens reduced a posteriori classification accuracy below 95%% confidence levels, implying that age-related variation is sufficiently pronounced to obscure interspecific craniometric differences. Future studies aimed at craniometrically distinguishing between these cryptic species will, therefore, have to statistically correct for age-related variation.  aPublisher supplied data 0acraniometrics 0aMastomys 0amultimammate mice 0anongeographic variation 0aSouth Africa1 aMerwe, Mac van der1 aNjobe, Khungeka0 tJournal of mammalogy.g2007 Oct., v. 88, no. 5 p.1179-1194dAmerican Society of Mammalogists.x1545-15427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1644%2F06-MAMM-A-439R.13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03896naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100006000147245015400207300001800361500001400379520187700393592002802270596005702298596016502355650001102520650001202531650003002543650001802573650001602591650002202607650001202629650002302641650001602664650002602680650001202706650000902718650001202727650002402739650001302763650001102776650001602787650002202803650001402825650002002839650003402859650001502893650001302908650001402921651001202935700002502947700001802972700001902990700001803009700002003027773014503047856008103192852000903273655001203282IND60684816220221121025730.0200222e202003  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068481622DNAL7 a10.1007/s10668-018-0297-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLoos, Jacqueline1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5186-925412aA highly endangered species on the edge: distribution, habitat use and outlook for Colias myrmidone in newly established Natura 2000 areas in Romania  ap. 2399-2414.  aNAL-light  aRomania is one of the last strongholds of the Danube Clouded Yellow (Colias myrmidone), which is a critically endangered European butterfly species. Knowledge gaps of the ecology and the underlying drivers for its decline hinder the development and implementation of suitable management plans. Here, we investigated habitat characteristics and the social-ecological conditions in two recently established Natura 2000 sites in Romania. We conducted ecological surveys of the species’ occurrence and its habitats. We interviewed local farmers about their land-use practices and their perception of the Natura 2000 areas. Moreover, we investigated the information flow on the Natura 2000 implementation process between representatives of local governmental and non-governmental organizations. Occupied sites contained a mixture of small-scale, extensively used parcels with larger extensively grazed pastures interspersed with semi-natural elements. None of our interview partners knew previously about the designation of the respective Natura 2000 areas. People appreciated conservation efforts for the butterfly but feared restrictions that may narrow their activities and their economic benefits. Further land-use changes may threaten C. myrmidone in Romania still more in future. Fostering viability of humans and butterflies in Romania requires integration of scientific knowledge and people into management decisions. Instead of dictating rigid management schemes, such a participatory approach bears the potential to allow for spatial and temporal heterogeneity that seems to support the butterfly. Eventually, the survival of C. myrmidone depends on coordination between policies and sufficient financial support to maintain traditional and ecologically feasible management instead of detrimental developments such as intensification, abandonment and afforestation.  aPublisher supplied data  aStart Up grantcGeorg-August-Universität Göttingen  a89475cFederal Environment Ministry's Advisory Assistance Programme, funded through the German Environment Agency and the Federal Agency for Nature Conservation 3aColias 3aUrsidae 3aadministrative management 3aafforestation 3abutterflies 3achemical elements 3adecline 3aendangered species 3aenvironment 3aenvironmental surveys 3afarmers 3aflow 3afunding 3ahabitat preferences 3ahabitats 3ahumans 3ainformation 3aissues and policy 3aknowledge 3aland use change 3anongovernmental organizations 3aoccurrence 3apastures 3aviability 3aRomania1 aVizauer, Tibor-Csaba1 aKastal, Agnes1 aDavies, Martin1 aHedrich, Hans1 aDolek, Matthias0 tEnvironment, development and sustainability.g2020 Mar., v. 22, no. 3 p.2399-2414dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl3870050x1387-585X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10668-018-0297-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01628naa a2200529 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024001800097040001800115100001700133245009800150300001600248500001500264520018200279650001700461650002400478650002500502650001500527650001000542650000900552650001000561650002100571650001100592650005500603650001100658650001100669650000900680650004500689650001600734650001600750651001700766651002800783653001600811653001300827653001600840700001800856700001300874700001300887700001500900773010800915852000901023939003301032945000801065946001301073655001201086991589867720742620221116185941.0830404e198209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aPAR830035782DNAL7 a71250612pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWeller, P.F.10aEndemic filariasis on a Pacific Island.

In addition, the applications of kinetoplastid CATB and CATL enzymes as vaccine candidates, diagnostic markers and drug targets are discussed. 3acathepsins 3acysteine 3amammals 3aparasites 3aterminology 3avaccines1 aSteverding, Dietmar0 tMolecular and biochemical parasitology.g2009 Sept., v. 167, no. 1 p.12-19dAmsterdam: Elsevierx0166-68517nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.molbiopara.2009.04.0093Available from publisher's Web site  a20090612b20090703c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03819naa a2200625 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092024002200134024001900156040001800175100001800193245011300211300001400324506007600338520185200414506003702266650002602303650000802329650002402337650002102361650001702382650001902399650002202418650001302440650002002453650003102473650001002504650001602514650001902530650001102549650001402560650001802574650001402592650002202606650005202628650002202680650003502702650001102737700002102748700001902769700002002788700002702808700001702835700001802852700002302870700002602893773011702919852000903036856009203045930003303137946001103170655001203181IND4421721820221207075717.0090612e200909  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442172182DNAL7 a10.1016/j.molbiopara.2009.04.0022doi7 aPMC27059502pmcid7 a194393742pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKnight, Matty10aBiomphalaria glabrata peroxiredoxin: Effect of Schistosoma mansoni infection on differential gene regulation  ap. 20-31.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aTo identify gene(s) that may be associated with resistance/susceptibility in the intermediate snail host Biomphalaria glabrata to Schistosoma mansoni infection, a snail albumen gland cDNA library was differentially screened and a partial cDNA encoding an antioxidant enzyme thioredoxin peroxidase (Tpx), or peroxiredoxin (Prx), was identified. The 753bp full-length, single-copy, constitutively expressed gene now referred to as BgPrx4 was later isolated. BgPrx4 is a 2-Cys peroxiredoxin containing the conserved peroxidatic cysteine (CP) in the N-terminus and the resolving cysteine (CR) in the C-terminus. Sequence analysis of BgPrx4 from both resistant and susceptible snails revealed the presence of several (at least 7) single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Phylogenetic analysis indicated BgPrx4 to resemble a homolog of human peroxiredoxin, PRDX4. Northern analysis of hepatopancreas RNA from both resistant and susceptible snails showed that upon parasite exposure there were qualitative changes in gene expression. Quantitative real-time RT-PCR analysis showed differences in the levels of BgPrx4 transcript induction following infection, with the transcript up-regulated in resistant snails during the early phase (5h) of infection compared to susceptible snails in which it was down-regulated within the early time period. While there was an increase in transcription in susceptible snails later (48h) post-infection, this never reached the levels detected in resistant snails. A similar trend - higher, earlier up-regulation in the resistant snails but lower, slower protein expression in susceptible snails - was observed by Western blot analysis. Enzymatic analysis of the purified, recombinant BgPrx4 revealed the snail sequence to function as Prx but with an unusual ability to use both thioredoxin and glutathione as substrates.0

different conditions in order to determine why final instar caterpillars vary in colour. Poplar hawkmoth caterpillars normally rest on the undersides of leaves. Dull green and redspotted caterpillars are genetically determined polymorphisms. Caterpillars that are not dull green, however, can become white when fed on Populus alba or yellow-green when fed on Salix fragilis. Experiments showed that it is the reflective qualities of the leaves that determines which colour the caterpillar develops: if the young larva sees white then it becomes white, but if it sees green, grey or black then it becomes yellow-green. Young eyed hawkmoth larvae always developed into grey-green final instar caterpillars under our rather poorly-illuminated rearing conditions, but when reared on wild plants in white muslin sleeves they became whitish-green. In this species also it appears that colour of the final instar is determined by the reflectance of the substrate perceived by the young caterpillar. 3aLepidoptera 3alarvae 3aecology 3adensity 3aenvironmental factors 3aleaves 3alight 0agenetic factors 0acoloring1 aEdmunds, M.0 tBiological journal of the Linnean Society.g1989 July, v. 37, no. 3 p.263-279wJournal:jnl1847x0024-40667nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1095-8312.1989.tb01904.x  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03024naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001900152245006700171300001600238520177900254650001802033650002502051650002602076650002402102650001302126650001302139650001602152650001302168650000902181653002202190653002102212653002302233653001802256700002202274700002402296700001902320773011802339852000902457856009202466930003302558946001102591655001202602IND4422656020221116185854.0090703e200908  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442265602DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-2311.2009.01099.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEdwards, Will.10aIs optimal foraging a realistic expectation in orb-web spiders  ap. 527-534.  a1. Explanations for web relocation invoking optimal foraging require reliable differentiation between individual sites and overall habitat quality. We characterised natural conditions of resource variability over 20 days in artificial webs of the orb-web spider Gasteracantha fornicata to examine this requirement. 2. Variability in catch success was high. Day-to-day catch success in 90% (18/20) catch sites fitted negative binomial distributions, whereas 10% fitted Poisson distributions. Considered across trap sites (overall habitat), variance in catch success increased proportionally faster than the mean (i.e. Taylor's Power Law, variance = 0.54mean¹.⁷⁶⁴). 3. We compared the confidence intervals for the expected cumulative catch in randomly drawn sequential samples from a frequency distribution representing the overall habitat (based on the parameters for Taylor's power law) and the frequency distribution of expected cumulative catch within each individual catch site [via randomisation based on the mean and negative binomial exponent (k)]. 4. In all cases and across all sample sizes, median values for the power to differentiate habitat and catch sites never exceeded 0.2, suggesting that principles involved in optimal foraging, if operating, must be accompanied by a very high degree of uncertainty. 5. Under conditions of high resource variability, many days must be spent in a single catch site if movement decisions are based on an ability to differentiate current catch site from overall habitat. Empirical evidence suggests this is never met. This may explain why proximal mechanisms that illicit quickly resolved behavioural responses have been more successful in describing web relocation patterns than those associated with optimal foraging. 3aGasteracantha 3aPoisson distribution 3abinomial distribution 3aconfidence interval 3aforaging 3ahabitats 3auncertainty 3avariance 3awebs 0anegative binomial 0aoptimal foraging 0aTaylor's Power Law 0aweb residency1 aWHYTLAW, POPPY A.1 aCONGDON, BRADLEY C.1 aGASKETT, CHRIS0 tEcological entomology.g2009 Aug., v. 34, no. 4 p.527-534dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0307-69467nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2311.2009.01099.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20090703b20090801c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03513naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002200152245009400174300001600268520203900284650001902323650001602342650001102358650001902369650000902388650001502397650001702412650001202429650001302441650000802454650001202462650001002474650001202484650001302496650002102509650001402530650000902544650002002553650002302573650001702596653003002613653001802643653003902661653003502700773011502735852000902850856009202859930003302951946001102984655001202995IND4422653620221116190054.0090703e200908  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442265362DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-2435.2009.01553.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKurle, Carolyn M.10aInterpreting temporal variation in omnivore foraging ecology via stable isotope modelling  ap. 733-744.  a1. The use of stable carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) isotopes (δ¹⁵N and δ¹³C, respectively) to delineate trophic patterns in wild animals is common in ecology. Their utility as a tool for interpreting temporal change in diet due to seasonality, migration, climate change or species invasion depends upon an understanding of the rates at which stable isotopes incorporate from diet into animal tissues. To best determine the foraging habits of invasive rats on island ecosystems and to illuminate the interpretation of wild omnivore diets in general, I investigated isotope incorporation rates of C and N in fur, liver, kidney, muscle, serum and red blood cells (RBC) from captive rats raised on a diet with low δ¹⁵N and δ¹³C values and switched to a diet with higher δ¹⁵N and δ¹³C values. 2. I used the reaction progress variable method (RPVM), a linear fitting procedure, to estimate whether a single or multiple compartment model best described isotope turnover in each tissue. Small sample Akaike Information criterion (AICc) model comparison analysis indicated that 1 compartment nonlinear models best described isotope incorporation rates for liver, RBC, muscle, and fur, whereas 2 compartment nonlinear models were best for serum and kidney. 3. I compared isotope incorporation rates using the RPVM versus nonlinear models. There were no differences in estimated isotope retention times between the model types for serum and kidney (except for N turnover in kidney from females). Isotope incorporation took longer when estimated using the nonlinear models for RBC, muscle, and fur, but was shorter for liver tissue. 4. There were no statistical differences between sexes in the isotope incorporation rates. I also found that N and C isotope incorporation rates were decoupled for liver, with C incorporating into liver tissue faster than N. 5. The data demonstrate the utility of analysing isotope ratios of multiple tissues from a single animal when estimating temporal variation in mammalian foraging ecology. 3aanimal tissues 3ablood serum 3acarbon 3aclimate change 3adiet 3aecosystems 3aerythrocytes 3afemales 3aforaging 3afur 3akidneys 3aliver 3amuscles 3anitrogen 3anonlinear models 3aomnivores 3arats 3astable isotopes 3atemporal variation 3awild animals 0aomnivore foraging ecology 0ainvasive rats 0astable isotope incorporation rates 0astable isotope turnover models0 tFunctional ecology.g2009 Aug., v. 23, no. 4 p.733-744dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0269-84637nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2435.2009.01553.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20090703b20090801c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03213naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100002700171245014500198300001600343520151100359650001801870650001701888650001701905650001201922650003001934650003001964650003001994650003902024650004002063650002802103650001102131650004202142650003802184650002602222650004502248650003602293650005002329653001502379653002402394653001402418700002302432773011902455852000902574856009202583930003302675946001102708655001202719IND4422651020221116185941.0090703e200907  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442265102DNAL7 a195946342pmid7 a10.1111/j.1600-065X.2009.00787.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRabinovich, Gabriel A.10aConveying glycan information into T-cell homeostatic programs: a challenging role for galectin-1 in inflammatory and tumor microenvironments  ap. 144-159.  aThe immune system has evolved sophisticated mechanisms composed of several checkpoints and fail-safe processes that enable it to orchestrate innate and adaptive immunity, while at the same time limiting aberrant or unfaithful T-cell function. These multiple regulatory pathways take place during the entire life-span of T cells including T-cell development, homing, activation, and differentiation. Galectin-1, an endogenous glycan-binding protein widely expressed at sites of inflammation and tumor growth, controls a diversity of immune cell processes, acting either extracellularly through specific binding to cell surface glycan structures or intracellularly through modulation of pathways that remain largely unexplored. In this review, we highlight the discoveries that have led to our current understanding of the role of galectin-1 in distinct immune cell process, particularly those associated with T-cell homeostasis. Also, we emphasize findings emerging from the study of experimental models of autoimmunity, chronic inflammation, fetomaternal tolerance, and tumor growth, which have provided fundamental insights into the critical role of galectin-1 and its specific saccharide ligands in immunoregulation. Challenges for the future will embrace the rational manipulation of galectin-1-glycan interactions both towards attenuating immune responses in autoimmune diseases, graft rejection, and recurrent fetal loss, while at the same overcoming immune tolerance in chronic infections and cancer. 3aglycosylation 3aautoimmunity 3ainflammation 2aAnimals 2aCell Adhesionximmunology 2aCell Movementximmunology 2aCell Survivalximmunology 2aCytokinesximmunologyxmetabolism. 2aGalectin 1ximmunologyxmetabolism. 2aHomeostasisximmunology 2aHumans 2aInflammationximmunologyxmetabolism. 2aLymphocyte Activationximmunology 2aNeoplasmsximmunology 2aPolysaccharidesximmunologyxmetabolism. 2aSignal Transductionximmunology 2aT-Lymphocyte Subsetsximmunologyxmetabolism. 0agalectin-1 0atumor-immune escape 0atolerance1 aIlarregui, Juan M.0 tImmunological reviews.g2009 July, v. 230, no. 1 p.144-159dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0105-28967nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1600-065X.2009.00787.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20090703b20090801c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle01377naa a2200313 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245006000126300001400186500001500200520049800215650001700713650001500730650002200745650001500767650003400782650002000816653002300836653001600859653002900875773009200904852000900996939003301005946001301038655001201051IND8905547720221116190224.0891012e198904  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND890554772DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGresser, E.10aSoft confrontation: dealing with inappropriate behavior  ap. 44-48.  a2019-12-04  aThis article describes how to deal with inappropriate behavior in both applicants and current volunteers using soft confrontation techniques.

Regular and systematic outcomes assessment is one means to evaluate the program for purposes of sustaining this level of excellence. The purpose of this study was to conduct a survey of horticulture graduates to determine preparedness when entering the workforce, departmental effectiveness, and to evaluate how well graduates met departmental learner outcomes. A 59-question survey instrument was distributed electronically to a proportional sample of 221 horticulture alumni who graduated between 2000 and 2006. The response rate was 47%. Results showed that graduates found jobs quickly, and a majority (76.7%) noted that their first and current jobs were highly related to their degree. Furthermore, 41.8% rated themselves as adequately prepared, 37.9% as more than adequately prepared, and 15.5% as exceptionally well prepared for their first job. Respondents also ranked their abilities related to the 33 learner outcomes questions as good to excellent. 3ahorticulture 3auniversities 3acurriculum 3ahigher education 3acollege students 3asurveys 3aprofessional education 3aemployment opportunities 3aIowa1 aVanDerZanden, Ann Marie1 aHaynes, Cynthia1 aEsters, Levon0 tHortTechnology.g2008 , v. 18, no. 3 p.524-528wJournal:2120x1063-01987nnas  aDNAL  a20090821b20091002c00000000  aINDd2CTe2009/07/22  aOther US 7aarticle02421naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127072001700144100001800161245006000179300001600239520131100255650001901566650001201585650002001597650001401617650002201631650002501653650002001678650001101698650001301709650001301722650001201735650001101747650001401758650002401772700002901796773008201825852000901907930003301916945002501949946001301974655001201987IND4422627120221116190406.0090702e200810  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442262712DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aJenni, Sylvie10aQuantifying Phenology and Maturity in Crisphead Lettuce  ap. 553-558.  aThe Biologische Bundesanstalt, Bundessortenamt und Chemische Industrie (BBCH) identification key was adapted for crisphead lettuce (Lactuca sativa) to facilitate identification of phenological stages and decisions regarding field operations from seeding to harvest maturity. The original system described leaf development based on leaf count from stage 11 (1 leaf) to stage 19 (9 leaf), and head development based on percentage of expected head size reached at maturity from stage 41 to 49. The new coding leaf development stages range from 11 to 29, corresponding to the 1-leaf to 19-leaf stages. The head development stages also ranged from 41 to 49, but phenological stages near commercial maturity from 43 to 49 are now described as a function of head firmness. The important maturity traits of crisphead lettuce include head size and density. Head volume can be estimated from three diameters by using Currence's equation, which takes into account head geometry. The firmness index obtained by hand compression gave a more precise estimate of head density than the density estimate derived from Currence's equation or the sphere equation. Crisphead lettuce development stages and maturity traits can be easily quantified in the field for use in planning field operations and for experimental purposes. 3aLactuca sativa 3alettuce 3avegetable crops 3aphenology 3aplant development 3adevelopmental stages 3adecision making 3aleaves 3afirmness 3adiameter 3adensity 3avolume 3aequations 3amathematical models1 aBourgeois, G.q(Gaétan)0 tHortTechnology.g2008 , v. 18, no. 4 p.553-558wJournal:2120x1063-01987nnas  aDNAL  a20091119b20091204c00000000  aINDd2CTe2009/07/27  aOther US 7aarticle03935naa a2200637 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024002800133040001800161100001800179245016000197300001600357506007600373520191000449506003702359650001302396650000902409650001202418650002102430650001402451650002202465650002002487650002102507650001502528650001402543650001802557650002202575650003602597650001502633650003202648650002802680650002302708650002102731650004102752650001302793650004602806650006302852650006202915650002302977651001003000651001103010653001103021700002003032700001903052700001503071773009203086852000903178856004103187930003303228945001303261946001103274655001203285IND2329865620221207074306.0021126e200203  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232986562DNAL7 a120967402pmid7 aPMC42338162pmcid7 a10.1093/aob/mcf0372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCollins, R.P.10aVariation amongst survivor populations of white clover collected from sites across Europe: growth attributes and physiological responses to low temperature  ap. 283-292.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aExperiments were carried out at IGER, Aberystwyth, UK to investigate traits of direct relevance to the processes of overwintering and spring growth in white clover (Trifolium repens L.). The plant material used was derived from baseline populations of the cultivar AberHerald and survivor populations generated after 2-3 years' growth in Germany (Kiel), Sweden (Uppsala) and Switzerland (Zurich). The aims of the experiments were to measure the level of genetic shift that had occurred in certain traits due to selection in the survivor populations by comparing these with the baseline population. The adaptive significance of traits was assessed by determining the extent to which stabilizing selection had operated to reduce levels of intra-population variation. Significant differences were found in the responses of leaf production to two temperature treatments in the survivor populations from Germany and Sweden compared with the Swiss and baseline material. Plants of the former two populations produced much more leaf than the others at the higher temperature, but leaf production rates at the lower temperature did not differ. As this experiment used cloned genotypes in the two treatments, the result suggests that a higher degree of phenotypic plasticity for this trait had been selected for in the German and Swedish populations. These populations also showed greater rates of regrowth of leaves from terminal buds exposed to sub-zero temperatures, but there were no differences between populations in levels of freezing tolerance, or in stolon carbohydrate content. Genetic shift occurred in the degree of unsaturation of stolon lipids, with all three survivor populations possessing higher proportions of unsaturated fatty acids than the baseline. Stabilizing selection also operated on this trait in the survivor populations, suggesting that it is of adaptive significance in cool climates.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aregrowth 3abuds 3astolons 3aTrifolium repens 3amortality 3agenetic variation 3aair temperature 3aplant physiology 3aprovenance 3acultivars 3agenetic drift 3anatural selection 3achemical constituents of plants 3apopulation 2aAcclimatizationxphysiology 2aCarbohydrate Metabolism 2aCloning, Molecular 2aCold Temperature 2aFatty Acids, Unsaturatedxmetabolism 2aGenotype 2aMedicagoxgeneticsxgrowth & development. 2aPlant Leavesxchemistryxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aPlant Stemsxchemistryxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aSelection, Genetic 3aWales 0aEurope 0agrowth1 aHelgadottir, A.1 aFothergill, M.1 aRhodes, I.0 tAnnals of botany.g2002 Mar., v. 89, no. 3 p.283-292wJournal:jnl44715x0305-73647nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/aob/mcf037  a20030203b20030211c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US 7aarticle03495naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024002800133040001800161100001700179245008300196300001600279506007600295520194400371506003702315650002402352650000902376650002202385650002202407650001802429650002002447650002102467650001302488650004102501650002802542650003702570650002302607650004802630650001602678650001702694653001702711700001502728700001802743700001702761773009202778852000902870856004102879930003302920945001302953946001102966655001202977IND2329563020221207074302.0021105e200206  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232956302DNAL7 a121025252pmid7 aPMC42338332pmcid7 a10.1093/aob/mcf1132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAustin, P.T.10aModelling kiwifruit budbreak as a function of temperature and bud interactions  ap. 695-706.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThis paper presents two models of budbreak on canes of 'Hayward' kiwifruit (Actinidia deliciosa). A conventional 'chill unit' (CU) type model is compared with an alternative 'loss of potential' (LOP) approach, which assumes that the number of buds developing in spring depends on climate and node position-dependent bud-to-bud interactions that vary in duration and intensity. Both models describe how temperature, and application of a dormancy-breaking chemical, determine the overall amount of budbreak for whole canes. However, the LOP model does so by describing patterns of budbreak along canes. To do this, the cumulative influence of distal neighbours is assumed to cause a progressive fall in the capacity for bud development over the autumn-winter period, an influence that gets stronger as temperature rises. The LOP model also assumes that the rate of decline varies along the cane, as a function of some inherent bud property. These two factors mean that buds towards the base of the cane break less often under the suppressive influence of distal neighbours, while low temperature ('chilling') increases budbreak by diminishing the intensity of suppression relative to bud development rate. Under this scenario, dormancy-breaking chemicals (such as hydrogen cyanamide, HC) enhance budbreak by diminishing the duration of suppression. Models were calibrated using daily temperature series and budbreak proportion data from a multi-year regional survey, and were then tested against independent data sets. Both models were run from a fixed start date until the time budbreak was almost complete, or until a standard date. The fitted models described 87% of variation in amount of budbreak due to site, year, HC and node position effects in the original data set. Results suggest that the correlation between chilling and the amount of budbreak can be interpreted as a population-based phenomenon based on interaction among buds.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aActinidia deliciosa 3abuds 3adormancy breaking 3asimulation models 3agrowth models 3aair temperature 3aclimatic factors 3aduration 2aActinidiaxdrug effectsxphysiology. 2aCyanamidexpharmacology 2aFruitxdrug effectsxphysiology. 2aModels, Biological 2aPlant Structuresxdrug effectsxphysiology. 2aTemperature 2aTime Factors 0ainteractions1 aHall, A.J.1 aSnelgar, W.P.1 aCurrie, M.J.0 tAnnals of botany.g2002 June, v. 89, no. 6 p.695-706wJournal:jnl44715x0305-73647nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/aob/mcf113  a20021201b20021209c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US 7aarticle04064naa a2200829 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024002800133040001800161100001400179245010100193300001600294500001500310506007600325520158700401506003701988650001902025650001202044650001202056650002202068650001702090650001802107650002202125650002002147650003702167650002502204650001002229650001302239650001402252650003202266650001202298650001902310650003102329650001802360650001202378650005502390650003702445650003302482650002102515650002502536650001402561650001802575650002702593650003102620650002202651650002202673650003502695650004102730650003302771650001502804650003402819650002002853650002402873650002202897653002202919653001102941653001602952653000902968700001502977700001502992700001603007773009203023852000903115856004103124930003303165945001303198946001103211655001203222IND2329228120221207074256.0021008e200202  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232922812DNAL7 a120993482pmid7 aPMC42337912pmcid7 a10.1093/aob/mcf0262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDesel, C.10aPainting of parental chromatin in beta hybrids by multi-colour fluorescent in situ hybridization  ap. 171-181.  a2019-12-05  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aSugar beet (Beta vulgaris L.) is a relatively young crop and has a narrow gene pool. In order to introduce genetic variability into the crop, interspecific hybrids, selected from crosses with wild beets of the sections Corollinae and Procumbentes, have been generated. The introgressed B. procumbens chromatin carries resistance genes to beet cyst nematode Heterodera schachtii Schm. These lines are important for breeding of nematode-resistant sugar beet, while Corollinae species are potential donors of tolerance to biotic and abiotic stresses such as drought or saline soils. We have used in situ hybridization of genomic DNA to discriminate the parental chromosomes in these interspecific hybrids. Suppression of cross-hybridization by blocking DNA was not necessary indicating that the investigated Beta genomes contain sufficient species-specific DNA enabling the unequivocal determination of the genomic composition of the hybrids. Interspecific hybrid lines with an additional chromosome (2n = 18 + 1), chromosome fragment (2n = 18 + fragment) or translocation of B. procumbens (2n = 18) were analysed by genomic in situ hybridization (GISH) at mitosis and meiosis. Species-specific satellites and ribosomal genes used in combination with genomic DNA or in rehybridization experiments served as landmark probes for chromosome identification in hybrid genomes. The detection of a B. procumbens translocation of approx. 1 Mbp demonstrated the sensitivity and resolution of GISH and showed that this approach is a powerful method in genome analysis projects of the genus Beta.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3asalt tolerance 3amitosis 3ahybrids 3achromosome number 3afluorescence 3aribosomal DNA 3adrought tolerance 3aBeta procumbens 3atranslocation (plant physiology) 3aHeterodera schachtii 3agenes 3agenomics 3achromatin 3ainterspecific hybridization 3ameiosis 3awild relatives 3anucleic acid hybridization 3aBeta vulgaris 2aAnimals 2aBeta vulgarisxgeneticsxparasitologyxphysiology. 2aChromatinxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aChromosome Paintingxmethods 2aCrosses, Genetic 2aDNA Probesxgenetics 2aDisasters 2aGenome, Plant 2aHybridization, Genetic 2aImmunity, Innatexgenetics 2aMeiosisxgenetics 2aMitosisxgenetics 2aNematodaxgrowth & development 2aNucleic Acid Hybridizationxgenetics 2aPlant Diseasesxparasitology 2aPolyploidy 2aSodium Chloridexpharmacology 2aSoilxanalysis. 2aSpecies Specificity 2aWaterxphysiology 0abeta corolliflora 0astress 0achromosomes 0aBeta1 aJansen, R.1 aDedong, G.1 aSchmidt, T.0 tAnnals of botany.g2002 Feb., v. 89, no. 2 p.171-181wJournal:jnl44715x0305-73647nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/aob/mcf026  a20030101b20030107c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US 7aarticle02729naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003200092040001800124100001700142245006000159300001600219500001500235520152300250650001601773650001501789650001301804650002101817650001501838650001301853650001901866650003601885650002001921650001001941650001901951650002101970653001001991653001902001653001402020700001702034700001702051773009202068852000902160856004502169930003302214945001302247946001102260655001202271IND2325364220221116182412.0020213e200108  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232536422DNAL7 a10.1006/anbo.2001.14532doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIlarslan, H.10aCalcium oxalate crystals in developing seeds of soybean  ap. 243-257.  a2019-12-05  aYoung developing soybean seeds contain relatively large amounts of calcium oxalate (CaOx) monohydrate crystals. A test for Ca and CaOx indicated that Ca deposits and crystals initially occurred in the funiculus, where a single vascular bundle enters the seed. Crystals formed in the integuments until the embryo enlarged enough to crush the inner portion of the inner integument. Crystals then appeared in the developing cotyledon tissues and embryo axis. All crystals formed in cell vacuoles. Dense bodies and membrane complexes were evident in the funiculus. In the inner integument, cell vacuoles assumed the shape of the future crystals. This presumed predetermined crystal mould is reported here for the first time for soybean seeds. As crystals in each tissue near maturity, a wall forms around each crystal. This intracellular crystal wall becomes contiguous with the cell wall. Integument crystals remain visible until the enlarging embryo crushes the integuments; the crystals then disappear. A related study revealed that the highest percent of oxalate by dry mass was reached in the developing + 16 d (post-fertilization) seeds, and then decreased during late seed maturation. At +60 d, CaOx formation and disappearance are an integral part of developing soybean seeds. Our results suggest that Ca deposits and crystals functionally serve as Ca storage for the rapidly enlarging embryos. The oxalate, derived from one or more possible metabolic pathways, could be involved in seed storage protein synthesis. 3aGlycine max 3acell walls 3acrystals 3aseed development 3acotyledons 3avacuoles 3ahistochemistry 3achemical constituents of plants 3acalcium oxalate 3ashape 3aultrastructure 3avascular bundles 0aseeds 0aembryo (plant) 0aepidermis1 aPalmer, R.G.1 aHorner, H.T.0 tAnnals of botany.g2001 Aug., v. 88, no. 2 p.243-257wJournal:jnl44715x0305-73647nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1006/anbo.2001.1453  a20020401b20020405c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US 7aarticle02199naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003200092040001800124100002400142245009100166300001600257500001500273520084000288650002801128650001101156650001301167650001101180650002001191650001801211650001501229650001801244650001501262650002601277650001501303650001901318653002401337653001401361653002201375653001601397653002601413653002501439700001801464700002001482773009201502852000901594856004501603930003301648945001301681946001101694655001201705IND2325751420221116182623.0020302e200110  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232575142DNAL7 a10.1006/anbo.2001.14992doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVander Willigen, C.10aAnomalous pressure volume curves of resurrection plants do not suggest negative turgor  ap. 537-543.  a2019-12-05  aPressure-volume (PV) curves of the desiccation-tolerant angiosperms, Eragrostis nindensis, Craterostigma wilmsii and Xerophyta humilis, and the desiccation-sensitive species, E. curvula, were compared. The shape of curves for E. nindensis and C. wilmsii differed from the usual curvilinear form. Over the relative water content (RWC) range of approx. 70 to 25%, PV curves indicated water potentials higher than directly measured water activity on frozen-thawed tissue. Anatomical studies showed considerable cell wall folding and a consequent reduction in cell volume in these two species; this was not seen in X. humilis or E. curvula which showed normal PV curves. It is suggested that this wall folding may have prevented the development of negative turgor and physical stress in the cells, and contributed to desiccation tolerance. 3ainterspecific variation 3aturgor 3apressure 3avolume 3awater potential 3aplant anatomy 3acell walls 3awater content 3axerophytes 3abiological resistance 3aEragrostis 3awater activity 0aspecies differences 0atolerance 0axerophyta humilis 0adesiccation 0acraterostigma wilmsii 0aeragrostic nindensis1 aFarrant, J.M.1 aPammenter, N.W.0 tAnnals of botany.g2001 Oct., v. 88, no. 4 p.537-543wJournal:jnl44715x0305-73647nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1006/anbo.2001.1499  a20020501b20020507c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US 7aarticle04801naa a2200601 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003200092040001800124100001900142245015500161300001600316500004000332500001500372520302000387650001403407650001803421650002203439650002103461650003603482650001903518650002003537650002003557650001803577650002303595650003703618650002203655650001303677650001003690650002103700650002103721651001103742653002203753653001603775653001103791700001803802700001703820700001903837700002703856700001903883700001603902700002003918700002003938700001803958773010003976852000904076856004504085930003304130945001304163946001104176655001204187IND2328263620221116182449.0020729e200110  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232826362DNAL7 a10.1006/anbo.2001.14962doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWachendorf, M.10aOverwintering and growing season dynamics of Trifolium repens L. in mixture with Lolium perenne L.: a model approach to plant-environment interactions  ap. 683-702.  aIn the special issue: White clover.  a2019-12-05  aIn attempting to increase the reliability of clover contribution in clover/ryegrass systems it is important to understand the roles of (1) specific traits of the clover genotype (2) climate and (3) their interactions in determining clover behaviour in swards. Overwintering and spring growth of white clover (cultivars AberHerald and Huia) grown in binary mixtures with perennial ryegrass were measured at 12 European sites ranging in latitude from Reykjavik, Iceland (64 degrees 30' N) to Pordenone, Italy (46 degrees 30' N). In the overwintering period, tiller density of the grass was assessed and detailed morphological and chemical measurements were made on the clover at each sampling time. During the growing season, the clover contribution to total available biomass was recorded. Detailed climatic data were available at all sites. The annual growth cycle of swards was divided into four functional periods (spring, summer, autumn and winter). Within each functional period community responses were modelled. The models incorporated independent biotic variables characterizing each community within each site at the start of the period and independent variables characterizing the climate at each site during the period. The models were linked dynamically by taking, as response variable(s) for a functional period, the independent biotic variable(s) of the succeeding period. In general, the modelling strategy was successful in producing a series of biologically meaningful linked models. Essential prerequisites for this were (a) the establishment of a well-devised common protocol prior to the experiment and (b) the extensive gradients of climatic and other variables obtained by using numerous sites. AberHerald generally performed as well as, or better than, Huia throughout the annual cycle across the range of climatic conditions encountered, and especially under low temperature conditions in winter and autumn. Clover leaf area index appeared to be a key variable in determining clover performance over winter and through the following growing season. Grass tiller density had a strong negative effect on clover content in spring but only at low temperatures. This emphasizes the importance of a high clover leaf area index in autumn as the main biotic factor related to spring clover content in milder conditions. The importance of climatic variables in the models is their use in explaining the reliability of the contribution of clover in clover/ryegrass systems. Temperature was the primary climatic determinant of clover response in all periods, having a direct effect on clover content and leaf area index or mediating the effect of the associate species. Radiation strongly influenced clover dynamics during winter and spring but not in the other periods, possibly because it was confounded with the effect of higher temperature. Precipitation was positively related to clover growth during spring and autumn and was related to tiller density in a complex manner during autumn and winter. 3acultivars 3aoverwintering 3asimulation models 3aTrifolium repens 3achemical constituents of plants 3aLolium perenne 3aair temperature 3aleaf area index 3aplant density 3aseasonal variation 3agenotype-environment interaction 3aplant competition 3agenotype 3asward 3aplant morphology 3aclimatic factors 3aEurope 0aplant communities 0apersistence 0agrowth1 aCollins, R.P.1 aElgersma, A.1 aFothergill, M.1 aFrankow-Lindberg, B.E.1 aGhesquiere, A.1 aGuckert, A.1 aGuinchard, M.P.1 aHelgadottir, A.1 aLüscher, A.,0 tAnnals of botany.g2001 Oct., v. 88, no. special . p.683-702wJournal:jnl44715x0305-73647nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1006/anbo.2001.1496  a20021002b20021010c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US 7aarticle02777naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003200092040001800124100001400142245011300156300001600269500004000285500001500325520141200340650001401752650002101766650001301787650001001800650001901810650001101829650002601840650002301866650002001889650002301909650001001932650002101942651001901963653001201982653001501994653001602009653001102025700001702036700001902053773010002072852000902172856004502181930003302226945001302259946001102272655001202283IND2328244820221116182502.0020726e200110  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232824482DNAL7 a10.1006/anbo.2001.14932doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNolan, T.10aMixed grazing and climatic determinants of white clover (Trifolium repens L.) content in a permanent pasture  ap. 713-724.  aIn the special issue: White clover.  a2019-12-05  aThe effects of grazing regime (cattle, sheep and mixed cattle + sheep) on white clover content (clover dry matter as a percentage of total dry matter) were measured in a permanent pasture over a 7 year period in the west of Ireland (53 degrees 17'N 8 degrees 47'E). Rotational grazing was simulated by grazing for short intense periods of 3-4 d at 3 to 5 week intervals. In general, cattle grazing resulted in higher clover content (13.5%) compared with mixed (9.5%) or sheep (4.9%) grazing. The ranking of clover contents (cattle > mixed > sheep) which developed rapidly in 1990 persisted until 1996. Clover contents under mixed grazing tracked those under cattle grazing during the first 4 years, and sheep grazing during the final 3 years. Within-year relativities in clover content among grazing regimes that existed at the start of the grazing season persisted throughout the year. There was an indication that differences in clover content between grazing regimes at the end of grazing persisted until the following spring. A regression analysis of clover content in each grazing period showed strong effects of grazing regime, generally positive relationships with mean air temperature in the period and clover content in the preceding period, and an interaction between air temperature and clover content in the previous period. Implications for pasture management and experimentation are discussed. 3acultivars 3aTrifolium repens 3apastures 3asheep 3aLolium perenne 3acattle 3abotanical composition 3arotational grazing 3aair temperature 3aseasonal variation 3asward 3aclimatic factors 3aIrish Republic 0agrazing 0adry matter 0apersistence 0agrowth1 aConnolly, J.1 aWachendorf, M.0 tAnnals of botany.g2001 Oct., v. 88, no. special . p.713-724wJournal:jnl44715x0305-73647nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1006/anbo.2001.1493  a20021002b20021010c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US 7aarticle03076naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003200092040001800124100002300142245010900165300001600274500004000290500001500330520168900345650001402034650001102048650002102059650001202080650001202092650001402104650002802118650001102146650002102157650001302178650000802191650003602199650001402235651001202249653001402261653001602275653001102291653001502302700002002317700002202337773010002359852000902459856004502468930003302513945001302546946001102559655001202570IND2328245820221116182425.0020726e200110  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232824582DNAL7 a10.1006/anbo.2001.14652doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDalmannsdottir, S.10aFatty acid and sugar content in white clover in relation to frost tolerance and ice-encasement tolerance  ap. 753-759.  aIn the special issue: White clover.  a2019-12-05  aPhysiological characters relating to winter survival were measured in stolons of three white clover populations. Plants were grown in pots and hardened naturally outside in Iceland (66 degrees N); samples were taken on three occasions from autumn to spring. The cultivar AberHerald was compared with a population that had survived one winter in experimental plots in southern Iceland (AberHerald selected) and an indigenous population from Norway (HoKv9238). Frost tolerance and ice-encasement tolerance were determined in the laboratory using meristematic stolon cuttings, and the temperature and number of days required to kill 50% of the population were calculated. Fatty acid and sugar contents of stolons were measured in the same material. The Norwegian population HoKv9238 was much more winter-hardy than the AberHerald populations and its stolons had a higher dry matter percentage. Total amounts of unsaturated fatty acids were higher in HoKv9238 than in AberHerald populations, with differences being most prominent for the 18:2 fatty acid. In September, the starch content was significantly higher in stolons of HoKv9238 than in those of the two AberHerald populations, but by January the starch content had decreased drastically, especially in HoKv9238. Sucrose was the most abundant water-soluble carbohydrate: in September, populations had similar sucrose contents but levels had decreased by January in AberHerald populations but not in HoKv9238. Comparison of the two AberHerald populations showed that the selected population was more frost- and ice-encasement tolerant than the original population in autumn. This coincided with higher levels of the 18:2 fatty acid. 3acultivars 3awinter 3aTrifolium repens 3asucrose 3astolons 3ameristems 3aunsaturated fatty acids 3astarch 3afrost resistance 3aduration 3aice 3achemical constituents of plants 3amortality 3aIceland 0atolerance 0afatty acids 0asugars 0adry matter1 aHelgadottir, A.1 aGudleifsson, B.E.0 tAnnals of botany.g2001 Oct., v. 88, no. special . p.753-759wJournal:jnl44715x0305-73647nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1006/anbo.2001.1465  a20021002b20021010c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US 7aarticle02844naa a2200637 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002500164245007000189300001600259520087400275650002401149650002301173650002201196650001601218650002601234650001601260650000901276650002101285650001501306650001001321650000901331650001401340650001201354650002101366650002701387650001101414650001201425650003001437650002301467650003801490650003801528650002201566650003601588650002601624650005101650650004101701653001401742653001601756653002201772700002601794700002601820700002301846700002501869700002001894773014001914852000902054856008502063930003302148946001302181655001202194IND4396200220221116182720.0071021e200711  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439620022DNAL7 a178824732pmid7 a10.1007/s00244-006-0173-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTkatcheva, Victoria 10aPhysiological and Biochemical Effects of Lithium in Rainbow Trout  ap. 632-638.  aThe physiological responses of juvenile rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) to lithium (as LiCl) in moderately hard freshwater (CaCO₃ = 120-140 ppm, Na⁺ = ~0.6 mM) were studied. The study employed a 15-day step-up exposure regime; 66 μg/L Li for the first 9 days and 528 μg/L for the next 6 days. The concentrations of plasma ions, apolipoprotein AI, total cholesterol, and fatty acids, as well as metabolic enzyme citrate synthase (CS) and Na⁺,K⁺-ATPase activities in the gill were measured. Li affected fish by exacerbated diffusive Na⁺ losses at the gills in the beginning of exposure and a decrease of branchial CS activity. Detrimental effects were shown in fish exposed to 528 μg Li/L. These included a reduction of gill Na⁺,K⁺-ATPase activity, possibly related to observed lower concentrations of free fatty acids and cholesterol in gill tissue. 3aOncorhynchus mykiss 3aapolipoprotein A-I 3acalcium carbonate 3acholesterol 3acitrate (si)-synthase 3afatty acids 3afish 3afree fatty acids 3afreshwater 3agills 3aions 3ajuveniles 3alithium 3alithium chloride 3aphysiological response 3asodium 2aAnimals 2aApolipoprotein A-Ixblood 2aCholesterolxblood 2aCitrate (si)-Synthasexmetabolism 2aFatty Acids, Nonesterifiedxblood 2aLithiumxtoxicity 2aOncorhynchus mykissxphysiology 2aOsmolar Concentration 2aSodium-Potassium-Exchanging ATPasexmetabolism 2aWater Pollutants, Chemicalxtoxicity 0aFish gill 0aPlasma ions 0aApolipoprotein AI1 aFranklin, Natasha M. 1 aMcClelland, Grant B. 1 aSmith, Richard W. 1 aHolopainen, Ismo J. 1 aWood, Chris M. 0 tArchives of environmental contamination and toxicology.g2007 Nov., v. 53, no. 4 p.632-638dNew York : Springer-Verlagx0090-43417nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00244-006-0173-53Available from publisher's Web site  a20071021b20071102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle03631naa a2200661 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002800164245011000192300001600302520183100318650002002149650001302169650001102182650001202193650001302205650001102218650001102229650000902240650001002249650001402259650001902273650001202292650001502304650001302319650001102332650001402343650000802357650001302365650000902378650001602387650001202403650001102415650002102426650000902447650002402456650002902480650002402509651001102533651001702544651001102561651001602572651001402588651001102602700002002613700002202633700002202655773014002677852000902817856008502826930003302911946001302944655001202957IND4394586820221116182841.0070902e200710  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439458682DNAL7 a175711992pmid7 a10.1007/s00244-007-0018-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKannan, Kurunthachalam 10aTrace Element Concentrations in Livers of Polar Bears from Two Populations in Northern and Western Alaska  ap. 473-482.  aConcentrations of 20 trace elements (V, Cr, Mn, Co, Cu, Zn, Rb, Sr, Mo, Ag, Cd, In, Sn, Sb, Cs, Ba, Hg, Tl, Pb, and Bi) were measured in livers of polar bears (Ursus maritimus) collected from Northern and Western Alaska from 1993 to 2002 to examine differences in the profiles of trace metals between the Beaufort Sea (Northern Alaska) and the Chukchi Sea (Western Alaska) subpopulations in Alaska. Among the trace elements analyzed, concentrations of Cu (50-290 μg/g, dry wt) in polar bear livers were in the higher range of values that have been reported for marine mammals. Concentrations of Hg in polar bears varied widely, from 3.5 to 99 μg/g dry wt, and the mean concentrations in polar bears were comparable to concentrations reported previously for several other species of marine mammals. Mean concentrations of Pb and Cd were 0.67 and 1.0 μg/g dry wt, respectively; these concentrations were lower than levels reported elsewhere for polar bears from Greenland and Canada. Age- and gender-related variations in the concentrations of trace elements in our polar bears were minimal. Concentrations of Hg decreased slowly in samples collected during 1993-2002, whereas Cd and Pb concentrations were found to be stable or slowly increasing, in the livers of Alaskan polar bears. Concentrations of Ag, Bi, Ba, Cu, and Sn were significantly higher in the Chukchi Sea subpopulation than in the Beaufort Sea subpopulation. Concentrations of Hg were significantly higher in the Beaufort Sea subpopulation than in the Chukchi Sea subpopulation. Differences in the profiles and concentrations of Hg, Ag, Bi, Ba, Cu, and Sn suggest that the sources of exposure to these trace elements between Western and Northern Alaskan polar bears are different, in agreement with findings reported earlier for several organic contaminants. 3aUrsus maritimus 3aantimony 3abarium 3acadmium 3achromium 3acobalt 3acopper 3alead 3aliver 3amanganese 3amarine mammals 3amercury 3amolybdenum 3arubidium 3asilver 3astrontium 3atin 3avanadium 3azinc 2aAge Factors 2aAnimals 2aFemale 2aLiverxchemistry 2aMale 2aSex Characteristics 2aTrace Elementsxanalysis 2aUrsidaexmetabolism 3aAlaska 3aBeaufort Sea 3aCanada 3aChukchi Sea 3aGreenland 0aAlaska1 aAgusa, Tetsuro 1 aEvans, Thomas J. 1 aTanabe, Shinsuke 0 tArchives of environmental contamination and toxicology.g2007 Oct., v. 53, no. 3 p.473-482dNew York : Springer-Verlagx0090-43417nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00244-007-0018-x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20070902b20071002c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle03031naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002100145245028300166300001800449520141800467650001601885650001501901650001601916650002201932650001001954650001801964650002101982650004302003650001602046650004402062650001102106650002802117650001202145650002902157650003002186653002502216653001802241700002002259700001802279773013802297852000902435856008502444930003302529946001102562655001202573IND4445575120221116183101.0101126e201012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444557512DNAL7 a10.1007/s00216-010-4255-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTardieu, Audrey 10aUsing one-dimensional (1D) and two-dimensional (2D) quantitative proton (¹H) nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (q NMR) for the identification and quantification of taste compounds in raw onion (Allium cepa L.) bulbs and in aqueous solutions where onion tissues are soaked  ap. 3139-3153.  aSolutions obtained by soaking onion (Allium cepa L.) bulbs samples in water are frequently consumed, either directly or as part of dishes, both at home or in the food industry. However, little information is available regarding the extracted metabolites and the extraction mechanisms. In this article, the composition of raw onion extracts and of aqueous solutions where raw onion tissues were soaked was investigated directly by quantitative proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (q ¹H NMR). The assignment of NMR signals was performed, with less than 3% (in area) of unidentified peaks. Analyses of one-dimensional ¹H NMR spectra with additional two-dimensional NMR studies showed 20 regions of interest where 3 saccharides, 17 amino acids, and 5 organic acids were detected and quantified. Resonance assignment with chemical shift was done for each saccharide, as well as for each amino acid and organic acid, with additional work on spin-spin coupling pattern and on observed and not observed correlations from correlation spectroscopy studies. Quantification of saccharides was performed and qualified by works on peak decomposition algorithms. Complementary studies by high-performance liquid chromatography, mass spectroscopy and tandem mass spectroscopy, and thin layer chromatography and preparative layer chromatography were carried out in order to validate the NMR results on identification. 3aAllium cepa 3aalgorithms 3aamino acids 3aaqueous solutions 3abulbs 3acarbohydrates 3aflavor compounds 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3ametabolites 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aonions 3aorganic acids and salts 3asoaking 3atandem mass spectrometry 3athin layer chromatography 0aQuantitative ¹H NMR 0aAllium cepa L1 aDe Man, Walter 1 aThis, Hervé.0 tAnalytical and bioanalytical chemistry.g2010 Dec., v. 398, no. 7-8 p.3139-3153dBerlin/Heidelberg : Springer-Verlagx1618-26427nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00216-010-4255-x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20101126b20101204c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03192naa a2200613 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024002800133040001800161100001600179245011200195300001600307500001500323506007600338520135800414506003701772650001101809650002201820650002401842650001901866650001201885650001801897650003301915650001101948650001401959650001801973650002201991650002102013650001502034650002702049650004002076650002602116650002802142650002302170650003202193650001702225651001302242653001102255653002402266653002502290700002102315700001602336700001602352773009102368852000902459856004102468930003302509945001302542946001102555655001202566IND2331346120221207075741.0030312e200205  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233134612DNAL7 a120995362pmid7 aPMC42338942pmcid7 a10.1093/aob/mcf0892doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPound, L.M.10aEarly ovule development following self- and cross-pollinations in Eucalyptus globulus Labill. ssp. globulus  ap. 613-620.  a2019-12-05  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe study was conducted to identify the self-incompatibility mechanism in Eucalyptus globulus ssp. globulus. Controlled self- and cross-pollinations were conducted on individual flowers from three mature trees that had self-incompatibility levels of 76, 99.6 and 100%. Flowers were harvested at 4, 6 and 8 weeks after pollination. Embryology was investigated by bright field microscopy on material harvested at 4 and 6 weeks after pollination. Fertilization had taken place at 4 weeks after pollination with zygotes and free nuclear endosperm visible. There was a greater proportion of healthy, fertilized ovules in the cross-compared with the self-pollination treatment, and approx, half the ovules examined from both pollen treatments were not fertilized or were degenerating. By 6 weeks after pollination a few zygotes were starting to divide. The number of healthy, fertilized ovules was still greater in the cross-pollination treatment, but the number of healthy fertilized ovules was lower in both treatments compared with 4 weeks after pollination, and many ovules were degenerating. Fertilized ovules were significantly larger than non-fertilized or degenerating ovules and this difference was detectable by eye at 6 and 8 weeks after pollination. The mechanism of self-incompatibility appears to have both late pre- and post-zygotic components.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aovules 3aplant development 3aEucalyptus globulus 3aembryo (plant) 3aflowers 3acell division 3afertilization (reproduction) 3azygote 3aendosperm 3aembryogenesis 3across pollination 3aself-pollination 2aAlgorithms 2aCell Sizexphysiology. 2aEucalyptusxembryologyxphysiology. 2aFertilityxphysiology 2aPlant Stemsxphysiology 2aPollenxphysiology 2aSeedsxgrowth & development 2aTime Factors 3aTasmania 0anuclei 0asexual reproduction 0aself incompatibility1 aWallwork, M.A.B.1 aPotts, B.M.1 aSedgley, M.0 tAnnals of botany.g2002 May, v. 89, no. 5 p.613-620wJournal:jnl44715x0305-73647nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/aob/mcf089  a20030508b20030509c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US 7aarticle03136naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024002800133040001800161100001700179245010500196300001600301500001500317506007600332520152600408506003701934650001701971650002101988650001202009650001402021650001502035650002502050650001202075650001302087650001002100650001102110650001102121650006002132650006102192650001702253650005802270653002202328653002102350700001602371700001902387773009302406852000902499856004102508930003302549945001302582946001102595655001202606IND2333424720221207075741.0030709e200209  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233342472DNAL7 a122341502pmid7 aPMC42404002pmcid7 a10.1093/aob/mcf2002doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aThomas, R.G.12aA developmentally based categorization of branching in Trifolium repens L.: influence of nodal roots  ap. 379-389.  a2019-12-05  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThis study describes the successive stages of development of branches from axillary buds in fully rooted plants of Trifolium repens grown in near optimal conditions, and the way in which this developmental pathway differs when nodal root formation is prevented as plants grow out from a rooted base. Cuttings of a single genotype were established in a glasshouse with nodal root systems on the two basal phytomers and grown on so that nodal rooting was either permitted (+R) or prevented (-R). In +R plants, axillary tissues could be assigned to one of four developmental categories: unemerged buds, emerged buds, unbranched lateral branches or secondarily branched lateral branches. In -R plants, branch development was retarded, with the retardation becoming increasingly pronounced as the number of -R phytomers on the primary stolon increased. Retarded elongation of the internodes of lateral shoots on -R plants resulted in the formation of a distinct fifth developmental category: short shoots (defined as branches with two or more leaves but with mean internode length equal to, or less than, 10% of that of the immediately proximal internode on the parent stolon) which had reduced phytomer appearance rates but retained the potential to develop into lateral branches. Transfer of +R plants to -R conditions, and vice versa, after 66 d demonstrated that subsequent branch development was wholly under the control of the youngest nodal root present, regardless of the age and number of root systems proximal to it.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aroot systems 3aTrifolium repens 3astolons 3abranching 3ainternodes 3abiochemical pathways 3arooting 3abranches 3aroots 3aleaves 3ashoots 2aPlant Rootsxanatomy & histologyxgrowth & development. 2aPlant Shootsxanatomy & histologyxgrowth & development. 2aTime Factors 2aTrifoliumxanatomy & histologyxgrowth & development. 0aplant development 0aplant morphology1 aHay, M.J.M.1 aNewton, P.C.D.0 tAnnals of botany.g2002 Sept., v. 90, no. 3 p.379-389wJournal:jnl44715x0305-73647nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/aob/mcf200  a20030903b20030905c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US 7aarticle03832naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024002800133040001800161100001600179245009900195300001600294500001500310506007600325520226900401506003702670650001602707650001102723650002202734650001102756650001802767650001402785650001002799650002102809650001602830650001502846650002602861650001002887650001102897650002202908650004302930650002102973651001702994651001703011653001103028700002303039700001703062773009203079852000903171856004103180930003303221945001303254946001103267655001203278IND2333365220221207075737.0030708e200207  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233336522DNAL7 a121257662pmid7 aPMC42338602pmcid7 a10.1093/aob/mcf1562doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMusil, C.F.10aEffects of elevated ultraviolet-B radiation on native and cultivated plants of southern Africa  ap. 127-137.  a2019-12-05  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aSeventeen herb, shrub and tree species of commercial and ecological importance in southern Africa were exposed at one location to ultraviolet-B (UV-B, 280-315 nm) radiation approx. 35 % above clear-sky background (control). The aims were to assess how UV-B affects canopy area, dry mass, and some biochemical and morphological properties of leaves, and to investigate whether differences between species are related to growth form of the plants. There was no pattern of response to UV-B related to growth form. Leaves of trees had altered chlorophyll a and b, carotenoid and flavonoid concentrations, but those of shrubs or herbs did not. Non-structural carbohydrates were unaffected. Smaller canopy areas and dry masses were observed under enhanced UV-B, but these were not statistically different among growth forms. There was a general insensitivity of species to elevated UV-B. Only five species had significantly altered leaf biochemical and morphological properties, canopy area and dry mass, the changes differing in magnitude. There was no consistent pattern of change in leaf thickness or biochemical composition with increased UV-B. Correlation analyses did not support the view that growth is less negatively affected in species with thick leaves or in those where leaf thickness increases, or in species with naturally high leaf flavonoid contents or that are able to synthesize additional flavonoids in response to UV-B enhancement. The analyses did not support the hypothesis that growth was inhibited by starch accumulation in leaves under elevated UV-B. However, changes in leaf shape did correlate with canopy area and dry mass, showing the importance of photomorphogenetic changes caused by UV-B which affect species' performance. We conclude that generalizations on plant sensitivity to UV-B based on growth form and functional type could be misleading, and that the great majority of economically important species of the region are likely to be insensitive to future UV-B increases. Notable exceptions include the Colophospermum mopane tree ecotypes chota and leslie and the arable annual Vigna unguiculata, both of which are traditional sources of livelihood to rural African populations and of importance to African industry and agriculture.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3achlorophyll 3acanopy 3aplant development 3ashrubs 3acarbohydrates 3aleaf area 3atrees 3aplant morphology 3acarotenoids 3aflavonoids 3aultraviolet radiation 3aforbs 3aleaves 2aPlant Development 2aPlantsxmetabolismxradiation effects. 2aUltraviolet Rays 3aSouth Africa 0aSouth Africa 0aplants1 aChimphango, S.B.M.1 aDakora, F.D.0 tAnnals of botany.g2002 July, v. 90, no. 1 p.127-137wJournal:jnl44715x0305-73647nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/aob/mcf156  a20030903b20030905c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US 7aarticle02744naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024002800133040001800161100001400179245004700193300001600240500008400256506007600340520107400416506003701490650001901527650002501546650001301571650001901584650001901603650002301622650001201645650001201657650001901669650001301688650001201701650001401713650001601727650003101743650001201774650001601786650003201802651001101834653002301845653001101868653001501879653003001894700001801924700001301942773009201955852000902047856004102056930003302097945001302130946001102143655001202154IND2332742620221207075714.0030523e200210  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233274262DNAL7 a123242782pmid7 aPMC42403882pmcid7 a10.1093/aob/mcf2222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGrace, J.10aImpacts of climate change on the tree line  ap. 537-544.  aPaper given at a meeting held September 10-12, 2001, St. Andrews, Scotland, UK.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe possible effects of climate change on the advance of the tree line are considered. As temperature, elevated CO2 and nitrogen deposition co-vary, it is impossible to disentangle their impacts without performing experiments. However, it does seem very unlikely that photosynthesis per se and, by implication, factors that directly influence photosynthesis, such as elevated CO2, will be as important as those factors which influence the capacity of the tree to use the products of photosynthesis, such as temperature. Moreover, temperature limits growth more severely than it limits photosynthesis over the temperature range 5-20 degrees C. If it is assumed that growth and reproduction are controlled by temperature, a rapid advance of the tree line would be predicted. Indeed, some authors have provided photographic evidence and remotely sensed data that suggest this is, in fact, occurring. In regions inhabited by grazing animals, the advance of the tree line will be curtailed, although growth of trees below the tree line will of course increase substantially.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aclimate change 3aenvironmental impact 3anitrogen 3aphotosynthesis 3aremote sensing 3aaerial photography 3aanimals 3agrazing 3acarbon dioxide 3atreeline 2aClimate 2aEcosystem 2aEnvironment 2aPhotosynthesisxphysiology 2aSeasons 2aTemperature 2aTreesxgrowth & development 0aEurope 0aliterature reviews 0agrowth 0adeposition 0acarbon dioxide enrichment1 aBerninger, F.1 aNagy, L.0 tAnnals of botany.g2002 Oct., v. 90, no. 4 p.537-544wJournal:jnl44715x0305-73647nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/aob/mcf222  a20030627b20030708c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US 7aarticle02679naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002800092024002200120024001900142040001800161100001600179245017400195300001600369500001500385506007600400520136700476506003701843650002201880650000901902650001401911650001101925650001901936650001801955650001201973650001201985650001101997653002102008700001602029773009302045852000902138856004102147930003302188945001302221946001102234655001202245IND2333425920221207075901.0030709e200209  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233342592DNAL7 a10.1093/aob/mcf1952doi7 aPMC42403952pmcid7 a122341542pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCline, M.G.12aA preliminary investigation of the role of auxin and cytokinin in sylleptic branching of three hybrid poplar clones exhibiting contrasting degrees of sylleptic branching  ap. 427-421.  a2019-12-05  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aSylleptic branches grow out from lateral buds during the same growing season in which the buds are formed. This type of branching is present in poplar and in many tropical species. It results in the production of more branches, more leaves and expanded photosynthetic capacity and is thought to assist in increasing the overall growth and biomass of the tree at a young age. However, very little is known about the physiology of sylleptic branching in poplar, which is an extremely important source of fibre and fuel. In the present study of three hybrid poplar clones (11-11, 47-174 and 49-177) of Populus trichocarpa X P. deltoides exhibiting contrasting degrees of sylleptic branching, an analysis was carried out on parent shoot elongation and sylleptic branching, together with a preliminary comparison of the parent shoots' sensitivity to auxin (naphthaleneacetic acid) as a repressor of lateral bud outgrowth, and cytokinin (benzyladenine) as a promoter. Suggestive evidence was found for an inverse correlation between parent shoot sensitivity to auxin and the degree of sylleptic branching, as well as a partially positive correlation with respect to sensitivity to cytokinin.

Endosperm removal and excision of root tips rapidly decreased the proline pool and greatly reduced proline accumulation in root tips at low water potential. Proline accumulation was not restored by exogenous amino acids. Labelling root tips with [14C]glutamate and [14C]proline showed that the rate of proline utilization (oxidation and protein synthesis) exceeded the rate of biosynthesis by five-fold at high and low water potentials. This explains the reduction in the proline pool following root and endosperm excision and the inability to accumulate proline at low water potential. The endosperm is therefore the source of the proline that accumulates in the root tips of intact seedlings. Proline constituted 10% of the amino acids released from the endosperm. [14C]Proline was transported from the scutellum to other parts of the seedling and reached the highest concentration in the root tip. Less [14C]proline was transported at low water potential but because of the lower rate of protein synthesis and oxidation, more accumulated as proline in the root tip. Despite the low biosynthesis capacity of the roots, the extent of proline accumulation in relation to water potential is precisely controlled by transport and utilization rate.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aroot tips 3aZea mays 3aisotope labeling 3aseedlings 3aproline 3aglutamates 3awater stress 3abiochemical pathways 3aendosperm 3aamino acid metabolism 0aroots1 aSmirnoff, N.0 tAnnals of botany.g2002 June, v. 89, no. 7 p.813-823wJournal:jnl44715x0305-73647nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/aob/mcf082  a20030903b20030905c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US 7aarticle03960naa a2200721 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024002800133040001800161100001900179245013300198300001600331500008400347500001500431506007600446520161200522506003702134650001502171650002502186650001202211650001802223650001402241650001702255650001702272650002202289650000702311650001902318650001502337650001402352650001002366650001702376650001902393650005202412650002202464650002902486650003902515650005002554650004202604650002902646650003802675650002502713650006002738650002002798650002502818650002702843650004302870650004002913653001302953653001402966653001102980700001702991700001903008773009203027852000903119856004103128930003303169945001303202946001103215655001203226IND2332742320221207075721.0030523e200210  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233274232DNAL7 a123242752pmid7 aPMC42403872pmcid7 a10.1093/aob/mcf2212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVirolainen, E.10aCa2+-induced high amplitude swelling and cytochrome c release from wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) mitochondria under anoxic stress  ap. 509-516.  aPaper given at a meeting held September 10-12, 2001, St. Andrews, Scotland, UK.  a2019-12-05  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aUnder stress conditions, mitochondria sense metabolic changes, e.g. in pH, cytoplasmic Ca(2+), energy status, and reactive oxygen species (ROS), and respond by induction of the permeability transition pore (PTP) and by releasing cytochrome c, thus initiating the programmed cell death (PCD) cascade in animal cells. In plant cells, the presence of all the components of the cascade has not yet been shown. In wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) root mitochondria, the onset of anoxia caused rapid dissipation of the inner membrane potential, initial shrinkage of the mitochondrial matrix and the release of previously accumulated Ca(2+). Ca(2+) uptake by mitochondria was dependent on the presence of inorganic phosphate. Treatment of mitochondria with high micromolar and millimolar Ca(2+) (but not Mg(2+)) concentrations induced high amplitude swelling, indicative of PTP opening. Alterations in mitochondrial volume were confirmed by transmission electron microscopy. Mitochondrial swelling was not sensitive to cyclosporin A (CsA)-an inhibitor of mammalian PTP. The release of cytochrome c was monitored under lack of oxygen. Anoxia alone failed to induce cytochrome c release from mitochondria. Oxygen deprivation and Ca(2+) ions together caused cytochrome c release in a CsA-insensitive manner. This process correlated positively with Ca(2+) concentration and required Ca(2+) localization in the mitochondrial matrix. Functional characteristics of wheat root mitochondria, such as membrane potential, Ca(2+) transport, swelling, and cytochrome c release under lack of oxygen are discussed in relation to PCD.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3ametabolism 3aanaerobic conditions 3acalcium 3aion transport 3amagnesium 3acytochrome c 3amitochondria 3aTriticum aestivum 3apH 3acell membranes 3aphosphates 3aapoptosis 3aroots 3apermeability 3ainorganic ions 2aBiological Transportxdrug effectsxphysiology. 2aBlotting, Western 2aCalcimycinxpharmacology 2aCalciumxmetabolismxpharmacology. 2aCytochrome c Groupxdrug effectsxmetabolism. 2aIntracellular Membranesxdrug effects 2aIonophoresxpharmacology 2aMembrane Potentialsxdrug effects 2aMicroscopy, Electron 2aMitochondriaxdrug effectsxmetabolismxultrastructure. 2aNADxmetabolism 2aOxygenxpharmacology 2aPhosphatesxmetabolism 2aPlant Rootsxdrug effectsxmetabolism. 2aTriticumxdrug effectsxmetabolism. 0aswelling 0acytoplasm 0astress1 aBlokhina, O.1 aFagerstedt, K.0 tAnnals of botany.g2002 Oct., v. 90, no. 4 p.509-516wJournal:jnl44715x0305-73647nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/aob/mcf221  a20030627b20030708c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US 7aarticle02602naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024002800133040001800161100001500179245006300194300001600257500001500273506007600288520096200364506003701326650001101363650002201374650001601396650002101412650001801433650002501451650001001476650001201486650001101498650002101509650003701530650002701567650005201594650002301646650002601669650003501695650006201730650003401792650002201826653001301848773009201861852000901953856004101962930003302003945001302036946001102049655001202060IND2333200220221207075743.0030624e200208  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233320022DNAL7 a121975132pmid7 aPMC42404232pmcid7 a10.1093/aob/mcf1802doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFricke, W.10aBiophysical limitation of cell elongation in cereal leaves  ap. 157-167.  a2019-12-05  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aGrass leaves grow from the base. Unlike those of dicotyledonous plants, cells of grass leaves expand enclosed by sheaths of older leaves, where there is little or no transpiration, and go through developmental stages in a strictly linear arrangement. The environmental or developmental factor that limits leaf cell expansion must do so through biophysical means at the cellular level: wall-yielding, water uptake and solute supply are all candidates. This Botanical Briefing looks at the possibility that tissue hydraulic conductance limits cell expansion and leaf growth. A model is presented that relates pathways of water movement in the elongation zone of grass leaves to driving forces for water movement and to anatomical features. The bundle sheath is considered as a crucial control point. The relative importance of these pathways for the regulation of leaf growth and for the partitioning of water between expansion and transpiration is discussed.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aturgor 3aplant development 3acell growth 3aosmotic pressure 3atranspiration 3aleaf water potential 3acells 3aPoaceae 3aleaves 3avascular bundles 2aBiological Transportxphysiology 2aCell Sizexphysiology. 2aEdible Grainxgrowth & developmentxphysiology. 2aModels, Biological 2aOsmolar Concentration 2aOsmotic Pressurexdrug effects 2aPlant Leavesxcytologyxgrowth & developmentxphysiology. 2aSodium Chloridexpharmacology 2aWaterxmetabolism 0apressure0 tAnnals of botany.g2002 Aug., v. 90, no. 2 p.157-167wJournal:jnl44715x0305-73647nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/aob/mcf180  a20030903b20030905c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US 7aarticle04321naa a2200913 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024002800133040001800161100001600179245006000195300001600255500008400271500001500355506007600370520146700446506003701913650001501950650001901965650001401984650001701998650001602015650001102031650002202042650002402064650001902088650001802107650001302125650001502138650002902153650002502182650002302207650003102230650005802261650002102319650005702340650001902397650003302416650002002449650001902469650002302488650002002511650002302531650007302554650003102627650005702658650005702715650006002772650002602832650002202858651001602880651002002896653001702916653001802933653001002951653002302961653002302984653001103007653002003018700001903038700001703057700001303074700001803087700001803105700002103123700001703144700001703161700001803178773009203196852000903288856004103297930003303338945001303371946001103384655001203395IND2332742520221207080033.0030523e200210  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233274252DNAL7 a123242772pmid7 aPMC42403742pmcid7 a10.1093/aob/mcf1712doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRaven, J.A.10aSeaweeds in cold seas: evolution and carbon acquisition  ap. 525-536.  aPaper given at a meeting held September 10-12, 2001, St. Andrews, Scotland, UK.  a2019-12-05  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aMuch evidence suggests that life originated in hydrothermal habitats, and for much of the time since the origin of cyanobacteria (at least 2.5 Ga ago) and of eukaryotic algae (at least 2.1 Ga ago) the average sea surface and land surface temperatures were higher than they are today. However, there have been at least four significant glacial episodes prior to the Pleistocene glaciations. Two of these (approx. 2.1 and 0.7 Ga ago) may have involved a 'Snowball Earth' with a very great impact on the algae (sensu lato) of the time (cyanobacteria, Chlorophyta and Rhodophyta) and especially those that were adapted to warm habitats. By contrast, it is possible that heterokont, dinophyte and haptophyte phototrophs only evolved after the Carboniferous-Permian ice age (approx. 250 Ma ago) and so did not encounter low (less than or equal to 5 degrees C) sea surface temperatures until the Antarctic cooled some 15 Ma ago. Despite this, many of the dominant macroalgae in cooler seas today are (heterokont) brown algae, and many laminarians cannot reproduce at temperatures above 18-25 degrees C. By contrast to plants in the aerial environment, photosynthetic structures in water are at essentially the same temperature as the fluid medium. The impact of low temperatures on photosynthesis by marine macrophytes is predicted to favour diffusive CO2 entry rather than a CO2-concentrating mechanism. Some evidence favours this suggestion, but more data are needed.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3amacroalgae 3acarbon dioxide 3aevolution 3aPhaeophyceae 3aChlorophyta 3acarbon 3awater temperature 3asexual reproduction 3aphotosynthesis 3aCyanobacteria 3ahabitats 3aRhodophyta 2aBicarbonatesxmetabolism 2aBiological Evolution 2aCarbonxmetabolism 2aCarbon Dioxidexmetabolism 2aChlorophytaxgrowth & developmentxradiation effects. 2aCold Temperature 2aCyanobacteriaxclassificationxgrowth & development. 2aEarth, Planet. 2aEukaryotic Cellsxphysiology 2aHot Temperature 2aMarine Biology 2aModels, Biological 2aOceans and Seas 2aOxygenxmetabolism 2aPhaeophytaxclassificationxgrowth & developmentxradiation effects. 2aPhotosynthesisxphysiology 2aPhytoplanktonxclassificationxgrowth & development. 2aRhodophytaxgrowth & developmentxradiation effects. 2aSeaweedxclassificationxphysiologyxradiation effects. 2aSymbiosisxphysiology 2aWaterxmetabolism 0aAntarctica. 0aArctic regions. 0aRhodophycota 0aChlorophycota 0aalgae 0aliterature reviews 0aalgae and seaweeds 0auptake 0aPhaeophycophyta1 aJohnston, A.M.1 aKubler, J.E.1 aKorb, R.1 aMcinroy, S.G.1 aHandley, L.L.1 aScrimgeour, C.M.1 aWalker, D.I.1 aBeardall, J.1 aClayton, M.N.0 tAnnals of botany.g2002 Oct., v. 90, no. 4 p.525-536wJournal:jnl44715x0305-73647nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/aob/mcf171  a20030627b20030708c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US 7aarticle02976naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024002800133040001800161100001700179245007600196300001600272500001500288506007600303520122400379506003701603650002801640650001301668650001301681650001601694650001401710650001201724650001101736650002101747650001601768650001101784650006801795650003201863650002101895650003401916650006701950650003102017650006202048650002302110653002402133653001902157700001802176700001702194773009202211852000902303856004102312930003302353945001302386946001102399655001202410IND2332741820221207080021.0030523e200210  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233274182DNAL7 a123242712pmid7 aPMC42403862pmcid7 a10.1093/aob/mcf2202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDavies, K.L.10aPseudopollen and food-hair diversity in Polystachya Hook.

The commonest type of trichome is uniseriate, two to four-celled, with a clavate or subclavate terminal cell. This type occurs amongst representatives of most sections examined. Other trichomes are bristle-like with tapering or fusiform terminal cells, whereas representatives of section Polystachya have uniseriate, moniliform trichomes that fragment with the formation of rounded or elliptical component cells. Most contain protein and, while some contain starch, lipid is invariably absent. The presence of particular types of labellar trichomes does not coincide with variations in vegetative morphology. Thus, current taxonomic treatment of the genus indicates that trichome types, with perhaps the sole exception of moniliform, pseudopollen-forming hairs found in section Polystachya only, have limited taxonomic value. However, the remarkable similarity between pseudopollen-forming hairs of Polystachya and those of the Neotropical genus Maxillaria in terms of morphology, cellular dimensions and food content indicates that pseudopollen may have arisen several times and evolved in response to similar pollinator pressures.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3ainterspecific variation 3aproteins 3ataxonomy 3apollinators 3atrichomes 3aflowers 3alipids 3aplant morphology 3aPolystachya 3apollen 2aCell Surface Extensionsxchemistryxphysiologyxultrastructure. 2aHistocytochemistryxmethods 2aLipid Metabolism 2aMicroscopy, Electronxmethods 2aOrchidaceaexgrowth & developmentxmetabolismxultrastructure. 2aPlant Proteinsxmetabolism 2aPollenxgrowth & developmentxmetabolismxultrastructure. 2aStarchxmetabolism 0aspecies differences 0amorphotaxonomy1 aRoberts, D.L.1 aTurner, M.P.0 tAnnals of botany.g2002 Oct., v. 90, no. 4 p.477-484wJournal:jnl44715x0305-73647nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/aob/mcf220  a20030627b20030708c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US 7aarticle03652naa a2200625 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024002800133040001800161100001600179245016700195300001600362506007600378520163200454506003702086650001802123650002102141650001602162650001202178650001402190650002202204650001602226650001502242650001802257650002502275650001802300650001402318650001602332650002102348650002502369650003602394650002202430650006502452650001402517650007102531650004902602650002302651650004002674650002402714651001102738651001102749700001902760700002202779700001402801773009202815852000902907856004102916930003302957945001302990946001103003655001203014IND2333209020221207080029.0030624e200208  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233320902DNAL7 a121975192pmid7 aPMC42404132pmcid7 a10.1093/aob/mcf1682doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBorba, E.L.10aFloral and vegetative morphometrics of five Pleurothallis (Orchidaceae) species: correlation with taxonomy, phylogeny, genetic variability and pollination systems  ap. 219-230.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aMorphometric analyses of vegetative and floral characters were conducted in 21 populations of five Pleurothallis (Orchidaceae) species occurring in Brazilian 'campo rupestre' vegetation. A phylogenetic analysis of this species group was also carried out using nuclear ribosomal DNA internal transcribed spacers (ITS1 and ITS2). Results of the ordination and cluster analyses agree with species' delimitation revealed by taxonomic and allozyme studies. The groups formed in ordination analysis correspond to the pollinator groups determined in a previous pollination study. Relationships among the species in the cluster analysis using only vegetative characters are similar to those found in a previous allozyme study, but those indicated by cluster analysis using only floral characters differ. These results support the hypothesis that floral similarities are due to convergence driven by similar pollination mechanisms, and therefore floral traits may not be good indicators of phylogenetic relationships in this group. The results of the phylogenetic analysis support this conclusion to some extent. There is no correlation between genetic (allozyme) and morphological variability in the populations nor in the way this variability is distributed among conspecific populations. We describe a new subspecies of Pleurothallis ochreata based on differences in vegetative and chemical characters as well as geographic distribution. Absence of differentiation in floral characters, attraction of the same pollinator species, interfertility and genetic similarity support the argument for subspecific rather than specific status.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aPleurothallis 3aplant morphology 3ameasurement 3aflowers 3aphylogeny 3agenetic variation 3apollination 3avegetation 3aribosomal DNA 3anucleotide sequences 3achemotaxonomy 3aallozymes 3apollinators 2aCluster Analysis 2aDNA, Plantxanalysis 2aDNA, Ribosomal Spacerxanalysis 2aGenetic Variation 2aOrchidaceaexclassificationxgeneticsxgrowth & development. 2aPhylogeny 2aPlant Leavesxanatomy & histologyxgeneticsxgrowth & development. 2aPlant Stemsxgeneticsxgrowth & development. 2aPollenxphysiology 2aReproductionxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aSpecies Specificity 3aBrazil 0aBrazil1 aShepherd, G.J.1 aBerg, C. van den,1 aSemir, J.0 tAnnals of botany.g2002 Aug., v. 90, no. 2 p.219-230wJournal:jnl44715x0305-73647nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/aob/mcf168  a20030903b20030905c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US 7aarticle02422naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024002800133040001800161100001900179245014400198300001600342506007600358520080600434506003701240650001101277650001901288650004401307650001901351650001701370650001401387650004401401650004401445650004101489650002101530650004001551650004501591650002501636650003101661650003501692700001401727773009201741852000901833856004101842930003301883945001301916946001101929655001201940IND2333210020221207080025.0030624e200208  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233321002DNAL7 a121975232pmid7 aPMC42404222pmcid7 a10.1093/aob/mcf1792doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGersbach, P.V.10aNon-invasive localization of thymol accumulation in Carum copticum (Apiaceae) fruits by chemical shift selective magnetic resonance imaging  ap. 253-257.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aMagnetic resonance imaging was used to localize the site of essential oil accumulation in fruit of Carum copticum L.

The presence of essential oil secretory structures in the fruit and an essential oil containing a high proportion of thymol were confirmed with optical microscopy and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, respectively. Selective imaging of whole C. copticum fruits showed that thymol accumulation was localized to the secretory structures (canals) situated in the fruit wall. The technique was considered non-invasive as the seeds used in the imaging experiments remained intact and viable.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3athymol 3ahistochemistry 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aessential oils 3aplant glands 3asecretion 2aCarumxchemistryxcytologyxmetabolism. 2aFruitxchemistryxcytologyxmetabolism. 2aGas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry 2aLipid Metabolism 2aMagnetic Resonance Imagingxmethods 2aMagnetic Resonance Spectroscopyxmethods 2aMicroscopy, Confocal 2aOils, Volatilexmetabolism 2aThymolxchemistryxmetabolism.1 aReddy, N.0 tAnnals of botany.g2002 Aug., v. 90, no. 2 p.253-257wJournal:jnl44715x0305-73647nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/aob/mcf179  a20030903b20030905c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US 7aarticle02777naa a2200313 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003200092040001800124100001700142245015700159300001600316520176800332650004302100650002502143650001202168650001902180653001102199700001502210700002302225773009202248852000902340856004502349930003302394945001302427946001102440655001202451IND2268062320221116182946.0010330e200006  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND226806232DNAL7 a10.1006/anbo.2000.11422doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVenema, J.H.10aAnalysis of low-temperature tolerance of a tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum) cybrid with chloroplasts from a more chilling-tolerant L. hirsutum accession  ap. 799-807.  aGrowth and photosynthesis of an alloplasmic tomato (cybrid), i.e. line AH47, containing the nuclear genome of the chilling-sensitive cytoplasmic albino mutant of L. esculentum Mill. ‘Large Red Cherry’ (LRC) and the plastome of a more chilling-tolerant high-altitude accession of the related wild species L. hirsutum Humb. & Bonpl. LA 1777, were investigated at an optimal (25/20°C) and suboptimal (16/14°C) day/night temperature regime and their performance compared with that of both euplasmic parents. The cybrid shoot had a similar biomass and development rate to the nuclear tomato (L. esculentum) parent at both temperature regimes. Compared with the biomass production of shoots grown at optimal temperature, the reduction in shoot biomass at suboptimal temperature was smaller for L. hirsutum than for L. esculentum and the cybrid. This difference was related to a stronger inhibition of leaf area expansion in L. esculentum and the cybrid in the suboptimal temperature regime than in L. hirsutum. Irrespective of the temperature regime under which the plants were grown, photosynthetic performance and leaf pigment, carbohydrate and soluble-protein contents of the cybrid resembled those of the nuclear parent. No advantages of the alien L. hirsutum chloroplast with respect to growth and photosynthesis-related characteristics were observed in the cybrid in the suboptimal temperature regime, indicating that the temperature sensitivity of the photosynthetic apparatus is regulated by nuclear genes. An adverse consequence of interspecific chloroplast transfer was the increased susceptibility to chill-induced photoinhibition of the cybrid. It is concluded that cybridization is not a useful tool for improving low-temperature tolerance of tomato. 3aSolanum lycopersicum var. lycopersicum 3aSolanum habrochaites 3acooling 3aphotosynthesis 0agrowth1 aEekhof, M.1 aHasselt, P.R. van.0 tAnnals of botany.g2000 June, v. 85, no. 6 p.799-807wJournal:jnl44715x0305-73647nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1006/anbo.2000.1142  a20010402b20010411c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US 7aarticle02998naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003200092040001800124100001700142245012200159300001600281500001500297520162000312650002101932650002801953650003601981650001202017650001702029650001102046650001302057650002302070650002302093650001302116650002402129650002402153650001002177650001102187653002402198653001402222653001102236653002302247700001602270700001502286773009202301852000902393856004502402930003302447945001302480946001102493655001202504IND2243482020221116182827.0010306e200004  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND224348202DNAL7 a10.1006/anbo.1999.10942doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBoldingh, H.10aSeasonal concentrations of non-structural carbohydrates of five Actinidia species in fruit, leaf and fine root tissue  ap. 469-476.  a2019-12-05  aTo characterize seasonal patterns of carbohydrate concentrations in Actinidia species from different natural habitats, leaf, fruit and fine root tissue samples from five species ( A. arguta , A. deliciosa , A. chinensis , A. polygama and A. eriantha ) were collected over one season, and analysed for fructose, glucose, sucrose, myo -inositol and starch concentrations. Sucrose and starch peaked in leaf tissue around flowering time. In fruit, hexose sugars and/or myo -inositol transiently increased early in development. Starch accumulated in fruit of all species, beginning sooner after anthesis in A. arguta and A. polygama than in the other species. Sucrose accumulation coincided with onset of net starch degradation in A. arguta but was delayed in the other species. At final fruit sampling, concentrations of glucose and fructose were greater than sucrose in all species except A. arguta . myo -Inositol concentrations constituted >10% of total sugars for most of the season in leaf and fruit tissues of all species except A. polygama . Fine roots of A. arguta and A. polygama contained significantly more starch and sucrose for most of the year than those of the other species. Observed differences in seasonal carbohydrate patterns may reflect different natural habitats, with A. arguta and A. polygama growing naturally in colder climates than the other species. Transient accumulation of sugars in fruit during early stages of development has been considered to act as primary osmoticum for cell expansion. However, the presence of only low sugar concentrations in A. eriantha questions this hypothesis. 3aActinidia arguta 3ainterspecific variation 3achemical constituents of plants 3aglucose 3amyo-inositol 3astarch 3ahabitats 3aseasonal variation 3aActinidia polygama 3afructose 3aActinidia chinensis 3aActinidia deliciosa 3aroots 3aleaves 0aspecies differences 0aActinidia 0afruits 0aactinidia eriantha1 aSmith, G.S.1 aKlages, K.0 tAnnals of botany.g2000 Apr., v. 85, no. 4 p.469-476wJournal:jnl44715x0305-73647nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1006/anbo.1999.1094  a20010402b20010411c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US 7aarticle02742naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003200092040001800124100002300142245012800165300001600293500001500309520144500324650001601769650001801785650002201803650002501825650002501850650001101875650001701886650002201903650001401925650002501939650001101964650001901975653001401994653001102008653002802019700001602047700001802063773009202081852000902173856004502182930003302227945001302260946001102273655001202284IND2256393820221116182600.0010328e200102  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND225639382DNAL7 a10.1006/anbo.2000.13192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKrauter-Canham, R.10aSF21 is a protein which exhibits a dual nuclear and cytoplasmic localization in developing pistils of sunflower and tobacco  ap. 241-249.  a2019-12-05  aSF21 was originally described as a pollen- and pistil-expressed protein from sunflower and tobacco. In pistils excised from these species, transcripts were detected in the stigma and in the transmitting tissue where they accumulated in an ovary-oriented increasing concentration gradient. We studied the cellular localization of the SF21 protein during various stages of pistil development as well as in pollen grains of tobacco and sunflower. Here we demonstrate that in young tobacco pistils (from stage 2 onwards) this protein is expressed exclusively in the papillae and secretory cells of the stigma where it is located first in the nucleus and subsequently also in the cytoplasm. Only several stages later (stage 10) does it appear in the transmitting tissue cells of the style where it exhibits a similar, but temporally-delayed, dual nuclear and cytoplasmic localization pattern. SF21 is no longer present in either the stigma or style at the time of pollination, indicating that it is not directly involved in the pollination process. In tobacco pollen grains, SF21 appears just prior to pollen germination and localizes to the apical region of growing pollen tubes, suggesting a possible role in pollen tube growth. This temporal and spatial expression pattern as well as the dual nuclear/cytoplasmic localization suggest that SF21 could be involved in several molecular functions during pistil development and pollen tube growth. 3apollination 3amessenger RNA 3aHelianthus annuus 3aimmunohistochemistry 3aamino acid sequences 3astigma 3apollen tubes 3aNicotiana tabacum 3acytoplasm 3anucleotide sequences 3apollen 3aplant proteins 0agynoecium 0anuclei 0amolecular sequence data1 aBronner, R.1 aSteinmetz, A.0 tAnnals of botany.g2001 Feb., v. 87, no. 2 p.241-249wJournal:jnl44715x0305-73647nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1006/anbo.2000.1319  a20010402b20010411c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US 7aarticle02778naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003200092040001800124100001800142245015100160300001600311500001500327520132500342650002101667650001801688650001401706650001701720650001101737650001401748650001501762650001701777650002201794650002401816650002301840650002601863650001801889650002601907650002101933650001001954650001001964651001601974653002101990653001102011700001802022700001702040773009202057852000902149856004502158930003302203945001302236946001102249655001202260IND2256392020221116182636.0010328e200102  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND225639202DNAL7 a10.1006/anbo.2000.13202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBaumann, D.T.10aEffects of intercropping on growth and reproductive capacity of late-emerging Senecio vulgaris L., with special reference to competition for light  ap. 209-217.  a2019-12-05  aDue to increased emphasis on long-term management of weed populations in cropping systems with a reduced reliance on herbicides, the production of seeds by weeds that emerge after the critical period for weed control is increasingly important. It was hypothesized that increased soil cover and light interception by a crop canopy would shorten the critical period for weed control and reduce growth and fecundity of late-emerging weeds. This hypothesis was tested in a series of field and glasshouse experiments in which competition for light was manipulated. Senecio vulgaris, an important weed in vegetable production systems, was chosen as the target plant, and canopies of pure and mixed stands of leek and celery were used to provide shade. The time course of light interception differed among the crop canopies. Increasing competition for light caused morphological changes to S. vulgaris, including a vertical shift in leaf area distribution. Increased shading reduced biomass, capitula:shoot ratio and seed production of S. vulgaris. However, the viability of seeds produced by the shaded weed plants was not affected. Results indicate that intercropping can increase light interception in a weakly competitive crop such as leek and can contribute to weed suppression in a long-term strategy for weed management. 3aSenecio vulgaris 3aAllium porrum 3aviability 3aweed control 3acanopy 3afecundity 3asoil depth 3aburied seeds 3aseed productivity 3asexual reproduction 3aseedling emergence 3afield experimentation 3aintercropping 3acrop-weed competition 3aApium graveolens 3alight 3acrops 3aSwitzerland 0acropping systems 0agrowth1 aBastiaans, L.1 aKropff, M.J.0 tAnnals of botany.g2001 Feb., v. 87, no. 2 p.209-217wJournal:jnl44715x0305-73647nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1006/anbo.2000.1320  a20010402b20010411c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US 7aarticle02350naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001900145245004900164300001600213520096200229650001101191650002001202650002301222650002201245650002901267650001401296650002001310650001601330650001601346650001701362650001001379650000901389653001001398653002201408653003201430653008401462700002201546700002101568700002401589700002001613773010901633852000901742856008501751930003301836946001101869655001201880IND4423354220221116182958.0090718e200908  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442335422DNAL7 a10.1007/s11104-009-9929-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHodge, Angela 10aPlant root growth, architecture and function  ap. 153-187.  aWithout roots there would be no rhizosphere and no rhizodeposition to fuel microbial activity. Although micro-organisms may view roots merely as a source of carbon supply this belies the fascinating complexity and diversity of root systems that occurs despite their common function. Here, we examine the physiological and genetic determinants of root growth and the complex, yet varied and flexible, root architecture that results. The main functions of root systems are also explored including how roots cope with nutrient acquisition from the heterogeneous soil environment and their ability to form mutualistic associations with key soil micro-organisms (such as nitrogen fixing bacteria and mycorrhizal fungi) to aid them in their quest for nutrients. Finally, some key biotic and abiotic constraints on root development and function in the soil environment are examined and some of the adaptations roots have evolved to counter such stresses discussed. 3acarbon 3aedaphic factors 3amicrobial activity 3amycorrhizal fungi 3anitrogen-fixing bacteria 3anutrients 3arhizodeposition 3arhizosphere 3aroot growth 3aroot systems 3aroots 3asoil 0aAuxin 0aRoot architecture 0aAbiotic and biotic stresses 0aSoil micro-organisms (including nitrogen-fixing bacteria and mycorrhizal fungi)1 aBerta, Graziella 1 aDoussan, Claude 1 aMerchan, Francisco 1 aCrespi, Martin 0 tPlant and soil.g2009 Aug., v. 321, no. 1-2 p.153-187dDordrecht : Springer Netherlandsx0032-079X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11104-009-9929-93Available from publisher's Web site  a20090718b20090801c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02310naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002600152245007700178300001600255520099100271650002101262650001001283650002201293650002201315650001601337650001101353650001301364650001801377650002501395650001401420650001601434651000901450653002501459653000901484700003201493700002501525700001801550700002101568773013001589852000901719856009201728930003301820946001101853655001201864IND4422954020221116182803.0090710e200908  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442295402DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1439-0434.2008.01518.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMīrzāyī, Suhaylā.10aGenetic and Phenotypic Diversity among Botrytis cinerea Isolates in Iran  ap. 474-482.  aForty-four Botrytis cinerea isolates from different hosts and geographical regions were studied for colony morphology, mycelial growth rate at different temperatures, pathogenicity and molecular diversity. Botrytis cinerea isolates had temperature optima of 20-25°C and isolates showed variation in growth rate at different temperatures. Two morphological types were identified among tested isolates: mycelial and sclerotial. The pathogenicity of isolates was tested on grapevine leaves, and it was revealed that nine of 44 isolates were non-pathogenic and among them seven were of mycelial type. There was no correlation between mycelium growth rate and pathogenicity. Genetic diversity was investigated using nine arbitrary decaprimers. No relationship was found between molecular clusters and geographical region or sampling time; whereas isolates from the same plant host tended to cluster with each other. Seven of nine non-pathogenic isolates were separated from pathogenic ones. 3aBotrytis cinerea 3aVitis 3aavirulent strains 3agenetic variation 3ahost plants 3aleaves 3amycelium 3apathogenicity 3aphenotypic variation 3asclerotia 3atemperature 3aIran 0amycelial growth rate 0aRAPD1 aMohammadi Goltapeh, Ebrahim1 aShams-Bakhsh, Masoud1 aSafaie, Naser1 aChaichi, Mehrdad0 tPhytopathologische Zeitschrift.g2009 Aug., v. 157, no. 7-8 p.474-482dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0931-17857nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1439-0434.2008.01518.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20100715b20100807c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03358naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002200152245008900174300001600263520174400279650002202023650002402045650001902069650001502088650001302103650001402116650000902130650002402139650002702163650001902190650001602209650001102225650002102236650001602257650001702273650002002290650001002310650002502320650001302345653001602358653001802374653001702392653002502409700002402434700001802458700002202476700003002498773013102528852000902659856009202668930003302760946001102793655001202804IND4423272420221116182849.0090718e200908  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442327242DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1461-9563.2009.00432.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStaley, Joanna T.10aFertilizer affects the behaviour and performance of Plutella xylostella on brassicas  ap. 275-282.  a1 Foliar nitrogen concentration, which can be manipulated in crop plants by fertilizer supply, has long been recognized as a major factor in phytophagous insect abundance and performance. More recently, the type of fertilizer supplied has been shown to influence the abundance of some herbivore species. The diamondback moth Plutella xylostella is a global pest of Brassica crops. Although it has been the subject of numerous studies on host-plant resistance and pest control, few studies have addressed the effect of abiotic factors, such as nutrient supply, on its performance and behaviour. 2 We assessed oviposition preference, larval feeding preference and larval performance of P. xylostella on two cultivars of Brassica oleracea. Plants were grown using two fertilizer types, John Innes fertilizer and an organic animal manure, at high and low concentrations. 3 Plutella xylostella laid more eggs on cultivar Derby Day than Drago. Derby Day was also the cultivar on which larval performance was maximized. However, differences in larval performance between cultivars were only found when plants were grown in compost with John Innes fertilizer, and not when fertilized with animal manure. 4 Foliar nitrogen concentration was greater in plants grown in high fertilizer treatments but did not differ between cultivars. The concentrations of three glucosinolate compounds (glucoiberin, sinigrin and glucobrassicin) were greater in the high fertilizer treatments. Glucosinolate concentrations were higher in the Drago than the Derby Day cultivar. 5 These results are discussed in relation to the preference-performance hypothesis, and the assessment of plant resistance differences between cultivars using different types of fertilizer. 3aBrassica oleracea 3aPlutella xylostella 3aanimal manures 3acole crops 3acomposts 3acultivars 3aeggs 3afeeding preferences 3afertilizer application 3aglucobrassicin 3aglucoiberin 3alarvae 3anitrogen content 3aoviposition 3apest control 3apest resistance 3apests 3aphytophagous insects 3asinigrin 0aglucoiberin 0aglucosinolate 0apupal weight 0arelative growth rate1 aStewart-Jones, Alex1 aPoppy, Guy M.1 aLeather, Simon R.1 aWright, D.

Compared with fast drying, slow drying of the ABA-treated embryos improved desiccation tolerance. However, slow drying of non-ABA-treated embryos led to the complete loss of germination capacity, while some fast-dried embryos survived. An electron paramagnetic resonance spin probe technique and in vivo Fourier transform infrared microspectroscopy revealed that cellular membrane integrity and alpha-helical protein secondary structure were maintained during drying in embryos cultured in media enriched with 20 micromolar ABA, but not in embryos cultured in the absence of ABA. Slow-dried, non-ABA-treated embryos had low oligosaccharide to sucrose ratios, an increased proportion of beta-sheet protein secondary structures and broad membrane phase transitions extending over a temperature range of more than 60 degrees C, suggestive of irreversible phase separations. The spin probe study showed evidence of imbibitional damage, which could be alleviated by prehydration in humid air. These observations emphasize the importance of appropriate drying and prehydration protocols for the survival and storage of somatic embryos. It is suggested that ABA also plays a role in suppressing metabolism, thus increasing the level of desiccation tolerance; this is particularly evident under stressful conditions such as slow drying.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3ametabolism 3agermination 3adevelopmental stages 3aMedicago sativa 3acotyledons 3asomatic embryogenesis 3acell membranes 3astorage 3aabscisic acid 3amortality 2aAbscisic Acidxpharmacology 2aCarbohydrate Metabolism 2aCell Membranexdrug effects 2aDesiccationxmethods 2aElectron Spin Resonance Spectroscopyxmethods 2aFerricyanidesxpharmacology 2aGerminationxphysiology 2aMedicagoxdrug effectsxembryologyxphysiology. 2aOligosaccharidesxmetabolism 2aPlant Growth Regulatorsxpharmacology 2aSeedsxdrug effectsxphysiology. 2aSpectroscopy, Fourier Transform Infraredxmethods 2aSucrosexmetabolism 2aTriacetoneamine-N-Oxylxpharmacology 2aWaterxpharmacology 0atolerance 0aembryo (plant)1 aWolkers, W.F.1 aHoekstra, F.A.1 aBewley, J.D.0 tAnnals of botany.g2002 Apr., v. 89, no. 4 p.391-400wJournal:jnl44715x0305-73647nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/aob/mcf057  a20030508b20030509c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US 7aarticle03955naa a2200853 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024002800133040001800161100001700179245010600196300001600302500001500318506007600333520156400409506003701973650001402010650001502024650001102039650001602050650001102066650001402077650001502091650000902106650001802115650001102133650001202144650002002156650001102176650001102187650001302198650001202211650001402223650001902237650002102256650002102277650001202298650000902310650002702319650001402346650002002360650001302380650002302393650002202416650002302438650004202461650003102503650003502534650002302569650002502592650002102617650003102638650004502669650002402714650003002738650002002768650002102788651001202809653001302821653001402834653000802848653001502856700001902871773009202890852000902982856004102991930003303032945001303065946001103078655001203089IND2331029720221207055013.0030226e200204  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233102972DNAL7 a120967962pmid7 aPMC42338672pmcid7 a10.1093/aob/mcf0522doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHodson, M.J.10aX-ray microanalytical studies of mineral localization in the needles of white pine (Pinus strobus L.)  ap. 367-374.  a2019-12-05  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aEastern white pine (Pinus strobus L.) shoots from mature trees were collected from two sites of contrasting soil pH: the Glendon campus of York University in Toronto, Ontario (pH 6.7 at 40 cm); and Muskoka near Huntsville, Ontario (pH 4.2 at 40 cm). Needles of ages 1-3 years were removed from the shoots, and the percentage of ash and silica was determined for all ages. Other needles were frozen in liquid nitrogen and kept in a cryo-biological storage system before x-ray microanalysis. Percentages of ash and silica were higher in the needles from Muskoka. Ash and silica increased with needle age for trees from the Muskoka site, but less so at the Toronto site. Of the 13 elements (Na, Mg, Al, Si, P, S, Cl, K, Ca, Mn, Fe, Cu and Zn) detected by microanalysis, Mn, Fe, Cu and Zn were detected in small amounts in the epidermis, endodermis and transfusion tissue (the layer of tracheids and parenchyma immediately surrounding the vascular bundles), and K, P, S and Cl were almost ubiquitous in distribution. Sodium was occasionally detected in the transfusion tissue, and magnesium was concentrated in the endodermal cells. The epidermal walls, transfusion tissue and endodermis were major sites of calcium localization. Silicon was concentrated in the extreme tips of the needles in all tissues, but particularly in the transfusion tissue, and more so in the Muskoka samples. Microanalysis revealed a higher Al content in the Muskoka needles, that Al was concentrated in the needle tips and that the transfusion tissues were major sites of accumulation.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3amanganese 3aphosphorus 3ashoots 3aX-radiation 3asulfur 3atracheids 3acell walls 3airon 3aPinus strobus 3asodium 3asoil pH 3amineral content 3asilica 3acopper 3achlorine 3acalcium 3apotassium 3ahistochemistry 3avascular bundles 3acryopreservation 3asilicon 3azinc 3ageographical variation 3amagnesium 3aconifer needles 3aaluminum 2aAluminumxanalysis 2aCalciumxanalysis 2aChlorinexanalysis 2aElectron Probe Microanalysisxmethods 2aHydrogen-Ion Concentration 2aMicroscopy, Electron, Scanning 2aMineralsxanalysis 2aPhosphorusxanalysis 2aPinusxchemistry 2aPlant Epidermisxchemistry 2aPlant Leavesxchemistryxultrastructure. 2aPotassiumxanalysis 2aSilicon Dioxidexanalysis 2aSoilxanalysis. 2aSulfurxanalysis 3aOntario 0aleaf age 0aepidermis 0aash 0aparenchyma1 aSangster, A.G.0 tAnnals of botany.g2002 Apr., v. 89, no. 4 p.367-374wJournal:jnl44715x0305-73647nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/aob/mcf052  a20030508b20030509c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US 7aarticle02990naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002900111040001800140072001700158100002400175245005200199300001800251520120900269650002501478650001201503650001301515650001801528650001001546650001101556650002101567650001301588650001401601650004901615650003501664650003401699650002101733650002001754650003801774650001701812650002201829650003101851650004301882650001401925650003301939650001501972650004901987650004702036653001402083653001502097700002702112700001902139773007302158852000902231856007902240930003302319945002502352946001102377655001202388IND4415769120221116182125.0090203e20080228xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441576912DNAL7 a182729672pmid7 a10.1038/nature065572doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aRavi, Maruthachalam10aGamete formation without meiosis in Arabidopsis  ap. 1121-1124.  aApomixis, the formation of asexual seeds in plants, leads to populations that are genetically uniform maternal clones. The transfer of apomixis to crop plants holds great promise in plant breeding for fixation of heterozygosity and hybrid vigour because it would allow the propagation of hybrids over successive generations. Apomixis involves the production of unreduced (diploid) female gametes that retain the genotype of the parent plant (apomeiosis), followed by parthenogenetic development of the egg cell into an embryo and the formation of functional endosperm. The molecular mechanisms underlying apomixis are unknown. Here we show that mutation of the Arabidopsis gene DYAD/SWITCH1 (SWI1) a regulator of meiotic chromosome organization, leads to apomeiosis. We found that most fertile ovules in dyad plants form seeds that are triploid and that arise from the fertilization of an unreduced female gamete by a haploid male gamete. The unreduced female gametes fully retain parental heterozygosity across the genome, which is characteristic of apomeiosis. Our results show that the alteration of a single gene in a sexual plant can bring about functional apomeiosis, a major component of apomixis. 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3amutants 3amutation 3agametogenesis 3agenes 3aovules 3aseed development 3aapomixis 3atriploidy 2aArabidopsisxcytologyxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aArabidopsis Proteinsxgenetics 2aCell Cycle Proteinsxgenetics 2aCrosses, Genetic 2aGenetic Markers 2aGerm Cellsxcytologyxphysiology. 2aHeterozygote 2aMeiosisxgenetics 2aNuclear Proteinsxgenetics 2aParthenogenesisxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aPhenotype 2aPlants, Genetically Modified 2aPolyploidy 2aReproduction, Asexualxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aSeedlingsxcytologyxgeneticsxphysiology. 0aSWI1 gene 0aapomeiosis1 aMarimuthu, Mohan P.

Oxidative stress plays a significant role in the initiation and progression of hepatocellular damage and possibly in the development of HCC in HCV infected patients. In vitro, animal and clinical studies suggest that lycopene, a nonprovitamin A carotenoid and a potent antioxidant, may attenuate the liver injury and possibly prevent the development of HCC. In this article, we discuss the relationship between HCV infection and oxidative stress and review the potential role of lycopene in the treatment of HCV and prevention of HCC. 3acarcinogenesis 3ain vivo studies 3aantiviral properties 3ahepatoma 3anutritional intervention 3aHepatitis C virus 3adisease prevention 3alycopene 3afree radical scavengers 3aanimal models 3ain vitro studies 3aantioxidant activity 3aoxidative stress 3aanticarcinogenic activity 0aantioxidants1 aMutchnick, Milton1 aHutchinson, Daryl1 aHarmanci, Ozgur1 aBayraktar, Yusuf1 aMutchnick, Sean1 aŞahin, Kazım.1 aKucuk, Omer0 tNutrition and cancer.g2008 , v. 60, no. 6 p.729-735x0163-55817nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/016355808024197723Available from publisher's Web site  a20090310b20090508c00000000  aINDdPNNe2009/03/10  aOther US 7aarticle00958naa a2200265 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001800145245008900163300001800252500002400270520015100294650001400445650001000459650001200469651001100481700002200492773010900514852000900623856004800632655001200680IND4432699420221116182041.0100213e200912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443269942DNAL7 a10.1134/S00138738090900732doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLabina, E.

Micronized fluorescent dusts were used as marking agents and analysis used the Fisher-Ford model: the assumptions of this model are justified using evidence from this study and the literature. Survival rates were commonly 0.45-0.85 per day, suggesting that mean life expectancy for adult flies is from 1.3 to 6.2 days in natural populations.

To quantify the spatial distribution and vertical stacking of lithofacies within an outer-platform shoal-barrier complex, integrated facies analysis and digital field technologies have been applied to a high-relief carbonate platform exposed in the Djebel Bou Dahar (Lower Jurassic, High Atlas, Morocco). The outer platform is characterized by subtidal, cross-bedded, coarse grainstone to rudstone grading into supratidal, pisoidal packstone-rudstone with tepees that together formed a 350 to 420 m wide shoal-barrier belt parallel to the margin. This belt acted as a topographic high separating a restricted lagoon from the subtidal, open marine region. Low-energy tidal flats developed on the protected flank of the barrier facing the lagoon. Lithofacies patterns were captured quantitatively from outcrop and integrated into a digital outcrop model. The outcrop model enabled rapid visualization of field data and efficient extraction of quantitative data such as widths of facies belts. In addition, the spatial heterogeneity was captured in multiple time slices, i.e. during different phases of cyclic base-level fluctuations. In general, the lateral continuity of lithofacies is highest when relative water depth increased during flooding of the platform top, establishing low-energy subtidal conditions across the whole platform, and when the accommodation space was filled with tidal flat facies. Heterogeneity increased during deposition of the relief-building bar facies that promoted spatial diversification of depositional environments during the initial phases of accommodation space creation. Cycles commonly are composed of a thin transgressive tidal flat unit, followed by coated-grain rudstone bar facies. Lateral to the bar facies, pisoidal-grainstone beach deposits accumulated. These bar and beach deposits were overlain by subtidal lagoonal facies or would grow through the maximum flooding and highstand. There the bars either graded into supratidal pisoidal facies with tepees (when accommodation space was filled) or were capped by subaerial exposure (due to a sea-level fall). Modified embedded Markov analysis was used to test the presence of common ordering in vertical lithofacies stacking in a stationary interval (constant depositional mode). Analysis of individual sections did not reveal any ordering, which may be related to the limited thickness of these sections. Composite sections, however, rejected the null hypothesis of randomness. The addition of stratigraphically significant information to the Markov analysis, such as exposure surfaces and lateral dimensions of facies bodies, strengthens the verdict of unambiguous preferential ordering. Through careful quantitative reconstruction of stratal geometry and facies relationships in fully integrated digital outcrop models, accurate depositional models could be established that enhanced the predictability of carbonate sediment accumulation. 3aMorocco 0aCarbonate outer-platform 0adigital outcrop model 0aJurassic 0ashoal-barrier facies1 aPORTA, GIOVANNA DELLA1 aMERINO-TOMÉ, OSCAR1 aKENTER, JEROEN A.M.0 tSedimentology.g2009 Oct., v. 56, no. 6 p.1801-1831dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0037-07467nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-3091.2009.01058.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20090918b20091106c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle01418naa a2200265 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100001700115245004500132300001200177520070800189650001700897650001200914650002100926650003900947650001800986773007301004852000901077939003301086945000801119946001301127655001201140991589813340742620221116182515.0880126e19860918xx ||||go|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI870026202DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSugarman, C.10aUSDA seeks to improve school lunch menus  ap. 4-5.  aA highlighted summary of a recent newspaper report discusses a USDA program aimed at revamping the school lunch program's cookbook for the first time in 15 years. The program includes the creation of about 10 new, thoroughly tested recipes, the use of spices to replace salt, consideration of the new American Heart Association guidelines, and the creative use of commodity foods. It is argued that the revisions should be more meaningful to small and medium-sized schools rather than to larger schools that have the technical support to make their own changes in the standardized recipes. It is concluded that the ultimate success of the recipes will depend on acceptability by the school children.(wz) 3aschool lunch 3arecipes 3ahealth promotion 3agovernmental programs and projects 3amenu planning0 tNutrition week.g1986 Sept. 18, v. 16, no. 37 p.4-5x0736-00967nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19880126c00000000  aFNC  aOther US 7aarticle01262naa a2200265 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100001800115245004700133300001400180520052700194650002200721650002100743650002100764651000900785653003400794773009300828852000900921939003300930945000800963946001300971655001200984991589813160742620221116182524.0880208e198612  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI870027322DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSimmons, P.H.12aA unique model for community food pantries  ap. 43-45.  aA brief report describes a unique community-based program that provides free food, nutrition education, senior citizen home delivery, remedial education, homemaking classes, and a library to low-income elderly.

The analysis of Cu levels was done by an electro thermal atomic absorption spectrometry (ETAAS) method developed. The criteria for the validation of the method [sample recoveries, repeatability, limit of detection, sensibility and analyses of the standard reference materials (BCR CRM 063R and CRM 185R)] demonstrated its reliability and accuracy. The total Cu supply by meals is directly and significantly (P < 0.001) correlated with their macronutrient contents. The mean total and dialyzable Cu levels were 314.0 ± 123.2 μg and 84.19 ± 50.96 μg, respectively. The mean dialysis Cu percentage was 25.95 ± 15.70%. The total and dialyzable Cu levels and dialysis Cu percentages (Cu bioaccesability) found in breakfasts were significantly lower (P < 0.001). The dialysis Cu levels enhance significantly with the total element contents. The dialysis Cu levels and dialysis Cu percentages present in meals were primary and significantly correlated with carbohydrates, fibre, P, Fe, cholesterol, protein and several amino acids (P < 0.01). Food like cereals, legumes and dry fruits are primary sources of bioaccesible Cu in the diet. The protein and derivate amino acids, previous digestion, form soluble complexes with Cu in the gastrointestinal tract enhancing significantly the element bioavailability. Dialyzable Cu levels and dialysis Cu percentages enhanced significantly with corresponding Cr levels of meals (P = 0.001). The mean Cu daily dietary intake (DDI) found was 941.5 μg/day. The method of duplicate diet sampling and analysis of Cu facilitates the most accurate and reliable results and considers the influence of technological and cooking processes. The Cu DDIs reported indicate that probably no problems in relation to Cu nutrition could be observed in usual consumers of these meals (users and staff of the hospital). 3aamino acids 3aatomic absorption spectrometry 3abioavailability 3abreakfast 3acarbohydrates 3acholesterol 3adetection limit 3adialysis 3adiet 3adigestion 3afruits 3agastrointestinal system 3agrain foods 3ahospitals 3alegumes 3aproteins 3areference standards 0aCu 0aETAAS 0aDuplicate diets 0aIn vitro availability1 aNavarro-Alarcon, Miguel1 aLópez-Ga de la Serrana, Herminia1 aPerez-Valero, Vidal1 aLopez-Martinez, María C.0 tEuropean food research & technology.g2008 June, v. 227, no. 2 p.367-373dSpringer-Verlagx1438-23777nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00217-007-0730-9 7aarticle02842naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127100001900144245020000163300001600363520136000379650001801739650003001757650001601787650002301803650002101826650002001847650001701867650001601884650002301900650002101923650001501944650001601959650001101975650002501986650002402011650001202035650002002047700002202067700002002089700001902109700002402128700001802152773008802170852000902258930003302267945002502300946001102325655001202336IND4420383420221116182229.0090512s2009    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442038342DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Using a combination of laboratory, common garden and fieldwork we studied biology, ecology and host range of C. scrobicollis, a univoltine species that oviposits and develops in A. petiolata rosettes in fall and spring. Individual C. scrobicollis can be long-lived (>2 years) and females show a second oviposition period. Weevils did not attack any of 31 test plant species outside the Brassicaceae. Within the Brassicaceae, five species allowed complete larval development under no-choice conditions. In subsequent choice tests, three of these five species (Nasturtium officinale, Peltaria alliacea and Thlaspi arvense; which are of European origin) were attacked. North American Rorippa sinuata was the only native species to be attacked by C. scrobicollis and only under no-choice conditions. Results of subsequent impact experiments showed that C. scrobicollis attack changed plant architecture but had no effect on overall plant vigour and reproductive output of R. sinuata, suggesting lack of impact on demography or population dynamics. A petition for field release of C. scrobicollis in North America has been submitted. 3aCeutorhynchus 3abiological control agents 3aplant pests 3aAlliaria petiolata 3ainvasive species 3abroadleaf weeds 3aweed control 3aoviposition 3ainsect development 3ahost specificity 3ahost range 3ahost plants 3alarvae 3aenvironmental impact 3apopulation dynamics 3aRorippa 3arisk assessment1 aCortat, Chislaine1 aHinz, Hariet L.1 aBlossey, Bernd1 aKatovich, Elisabeth1 aSkinner, Luke0 tBiocontrol science and technology.g2009, v. 19, no. 1-2 p.117-138x0958-31577nnas  aDNAL  a20090624b20090703c00000000  aINDd2CTe2009/05/26  aNon-US 7aarticle02810naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127072001700144072001700161100001600178245013300194300001600327520141500343650001501758650001601773650003001789650002001819650001701839650001001856650001501866650001001881650001301891650001101904650002301915650001601938650001401954650001401968650001401982650001001996650002302006650001202029653001302041653002202054653002002076700001802096773008802114852000902202930003302211945002502244946001102269655001202280IND4420383520221116182331.0090512s2009    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442038352DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

This is an indigenous, gregarious, ecto-pupal parasitoid of certain dipteran insects, including the tachinid fly, Exorista bombycis (Louis) which is a well-known endo-larval parasitoid of the silkworm, Bombyx mori. Each gravid N. thymus female was allowed to parasitise 1-4-day-old puparia of Musca domestica L. for 2 days at a parasitoid-host ratio of 1:20. The parasitised host puparia were observed for progeny recovery, sex ratio, female longevity and fitness (adult size). In addition, reproductive performance of the parasitoid progeny was assessed by allowing its females to parasitise for 2 days, 3-day-old puparia of E. bombycis at a parasitoid-host ratio of 1:4. There was a significant negative correlation between host age and parasitisation rate, parasitoid developmental duration, sex ratio and female longevity while the correlation was positive between host age and parasitoid recovery per host puparium. Similarly, negative correlation was observed between host age and morphometric parameters (body length, head width and wing span of male and female and length and width of female abdomen) of the progeny adults. Host age did not have any impact on the reproductive performance of progeny adults when allowed to parasitise puparia of E. bombycis. 3aEulophidae 3aparasitoids 3abiological control agents 3aMusca domestica 3ainsect pests 3ahosts 3aanimal age 3apupae 3aExorista 3alarvae 3abiological control 3aBombyx mori 3asilkworms 3asex ratio 3alongevity 3avigor 3ainsect development 3afemales 0ahost age 0aExorista bombycis 0aNesolynx thymus1 aManjunath, D.0 tBiocontrol science and technology.g2009, v. 19, no. 1-2 p.139-149x0958-31577nnas  aDNAL  a20090625b20090703c00000000  aINDd2CTe2009/05/26  aNon-US 7aarticle01224naa a2200313 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100001800115245005700133300001200190500001500202520040700217650001000624650002300634650002000657650002000677650001500697653001900712653001700731700001900748773006800767852000900835939003300844945000800877946001300885655001200898991589811480742620221116182122.0880210e198501  xx ||||go|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI870027492DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWhitney, E.N.10aSome factors affecting the nutrient content of foods  ap. 6-7.  a2019-12-04  aA brief authoritative synopsis summarizes and discusses various factors affecting the nutrient content of foods.

Many studies in experimental animals including subhuman primates indicate that PEM elicits a prominent increase in the free histidine pool in several tissues. Associated with the latter is a marked elevation in brain content of histamine. There is also evidence of increased levels of histamine in the peripheral tissues. Histamine is considered to be a neuroregulatory substance, interacting with other neurotransmitters in several neuroendocrine and vegetative responses, a claim recently strengthened by the identification of histaminergic neurons in the central nervous system. This vasoactive amine is also classically associated with various pathologic processes including allergy, anaphylaxis and severe stress. Some subpopulations of lymphocytes have surface receptor sites for histamine, and studies indicate that this biogenic amine impairs various parameters of the immune system, especially cell-mediated immunity. There is therefore a need for evaluation of the possible contributions of increased body burden of histamine to the impaired immune responses seen in malnourished children.(author) 3ahistidine 3aprotein energy malnutrition 3ametabolic diseases 3ahistamine 3achildren 3aimmunity 0aliterature reviews0 tNutrition research.g1986 Mar., v. 6, no. 3 p.337-348x0271-53177nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19880209c00000000  aFNC  aOther US 7aarticle03709naa a2200673 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003100111040001800142072001700160100001700177245019700194300001600391500001500407520164800422650003702070650001602107650002302123650001502146650001502161650002002176650001902196650001102215650001702226650002002243650001002263650002002273650002302293650000802316650001802324650002302342650003202365650002002397650001402417650002302431650005302454650001002507650001502517650001102532650004002543650002402583650001102607650001502618650000902633650002202642650002902664653002202693653001302715700002302728773011102751852000902862856008102871930003302952945002502985946001303010655001203023IND4415044620221116182201.0090120e200902  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441504462DNAL7 a191063252pmid7 a10.3945/jn.108.0927262doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

In the post-folic acid fortification period, associations between plasma tHcy and demographic, health, and lifestyle factors and B vitamin status were investigated. Data from the 3 recent NHANES cycles (1999-2004) were used to study the associations among plasma tHcy and sex, race/ethnicity, age, BMI, blood pressure (BP), serum creatinine, serum cotinine, vitamin/mineral supplement use, and folate and cobalamin status in 16,254 persons (8329 men, 7925 women). Multivariate-adjusted plasma tHcy was ~9.7% higher in men than in women (P < 0.0001), ~5.3% higher in non-Hispanic whites than in non-Hispanic blacks (P < 0.0001), ~64.5% higher in individuals aged greater-than-or-equal60 y than in individuals aged <20 y (P < 0.0001), and ~5% higher in supplement nonusers than in supplement users (P < 0.0001). Persons in the 4th quartile for serum creatinine, serum cotinine, systolic BP, and serum methylmalonic acid (MMA) had ~36.1, ~13.4, ~5.6, and ~16.2%, respectively, higher tHcy than those in the 1st quartile (P < 0.0001). Plasma tHcy was inversely associated with serum folate (P < 0.0001), RBC folate (P < 0.0001), and serum cobalamin (P < 0.0001). In the post-folic acid fortification period, sex, race/ethnicity, age, systolic BP, supplement use, RBC folate, and serum creatinine, cotinine, folate, and cobalamin are significant determinants of plasma tHcy. Serum MMA was strongly associated with plasma tHcy. 3asociodemographic characteristics 3avitamin B12 3amethylmalonic acid 3acreatinine 3afolic acid 3afortified foods 3ablood pressure 3aadults 3ahomocysteine 3ablood chemistry 3awomen 3arisk assessment 3atemporal variation 3amen 3ahealth status 3aethnic differences 3avitamin-mineral supplements 3abody mass index 3alifestyle 3agender differences 3aNational Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2aAdult 2aDemography 2aFemale 2aFolic Acidxadministration & dosage 2aHomocysteinexblood 2aHumans 2aLife Style 2aMale 2aNutrition Surveys 2aVitamin B Complexxblood 0avitamin B complex 0acotinine1 aKafai, Mohammad R.0 tJournal of nutrition.g2009 Feb., v. 139, no. 2 p.345-352dAmerican Society for Nutritionx0022-31667nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3945/jn.108.0927263Available from publisher's Web site  a20090316b20090508c00000000  aINDd2CTe2009/03/01  aOther US 7aarticle03010naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003100111040001800142072001700160100003000177245005100207300001600258520155000274650001101824650001801835650001601853650001601869650001701885650001601902650002101918650001901939650002101958650002301979650001502002650001002017650004202027650001102069650001102080650000902091650001102100650000902111650003202120700001902152700001902171700001802190773011102208852000902319856008102328930003302409945002502442946001302467655001202480IND4415045320221116181944.0090120e200902  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441504532DNAL7 a191063122pmid7 a10.3945/jn.108.0961232doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aViskaal-van Dongen, Mirre10aHidden Fat Facilitates Passive Overconsumption  ap. 394-399.  aFood intake regulation may be disturbed when sensory signals from foods are disconnected from their metabolic properties. Consumption of high-fat, energy-dense foods may stimulate passive overconsumption, because these foods do not provide sensory signals in accordance with the actual nutrient content. We examined the effects of perception of fat on energy intake in adults after overfeeding (Study 1) and on energy intake during a meal (Study 2). In study 1, 57 participants consumed 6 mandatory lunches differing in energy level (100, 200, and 300% of a standard lunch intake) and fat condition (visible fat and hidden fat). Ad libitum energy intake was measured during subsequent meals. In Study 2, 51 participants consumed 2 lunches that were high in visible or hidden fats. We measured ad libitum energy intake during lunch. In Study 1, the energy intake at dinner was 8% higher in the hidden fat condition than in the visible fat condition (P = 0.0046). A main effect was also found for the energy level of the lunch (P < 0.0001), with the highest intake following the 100% energy level and the lowest intake following the 300% energy level. In Study 2, the energy intake was 9% higher in the hidden fat condition than in the visible fat condition (P = 0.013). Perception of fat influences energy intake. In the presence of visible fats, energy intake was lower than in the presence of hidden fats, suggesting that hidden fats may contribute to overconsumption. Appropriate sensory signals may be important in preventing overconsumption. 3aadults 3aenergy intake 3adietary fat 3aoverfeeding 3ameals (menu) 3afood intake 3afood composition 3aenergy density 3anutrient content 3aad libitum feeding 2aAdolescent 2aAdult 2aDietary Fatsxadministration & dosage 2aEating 2aFemale 2aFood 2aHumans 2aMale 2aSurveys and Questionnaires.1 aGraaf, Cees de1 aSiebelink, Els1 aKok, Frans J.0 tJournal of nutrition.g2009 Feb., v. 139, no. 2 p.394-399dAmerican Society for Nutritionx0022-31667nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3945/jn.108.0961233Available from publisher's Web site  a20090316b20090508c00000000  aINDd2CTe2009/03/01  aOther US 7aarticle03245naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001500151245017800166300001600344520187100360650002002231650003102251650001702282650001802299650001002317650001402327650001702341650001702358650001602375650001602391650002702407650003002434650001102464650001202475650001402487650001202501651001002513700002202523700002702545700002202572773014402594856005202738852000902790655001202799IND60535737720221116181836.0160805e201607  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053573772DNAL7 a10.1080/14620316.2016.11553172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNaresh, P.10aGenetic inheritance and identification of a resistance gene analogue polymorphic (RGAP) marker linked to Chilli veinal mottle virus resistance in chilli (Capsicum annuum L.)  ap. 285-291.  aChilli veinal mottle virus (ChiVMV) is a most destructive virus, which causes severe yield losses in pepper. Host plant resistance is the only option to tackle this problem. Eleven ChiVMV-resistant lines were selected from an initial screening of chilli pepper germplasm and their resistance was reconfirmed by artificial inoculation. To understand the genetic basis of inheritance and to identify a resistance gene analogue polymorphic (RGAP) marker associated with resistance, the ChiVMV-resistant chilli pepper line ‘IHR 2451’ (Parent 1) was crossed with the ChiVMV-susceptible line ‘IHR 3476’ (Parent 2) to develop six generations. Individual plants from all six generations (35 P1, 50 P1, 30 F1, 200 F2, 44 B1, and 41 B2) were artificially inoculated with ChiVMV (Bengaluru isolate) and the pattern of segregation of susceptibility or resistance was investigated using the chi-square (χ2) test. All F1 progeny plants were susceptible to ChiVMV. The pattern of segregation of resistant and susceptible plants in the F2 and two back-cross generations (B1 and B2) revealed that resistance in ‘IHR 2451’ was monogenic recessive. A total of 108 RGAP primer combinations were used to search for parental (P1 and P2) polymorphisms, and three polymorphic RGAP markers, K5-HD6, K7-HD6, and K8-HD6, were found by bulk segregant analysis. Use of the K5-HD6 marker was extended to screen individual plants in the F2 and B1 generations and was found to co-segregate with ChiVMV resistance. Furthermore, K5-HD6 was validated in different ChiVMV-resistant lines, where it could clearly differentiate between resistant and susceptible lines. The RGAP marker K5-HD6 could differentiate homozygous resistant plants from susceptible plants, and therefore may be used effectively during marker-assisted selection and breeding of chilli pepper for resistance to ChiVMV. 3aCapsicum annuum 3aChilli veinal mottle virus 3abackcrossing 3abiotechnology 3agenes 3agermplasm 3ahomozygosity 3ahorticulture 3ahost plants 3ahot peppers 3ainheritance (genetics) 3amarker-assisted selection 3apepper 3aprogeny 3ascreening 3aviruses 3aIndia1 aReddy, M.

For in vitro screening of the antiviral effect, haemagglutination activities of four different lactic acid bacterial strains by direct contact with virus were measured. L. plantarum KFCC11389P only neutralized the virus on the SPF eggs. For in vivo studies, four groups of chickens were fed with various L. plantarum KFCC11389P bacterial components and were then challenged with LPAI virus at 28 days. Additionally, two control groups were used as negative (virus-unchallenged) control and positive (virus-challenged) control. We show that some parameters such as nitric oxide production in serum and splenic adherent cells and interferon-γ levels in splenic cells from SPF chickens could be used for the evaluation of LPAI virus infection. This is the first report demonstrating the interferon-γ production in cultured splenic mononuclear cells and nitric oxide production in serum as well as virus shedding in trachea and cloacae in LPAI virus-infected SPF chickens fed specific lactic acid bacterial components. 3achickens 3ahemagglutination 3asimulation models 3aspecific pathogen-free animals 3ablood chemistry 3anitric oxide 3aexperimental design 3amonocytes 3aInfluenza A virus 3aLactobacillus plantarum 3aprobiotics 3asplenocytes 3aavian influenza 3atrachea (vertebrates) 3acloaca 3aoral administration 3ainterferons 2aAnimals 2aChickensxvirology 2aHemagglutination Tests 2aInfluenza A Virus, H9N2 Subtypexdrug effectsxpathogenicity. 2aInfluenza in Birdsxvirology 2aInterferon-gammaxmetabolism 2aLactobacillus plantarumxphysiology 2aNitric Oxidexmetabolism 2aOseltamivirxpharmacology 2aOvumxvirology 2aSpecific Pathogen-Free Organisms 2aSpleenxmetabolism 2aViral Load 0apathogen shedding 0aimmune response1 aChoi, Byungryul1 aJeong, Gajin1 aMo, Inpil0 tAvian pathology.g2008 Dec., v. 37, no. 6 p.593-597x0307-94577nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/030794508024390563Available from publisher's Web site  a20090311b20090508c00000000  aINDd2CTe2009/02/13  aNon-US 7aarticle01943naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127072001700145072001700162100002600179245011200205300001800317520075100335650002201086650001701108650001901125650001701144650002201161650001301183650001001196650001101206650001101217650001301228700002601241773011301267852000901380856008501389930003301474945002501507946001301532655001201545IND4415270820221116182457.0090123e200811  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441527082DNAL7 a10.1080/001036208024326832doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aFageria, N.K.10aScreening Upland Rice Genotypes for Manganese-use Efficiency  ap. 2873-2882.  aManganese (Mn) deficiency in upland rice grown after common bean or soybean, which received adequate rate of liming on highly weathered Oxisols, is observed. A greenhouse experiment was conducted to evaluate Mn-use efficiency of 10 promising upland rice genotypes. The genotypes were grown on an Oxisol at 0 mg Mn kg-1 (natural soil Mn level) and 20 mg Mn kg-1 of soil applied as manganese sulfate. Grain yield, panicle number, and grain harvest index (GHI) were significantly (P < 0.01) influenced by genotype. However, shoot dry weight was significantly affected by Mn as well as genotype treatments. Manganese uptake in the shoot as well as in the grain was also affected by genotype treatment. On the basis of Mn-use efficiency (mg grain weight/mg Mn accumulated in shoot and grain), genotypes were classified as efficient and responsive (ER), efficient and nonresponsive (ENR), nonefficient and responsive (NER), and nonefficient and nonresponsive (NENR). Genotypes Carisma, CNA8540, and IR42 were classified as ER, and genotypes CNA8557 and Maravilha were classified as ENR. Genotype Caipo was in the group NER, and in the NENR group were genotypes Bonana, Canastra, Caraja, and Guarani. From a practical point of view, genotypes that produce high grain yield at a low level of Mn and respond well to Mn additions are the most desirable because they are able to express their high yield potential in a wide range of Mn availability. 3anutrient use efficiency 3amanganese 3aOryza sativa 3anutrient uptake 3agrain yield 3ashoots 3aweight 3acultivars 3aOxisols 3aplant micronutrients 3agenotype 3aBrazil 0ashoot dry weight1 aBarbosa Filho, M.P.1 aMoreira, A.0 tCommunications in soil science and plant analysis.g2008 Nov., v. 39, no. 19-20 p.2873-2882x0010-36247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/001036208024327903Available from publisher's Web site  a20090204b20090301c00000000  aINDdLYNe2009/02/03  aOther US 7aarticle02033naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127072001700145072001700162100002200179245005400201300001800255520096600273650001201239650000901251650001501260650002301275650002701298651001601325700003201341700002001373773011301393852000901506856008501515930003301600945002501633946001301658655001201671IND4415272520221116182348.0090123e200811  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441527252DNAL7 a10.1080/001036208024328732doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Zinc sorption by the soils, adjusted to different pH values, was measured from various initial solution Zn concentrations in the presence of 0.01 M calcium nitrate [Ca(NO3)2]. Zinc desorption isotherms were derived from the cumulative Zn desorbed (μg g-1 soil) after each of 10 desorption periods by sequentially suspending the same soil samples in fresh Zn-free 0.01 M Ca(NO3)2. Zinc sorption and desorption varied widely with soil pH. Desorption of both native and added Zn decreased continuously with rising pH and became very low at pH values greater than 6.5. The proportion of sorbed Zn that could be desorbed back into solution decreased substantially as pH increased to more than 5.5. However, there were differences between soils regarding the extent of the hysteresis effect. 3asoil pH 3azinc 3adesorption 3asorption isotherms 3achemical concentration 3aNew Zealand1 aMcLaren, R.

The objective in this study was to assess levels of connectedness in the genetic evaluation of weaning weight among Targhee and Suffolk flocks participating in the US National Sheep Improvement Program (NSIP). Among flocks currently participating in the NSIP, a total of 25,404 weaning weight and 35,794 pedigree records were available for 16 Targhee flocks, and 14,017 weaning weight and 18,311 pedigree records were available for 24 Suffolk flocks. Connectedness was measured by using 2 different methods. First, numbers of progeny with recorded weaning weights from linking sires (defined as sires with progeny in multiple flocks or sires born in one flock with progeny in another flock) were counted. Second, connectedness was measured by calculating the average prediction error correlation of mean flock EBV (flock rij). Benchmarks for flock rij were established, with 0.10 and 0.05 representing low and moderate risk of bias associated with comparing EBV among flocks, respectively. From 1995 through 2004, 44% of Targhee lambs with weaning weights were born to linking sires; in Suffolk lambs, that value was 23%. In 1990, 1995, and 2005, average flock rij were 0.10, 0.19, and 0.28, respectively, among Targhee flocks, and 0.02, 0.02, and 0.04, respectively, among Suffolk flocks that participated in NSIP in all 3 yr. Among all active flocks in 2005, flock rij averaged 0.13 in Targhees and 0.03 in Suffolks. Hierarchical clustering of flocks based on flock rij revealed that all active Targhee flocks connected at a level near or above 0.10. In Suffolk flocks, 2 distinct clusters had formed, in which connectedness was relatively high within each cluster (flock rij near 0.10) but was near zero between clusters. Risk of bias in comparing EBV among flocks in the Targhee was low; however, caution should be exercised when comparing EBV between Suffolk flocks from different clusters. 3asheep 3aflocks 3abreeding value 3aTarghee 3aSuffolk (sheep breed) 3aweaning weight 3apedigree 3asires 3agenetic distance 3agenetic variation 2aAnimals 2aBody Weight 2aBreeding 2aCluster Analysis 2aFemale 2aMale 2aReproductionxphysiology 2aSheepxgenetics 3aUnited States 0aUnited States 0agenetic connectedness1 aLewis, R.M.1 aNotter, D.R.0 tJournal of animal science.g2009 Feb., v. 87, no. 2 p.507-515dAmerican Society of Animal Sciencex0021-88127nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2527/jas.2008-10923Available from publisher's Web site  a20090413b20090508c00000000  aINDd2CTe2009/03/24  aOther US 7aarticle04683naa a2200769 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003100111040001800142072001700160072001700177072001700194100001800211245012500229300001600354500001500370520239100385650002302776650001602799650001102815650002002826650002002846650001202866650001302878650001802891650000902909650002202918650001602940650001902956650001802975650002102993650002703014650001603041650001603057650002303073650001803096650002203114650003103136650001203167650002803179650003303207650002803240650002103268650002303289650001103312650004303323650002903366650003303395650002803428650004603456653002003502653001303522653002103535700001703556700001303573700001703586700001803603773011903621852000903740856008103749930003303830945002503863946001303888655001203901IND4415405220221116182024.0090123e200902  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441540522DNAL7 a189970632pmid7 a10.2527/jas.2008-08872doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aBelsito, K.R.10aImpact of ovariohysterectomy and food intake on body composition, physical activity, and adipose gene expression in cats  ap. 594-602.  a2019-12-04  aThe mechanisms contributing to BW gain following ovariohysterectomy in domestic cats are poorly understood. Moreover, the effects of food restriction to maintain BW following spaying have been poorly studied. Thus, our primary objective was to determine the effects of spaying and food restriction to maintain BW on adipose and skeletal muscle mRNA abundance and activity levels in cats. After a 4-wk baseline period (wk 0), 8 adult (approximately 1.5 yr old) domestic shorthair cats were spayed and fed to maintain BW for 12 wk. After 12 wk, cats were fed ad libitum for an additional 12 wk. Body composition was determined, activity levels were measured, and adipose and muscle biopsies were collected at wk 0, 12, and 24. Fasting blood samples were collected at wk 0, 6, 12, 18, and 24. To maintain BW post-spay, food intake was decreased (P < 0.05) by 30%. During this phase, mRNA abundance of adipose tissue lipoprotein lipase and leptin was decreased (P < 0.05), representing only 52 and 23% of baseline expression, respectively. Interleukin-6 mRNA, however, was increased (P < 0.05) 2-fold. Physical activity was decreased (P < 0.05) by wk 12, most dramatically during the dark period (approximately 20% of baseline activity). During ad libitum feeding (wk 12 to 24), food intake, BW, body fat percentage, and total fat mass were greatly increased (P < 0.05). Compared with wk 0, circulating leptin concentrations tended to increase (P < 0.10) by wk 18 and 24 (4.45 vs. 10.02 and 9.14 ng/mL, respectively), whereas glucose (91 vs. 162 mg/dL) and triacylglyceride (30 vs. 48 mg/dL) concentrations were increased (P < 0.05) by wk 24. Adipose tissue lipoprotein lipase, hormone sensitive lipase, and adiponectin mRNA were decreased (P < 0.05) at wk 24. Adipose interleukin-6 mRNA was increased (P < 0.05) at 24 wk. Physical activity was further decreased (P < 0.05) by wk 24, during the light (60% of baseline) and dark (33% of baseline) periods. In summary, spaying and food restriction affect physical activity levels and several genes associated with lipid metabolism (decreased lipoprotein lipase), food intake (decreased leptin expression), and insulin insensitivity (increased interleukin-6). By identifying these changes, targets for nutritional intervention or lifestyle management have been identified that may curb the risk of obesity and related disorders in spayed cats. 3alipoprotein lipase 3aadiponectin 3aleptin 3askeletal muscle 3agene expression 3aspaying 3abody fat 3amessenger RNA 3acats 3aphysical activity 3abody weight 3aadipose tissue 3ablood glucose 3atriacylglycerols 3atriacylglycerol lipase 3afeed intake 3aweight gain 3arestricted feeding 3ainterleukin-6 3adiurnal variation 2aAdipose Tissuexmetabolism 2aAnimals 2aBlood Chemical Analysis 2aBody Compositionxphysiology 2aBody Weightxphysiology 2aCatsxphysiology 2aEatingxphysiology 2aFemale 2aGene Expression Regulationxphysiology 2aHysterectomyxveterinary 2aMuscle, Skeletalxmetabolism 2aOvariectomyxveterinary 2aPhysical Conditioning, Animalxphysiology 0ablood chemistry 0ahormones 0abody composition1 aVester, B.M.1 aKeel, T.1 aGraves, T.K.1 aSwanson, K.S.0 tJournal of animal science.g2009 Feb., v. 87, no. 2 p.594-602dAmerican Society of Animal Sciencex0021-88127nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2527/jas.2008-08873Available from publisher's Web site  a20090413b20090508c00000000  aINDd2CTe2009/03/24  aOther US 7aarticle04004naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003100111040001800142072001700160072001700177072001700194100002000211245008300231300001600314500001500330520244400345650001602789650001202805650001402817650001202831650001902843650002002862650001602882650001702898650001402915650002402929650001702953650001602970650001202986650001802998650002103016650001103037650003303048650000903081650002203090653001003112700001403122700002203136773011903158852000903277856008103286930003303367945002503400946001303425655001203438IND4415404920221116182243.0090123e200902  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441540492DNAL7 a189527402pmid7 a10.2527/jas.2008-09492doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

In Exp. 1, the effect of 24 cereals vs. a common reference diet containing white rice on feed preference in pigs was studied. Pigs were offered free choice between the reference diet and a diet with the cereal under study for 4 d. Barley, corn (2 sources), wheat, cassava meal, biscuit meal, rye, sorghum, and 1 source of oats were tested at inclusion rates of 300 and 600 g·kg⁻¹. Short-grain rice (whole, brown, or extruded white), long-grain white rice (raw and cooked), extruded barley, extruded corn, extruded wheat, oats (2 sources), thick rolled oats, cooked oats, and naked oats (raw, extruded, or micronized) were tested at inclusion rates of 150, 300, and 600 g·kg⁻¹. Relative preference of cereals (% of total feed intake) was affected by type of cereal and by rate of inclusion. The diets containing extruded rice (150 g·kg⁻¹), extruded naked oats (150, 300, and 600 g·kg⁻¹), or naked oats (150 and 300 g·kg⁻¹) were preferred (P < 0.05) by pigs to the reference diet. However, the reference diet was preferred (P < 0.05) to the diets containing 150, 300, and 600 g·kg⁻¹ of cooked long-grain rice, oats, or cooked oats, 300 and 600 g·kg⁻¹ of extruded wheat, wheat, corn, sorghum, or unhulled short-grain rice, and 600 g·kg⁻¹ of thick rolled oats, extruded corn, rye, extruded barley, micronized naked oats, barley, cassava, or biscuit meal. Extrusion improved (P < 0.05) preference values for corn and naked oats by pigs, but had no effect on barley, rice, or wheat. In Exp. 2, the preferences of pigs for oats and barley were studied using mash and pelleted diets. Diet form did not affect preference in oats diets. However, for barley, greater preference values were obtained when measured in pelleted form compared with mash form. Additionally, direct 2-way choices were also performed between oats and barley diets and between diets presented in mash and pelleted forms. Pigs preferred barley to oats, and preferred diets presented in pelleted form to those presented in mash form. In conclusion, cereal type, inclusion rate, and diet form affected feed preference in pigs. Using cereals with greater preference values may contribute to the formulation of more palatable feeds, which enhance feed intake of piglets at critical stages such as weaning time. 3afeed grains 3apiglets 3amash feed 3aweaning 3apelleted feeds 3afeed processing 3afeed intake 3apalatability 3aextrusion 3afeeding preferences 3afeed rations 2aAnimal Feed 2aAnimals 2aEdible Grain. 2aDietxveterinary 2aFemale 2aFood Preferencesxphysiology 2aMale 2aSwinexphysiology 0aswine1 aRoura, E.1 aTorrallardona, D.0 tJournal of animal science.g2009 Feb., v. 87, no. 2 p.562-570dAmerican Society of Animal Sciencex0021-88127nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2527/jas.2008-09493Available from publisher's Web site  a20090413b20090508c00000000  aINDd2CTe2009/03/24  aOther US 7aarticle03394naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003100111040001800142072001700160072001700177100001600194245008700210300001600297520186000313650001402173650001802187650002002205650001502225650004402240650001302284650002102297650001602318650002002334650002002354650002502374650004402399650003002443650001202473650003302485653002302518653002202541700001702563700002802580773011902608852000902727856008102736930003302817945002502850946001302875655001202888IND4415407120221116181941.0090123e200902  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441540712DNAL7 a189527312pmid7 a10.2527/jas.2008-12972doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aWeary, D.M.10aBOARD-INVITED REVIEW: Using behavior to predict and identify ill health in animals  ap. 770-777.  aWe review recent research in one of the oldest and most important applications of ethology: evaluating animal health. Traditionally, such evaluations have been based on subjective assessments of debilitative signs; animals are judged ill when they appear depressed or off feed. Such assessments are prone to error but can be dramatically improved with training using well-defined clinical criteria. The availability of new technology to automatically record behaviors allows for increased use of objective measures; automated measures of feeding behavior and intake are increasingly available in commercial agriculture, and recent work has shown these to be valuable indicators of illness. Research has also identified behaviors indicative of risk of disease or injury. For example, the time spent standing on wet, concrete surfaces can be used to predict susceptibility to hoof injuries in dairy cattle, and time spent nuzzling the udder of the sow can predict the risk of crushing in piglets. One conceptual advance has been to view decreased exploration, feeding, social, sexual, and other behaviors as a coordinated response that helps afflicted individuals recover from illness. We argue that the sickness behaviors most likely to decline are those that provide longer-term fitness benefits (such as play), as animals divert resources to those functions of critical short-term value such as maintaining body temperature. We urge future research assessing the strength of motivation to express sickness behaviors, allowing for quantitative estimates of how sick an animal feels. Finally, we call for new theoretical and empirical work on behaviors that may act to signal health status, including behaviors that have evolved as honest (i.e., reliable) signals of condition for offspring-parent, inter- and intra-sexual, and predator-prey communication. 3alivestock 3aanimal health 3aanimal behavior 3aprediction 3asigns and symptoms (animals and humans) 3aaccuracy 3afeeding behavior 3afeed intake 3aanimal diseases 3aanimal injuries 2aAnimal Communication 2aAnimal Diseasesxdiagnosisxpsychology. 2aAnimal Husbandryxmethods 2aAnimals 2aBehavior, Animalxphysiology 0aliterature reviews 0asickness behavior1 aHuzzey, J.M.1 avon Keyserlingk, M.A.G.0 tJournal of animal science.g2009 Feb., v. 87, no. 2 p.770-777dAmerican Society of Animal Sciencex0021-88127nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2527/jas.2008-12973Available from publisher's Web site  a20090413b20090508c00000000  aINDd2CTe2009/03/24  aOther US 7aarticle04390naa a2200757 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003100111040001800142072001700160072001700177100001500194245007400209300001600283520223200299650001402531650001902545650001402564650002502578650002402603650001402627650002402641650000902665650001802674650002002692650002402712650002102736650001202757650001402769650002302783650002102806650001902827650002102846650001302867650001502880650001702895650003902912650001202951650001102963650003102974650002903005650001103034650002603045650003703071650000903108650001403117650001903131650002103150650002403171650002503195650001003220650002003230653002303250653002203273653002803295700001703323773011903340852000903459856008103468930003303549945002503582946001303607655001203620IND4415407520221116182535.0090123e200902  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441540752DNAL7 a188201522pmid7 a10.2527/jas.2008-13752doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aLoor, J.J.10aASAS Centennial Paper: Lactation biology for the twenty-first century  ap. 813-824.  aKnowledge of general aspects of mammary gland function, including metabolic pathways and hormonal regulation of mammary gland development and lactation, in livestock species was obtained several decades ago. As basic biological information of growth factor action, apoptotic mechanisms, and signal transduction events has exploded, the mouse became the model of choice for studying fundamental mechanisms regulating mammary function. A complete sequenced genome also has made the mouse amenable for studies of mammary gene network expression. Advances in molecular biology techniques currently allow researchers to genetically modify mice to either overexpress or completely lack specific genes, thereby studying their function in an in vivo setting. Furthermore, the use of mammary-specific promoters has allowed genes related to mammary gland function to be eliminated from the mammary gland in a developmental and tissue-specific manner. These studies have demonstrated the complexity that underlies mammary gland development and function in rodents and may provide insight into the mechanisms that ultimately allow the ruminant or swine mammary gland to function in a coordinated fashion throughout puberty, pregnancy, lactation, and involution. The challenge facing animal scientists is how to obtain similar information in much larger and expensive livestock. One possible approach is to manipulate gene expression in vitro using mammary cell culture models derived from domestic animals (e.g., genes can be "knocked down" using small interfering RNA approaches). Ultimately, major advances in understanding lactation biology may come from coupling basic mechanistic information with functional genomics, proteomics, and metabolomics approaches. A strong foundation in bioinformatics will also be required to optimize use of these new technologies. Stem cell biology also represents an exciting area in the next decade that holds promise for improving lactation efficiency. Strong training of our future scientists in these areas should facilitate livestock-focused mammary gland research that will allow basic information to be gained at unprecedented amounts, ultimately leading to optimization of livestock production. 3alivestock 3amammary glands 3alactation 3abiochemical pathways 3amammary development 3aapoptosis 3asignal transduction 3amice 3aanimal models 3agene expression 3agenetic engineering 3apromoter regions 3apuberty 3apregnancy 3amammary involution 3ain vitro studies 3acultured cells 3aRNA interference 3agenomics 3aproteomics 3ametabolomics 2aAnimal Husbandryxmethodsxtrends. 2aAnimals 2aCattle 2aGene Expression Regulation 2aGene Regulatory Networks 2aGenome 2aLactationxphysiology 2aMammary Glands, Animalxcytology 2aMice 2aMicroRNAs 2aModels, Animal 2aRNA Interference 2aSignal Transduction 2aStem Cellsxcytology 2aSwine 2aSystems Biology 0aliterature reviews 0alactation biology 0amolecular sequence data1 aCohick, W.S.0 tJournal of animal science.g2009 Feb., v. 87, no. 2 p.813-824dAmerican Society of Animal Sciencex0021-88127nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2527/jas.2008-13753Available from publisher's Web site  a20090413b20090508c00000000  aINDd2CTe2009/03/24  aOther US 7aarticle02362naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245008900126300001600215520131300231650001401544650001301558650002101571650001601592650001501608650001201623650002301635650002101658650001801679653001601697653001601713700001701729700001801746700001701764700001801781773009901799852000901898930003301907945001301940946001101953655001201964IND2053305720221116182205.0961001e199604  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205330572DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNoble, R.C.10aYolk lipids and their fatty acids in the wild and captive ostrich (Struthio camelus)  ap. 753-756.  aA comparative study has been made of the major lipid fractions and their fatty acid compositions in the yolk of eggs from ostriches under wild and farmed conditions. There were no differences in the lipid contents and proportions of the lipid fractions between the two groups of yolks. In both groups of yolks triacylglycerol and phospholipid were the major fractions. In the eggs from the wild ostriches, all the lipid fractions displayed substantial concentrations of C18 polyunsaturated fatty acids, triacylglycerol being particularly rich in linolenic acid and phospholipid rich in linoleic acid; phospholipid displayed substantial concentrations also of C20 and C22 polyunsaturates. There were considerable differences in the fatty acid compositions between the yolks. Those from the farmed birds displayed lower proportions of C18 polyunsaturates, particularly linolenic acid, throughout the lipid fractions. Compensatory increases were displayed most obviously in the concentrations of oleic acid and palmitoleic acid as well as other acids. The distinctive and extensive changes in fatty acid composition, particularly relating to the polyunsaturates, are discussed with respect to overall dietary requirements and specificities for embryo metabolism and possible effects on reproductive performance. 3aostriches 3aegg yolk 3anutrient content 3afatty acids 3awild birds 3apoultry 3acholesteryl esters 3atriacylglycerols 3aphospholipids 0acomparisons 0acomposition1 aSpeake, B.K.1 aMcCartney, R.1 aFoggin, C.M.1 aDeeming, D.C.0 tComparative biochemistry and physiology.g1996 Apr., v. 113B, no. 4 p.753-756x1096-49597nnas  aDNAL  a19961101b19961107c00000000  aINDdLDP  aNon-US 7aarticle03592naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001900145245010200164300001800266500002400284520204400308650001202352650002402364650002802388650001602416650002002432650001702452650001402469650001302483650001702496650001102513650002202524650001202546650002402558650001102582650002202593650002202615650002102637650001502658650001202673650001202685650001702697650001902714650002202733650001002755651001102765700001902776700002102795700002302816700001802839773011202857852000902969856004802978655001203026IND4411363120221116182116.0081010e200811  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441136312DNAL7 a10.1007/s10531-008-9409-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMüller, Jörg14aThe European spruce bark beetle Ips typographus in a national park: from pest to keystone species  ap. 2979-3001.  aIncludes references  aThe influence of natural disturbance on biodiversity is poorly known in the intensively cultivated landscape of Europe. As an example of insect disturbance we studied effects of gaps generated by outbreaks of the spruce bark beetle (Ips typographus) on biodiversity in the area of the National Park “Bavarian Forest” and compared them with openings (e.g. meadows) created by humans in these forests. Insects were sampled using flight interception traps across twelve ecotones between edges of closed forest, six bark beetle gaps and six meadows. The diversity and species density of true bugs and of bees/wasps increased significantly from the closed stand to the edge, and continued to increase inside the openings at interior and exterior edges. Species density in saproxylic beetles also increased significantly from closed forest to opening, but only across ecotones including bark beetle gaps. Similarly, the number of critically endangered saproxylic beetles increased significantly in bark beetle gaps. Using indicator species analysis a total of 60 species were identified as possessing a statistically significant value indicating preference for one of the habitat types along the ecotones: 29 of them preferred gaps, 24 preferred meadows, three were characteristic for edges of meadows, three for edges of bark beetle gaps, but only one was typical of closed forest. Most of our results support the thesis that I. typographus fulfils the majority of criteria for a keystone species, particularly that of maintenance of biodiversity in forests. Our results emphasize the value for the study and conservation of insect diversity of the policy of non-interference with natural processes pursued in some protected areas. As a recommendation to forest management for increasing insect diversity even in commercial forest, we suggest that logging in recent gaps in medium aged mixed montane stands should aim at retention of a part of the dead wood. Planting should be avoided, to lengthen the important phase of sunlit conditions. 3aApoidea 3aDendroctonus micans 3aDendroctonus rufipennis 3aHeteroptera 3aIps typographus 3abark beetles 3adead wood 3aecotones 3aedge effects 3aflight 3aforest management 3aforests 3ahabitat preferences 3ahumans 3aindicator species 3aissues and policy 3akeystone species 3alandscapes 3alogging 3ameadows 3amixed stands 3anational parks 3aspecies diversity 3atraps 3aEurope1 aBußler, Heinz1 aGossner, Martin.1 aRettelbach, Thomas1 aDuelli, Peter0 tBiodiversity and conservation.g2008 Nov., v. 17, no. 12 p.2979-3001dSpringer Netherlandsx0960-31157nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10531-008-9409-1 7aarticle02326naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002000110245016800130300001600298500001500314520119100329650002301520650004301543650001801586650001901604650001301623650001201636650000901648650000901657650002001666653001501686653004001701700001601741700001801757773009901775852000901874930003301883945001301916946001101929655001201940IND2052229520221116182106.0960722e199602  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205222952DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFaulconnier, Y.10aLipoprotein lipase and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase activities in bovine and ovine adipose tissue incubated for 7 day: effects of insulin and/or dexamethasone  ap. 421-426.  a2019-12-06  aThe in vitro regulation of lipoprotein lipase (LPL) and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH) activity in bovine and ovine adipose tissue was investigated. Adult non-lactating non-pregnant cows (n = 5) or ewes (n = 5) were given limited amounts of feed for 8 or 10 days and then overfed for 10 (ewes) or 21 (cows) days. Perirenal adipose tissue explants were incubated for 2, 4 or 7 days. Regardless of the experimental conditions, the activity of LPL and G6PDH after 2 days of incubation was lower than in fresh tissue. Insulin significantly increased LPL activity in bovine but not in ovine adipose tissue, and it had no effect on G6PDH activity in the two species. Dexamethasone addition to the insulin-supplemented medium significantly increased LPL activity in ovine adipose tissue, whereas it was decreased in bovine adipose tissue on days 4 and 7. Moreover, dexamethasone addition to the insulin-supplemented medium did not change G6PDH activity in the two species on day 2, whereas it was increased in bovine and ovine adipose tissue on days 4 and 7. Therefore, the effects of insulin and/or dexamethasone on LPL and G6PDH differed with ruminant species and incubation time. 3alipoprotein lipase 3aNADP-glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase 3adexamethasone 3aadipose tissue 3aexplants 3ainsulin 3aewes 3acows 3aenzyme activity 0aregulation 0aglucose-6-phosphate 1-dehydrogenase1 aGuillon, L.1 aChilliard, Y.0 tComparative biochemistry and physiology.g1996 Feb., v. 113B, no. 2 p.421-426x1096-49597nnas  aDNAL  a19960903b19960911c00000000  aINDdLDP  aNon-US 7aarticle03306naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003200092040001800124100001800142245009200160300001600252500002400268520201600292650001902308650001202327650001502339650001202354650002402366650001002390650002002400650001302420650000902433650001102442650001902453650001402472650001802486650001702504650001502521650001202536650002102548651001602569700002302585700002302608700002402631773012702655852000902782856004502791655001202836IND4429711620100101232634.0091207e200912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442971162DNAL7 a10.1002/jpln.2008002312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMerz, Andreas10aPlant-compositional effects on surface runoff and sediment yield in subalpine grassland  ap. 777-788.  aIncludes references  aSoil erosion such as sheet erosion is frequently encountered in subalpine grassland in the Urseren Valley (Swiss Central Alps). Erosion damages have increased enormously in this region during the last 50 y, most likely due to changes in land-use practices and due to the impact of climatic changes. In order to estimate the effect of vegetation characteristics on surface runoff and sediment loss, we irrigated 22 pasture plots of 1 m² during 1 h at an intense rain rate of 50 mm h⁻¹ in two field campaigns using a portable rain simulator. The rain-simulation plots differed in plant composition (herb versus grass dominance) and land-use intensity but not in plant cover (>90%) nor in soil conditions. Prior to the second rain-simulation campaign, aboveground vegetation was clipped in order to simulate intense grazing. The generated surface runoffs, sediment loss, relative water retention in the aboveground vegetation, and changes in soil moisture were quantified. Runoff coefficient varied between 0.1% and 25%, and sediment loss ranged between 0 and 0.053 g m⁻². Thus, high infiltration rates and full vegetation cover resulted in very low erosion rates even under such extreme rain events. Surface runoff did not differ significantly between herb- and grass-dominated plots. However, clipping had a notable effect on surface runoff in the test plots under different land-use intensity. In plots without or with intensive use, surface runoff decreased after clipping whereas in extensively used plots, surface runoff increased after the clipping. This opposite effect was mainly explained by higher necromass and litter presence at the extensively used plots after the clipping treatment. The results obtained here contribute to a better understanding of the importance of vegetation characteristics on surface-runoff formation, thus, on soil-erosion control. Overall, we delineate vegetation parameters to be crucial in soil-erosion control which are directly modified by the land-use management. 3aclimate change 3agrasses 3agrasslands 3agrazing 3aground cover plants 3aherbs 3aland use change 3apastures 3arain 3arunoff 3asediment yield 3asediments 3asheet erosion 3asoil quality 3asoil water 3avalleys 3avegetation cover 3aAlps region1 aAlewell, Christine1 aHiltbrunner, Erika1 aBänninger, Dominik0 tZeitschrift für Pflanzenernährung und Bodenkunde.g2009 Dec., v. 172, no. 6 p.777-788dWiley-VCH Verlagx1436-87307nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jpln.200800231 7aarticle02779naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002000145245015600165300001600321500002400337520161000361650002601971650001801997650001202015650002002027650001102047650003102058650001302089650001502102650001502117650001102132650001102143650001402154650001302168700001902181700001902200773010502219852000902324856004802333655001202381IND4440420120221116181940.0100723e201008  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444042012DNAL7 a10.1007/s10499-009-9298-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGionet, Chantal10aElimination of animals with best growth potential as a possible effect of the culling of Mercenaria mercenaria notata (L.) larvae in hatchery procedure  ap. 801-812.  aIncludes references  aThe Mercenaria mercenaria notata line was introduced into the Canadian Atlantic provinces in the late 1990s because of its fast growth rate when compared with that of the current native line. The purpose of this study was to compare the development of two groups of M. mercenaria notata, according to the initial size of the individuals, in order to check whether the current hatchery practice of keeping only the largest larvae may ultimately eliminate the best performing animals. The larvae were raised and sorted by size according to standard hatchery practices. On the tenth day post-fertilization, the two larval size groups were formed. The “initially smaller” (IS) and the “initially larger” (IL) animals were grown separately. Mortality, shell length and energy reserves were measured for both groups at three stages: veliger, post-settling and juvenile. The observed mortality in the two groups was low varying from 8.1 to 19.6%. The IS animals had a higher shell growth rate (18.2 μm/day) when compared to the IL group (12.7 μm/day) with the result that at the end of the experiment, the IS animals were larger than the IL. In both groups, the lipid and protein concentrations diminished rapidly during the veliger stage but faster in the IL group. The glycogen level remained at the limit of detection for all the three stages. The use of energy reserves followed a different pattern according to the group size. This study indicates that culling would have led us to discard the animals which in fact have the best growth potential in that their rate of shell growth is the highest. 3aMercenaria mercenaria 3aanimal growth 3aanimals 3adetection limit 3aenergy 3aenergy use and consumption 3aglycogen 3agroup size 3ahatcheries 3alarvae 3alipids 3amortality 3aproteins1 aMayrand, Elise1 aLandry, Thomas0 tAquaculture international.g2010 Aug., v. 18, no. 5 p.801-812dSpringer Netherlandsx0967-61207nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10499-009-9298-7 7aarticle02763naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002100145245013800166300001600304500002400320520160400344650001501948650002201963650001201985650002201997650001502019650001502034650002302049650001902072650001502091651001202106653002202118653002802140653002102168653002002189773011102209852000902320856004802329655001202377IND4401207520221116181345.0080210e200512  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440120752DNAL7 a10.1007/s10342-005-0087-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSeidling, Walter10aGround floor vegetation assessment within the intensive (Level II) monitoring of forest ecosystems in Germany: chances and challenges  ap. 301-312.  aIncludes references  aAs a part of the 'Intensive Forest Monitoring Programme' of ICP Forests, ground floor vegetation has been surveyed along with parameters of other relevant components of the forest ecosystems and their environment at 80 permanent plots all over Germany. Its floristic composition and their changes can therefore be linked to a wide variety of potentially influencing factors, scrutinising recent hypotheses on floristic changes, mainly soil eutrophication and acidification due to air pollutants. Results of a broad-scaled feasibility study are presented and critically discussed with regard to future in-depth evaluations. After an overview on the most abundant species, the syntaxonomic allocation of the plots is given. An ordination reveals a gradient from nutrient and base rich soils to poor acidic soils. Floristic dynamics are mainly aligned with the main axis, but conclusions about the medium-term development cannot be stated yet. Ordination and subsequent statistics are recommended to open up a wide field for explorative investigations. Indicator values for soil acidity and nutrient supply corroborate the main floristic gradient. Based on an empirical species-area relationship (SAR), species numbers for a common plot size of 400 m² were calculated. Basic relationships among different diversity measures and between diversity measures and basic stand and site-related parameters were elaborated. Recommendations focus on enhancements of the assessment of ground floor vegetation within the context of the Level II monitoring like annual sampling or harmonisation of the plot sizes. 3aacid soils 3aforest ecosystems 3aforests 3aground vegetation 3amonitoring 3apollutants 3asoil acidification 3asoil nutrients 3astatistics 3aGermany 0aForest monitoring 0aGround floor vegetation 0aIndicator values 0aPlant diversity0 tEuropean journal of forest research.g2005 Dec., v. 124, no. 4 p.301-312dSpringer-Verlagx1612-46697nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10342-005-0087-1 7aarticle02383naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131100001600149245007300165300001600238500002400254500001500278520117000293650000901463650001201472650001001484650002101494650001101515650001101526650002601537650002001563650000901583650002201592650001501614650001701629650001001646650001001656653001101666700001701677700001601694700001401710700001801724773012101742852000901863856005301872655001201925IND4463124720221116175526.0120503e20031130xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446312472DNAL7 a10.1016/S0168-1923(03)00139-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBerry, P.M.12aA calibrated model of wheat lodging compared with field measurements  ap. 167-180.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-05  aThis paper describes how an existing model of lodging in winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) has been further developed to enable it to predict the timing and amount of lodging from inputs about the crop, soil and weather. Improvements include the use of recently specified values for the drag coefficient and damping ratio of wheat shoots, accounting for temporal and spatial non-uniformity of plant characteristics, and using daily rainfall and wind run data. Stem and root lodging are predicted when the base bending moment of the shoot(s) exceed the failure moments of the stem base and anchorage system, respectively. Tests show that the model can predict the timing and quantity of lodging in crops with a wide range of lodging risks. Each area of further development contributed to the improvement of the model. Using accurate values of drag coefficient and damping ratio reduced failure wind speeds by 44% to more realistic values. Accounting for temporal non-uniformity of plants meant that the increase in lodging risk towards harvest was correctly predicted. Accounting for spatial non-uniformity enabled different sized areas of lodging to be predicted. 3arisk 3alodging 3astems 3adrag coefficient 3ashoots 3amodels 3aplant characteristics 3asoil weathering 3arain 3aTriticum aestivum 3awind speed 3awinter wheat 3aroots 3acrops 0ainputs1 aSterling, M.1 aBaker, C.J.1 aSpink, J.1 aSparkes, D.L.0 tAgricultural and forest meteorology.g2003 Nov. 30, v. 119, no. 3-4 p.167-180dElsevier Science Ltdx0168-19237nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0168-1923(03)00139-4

An understanding of the mechanisms of sucrose utilization in parasites is an important step in the development of new control methods. Therefore, in this study, we characterized the invertase gene family in P. ramosa and analysed its involvement in plant development. Invertase-encoded cDNAs were isolated using degenerate primers corresponding to highly conserved regions of invertases. In addition to enzyme assays, gene expression was analysed using real-time quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction during overall plant development. The dominant isoform was purified and sequenced using electrospray ionization-liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (ESI-LC-MS/MS). Five invertase-encoded cDNAs were thus characterized, including PrSai1 which encodes a soluble acid invertase (SAI). Of the five invertases, PrSai1 transcripts and SAI activity were dominant in growing organs. The most active invertase corresponded to the PrSai1 gene product. The purified PrSAI1 displayed low pI and optimal pH values, specificity for β-fructofuranosides and inhibition by metallic ions and competitive inhibition by fructose. PrSAI1 is a typical vacuolar SAI that is actively involved in growth following both germination and attachment to host roots. In addition, germinated seeds displayed enhanced cell wall invertase activity (PrCWI) in comparison with preconditioned seeds, suggesting the contribution of this activity in the sink strength of infected roots during the subsequent step of root penetration. Our results show that PrSAI1 and, possibly, PrCWI constitute good targets for the development of new transgenic resistance in host plants using proteinaceous inhibitors or silencing strategies. 3aparasites 3agermination 3aions 3acomplementary DNA 3aseeds 3acell walls 3asucrose 3ahost plants 3agene expression 3abeta-fructofuranosidase 3agenes 3apH 3afructose 3amass spectrometry 3aroots 3acrops 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aOrobanchaceaexenzymologyxgenetics. 2aPhylogeny 2aPlant Proteinsxchemistryxclassificationxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aProtein Isoformsxchemistryxclassificationxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aReverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction 2aSpectrometry, Mass, Electrospray Ionization 2aTandem Mass Spectrometry 2abeta-Fructofuranosidasexchemistryxclassificationxgeneticsxmetabolism. 0amethodology 0anew methods1 aPÉRON, THOMAS1 aPOUVREAU, JEAN-BERNARD1 aVÉRONÉSI, CHRISTOPHE1 aJÉGOU, SANDRINE1 aDELAVAULT, PHILIPPE1 aTHOIRON, SÉVERINE1 aSIMIER, PHILIPPE0 tMolecular plant pathology.g2011 Sept., v. 12, no. 7 p.638-652dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx1464-67227nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1364-3703.2010.00702.x 7aarticle04133naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002400145245011000169300001600279500002400295520253900319650002702858650001602885650001802901650001702919650001802936650002002954650002702974650002703001650001203028650001603040650001803056650002003074650002203094650002303116650002203139650001803161650000903179650002403188650001803212650001903230650002103249650002103270650001103291650001203302651001503314700002003329700001903349700001803368700001903386773010503405852000903510856004803519655001203567IND4434690220221116175426.0100326e201004  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443469022DNAL7 a10.1007/s11368-009-0168-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGutiérrez, Iris R.10aEffect of sulfonamide antibiotics on microbial diversity and activity in a Californian Mollic Haploxeralf  ap. 537-544.  aIncludes references  aPurpose Up to 90% of antibiotics that are fed to livestock are excreted unaltered or as metabolites and thus are present in manure. By application of manure as fertilizer, veterinary antibiotics can reach soil and groundwater. The aim of this study is to determine the effect of three commonly used (and simultaneously applied) sulfonamide antibiotics on both function and structural diversity of soil microorganisms. To this end, the activity of the enzymes urease and dehydrogenase was determined, and the composition of phospholipid fatty acids (PLFA) was analyzed. Materials and methods Soil and manure were sampled at a dairy farm located in the Northern San Joaquin Valley, California, USA. Soil (700 g) was amended with either mineral water only (W-treatments), liquid manure (M-treatments), or with glucose solution (G-treatments). Each of these soil treatments was mixed with a cocktail of three sulfonamides: sulfadimethoxine (SDT), sulfamethoxazole (SMX), and sulfamethazine (SMZ) at five total concentration levels ranging from 0 (control) to 900 µg g dm ⁻¹ . After 24, 48, 96, 168, 264, 384, and 504 h, UA and DHA were determined; PLFA composition in selected samples was analyzed at t = 168 h and 504 h of incubation. Results and discussion In the G-treatments, urease activity decreased with higher sulfonamide concentrations; no effect was observed when no glucose was added (W-treatments). While a dose-response relationship was observed for urease activity after 168 h, a similar inhibition was measured after 380 h at all sulfonamide concentrations. Sulfonamides also reduced dehydrogenase activity in the G-treatments, but results are less conclusive than for urease. With increasing sulfonamide concentration, microbial and bacterial biomass decreased in the G-treatments compared to the control at 168 h. Sulfonamides caused a relative community shift towards gram-negative bacteria and towards an increased proportion of fungal biomass. Strong inhibition of urease by manure (M-treatments) was observed even without the addition of sulfonamides. Conclusions Sulfonamides clearly affected both the function and structural diversity of the soil microbial community over at least 16 days. The soil microbial community was affected by sulfonamides even at a relatively low concentration, although this soil receives regular input of manure that contains several antibiotics. Further research is needed addressing both long-term effects and lower sulfonamide concentrations under dynamic boundary conditions. 3aGram-negative bacteria 3aantibiotics 3adairy farming 3adairy manure 3adose response 3aenzyme activity 3afatty acid composition 3afertilizer application 3aglucose 3agroundwater 3aliquid manure 3alivestock feeds 3along term effects 3amicrobial activity 3amicrobial biomass 3amineral water 3asoil 3asoil microorganisms 3asoil sampling 3asoil treatment 3asulfadimethoxine 3asulfamethoxazole 3aurease 3avalleys 3aCalifornia1 aWatanabe, Naoko1 aHarter, Thomas1 aGlaser, Bruno1 aRadke, Michael0 tJournal of soils and sediments.g2010 Apr., v. 10, no. 3 p.537-544dSpringer-Verlagx1439-01087nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11368-009-0168-8 7aarticle02252naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001500110245010100125300001800226500001500244520103600259650002101295650002201316650001701338650002101355650002101376650001701397650002601414650001501440650002201455650000901477650002601486650001401512650001501526650001201541650001101553651001301564653001501577653002101592653001001613700002001623773007101643852000901714930003301723945001301756946001301769655001201782IND2205847320221116175227.0000718e199912  vau|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220584732DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKahn, B.A.10aRoot characteristics and seed yields of cowpeas grown with and without added nitrogen fertilizer  ap. 1238-1239.  a2019-12-05  aField experiments were conducted in Oklahoma in 1993 and 1994.

Sample plants were excavated at first pod set and analyzed for nodulation and root morphology. Additional plants were harvested at the green-shell stage to determine seed yield and plant N concentration. Conventional and reduced input cow peas did not differ in dry weight of root mass components, total root dry weight shoot dry weight, shoot : root ratio, nodule distribution among root morphological components, total nodule fresh weight, plant N concentration, or green-shell seed yield. Most of the nodule fresh weight generally was associated with nodules on the basal and lateral roots.

Lam.] were studied. For comparison, 'Jewel' was included at one spacing. As in-row plant spacing decreased, yield of U.S. No. 1, canners, and total marketable root production increased when plants were harvested 103 days or later after transplanting. The yield of jumbo roots generally increased with in-row spacing because of less plant-to-plant competition. Total marketable and No. 1 grade yields of 'Beauregard' at the closest spacing (15 cm) were greater than those of 'Jewel'. 'Beauregard' roots sized more quickly than 'Jewel' roots regardless of spacing. The optimal time for harvesting 'Beauregard' was 100 to 110 days after transplanting, while acceptable yields could be obtained as early as 90 days after transplanting depending on market prices. Economic analysis of 'Beauregard' spacing data indicated that 23 cm would be the preferred spacing if a late harvest was anticipated, while the 15-cm spacing would be best if harvested at approximately equal to 110 days after transplanting. Thus, sweetpotato growers should place 'Beauregard' at an in-row spacing of 15 or 23 cm, depending on projected date of harvest, on or before 10 June, to obtain the best yields with the highest return on investment. 3aharvest date 3acrop quality 3acosts and returns 3aplant density 3aIpomoea batatas 3acrop yield 3amarket prices 3aplant competition 3aNorth Carolina 0asize 0aeconomic analysis1 aWalters, S.A.1 aAdams, D.E.1 aEstes, E.A.0 tHortScience.g1999 Dec., v. 34, no. 7 p.1229-1233x0018-53457nnas  aDNAL  a20001102b20001113c00000000  aINDdCTR  aOther US 7aarticle02017naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002100110245015300131300001600284520098400300650001901284650001001303650002201313650002001335650000901355650001401364650001401378650001201392650001001404650001601414650001601430650001901446650001201465650000901477650001001486651001101496773012701507852000901634655001201643IND4514318320221116174906.0150923e201412  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND451431832DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKhusainov, R.

About 40 first instar larvae of colony-reared ECB were used to infest plants in both whorl and silking stages of growth. At harvest, plants infested at the whorl stage were evaluated for numbers of larvae and larval tunnels, and length of larval tunnels. Plants infested at the silking stage were evaluated for number of larvae per ear and were rated for ear damage using a 9-point scale. Resistance rankings among cultivars were consistent between years and between silk-and whorl-infested plants. We conclude that there is a substantial range of resistance already present in processing sweet corn cultivars, and that resistance is probably a combination of both exclusion and suppression of feeding. Our findings have two immediate uses: incorporation into existing IPM programs and incorporation of identifiable resistance bearing cultivars into a long-term breeding program for resistance to ECB in sweet corn. 3aZea mays 3apest resistance 3acultivars 3agenetic resistance 3alarvae 3aplant development 3acorn ears 3acrop damage 3aNew York 0acrop growth stage 0ainfestation1 aHoffmann, M.P.1 aSmith, M.E.0 tHortScience.g2000 Aug., v. 35, no. 5 p.871-874x0018-53457nnas  aDNAL  a20010204b20010209c00000000  aINDdCTR  aOther US 7aarticle02503naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001800110245010200128300001600230520130700246650001801553650002501571650002101596650001701617650002001634650001601654650002001670650001401690650001301704650001101717650001101728650001501739650001501754651001201769653001301781653001501794653001601809700001901825700001501844700001701859700002001876773006901896852000901965930003301974945001302007946001302020655001202033IND2207375620221116174904.0001019e200008  vau|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220737562DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNesbitt, M.L.10aPerformance of satsuma mandarin protected from freezing temperatures by microsprinkler irrigation  ap. 856-859.  aSeveral microsprinkler treatments were tested on 5-year-old satsuma mandarin orange (Citrus unshiu Marc.) trees to compare survivability of trunks and scaffold limbs in severe freezes. Three damaging freeze events occurred during winter, with two in 1995-96 and one in 1996-97. Air temperature dropped to -9.4, -5.6, and -6.7 degrees C, respectively. Almost 90% of the foliage was dead on the control plants after the first freezing event and 98% after the second. A single microsprinkler 1.6 m high in the canopy delivering 90.8 L(.)h-1 reduced injury; only 54% of the canopy was dead after the first freeze and 71% after the second. There was slightly more shoot-tip dieback on the plants in the microsprinkler treatments than on the control plants after the first two freezes. The amount of limb breakage by ice was minor. The third freeze killed 34% of the canopy in the control plants, but only 26% in the plants in the microsprinkler treatments. Use of microsprinklers increased yield in 1996, but yield for all treatments was very low. Yield for all treatments fully recovered in 1997, averaging 153 kg/tree. Although no death of scaffold limbs or trunks occurred, these results demonstrate that microsprinkler irrigation reduces damage to foliage and increases yield somewhat in severe freezes. 3aCitrus unshiu 3asprinkler irrigation 3aplant protection 3afrost injury 3aair temperature 3acold stress 3acrop management 3amortality 3abranches 3aleaves 3acanopy 3acrop yield 3atree trunk 3aAlabama 0abreakage 0aevaluation 0aperformance1 aMcDaniel, N.R.1 aEbel, R.C.1 aDozier, W.A.1 aHimelrick, D.G.0 tHortScience.g2000 Aug., v. 35, no. 5 p.856-859x0018-53457nnas  aDNAL  a20010204b20010209c00000000  aINDdCTR  aOther US 7aarticle01875naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002000110245007600130300001600206520077700222650001100999650002601010650002001036650001601056650001701072650001401089650001601103650001701119650001501136650002001151650002201171650001601193650002001209650001601229651001701245653000901262653001701271653001601288773006901304852000901373930003301382945001301415946001301428655001201441IND2207375520221116175013.0001019e200008  vau|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220737552DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGreenland, R.G.10aOptimum height at which to kill barley used as a living mulch in onions  ap. 853-855.  aPlanting barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) as a living mulch with onions (Allium cepa L.) reduces soil erosion and protects the onions from wind damage. It can also reduce yield and size of onion bulbs if not managed correctly. In a 4-year study at the Oakes Irrigation Research Site in North Dakota, barley was planted in the spring at the same time that onions were direct-seeded. Barley rows were planted either parallel with or perpendicular to the onion rows. Barley was killed with fluazifop-P herbicide when approximately 13, 18, 23, or 30 cm tall. Onion size and yields were reduced when barley was allowed to grow taller than 18 cm before killing it. Total onion yield was usually greater when barley was planted parallel with, rather than perpendicular to, onion rows. 3aheight 3aplant characteristics 3aHordeum vulgare 3aAllium cepa 3alive mulches 3amortality 3afluazifop-P 3awind erosion 3acrop yield 3acrop management 3aplant competition 3acover crops 3aerosion control 3asowing date 3aNorth Dakota 0asize 0ayield losses 0awind damage0 tHortScience.g2000 Aug., v. 35, no. 5 p.853-855x0018-53457nnas  aDNAL  a20010204b20010209c00000000  aINDdCTR  aOther US 7aarticle02201naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002100110245009500131300001600226520129000242650002501532650001001557650001601567650001401583650001401597650002301611651001701634653001501651653001101666653001901677700001801696773006901714852000901783930003301792945001301825946001301838655001201851IND2207378220221116174910.0001019e200008  vau|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220737822DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLandschoot, P.J.12aA comparison of visual vs. instrumental measurement of color differences in bentgrass turf  ap. 914-916.  aThis study was conducted to determine: 1) if the Minolta CR-310 Chroma Meter can detect color differences among bentgrass (Agrostis stolonifera L., A. capillaris L.) cultivars maintained as a turf; 2) how the CR-310 parameters of hue angle, lightness, and chroma compare with visual color assessments; and 3) if the CR-310 can provide consistent color measurements among evaluators. Differences were detected among cultivars with respect to hue angle, lightness, and chroma. Hue angle and chroma were significantly correlated with visual color assessments when data were averaged across all evaluators. Lightness was not strongly associated with visual color assessment. Differences were found among evaluators for visual color assessment, lightness, and chroma, but not for hue angle measurements. Thus, hue angle appears to be the most consistent CR-310 parameter for measuring color of bentgrass turf. These results indicate that the CR-310 can be used to evaluate the color of bentgrass cultivars maintained as a turf and provides consistent hue angle measurements among evaluators, regardless of experience in rating turf color. The CR-310 is probably best used for measuring relative color differences and may be useful if cultivars of similar color are desired in blended turfs. 3aAgrostis stolonifera 3acolor 3ameasurement 3aequipment 3acultivars 3aoptical properties 3aPennsylvania 0aevaluation 0aerrors 0avisual grading1 aMancino, C.F.0 tHortScience.g2000 Aug., v. 35, no. 5 p.914-916x0018-53457nnas  aDNAL  a20010204b20010209c00000000  aINDdCTR  aOther US 7aarticle02501naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245011700127300001800244500001500262520131300277650001201590650001101602650001501613650001501628650001301643650003201656650001401688650002001702650002501722651001101747651001001758651001001768653002601778653001501804700001501819700002601834700001401860700001501874700001501889773007101904852000901975930003301984945001302017946001302030655001202043IND2205850620221116175228.0000718e199912  vau|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220585062DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPinochet, J.10aResistance of peach and plum rootstocks from Spain, France, and Italy to root-knot nematode Meloidogyne javanica  ap. 1259-1262.  a2019-12-05  aTwo trials involving 20 Prunus rootstocks were conducted under greenhouse conditions to screen for resistance to root-knot nematode [Meloidogyne javanica (Treub.)

Large changes in relative retention on the compared columns can result from steric resistance, differences in the phase ratios, and from dewetting at low methanol compositions while changes in intermolecular interactions are responsible for smaller changes at a fixed mobile phase composition. For Synergi Hydro-RP and Polar-RP changing methanol for acetonirile is more powerful for affecting changes in retention order than changing the stationary phase. The three Synergi columns show useful selectivity differences for method development when compared with 13 other modern reversed-phase columns representing a selection of different stationary phase chemistries. The results from this study indicate the limitations of classifying reversed-phase columns by the retention of prototypical compounds to define specific retention mechanisms. 3achromatography 3acohesion 3ahydrogen bonding 3amethanol 3amodels1 aPoole, C.

Due to the high concentration of reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated by the oxidative phosphorylation pathway, the mitochondrial genome is highly exposed to oxidative stress leading to mitochondrial DNA injury. Accordingly, mitochondrial DNA damage was shown to be associated with ageing as well as with numerous human diseases including neurodegenerative disorders and cancer. To date, several methods have been described to detect damaged mitochondrial DNA, but those techniques are semi-quantitative and often require high amounts of genomic input DNA. We developed a rapid and quantitative method to evaluate the relative levels of damage in mitochondrial DNA by using the real time-PCR amplification of mitochondrial DNA fragments of different lengths. We investigated mitochondrial DNA damage in SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma cells exposed to hydrogen peroxide or stressed by over-expression of the tyrosinase gene. In the past, there has been speculation about a variable vulnerability to oxidative stress along the mitochondrial genome. Our results indicate the existence of at least one mitochondrial DNA hot spot, namely the D-Loop, being more prone to ROS-derived damage.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDNA damage 3aDNA fragmentation 3agene overexpression 3agenes 3ahuman diseases 3ahumans 3ahydrogen peroxide 3amitochondria 3amitochondrial DNA 3amitochondrial genome 3aneoplasms 3aneurodegenerative diseases 3aoxidative phosphorylation 3aoxidative stress 3aquantitative analysis 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction1 aGasser, Thomas1 aPatenge, Nadja0 tNucleic acids research.g2010 Mar., v. 38, no. 4 p.e24-e24x0305-10487nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkp10823Available from publisher's Web site  a20100228b20100305c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02868naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002900092024002200121024001900143040001800162100002400180245011100204300001800315506007600333520141200409506003701821650001801858650002701876650002101903650002301924650001801947650001901965650002101984650001802005650002302023650001402046650001602060650002702076700002502103700001702128700001602145773008202161852000902243856007902252930003302331946001102364990002302375655001202398IND4433319820221207070657.0100228e201003  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443331982DNAL7 a10.1093/nar/gkp11252doi7 aPMC28313312pmcid7 a199695482pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVečerek, Branislav10aTranslational activation of rpoS mRNA by the non-coding RNA DsrA and Hfq does not require ribosome binding  ap. 1284-1293.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aAt low temperature, translational activation of rpoS mRNA, encoding the stationary phase sigma-factor, σS, involves the small regulatory RNA (sRNA) DsrA and the RNA chaperone Hfq. The Hfq-mediated DsrA-rpoS interaction relieves an intramolecular secondary structure that impedes ribosome access to the rpoS ribosome binding site. In addition, DsrA/rpoS duplex formation creates an RNase III cleavage site within the duplex. Previous biochemical studies suggested that DsrA and Hfq associate with the 30S ribosomal subunit protein S1, which implied a role for the ribosome in sRNA-mediated post-transcriptional regulation. Here, we show by ribosome profiling that Hfq partitions with the cytoplasmic fraction rather than with 30S subunits. Besides, by employing immunological techniques, no evidence for a physical interaction between Hfq and S1 was obtained. Similarly, in vitro studies did not reveal a direct interaction between DsrA and S1. By employing a ribosome binding deficient rpoS mRNA, and by using the RNase III clevage in the DsrA/rpoS duplex as a diagnostic marker, we provide in vivo evidence that the Hfq-mediated DsrA/rpoS interaction, and consequently the structural changes in rpoS mRNA precede ribosome binding. These data suggest a simple mechanistic model in which translational activation by DsrA provides a translationally competent rpoS mRNA to which 30S subunits can readily bind.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abinding sites 3aimmunologic techniques 3ain vitro studies 3amechanistic models 3amessenger RNA 3anon-coding RNA 3aprotein subunits 3aribonucleases 3aribosomal proteins 3aribosomes 3atemperature 3atranslation (genetics)1 aBeich-Frandsen, Mads1 aResch, Armin1 aBläsi, Udo0 tNucleic acids research.g2010 Mar., v. 38, no. 4 p.1284-1293x0305-10487nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkp11253Available from publisher's Web site  a20100228b20100305c00000000  aNon-US  mNon-PubAg articles 7aarticle02688naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002900092024002200121024001900143040001800162100002000180245011100200300001200311500001500323506007600338520138900414506003701803650001801840650002001858650002001878650001801898650001501916650001501931653002601946700001501972700002301987700002102010773008002031852000902111856007902120930003302199946001102232990002302243655001202266IND4433321620221207070152.0100228e201003  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443332162DNAL7 a10.1093/nar/gkp11162doi7 aPMC28313272pmcid7 a199695492pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEklund, Aron C.10aOptimization of the BLASTN substitution matrix for prediction of non-specific DNA microarray hybridization  ap. e27.  a2019-12-04  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aDNA microarray measurements are susceptible to error caused by non-specific hybridization between a probe and a target (cross-hybridization), or between two targets (bulk-hybridization). Search algorithms such as BLASTN can quickly identify potentially hybridizing sequences. We set out to improve BLASTN accuracy by modifying the substitution matrix and gap penalties. We generated gene expression microarray data for samples in which 1 or 10% of the target mass was an exogenous spike of known sequence. We found that the 10% spike induced 2-fold intensity changes in 3% of the probes, two-third of which were decreases in intensity likely caused by bulk-hybridization. These changes were correlated with similarity between the spike and probe sequences. Interestingly, even very weak similarities tended to induce a change in probe intensity with the 10% spike. Using this data, we optimized the BLASTN substitution matrix to more accurately identify probes susceptible to non-specific hybridization with the spike. Relative to the default substitution matrix, the optimized matrix features a decreased score for A-T base pairs relative to G-C base pairs, resulting in a 5-15% increase in area under the ROC curve for identifying affected probes. This optimized matrix may be useful in the design of microarray probes, and in other BLASTN-based searches for hybridization partners.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3ahybridization 3aDNA microarrays 3agene expression 3anucleic acids 3aalgorithms 3aprediction 0amicroarray technology1 aFriis, Pia1 aWernersson, Rasmus1 aSzallasi, Zoltan0 tNucleic acids research.g2010 Mar., v. 38, no. 4 p.e27-e27x0305-10487nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkp11163Available from publisher's Web site  a20100228b20100305c00000000  aNon-US  mNon-PubAg articles 7aarticle02761naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002900092024002200121024001900143040001800162100002100180245010000201300001800301506007600319520120600395506003701601650002101638650002201659650002701681650001201708650001101720650002801731650002301759650002001782650002001802650001601822650001701838650001801855650001301873650001101886650002701897650002201924700002101946700001601967700002301983773008202006852000902088856007902097930003302176946001102209990002302220655001202243IND4433319220221207070136.0100228e201003  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443331922DNAL7 a10.1093/nar/gkp10792doi7 aPMC28313082pmcid7 a199657702pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMeades, Glen Jr.12aA tale of two functions: enzymatic activity and translational repression by carboxyltransferase  ap. 1217-1227.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aAcetyl-CoA Carboxylase catalyzes the first committed step in fatty acid synthesis. Escherichia coli acetyl-CoA carboxylase is composed of biotin carboxylase, carboxyltransferase and biotin carboxyl carrier protein functions. The accA and accD genes that code for the α- and β-subunits, respectively, are not in an operon, yet yield an α₂β₂ carboxyltransferase. Here, we report that carboxyltransferase regulates its own translation by binding the mRNA encoding its subunits. This interaction is mediated by a zinc finger on the β-subunit; mutation of the four cysteines to alanine diminished nucleic acid binding and catalytic activity. Carboxyltransferase binds the coding regions of both subunit mRNAs and inhibits translation, an inhibition that is relieved by the substrate acetyl-CoA. mRNA binding reciprocally inhibits catalytic activity. Preferential binding of carboxyltransferase to RNA in situ was shown using fluorescence resonance energy transfer. We propose an unusual regulatory mechanism by which carboxyltransferase acts as a 'dimmer switch' to regulate protein production and catalytic activity, while sensing the metabolic state of the cell through acetyl-CoA concentration.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aEscherichia coli 3aacetyl coenzyme A 3aacetyl-CoA carboxylase 3aalanine 3abiotin 3abiotin-binding proteins 3acatalytic activity 3aenergy transfer 3aenzyme activity 3afatty acids 3afluorescence 3amessenger RNA 3amutation 3aoperon 3atranslation (genetics) 3azinc finger motif1 aBenson, Brian K.1 aGrove, Anne1 aWaldrop, Grover L.0 tNucleic acids research.g2010 Mar., v. 38, no. 4 p.1217-1227x0305-10487nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkp10793Available from publisher's Web site  a20100228b20100305c00000000  aNon-US  mNon-PubAg articles 7aarticle02754naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002900092024002200121024001900143040001800162100001600180245006300196300001800259500001500277506007600292520145000368506003701818650001601855650001801871650002201889650001101911650002601922650003001948650002201978653002902000700001902029700001902048700001802067700002102085773008202106852000902188856007902197930003302276946001102309655001202320IND4433318720221207070141.0100228e201003  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443331872DNAL7 a10.1093/nar/gkp10982doi7 aPMC28313182pmcid7 a199657722pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTerai, Goro10aDiscovery of short pseudogenes derived from messenger RNAs  ap. 1163-1171.  a2019-12-04  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aMore than 40% of the human genome is generated by retrotransposition, a series of in vivo processes involving reverse transcription of RNA molecules and integration of the transcripts into the genomic sequence. The mechanism of retrotransposition, however, is not fully understood, and additional genomic elements generated by retrotransposition may remain to be discovered. Here, we report that the human genome contains many previously unidentified short pseudogenes generated by retrotransposition of mRNAs. Genomic elements generated by non-long terminal repeat retrotransposition have specific sequence signatures: a poly-A tract that is immediately downstream and a pair of duplicated sequences, called target site duplications (TSDs), at either end. Using a new computer program, TSDscan, that can accurately detect pseudogenes based on the presence of the poly-A tract and TSDs, we found 654 short ([less-than or equal to]300 bp), previously unknown pseudogenes derived from mRNAs. Comprehensive analyses of the pseudogenes that we identified and their parent mRNAs revealed that the pseudogene length depends on the parent mRNA length: long mRNAs generate more short pseudogenes than do short mRNAs. To explain this phenomenon, we hypothesize that most long mRNAs are truncated before they are reverse transcribed. Truncated mRNAs would be rapidly degraded during reverse transcription, resulting in the generation of short pseudogenes.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3apseudogenes 3amessenger RNA 3achemical elements 3ahumans 3areverse transcription 3aterminal repeat sequences 3acomputer software 0atranscription (genetics)1 aYoshizawa, Aya1 aOkida, Hiroaki1 aAsai, Kiyoshi1 aMituyama, Toutai0 tNucleic acids research.g2010 Mar., v. 38, no. 4 p.1163-1171x0305-10487nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkp10983Available from publisher's Web site  a20100228b20100305c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02300naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002900092024002200121024001900143040001800162100001600180245009300196300001800289506007600307520091100383506003701294650000801331650002201339650000801361650001801369650002701387650002801414650001701442650001501459650001201474650001101486650001501497700002101512700001801533700002001551700002201571773008201593852000901675856007901684930003301763946001101796990002301807655001201830IND4433320120221207070146.0100228e201003  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443332012DNAL7 a10.1093/nar/gkp11182doi7 aPMC28313282pmcid7 a199695412pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Qixin10aPhosphate release contributes to the rate-limiting step for unwinding by an RNA helicase  ap. 1312-1324.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aRNA helicases function in numerous aspects of RNA biology. These enzymes are RNA-stimulated ATPases that translocate on RNA and unwind or remodel structured RNA in an ATP-dependent fashion. How ATP and the ATPase cycle fuel the work performed by helicases is not completely clear. The hepatitis C virus RNA helicase, NS3, is an important model system for this class of enzymes. NS3 binding to a single-/double-strand RNA or DNA junction leads to ATP-independent melting of the duplex and formation of a complex capable of ATP-dependent unwinding by using a spring-loaded mechanism. We have established an RNA substrate for NS3 that can be unwound in a single sub-step. Our studies are consistent with a model in which a single ATP binding and/or hydrolysis event sets the unwinding spring and phosphate dissociation contributes to release of the spring, thereby driving the power stroke used for unwinding.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDNA 3aHepatitis C virus 3aRNA 3aRNA helicases 3aadenosine triphosphate 3aadenosinetriphosphatase 3adissociation 3ahydrolysis 3amelting 3amodels 3aphosphates1 aArnold, Jamie J.1 aUchida, Akira1 aRaney, Kevin D.1 aCameron, Craig E.0 tNucleic acids research.g2010 Mar., v. 38, no. 4 p.1312-1324x0305-10487nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkp11183Available from publisher's Web site  a20100228b20100305c00000000  aNon-US  mNon-PubAg articles 7aarticle01109naa a2200349 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100001500115245005000130300001600180300002400196500002300220500001500243520017500258650001900433650001800452650003100470650002000501650003700521650001400558650001800572653001400590700001500604773006700619852000900686939003300695945000800728946001100736655001200747991589761180742620221116174757.0890301s1988    xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI890003742DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiao, M.L.10aChemistry of L-ascorbic acid related to foods  ap. 289-312.  ap. 289-312. charts.  aLiterature review.  a2019-12-05  aThe structure, physical properties and selected chemical reactions of L-ascorbic acid are reported.

It was constructed around 1990 to test whether human life is possible in this completely sealed, self-sustaining artificial ecosystem. Mainly due to overly rich organic soils, the initial mission failed in a spectacular manner that raised enormous disbelief in the scientific seriousness of the project. From 1995 to 2003, the facility had been operated by Columbia University under a completely new scientific management. The aim of the project had then been to conduct research in the field of ‘experimental climate change science’. Climatic conditions within the mesocosms can be precisely controlled. In studies with elevated CO₂, altered temperature and irrigation regimes performed in the rainforest, coral reef and agriforestry mesocosm, the facility had proven to be a valuable tool for global climate change research. Upon submission of this manuscript, Columbia University is relinquishing the management of this facility now although there was a contract to operate the facility until 2010, leaving it with an unclear destiny that might bring about anything from complete abandonment to a new flowering phase with a new destination.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagroforestry 3abiosphere 3acarbon dioxide 3acarbon dioxide enrichment 3aclimate change 3aclimatic factors 3acoral reefs 3aecosystems 3agreenhouses 3ahumans 3airrigation management 3aorganic soils 3arain forests 3asubtropics 3atemperature 3aArizona1 aCarmen Lambrecht, Susanne0 tJournal of environmental monitoring.g2004 Mar. 31, v. 6, no. 4 p.267-277dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:27191x1464-03337nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/b315788a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02650naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002300148245009600171300001600267500001900283520134200302592002801644650000801672650002001680650000801700650003201708650002001740650004301760650001301803653003401816653002601850653002701876653000901903653001801912700002401930700001901954700002901973773014602002856008302148852000902231655001202240IND60682176120221118231531.0200318e20200402xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068217612DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbrc.2020.01.0752doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDehghanian, Fariba10aDMLR: A toolkit for investigation of deoxyribozyme-mediated ligation based on real time PCR  ap. 405-410.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aDeoxyribozymes or DNAzyme are identified as catalytic DNA sequences which catalyze different chemical reactions. Ligating deoxyribozymes catalyze the formation of branched and linear products. Due to the lack of efficient read-out systems, there is no report on in vivo application of ligating deoxyribozymes. To expand the biological application of branched-RNA forming deoxyribozymes, we performed our study in order to suggest a practical toolkit for measurement of in vivo real-time activity of ligating deoxyribozymes. Further in vitro studies were designed to analyze the effects of the location of branch site on reverse transcriptase (RT) interference. With this toolkit even the activity of RT was measured precisely. Our results indicate that the activity of RT enzyme significantly affected by a 17 nt branched adaptor synthesized by 10DM24 ligating deoxyribozyme. The RT stalls at or near the RNA branch point during both initiation and elongation phases. The DNA synthesis is decreased 4.3 and 2.7 fold during initiation and elongation phases respectively.In conclusion, we introduce a general and practical toolkit called “DMLR” which is based on Real-time PCR method. The use of DMLR precisely determines RT behavior when encountered with any backbone modification with the ability of stopping the enzyme activity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aDNA replication 3aRNA 3aRNA-directed DNA polymerase 3aenzyme activity 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3aresearch 0a10DM24 ligating deoxyribozyme 0aReverse transcriptase 0a2´;-5´;-branched RNA 0aDMLR 0aReal-time PCR1 aNajafi, Zahra Bahri1 aHojati, Zohreh1 aJavadi-Zarnaghi, Fatemeh0 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2020 Apr. 02, v. 524, no. 2 p.405-410dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl46848x0006-291X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2020.01.0753Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01647naa a2200253 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002400139245010600163520078900269592002801058650002001086650002901106650001101135651001401146700001901160773012001179856007301299852000901372655001201381IND60746804020221120122839.0210806e20210727xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074680402DNAL7 a10.3390/w131520492doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLoveridge, Melanie 10aEffects of Probability-Distributed Losses on Flood Estimates Using Event-Based Rainfall-Runoff Models  aProbability distributions of initial losses are investigated using a large dataset of catchments throughout Australia. The variability in design flood estimates caused by probability-distributed initial losses and associated uncertainties are investigated. Based on historic data sets in Australia, the Gamma and Beta distributions are found to be suitable for describing initial loss data. It has also been found that the central tendency of probability-distributed initial loss is more important in design flood estimation than the form of the probability density function. Findings from this study have notable implications on the regionalization of initial loss data, which is required for the application of Monte Carlo methods for design flood estimation in ungauged catchments.  aPublisher supplied data 3adata collection 3aprobability distribution 3arunoff 3aAustralia1 aRahman, Ataur 0 tWater.g2021 July 27, v. 13, no. 15dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21688x2073-44417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w131520493Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02091naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100002000112245011200132300001600244520086700260592002801127650001701155650001301172650003101185650001001216650001601226650001001242650001001252650001801262650001201280650001801292650000901310650002501319650001001344653001801354653002201372653002001394700001401414700001401428700002001442773019801462852000901660655001201669IND60706290420221120042007.0201224e201909  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070629042DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKandpal, Ankita10aExamining the Role of Farm Mechanisation in Enhancing Farmer's Income: A Panel Data Study of Rice and Wheat  ap. 595-601.  aThe escalating wages due to labour scarcity in Indian agriculture is a major challenge in the way of enhancing farmer's income. One way of dealing with the rising labour issue is its substitution with the other power sources. Here, mechanisation is a crucial input in increasing farmers’ income by facilitating timely farm operations, input use efficiency, cropping intensity and farm productivity. In the present study, the status of mechanization and its impact on yield, cropping intensity and profitability in agriculture has been analysed. The time series regression shows an increase in productivity and cropping intensity by 0.575 and 9.649 units, respectively with a unit increase in farm power availability (kW/ha). The panel data regression in paddy and wheat crop has revealed a positive impact of machine use on the profitability of both the crops.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOryza sativa 3aTriticum 3aagricultural mechanization 3acrops 3afarm income 3afarms 3alabor 3amechanization 3apaddies 3aprofitability 3arice 3atime series analysis 3awheat 0aMechanisation 0aFarm productivity 0aFarmer's income1 aKar, Amit1 aJha, G.K.1 aSingh, Premlata0 tJournal of Community Mobilization and Sustainable Development.g2019 Sept., v. 14, no. 3 p.595-601dSociety for Community Mobilization for Sustainable DevelopmentwJournal:2289x2231-67367nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle02422naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100007700146245007600223300001800299500001900317520078700336592002801123650002501151650002101176650002801197650001701225650002201242650001301264650001601277650001601293650002501309650001601334650001901350650001601369650003001385650001401415650001401429653002201443653001901465653002101484653001301505653001001518700002701528700002901555700001901584700006401603773014801667856008001815852000901895655001201904IND60704243320210418000000.0200722e20200619xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070424332DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jafc.0c023892doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPontes, João Guilherme de Moraes1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9369-780910aVirulence Factors in the Phytopathogen–Host Interactions: An Overview  ap. 7555-7570.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aPhytopathogens are responsible for great losses in agriculture, once they are able to subvert or elude the host defense mechanisms through virulence factors secretion for their dissemination.

The most active compound was then assessed for cytotoxicity on human lymphocytes.Six of the tetrahydroisoquinolines showed broad spectrum bacteriostatic activity. The zones of inhibition produced ranged from 7 to 23 mm for 200 μg per disc. The presence of a lipophilic substituent at the para position of the pendant phenyl group conferred the highest antibacterial activity. Compound 2 [1-(3,4-chlorophenyl)-6-hydroxy-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline] was the most active and produced zones ranging from 9 to 20 mm against all eight bacterial strains. Compound 2 also showed the lowest minimum inhibitory concentration of 100 μg/mL against Escherichia coli ATCC11775 and the lowest minimum bactericidal concentration of 800 μg/mL against pathogenic Salmonella typhimurium. Overall, compound 2 was the most active with bacteriostatic and bactericidal activity against three and four bacterial strains respectively. A 50% cytotoxic concentration of 98.2 μg/mL was recorded for compound 2 indicating a low risk of toxicity.The 1-aryl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinolines display structure-related antibacterial activity and further chemical exploration of the tetrahydroisoquinoline scaffold may yield more potent non-toxic derivatives for development into new antibacterials.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3aSalmonella Typhimurium 3aactive ingredients 3aantibacterial properties 3acatalytic activity 3acyclization reactions 3acytotoxicity 3ahumans 3alipophilicity 3aminimum inhibitory concentration 3amoieties 3arisk 3ascreening 3atetrahydroisoquinolines 3avirulent strains 0aAntibiotics 0aDrug discovery 0aAntibacterial agents1 aHanna, Joelle Ngo1 aKomtchou, Julios Armand1 aEfange, Simon Mbua Ngale0 tAsian Pacific Journal of Tropical Biomedicine.g2015 June, v. 5 p.472-477dElsevier B.V.aHainan Medical Universityx2221-16917nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apjtb.2015.03.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02955naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245011300164300001600277500001500293520145800308592002801766650002101794650001001815650002701825650001001852650002001862650003001882650002001912650002101932650001201953650001301965650001701978650001301995650001102008650001202019650002602031650002002057650001202077650002102089650002002110650003102130651001102161653001902172700001502191700001902206700001902225773009102244856008102335852000902416655001202425IND60439568220221117165451.0151024e201509  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6043956822DNAL7 a10.1007/s10681-015-1404-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChalwe, Able10aInheritance of resistance to cassava green mite and other useful agronomic traits in cassava grown in Zambia  ap. 103-119.  a2019-12-06  aCassava green mite (CGM) Mononychellus tanajoa (Bondar) (Acari: Tetranychidae) is a major arthropod pest causing significant loss in the yields of storage roots and planting materials of cassava in Zambia. Its control has been mainly based on the use of exotic predatory mites as biological control agents, which unfortunately, have not established well in Zambia due to the lack of suitable host genotypes and harsh weather conditions. The current study was aimed at breeding cassava for improvement of morphological traits that are associated with resistance to CGM, which can also enable cassava genotypes to provide shelter and ensure continuous survival of natural enemies of CGM, and to determine the inheritance of these traits by assessing combining ability and therefore the type of gene action involved in their expression. Using a 5 × 5 half diallel mating design, full-sib cassava genotypes were generated out of which 300 were selected and evaluated in the field. Data were collected for CGM density, CGM leaf damage and cassava mosaic disease severity, plant growth habit, leaf morphological traits, storage root yield and root dry mass. Both general and specific combining ability effects were significant (P < 0.01) for the reaction of the F₁ progeny to CGM, and for the various plant morphological traits that were measured, suggesting that both additive and non-additive gene effects play a role in the expression of the traits.  aPublisher supplied data 3adiallel analysis 3agenes 3ainheritance (genetics) 3aroots 3apest resistance 3abiological control agents 3apredatory mites 3adisease severity 3aweather 3agenotype 3agrowth habit 3aplanting 3aleaves 3aprogeny 3aMononychellus tanajoa 3aarthropod pests 3acassava 3aagronomic traits 3anatural enemies 3aspecific combining ability 3aZambia 0aplant breeding1 aMelis, Rob1 aShanahan, Paul1 aChiona, Martin0 tEuphytica.g2015 Sept., v. 205, no. 1 p.103-119dSpringer Netherlandsx0014-23367nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10681-015-1404-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01202naa a2200253 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001600149245010200165300001600267520028900283592002800572653001600600653002300616653002600639653002800665773014900693856008500842852000900927655001200936IND60130983420221120223149.0151127s2008    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013098342DNAL7 a10.4289/0013-8797-110.4.9402doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEger, J.

Commonly used substance identifiers are generic names of chemical classes, generic structural formulas, reaction steps, physical–chemical properties, or spectral data. Lack of well‐defined structural information has significantly restricted in silico fate and hazard assessment of UVCB substances. A methodology for the structural description of UVCB substances has been developed that allows use of known identifiers for coding, generation, and selection of representative constituents. The developed formats, Generic Simplified Molecular‐Input Line‐Entry System (G SMILES) and Generic Graph (G Graph), address the need to code, generate, and select representative UVCB constituents; G SMILES is a SMILES‐based single line notation coding fixed and variable structural features of UVCBs, whereas G Graph is based on a workflow paradigm that allows generation of constituents coded in G SMILES and end point–specific or nonspecific selection of representative constituents. Structural description of UVCB substances as afforded by the developed methodology is essential for in silico fate and hazard assessment. Data gap filling approaches such as read‐across, trend analysis, or quantitative structure–activity relationship modeling can be applied to the generated constituents, and the results can be used to assess the substance as a whole. The methodology also advances the application of category‐based data gap filling approaches to UVCB substances.

In the present study, glass transition temperatures (Tg) of isoprene SOA components, including isoprene hydroxy hydroperoxide (ISOPOOH), isoprene-derived epoxydiols (IEPOX), 2-methyltetrols, and 2-methyltetrol sulfates, were measured at atmospherically relevant cooling rates (2–10 K/min) by thin film broadband dielectric spectroscopy. The results indicate that 2-methyltetrol sulfates have the highest glass transition temperature, while ISOPOOH has the lowest glass transition temperature. By varying the cooling rate of the same compound from 2 to 10 K/min, the Tg of these compounds increased by 4–5 K. This temperature difference leads to a height difference of 400–800 m in the atmosphere for the corresponding updraft induced cooling rates, assuming a hygroscopicity value (κ) of 0.1 and relative humidity less than 95%. The Tg of the organic compounds was found to be strongly correlated with volatility, and a semiempirical formula between glass transition temperatures and volatility was derived. The Gordon–Taylor equation was applied to calculate the effect of relative humidity (RH) and water content at five mixing ratios on the Tg of organic aerosols. The model shows that Tg could drop by 15–40 K as the RH changes from <5 to 90%, whereas the mixing ratio of water in the particle increases from 0 to 0.5. These results underscore the importance of chemical composition, updraft rates, and water content (RH) in determining the phase states and hygroscopic properties of organic particles.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaerosols 3adielectric spectroscopy 3aenvironmental science 3aequations 3afilms (materials) 3aglass 3aglass transition 3aglass transition temperature 3ahygroscopicity 3aisoprene 3aliquids 3arelative humidity 3atechnology 3awater content1 aNichman, Leonid1 aSpencer, Peyton1 aJung, Jason I.1 aLee, Andrew1 aHeffernan, Brian K.1 aGold, Avram1 aZhang, Zhenfa1 aChen, Yuzhi1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2547-84281 aCanagaratna, Manjula R.1 aJayne, John T.1 aWorsnop, Douglas R.1 aOnasch, Timothy B.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7796-78401 aSurratt, Jason D.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6833-14501 aChandler, David1 aDavidovits, Paul1 aKolb, Charles E.0 tEnvironmental science & technology.g2019 Sept. 06, v. 53, no. 21 p.12366-12378dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23339x1520-58517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.est.9b033173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02179naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245019700168520085400365592002801219650001301247650001601260650002601276650004201302650001201344653001101356653002001367653004201387653004201429653003901471700006101510700001801571700002001589773011401609856008501723852000901808655001201817IND60678193520221119145245.0200412e20200329xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067819352DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chroma.2019.4607522doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNaghdi, Elahe10aSimultaneous enantioseparation of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs by a one-dimensional liquid chromatography technique using a dynamically coated chiral porous silicon pillar array column  aThe preparation of a highly efficient chiral liquid chromatography (LC) column is explored by dynamically coating a reversed-phase porous silicon pillar array column with hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin (Hp-β-CD) as the chiral selector.

This study was carried out to determine physiological and biochemical responses to variations in environmental conditions of three provenance of Pinus halepensis. Our study consists in particularly to determine the intra-specific variability in water deficit responses of Aleppo pine using gas exchange measurements and biochemical markers such as proline, soluble sugars content, and chlorophyll pigments. The results showed a significant difference between the three provenances of Aleppo pine. The considerable decrease in photosynthetic capacity during the summer season coincides not only with the reduction of stomatal closure but also with a gradual decline in the content of chlorophyll pigments. In addition, a very important accumulation of proline and sugars in the aerial organs was recorded during the summer season, especially in the Italian provenance. Gas exchange exhibited significant differences (p < .05) among the months studied, with the highest values being for March (with greater water availability). Our results underscore the need to consider seasonal drought tolerance when selecting tree species for specific reforestation sites.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPinus halepensis 3achlorophyll 3adrought 3adrought tolerance 3aforests 3agas exchange 3aintraspecific variation 3aphotosynthesis 3aproline 3aprovenance 3areforestation 3astomatal movement 3asummer 3asustainable forestry 3atrees 0aPhotosynthetic rate 0aseasonal changes 0awater use efficiency 0ametabolic and chlorophyll content1 aFkiri, Sondes1 aZouaoui, Refka1 aAloui, Meriem El1 aNasr, Zouhaier0 tJournal of sustainable forestry.g2021 Oct. 03, v. 40, no. 7 p.721-732dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl48967x1540-756X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10549811.2020.18135953Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02912naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100005700146245014100203300001800344500001900362520108000381592002801461650002501489650001901514650001101533650002301544650001301567650003801580650001901618650001201637650001301649650001901662650001901681650002101700650001901721650001601740650001701756650001301773653002301786653003201809653003501841653002401876653002901900700001601929700001601945700001501961700001801976700001501994700005202009700001802061700001802079773014802097856008002245852000902325655001202334IND60704243720221120215540.0200722e20200707xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070424372DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jafc.0c027172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Jianing1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3802-427010aCell Proliferation Stimulation Ability and Osteogenic Activity of Low Molecular Weight Peptides Derived from Bovine Gelatin Hydrolysates  ap. 7630-7640.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aIt has been recognized that collagen peptides of MW 878 Da (CP1) promote osteoblast proliferation and mineralization. The objective of this study is to identify the peptides responsible for proliferation of osteoblast growth, enhancement of ALP (alkaline phosphatase) activity in osteoblasts and promotion of osteoblast mineralization. To this end, the CP1 were fractioned by a series of chromatography procedures, and 51 peptides from the fraction possessing the most powerful cell proliferation ability were identified by LC–MS–MS. The peptides, GPAGPSGPAGK and GPPGSPGPR, were validated on a simultaneous basis as possessing enhanced bioactivity-inducing properties. In particular, the ALP activity of the cells treated with these two peptides was almost twice that of the control cells. Hydrogen bonds were formed, and the hydrophobic interactions with the EGFR (epidermal growth factor receptor) might be responsible for the osteoblast proliferation activity. On this basis, the two peptides might be potential lead compounds against osteoporosis and osteoarthritis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalkaline phosphatase 3abone formation 3acattle 3acell proliferation 3acollagen 3aepidermal growth factor receptors 3afood chemistry 3agelatin 3ahydrogen 3ahydrophobicity 3amineralization 3amolecular weight 3aosteoarthritis 3aosteoblasts 3aosteoporosis 3apeptides 0abioactive peptides 0abovine gelatin hydrolysates 0acell proliferation stimulation 0aosteogenic activity 0atandem mass spectrometry1 aZhang, Bing1 aLu, Weipeng1 aLiu, Junli1 aZhang, Weijie1 aWang, Yihu1 aMa, Ming1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6957-56441 aCao, Xiaofeng1 aGuo, Yanchuan0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2020 July 07, v. 68, no. 29 p.7630-7640dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:12177x1520-51187nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jafc.0c027173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02669naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100003100151245008500182300001800267520151300285592002801798650001201826650001001838650001101848650002201859650001301881650002301894650001001917650001601927653001101943653001301954653001301967653001001980653001201990653001602002700002002018773013902038856008502177852000902262655001202271IND60524288420221119171252.0160706e20161002xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052428842DNAL7 a10.1080/10942912.2015.10867862doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNizamlioglu, Nizam Mustafa10aKinetic of Color Changes in Almond (Akbadem Variety) During Roasting and Storage  ap. 2363-2376.  aIn this research, the color change kinetics of the Akbadem variety during roasting and storage processes was investigated. The roasting process was carried out at three different temperatures (150, 160, and 170°C) and four different times 10, 20, 30, and 40 min. Then, roasted samples were separated in two groups and stored for 6 months in 4 and 22°C. All of the color parameters reactions during roasting and storage took place according to first order reaction kinetics. L - and hue angle-values tended to decrease linear significantly during roasting. The L -values of Akbadem samples roasted at 150, 160,and 170°C for 40 min was determined as 52.34 ± 2.53, 47.96 ± 1.35, and 43.17 ± 0.09, respectively. The highest Ea -value was determined on the L -value as 14.80 ± 4.26. The a, b , ΔE , metric chroma (C), and metric saturation (S) values increased during roasting. L -, C -, a -, b -, and S -values tended to decrease linear significantly during storage. The L -, a -, and b -values of Akbadem samples which were roasted at 170°C and stored at 4°C for 6 months were decreased from 43.17 ± 0.09, 14.25 ± 0.026, and 29.53 ± 0.06 to 34.91 ± 0.13, 10.06 ± 0.15, and 15.93 ± 0.12, respectively. According to sensory analysis, the panelists gave low scores as taste (1.9 ± 0.88), color (2.1 ± 0.57), and flavor (2.4 ± 0.7) for Akbadem samples roasted at 170°C for 40 min. ΔE was increased during storage Ea-values were decreased during roasting and storage at 4 and 22°C for 6 months.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalmonds 3acolor 3aflavor 3areaction kinetics 3aroasting 3asensory evaluation 3ataste 3atemperature 0aAlmond 0aRoasting 0aKinetics 0aColor 0aStorage 0aSnack foods1 aNas, Sebahattin0 tInternational journal of food properties.g2016 Oct. 2, v. 19, no. 10 p.2363-2376dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl56717x1094-29127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10942912.2015.10867863Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03399naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002500147245011300172300001400285500001500299520190300314592002802217650001202245650003302257650001202290650001602302650001402318650003302332650001102365650001402376650001702390650001102407650002702418650001402445650001802459650002202477650001602499650001102515650001902526650002102545651001302566651001902579651001202598651001402610700002002624700002002644773012602664856008202790852000902872655001202881IND60516398320221121033849.0190727e201401  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051639832DNAL7 a10.1017/S00144797130003792doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAL SHAREEF, IBRAHEEM10aTemperature and drought stress effects on growth and development of bambara groundnut (vigna subterranea l.)  ap. 72-89.  a2019-12-06  aThe effect of drought and temperature on the growth and development of bambara groundnut (Vigna subterranea (L.) Verdc.) was studied in controlled environment glasshouses in the United Kingdom. There were two landraces, S19-3 (from a hot, dry environment; Namibia) and Uniswa Red (from a cool, wet environment; Swaziland), two temperature regimes (23 °C and 33 °C) and three watering regimes (2006; fully irrigated), 2007 (drought imposed at 77 days after sowing (DAS)) and 2008 (drought imposed at 30 DAS)). Bambara groundnut responded to drought by slowing the rate of leaf area expansion and reducing final canopy size and total dry matter (TDM). Drought also caused significant reductions in pod dry matter, pod numbers and harvest index (HI), leading to a decrease in final yield that was different between landraces. Throughout the three growing seasons, landraces grown at 33 °C produced more TDM than the landraces grown at 23 °C. The two landraces differed in their phenology; S19-3 exhibited a reduced phenology where leaf numbers started to decrease before Uniswa Red at both temperatures, while Uniswa Red maintained the longest life cycle. The lowest pod yield was produced by Uniswa Red in 2008 at 33 °C (maximum of 35.5 gm⁻²), while S19-3 produced a minimum pod yield of 56.6 gm⁻² at 33 °C, also in 2008. However, both landraces produced considerably more pod yield at 23 °C throughout the three growing seasons (minimum of 151 gm⁻² and 162 gm⁻² for Uniswa Red and S19-3, respectively). Under moderate drought, S19-3 at 33 °C gave the highest pod yield (365 gm⁻²) among the treatments throughout the three growing seasons and maintained HI better under drought. Despite being from a hot, dry environment, S19-3 also performed well at low temperature, which indicates the adaptation of S19-3 to low temperature that it also experiences in the country of origin.  aPublisher supplied data 3apeanuts 3adry environmental conditions 3adrought 3agreenhouses 3alandraces 3awet environmental conditions 3asowing 3aphenology 3awater stress 3aleaves 3agrowth and development 3aleaf area 3aharvest index 3aVigna subterranea 3atemperature 3acanopy 3agrowing season 3airrigation rates 3aEswatini 3aUnited Kingdom 3aNamibia 0aSwaziland1 aSPARKES, DEBBIE1 aAZAM-ALI, SAYED0 tExperimental agriculture.g2014 Jan., v. 50, no. 1 p.72-89dCambridge University PresswJournal:jnl46155x1469-44417nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S00144797130003793Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03412naa a2200661 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245010700169500001900276520157300295592002801868650004801896650002401944650001301968650002401981650001102005650003402016650001302050650001302063650001802076653003802094653001002132653000902142653000802151653000802159653000802167653001002175653000802185653000902193653000802202653000702210653000802217653000802225653000902233653000802242653000802250653001002258653000802268700002102276700002302297700001802320700003502338700002502373700002902398700002102427700001802448700002602466700001902492700002202511773011402533856008202647852000902729655001202738IND60720504620221119012941.0210312e202104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072050462DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jim.2020.1129412doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlonso, Natàlia,10aDevelopment of a lateral flow immunochromatography test for the rapid detection of bovine tuberculosis  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aDetection of specific antibodies would be a useful test strategy for bovine tuberculosis (bTB) as a complement to the single skin test. We developed a lateral flow immunochromatography (LFIC) test for rapid bTB detection based on the use of a conjugate of gold nanoparticles with a recombinant G protein. After evaluating 3 Mycobacterium bovis (MB) antigens: ESAT-6, CFP-10 and MPB83 for the control line, we selected MPB83 given it was the most specific. The performance of the test was analyzed with 820 bovine sera, 40 sera corresponding to healthy animals, 5 sera from animals infected with Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis (MAP) and 775 sera of animals from herds with bTB. All these sera were also submitted to a validated bTB-ELISA using whole-cell antigen from MB. From the 775 sera of animals from herds with bTB, 87 sera were positive by the bTB-ELISA, 45 were positive by LFIC and only 5 animals were positives by skin test (TST). To confirm bTB infection in the group of TST (−), bTB-ELISA (+) and LFIC (+) animals, we performed postmortem examination in 15 randomly selected animals. Macroscopically, these 15 animals had numerous small and large yellow-white granulomas, characteristic of bTB, and the infection was subsequently confirmed by PCR in these tissues with lesions (gold standard).No false positive test result was detected with the developed LFIC either with the sera from healthy animals or from animals infected with MAP demonstrating that it can be a useful technique for the rapid identification of animals infected with bTB.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis 3aMycobacterium bovis 3aantigens 3abovine tuberculosis 3acattle 3aimmunoaffinity chromatography 3ananogold 3anecropsy 3arapid methods 0aLateral flow immunochromatography 0aMPB83 0aABTS 0aBSA 0abTB 0aELC 0aELISA 0aIgs 0aLFIC 0aMAP 0aMB 0aMTC 0aPBS 0aPBST 0aTBS 0aTST 0aT-TBS 0aWCA1 aGriffa, Natanael1 aMoyano, Roberto D.1 aMon, Maria L.1 aColombatti Olivieri, María A.1 aBarandiaran, Soledad1 aVivot, Marcela Martínez1 aFiorini, Gonzalo1 aCanal, Ana M.1 aSantangelo, María P.1 aSingh, Mahavir1 aRomano, María I.0 tJournal of immunological methods.g2021 Apr., v. 491 p.112941-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12466x0022-17597nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jim.2020.1129413Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02631naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001600152245013400168300001600302520150500318592002801823650002501851650001101876650002201887650001401909650001101923650001001934650001101944653001501955653002601970653002601996653002102022700001902043773011102062856008702173852000902260655001202269IND60561739220221117221204.0190318e201704  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056173922DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jinsphys.2017.01.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJia, Lei-Po13aAn apposition compound eye adapted for nocturnal vision in the moth midge Clogmia albipunctata (Williston) (Diptera: Psychodidae)  ap. 188-198.  aMorphology and anatomy, dark/light adaptational changes and optics of the compound eyes of the nocturnal moth midge Clogmia albipunctata (Williston) are studied. Its apposition type of eye consists of approximately 260 well-separated ommatidia. Each ommatidium features a biconvex corneal lens covered by corneal nipples measuring around 17nm in height; a crystalline cone of the acone type; and an open (laterally fused) rhabdom formed by eight retinular cells (R1-R8). The corneal lens, whose biological significance is addressed, is composed of a thick yellow-coloured inner lens unit (ILU) surrounded by a thin, colourless outer lens unit (OLU). We identified two types of ommatidia: dorsally located T-type ommatidia and ventrally located P-type ommatidia. In the T-type ommatidia, the rhabdomeres of the retinular cells R7 and R8 are centrally located and are arranged in tandem with R7 above R8. In comparison, in the P-type ommatidia, only the R8 rhabdomere is central, whereas the R7 rhabdomere locates in the peripheral ring. Above the distal tip of the rhabdom, the crystalline cone and the PPCs form an aperture that dynamically changes its size under dark/light conditions, thus modulating the amount of light that reaches the photoreceptive layer. The Clogmia albipunctata eye has a low F-number of 1.2, a high interommatidial angle of 11° and a large eye parameter of 4.6μm·rad. The eye is characterized by relatively poor spatial resolution, but exhibits high absolute sensitivity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aClogmia albipunctata 3acornea 3ainsect physiology 3aommatidia 3aoptics 3ateats 3avision 0aMoth midge 0aColoured corneal lens 0aDark/light adaptation 0aNocturnal vision1 aLiang, Ai-Ping0 tJournal of insect physiology.g2017 Apr., v. 98 p.188-198dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl45772x0022-19107nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jinsphys.2017.01.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02032naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245016600163300001400329520096600343592002801309650002501337650001201362650002001374650001301394650001801407650001901425650001101444650001601455700001701471773009301488856008101581990002301662852000901685655001201694IND60093404820221118172052.0141103e20120305xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009340482DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ces.2011.05.0422doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMa, Chao Y.10aModel identification of crystal facet growth kinetics in morphological population balance modeling of l-glutamic acid crystallization and experimental validation  ap. 22-30.  aMorphological population balance (PB) modeling of crystallization processes predicts the dynamic evolution of shape distribution of crystals grown from solution.

This paper investigates model identification techniques for deriving size-dependent facet growth kinetics models as functions of supersaturation and size of the crystal. Cooling crystallizations experiments were carried out with solution concentration and temperature recorded. The seeds and obtained product crystals were characterized for shape and size distributions using an integrated particle dispersion–imaging system. The models obtained were tested using experimental data of crystallization of the same chemical under different cooling conditions. During all experiments an on-line imaging instrument was applied to obtaining real-time images for the purpose of qualitative comparison with model predicted shape distribution.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemical engineering 3acooling 3acrystallization 3acrystals 3aglutamic acid 3aimage analysis 3amodels 3atemperature1 aWang, Xue Z.0 tChemical engineering science.g2012 Mar. 5, v. 70 p.22-30dElsevier Ltdx0009-25097nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ces.2011.05.0423Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02645naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245014400167300001600311520138100327592002801708650002301736650001501759650001601774650001501790650002101805650002601826650001801852650001301870650002501883650001601908650001101924650001201935651001101947700001701958700002001975700002101995773012802016856008202144852000902226655001202235IND60516398620221121033848.0190727e201401  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051639862DNAL7 a10.1017/S00144797130004222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBESLEMES, D.

Experimental sites were located in central Greece on a fertile, clayey to loamy textured soil, and on a sandy soil of moderate fertility. A factorial combination of four nitrogen application rates (0, 50, 100, 150 kg ha⁻¹) and three legume treatments (incorporated into the topsoil or harvested before the sowing of sorghum and mono-cropping) were tested in a split plot design in three blocks. The results showed importance of legume cover crops for both soil types as sorghum total dry biomass yield for clayey soil fluctuated from 23 to 27 t ha⁻¹ for control plots, from 25.2 to 30.9 t ha⁻¹ when faba bean was harvested and from 26.3 to 32.5 t ha⁻¹ when incorporated, and for sandy soil the yield fluctuated from 18.1 to 22.1 t ha⁻¹ for control plots, from 22 to 27 t ha⁻¹ when faba bean was harvested and from 23.1 to 28.1 t ha⁻¹ when incorporated. The NUE was estimated at 62 kg kg⁻¹ and 60 kg kg⁻¹ for clayey and sandy soils respectively. The N recovery fraction was doubled after incorporating faba bean as green manure, reaching large amounts for both soil types.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiomass production 3aclay soils 3acover crops 3afaba beans 3afertilizer rates 3afield experimentation 3agreen manures 3anitrogen 3anitrogen fertilizers 3asandy soils 3asowing 3atopsoil 3aGreece1 aTIGKA, E.

Recent results support the use of zebrafish as a model for studying the pathophysiology of mycobacterial infection and for the development of novel interventions for tuberculosis (TB) control. Recently, we showed that oral immunization with the heat-inactivated M. bovis vaccine (M. bovis IV) protect wild boar against TB, and suggested that this vaccine may controls mycobacterial infection in other species.In this study we evaluated the effect of M. bovis IV on the control of mycobacteriosis in zebrafish mucosally vaccinated by immersion and challenged intraperitoneally with Mycobacterium marinum.The results showed that the M. bovis IV administered by immersion protected zebrafish against mycobacteriosis caused by M. marinum by reduction in mycobacterial infection, the number of mycobacteria per granuloma and the number of granulomas per fish. An IgM antibody response against M. bovis antigens was developed in vaccinated fish. Evidences suggested that the protective mechanism elicited by mucosal vaccination with M. bovis IV in zebrafish was based on the activation of the innate immune response through the C3 pathway.These results support the use of the M. bovis IV administered by immersion for the control of mycobacteriosis in fish.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDanio rerio 3aMycobacterium bovis 3aMycobacterium marinum 3aantibodies 3aantigens 3adisease control 3afish 3agranuloma 3aimmunoglobulin M 3ainnate immunity 3amodels 3aoral vaccination 3apathophysiology 3atuberculosis 3avaccines 3awild boars 0aZebrafish 0aImmersion 0aMucosa 0aVaccine 0aMycobacterium 0aComplement component 3 0aInnate immune response1 aLópez, Vladimir1 aContreras, Marinela1 aMateos-Hernández, Lourdes1 aGortázar, Christian1 aFuente, José de la,0 tVaccine.g2018 July 16, v. 36, no. 30 p.4447-4453dElsevier LtdwJournal:6210x0264-410X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2018.06.0423Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02779naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002700147245009100174300001600265500001500281520131700296592002801613650001601641650002601657650002601683650001501709650001401724650001601738650001301754650001201767650002301779650000901802650001001811650000701821650001901828650001201847650002301859650001901882650001001901650002201911650002501933650001501958653002001973700001901993700002002012700001702032773012202049856008102171852000902252655001202261IND60519195220221123045121.0160421e201605  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051919522DNAL7 a10.1007/s00449-016-1564-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLeonhardt, Robin-Hagen10aHeterologous production of the stain solving peptidase PPP1 from Pleurotus pulmonarius  ap. 845-853.  a2019-12-06  aA novel stain solving subtilisin-like peptidase (PPP1) was identified from the culture supernatant of the agaricomycete Pleurotus pulmonarius. It was purified to homogeneity using a sequence of preparative isoelectric focusing, anion exchange and size exclusion chromatography. Peptides were identified by ab initio sequencing (nLC-ESI-QTOF-MS/MS), characterizing the enzyme as a member of the subtilase family (EC 3.4.21.X). An expression system was established featuring the pPIC9K vector, an alternative Kozak sequence, the codon optimized gene ppp1 gene without the native signal sequence with C-terminal hexa-histidine tag, and Pichia pastoris GS115 as expression host. Intracellular active enzyme was obtained from cultivations in shake flasks and in a five liter bioreactor. With reaction optima of 40 °C and a pH > 8.5, considerable bleaching of pre-stained fabrics (blood, milk and India ink), and the possibility of larger-scale production, the heterologous enzyme is well suitable for detergent applications, especially at lower temperatures as part of a more energy- and cost-efficient washing process. Showing little sequence similarity to other subtilases, this unique peptidase is the first subtilisin-like peptidase from Basidiomycota, which has been functionally produced in Pichia pastoris.  aPublisher supplied data 3atemperature 3aPleurotus pulmonarius 3aKomagataella pastoris 3acontainers 3ableaching 3abioreactors 3apeptides 3awashing 3agel chromatography 3amilk 3agenes 3apH 3aanion exchange 3afabrics 3acost effectiveness 3asignal peptide 3ablood 3asequence homology 3aisoelectric focusing 3adetergents 0aPichia pastoris1 aKrings, Ulrich1 aBerger, Ralf G.1 aLinke, Diana0 tBioprocess and biosystems engineering.g2016 May, v. 39, no. 5 p.845-853dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx1615-75917nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00449-016-1564-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02304naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002100151245012900172300001800301520079800319592002801117650002401145650001901169650001701188650003101205650002901236650002101265650001901286650002101305650001601326650002101342650002301363650002701386650001401413653001301427653001801440653001501458653001701473653001901490700002701509700001701536700001801553700001801571773013901589856008501728852000901813655001201822IND60524288820221119171311.0160706e20161002xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052428882DNAL7 a10.1080/10942912.2015.11144922doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMandour, Yasmine10aStructural Docking Studies of COX-II Inhibitory Activity for Metabolites Derived from Corchorus olitorius and Vitis vinifera  ap. 2377-2384.  aDietary phenolics have remarkable attention as potential anti-inflammatory agents. This study investigated cyclooxygenase inhibitory activity of nutraceuticals isolated from hydroalcohol extract of Corchorus olitorius L . (Co) and Vitis vinifera L. (Vv). Molecular docking calculations using AutoDock Vina was used to evaluate the binding mode of these nutraceuticals and its major derivatives in the active site of both cyclooxygenase enzymes. In vitro studies showed that quercetin derivatives exhibit a recognizable selective inhibition of cyclooxygenase-II (60%) compared to cyclooxygenase-I (37%). Results showed quercetin ability to explore extra hydrophobic pocket present in the structure of cyclooxygenase-II enzyme, thus explaining its potential selectivity toward cyclooxygenase-II.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCorchorus olitorius 3aVitis vinifera 3aactive sites 3aanti-inflammatory activity 3aanti-inflammatory agents 3afunctional foods 3ahydrophobicity 3ain vitro studies 3ametabolites 3amolecular models 3aphenolic compounds 3aprostaglandin synthase 3aquercetin 0aAutoDock 0aEdible plants 0aFlavanoids 0aInflammation 0aNutraceuticals1 aHandoussa, Heba Ahmad,1 aSwilam, Noha1 aHanafi, Rasha1 aMahran, Laila0 tInternational journal of food properties.g2016 Oct. 2, v. 19, no. 10 p.2377-2384dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl56717x1094-29127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10942912.2015.11144923Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02538naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245014300165300001600308520122100324592002801545650002201573650001201595650001601607650001401623650001301637650001601650650001501666650001701681650002701698650001101725650003001736650002501766650001901791650002801810650001001838700001601848700001201864700001901876700001601895773009101911856008102002852000902083655001202092IND60439569020221123030043.0151024e201509  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6043956902DNAL7 a10.1007/s10681-015-1457-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWan, Hongshen10aMapping a major QTL for hairy leaf sheath introgressed from Aegilops tauschii and its association with enhanced grain yield in bread wheat  ap. 275-285.  aAegilops tauschii, the diploid D genome progenitor of the hexaploid wheat, has been used to improve modern common wheat by creating synthetic hexaploid wheat (SHW) as a bridging mechanism for wheat breeding. Most Ae. tauschii accessions have hairiness on the leaf sheath, whereas the hexaploid common wheat is usually glabrous. In this study a major QTL for leaf sheath hairiness (LSH) was detected on the long arm of chromosome 4D in two recombinant inbred line (RIL) populations produced from SHW-derived cultivar Chuanmai 42. The QTL peak was flanked by markers Xbarc48 and Xbarc1183/D_GB5Y7FA01AGCKH_224, and explained more than 75 % of the phenotypic variation. The QTL allele for LSH was contributed by Chuanmai 42, and originated from Ae. tauschii. In both RIL populations the QTL allele producing hairy leaf sheath was significantly and positively associated with increased grain yield, grain weight and grain weight per spike. Moreover, most Chuanmai 42-derived cultivars have inherited the hairy leaf sheath character. These findings suggest that the hairy leaf sheath gene in Chuanmai 42 can be applied in marker-assisted selection (MAS) as a morphologically selectable marker in breeding for high yield.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAegilops tauschii 3aalleles 3achromosomes 3acultivars 3adiploidy 3agrain yield 3ahexaploidy 3ainbred lines 3ainheritance (genetics) 3aleaves 3amarker-assisted selection 3aphenotypic variation 3aplant breeding 3aquantitative trait loci 3awheat1 aYang, Yumin1 aLi, Jun1 aZhang, Zhefeng1 aYang, Wuyun0 tEuphytica.g2015 Sept., v. 205, no. 1 p.275-285dSpringer Netherlandsx0014-23367nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10681-015-1457-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02177naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001400147245011400161300001400275520097200289592002801261650001801289650001201307650004301319650001601362650001501378650001101393650000701404650002301411650002101434653002601455653001701481653001901498653001601517653001501533653001901548700001501567773009301582856008301675852000901758655001201767IND60479763120221119180354.0160123e20070301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6047976312DNAL7 a10.1556/AAlim.36.2007.1.72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRomeo, F.10aAbility of commercially available lactobacillus strains as starter in brining and debittering of table olives  ap. 49-60.  aThe adaptation to brining conditions of 20 strains of Lactobacilli were tested.

Aspects on procedural fairness, monetary compensation and behavioral simulation in China’s land expropriation story  ap. 166-178.  aFarmland expropriation and the associated satisfaction or otherwise of farmers has been receiving increased attention under the background of China's rapid urbanization. We use a literature review to identify specific gaps that need to be filled: (1) where and how the satisfaction of land expropriation comes from? (2) how to effectively measure the level of satisfaction? The evaluation of satisfaction is considered to come from three stages of pre, during and post expropriation. This paper aims to examine two groups of land-taken and land-kept farmers by using the binary nonlinear model, logit and order-Probit regression, blinder-Oaxaca decomposition and Heckman two-step selection as the data analysis method. Two research questions are raised in an extended Institutional Analysis and Development (IAD) framework, including: 1) which factors mostly affect farmer's willingness and satisfaction in the IAD framework? and 2) what is the marginal effect of different factors, especially of the interaction between land compensation standards and the openness and fairness of expropriation procedures? The four main results indicate that, firstly, improvement in the compensation criterion is helpful for improving the level of satisfaction, but does not mean that higher compensation is better, because empirical research indicates that simply increasing the amount of compensation does not significantly increase satisfaction unless the farmers are consulted over the land-acquisition procedures and compensation amounts. Second, the most important aspect for the farmers is how much their income level increases, ‘inequality rather than want is the cause of trouble’ and, in the absence of any consultation, ‘waiting for the right place to sell' in the next round. Third, compensation should be allocated to the farmer instead of the rural collective. Fourth, according to the theories of resource endowment and reference dependence, to explicate the negative effect between the strength and perception of property rights, it is considered that the inter-relationship between land ownership and farmland circulation is uncertain. Whether the influence is positive or negative mostly depends on the strength of the property rights, institutional environment, behavioral cognitive ability and the capability to implement or act.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural land 3acognition 3aempirical research 3afarmers 3aincome 3aland ownership 3anonlinear models 3aproperty rights 3aurbanization 3aChina 0aIAD framework 0aLand expropriation 0aWillingness 0aSatisfaction 0aProcedures 0aFairness 0aCompensation benchmark1 aZhang, Xiaoling0 tLand use policy.g2018 May, v. 74 p.166-178dElsevier LtdwJournal:12412x0264-83777nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.landusepol.2017.08.0273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02783naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001300149245008500162500001900247520143600266592002801702650001101730650002301741650002501764650001801789650001501807650001301822650000901835650001001844650001201854650001101866650001701877650000901894650001501903650001801918653002801936653002501964653002401989653002302013653002602036700001502062700002302077700001402100773009402114856008402208852000902292655001202301IND60714953720221119231050.0201209e202012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071495372DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enpol.2020.1119122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aElia, A.10aWind turbine cost reduction: A detailed bottom-up analysis of innovation drivers  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aWind energy technologies have seen a rapid decline in costs in the last two decades, but the drivers for these cost reductions are poorly understood. This paper addresses this knowledge gap by quantitatively investigating the drivers behind the cost reductions of onshore wind turbines between 2005 and 2017. Starting from a bottom-up cost model, the paper advances the methodology by identifying the techno-economic variables responsible for cost reductions of individual components (in $/kW) and linking them to drivers, specifically: learning by-deployment, learning-by-researching, supply-chain dynamics, and market dynamics. The analysis finds that changes in materials (copper, fiberglass, and iron), labour (employee productivity), legal and financial costs contributed over 30% to the cost reduction of wind turbine prices over the period 2005–2017. Moreover, learning-by-deployment was the most important innovation driver, being responsible for half of the cost reduction. The findings point to the importance of policies tailored to technology's stage of development. For onshore wind energy, which entered a mature phase in the period covered by this analysis, policy support for the needs of a growing industry such as stable support schemes together with appropriate regulatory and investment environments were more important than direct policy support for R&D which played a more important role in earlier periods.  aPublisher supplied data 3acopper 3acost effectiveness 3adevelopmental stages 3aenergy policy 3afiberglass 3aindustry 3airon 3alabor 3amarkets 3amodels 3asupply chain 3awind 3awind power 3awind turbines 0aOnshore wind technology 0aBottom-up cost model 0aTechnology learning 0aInnovation drivers 0aTechnology innovation1 aTaylor, M.1 aÓ Gallachóir, B.1 aRogan, F.0 tEnergy policy.g2020 Dec., v. 147 p.111912-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12439x0301-42157nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enpol.2020.1119123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02627naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024005500094040001800149100002300167245019700190300001600387520139900403592002801802653001901830653000801849653000801857653001401865653002301879700002301902700003001925700002201955700002101977700002101998700002302019773012002042856010602162852000902268655001202277IND60131238020221119054022.0180907e200709  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013123802DNAL7 a10.1672/0277-5212(2007)27[462:CHAEPT]2.0.CO;22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWhigham, Dennis F.10aCombining hgm and emap procedures to assess wetlands at the watershed scale —— status of flats and non-tidal riverine wetlands in the nanticoke river watershed, delaware and maryland (usa)  ap. 462-478.  aThe hydrogeomorphic (HGM) approach to wetland assessment was combined with the Environmental Monitoring and Assessment Program (EMAP) survey design procedures to evaluate the condition of non-tidal riverine and flats wetlands in the Nanticoke River watershed (Delaware and Maryland, USA). We found degradation of wetland functions below reference standard levels for the majority of wetlands in both classes. Wetland condition was also related to the level of disturbance in both wetland classes. In flats, the most common disturbances were associated with hydrologic and vegetation modifications. Flat wetlands with low HGM function scores for the Plant Community and Habitat functions had almost all been converted from hardwood forest to Loblolly pine plantations. Most modifications associated with riverine wetlands were associated with stream channelization. Results of this study demonstrate that a site-specific and reference-based approach to assessment (i.e., the HGM method) can successfully be applied at the scale of an entire watershed if it is combined with a sampling approach that allows sites to be selected without geographic bias. The approach can also be used to determine if wetland functions vary from one sub-basin to another, and results of this project can be used by managers to begin to develop strategies for restoration of wetland functions at the watershed scale.  aPublisher supplied data 0aChesapeake Bay 0aGIS 0aHGM 0awatershed 0awetland assessment1 aDeller Jacobs, Amy1 aWeller, Donq(Donald E.),1 aJordan, Thomas E.1 aKentula, Mary E.1 aJensen, Susan F.1 aStevens, Donald L.0 tWetlands.g2007 Sept., v. 27, no. 3 p.462-478dThe Society of Wetland ScientistswJournal:jnl57834x0277-52127nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1672/0277-5212(2007)27%5B462:CHAEPT%5D2.0.CO;23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01795naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245011900171300001600290520068500306592002800991650001501019650001301034650002101047650001701068651001001085653001801095653002101113653001001134653002601144653002801170653001601198773013601214856008601350852000901436655001201445IND60634492920221117225727.0190402e20190504xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063449292DNAL7 a10.1080/07900627.2017.13547612doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGrassini, Laura10aParticipatory water governance between theories and practices: learning from a community-based initiative in India  ap. 404-429.  aDespite increasing convergence on the social learning concept as a theoretical foundation of collaborative practices for water governance, this article shows the pitfalls of its uncritical application as a normative ideal.

Finally, a recommendation for context-specific selection of theoretical bases for participatory practices is made.  aPublisher supplied data 3agovernance 3alearning 3awater management 3awater supply 3aIndia 0aParticipation 0awater governance 0aIndia 0acommunity perspective 0acollaborative practices 0aempowerment0 tInternational journal of water resources development.g2019 May 4, v. 35, no. 3 p.404-429dRoutledgewJournal:2050x1360-06487nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/07900627.2017.13547613Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01591naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001400149245013400163300001600297520038400313592002800697650001400725650001100739650001400750650001600764651001300780653001600793653001400809653001500823653001400838653001600852653001300868700001900881773023600900856008401136852000901220655001201229IND60543649520221119183231.0190411e201509  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054364952DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aspen.2015.06.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aQi, MuJie10aTaxonomic study of the genus Epicrocis Zeller (Lepidoptera, Pyralidae, Phycitinae) in Cambodia, with description of a new species  ap. 577-581.  aThe species of the genus Epicrocis Zeller, 1848 are revised from Cambodia in the present study.

We investigated herein two phenotypically and geographically distinct populations of this breed, namely Nyalawi and Daeinawi, which are renowned for their unique meat production capabilities and adaptation attributes, with the aim to contribute to our understanding of their maternal genetic diversity and demography dynamics. Genetic polymorphism analysis of the full‐length D‐loop mtDNA region revealed 44 and 35 polymorphic sites defining 28 and 24 distinct haplotypes in the Nyalawi and the Daeinawi, respectively. Observed genetic diversity is high within the population with a low level of genetic differentiation between populations. Approximate Bayesian computation via the calculation of Bayesian skyline plots and neutrality tests support past expansion with a higher maternal effective population size (Nₑ) in Nyalawi compared with the Daeinawi population and a population expansion beginning around 4,500 YBP and 3,500 YBP, respectively, before the arrival of zebu into the continent.  aPublisher supplied data  a16K21431cJapan Society for the Promotion of Science  a1/2017cMinistry of Higher Education, Sudan and Scientific Research 3aBayesian theory 3ademography 3aeffective population size 3agenetic polymorphism 3agenetic variation 3ahaplotypes 3ameat production 3apopulation growth 3azebu 3aSudan1 aAbdelrahim, Amina E.1 aHanotte, Olivier1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2877-47671 aNakao, Ryo1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3105-76031 aAlkhaibari, Abeer M.1 aSalim, Bashir1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3665-22170 tJournal of animal breeding and genetics.g2022 Mar., v. 139, no. 2 p.161-169dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl57793x0931-26687nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jbg.126483Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03759naa a2200721 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003800113040001800151100001800169245015000187300001800337520141700355592002801772650001701800650000901817650001901826650002001845650001001865650001601875650001801891650002101909650001101930650004301941650001401984650001901998650003402017650002302051650003402074650002402108650002902132650004202161650003102203650003702234650003002271650002702301650004202328650002402370650002402394650004202418650001302460650001702473650003402490650003102524653003202555653002102587653002502608653004002633653002102673653002502694700002202719700002302741700002302764700001802787700001902805700002502824773008302849856008402932852000903016655001203025IND60088328220221116174044.0160901e20130501xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008832822DNAL7 a234900982pmid7 a10.1016/j.watres.2013.02.0162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBælum, Jacob12aA conceptual model linking functional gene expression and reductive dechlorination rates of chlorinated ethenes in clay rich groundwater sediment  ap. 2467-2478.  aWe used current knowledge of cellular processes involved in reductive dechlorination to develop a conceptual model to describe the regulatory system of dechlorination at the cell level; the model links bacterial growth and substrate consumption to the abundance of messenger RNA of functional genes involved in the dechlorination process. The applicability of the model was tested on a treatability study of biostimulated and bioaugmented microcosms. Using quantitative real time PCR, high-resolution expression profiles of the functional reductive dehalogenase genes bvcA and vcrA were obtained during two consecutive dechlorination events of trichlorethene, cis-dichlorethene and vinyl chloride. Up-regulation of the bvcA (for the biostimulated microcosms) and vcrA (for the bioaugmented microcosms) gene expression fitted well with high rates of dechlorination of vinyl chloride, while no known transcripts could be measured during trichloroethene and cis-dichlorethene dechlorination. Maximum concentrations of 2.1 and 1.7 transcripts per gene of the bvcA and vcrA genes, respectively, were measured at the same time points as maximum dechlorination rates were observed. The developed model compared well with the experimental data for both biostimulated and bioaugmented microcosms under non-steady state conditions and was supported by results from a recently published study under steady state conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3achlorination 3aclay 3adechlorination 3agene expression 3agenes 3agroundwater 3amessenger RNA 3amicrobial growth 3amodels 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3asediments 3avinyl chloride 2aAluminum Silicatesxchemistry 2aBacteriaxgenetics 2aBiodegradation, Environmental 2aComputer Simulation 2aDNA, Bacterialxgenetics 2aGene Expression Regulation, Bacterial 2aGenes, Bacterialxgenetics 2aGeologic Sedimentsxmicrobiology 2aGroundwaterxmicrobiology 2aHalogenationxgenetics 2aHydrocarbons, Chlorinatedxmetabolism 2aModels, Theoretical 2aOxidation-Reduction 2aRNA, Messengerxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aSolvents 2aTime Factors 2aTrichloroethylenexmetabolism 2aVinyl Chloridexmetabolism 0aMolecular microbial ecology 0aConceptual model 0aDechlorination genes 0amRNA extraction from clay rich soil 0aQuantitative PCR 0aDehalococcoides spp.1 aChambon, Julie C.1 aScheutz, Charlotte1 aBinning, Philip J.1 aLaier, Troels1 aBjerg, Poul L.1 aJacobsen, Carsten S.0 tWater research.g2013 May 01, v. 47 p.2467-2478dElsevier Ltdx0043-13547nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.watres.2013.02.0163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02196naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245007800166300001800244520109400262592002801356650000801384650001801392650001501410653004301425653002901468653001401497653001901511653001801530653002001548700001501568700001801583700001301601773012801614856008301742852000901825655001201834IND60754693520221120115316.0211219s2021    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075469352DNAL7 a10.1016/j.csbj.2021.10.0272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXie, Bingbing10aAutomatic cell type identification methods for single-cell RNA sequencing  ap. 5874-5887.  aSingle-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has become a powerful tool for scientists of many research disciplines due to its ability to elucidate the heterogeneous and complex cell-type compositions of different tissues and cell populations. Traditional cell-type identification methods for scRNA-seq data analysis are time-consuming and knowledge-dependent for manual annotation. By contrast, automatic cell-type identification methods may have the advantages of being fast, accurate, and more user friendly. Here, we discuss and evaluate thirty-two published automatic methods for scRNA-seq data analysis in terms of their prediction accuracy, F1-score, unlabeling rate and running time. We highlight the advantages and disadvantages of these methods and provide recommendations of method choice depending on the available information. The challenges and future applications of these automatic methods are further discussed. In addition, we provide a free scRNA-seq data analysis package encompassing the discussed automatic methods to help the easy usage of them in real-world applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRNA 3abiotechnology 3aprediction 0aSingle-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) 0aAutomatic identification 0aCell type 0aEager learning 0aLazy learning 0aMarker learning1 aJiang, Qin1 aMora, Antonio1 aLi, Xuri0 tComputational and Structural Biotechnology Journal.g2021, v. 19 p.5874-5887dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23199x2001-03707nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.csbj.2021.10.0273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02172naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245005900169520098500228592002801213650001501241650001101256650001901267650001501286650002001301650001301321650001801334650001101352650001301363653001201376653001901388653002601407653002301433700001601456700001601472700002001488700001901508700002101527773010801548856008501656852000901741655001201750IND60735727420221122150759.0211003e202107  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073572742DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fuproc.2021.1068592doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhou, Chenyang10aCO2 capture intensified by solvents with metal hydride  aCarbon dioxide capture significantly helps achieve the carbon neutral goal. Chemical absorption of CO₂ by the solvent meets the bottleneck of the high energy consumption. An advanced solvent of CuH/PANI/TEMPO has been developed to reduce the energy consumption. The metal hydride CuH decomposes into the Cu atom to intensify the thermoelectric effect between PANI and TEMPO. The strong thermoelectric effect has the potential to enhance the CO₂ desorption. DFT model and mass and energy transfer model in the nano-scale are developed accurately to quantify the system of CO₂ and CuH/PANI/TEMPO. The CO₂ fraction, electron density and velocity in the nano-domain are studied. It is found that the symmetrical electron density zone is produced. The mass transfer coefficient is improved by 2.15 times with 4.65 × 10⁻⁶ m/s and the energy consumption is reduced to 1.02GJ/tCO₂. The thermoelectric conversion accounts for 31.4%–43.5% of the overall energy transfer.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3acarbon 3acarbon dioxide 3adesorption 3aenergy transfer 3ahydrides 3amass transfer 3amodels 3asolvents 0aSolvent 0aCarbon dioxide 0aThermoelectric effect 0aEnergy consumption1 aYu, Yunsong1 aZhang, Chen1 aZhang, Jingfeng1 aZhang, Zaoxiao1 aWang, Geoff G.X.0 tFuel processing technology.g2021 July, v. 218 p.106859-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12445x0378-38207nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fuproc.2021.1068593Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02738naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024005500094040001800149100002700167245009100194300001600285520173200301592002802033653002302061653001602084653001602100653001902116653002502135700002302160773014102183856011502324852000902439655001202448IND60128238820221118132758.0151115e200703  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012823882DNAL7 a10.3394/0380-1330(2007)33[279:SRMOAM]2.0.CO;22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMaruthi Sridhar, B. B.10aSpectral Reflectance Measurements of a Microcystis Bloom in Upper Klamath Lake, Oregon  ap. 279-284.  aThe objective of this study was to measure the in situ spectral reflectance of lake water that contains a bloom of Microcystis, a species of cyanobacteria. Reflectance spectra (350––2,500 nm) of lake water near a boat dock in Upper Klamath Lake, Oregon, were collected with a portable spectrora-diometer on a cloud-free day with sunlight as a source of illumination between 0845 to 0915 hours, Pacific Daylight Time (PDT) on 17 August 2004, at a near-normal angle of observation. The averaged spectrum of the lake water containing the Microcystis bloom exhibits reflectance maxima from 550––590 nm and near 710 nm wavelengths and reflectance minima near 630 nm and 675 nm wavelengths. The reflectance gradually decreases from 810––1,000 nm and has very low reflectance in the 1,000––2,500 nm wavelength region. Our results show that the spectral reflectance of Microcystis at this stage of its bloom remains low for wavelengths longer than 1,000 nm in the near-infrared region of the spectrum. These spectral results have implications in selecting the spectral ratios and refining the algorithms that will be used to estimate phycocyanin content using satellite models. Microcystis is the predominant species of cyanobacteria blooms in Lake Erie, which makes these spectral data as important to the Great Lakes as it is to Upper Klamath Lake. Satellite algorithms have been published that have mapped phycocyanin, a pigment more uniquely associated with cyanobacteria than is chlorophyll a, in Lake Erie with data from LANDSAT TM bands 1, 3, 4, 5, and 7, and the reflectance spectra reported here are the first that cover the entire spectral range of all those LANDSAT TM spectral bands for a Microcystis bloom.  aPublisher supplied data 0aUpper Klamath Lake 0aMicrocystis 0aphycocyanin 0aremote sensing 0aspectral reflectance1 aVincent, Robert K.0 tJournal of Great Lakes research.g2007 Mar., v. 33, no. 1 p.279-284dInternational Association for Great Lakes Researchx0380-13307nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3394%2F0380-1330%282007%2933%5B279%3ASRMOAM%5D2.0.CO%3B23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02666naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245006400168300001800232520152200250592002801772650000801800650001201808650002201820650001701842650001601859650001001875650001301885650001801898650000801916650001901924650001301943650001501956650002501971650001601996700002002012700003202032773010202064856008102166852000902247655001202256IND60440338520221121211047.0151024e201508  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6044033852DNAL7 a10.1007/s11947-015-1542-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJames, Christian12aA Review of Novel and Innovative Food Freezing Technologies  ap. 1616-1634.  aFreezing is a very well-established food preservation process that produces high quality nutritious foods with a long storage life. However, freezing is not suitable for all foods, and freezing can cause physical and chemical changes in some foods that are perceived as reducing the quality of either the thawed material or the final product. This paper reviews the many innovative freezing processes that are currently being researched and developed throughout the world to improve freezing conditions and product quality. Some innovative freezing processes (impingement and hydrofluidisation) are essentially improvements of existing methods (air blast and immersion, respectively) to produce far higher surface heat transfer rates than previous systems and thus improve product quality through rapid freezing. In these cases, the advantages may depend on the size of the product, since the poor thermal conductivity of many foods limits the rate of cooling in large objects rather than the heat transfer between the heat transfer medium and the product. Other processes (pressure shift, magnetic resonance, electrostatic, microwave, radiofrequency, and ultrasound) are adjuncts to existing freezing systems that aim to improve product quality through controlling the way that ice is formed in the food during freezing. Another alternative is to change the properties of the food itself to control how ice is formed during freezing (such as in dehydrofreezing and the use of antifreeze and ice-nucleation proteins).  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3acooling 3afood preservation 3afood quality 3afood safety 3afoods 3afreezing 3aheat transfer 3aice 3aice nucleation 3aproteins 3ashelf life 3athermal conductivity 3aultrasonics1 aPurnell, Graham1 aJames, S.

To determine the key period for the asynchronous differentiation of superior and inferior earshoots and how hormones are involved in this process, a two-year experiment was designed using two maize hybrids: Suyu 41 (S41, single-ear hybrid) and AN 101 (A101, double-ear hybrid). The results showed that the lag of lower earshoot differentiation was not only caused by the delay of the differentiation starting time but also related to extension of the duration in spikelet differentiation (stage II) and sexual organ formation stage (stage IV). From 12 days before silking (DBS), the contents of indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), zeatin riboside (ZR)+zeatin (ZT), and gibberellic acid (GA₃) in both upper and lower earshoots of the two hybrids increased dramatically and then decreased quickly. ABA slightly increased in the two hybrids and then decreased slowly in S41, while it was maintained at a high level in A101. At 8 DBS, i.e., the transition period from floret differentiation to sexual organ formation stage, not only the growth of upper-to-lower earshoot difference (ULED), but also the values for ULED of IAA, ZR+ZT and GA₃ were all significantly higher in S41 than in A101. Furthermore, the upper-to-lower hormone ratios IAAU//AAL and (ZR+ZT)U/(ZR+ZT)L were also much higher in the single-ear hybrid than in the double-ear hybrid, while the GA₃U/GA₃L and ABAU/ABAL had no significant differences. In addition, the time course of ULEDₕₒᵣₘₒₙₑ/ULEDₑₐᵣₛₕₒₒₜ gᵣₒwₜₕ ᵣₐₜₑ also suggested that the hormones work in different ways in earshoot superiority/inferiority formation. The delayed differentiation of lower ear shoots was conclusively related to the later initiation of differentiation and the longer durations of specific differentiation stages. Compared with the regulating roles of IAA and ZR+ZT in the key period (8 DBS) of superiority/inferiority differentiation, GA₃ seems to be affected earlier, while ABA contributes little to this process.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagriculture 3acorn 3aears 3aflorets 3agibberellic acid 3ahybrids 3aindole acetic acid 3aspikelets 3azeatin 0amaize (Zea mays L.) 0aearshoot 0aplant hormone 0asuperior/inferior differentiation1 aZHAO, Wen-qing1 aZHOU, Zhi-guo1 aSHAO, Jing-jing1 aHU, Wei1 aKONG, Ling-jie1 aWANG, You-hua0 tJournal of integrative agriculture.g2021 Dec., v. 20, no. 12 p.3143-3155dElsevier B.V.aCAAS.

The LOEM is developed under the framework of the EFDC model (Hamrick 1992). Lake Okeechobee is the largest subtropical lake in North America (1,730 km²), it is very shallow (mean depth 2.7 m), and it includes a littoral habitat that makes up 20%% of its area. The LOEM is calibrated, verified, and validated to 3 years of water quality and SAV data. The water quality results are consistent with observed data from 25 locations in the lake. The model is capable of reproducing key water quality characteristics of the lake without having to resort to extensive, site-specific parameter manipulations. The SAV model is calibrated using measured SAV data in the lake. The SAV model is capable of representing the spatial and temporal variations of SAV variations in the lake well. The LOEM is applied to study water quality and SAV processes in the lake. The model results are consistent with observed data indicating that algal growth in the lake is primarily nitrogen limited in the summer and nitrogen and light co-limited in the winter. Lower water elevation generally leads to larger SAV area. SAV can have positive impact on the lake water quality by reducing algae concentration. The calibrated, verified, and validated LOEM model serves as a useful tool to support lake management.  aPublisher supplied data 0aWater quality 0aeutrophication 0asubmerged aquatic vegetation (SAV) 0athree-dimensional modeling 0aLake Okeechobee1 aJi, Zhen-Gang1 aJames, R.

Recent pilot research indicates that benthic mats formed by the scarcely investigated fleshy red alga Phyllophora crispa also host a high diversity of benthic fauna. Among the key taxa found in these mats in the recent pilot studies are benthic foraminifera that live as epiphytes on the red algae thalli. Knowledge about their abundance and species richness associated with this habitat in relation to reference habitats is missing. We thus carried out a comparative assessment focusing on foraminifera within samples from P. crispa mats and neighboring P. oceanica meadows on five different sampling sites around Giglio Island in the Tuscan Archipelago (Tyrrhenian Sea, Italy). A total of 104 different foraminiferal taxa were identified, of which a total of 85 taxa were found in P. crispa samples (46 exclusively in this habitat). This biodiversity was higher compared to other studies on phytal habitats in the Mediterranean Sea. The number of foraminiferal taxa associated with P. crispa was significantly higher (average 27.5 ± 8.1 taxa) compared to P. oceanica (leaves average 7.0 ± 3.6, shoots average 7.9 ± 3.4 taxa). The abundance of foraminifera (12,000 individuals m⁻² surface area of P. crispa mat) was also higher than in the neighboring P. oceanica meadows (7792 individuals m⁻² leaf and 8171 individuals m⁻² shoot surface area). The most frequently found taxa across habitats were Miniacina miniacea, Lobatula lobatula, and Sejunctella sp. (24%, 20%, and 6% of the total population, respectively). Our results imply that P. crispa mats host an exceptional diversity of associated foraminifera that is even higher than those associated with seagrass meadows. Red algae mats built by P. crispa may thus be considered as potential refuge habitats and biodiversity reservoirs in management and conservation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPhyllophora 3aPosidonia oceanica 3aRetaria 3abenthic organisms 3aepiphytes 3aleaves 3aspecies richness 3asurface area 3athallus 3aItaly 3aMediterranean Sea 3aTyrrhenian Sea1 aMerk, Benedikt 1 aWild, Christian 0 tDiversity.g2021 Dec. 30, v. 14, no. 1dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21675x1424-28187nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/d140100213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03126naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024005400094040001800148100002700166245010400193300001400297520199000311592002802301653001202329653000902341653001902350653002102369653001402390653002002404653001502424653001602439700002502455700001602480700001802496773013902514856011402653852000902767655001202776IND60128239120221118132422.0151115e200703  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012823912DNAL7 a10.3394/0380-1330(2007)33[46:HNSILE]2.0.CO;22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHogan, LeAnn Southward10aHow Non-native Species in Lake Erie Influence Trophic Transfer of Mercury and Lead to Top Predators  ap. 46-61.  aLake Erie's food web has been dramatically modified by exotic species. Both exotic dreissenid mussels and the round goby Neogobius melanastomus have shifted the food web from a pelagic-based to a benthic-based one, potentially creating a new pathway for contaminant transfer to top predators. Before the invasion of round gobies, few predators of dreissenids occurred in Lake Erie, allowing contaminants to be confined to these benthic organisms. The invasion of the round goby has produced a new pathway through which these contaminants can enter the food web. To characterize heavy-metal transfer through this new food web and to assess risk to humans, water, surficial sediment, dreissenid, round goby, and smallmouth bass Micropterus dolomieui samples were collected at three sites during summers, 2002 and 2003, and analyzed for total lead (Pb), total mercury (Hg), and methyl mercury (MeHg). In addition, we compared smallmouth bass Pb and Hg concentrations to those measured in 1993/1994, before round gobies were prevalent. Pb biodiminished and MeHg biomagnified through the food web to smallmouth bass; patterns were similar among our three sites. Total Pb concentrations in smallmouth bass were higher before the incorporation of round gobies into their diet. We attributed this decline to changes in food web structure, changes in contaminant burdens in prey, or declines in sediment Pb concentrations in Lake Erie. By comparison, Hg concentrations in smallmouth bass changed little, before and after the round goby invasion, possibly due to a shift in diet that increased growth. Despite a decline in sediment Hg concentrations in Lake Erie, smallmouth bass continued to accumulate Hg at historical rates possibly because of their high consumption rates of benthivorous round gobies. As smallmouth bass continue to consume round gobies during their lives, their Hg concentrations may well continue to increase, potentially increasing the risk of Hg contamination to humans.  aPublisher supplied data 0aMercury 0alead 0amethyl mercury 0atrophic transfer 0aLake Erie 0asmallmouth bass 0around goby 0adreissenids1 aMarschall, Elizabeth1 aFolt, Carol1 aStein, Roy A.0 tJournal of Great Lakes research.g2007 Mar., v. 33, no. 1 p.46-61dInternational Association for Great Lakes Researchx0380-13307nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3394%2F0380-1330%282007%2933%5B46%3AHNSILE%5D2.0.CO%3B23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02953naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001300151245014700164520167800311592002801989650001602017650000902033650002902042650002502071650001102096650001902107650001502126651001002141653002302151653003302174653001702207653000802224653002502232653002102257700001602278700001902294700001702313773011802330856008602448852000902534655001202543IND60714954620221119230609.0210506e20210101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071495462DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jenvman.2020.1112892doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHou, Wei10aRestoration priority assessment of coal mining brownfields from the perspective of enhancing the connectivity of green infrastructure networks  aIntegration of mining brownfields into green infrastructure(GI) planning has been widely recognized as a sustainable developmentstrategy. The key is to locate the spatial priority areas for brownfieldrestoration that would provide the greatest enhancement of themultifunctionality of the GI network. At the regional scale, a wellconnectedGI network can help maximize the benefits that it generates andachieve greater multifunctionality. In this paper, an approach forassessing the restoration priority of brownfields is proposed from the perspective of enhancing the structural connectivity of GI network. Itcan also be used as an assistance tool for planning GI networks at theregional level. The Least Cost Path (LCP) model is adopted for mapping corridors among GI patches on the basis of a resistance map composed by considering the naturalness of land covers, the riparian corridor, and disturbance of roads. Taking Fenhe River Basin (in China) as an example, three factors are jointly considered in the priority assessment of brownfields restoration: their potential contribution as corridors, their importance as stepping stones, and their resistance values. Then, we divided the brownfields into groups indicating the level of priority for restoration. The results show that 67% of the brownfields are of high or very high priority for restoration (mainly located in the north), and less than 10% area is recognized as very low or low priority. Our proposed approach could be a valuable tool for providing a macro-scale assessment of restoration priorities of brownfields for enhancing the GI network connectivity, and giving instructions for on-site redevelopment.  aPublisher supplied data 3abrownfields 3acoal 3aenvironmental management 3agreen infrastructure 3amodels 3ariparian areas 3awatersheds 3aChina 0aMining brownfields 0aGreen infrastructure network 0aConnectivity 0aGIS 0aRestoration priority 0aLeast-cost model1 aZhai, Liang1 aFeng, Shanshan1 aWalz, Ulrich0 tJournal of environmental management.g2021 Jan. 01, v. 277 p.111289-dElsevier LtdwJournal:2018x0301-47977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2020.1112893Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02519naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002700147245013000174300001600304520144900320592002801769650001901797650001701816650001101833650001301844650001101857650002301868650001501891650001601906650001301922650002401935651001001959700001901969773011201988856004802100852000902148655001202157IND50089604520221120054434.0140514e201406  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5008960452DNAL7 a10.1007/s10344-014-0813-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMartínez-Jauregui, M.12aA note on the effectiveness of incorporating management objectives with ecological variables when modeling red deer abundance  ap. 511-517.  aBig game populations are being raised in areas characterized by different land uses and are being managed under a wide range of circumstances which might influence their population densities and structure. However, the consideration of explanatory variables related to management activities is not generally explicitly considered in game population models. This paper focuses on how estate owners’ management objectives and strategies influence red deer (Cervus elaphus L.) hunting yields. We study red deer harvest in 187 hunting estates in Andalusia (Spain) and use both ecological and management predictors to describe capture levels in each hunting estate. We have found that the main land use of the area where red deer are being raised, the type of hunting holder, and the long-term management strategies (such as fencing and the hunting practices implemented) significantly explain red deer hunting bag, which is often used as proxy of population abundance. Therefore, ecological variables alone are not always sufficient to determine big game harvests. We provide empirical support that reinforces the relevance of considering humans and their long-term decisions when trying to interpret wildlife harvests, populations, and trends. We urge scientists and technicians to incorporate human aims in the game species distribution models and resource user decision models, particularly when game populations are being intensively managed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCervus elaphus 3abiogeography 3ahumans 3aland use 3amodels 3apopulation density 3ascientists 3atechnicians 3awildlife 3awildlife management 3aSpain1 aHerruzo, A.

We quantified the effect of four temperature ranges (2––3, 4––5, 7––8, and 10––12°°C) on consumption of lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush) and rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) eggs by a native (Orconectes propinquus) and an exotic (Orconectes rusticus) crayfish found in the Great Lakes. Mean individual consumption ranged from 0.1 to 1.5 lake trout eggs per day and from 1.0 to 5.5 rainbow trout eggs per day, respectively. Temperature influenced consumption for O. rusticus feeding on rainbow trout eggs but not O. propinquus. The effect of conspecific predator competition on rainbow trout egg consumption was evaluated using three densities of crayfish (1, 5, 10 per tank). For O. rusticus, mean individual consumption rate was higher at the lowest crayfish density (1 crayfish/tank) than at medium (5 crayfish/tank) or high (10 crayfish/tank) densities. A similar conspecific effect was not evident in O. propinquus and total consumption per unit area increased with crayfish density. The effect of competition among crayfish species on consumption of rainbow trout eggs was examined by comparing feeding rates at high crayfish abundance levels in single and mixed species treatments.

The post-peak behavior observed from existing experiments is critical for the determination of the complete constitutive relation of quasi-brittle rocks. Based on the test observation on the post-peak immobile residual strength of quasi-brittle rock specimens, a proper damage tolerance is defined in this study. Following this theme, a damage tolerance principle is presented by adopting an alternative methodology, which incorporates a loading function to represent the reaction to the stress state and a condition of damage tolerance based on the Mohr–Coulomb criterion without cohesive strength. Then, an iterative solution is proposed to identify the parameters of the proposed model. The identified constitutive law is employed to determine the load–deformation behavior of quasi-brittle rocks including sandstone and quartzite, and the calculated results are compared with the test results under different confinement stress levels. Results show that the developed constitutive law for quasi-brittle rocks with damage tolerance principle can be used to predict the post-peak behavior including the strain-softening behavior and the immobile residual strength with acceptable accuracy. Finally, a parametric study is conducted to essentially investigate the effect of parameters of the proposed model on the observed characteristics of quasi-brittle rocks.  aPublisher supplied data 3amechanical stress 3amodels 3aquartz 3asandstone 3astrength (mechanics)1 aZhang, Chao1 aCao, Wen-gui1 aZhao, Ming-hua0 tEnvironmental earth sciences.g2016 May, v. 75, no. 10 p.862-862dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx1866-62807nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12665-016-5681-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03728naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002100151245018500172300001600357520170800373536014002081592002802221596009302249650002002342650002102362650002802383650001702411650001602428650001502444650001002459650002302469650001902492650001602511650001602527650002902543650002502572650001502597650001902612650001502631650001202646650003902658650003002697650003002727653002402757653002302781653002802804653001502832653002502847700002602872700001702898700002702915773011402942856008503056852000903141655001203150IND60634493720221117225258.0190323e20190403xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063449372DNAL7 a10.1080/08905436.2019.15708532doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aÖzturk, Mehmet,10aConstruction of R16F and D19L mutations in the loop I of bile salt hydrolase (BSH) enzyme from Lactobacillus plantarum B14 and structural and functional analysis of the mutant BSHs  ap. 125-141.  aBile salt hydrolase (BSH), found commonly in intestinal species of Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium, catalyzes the hydrolysis of glycine or taurine-conjugated bile acids into the amino acids and free bile acids. Deconjugated bile acids potentially play an important role in the reduction of blood cholesterol level and formation of some gastrointestinal diseases such as cholestasis, gallstone formation, and colon cancer. Although the crystal and three-dimensional structures of BSH enzyme are known, the working mechanism of catalytic activity of such an important BSH enzyme is not known very well. Previous in silico analysis of multiple BSH has identified that Arginine-16 (R16) and Aspartate-19 (D19) were catalytically important residues in the active site of BSH. To confirm the function of these amino acids, in this study, BSH enzyme from Lactobacillus plantarum B14 strain was cloned into Escherichia coli and strictly conserved polar R16 and D19 amino acids of BSH enzyme were substituted for hydrophobic Phenylalanine-16 (F16) and Leucine-19 (L19) amino acids, respectively, by polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based site-directed mutagenesis. The effects of the mutations on catalytic activity and structure of the BSH enzymes were detected by ninhidrin assay and sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) analysis, respectively. Research results showed that although F16 mutation led to loss of enzyme activity completely, L19 mutation led to abolishment of the synthesis of BSH enzyme. These results indicated that R16 and D19 amino acids located in loop I of the BSH enzyme might be critical for catalytic activity and assembly of the BSH enzyme respectively.  aThis work was supported by funds from The Scientific Technological Research Council of Turkey (TUBITAK) by grant TBAG-113Z130 (to MÖ).  aPublisher supplied data  aTBAG-113Z130 (to MÖ)cThe Scientific Technological Research Council of Turkey (TUBITAK) 3aBifidobacterium 3aEscherichia coli 3aLactobacillus plantarum 3aactive sites 3aamino acids 3abile acids 3ablood 3acatalytic activity 3acholelithiasis 3acholestasis 3acholesterol 3acholoylglycine hydrolase 3acolorectal neoplasms 3ahydrolysis 3ahydrophobicity 3aintestines 3amutants 3apolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis 3apolymerase chain reaction 3asite-directed mutagenesis 0aBile salt hydrolase 0acatalytic activity 0aLactobacillus plantarum 0aprobiotics 0asubstrate preference1 aHacıbeyoğlu, Kübra1 aÖnal, Cansu1 aKılıçsaymaz, Zekiye0 tFood biotechnology.g2019 Apr. 3, v. 33, no. 2 p.125-141dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl46326x1532-42497nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/08905436.2019.15708533Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03188naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100002400154245011100178300001600289520185400305592002802159650002202187650001702209650002202226650001502248650001602263650001202279650001502291650001202306650002202318650002502340651001102365653003102376653002502407653002402432653002002456653001702476700003402493700003402527773009502561856008902656852000902745655001202754IND60629746720221121003534.0190328e201904  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062974672DNAL7 a10.1016/j.landusepol.2019.01.0332doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFoscaches, Caroline10aDoes social identity matter in governance decisions? Evidence from an agrarian reform settlement in Brazil  ap. 215-226.  aTo what extent can Social Identity (or the sense of belonging to a group) induce one of the transacting parties to sell his product by using the governance structure endorsed by the group to which he/she belongs (even if that decision contradicts the efficient alignment principle outlined by Transaction Cost Economics - TCE)? To this end, we incorporate the idea underlying the microfoundations of strategy into TCE. First, we revise the motivation driving economic behavior in vertical trading transactions by incorporating Social Identity into the utility function of one of the transacting parties. This implies that he/she would also wish to maximize his/her acceptance by the group to which he/she belongs. Second, we explore the conditions in which social identities matter most to the governance decision, as well as their respective effect on the governance choice: will the discriminating alignment hold or will other decisions prevail? Empirically, we conducted a survey together with 109 rural producers in one of the oldest agrarian reform settlements to be supported by the Social Movement MST in Brazil. We sought to see how they sold their produce (market relationships, vertical integration or cooperatives — the arrangement endorsed by MST). Our choice was motivated mainly by the identification of these producers with MST. The results indicate a positive and significant relation between Social Identity and the use of the governance mechanism encouraged by the group to which the agent belongs (in our case, MST). This effect is stronger than is that of transactional attributes when said social identities are strong. This implies that the efficient alignment might not hold when social identities are very high, because the motivations driving economic relations can be more complex than are transactional attributes alone.  aPublisher supplied data 3acollective action 3acooperatives 3aeconomic behavior 3agovernance 3aland reform 3amarkets 3amotivation 3asurveys 3autility functions 3avertical integration 3aBrazil 0aTransaction cost economics 0aGovernance structure 0aVertical strategies 0aSocial identity 0aSocial group1 aSaes, Maria Sylvia Macchione,1 aBigio Schnaider, Paula Sarita0 tLand use policy.g2019 Apr., v. 83 p.215-226dElsevier LtdwJournal:12412x0264-83777nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.landusepol.2019.01.0333Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02692naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002900147245012500176300001800301520130700319592002801626650001801654650001001672650001401682650001101696650001501707650001901722650002501741650002301766650000901789650002201798650001101820650001501831650001401846650001601860650003401876650003301910650001101943650001501954700002201969700002101991700001802012773010202030856008102132852000902213655001202222IND60440339120221121223112.0151024e201508  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6044033912DNAL7 a10.1007/s11947-015-1534-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSalazar-López, Erika I.10aIncorporation of Microcapsules in Pineapple Intercellular Tissue Using Osmotic Dehydration and Microencapsulation Method  ap. 1699-1706.  aThe objective of this study was to analyze the simultaneous application of microencapsulation (ME) and osmotic dehydration (OD) in the development of an innovative process to incorporate microcapsules into the intercellular spaces of pineapple tissue. Osmo-dehydrated pineapple impregnated with microcapsules (OPIM) was obtained when fresh pineapple rings were osmo-dehydrated in emulsions (600 g solids kg⁻¹ emulsion) prepared with 40 % water, 45 % sugar, 12 % gum Arabic, and 3 % piquin pepper oleoresin (EP). Emulsion EP produced OPIM rings with 8 g oil kg⁻¹ fruit. The β-carotene content of OPIM samples increased 28 % in relation to fresh fruit. In addition, OPIM rings showed an acceptable color and rehydration capacity. They were also evaluated for organoleptic acceptability, finding out that rehydrated OPIM samples did not present significant difference (p < 0.05) with regard to fresh fruit on a nine-point Hedonic scale. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) images revealed the presence of microcapsules of 1–5 μm into OPIM tissue. Based on these results, this technique can also be implemented in other fruit and vegetables. Its versatility opens a new method to design healthy products combining flavors and functional substances in an intelligent and creative way.  aPublisher supplied data 3abeta-carotene 3acolor 3aemulsions 3aflavor 3agum arabic 3ahedonic scales 3aintercellular spaces 3amicroencapsulation 3aoils 3aosmotic treatment 3apepper 3apineapples 3araw fruit 3arehydration 3ascanning electron microscopes 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asugars 3avegetables1 aJiménez, Maribel1 aSalazar, Ricardo1 aAzuara, Ebner0 tFood and bioprocess technology.g2015 Aug., v. 8, no. 8 p.1699-1706dSpringer USx1935-51307nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11947-015-1534-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03110naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002500149245014000174300001600314520130100330592002801631650002001659650002701679650002201706650001801728650002401746650002001770650001001790650002501800650002801825650002201853650001501875650001601890650003101906650001701937650001001954650001401964650002301978650000802001651001002009653001302019653001502032653001502047653001002062653001602072700001802088700001702106700002102123700002002144700002102164700001802185773023602203856008402439852000902523655001202532IND60543650320221119152555.0190411e201509  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054365032DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aspen.2015.07.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChandrashekara, K.N.10aDNA barcoding reveals host associated genetic diversity of ‘tea mosquito bug’ Helopeltis theivora (Miridae: Heteroptera) from India  ap. 541-545.  aThe tea mosquito bug, Helopeltis theivora Waterhouse (Miridae: Heteroptera) is a polyphagous pest that affects a number of economically important crops in India. Partial sequences of mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase 1 (mtCOI) were used to study host associated genetic variation on H. theivora collected from tea (Camellia sinensis L.), cashew (Anacardium occidentale L.), acalypha (Acalypha indica L.) and cocoa (Theobroma cacao L.). The results suggest that host plants have a significant effect on the genetic variation of bugs collected from two wide geographical locations (South India and North-East India). Haplotyping data analysis of mtCOI reveals six host plant specific haplotypes of H. theivora with minimum genetic divergence (0.8%) between two haplotypes within tea as compared to other plants (2.6–11.1%). Further phylogenetic (NJ, ML and BA) analysis evidence three host specific distinct clades. The most surprising result that emerged from our studies is the harmony between clustering of H. theivora and host plant phylogeny. The results indicate that host plants do have selection pressure and substantial effect on genetic variation in H. theivora and such adaptive evolution may have repercussions for IPM (Integrated Pest Management) strategies of H. theivora in India.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAcalypha indica 3aAnacardium occidentale 3aCamellia sinensis 3aDNA barcoding 3aHelopeltis theivora 3aTheobroma cacao 3acrops 3acytochrome-c oxidase 3aevolutionary adaptation 3agenetic variation 3ahaplotypes 3ahost plants 3aintegrated pest management 3amitochondria 3apests 3aphylogeny 3aselection pressure 3atea 3aIndia 0aTea pest 0aHost plant 0aPolyphagia 0amtCOI 0aHaplotyping1 aKumar, R.

Adventitious cultures were induced from the roots of in vitro grown plantlets on Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium containing combination of gibberellic acid (GA₃; 0.5, 1.0, 1.5 and 2.0 mg/L) and naphthalene acetic acid (NAA; 0.5 mg/L). Initially, a known mass of inoculum roots were shifted into suspension media augmented with various GA₃ concentrations. The growth behavior of adventitious roots was recorded every 3 days for a period of 30 days. Maximum biomass biosynthesis (13.12 g/flask) was noticed in exponential phase on 27th day in the suspension containing 2.0 mg/L of GA₃. Other GA₃ concentrations also displayed optimum patterns of biomass accumulation as compared to the control. Adventitious roots were investigated for total phenolic content (TPC) and production (TPP), total flavonoid content (TFC) and production (TFP), and 1, 1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH)-based antioxidant potential. Maximum phenolics (TPC 9.84 mg gallic acid equivalent (GAE)/g-dry weight (DW)) and TPP (147.6 mg/L), TFC (5.12 mg Quercitin equivalent (QE)/g-DW) and TFP (76.91 mg/L) were observed in 2.0 mg/L GA₃ treated cultures. The same concentration of gibberellic acid enhanced antioxidant activity (77.2%). Furthermore, maximum stevioside (7.13 mg/g-DW), rebaudioside-A (0.27 mg/g-DW) and dulcoside-A (0.001 mg/g-DW) were observed in roots exposed to 2.0 mg/L GA₃. This is the first report on the application of GA₃ on biomass accumulation and secondary metabolite production in S. rebaudiana. The current study will be helpful to scale up the adventitious root cultures in bioreactors for the production of biomass and pharmaceutically important secondary metabolites.  aPublisher supplied data 3a2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl 3aStevia rebaudiana 3aadventitious roots 3aantioxidant activity 3abiomass production 3abioreactors 3abiosynthesis 3aflavonoids 3agallic acid 3agibberellic acid 3aglycosides 3ainoculum 3anaphthaleneacetic acid 3aplantlets 3apolyphenols 3asecondary metabolites 3asteviol 3astevioside1 aAli, Haider 1 aKhan, Habiba 1 aBegam, Almas 1 aKhan, Sheraz 1 aAli, Syed  Shujait1 aAhmad, Naveed 1 aFazal, Hina 1 aAli, Mohammad 1 aHano, Christophe 1 aAhmad, Nisar 1 aAbbasi, Bilal  Haider0 tPlants.g2020 Mar. 30, v. 9, no. 4dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21620x2223-77477nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/plants90404203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03655naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245011800170300001800288520195600306592002802262650001602290650002502306650002802331650001302359650002802372650002002400650002402420650002902444650001102473650002202484650002102506650002302527650000702550650001402557650001502571650002002586650001902606650002402625650001802649650001702667650001102684651001002695653001902705653001902724700001902743700001402762700001702776700001302793700002002806773016802826856008602994852000903080655001203089IND60754694220221120125847.0211206e202112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075469422DNAL7 a10.1016/S2095-3119(20)63446-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZHAO, Yong-gan10aFertility and biochemical activity in sodic soils 17 years after reclamation with flue gas desulfurization gypsum  ap. 3312-3322.  aPrevious studies have mainly focused on changes in soil physical and chemical properties to evaluate the reclamation of sodic soils using flue gas desulfurization (FGD) gypsum. However, information on the effects of this reclamation method on microbial-based indicators of soil quality is limited, particularly after many years of FGD gypsum application. This study aimed to investigate the long-term effects of FGD gypsum on soil organic carbon (SOC), nutrients, microbial biomass and enzyme activity. Data were collected from soils of three exchangeable sodium percentage (ESP) classes (i.e., low-, middle- and high-ESP classes of 6.1–20, 20–30 and 30–78.4%, respectively) 17 years after FGD gypsum treatment in Inner Mongolia, China. Averaged across the three ESP classes, FGD gypsum application increased the SOC contents at the 0–20 and 20–40-cm soil depths by 18 and 35%, respectively, and increased available potassium at the 0–20-cm soil depth by 51% compared with the no-gypsum controls. The microbial biomass carbon and microbial biomass nitrogen contents at the 20–40-cm soil depth increased by 69 and 194%, respectively, under FGD gypsum. Except in the high-ESP class, urease activities in the 0–40 cm soil profile were significantly higher in the FGD gypsum treatments than in the controls. A significant increase in alkaline phosphatase activity was concentrated in the 20–40 cm soil layer; few classes showed significant increases in catalase and invertase activities in the 0–20 cm soil layer. Pearson correlation analysis showed that increases in soil fertility and biological activity could be attributed to reductions in electrical conductivity, pH and ESP caused by FGD gypsum application. These results confirm that FGD gypsum application is a viable strategy for reclaiming sodic soils due to its positive effects on soil fertility and biochemistry and that it may contribute to soil ecosystem sustainability.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagriculture 3aalkaline phosphatase 3abeta-fructofuranosidase 3acatalase 3aelectrical conductivity 3aenzyme activity 3aexchangeable sodium 3aflue gas desulfurization 3agypsum 3amicrobial biomass 3amicrobial carbon 3amicrobial nitrogen 3apH 3apotassium 3asoil depth 3asoil ecosystems 3asoil fertility 3asoil organic carbon 3asoil profiles 3asoil quality 3aurease 3aChina 0aorganic carbon 0anutrient pools1 aWANG, Shu-juan1 aLiu, Jia,1 aZHUO, Yu-qun1 aLi, Yan,1 aZHANG, Wen-chao0 tJournal of integrative agriculture.g2021 Dec., v. 20, no. 12 p.3312-3322dElsevier B.V.aCAAS.

These amphiphilic polymers were able to self-assemble into cationic nanoparticles in aqueous solution at low concentrations. The nanoparticle formation was evidenced via cryo-transmission electron microscope (Cryo-TEM) and dynamic light scattering analysis. The average hydrodynamic size of rPAA-Ch blank nanoparticles was about 80–160 nm with zeta potential of 50–60 mV. Also, the effects of different percentages of cholesterol grafted onto rPAA on physicochemical characteristics, in vitro cytotoxicity, cellular uptake, VEGF gene silencing efficacy and translocation mechanism of rPAA-Ch/siRNA complexes were investigated. The results showed that rPAA-Ch57 polymer was not only able to form stable nanocomplexes and possess high cell uptake, but also to exhibit the best in vitro VEGF gene silencing efficacy and the best in vivo tumor growth inhibition effect when it was formulated with VEGF-siRNA. Moreover, the observations of confocal laser scanning microscope (CLSM) and the study of cholesterol competitive inhibition demonstrated that endosomal/lysosomal escape and cytoplasmic dissociation of rPAA-Ch57/siRNA complexes were dependent on the “proton sponge effect” and disulfide cleavage, following internalization with cholesterol-related endocytosis pathway and subsequent transportion into endosomes/lysosomes. These findings indicated that the rPAA-Ch57 polymer should be a promising and potent carrier for siRNA delivery.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaqueous solutions 3acholesterol 3aconfocal laser scanning microscopy 3acytotoxicity 3adissociation 3aendocytosis 3aendosomes 3agene silencing 3agrowth retardation 3ahydrodynamics 3alight scattering 3alysosomes 3ananoparticles 3aphysicochemical properties 3apolymers 3asmall interfering RNA 3avascular endothelial growth factors 3azeta potential1 aWang, Jian-Cheng1 aZhao, En-Yu1 aGao, Ling-Yan1 aFeng, Qiang1 aLiu, Xiao-Yan1 aZhao, Zhi-Xia1 aMa, Xiao-Fei1 aHou, Wen-Jie1 aZhang, Liang-Ren1 aLu, Wan-Liang1 aZhang, Qiang0 tBiomaterials.g2013 July, v. 34, no. 21 p.5303-5316dElsevier Ltdx0142-96127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biomaterials.2013.03.0563Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03028naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002700145245019100172300001600363500001500379520140300394592002801797650002201825650001601847650001801863650002201881650002901903650001501932650001601947650002701963650002201990650002402012650001702036650002802053650001802081650001502099650001402114650002302128650002002151653000902171653002202180700001702202700002802219700002102247700002402268700002202292700002302314773010402337856004802441852000902489655001202498IND4463746920221118170858.0120727e201202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446374692DNAL7 a10.1007/s11947-010-0380-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOberoi, Harinder Singh10aEnhanced Oil Recovery by Pre-treatment of Mustard Seeds Using Crude Enzyme Extract Obtained from Mixed-Culture Solid-State Fermentation of Kinnow (Citrus reticulata) Waste and Wheat Bran  ap. 759-767.  a2019-12-06  aSolid-state fermentation (SSF) of kinnow (Citrus reticulata) waste supplemented with wheat bran was used for production of cellulase, protease and pectinase with individual and mixed cultures of Trichoderma reesei and Aspergillus niger. Mustard seeds were pre-treated with crude filtrate extract (CFE) obtained from A. niger and T. reesei independently, and combination of the two cultures, prior to solvent extraction. Mixed-culture fermentation resulted in higher enzyme activity for filter paper cellulase (FPU), carboxymethyl cellulase (CMCase), β-glucosidase, and exoploygalacturonase (exo-PG) in comparison to fermentation with individual cultures. This study indicated that pre-treatment using crude enzyme obtained with mixed cultures enhanced the oil recovery by 11% as compared to control where no enzyme was used. Mustard seeds pre-treated with CFE obtained from mixed cultures having ratio of 2:1:1 for exo-polygalacturonase, FPU, and protease resulted in highest oil recovery. About 7–10% more oil was recovered when mustard seeds were pre-treated with CFE obtained from individual cultures, compared with control. Enzymatic pre-treatment also improved some of the quality attributes of mustard oil. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study where mixed-culture SSF was attempted to produce enzyme consortium for pre-treatment of mustard seeds for enhanced oil recovery.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCitrus reticulata 3amustard oil 3aseed extracts 3aAspergillus niger 3asolid state fermentation 3awheat bran 3aproteinases 3afood processing wastes 3apolygalacturonase 3aenzymatic treatment 3amustard seed 3aendo-1,4-beta-glucanase 3amixed culture 3aextraction 3afiltrates 3aTrichoderma reesei 3aenzyme activity 0aoils 0aHypocrea jecorina1 aBabbar, Neha1 aDhaliwal, Sandeep Singh1 aKaur, Simranjeet1 aVadlani, Praveen V.1 aBhargav, Vinod K.1 aPatil, Ramabhau T.0 tFood and bioprocess technology.g2012 Feb., v. 5, no. 2 p.759-767dSpringer-Verlagx1935-51307nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11947-010-0380-y  aDNAL 7aarticle02316naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002100139245007500160300001600235500001900251500002000270520095000290592002801240596005901268596012201327650001601449650002001465650002401485650001101509650002901520650001501549700005301564700005601617700005401673773013301727856007301860852000901933655001201942IND60722283620221121230957.0201230e202012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072228362DNAL7 a10.1111/wej.125292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Shengtang10aEffect of flexible vegetation lodging on overland run‐off resistance  ap. 333-341.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aVegetation is an important factor in overland run‐off. Due to its flexibility, the vegetation will often become lodged, which will change the characteristics of the flow. However, current studies of flow resistance from flexible vegetation are primarily limited to qualitative analyses. To study the quantitative relationship between the resistance coefficient λ and the vegetation lodging angle θ, an indoor simulation experiment was carried out. The results showed that λ gradually decreased with increasing θ under the same water depth. When the vegetation was unsubmerged, λᵤ increased as the depth of water increased under the same value of θ, while with completely submerged vegetation, λₛ decreased with increasing water depth. In addition, quantitative formulas for the relationship between the lodging angle and the resistance coefficient were obtained via regression analysis for both submerged and unsubmerged vegetation.  aPublisher supplied data  a41471025cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  aSDKDYC180320cPostgraduate Science and Technology Innovation Project of Shandong University of Science and Technology 3aenvironment 3aflow resistance 3aregression analysis 3arunoff 3asubmerged aquatic plants 3avegetation1 aLiu, Ying1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6435-03821 aWang, Zhikai1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2717-19991 aLi, Guibao1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4556-52000 tWater and environment journal.g2020 Dec., v. 34 Suppl S1 p.333-341dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3949847x1747-65857nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/wej.125293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03536naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024005500094040001800149100002400167245015900191300001600350520242700366592002802793653001002821653001102831653001402842653001302856653001802869653002002887700002402907700002502931700001902956773012002975856010603095852000903201655001203210IND60131239420221119003017.0180907e200709  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013123942DNAL7 a10.1672/0277-5212(2007)27[656:DTVDAA]2.0.CO;22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTouchette, Brant W.10aDrought tolerance versus drought avoidance: a comparison of plant-water relations in herbaceous wetland plants subjected to water withdrawal and repletion  ap. 656-667.  aWetlands are the intermediate between terrestrial and open water systems, and are thus fundamentally tied to changes in water table. Under normal climate conditions, wetlands may experience short periods of water scarcity through seasonal variations in precipitation or surface water run-off. However, during anomalous drought episodes, wetland plants may experience elevated water stress resulting in considerable decreases of both productivity and survival. Despite the intricate relationship between wetland macrophytes and water supply, little is known about the physiological responses of these plants to short-term water deficits. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of simulated drought on plant water relations in five herbaceous wetland species (monocots Carex alata, Juncus effusus, Peltandra virginica, and dicots Saururus cernuus, Justicia americana). In general, plant response to water deprivation may include drought avoidance (e.g., changes in stomatal conductance, leaf area, and leaf orientation) and/or drought tolerance (maintaining cell turgor through osmotic adjustments or cell wall elasticity). In this study, simulated drought resulted in significant decreases in xylem water potential (ΨΨₓyₗₑₘ) for all five species, suggesting that these plants were physiologically affected by water deficit. Four of the five species showed outward signs of drought avoidance, including significant reductions in transpiration (C. alata, P. virginica, J. americana, and S. cernuus) and decreases in leaf area (P. virginica and J. americana). Interestingly, while adjustments in transpiration were observed for most plants during the dry period, no significant changes in water use efficiencies (WUE) were detected until after water repletion. Notably, two species (C. alata and P. virginica) had enhanced WUE as water availability returned to pre-drought conditions. Water deficits also promoted drought tolerance responses in all five species, as indicated by a change in bulk modulus of elasticity (; all species) and decreased osmotic potential (ΨΨππ; P. virginica). Taken as a whole, this study reveals two contrasting drought tolerance strategies in wetland herbs. While four of the species alter to generate declines in ΨΨ, P. virginica favored decreases in osmotic potential (as indicated by decreases in ΨΨππ at full saturation and at turgor loss point).  aPublisher supplied data 0aCarex 0aJuncus 0aPeltandra 0aSaururus 0atranspiration 0awater potential1 aIannacone, Laura R.1 aTurner, Gwendolyn E.1 aFrank, Adam R.0 tWetlands.g2007 Sept., v. 27, no. 3 p.656-667dThe Society of Wetland ScientistswJournal:jnl57834x0277-52127nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1672/0277-5212(2007)27%5B656:DTVDAA%5D2.0.CO;23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01838naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100002700166245014000193300001600333500001500349520061500364592002800979650001401007650001601021650002101037650002401058650001201082650001901094650002601113653001201139700001701151700002101168700002201189700002201211700002201233773009501255856008101350852000901431655001201440IND60119998420221118220335.0150325e201502  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011999842DNAL7 a252980762pmid7 a10.1007/s00284-014-0709-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPowell, Christopher M.10aBacterial Community Composition of Three Candidate Insect Vectors of Palm Phytoplasma (Texas Phoenix Palm Decline and Lethal Yellowing)  ap. 240-245.  a2019-12-04  aTexas Phoenix Palm Decline (TPPD) and Lethal Yellowing are two phytoplasma-linked diseases in palms.

Izmir Tube Tunnel Project Proposal Under Scrutiny  aBuilding underwater tube tunnel crossings to ease the urban congestion problems has become a popular approach for many cities across the globe. London, New York, Istanbul, Hamburg, Sydney and Brisbane are among these cities. However, the effectiveness and externalities of these expensive mega urban infrastructures have also been questioned widely among urban, transport and environmental planning scholars. Given the international popularity of the topic, this study places a new tube tunnel crossings project from Izmir, Turkey under the microscope. In this heuristic simulation study, policy-on scenarios were tested to determine possible impacts of the underwater tube tunnel-crossing project. The traffic impacts are discussed using simulations assigning the initial origin&ndash;destination data. The results of the study revealed that, given the two locations, outer and inner locations over the dagger-shape bay, the capacity increments on the bridge links and the links around the periphery highway did not bring any effective solutions beyond some minor improvements. The findings disclosed that the ineffectiveness of the tube tunnel crossing might be due to the excessive congestion happening all over the downtown area, which clogs the passageways to the bridge. The paper highlights the limitations of the tube tunnel-crossing project, emphasises the need for comprehensive investigations before committing to the project and advocates the emphasis to be actually given for sustainable mobility.  aPublisher supplied data 3acities 3ainfrastructure 3aplanning 3atraffic 3aNew York 3aTurkey (country)1 aYigitcanlar, Tan 0 tSustainability.g2019 May 01, v. 11, no. 9dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2270x2071-10507nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su110925433Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02830naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024005500094040001800149100002300167245010400190300001600294520166400310592002801974653001502002653001402017653002702031653001902058653002002077653002402097653001202121653001802133700001902151700002302170700002202193773014102215856011502356852000902471655001202480IND60128239720221118132429.0151115e200706  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012823972DNAL7 a10.3394/0380-1330(2007)33[303:DORGIC]2.0.CO;22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCooper, Matthew J.10aDistribution of Round Gobies in Coastal Areas of Lake Michigan: Are Wetlands Resistant to Invasion?  ap. 303-313.  aGreat Lakes coastal wetlands may be more resistant to invasion by certain nonindigenous species and thus serve as refuge habitats for native species. As a first step in testing this hypothesis, we investigated the distribution of round goby (Apollonia melanostomus, formerly Neogobius melanostomus) in the lower reaches of several Lake Michigan tributary systems that contain both wet-land and lake habitats near their confluences with Lake Michigan. Using fyke nets, we sampled round gobies in lake and adjacent wetland habitats in four systems in 2004 and six systems in 2005. In each macrohabitat (lake or wetland), we sampled three microhabitats (mono-dominant stands of Nuphar, beds of submersed aquatic vegetation, and bare sediment). We found that round goby catch was generally lower in wetland macrohabitats than adjacent lake macrohabitats and that round gobies appeared to prefer beds of submersed aquatic vegetation in lakes among the three microhabitats. The majority of round gobies in all habitats were relatively small (< 7 cm standard length). We also found a significant negative correlation between round goby catch and distance of sampling points from the Lake Michigan shoreline in 2005, suggesting that 1) Lake Michigan nearshore waters (including the connecting navigation channels and pier areas) may be serving as round goby spawning and nursery habitats with subsequent dispersal into the tributary lake/wetland complexes, and 2) round gobies may still be invading these systems from Lake Michigan. Our results provide evidence that coastal wetland habitats are more resistant to invasion by round gobies than adjacent lake habitats.  aPublisher supplied data 0aRound goby 0aApollonia 0aNeogobius melanostomus 0aexotic species 0acoastal wetland 0adrowned river mouth 0arefugia 0anonindigenous1 aRuetz, Carl R.1 aUzarski, Donald G.1 aBurton, Thomas M.0 tJournal of Great Lakes research.g2007 June, v. 33, no. 2 p.303-313dInternational Association for Great Lakes Researchx0380-13307nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3394%2F0380-1330%282007%2933%5B303%3ADORGIC%5D2.0.CO%3B23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02766naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001500147245013200162300001800294520176800312592002802080650002002108650001602128650002602144650001302170650001002183650001202193650001402205700001202219700001602231773010302247856008102350852000902431655001202440IND60440339420221121211037.0151024e201509  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6044033942DNAL7 a10.1007/s11947-015-1547-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Wen10aNondestructive Measurement of Texture of Three Pear Varieties and Variety Discrimination by the Laser Doppler Vibrometer Method  ap. 1974-1981.  aThe laser Doppler vibrometer (LDV) method was used to measure the texture of three pear varieties (Pyrus pyrifolia cv. ‘Yuguan,’ ‘Whangkeumbae,’ and ‘Hosui’) and discriminate pear variety. Firstly, vibration characteristics of pears were measured. The second and third resonance frequencies (f ₂ and f ₃) and the amplitudes at f ₂ and f ₃ (A ₂ and A ₃) were extracted from the amplitude-frequency response. Elasticity indices (EI ᵢ) were calculated by f ᵢ ² m ²/³, i = 2, 3, where m is the mass of the sample. Then, pear texture was detected by the puncture test with and without peel, respectively. Maximum force (MF), flesh firmness (FF), and stiffness (Stif) were extracted from the force-deformation (F-D) curve as texture indices. The results showed that texture indices were well correlated with EI ᵢ but poorly with the amplitudes for all the three pear varieties. There was no obvious difference in correlation coefficients (r) of EI ᵢ with peeled and unpeeled texture indices. Stif had higher correlation coefficient with EI ᵢ (r = 0.866–0.962) than MF and FF. Additionally, Stif was still well correlated with EI ᵢ for all the samples of three varieties together (r = 0.894–0.908). Fisher’s discriminant analysis (FDA) was conducted to discriminate the three pear varieties. EI ₂, EI ₃, A ₂, A ₃, R ₁ (A ₂/EI ₂), and R ₂ (A ₃/EI ₃) were selected as indicators. It was found that ‘Yuguan’ pears could be discriminated from other pear varieties, but ‘Whangkeumbae’ and ‘Hosui’ pears could not be. Therefore, nondestructive measurement of texture of different pear varieties by the LDV method was feasible, and this method has the potential for pear variety discrimination.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPyrus pyrifolia 3acorrelation 3adiscriminant analysis 3afirmness 3apears 3atexture 3avibration1 aCui, Di1 aYing, Yibin0 tFood and bioprocess technology.g2015 Sept., v. 8, no. 9 p.1974-1981dSpringer USx1935-51307nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11947-015-1547-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03598naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245013200169520225900301592002802560650004102588650001602629650001202645650002902657650001902686650002402705650001002729650000902739650001902748650002502767650001602792650001802808653002502826653002702851653003802878653004002916700001902956773011802975856008603093852000903179655001203188IND60714955120221119231001.0210506e20210101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071495512DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jenvman.2020.1113932doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCha, Sung Min10aAdvanced hydrological streamflow simulation in a watershed using adjusted radar-rainfall estimates as meteorological input data  aAmong the input data of the watershed model for simulating changes of flowrate in the watershed, weather input data, especially input data related to rainfall, are the most important. Therefore, it is important to ensure the accuracy of rainfall input data to increase the accuracy of the watershed model results. Securing rainfall measurements with finer spatial and temporal resolutions is important in predicting flowrate variations at a sub-catchment, especially as they relate to global and local climate changes in weather conditions such as rainfall depth, rainfall intensity, etc. In this study, adjusted radar-rainfall estimates were suggested as alternative input data for watershed modeling. Through a statistical analysis of the representativeness of a ground rainfall measurement (10 km × 10 km grid), the necessity of radar-rainfall estimates (2 km × 2 km grid) was identified. By applying calibration factors to initial radar-rainfall estimates and comparing adjusted radar-rainfall estimates with ground rainfall measurements, it was proven that adjusted radar-rainfall estimates could be used as input data for watershed simulations (NSE > 0.92; n = 12). Adjusted radar-rainfall estimates and ground rainfall measurements were used as input data of the Soil and Water Assessment Tool model to predict flowrate variations at the outlets of a tributary and the entire watershed. As a result, the accuracies of the simulation results were improved for the outlets of a tributary and the entire watershed (NSE: 0.33 to 0.48 and 0.19 to 0.55, respectively). To obtain more reliable rainfall data, radar images easily accessible to users were applied, and the accuracy of the data was increased by applying simple equations to numerical data extracted from radar image processing. Additionally, the applicability of the adjusted radar-rainfall estimates was demonstrated by comparing the modeling results using the suggested rainfall data and existing ground-based rainfall data. The suggested methodologies are expected to contribute to more accurately predict the possibility of flood disasters in other regions and countries lacking infrastructure related to rainfall measurements and to establish appropriate countermeasures.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSoil and Water Assessment Tool model 3acalibration 3aclimate 3aenvironmental management 3ainfrastructure 3ameteorological data 3aradar 3arain 3arain intensity 3astatistical analysis 3astream flow 3asubwatersheds 0aWeather radar images 0aRadar image processing 0aAdjusted radar-rainfall estimates 0aSoil & water assessment tool (SWAT)1 aLee, Seung Won0 tJournal of environmental management.g2021 Jan. 01, v. 277 p.111393-dElsevier LtdwJournal:2018x0301-47977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2020.1113933Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03171naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100005500147245011900202300001800321520132100339592002801660596005901688596006901747650002301816650001701839650001701856650002001873650001401893650001001907650001001917650002401927650002101951650001801972650002101990650001702011650001402028650002602042650002002068650002602088653002302114653002102137700001802158700001602176700002102192700001802213700001602231700001602247700005502263700005602318773015302374856008102527852000902608655001202617IND60662764920221120130554.0190906e201909  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066276492DNAL7 a10.1094/MPMI-01-19-0033-R2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLan, Huahui1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3921-813314aThe HosA Histone Deacetylase Regulates Aflatoxin Biosynthesis Through Direct Regulation of Aflatoxin Cluster Genes  ap. 1210-1228.  aHistone deacetylases (HDACs) always function as corepressors and sometimes as coactivators in the regulation of fungal development and secondary metabolite production. However, the mechanism through which HDACs play positive roles in secondary metabolite production is still unknown. Here, classical HDAC enzymes were identified and analyzed in Aspergillus flavus, a fungus that produces one of the most carcinogenic secondary metabolites, aflatoxin B₁ (AFB1). Characterization of the HDACs revealed that a class I family HDAC, HosA, played crucial roles in growth, reproduction, the oxidative stress response, AFB1 biosynthesis, and pathogenicity. To a lesser extent, a class II family HDAC, HdaA, was also involved in sclerotia formation and AFB1 biosynthesis. An in vitro analysis of HosA revealed that its HDAC activity was considerably diminished at nanomolar concentrations of trichostatin A. Notably, chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments indicated that HosA bound directly to AFB1 biosynthesis cluster genes to regulate their expression. Finally, we found that a transcriptional regulator, SinA, interacts with HosA to regulate fungal development and AFB1 biosynthesis. Overall, our results reveal a novel mechanism by which classical HDACs mediate the induction of secondary metabolite genes in fungi.  aPublisher supplied data  a31772105cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a2018J07002cNatural Science Foundation of Fujian Province, China 3aAspergillus flavus 3aaflatoxin B1 3abiosynthesis 3acarcinogenicity 3achromatin 3afungi 3agenes 3ahistone deacetylase 3aoxidative stress 3apathogenicity 3aprecipitin tests 3areproduction 3asclerotia 3asecondary metabolites 3astress response 3atranscription factors 0afungal development 0afungal effectors1 aWu, Lianghuan1 aSun, Ruilin1 aKeller, Nancy P.1 aYang, Kunlong1 aYe, Liuqing1 aHe, Shuibin1 aZhang, Feng1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2593-99811 aWang, Shihua1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1544-59720 tMolecular plant-microbe interactions.g2019 Sept., v. 32, no. 9 p.1210-1228dMolecular Plant-Microbe InteractionswJournal:jnl43555x0894-02827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094/MPMI-01-19-0033-R3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02858naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001700145245012300162300002000285500001900305520146800324592002801792650001501820650001501835650001901850650002401869650002201893650002601915650001701941650000901958650001901967650001801986650001502004650001302019650001502032700001802047700005502065700001702120700005702137773014202194856007902336852000902415655001202424IND60675337020221120092016.0191105e20190826xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067533702DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.est.9b027872doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Lidong10aRegulating Phase Separation Behavior of a DEEA–TETA Biphasic Solvent Using Sulfolane for Energy-Saving CO₂ Capture  ap. 12873-12881.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aBiphasic solvents containing mixed amines have a phase separation behavior and energy-efficient regeneration for CO₂ capture. However, the trade-off between the CO₂ absorption capacity and the volume ratio of the CO₂-rich phase presents a critical challenge to the reducing potential in regeneration energy consumption. In this study, sulfolane was proposed to regulate the phase separation behavior of a N,N-diethylethanolamine (DEEA)–triethylenetetramine (TETA) biphasic absorbent by simultaneously decreasing the volume ratio and increasing the CO₂ loading of the rich phase, without sacrificing the high CO₂ capacity. In the DEEA–TETA–sulfolane biphasic absorbent, sulfolane acted as a phase splitter and physical activator. The replacement of a part of H₂O by hydrophobic sulfolane contributed to a substantial decrease in the volume ratio of the rich phase from 83 to 39% and an increase in CO₂ loading of the rich phase from 3.10 to 4.92 mol/L. The regeneration heat decreased to 1.81 GJ/t CO₂, 26.4% less than DEEA–TETA, and 54.6% less than the 5 M monoethanolamine system. Moreover, by promoting the mass transfer coefficient of CO₂ in DEEA–TETA–sulfolane to 1.8 times the original DEEA–TETA system, sulfolane was validated as a physical activator. Our study provides a promising strategy for regulating the phase separation behavior of biphasic solvents and enhancing the regeneration energy efficiency for CO₂ capture.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorbents 3aabsorption 3acarbon dioxide 3aenergy conservation 3aenergy efficiency 3aenvironmental science 3aethanolamine 3aheat 3ahydrophobicity 3amass transfer 3aseparation 3asolvents 3atechnology1 aLiu, Shanshan1 aWang, Rujie1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7144-14501 aLi, Qiangwei1 aZhang, Shihan1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2377-57600 tEnvironmental science & technology.g2019 Aug. 26, v. 53, no. 21 p.12873-12881dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23339x1520-58517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.est.9b027873Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03144naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001600152245013600168300001600304520167600320592002801996650002502024650001702049650001202066650001302078650002102091650002002112650001102132650001402143650002202157650002002179650001802199650002402217650000902241650001002250650004002260700001302300700001502313700001502328700001502343700001302358700001702371700001502388700001502403700001502418700001402433773008402447856008602531852000902617655001202626IND60096247220221120175615.0141104e201106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009624722DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cryobiol.2011.03.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAbedini, S.10aEffects of cryopreservation with a newly-developed magnetic field programmed freezer on periodontal ligament cells and pulp tissues  ap. 181-187.  aThe purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of long-term cryopreservation on the isolated human periodontal ligament cells (PDL) and pulp tissues.

As for the control group, freshly extracted teeth were used. In each group, extracted PDL tissues were cultured and gene expression and protein concentration of collagen type I, alkaline-phosphatase (ALP) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) was compared between the two groups. In the second part, pulp tissues were obtained from 10 mature and immature third molars which were freshly extracted or cryopreserved for three months. Expression of VEGF and nerve growth factor (NGF) mRNAs and the protein concentration in the supernatant were investigated. Results indicated that long-term cryopreservation with the use of CAS freezer cannot affect the growth rate and characteristics of PDL cells. There was no significant difference in VEGF expression and VEGF and NGF protein concentration of pulp cells derived from cryopreserved teeth with immature apex and control group with mature root formation. Finally, proper PDL regeneration and appropriate apexogenesis after transplanting magnetically cryopreserved immature tooth was clinically confirmed. These findings demonstrate that teeth banking with the use of magnetic field programmed freezer can be available for future autotransplantation as a treatment modality for replacing missing teeth.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalkaline phosphatase 3aautografting 3abanking 3acollagen 3acryopreservation 3agene expression 3ahumans 3aligaments 3along term effects 3amagnetic fields 3amessenger RNA 3anerve growth factor 3apulp 3ateeth 3avascular endothelial growth factors1 aKaku, M.1 aKawata, T.1 aKoseki, H.1 aKojima, S.1 aSumi, H.1 aMotokawa, M.1 aFujita, T.1 aOhtani, J.1 aOhwada, N.1 aTanne, K.0 tCryobiology.g2011 June, v. 62, no. 3 p.181-187dElsevier Inc.x0011-22407nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cryobiol.2011.03.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02331naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100002000166245011600186300001800302520081700320592002801137650002201165650001701187650000901204650001201213650001901225650001201244650001201256650002701268650003801295650002101333650002401354650002401378650002201402650004301424650005901467651001901526651001901545700002001564700001701584700002101601700002201622700001901644773011701663856004801780852000901828655001201837IND50063536220221118075921.0130325e201304  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006353622DNAL7 a228645812pmid7 a10.1007/s10661-012-2796-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aValová, Zdenka10aNo relationship found between mercury and lead concentrations in muscle and scales of chub Squalius cephalus L.  ap. 3359-3368.  aWe examined the relationship between muscle and scale mercury (Hg) and lead (Pb) concentrations in chub Squalius cephalus L. from six riverine sites in the Czech Republic in order to determine whether scale analysis alone could provide a nonlethal and convenient method for prediction of heavy metal concentration in muscle tissue. Our results confirm tissue-specific heavy metal accumulation in chub, with Hg tending to accumulate primarily in muscle tissue and Pb in scales. We found no significant relationship, however, for concentrations of either Pb or Hg between muscle tissue and scales of chub. Our results indicate that scales cannot be used for predicting heavy metal contamination in muscle of chub and we recommend, therefore, that muscle biopsy methods continue as the preferred method of analysis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSqualius cephalus 3aheavy metals 3alead 3amercury 3amuscle tissues 3amuscles 2aAnimals 2aCyprinidaexmetabolism 2aEnvironmental Monitoringxmethods 2aLeadxmetabolism 2aMercuryxmetabolism 2aMusclesxmetabolism 2aRiversxchemistry 2aWater Pollutants, Chemicalxmetabolism 2aWater Pollution, Chemicalxstatistics & numerical data 3aCzech Republic 0aCzech Republic1 aHudcová, Hana,1 aRoche, Kevin1 aSvobodová, Jana1 aBernardová, Ilja1 aJurajda, Pavel0 tEnvironmental monitoring and assessment.g2013 Apr., v. 185, no. 4 p.3359-3368dSpringer-Verlagx0167-63697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-012-2796-5  aDNAL 7aarticle02292naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001500139245007100154300001600225520129200241592002801533650001401561650000901575650001201584650002201596650001101618650001101629650001201640650001901652700001701671700001501688700001501703700002001718773011001738856007301848852000901921655001201930IND60440556920221117111705.0151024e201512  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6044055692DNAL7 a10.1111/ahe.121512doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBlanke, A.10aHistological Study of the External, Middle and Inner Ear of Horses  ap. 401-409.  aClinical, anatomical and histological aspects of the equine acoustic organ have been poorly investigated and illustrated in literature so far. It is understood that an intact acoustic organ and hearing function are of vital importance for the well‐being of flight animals like horses. The knowledge of the acoustic organ is usually transferred analogously from other mammals to horses. The purpose of this study was to provide a detailed and complete histological description of the healthy equine auditory organ, and to determine its congruity to other mammalians. Anatomical dissections and histological preparations were carried out on ten cadaver heads. Specimens of various parts of the equine acoustic organ were taken and evaluated histologically. The histological composition of external, middle and inner ear structures are predominantly congruent to those of other mammals, especially to human beings. Unique inwardly directed rete pegs within the osseous ear canal and the prominent tensor tympani muscle are described for the first time. Results obtained in this study can be employed as references for further research on the equine acoustic organ and improve the understanding of the clinical development of hearing loss, otitis externa/media/interna or tympanosclerosis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacoustics 3aears 3ahearing 3ahearing disorders 3ahorses 3ahumans 3amuscles 3aotitis externa1 aAupperle, H.1 aSeeger, J.1 aKubick, C.1 aSchusser, G.

The biological forms were identified based on number of egg-ridges. Molecular characterization of biological forms was verified by analysis of the mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase subunit I and II (mtDNA-COI/COII). The Plasmodium infection was examined in the wild female specimens by species-specific nested–PCR method.Results showed that all three biological forms including mysorensis, intermediate and type are present in the study areas. Molecular investigations revealed no genetic variation between mtDNA COI/COII sequences of the biological forms and no Plasmodium parasites was detected in the collected mosquito samples.Presence of three biological forms with identical sequences showed that the known biological forms belong to a single taxon and the various vectorial capacities reported for these forms are more likely corresponded to other epidemiological factors than to the morphotype of the populations. Lack of malaria parasite infection in An. stephensi, the most important vector of malaria, may be partly due to the success and achievement of ongoing active malaria control program in the region.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aAnopheles stephensi 3aPlasmodium 3acytochrome-c oxidase 3afemales 3agenetic variation 3amalaria 3amitochondria 3amitochondrial DNA 3amorphs 3aparasites 3apolymerase chain reaction 3asporozoites 3aIran 0aMysorensis 0aType 0aIntermediate 0amtDNA markers 0aMolecular systematic1 aOshaghi, Mohammad Ali1 aVatandoost, Hasan1 aHanafi-Bojd, Ahmad Ali1 aRaeisi, Ahmad1 aNikpoor, Fatemeh0 tAsian Pacific Journal of Tropical Biomedicine.g2014 Jan., v. 4 p.47-51dElsevier B.V.x2221-16917nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S2221-1691(14)60207-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01488naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100001800112245007900130300001600209520043000225592002800655650001500683650002400698650001200722650001600734650001900750650002800769650002500797650002300822651001000845653001400855653003300869653001300902700002400915700002200939700003000961773011400991852000901105655001201114IND60524281920221119165602.0160705e201606  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052428192DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDanda, Shagun12aA New Species of Crotalaria (Fabaceae, Crotalarieae) from Meghalaya, India  ap. 307-315.  aA new species of Crotalaria from Meghalaya (Northeast India) is described and illustrated.

To develop more efficient molecular breeding tools to improve the odor/aroma on maize (Zea mays L.), a staple food crop, increasing the knowledge on the genetic basis of maize volatilome is needed. In this work, we conducted a genome-wide association study on a unique germplasm collection to identify genomic regions controlling maize wholemeal flour’s volatilome. We identified 64 regions on the maize genome and candidate genes controlling the levels of 15 volatiles, mainly aldehydes. As an example, the Zm00001d033623 gene was within a region associated with 2-octenal (E) and 2-nonenal (E), two byproducts of linoleic acid oxidation. This gene codes for linoleate 9S-lipoxygenase, an enzyme responsible for oxidizing linoleic acid. This knowledge can now support the development of molecular tools to increase the selection efficacy/efficiency of these volatiles within maize breeding programs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aZea mays 3acorn 3acorn flour 3aenzymes 3afood acceptability 3afood chemistry 3agenes 3agenome-wide association study 3agenomics 3agermplasm conservation 3alinoleic acid 3aodors 3aoxidation 3astaple crops 3awhole grain flour 0aZea mays L. 0avolatiles 0aaldehydes 0aPortuguese maize germplasm 0acandidate genes1 aBento-Silva, Andreia1 aGaspar, Daniel1 aPaulo, Manuel1 aBrites, Cláudia1 aMendes-Moreira, Pedro1 aBronze, Maria do Rosário1 aMalosetti, Marcos1 avan Eeuwijk, Fred1 aVaz Patto, Maria Carlota0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2020 June 23, v. 68, no. 29 p.7809-7818dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:12177x1520-51187nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jafc.0c012733Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/DA  aDNAL 7aarticle01544naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001400140245010900154300002000263520041800283592002800701650001400729650002300743650001100766650002000777650001000797650000900807650001300816650001400829700001600843700001800859700001800877700001900895700001200914700001300926773013600939856007401075852000901149655001201158IND60660982820221121084602.0190827e20150616xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066098282DNAL7 a10.1039/c5cc03009a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Li10aStructured Pd–Au/Cu-fiber catalyst for gas-phase hydrogenolysis of dimethyl oxalate to ethylene glycol  ap. 10547-10550.  aGalvanic co-deposition of 0.5 wt% Au and 0.1 wt% Pd on a microfibrous-structure using 8 μm Cu-fibers delivers a Pd–Au/Cu-fiber catalyst, which is highly active, selective and stable for the hydrogenolysis of dimethyl oxalate to ethylene glycol.

To better understand the role of the initial step in IAA esterification in the control of IAA levels, transgenic tomato plants were generated that either express maize IAGLU or have reduced levels of the enzyme IAA-glucose synthetase. These plants were obtained by expressing maize IAGLU in either sense or antisense orientation using the CaMV35S promoter. The maize IAGLU probe hybridized to two transcripts (1.3 kb and 2.5 kb) in wild-type tomato vegetative tissue and green fruit. The sense and antisense transformants exhibited distinct phenotypic characteristics. Sense transformants showed an almost complete lack of root initiation and development. Antisense transgenic plants, on the other hand, had unusually well developed root systems at early stages in development, and the amount of the endogenous 75 kDa IAGLU protein was reduced. IAGLU antisense plants also had reduced levels of IAA-glucose and lower esterified IAA.  aPublisher supplied data 3atransferases 3aplant development 3atransgenes 3awild relatives 3atransgenic plants 3atranscription (genetics) 3aesterification 3agene expression 3ahomeostasis 3agenetic variation 3aenzyme activity 3aroots 3aindole acetic acid 3aSolanum lycopersicum var. lycopersicum 0aplant hormones1 aSlovin, Janet P.1 aEpstein, Ephraim1 aCohen, Jerry D.0 tJournal of plant growth regulation.g2005 June, v. 24, no. 2 p.142-152dSpringer USx0721-75957nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00344-004-0007-53Available from publisher's site  a20060707b20060804c00000000  aINDdMKSe2006/07/07  aOther US 7aarticle02257naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245008200168300001600250520092200266592002801188650002201216650001301238650001501251650001301266650001201279650001401291650002801305650002601333650000901359650001201368650001401380650001401394650001301408650002101421650002101442650001301463650001501476650001701491650001401508650001001522650001101532773012801543856008201671961001301753852000901766655001201775IND60516396620221121045311.0190727e201304  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051639662DNAL7 a10.1017/S00144797120012992doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGOENAGA, RICARDO10aDry matter production and nutrient content of longan grown on an acid ultisol  ap. 225-233.  aLittle is known about the adaptability of longan (Dimocarpus longan) to acidic soils high in aluminum (Al). A two-year field study was conducted to determine the effects of various levels of soil Al on dry matter production, plant growth and nutrient content in shoots of four cultivars of longan. Soil Al and cultivars were statistically different for all variables measured in the study. Total leaf, petiole, stem and root dry weights significantly decreased at soil Al concentrations ranging from 5.1 to 12.1 cmol kg⁻¹ but this reduction was of a smaller magnitude in roots than in other organs. Increments in soil Al resulted in a significant reduction in the concentration of leaf Ca and a significant increase in leaf Al in all cultivars. Shoot content of N, P, K, Ca, Mg, Fe, Mn and Al declined with increase in soil Al. The result of this study demonstrates that longan is highly susceptible to acid soils.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDimocarpus longan 3aUltisols 3aacid soils 3aaluminum 3acalcium 3acultivars 3adry matter accumulation 3afield experimentation 3airon 3alongans 3amagnesium 3amanganese 3anitrogen 3anitrogen content 3anutrient content 3apetioles 3aphosphorus 3aplant growth 3apotassium 3aroots 3ashoots0 tExperimental agriculture.g2013 Apr., v. 49, no. 2 p.225-233dCambridge University PresswJournal:jnl46155x1469-44417nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S00144797120012993Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/ARS  aDNAL 7aarticle03499naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245005700168300001800225520208700243592002802330650002002358650001202378650002302390650001302413650002302426650001202449650001802461650001202479650001902491650001402510650001402524650001302538650001502551650002202566650001602588650001302604653001002617653002302627653001702650653001702667653002102684653002402705700002002729700002102749700001802770773009902788856008502887852000902972655001202981IND60635498520221118063706.0190401e20180716xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063549852DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vaccine.2018.05.1202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHsiao, Amber14aThe health economics of cholera: A systematic review  ap. 4404-4424.  aVibrio cholera is a major contributor of diarrheal illness that causes significant morbidity and mortality globally. While there is literature on the health economics of diarrheal illnesses more generally, few studies have quantified the cost-of-illness and cost-effectiveness of cholera-specific prevention and control interventions. The present systematic review provides a comprehensive overview of the literature specific to cholera as it pertains to key health economic measures.A systematic review was performed with no date restrictions up through February 2017 in PubMed, Econlit, Embase, Web of Science, and Cochrane Review to identify relevant health economics of cholera literature. After removing duplicates, a total of 1993 studies were screened and coded independently by two reviewers, resulting in 22 relevant studies. Data on population, methods, and results (cost-of-illness and cost-effectiveness of vaccination) were compared by country/region. All costs were adjusted to 2017 USD for comparability.Costs per cholera case were found to be rather low: <$100 per case in most settings, even when costs incurred by patients/families and lost productivity are considered. When wider socioeconomic costs are included, estimated costs are >$1000/case. There is adequate evidence to support the economic value of vaccination for the prevention and control of cholera when vaccination is targeted at high-incidence populations and/or areas with high case fatality rates due to cholera. When herd immunity is considered, vaccination also becomes a cost-effective option for the general population and is comparable in cost-effectiveness to other routine immunizations.Cholera vaccination is a viable short-to-medium term option, especially as the upfront costs of building water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) infrastructure are considerably higher for countries that face a significant burden of cholera. While WASH may be the more cost-effective solution in the long-term when implemented properly, cholera vaccination can still be a feasible, cost-effective strategy.  aPublisher supplied data 3aVibrio cholerae 3acholera 3acost effectiveness 3adiarrhea 3aeconomic valuation 3aenzymes 3aherd immunity 3ahygiene 3ainfrastructure 3amorbidity 3amortality 3apatients 3asanitation 3asystematic review 3avaccination 3avaccines 0aCosts 0aCost-effectiveness 0aCost-benefit 0aCost-utility 0aHealth economics 0aInfectious diseases1 aHall, Angela H.1 aMogasale, Vittal1 aQuentin, Wilm0 tVaccine.g2018 July 16, v. 36, no. 30 p.4404-4424dElsevier LtdwJournal:6210x0264-410X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2018.05.1203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01426naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002000140245016100160300002000321520033400341592002800675650001100703650002300714650001100737650002100748650001100769650001600780650001400796700001700810700002100827700002100848773013600869856007401005852000901079655001201088IND60660982920221121084644.0190827e20150813xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066098292DNAL7 a10.1039/c5cc03012a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKotani, Hiroaki10aEnhancement of 4-electron O₂ reduction by a Cu(ii)–pyridylamine complex via protonation of a pendant pyridine in the second coordination sphere in water  ap. 13385-13388.  aWe have synthesised a novel copper(ii) complex with a pyridine pendant as a proton relay port for electrocatalytic 4e⁻ reduction of O₂ in water.

Recent phylogenetic studies confirm its monophyly and indicate that it forms a clade with two other endemic genera, Gongrodiscus and Podonephelium. Storthocalyx is characterized by leaflets with a glaucous lower surface (due to the presence of papillae) and a lack of domatia, actinomorphic flowers, distinct sepals, petals with many long trichomes and lacking appendages, and a three-locular capsule whose inner surface is covered with a dense indument. As part of a collaborative effort to clarify the taxonomy of New Caledonian Sapindaceae, a revision of Storthocalyx is presented. Species delimitation is based on results from a recently published multivariate morphometric analysis, and descriptions were prepared using the resulting data matrix coupled with examination of all available herbarium collections and extensive field observations. Five species are recognized, including one that is newly described (Storthocalyx corymbosus). A key to species is provided, along with descriptions, distribution maps, color photos, a line drawing (for the new species), and risk of extinction assessments following IUCN red list categories and criteria.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSapindaceae 3aappendages 3acalyx 3acolor 3acorolla 3aextinction 3aforests 3aherbaria 3amonophyly 3amorphometry 3anew species 3aplant taxonomy 3arisk 3ashrublands 3ataxonomic keys 3ataxonomic revisions 3atrichomes 0aConservation status 0anew species 0ataxonomy1 aLowry, Porter P.1 aBuerki, Sven1 aCallmander, Martin W.0 tSystematic botany.g2016 June, v. 41, no. 2 p.387-400dAmerican Society of Plant Toxonomistsx0363-64457nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle02740naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094024002200133024001900155040001800174100001800192245013300210300001400343506007600357520121600433592002801649506003701677650001701714650001901731650001601750650002801766650001401794650001701808650001801825650001301843650001501856650001401871651001001885653003301895653002001928653002901948700002301977700001602000700001602016700002402032773010802056856008502164852000902249655001202258IND60555201220221207052901.0161026e201401  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055520122DNAL7 a10.1016/S2221-1691(14)60209-42doi7 aPMC38194972pmcid7 a241441322pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPoudel, Bibek10aSerum uric acid level in newly diagnosed essential hypertension in a Nepalese population: A hospital based cross sectional study  ap. 59-64.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aTo develop the missing link between hyperuricemia and hypertension.The study was conducted in Department of Biochemistry in collaboration with Nephrology Unit of Internal Medicine Department.

Patient demographics were included in the questionnaire. A similar questionnaire was administered to prenatal care providers. Patient influenza and Tdap vaccination acceptance rates were compared and predictors of vaccine acceptance were analyzed with bivariate logistic regression.Out of the 400 patient questionnaires distributed, 338 (84.5%) were completed and returned; 24 of 45 (53.3%) provider questionnaires were returned. Vaccination acceptance rates were 70.7% for the influenza vaccine and 76.3% for the Tdap vaccine. The logistic regression model indicated that predictors of acceptance for either vaccine in pregnancy are patient attitude and previous vaccination history. Patient attitudes were more favorable towards Tdap than influenza vaccination. The combination of healthcare provider recommendation and educational materials was significantly predictive of both Tdap and influenza vaccine acceptance. The most common reasons given for declining the influenza vaccine were safety concerns; the most common reasons given for declining the Tdap vaccine were that patients did not think it was required again when they received the vaccine before pregnancy.Our study suggests that providers can improve Tdap and influenza vaccination acceptance in pregnancy by recommending the vaccination in combination with provision of educational materials on the vaccines.  aPublisher supplied data 3aattitudes and opinions 3ademographic statistics 3aeducational materials 3ahealth care workers 3ainfluenza 3ainfluenza vaccination 3ainfluenza vaccines 3apatients 3apregnancy 3apregnant women 3aprenatal care 3aquestionnaires 3aregression analysis 3atetanus 0aDiphtheria 0aPertussis 0aTdap 0aVaccination 0aVaccine 0aTdap 0aCDC 0aACOG 0aPRAMS 0aACIP 0aUSA 0aECARN 0aPHI 0aUS1 aPower, Michael1 aSchulkin, Jay1 aStark, Lauren M.1 aMackeen, A.

To optimize operation, the combined effect of water temperature, hydraulic residence time (HRT), and filter design is fundamental. This 2‐yr study evaluated a combination of three flow designs and two woodchips mixtures at a test facility receiving agricultural drainage discharge from a 78‐ha catchment. The biofilter test facility consisted of six independent parallel‐constructed wetlands (CW1–CW6), with two types of filter mixtures and three different hydraulic designs (horizontal, vertical upward, and vertical downward flow). Horizontal CWs performed best with an annual removal of total N (TN) amounting to 53 to 54% of the load, corresponding to a daily removal of 2.16 to 2.32 g N m⁻³ d⁻¹. Removal by the vertical CWs amounted to 38 to 60% of the TN load or 1.19 to 2.31 g N m⁻³ d⁻¹. Despite low temperatures and HRT down to 3 h, all CWs functioned well in winter with 20 to 30% N removal. In contrast, during summer when the hydraulic load was low and HRT was up to >96 h, N removal was ∼100%, and the reduction sequence proceeded with sulfate reduction and formation of H₂S. Statistical analysis and model development revealed that the percentage removal of both TN and nitrate N was mostly dependent on water temperature and HRT, explaining 81.7 to 91.1 and 83.5 to 89.5% of the variation, respectively. CORE IDEAS: The hydraulic design influences seasonal and annual N removal efficiency. Water temperature and hydraulic residence time control N removal efficiency. Operational models can be used for dimensioning biofilters for N removal efficiency.  aPublisher supplied data  a09‐067280cThe Danish Strategic Research Council 3abiofilters 3adrainage 3aenvironmental quality 3anitrate nitrogen 3anitrogen 3astatistical analysis 3asubsurface flow 3asulfates 3asummer 3atotal nitrogen 3awater temperature 3awatersheds 3awinter 3awood chips1 aLarsen, Søren Erik1 aKjaergaard, Charlotte0 tJournal of environmental quality.g2019 Nov., v. 48, no. 6 p.1881-1889dThe American Society of Agronomy, Crop Science Society of America, and Soil Science Society of America, Inc.wJournal:jnl1642x0047-24257nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2134/jeq2018.12.04423Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03056naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002000146245009500166300001800261500001900279520165100298592002801949650001601977650002201993650002202015650002002037650001302057650001902070650001102089650000902100650001602109653001702125653003102142653002402173653001502197653001302212653001502225700002002240700002102260700002202281700005802303773014802361856008002509852000902589655001202598IND60704242320221121033346.0200722e20200612xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070424232DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jafc.0c016472doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJung, Hyungtaek10aComparative Evaluation of Genome Assemblers from Long-Read Sequencing for Plants and Crops  ap. 7670-7677.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe availability of recent state-of-the-art long-read sequencing technologies has significantly increased the ease and speed of producing high-quality plant genome assemblies. A wide variety of genome-related software tools are now available and they are typically benchmarked using microbial or model eukaryotic genomes such as Arabidopsis and rice. However, many plant species have much larger and more complex genomes than these, and the choice of tools, parameters, and/or strategies that can be used is not always obvious. Thus, we have compared the metrics of assemblies generated by various pipelines to discuss how assembly quality can be affected by two different assembly strategies. First, we focused on optimizing read preprocessing and assembler variables using eight different de novo assemblers on five different Pacific Biosciences long-read datasets of diploid and tetraploid species. Then, we examined a single scaffolding tool (quickmerge) that has been employed for the postprocessing step. We then merged the outputs from multiple assemblies to produce a higher quality consensus assembly. Then, we benchmarked the assemblies for completeness and accuracy (assembly metrics and BUSCO), computer memory, and CPU times. Two lightweight assemblers, Miniasm/Minimap/Racon and WTDBG, were deemed good for novice users because they involved smaller required learning curves and light computational resources. However, two heavyweight tools, CANU and Flye, should be the first choice when the goal is to achieve accurate and complete assemblies. Our results will provide valuable guidance in future plant genome projects and beyond.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArabidopsis 3acomputer hardware 3acomputer software 3adata collection 3adiploidy 3afood chemistry 3agenome 3arice 3atetraploidy 0aplant genome 0anext-generation sequencing 0aPacific Biosciences 0along reads 0ananopore 0aassemblers1 aJeon, Min-Seung1 aHodgett, Matthew1 aWaterhouse, Peter1 aEyun, Seong-il1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4687-10660 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2020 June 12, v. 68, no. 29 p.7670-7677dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:12177x1520-51187nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jafc.0c016473Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02798naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002200150245011300172520134600285592002801631650001601659650001301675650001601688650003301704650002201737650001101759650002401770650001201794650003601806650001901842650002001861650001701881653002101898653001601919653002001935653002801955653002401983653002102007700002802028700002302056700001502079700001902094773012102113856008502234852000902319655001202328IND60682175120221119001716.0200318e20200301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068217512DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbabio.2020.1481562doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMascoli, Vincenzo10aDesign principles of solar light harvesting in plants: Functional architecture of the monomeric antenna CP29  aIn plants and green algae, light-harvesting complexes (LHCs) are a large family of chlorophyll binding proteins functioning as antennae, collecting solar photons and transferring the absorbed energy to the photosynthetic reaction centers, where light to chemical energy conversion begins. Although LHCs are all highly homologous in their structure and display a variety of common features, each complex finds a specific location and task in the energy transport. One example is CP29, which occupies a pivotal position in Photosystem II, bridging the peripheral antennae to the core. The design principles behind this specificity, however, are still unclear.Here, a synergetic approach combining steady-state and ultrafast spectroscopy, mutational analysis and structure-based exciton modeling allows uncovering the energy landscape of the chlorophylls bound to this complex. We found that, although displaying an overall highly conserved exciton structure very similar to that of other LHCs, CP29 possesses an additional terminal emitter domain. The simultaneous presence of two low energy sites facing the peripheral antennae and the core, allows CP29 to efficiently work as a conduit in the energy flux. Our results show that the LHCs share a common solid architecture but have finely tuned their structure to carry out specific functions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChlorophyta 3aantennae 3achlorophyll 3achlorophyll binding proteins 3aenergy conversion 3amodels 3amutational analysis 3aphotons 3aphotosynthetic reaction centers 3aphotosystem II 3asolar radiation 3aspectroscopy 0aLight harvesting 0aChlorophyll 0aEnergy transfer 0aElectronic spectroscopy 0aMutational analysis 0aExciton modeling1 aNovoderezhkin, Vladimir1 aLiguori, Nicoletta1 aXu, Pengqi1 aCroce, Roberta0 tBiochimica et biophysica acta.g2020 Mar. 01, v. 1861, no. 3 p.148156-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:1927x0005-27287nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbabio.2020.1481563Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01542naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002100150245013000171300001800301520052800319592002800847653001600875653001700891653001900908653001400927653001300941653002200954700001800976773015100994856008601145852000901231655001201240IND60130982120221121003212.0151127s2008    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013098212DNAL7 a10.4289/0013-8797-110.4.10282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMcPherson, J.

Accordingly, it was introduced in Nagaland. This paper is an attempt to explore the constraints involved in the implementation of IWMP and measures for mitigation of constraints. Accordingly, Wokha district of Nagaland was purposively selected for the study. Total of 120 beneficiaries was purposively selected from 12 villages (10 beneficiaries from each village). To assess the constraints, a list containing 24 constraints was prepared after thorough research from literature and assuming the local condition of the study area. The constraints were ranked based on the frequencies of response against each constraint. Among the constraints, ‘Lack of post-harvest technologies’, ‘Technology being capital and labour intensive’, ‘Lack of transport facilities’, ‘Lack of skilled labour’, ‘Lack of technical knowledge’, ‘Non availability of good quality equipment and implements to construct conservation structures’ were some of the most commonly faced constraints. Further, provision of providing rubber roller, provision of proper market linkage for the produces, the inclusion of a greater number of beneficiaries under different livelihood activities and provision of training on tapping of rubber emerged as remedial measures as provided by the beneficiaries.  aPublisher supplied data 3acapital 3aequipment 3alabor 3alivelihood 3amarkets 3apostharvest technology 3apoverty 3arubber 3arural population 3avillages 3awatershed management 3awatersheds 3aIndia 0aBeneficiaries 0aConstraints 0aIWMP 0aRanking 0aSuggestions1 aPatra, N.K.1 aJha, K.K.1 aLongkumer, J.0 tJournal of Community Mobilization and Sustainable Development.g2019 Sept., v. 14, no. 3 p.517-522dSociety for Community Mobilization for Sustainable DevelopmentwJournal:2289x2231-67367nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle02380naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100001800112245008500130300001600215520122900231592002801460650002801488650001601516650002701532650002001559650001401579650001701593650002001610650001601630651001001646653002001656653002001676653002101696653002701717700002701744700002801771773019801799852000901997655001202006IND60706289220221121203417.0201224e201909  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070628922DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aManda, Satish10aTechno-economic Evaluation of Solar Photovoltaic Operated Drip Irrigation System  ap. 523-528.  aIrrigation is one of the major consumers of electricity that is supplied mostly from conventional electricity sources across the globe. However, these sources of electricity generation are depleting fast and causing environmental pollution. Renewable energy sources are sustainable and eco-friendly alternatives, and solar photovoltaic (PV) is the most attractive among them. To get the wider acceptance of solar power in the field of agriculture, the scientific information regarding the technical performance and economical viability of solar photovoltaic (SPV) operated irrigation system has great importance. In this study, the techno-economic evaluation of SPV operated submersible pump and drip irrigation system is investigated. The experiment has been conducted during Rabi season for varying solar irradiance and temperature conditions at IIT Kharagpur, West Bengal, India. The effect of solar irradiance on drip irrigation was analyzed and found that maximum emission uniformity for the system is achieved during 11: 00 AM to 2: 00 PM of about 94 per cent. The LCC analysis shows that the SPV system is preferable than DG set. The payback period for SPV and DG set is found as 2.5 years and 4.5 years respectively.  aPublisher supplied data 3aeconomic sustainability 3aelectricity 3aelectricity generation 3amicroirrigation 3apollution 3asolar energy 3asolar radiation 3atemperature 3aIndia 0aDrip irrigation 0aLife cycle cost 0aSolar PV pumping 0aUniformity coefficient1 aHadole, Mahesh Vinayak1 aTiwari, Kamlesh Narayan0 tJournal of Community Mobilization and Sustainable Development.g2019 Sept., v. 14, no. 3 p.523-528dSociety for Community Mobilization for Sustainable DevelopmentwJournal:2289x2231-67367nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle02290naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002300147245008000170300001600250520102500266592002801291650001901319650001101338650002501349650001401374650001301388650001401401650002401415650001501439650001601454650002401470650001901494700002301513700002201536700002201558700002001580700002201600700001801622773010301640856008101743990002301824852000901847655001201856IND60093403220221118172058.0141103e20120213xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009340322DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ces.2011.11.0242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMikulčić, Hrvoje10aNumerical modelling of calcination reaction mechanism for cement production  ap. 607-615.  aCalcination is a thermo-chemical process, widely used in the cement industry, where limestone is converted by thermal decomposition into lime CaO and carbon dioxide CO₂. The focus of this paper is on the implementation and validation of the endothermic calcination reaction mechanism of limestone in a commercial finite volume based CFD code. This code is used to simulate the turbulent flow field, the temperature field, concentrations of the reactants and products, as well as the interaction of particles with the gas phase, by solving the mathematical equations, which govern these processes. For calcination, the effects of temperature, decomposition pressure, diffusion and pore efficiency were taken into account. A simple three-dimensional geometry of a pipe reactor was used for numerical simulations. To verify the accuracy of the modelling approach, the numerical predictions were compared with experimental data, yielding satisfying results and proper trends of physical parameters influencing the process.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon dioxide 3acement 3achemical engineering 3aequations 3aindustry 3alimestone 3amathematical models 3aprediction 3atemperature 3athermal degradation 3aturbulent flow1 avon Berg, Eberhard1 aVujanović, Milan1 aPriesching, Peter1 aPerković, Luka1 aTatschl, Reinhard1 aDuić, Neven,0 tChemical engineering science.g2012 Feb. 13, v. 69, no. 1 p.607-615dElsevier Ltdx0009-25097nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ces.2011.11.0243Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03463naa a2200649 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002600147245019900173300001600372520150300388592002801891650001301919650001601932650002601948650002501974650001601999650002102015650001102036650001602047650001602063650001502079650001202094650001202106650002402118650001802142650000902160650002402169650000902193700001902202700002302221700001702244700001902261700001802280700001602298700001802314700001602332700001502348700001802363700001902381700002002400700001702420700002402437700001702461700001802478700002102496700001902517700002302536700002302559773012802582856008202710852000902792655001202801IND60516396920221121045519.0190727e201304  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051639692DNAL7 a10.1017/S00144797120013302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSANKAR, G.

The study was conducted to assess the effect of conventional tillage (CT), low tillage + interculture (LT1) and low tillage + herbicide (LT2) together with 100% N (organic) (F1), 50% N (organic) + 50% N (inorganic) (F2) and 100% N (inorganic) (F3) on productivity, profitability, rainwater and energy use efficiencies. The results at Varanasi revealed that CT was superior with mean yield of 2389 kg ha⁻¹, while F1 was superior with 2378 kg ha⁻¹ in rice. At Faizabad, CT was superior with mean rice yield of 1851 kg ha⁻¹ and lentil yield of 977 kg ha⁻¹, while F1 was superior with 1704 and 993 kg ha⁻¹ of rice and lentil, respectively. At Phulbani, F2 was superior with rice yield of 1170 kg ha⁻¹. At Ranchi, F2 with rice yield of 986 kg ha⁻¹ and F3 with linseed yield of 224 kg ha⁻¹ were superior. The regression model of crop seasonal rainfall and yield deviations indicated an increasing trend in rice yield over mean (positive deviation) with increase in rainfall at all locations; while a decreasing trend (negative deviation) was found for lentil at Faizabad, horse gram at Phulbani and linseed at Ranchi.

The strength of these shifts may depend on the availability of individuals with trait values adapted to new environmental conditions, represented by the functional diversity (FD) of existing community residents or dispersal from the regional species pool. We conducted a 3-year nutrient- and seed-addition experiment in old-field plant communities to examine the contributions of species turnover and intraspecific variation to community trait shifts, focusing on four key plant functional traits: vegetative height, leaf area, specific leaf area (SLA), and leaf dry matter content (LDMC). We further examined the influence of initial FD and seed availability on the strength of these shifts. Community mean height, leaf area, and SLA increased in response to fertilization, and these shifts were driven almost entirely by intraspecific variation. The strength of intraspecific shifts in height and leaf area was positively related to initial intraspecific FD in these traits. Intraspecific trait responses to fertilization varied among species, with species of short stature displaying stronger shifts in SLA and LDMC but weaker shifts in leaf area. Trait shifts due to species turnover were generally weak and opposed intraspecific responses. Seed addition altered community taxonomic composition but had little effect on community trait shifts. These results highlight the importance of intraspecific variation for short-term community functional responses and demonstrate that the strength of these responses may be mediated by community FD.  aPublisher supplied data 3adry matter content 3aenvironmental factors 3afunctional diversity 3aintraspecific variation 3aleaf area 3aplant communities1 aRitchie, Mark E.0 tOecologia.g2016 May, v. 181, no. 1 p.245-255dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx0029-85497nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00442-016-3563-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01466naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002000140245008900160300002000249520032700269592002800596650002400624650002300648650002000671650001900691650000900710650001200719650001100731700002400742700001700766700001900783700002000802700002700822700002400849773013600873856007401009852000901083655001201092IND60660983320221121152406.0190827e20150618xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066098332DNAL7 a10.1039/c5cc03019f2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGupta, Abhishek10aNitrogen-doped, thiol-functionalized carbon dots for ultrasensitive Hg(ii) detection  ap. 10750-10753.  aNitrogen-doped, PEGylated carbon dots (C-dots) have been synthesized for the detection of mercury ions (Hg²⁺).

How these two heat stress responses connect is unclear. RESULTS: Here, we show that both S. cerevisiae and D. melanogaster heat-SGs contain mRNA, translation machinery components (excluding ribosomes), and molecular chaperones and that heat-SGs coassemble with aggregates of misfolded, heat-labile proteins. Components in these mixed assemblies exhibit distinct molecular motilities reflecting differential trapping. We demonstrate that heat-SG disassembly and restoration of translation activity during heat stress recovery is intimately linked to disaggregation of damaged proteins present in the mixed assemblies and requires Hsp104 and Hsp70 activity. CONCLUSIONS: Chaperone-driven protein disaggregation directly coordinates timing of translation reinitiation with protein folding capacity during cellular protein quality surveillance, enabling efficient protein homeostasis.  aPublisher supplied data 3acytoplasmic granules 3aheat stress 3ahomeostasis 3amolecular chaperones 3amonitoring 3aprotein folding 3aproteome 3aribosomes 3astress response 3atranslation (genetics) 2aAnimals 2aDrosophila Proteinsxanalysisxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aDrosophila melanogasterxgenetics 2aGene Expression Regulation 2aHeat-Shock Responsexgenetics 2aHomeostasis 2aModels, Biological 2aMolecular Chaperonesxgeneticsxmetabolismxphysiology. 2aProtein Biosynthesis 2aProtein Folding 2aProtein Transport 2aSaccharomyces cerevisiaexgenetics 2aSaccharomyces cerevisiae Proteinsxanalysisxgeneticsxmetabolism.1 aHofmann, Sarah1 aDruffel-Augustin, Silke1 aMogk, Axel1 aTyedmers, Jens1 aStoecklin, Georg1 aBukau, Bernd0 tCurrent biology.g2013 Dec. 16, v. 23, no. 24 p.2452-2462dElsevier Inc.x0960-98227nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cub.2013.09.0583Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03018naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245017700163300001600340520166800356592002802024650002602052650000902078650002302087650001802110650001202128650001502140650002002155650001002175650001002185650001502195650000902210650001202219650001802231700001702249700002902266700001902295700001902314700002302333700002202356773010402378856008102482852000902563655001202572IND60440557420221117111116.0151024e201508  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6044055742DNAL7 a10.1007/s12550-015-0225-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPena, G.

Micro-analytical sample treatment combined with a LC-MS/MS method for gliotoxin determination  ap. 145-150.  aIn this study, gliotoxin production by Aspergillus fumigatus strains from animal environment is studied. Moreover, a rapid, easy and environment-friendly micro-analytical sample treatment procedure coupled with LC-MS/MS was applied for the determination of gliotoxin from A. fumigatus cultures. The ability of gliotoxin production by 143 strains was assayed in yeast extract sucrose agar, and 1 ml of chloroform was used for toxin extraction without further clean-up. Mean recoveries at two spiking levels (2500 and 7000 ng/g; n = 6) were 100.3 ± 6.6 % relative SD (RSD) and 92.4 ± 3.8 % RSD. Repeatability and within-laboratory reproducibility for different concentration levels of gliotoxin (25 to 1000 ng/ml; n = 12) ranged from 0.3 to 5.4 % RSD and from 3.9 to 12.7 % RSD, respectively. The detection limit of the analytical method was 3.5 ng/g. The ability for gliotoxin production by A. fumigatus revealed that 61.5 % of the strains were able to produce the toxin at levels ranging from LOQ to 3430.5 ng/g. However, all the tested samples had similar percentages of producing strains (81.8 to 86.6 %). The micro-analytical sample treatment coupled with LC-MS/MS detection is a precise and useful methodology for determining gliotoxin from fungal extracts of A. fumigatus and allows working both fast and safely and also reducing the effect on the environment. This toxin plays a critical role in the pathobiology of A. fumigatus, and its presence in animal environments could affect animal health and productivity; in addition, there are risks of contamination for rural workers during handling and storage of animal feedstuffs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAspergillus fumigatus 3aagar 3aanalytical methods 3aanimal health 3aanimals 3achloroform 3adetection limit 3afeeds 3afungi 3amycotoxins 3arisk 3asucrose 3ayeast extract1 aMonge, M.

In natural photosynthesis, water oxidation occurs in the oxygen evolving complex (OEC), a manganese-oxo cluster {Mn₄CaO₅} with a cubane-like topology that is embedded within a redox-active protein environment located in photosystem II (PS II). Therefore, the preparation of biomimetic manganese-based compounds is appealing for the development of efficient and inexpensive water oxidation catalysts. Here, we present the water oxidation catalytic activity of a high-nuclearity mixed-metal manganese-strontium cluster, [Mnᴵᴵᴵ₁₂Mnᴵᴵ₆Sr(μ₄-O₈)(μ₃-Cl)₈(HLᴹᵉ)₁₂(MeCN)₆]Cl₂∙15MeOH (Mn₁₈Sr) (HLᴹᵉ = 2,6-bis(hydroxymethyl)-p-cresol), in neutral media. This biomimetic mixed-valence cluster features different cubane-like motifs and it is stabilized by redox-active, quinone-like organic ligands. The complex displays a low onset overpotential of 192 mV and overpotentials of 284 and 550 mV at current densities of 1 mA cm⁻² and 10 mA cm⁻², respectively. Direct O₂ evolution measurements under visible light-driven water oxidation conditions demonstrate the catalytic capabilities of this cluster, which exhibits a turnover frequency of 0.48 s⁻¹ and a turnover number of 21.6. This result allows for a direct comparison to be made with the structurally analogous Mn-oxo cluster [Mnᴵᴵᴵ₁₂Mnᴵᴵ₇(µ₄-O)₈(µ₃-OCH₃)₂(µ₃-Br)₆(HLᴹᵉ)₁₂(MeOH)₅(MeCN)]Br₂·9MeCN·MeOH (Mn₁₉), the water oxidation catalytic activity of which was recently reported by us. This work highlights the potential of this series of compounds towards the water oxidation reaction and their amenability to induce structural changes that modify their reactivity.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiomimetics 3acatalytic activity 3aenergy 3aligands 3aoxidation 3aoxygen 3atopology 3awater1 aElliott, Rory 1 aKathalikkattil, Amal C.1 aAko, Ayuk M.1 aSchmitt, Wolfgang 0 tWater.g2021 July 27, v. 13, no. 15dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21688x2073-44417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w131520423Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02816naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100005800145245007700203300002000280500001900300520157100319592002801890650001301918650001201931650002601943650001501969650001101984650001301995650001802008650002902026650001102055650001502066650001602081650001302097700001702110700001902127700003002146773014202176856007902318852000902397655001202406IND60675337720221120082553.0191105e20191009xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067533772DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.est.9b030892doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSong, Xiaotong1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3831-881810aOxygen Regulates Nitrous Oxide Production Directly in Agricultural Soils  ap. 12539-12547.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aOxygen (O₂) plays a critical and yet poorly understood role in regulating nitrous oxide (N₂O) production in well-structured agricultural soils. We investigated the effects of in situ O₂ dynamics on N₂O production in a typical intensively managed Chinese cropping system under a range of environmental conditions (temperature, moisture, ammonium, nitrate, dissolved organic carbon, and so forth). Climate and management (fertilization, irrigation, precipitation, and temperature), and their interactions significantly affected soil O₂ and N₂O concentrations (P < 0.05). Soil O₂ concentration was the most significant factor correlating with soil N₂O concentration (r = −0.71) when compared with temperature, water-filled pore space, and ammonium concentration (r = 0.30, 0.25, and 0.26, respectively). Soil N₂O concentration increased exponentially with decreasing soil O₂ concentrations. The exponential model of N treatments and fertilization with irrigation/precipitation events predicted 74–90% and 58% of the variance in soil N₂O concentrations, respectively. Our results highlight that the soil O₂ status is the proximal, direct, and the most decisive environmental trigger for N₂O production, outweighing the effects of other factors and could be a key variable integrating the aggregated effects of various complex interacting variables. This study offers new opportunities for developing more sensitive approaches to predicting and through appropriate management interventions mitigating N₂O emissions from agricultural soils.  aPublisher supplied data 3aammonium 3aclimate 3aenvironmental science 3airrigation 3amodels 3anitrates 3anitrous oxide 3anitrous oxide production 3aoxygen 3atechnology 3atemperature 3avariance1 aJu, Xiaotang1 aTopp, Kairsty,1 aRees, R.

Unfortunately, cats are difficult to capture using standard trapping techniques, limiting the potential to conduct research on their ecology and impacts. Aims We present an alternative capture method: remote chemical immobilisation after tracking with trained dogs. We also compare capture rates to a concurrent soft-jaw leg-hold trapping program. Methods We used dogs to capture cats detected by spotlighting at night, and also recaptured cats fitted with telemetry collars during the day. Cats were either bailed on the ground or treed and then hand-netted, or chemically immobilised using darts shot from a CO2-powered dart rifle, loaded with tiletamine–zolazepam at ~6mgkg-1. Factors affecting the success rate of capturing cats using dogs were assessed. Efficiency in terms of cats captured per person-hours of fieldwork were compared using trained dogs versus leg-hold trapping. Key results We attempted 160 cat captures using the tracking dogs with 114 of those being successful. There were no mortalities or debilitating physical injuries associated with chemical immobilisation; however, sedated cats had prolonged recoveries (>4h). Capture success with the tracking dogs increased as the dogs gained experience. Capture success rates per person-hour of fieldwork were four times greater using spotlighting with tracking dogs than using leg-hold traps. The success rate of recaptures using dogs was 97%. Conclusions The use of trained tracking dogs proved an effective method for capturing feral cats. The method had a much higher success rate than live-trapping with leg-hold traps, took less effort (in terms of person-hours) and caused less physical injuries than did leg-hold traps. However, substantial setup costs and time are required, which are discussed. Implications Using these methods could improve efficiency and outcomes when catching feral cats, and enable more data per individual cat to be collected than otherwise.  aPublisher supplied data 3acats 3acollars 3adogs 3aferal animals 3aindigenous species 3amortality 3apredation 3atelemetry 3atrapping 3atraps 3awildlife1 aHampton, Jordan O.1 aLisle, Danielle1 aLegge, Sarah0 tWildlife research.g2016, v. 43, no. 4 p.313-322dCSIRO Publishingx1035-37127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1071/WR151343Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03760naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100002300138245010900161300001600270520224800286592002802534650001802562650001202580650002702592650001202619650001202631650001402643650001302657650001102670650001602681650000902697650001302706650001002719650000902729650001202738650002802750650001102778650002702789650001002816650001802826650002302844650001402867650001502881650000902896651001802905700002002923700002102943700003202964773014102996856007203137852000903209655001203218IND60661868220221119094829.0190904e20040511xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066186822DNAL7 a10.1039/b315640k2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNorton, Stephen A.10aPaleolimnological assessment of Grove and Plow Shop Ponds, Ayer, Massachusetts, USA – A superfund site  ap. 457-465.  aThree sediment cores from each of severely polluted Grove and Plow Shop Ponds, Ayer, Massachusetts, USA, were dated using ²¹⁰Pb, characterized for plant macrofossil assemblages, and analyzed for H₂O, loss-on-ignition, stable Pb isotopes, and concentrations of As, Ca, Cd, Cr, Cu, Fe, Hg, methyl-Hg, Ni, Pb, and Zn. A core from nearby kettle Spectacle Pond, Littleton, Massachusetts, was similarly characterized (except for plant macrofossil assemblages) to assess the regional air pollution signal in sediment for comparison with the six cores. Accumulation rates for metals (mass per area per year), the anthropogenic component (mass per area per year), and total accumulation of the anthropogenic component (mass per area) indicate that As, Cd, Cr, Cu, Hg, methyl-Hg, Ni, Pb, and Zn have accumulated in sediment as a consequence of point source pollution from within the drainage basins of Grove and Plow Shop Ponds. Three distinct sources of pollution are inferred. As is entering Plow Shop Pond via groundwater in the southwest. Cd, Ni, Pb, and Zn are entering the system predominantly at the eastern end of, or upstream from, Grove Pond. Pb also comes from the northwest corner of Grove Pond, the principal source of Cr, Cu, and Hg. These results are consistent with chemistry of modern surface sediments. The history of pollution extends back more than 100 years. Intra- and inter-core variability of concentrations and accumulation rates indicate that much of the pollution was likely in particulate form with little physical redistribution. Recently, concentrations and accumulation rates have generally decreased substantially for those elements present in excessive concentrations in the past. This is a consequence of accumulation of recent, less polluted sediment. In Spectacle Pond, the nearby reference lake, accumulation rates for As, Cd, Hg, and Pb, adjusted for background values and changes in sedimentation rate, increased above background starting in the late 19th century, peaked about 1980, and declined substantially to 2000. These decreases suggest that the anthropogenic (pollution) component of atmospheric deposition of these elements declined after 1980 by at least 50% (As), 80% (Cd), 80% (Hg), and 80% (Pb).  aPublisher supplied data 3aair pollution 3aarsenic 3aatmospheric deposition 3acadmium 3acalcium 3achemistry 3achromium 3acopper 3agroundwater 3airon 3aisotopes 3alakes 3alead 3amercury 3amethylmercury compounds 3anickel 3apoint source pollution 3aponds 3aradionuclides 3asedimentation rate 3asediments 3awatersheds 3azinc 3aMassachusetts1 aPerry, Ethan R.1 aHaines, Terry A.1 aDieffenbacher-Krall, Ann C.0 tJournal of environmental monitoring.g2004 May 11, v. 6, no. 5 p.457-465dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:27191x1464-03337nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/b315640k3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01875naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006400148245008900212300001600301520084600317592002801163650002501191650001201216650001801228650001301246650001801259651001101277651001501288700002101303700002101324773011301345856008201458852000901540655001201549IND60645685720221119162423.0190529e201904  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064568572DNAL7 a10.1007/s12571-019-00898-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMilhorance, Carolina1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3290-859614aThe politics of the internationalisation of Brazil’s ‘Zero Hunger’ instruments  ap. 447-460.  aBrazil became a prominent player for policy dialogue on food security and social protection in the 2000s and started to share its policy instruments with developing countries.

It shows that despite political and institutional constraints at the national level to adopting the initiatives in Mozambique, local actors managed to adapt them to their contexts. It aims to contribute to recent policy transfer literature, which is particularly interested in the role of ‘translation’ mechanisms in the circulation of policy ideas and practices across nations.  aPublisher supplied data 3adeveloping countries 3afarmers 3afood security 3apolitics 3apublic policy 3aBrazil 3aMozambique1 aBursztyn, Marcel1 aSabourin, Éric,0 tFood security.g2019 Apr., v. 11, no. 2 p.447-460dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:J000000074x1876-45177nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12571-019-00898-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02408naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100003300149245004900182300001600231520103200247592002801279650002101307650002001328650001401348650001001362650002001372650001701392650001401409650001501423650001901438650001301457650002701470650000901497650001201506650001001518651000901528653001501537653001801552653001401570653001401584700002201598700002001620700002801640700001701668773013701685856008301822852000901905655001201914IND60555201920221120074044.0161026e201506  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055520192DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apjtb.2015.02.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlizadeh Otaghvar, Hamidreza12aA review on metastatic breast cancer in Iran  ap. 429-433.  aMetastatic breast cancer is a disease of early breast cancer that usually occurs several years after the early breast cancer. Breast cancer is the most common cancer among Iranian women. According to the new statistics in Iran 6160 breast cancers are diagnosed in the country each year and 1063 cases lead to death. In this paper, epidemiology, diagnosis and treatment have been investigated. In this study, case–control clinical trials and open studies with adequate data were collected. Due to the higher risk of age group 40–49 years and the advent of advanced breast cancer in Iranian women, the early diagnosis and determination of the exact size of the tumor before surgery is important in choosing a therapy plan. The decision on the therapy of invasive breast cancer depends on several factors such as cancer stage, tumor size and type, pathological and cytological status of the tumor, the patient's opinion, the presence or absence of estrogen and progesterone receptors in the cytoplasm of tumor cells and so on.  aPublisher supplied data 3abreast neoplasms 3aclinical trials 3acytoplasm 3adeath 3aearly diagnosis 3aepidemiology 3aestrogens 3ametastasis 3aneoplasm cells 3apatients 3aprogesterone receptors 3arisk 3asurgery 3awomen 3aIran 0aMetastatic 0aBreast cancer 0aDiagnosis 0aTreatment1 aHosseini, Mostafa1 aTizmaghz, Adnan1 aShabestanipour, Ghazaal1 aNoori, Hamid0 tAsian Pacific Journal of Tropical Biomedicine.g2015 June, v. 5 p.429-433dElsevier B.V.aHainan Medical Universityx2221-16917nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apjtb.2015.02.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03848naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100002000137245007900157300001600236520228700252592002802539650002702567650001302594650001102607650001102618650001202629650001502641650002402656650001502680650002602695650001202721650001202733650001502745650001302760650002302773650002202796650001702818650001002835650002502845650001202870650001802882650002502900651001102925651001202936653002702948653001502975653002002990653002603010653002203036653002203058700002203080773008803102856007103190852000903261655001203270IND60524287420221119171501.0160706s2016    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052428742DNAL7 a10.1071/WR151472doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLitt, Andrea R.10aComplex demographic responses of a common small mammal to a plant invasion  ap. 304-312.  aContext Invasions by non-native plants can alter the abundance and distribution of resources that can affect habitat quality for native animals. Aims We sought to understand the demographic consequences of a plant invasion on a functionally and numerically important rodent in a grassland ecosystem. Specifically, we evaluated how abundance, survival, reproductive activity and population structure of Arizona cotton rats (Sigmodon arizonae) varied across a gradient of invasion by Eragrostis lehmanniana (Lehmann lovegrass), a bunchgrass native to Africa that has invaded grasslands in North America. Methods Over a four-year period, we used capture–recapture methods to survey small mammals on 54 1-ha plots between 10 and 13 times. We used vegetation data collected each autumn to quantify biomass of non-native grass, total biomass and vegetation heterogeneity to characterise vegetation structure on each plot. Key results We captured 1344 individual cotton rats during 106560 trap-nights across all sampling periods. In areas dominated by non-native grass, abundance of cotton rats increased 7- to 10-fold and survival increased by 117% relative to areas dominated by native grasses. In contrast, reproductive activity of adults decreased by 62% for females and 28% for males, and the proportion of adults in the population decreased by 20% in these same areas. Conclusions Demography of Arizona cotton rats differed markedly in areas invaded by a non-native plant relative to native grasslands, supporting the long-held idea that life histories can reflect local environmental conditions. Because distributions of many non-native plants are predicted to increase in response to future changes in natural and anthropogenic drivers, the potential breadth of these complex effects on communities of native animal is immense. Implications The complex variation in demographic responses across the invasion gradient suggests that it may be necessary to evaluate a suite of vital rates to fully understand the consequences of plant invasions on animals.

Going further, this paper draws on wider food systems literature, and includes food price and expenditure data, to join the dots from macroeconomic and food system change to food sources, production, and price; to household-level expenditures; to changing diets and nutrition and health outcomes, illustrated through the case of Zambia. Many of the economic and demographic drivers of the nutrition transition are present in Zambia, including rising GDP, high urbanization and increasing supermarket penetration. Food supply data show a reduction in calories available per capita over several decades, and low levels of nutrient-rich plant and animal source foods which make up a diverse, nutritious diet. National food price data show that while the cost of food has reduced overall, nutrient-rich foods are more expensive relative to staple foods over time. Expenditure on staple foods has reduced in the past two decades while spending on fruits and vegetables, animal source foods, fats and sugars, and processed foods has increased, with these change greater in rural areas in recent years, but already more advanced in urban areas. Finally, while undernutrition is reducing slowly from very high levels and hunger persists, overweight and obesity and non-communicable chronic diseases are increasing; and data are strikingly lacking on modern Zambian diets. The Zambia case study is placed within regional and global trends to illustrate nutrition transition changes that are now happening in rapidly changing lower-middle income countries. Policy responses include promoting the availability of diverse nutrient-dense foods, and concurrent attention to preventing under- and over-nutrition in surveillance and policy. This paper also sheds light on the gaps in information that would greatly improve our understanding of the food system drivers of the nutrition transition, and hence our ability to create relevant policy.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal-based foods 3acase studies 3achronic diseases 3adiet 3afood availability 3afood prices 3afruits 3ahousehold consumption 3ahunger 3aincome 3aissues and policy 3alipids 3amacroeconomics 3amalnutrition 3amonitoring 3aobesity 3aprocessed foods 3arural areas 3astaple foods 3asugars 3asupermarkets 3aurban areas 3aurbanization 3avegetables 3aZambia1 aChisanga, Brian1 aDrimie, Scott1 aKennedy, Gina0 tFood security.g2019 Apr., v. 11, no. 2 p.371-387dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:J000000074x1876-45177nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12571-019-00903-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03167naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002300164245009800187300001400285520159700299592002801896650002301924650001201947650000901959650001401968650001001982650001501992650001402007650002402021650002202045650001602067650001202083650002202095650001202117650004702129650003802176650003302214650006402247650001102311650002402322650004702346651001202393651001202405700001802417700002702435700002102462773009702483856004802580852000902628655001202637IND4475213320221120185742.0120530e201207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447521332DNAL7 a225435812pmid7 a10.1007/s00267-012-9868-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLarocque, Sarah M.10aAccidental Bait: Do Deceased Fish Increase Freshwater Turtle Bycatch in Commercial Fyke Nets?  ap. 31-38.  aBycatch of turtles in passive inland fyke net fisheries has been poorly studied, yet bycatch is an important conservation issue given the decline in many freshwater turtle populations. Delayed maturity and low natural adult mortality make turtles particularly susceptible to population declines when faced with additional anthropogenic adult mortality such as bycatch. When turtles are captured in fyke nets, the prolonged submergence can lead to stress and subsequent drowning. Fish die within infrequently checked passive fishing nets and dead fish are a potential food source for many freshwater turtles. Dead fish could thus act as attractants and increase turtle captures in fishing nets. We investigated the attraction of turtles to decomposing fish within fyke nets in eastern Ontario. We set fyke nets with either 1 kg of one-day or five-day decomposed fish, or no decomposed fish in the cod-end of the net. Decomposing fish did not alter the capture rate of turtles or fish, nor did it alter the species composition of the catch. Thus, reducing fish mortality in nets using shorter soak times is unlikely to alter turtle bycatch rates since turtles were not attracted by the dead fish. Interestingly, turtle bycatch rates increased as water temperatures did. Water temperature also influences turtle mortality by affecting the duration turtles can remain submerged. We thus suggest that submerged nets to either not be set or have reduced soak times in warm water conditions (e.g., >20 °C) as turtles tend to be captured more frequently and cannot withstand prolonged submergence.  aPublisher supplied data 3aat-risk population 3abycatch 3afish 3afish nets 3afoods 3afreshwater 3amortality 3apopulation dynamics 3aspecies diversity 3asubmergence 3aturtles 3awater temperature 2aAnimals 2aConservation of Natural Resourcesxmethods 2aEnvironmental Monitoringxmethods 2aFeeding Behaviorxphysiology 2aFisheriesxmethodsxstandardsxstatistics & numerical data. 2aFishes 2aPopulation Dynamics 2aTurtlesxgrowth & developmentxphysiology. 3aOntario 0aOntario1 aWatson, Paige1 aBlouin-Demers, Gabriel1 aCooke, Steven J.0 tEnvironmental management.g2012 July, v. 50, no. 1 p.31-38dSpringer-Verlagx0364-152X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00267-012-9868-8  aDNAL 7aarticle03091naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002600111040001800137072001700155072001700172072001700189100002200206245011900228300001600347520156800363650002001931650001401951650002801965650001601993650001802009650002702027650001702054650002102071650002802092650001202120650003902132650003402171650002702205650002502232650001602257700001602273700002302289700002102312773009602333852000902429856007602438930003302514945002502547946001302572655001202585IND4416474320221119215122.0090218e200901  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441647432DNAL7 a187176182pmid7 a10.1897/08-143.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aWeston, Donald P.10aWhole sediment toxicity identification evaluation tools for pyrethroid insecticides. III. Temperature manipulation  ap. 173-180.  aSince the toxicity of pyrethroid insecticides is known to increase at low temperatures, the use of temperature manipulation was explored as a whole-sediment toxicity identification evaluation (TIE) tool to help identify sediment samples in which pyrethroid insecticides are responsible for observed toxicity. The amphipod Hyalella azteca is commonly used for toxicity testing of sediments at a 23°C test temperature. However, a temperature reduction to 18°C doubled the toxicity of pyrethroids, and a further reduction to 13°C tripled their toxicity. A similar response, though less dramatic, was found for 1,1-bis(p-chlorophenyl)-2,2,2-trichloroethane (DDT), and dissimilar temperature responses were seen for cadmium and the insecticide chlorpyrifos. Tests with field-collected sediments containing pyrethroids and/or chlorpyrifos showed the expected thermal dependency in nearly all instances. The inverse relationship between temperature and toxicity provides a simple approach to help establish when pyrethroids are the principal toxicant in a sediment sample that could be used as a supplemental tool in concert with chemical analysis or other TIE manipulations. The phenomenon appears to be, in part, a consequence of a reduced ability to biotransform the toxic parent compound at cooler temperatures. The strong dependence of pyrethroid toxicity on temperature has important ramifications for predicting their environmental effects, and the standard test temperature of 23°C dramatically underestimates risk to resident fauna during the cooler months. 3aHyalella azteca 3asediments 3apyrethroid insecticides 3atemperature 3aecotoxicology 3asediment contamination 3achlorpyrifos 3atoxicity testing 2aAmphipodaxdrug effects 2aAnimals 2aEnvironmental Pollutantsxtoxicity 2aGeologic Sedimentsxchemistry 2aInsecticidesxtoxicity 2aPyrethrinsxtoxicity 2aTemperature1 aYau, Ching.1 aHarwood, Amanda D.1 aLydy, Michael J.0 tEnvironmental toxicology and chemistry.g2009 Jan., v. 28, no. 1 p.173-180x0730-72687nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1897/08-143.13Available from publisher's Web site  a20100319b20100403c00000000  aINDdYLPe2010/03/19  aOther US 7aarticle03225naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002100111024003200132040001800164100001400182245009600196300001800292506007600310520155700386506003701943650002201980650002902002650001702031650001702048650002702065650001302092650002902105650001802134650002702152650003402179650004602213650002202259650002002281650003402301650004102335650002602376653001202402700001402414773014102428852000902569856008202578930003302660945001302693946001302706655001202719IND2327382020221207082553.0020604e20020305dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232738202DNAL7 a118806312pmid7 aPMC1224282pmcid7 a10.1073/pnas.0527046992doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLange, C.10aCrystal structure of the yeast cytochrome bc1 complex with its bound substrate cytochrome c  ap. 2800-2805.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aSmall diffusible redox proteins facilitate electron transfer in respiration and photosynthesis by alternately binding to integral membrane proteins. Specific and transient complexes need to be formed between the redox partners to ensure fast turnover. In respiration, the mobile electron carrier cytochrome c shuttles electrons from the cytochrome bc1 complex to cytochrome c oxidase. Despite extensive studies of this fundamental step of energy metabolism, the structures of the respective electron transfer complexes were not known. Here we present the crystal structure of the complex between cytochrome c and the cytochrome bc1 complex from Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The complex was crystallized with the help of an antibody fragment, and its structure was determined at 2.97-angstrom resolution. Cytochrome c is bound to subunit cytochrome c1 of the enzyme. The tight and specific interactions critical for electron transfer are mediated mainly by nonpolar forces. The close spatial arrangement of the c-type hemes unexpectedly suggests a direct and rapid heme-to-heme electron transfer at a calculated rate of up to 8.3 x 10(6) s(-1). Remarkably, cytochrome c binds to only one recognition site of the homodimeric multisubunit complex. Interestingly, the occupancy of quinone in the Qi site is higher in the monomer with bound cytochrome c, suggesting a coordinated binding and reduction of both electron-accepting substrates. Obviously, cytochrome c reduction by the cytochrome bc1 complex can be regulated in response to respiratory conditions.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aX-ray diffraction 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3acytochrome b 3acytochrome c 3amolecular conformation 3acrystals 2aBenzoquinonesxchemistry 2aBinding Sites 2aCrystallography, X-Ray 2aCytochrome c Groupxchemistry 2aElectron Transport Complex IIIxchemistry 2aModels, Molecular 2aProtein Binding 2aProtein Structure, Quaternary 2aSaccharomyces cerevisiaexenzymology 2aSubstrate Specificity 0abinding1 aHunte, C.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2002 Mar. 5, v. 99, no. 5 p.2800-2805x0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.0527046993Available from publisher's Web site  a20020630b20020705c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US 7aarticle03316naa a2200625 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002100111024003200132040001800164100001900182245015700201300001800358506007600376520104100452506003701493650002801530650002601558650002101584650001801605650001401623650002501637650001201662650001401674650002001688650004601708650001201754650002501766650002601791650006101817650004801878650002401926650006301950650004302013650004402056650001402100650004802114650005502162650004402217653001402261653001402275653003002289653003302319700001802352700001702370773014102387852000902528856008202537930003302619945001302652946001302665655001202678IND2327382220221207082554.0020604e20020305dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232738222DNAL7 a118544602pmid7 aPMC1224442pmcid7 a10.1073/pnas.0525097992doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBantignies, F.14aThe interaction between the coactivator dCBP and Modulo, a chromatin-associated factor, affects segmentation and melanotic tumor formation in Drosophila  ap. 2895-2900.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe development of Drosophila requires the function of the CREB-binding protein, dCBP. In flies, dCBP serves as a coactivator for the transcription factors Cubitus interruptus, Dorsal, and Mad, and as a cosuppressor of Drosophila T cell factor. Current models propose that CBP, through its intrinsic and associated histone acetyltransferase activities, affects transient chromatin changes that allow the preinitiation complex to access the promoter. In this report, we provide evidence that dCBP may regulate the formation of chromatin states through interactions with the modulo (mod) gene product, a protein that is thought to be involved in chromatin packaging. We demonstrate that dCBP and Modulo bind in vitro and in vivo, that mutations in mod enhance the embryonic phenotype of a dCBP mutation, and that dCBP mutations enhance the melanotic tumor phenotype characteristic of mod homozygous mutants. These results imply that, in addition to its histone acetyltransferase activity, dCBP may affect higher-order chromatin structure.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDrosophila melanogaster 3atranscription factors 3aacyltransferases 3aembryogenesis 3achromatin 3apolytene chromosomes 3amutants 3aneoplasms 3aembryo (animal) 2aAcetyltransferasesxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aAnimals 2aCREB-Binding Protein 2aChromatinxmetabolism 2aChromosomal Proteins, Non-Histonexgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aDNA-Binding Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aDrosophila Proteins 2aDrosophila melanogasterxembryologyxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aInsect Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aNuclear Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aPhenotype 2aRNA-Binding Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aRecombinant Fusion Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aTrans-Activatorsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 0amelanosis 0astructure 0ahistone acetyltransferase 0atranscriptional coactivators1 aGoodman, R.H.1 aSmolik, S.M.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2002 Mar. 5, v. 99, no. 5 p.2895-2900x0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.0525097993Available from publisher's Web site  a20020630b20020705c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US 7aarticle02484naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127072001700145100002100162245012300183300001600306500001500322520096400337650002501301650002801326650001201354650003701366650001801403650002301421650001401444650001901458650002001477650004401497650002201541650000901563650001101572650001601583650002001599653002401619700001801643700001901661700002001680700001901700773009401719852000901813856008501822930003301907945002501940946001301965655001201978IND4416476520221119215340.0090218e200810  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441647652DNAL7 a10.1080/027738108024851392doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Both DRIFTS and XPS showed high variability in fiber surface composition between species and between fiber types (sapwood, heartwood, and bark). Fiber surface was modified by esterification reaction using a maleic anhydride polyethylene (MAPE) treatment. DRIFTS failed to assess surface modification, whereas XPS results showed that MAPE treatment increased the surface hydrocarbon concentration of jack pine wood fiber, indicated by a decrease in oxygen-carbon ratio and an increase in relative intensity of the C1 component in the C1s signal. Lignin concentration variability on the fiber surface was determined as the major factor that prevents esterification from taking place. 3achemical composition 3ainterspecific variation 3asapwood 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3aPicea mariana 3aThuja occidentalis 3aheartwood 3aesterification 3aPinus banksiana 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aspectral analysis 3abark 3alignin 3awood fibers 3asurface quality 0aspecies differences1 aKoubaa, Ahmed1 aPerre, Patrick1 aCloutier, Alain1 aRiedl, Bernard0 tJournal of wood chemistry and technology.g2008 , v. 28, no. 4 p.296-315x0277-38137nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/027738108024851393Available from publisher's Web site  a20090220b20090301c00000000  aINDdLYNe2009/02/20  aOther US 7aarticle02687naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002100110040001800131100001600149245010400165300001800269300002300287500001500310520137400325650002001699650002001719650002101739650001201760650001501772650002401787650004001811650002201851650003401873650003601907650001301943650004101956650004701997650001702044653002702061700001402088773008402102852000902186939003302195946001302228655001202241IND8803781320221119215319.0880902e198808  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND880378132DNAL7 a34035052pmid7 aPMC2112982pmcid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLeigh, J.A.10aCharacterization of polysaccharides of Rhizobium meliloti exo mutants that form ineffective nodules  ap. 3327-3332.  ap. 3327-3332. ill.  a2019-12-05  aMutants of Rhizobium meliloti SU47 with defects in the production of the Calcofluor-binding exopolysaccharide succinoglycan failed to gain entry into alfalfa root nodules. In order to define better the polysaccharide phenotypes of these exo mutants, we analyzed the periplasmic oligosaccharide cyclic (1-2)-beta-D-glucan and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in representative mutants. The exoC mutant lacked the glucan and had abnormal LPS which appeared to lack a substantial portion of the 0 side chain. The exoB mutant had a spectrum of LPS species which differed from those of both the wild-type parental strain and the exoC mutant. The presence of the glucan and normal LPS in the exoA, exoD, exoF, and exoH mutants eliminated defects in these carbohydrates as explanations for the nodule entry defects of these mutants. We also assayed for high- and low-molecular-weight succinoglycans. All of the exo mutants except exoD and exoH completely lacked both forms. For the Calcofluor-dim exoD mutant, the distribution of high- and low-molecular-weight forms depended on the growth medium. The haloless exoH mutant produced high-molecular-weight and only a trace of low-molecular-weight succinoglycan; the succinyl modification was missing, as was expected from the results of previous studies. The implications of these observations with regard to nodule entry are discussed. 3apolysaccharides 3aMedicago sativa 3aEnsifer meliloti 3amutants 3anodulation 2aChromatography, Gel 2aElectrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel 2aGlucansxanalysis 2aLipopolysaccharidesxanalysis 2aMagnetic Resonance Spectroscopy 2aMutation 2aPolysaccharides, Bacterialxanalysis 2aRhizobiumxanalysisxgeneticsxphysiology. 2abeta-Glucans 0aSinorhizobium meliloti1 aLee, C.C.0 tJournal of bacteriology.g1988 Aug., v. 170, no. 8 p.3327-3332x0021-91937nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19880902c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02541naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100002500154245006300179300001600242520157300258650001201831650001401843650000901857650001301866650001101879650001401890650002501904650001001929650001201939700001901951773018101970856005502151852000902206655001202215IND60620237920221119215152.0181107s2003    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062023792DNAL7 a10.1046/j.1095-8312.2003.00211.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStephens, Patrick R.10aEcological diversification and phylogeny of emydid turtles  ap. 577-610.  aEcological diversification is a central topic in ecology and evolutionary biology. We undertook the first comprehensive species-level phylogenetic analysis of Emydidae (an ecologically diverse group of turtles), and used the resulting phylogeny to test four general hypotheses about ecological diversification. Phylogenetic analyses were based on data from morphology (237 parsimony-informative characters) and mitochondrial DNA sequences (547 parsimony-informative characters) and included 39 of the 40 currently recognized emydid species. Combined analyses of all data provide a well-supported hypothesis for intergeneric relationships, and support monophyly of the two subfamilies (Emydinae and Deirochelyinae) and most genera (with the notable exception of Clemmys and Trachemys). Habitat and diet were mapped onto the combined-data tree to test fundamental hypotheses about ecological diversification. Using continuous coding of ecological characters showed that lineages changed in habitat before diet, ecological change was most frequently from generalist to specialist, and habitat and diet rarely changed on the same branch of the phylogeny. However, we also demonstrate that the results of ancestral trait reconstructions can be highly sensitive to character coding method (i.e. continuous vs. discrete). Finally, we propose a simple model to describe the pattern of ecological diversification in emydid turtles and other lineages, which may reconcile the (seemingly) conflicting conclusions of our study and two recent reviews of ecological diversification. 3aClemmys 3aTrachemys 3adiet 3ahabitats 3amodels 3amonophyly 3anucleotide sequences 3atrees 3aturtles1 aWiens, John J.0 tBiological journal of the Linnean Society.g2003 Aug., v. 79, no. 4 p.577-610dPublished for the Linnean Society of London by Blackwell [etc.]wJournal:jnl1847x0024-40667nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1095-8312.2003.00211.x  aDNAL 7aarticle02741naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127072000900145072000900154072000900163072000900172072000900181100001500190245006100205300001600266500002400282500001500306520128100321650002501602650001601627650001301643650002101656650001901677650001401696650002101710650003601731650000901767650001001776650002401786650001101810650000901821653001901830653002701849653002501876700002001901700001401921773010101935852000902036856008502045930003302130945002502163946001102188655001202199IND4393425220221119215116.0070723e20070613xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439342522DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jep.2007.02.0242doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF600 0aS200 0aX380 0aL840 0aF0001 aWahida, B.10aAntiulcerogenic activity of Zizyphus lotus (L.) extracts  ap. 228-231.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aOral administration of aqueous extracts of Zizyphus lotus root barks (50-200 mg/kg) leaves (50-200 mg/kg) and fruits (200-400 mg/kg) produced a significant (p < 0.01) and dose dependent inhibition to the acute ulcer induced by HCl/ethanol solution. The methanolic (MeOH), ethyl acetate (EtOAc) and chloroformic (CHCl3) leaves extracts when administered orally at the dose of 200 mg/kg, exhibited a significant (p < 0.01) inhibition of gastric lesions by 45%, 76% and 33%, respectively. Indeed, methanolic and ethyl acetate root barks extracts significantly reduced the gastric lesions by 47% and 41%, respectively. While the chloroformic root barks extract had no significant activity (19%). The effect of all extracts was compared with cimetidine (100 mg/kg, 62%) and omeprazole (30 mg/kg, 93%). Volume, pH and acidity of gastric juice were studied in pylorus-ligated rats. Root barks (200 mg/kg, p < 0.01), leaves (200 mg/kg, p < 0.01) and fruits (400 mg/kg, p < 0.05) aqueous extracts showed significant reduction of gastric juice secretion in pylorus ligated rats, whereas the other extracts did not show any significance. Thus, Zizyphus lotus extracts act essentially as cytoprotective agents, which support the antiulcer effect of this plant in the traditional medicine. 3atraditional medicine 3aethnobotany 3aZiziphus 3amedicinal plants 3aplant extracts 3abioassays 3aherbal medicines 3achemical constituents of plants 3abark 3aroots 3aanti-ulcer activity 3aleaves 3arats 0aZiziphus lotus 0afruits (plant anatomy) 0amedicinal properties1 aAbderrahman, B.1 aNabil, C.0 tJournal of ethnopharmacology.g2007 June 13, v. 112, no. 2 p.228-231dElsevier.x0378-87417nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jep.2007.02.0243Available from publisher's Web site  a20070725b20070802c00000000  aINDdMKSe2007/07/25  aNon-US 7aarticle03432naa a2200661 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127072000900145072000900154072000900163072000900172100002500181245014500206300001400351500002400365500001500389520151900404650002201923650002501945650002101970650001101991650001802002650001202020650001802032650001502050650001302065650002602078650002002104650001402124650001802138650001402156650002402170650001502194650001702209650001802226650001602244650001802260650001902278650001502297650002602312650002202338651001202360653001602372653002102388700002002409700001702429700002802446773012102474852000902595856008502604930003302689945002502722946001102747655001202758IND4393263020140724000000.0070722e200707  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439326302DNAL7 a10.1007/s11240-007-9251-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF600 0aF200 0aF400 0aF1201 aRákosy-Tican, Elena10aIn vitro morphogenesis of sunflower (Helianthus annuus) hypocotyl protoplasts: the effects of protoplast density, haemoglobin and spermidine  ap. 55-62.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aSunflower, as one of the most important oil-producing crops, represents an important target for genetic improvement through gene transfer or somatic hybridization. Unfortunately, sunflower is recognized as recalcitrant to in vitro culture. The aim of our paper was to improve sunflower protoplast regeneration. Three cultivars (Romanian hybrids) and one inbred line were used for protoplast isolation from etiolated hypocotyls. Isolated protoplasts were embedded in alginate disks and cultured in two plating densities, using two culture regimes as indicated by previous authors. Plating efficiency, callus development and plant regeneration were evaluated as well as old callus histology. In cv. 'Select', the effects of 1:50 haemoglobin and 1 mM spermidine were assayed on asymmetric division and/or plating efficiency. Plant regeneration from hypocotyl protoplasts was achieved for two cvs., 'Florom 328' and 'Turbo', with the former proving once more its totipotency. The best culture regime proved to be as recommended by Krasnyanski and Menczel (1993), but the best density in the culture medium was the highest ever tested, 8 x 10⁵ pp ml-¹. Moreover, the histology of old green compact protoplast-derived callus revealed a very well organized structure suggesting senescence. In the non-responsive cv. 'Select', haemoglobin was found to stimulate protoplast asymmetric division and the development of heart-shaped embryo-like structures, while spermidine stimulated overall protoplast plating efficiency. 3aHelianthus annuus 3adevelopmental stages 3amicropropagation 3acallus 3asunflower oil 3ahybrids 3adose response 3ahypocotyls 3aexplants 3ain vitro regeneration 3asomatic embryos 3acultivars 3amorphogenesis 3ahistology 3agenetic improvement 3aspermidine 3ainbred lines 3aculture media 3aprotoplasts 3agene transfer 3aplant breeding 3ahemoglobin 3asomatic embryogenesis 3agenetic variation 3aRomania 0amethodology 0ain vitro culture1 aAurori, Adriana1 aVesa, Simona1 aKovacs, Krisztina-Maria0 tPlant cell, tissue, and organ culture.g2007 July, v. 90, no. 1 p.55-62dKluwer Academic Publishersx0167-68577nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11240-007-9251-23Available from publisher's Web site  a20071022b20071102c00000000  aINDdMKSe2007/10/22  aNon-US 7aarticle03068naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100002100154245015700175300001600332520185600348650001102204650002202215650001202237650001402249650001702263650001202280650001402292650001902306650001502325650000902340650002202349650001402371650001602385650002502401651001102426773018102437856005502618852000902673655001202682IND60620238320221119215153.0181107s2003    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062023832DNAL7 a10.1046/j.1095-8312.2003.00214.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDrotz, Marcus K.10aSpeciation and mitochondrial DNA diversification of the diving beetles Agabus bipustulatus and A. wollastoni (Coleoptera, Dytiscidae) within Macaronesia  ap. 653-666.  aDiversification of populations of two morphologically similar diving beetles within the Agabus tristis group, A. wollastoni and A. bipustulatus, was investigated, with partial mtDNA cytochrome b (Cyt b) sequences, allozymes and landmark-based morphometrics. The Madeiran endemic A. wollastoni was collected from 11 localities. Population genetic and morphological variation was compared to Scandinavian localities of the widespread west Palearctic A. bipustulatus, recorded also from the Azores. Agabus wollastoni and European A. bipustulatus specimens representing eight and 13 localities respectively, were used in evaluating their phylogenetic relationship. Maximum parsimony analysis of the Cyt b sequences showed that both the A. bipustulatus and A. wollastoni specimens form well-supported monophyletic groups. Three lines of evidence suggest that Agabus wollastoni has speciated through a few founders: (1) a well-supported mtDNA line; (2) the mean heterozygosity of A. wollastoni is lower when compared to A. bipustulatus on the mainland; and (3) several uncommon alleles of A. bipustulatus are missing in A. wollastoni. The Azorean A. bipustulatus population was drastically affected by the colonization event, since several loci have become fixed with a resulting lower mean heterozygosity. The colonization was relatively recent, as the mtDNA lineage represented in the Azores is deeply nested within the A. bipustulatus clade. Population structure shows moderate inbreeding of A. wollastoni, and extensive substructuring at all localities with moderate gene-flow between them. Morphological variation in A. wollastoni showed significant differentiation among several populations. Island colonizations, population structure of A. wollastoni, and an observed pattern of variation of the α-glycerophosphate dehydrogenase locus are discussed. 3aAgabus 3aPalearctic region 3aalleles 3aallozymes 3acytochrome b 3aenzymes 3agene flow 3aheterozygosity 3ainbreeding 3aloci 3amitochondrial DNA 3amonophyly 3amorphometry 3apopulation structure 3aAzores0 tBiological journal of the Linnean Society.g2003 Aug., v. 79, no. 4 p.653-666dPublished for the Linnean Society of London by Blackwell [etc.]wJournal:jnl1847x0024-40667nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1095-8312.2003.00214.x  aDNAL 7aarticle02760naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100002200154245012200176300001600298520151500314650000801829650001501837650001201852650001401864650002301878650001001901650001401911650001801925650002001943650001401963650002701977650001102004650001302015650002202028650002002050651001402070700002102084773018102105856005502286852000902341655001202350IND60620238820221119215105.0181107s2003    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062023882DNAL7 a10.1046/j.1095-8312.2003.00199.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBittner, Tonya D.10aGene flow and melanism in garter snakes revisited: a comparison of molecular markers and island vs. coalescent models  ap. 389-399.  aWithin populations, the stochastic effect of genetic drift and deterministic effect of natural selection are potentially weakened or altered by gene flow among populations. The influence of gene flow on Lake Erie populations of the common garter snake has been of particular interest because of a discontinuous colour pattern polymorphism (striped vs. melanistic) that is a target of natural selection. We reassessed the relative contributions of gene flow and genetic drift using genetic data and population size estimates. We compared all combinations of two marker systems and two analytical approaches to the estimation of gene flow rates: allozymes (data previously published), microsatellite DNA (new data), the island model (F(ST)-based approach), and a coalescence-based approach. For the coalescence approach, mutation rates and sampling effects were also investigated. While the two markers produced similar results, gene flow based on F(ST) was considerably higher (Nm > 4) than that from the coalescence-based method (Nm < 1). Estimates of gene flow are likely to be inflated by lack of migration-drift equilibrium and changing population size. Potentially low rates of gene flow (Nm < 1), small population size at some sites, and positive correlations of number of microsatellite DNA alleles and island size and between M, mean ratio of number of alleles to range in allele size, and island size suggest that in addition to selection, random genetic drift may influence colour pattern frequencies. 3aDNA 3aThamnophis 3aalleles 3aallozymes 3aanalytical methods 3acolor 3agene flow 3agenetic drift 3agenetic markers 3amelanosis 3amicrosatellite repeats 3amodels 3amutation 3anatural selection 3apopulation size 3aLake Erie1 aKing, Richard B.0 tBiological journal of the Linnean Society.g2003 July, v. 79, no. 3 p.389-399dPublished for the Linnean Society of London by Blackwell [etc.]wJournal:jnl1847x0024-40667nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1095-8312.2003.00199.x  aDNAL 7aarticle04317naa a2200805 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111072000900129072000900138072000900147072000900156100002200165245010400187300001800291500002400309500001500333520186400348650001302212650001502225650002302240650001502263650002202278650002302300650002402323650002102347650001702368650001502385650002202400650002302422650002102445650001502466650001502481650002202496650001902518650002302537650001302560650004102573650001202614650002902626650003602655650003002691650005502721650005802776650001302834650002502847650001102872650002302883650002402906650002802930650004102958650005202999650003103051650006703082650002203149650001803171650001603189653002303205653003603228700001603264700001903280773012003299852000903419930003303428945002503461946001303486655001203499IND4393404620221119215127.0070722e200708  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439340462DNAL7 a176389972pmid  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL500 0aL810 0aR300 0aQ5011 aKorosteleva, S.N.10aEffects of Feedborne Fusarium Mycotoxins on the Performance, Metabolism, and Immunity of Dairy Cows  ap. 3867-3873.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aLittle is known about the effects of feedborne Fusarium mycotoxins on the performance, metabolism, and immunity of dairy cattle. A total mixed ration (TMR) containing a blend of feedstuffs naturally contaminated with Fusarium mycotoxins was fed for 56 d to 18 midlactation Holstein cows (average milk production, 33 kg/d) in a completely randomized design with repeated measures that included 3 treatments: 1) a control diet, 2) a contaminated diet, and 3) a contaminated diet + 0.2% polymeric glucomannan mycotoxin adsorbent (GMA). Wheat, corn, and hay were the contaminated feedstuffs used in the study. Deoxynivalenol was the major contaminant and was found in the TMR at levels of up to 3.6 μg/g of dry matter. Body weight, body condition score, dry matter intake, net energy balance, milk production, milk composition, somatic cell count, blood serum chemistry, hematology, serum Ig concentrations, and coagulation profile were measured. Dry matter intake and body weight, as well as milk production, milk composition, and SCC, were not affected by diet. Total serum protein and globulin levels increased significantly in cows fed the contaminated TMR compared with cows fed the control diet at 42 d, whereas the albumin:globulin ratio decreased. Serum urea concentrations were significantly elevated throughout the experiment in cows fed the contaminated diet compared with those fed the control diet. Serum IgA concentrations decreased significantly in cows fed the contaminated TMR at 36 d of feeding. Feeding GMA prevented these effects. Serum sodium concentration and osmolality levels were increased throughout the experiment in all cows fed the contaminated diets. We concluded that feed naturally contaminated with Fusarium mycotoxins can affect the metabolic parameters and immunity of dairy cows and that GMA can prevent some of these effects. 3aimmunity 3adairy cows 3aruminant nutrition 3ametabolism 3anatural toxicants 3aexperimental diets 3atotal mixed rations 3amilk composition 3aglucomannans 3amycotoxins 3afoodborne illness 3afeed contamination 3adietary exposure 3amilk yield 3aadsorbents 3adry matter intake 3abody condition 3asomatic cell count 3aFusarium 2aAnimal Feedxanalysisxmicrobiology. 2aAnimals 2aBlood Proteinsxanalysis 2aBody Constitutionxdrug effects 2aBody Weightxdrug effects 2aCatharticsxadministration & dosagexpharmacology. 2aCattlexgrowth & developmentximmunologyxmetabolism. 2aDairying 2aEatingxdrug effects 2aFemale 2aFood Contamination 2aFusariumxchemistry 2aImmunoglobulin Axblood 2aLactationxdrug effectsxphysiology. 2aMannansxadministration & dosagexpharmacology. 2aMilkxchemistryxcytology. 2aMycotoxinsxadministration & dosageximmunologyxpharmacology. 2aRandom Allocation 2aSodiumxblood 2aUreaxblood 0aanimal performance 0aglucomannan mycotoxin adsorbent1 aSmith, T.K.1 aBoermans, H.J.0 tJournal of dairy science.g2007 Aug., v. 90, no. 8 p.3867-3873dAmerican Dairy Science Associationx0022-03027nnas  aDNAL  a20071108b20071210c00000000  aINDd3CTe2007/10/23  aOther US 7aarticle02150naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002500092040001800117100002500135245009800160300001600258500002400274520116400298650001501462650001201477650002001489650001601509650002501525650001401550650001801564651001401582700001901596700002301615700001601638773009901654852000901753856003801762655001201800IND4410928020221119215330.0081003s2008    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441092802DNAL7 a10.1071/SB070492doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLumbsch, H.

An example is the genus Thelotrema s.str., a speciose genus of mostly tropical lichens. Morphological studies on Australian Thelotrema spp. were accompanied by a phylogenetic analysis of mt SSU rDNA sequence data of 19 species, including 25 newly obtained sequences. We performed maximum parsimony and Bayesian phylogenetic analyses of 50 samples, representing 25 species. Our results indicate that more species need to be accepted in Thelotrema than previously thought. Subtle morphological differences were found to be associated with independent lineages in the phylogenetic trees. Furthermore, monophyly of Thelotrema s.str. is strongly supported. On the basis of the corroboration of morphological evidence by molecular data, the new species Thelotrema capetribulense Mangold, T. crespoae Mangold, Lumbsch & Elix, T. oleosum Mangold, and T. pseudosubtile Mangold are described. The new combinations Chapsa phlyctidioides (Müll.Arg.) Mangold and Thelotrema defossum (Müll.Arg.)

More than 2,500 lactation records from 897 spring-calving Holstein-Friesian and Jersey dairy cows were used in the analyses. Six variables related to BCS and BW, including observations precalving, at calving, and nadir as well as days to nadir and change precalving and between calving and nadir were generated. An exponential function was fitted within lactation to milk and 4% fat-corrected milk (FCM) yield data to model lactation curves. The milk production variables investigated were the parameters of the fitted function as well as accumulated yield of milk and FCM at 60 and 270 days in milk and average milk composition. Mixed models were used to identify BCS and BW variables that significantly affected milk production. After adjusting for the fixed effect of year of calving, parity, and days dry, milk and FCM yields were nonlinearly associated with calving and nadir BCS, increasing at a declining rate up to BCS 6.0 to 6.5 (10-point scale; approximately 3.5 in the 5-point scale) and declining thereafter. However, there was very little increase in milk and FCM yields above a calving BCS of 5.0 (approximately 3.0 in the 5-point scale). Average milk fat content over 60 and 270 days in milk was positively correlated with increasing calving and nadir BCS. In comparison, milk protein percentage was not influenced by calving BCS but was positively associated with nadir BCS and negatively associated with BCS lost between calving and nadir. The effect of BW and changes in BW were similar to the effect of BCS, although the scale of the effect was breed-dependent. For example, milk and FCM yield increased linearly with increasing calving BCS, but the effect was greater in Holstein-Friesians compared with Jersey cows. The results are consistent with the literature and highlight the important role that BCS and BW loss has on milk production, irrespective of the system of farming. 3adairy cows 3aruminant nutrition 3abody weight 3apastures 3acalving 3alactation 3amilk production 3amilk fat 3abody condition 2aAnimal Nutritional Physiological Phenomena 2aAnimals 2aBody Constitutionxphysiology 2aBody Weightxphysiology 2aCattlexphysiology 2aDairyingxmethods 2aDietxveterinary 2aFatsxanalysis 2aFemale 2aLactationxphysiology 2aLactosexanalysis 2aMilkxchemistry 2aMilk Proteinsxanalysis 2aPoaceae 2aPregnancy 2aRegression Analysis 2aTime Factors 0amilk composition1 aLee, J.M.1 aMacdonald, K.A.1 aBerry, D.P.0 tJournal of dairy science.g2007 Aug., v. 90, no. 8 p.3802-3815dAmerican Dairy Science Associationx0022-03027nnas  aDNAL  a20071108b20071210c00000000  aINDd3CTe2007/10/22  aOther US 7aarticle02911naa a2200661 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002100111024003200132040001800164100001700182245006700199300001800266500001500284506007600299520096800375506003701343650004701380650001001427650001901437650001801456650001001474650002601484650002501510650003201535650001801567650001201585650003201597650001601629650001101645650003001656650001701686650001201703650002001715651001201735651001001747651001501757651002501772653001301797653001701810653001001827653001101837653001701848653001301865700001701878700001401895700001801909700001701927773014301944852000902087856008202096930003302178945001302211946001302224655001202237IND2328375920221207090727.0020806e20020611dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232837592DNAL7 a120348732pmid7 aPMC1230372pmcid7 a10.1073/pnas.1122220992doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJulian, G.E.10aGenetic determination of the queen caste in an ant hybrid zone  ap. 8157-8160.  a2019-12-04  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe question of how reproductives and sterile workers differentiate within eusocial groups has long been a core issue in sociobiology because it requires the loss of individual direct fitness in favor of indirect or group-level fitness grains. The evolution of social behavior requires that differentiation between workers and female reproductives be environmentally determined, because genetically determined sterility would be quickly eliminated. Nevertheless, we report clear evidence of genetic caste determination in populations of two seed harvester ant species common to the southwestern USA, Pogonomyrmex rugosus and Pogonomyrmex barbatus. The genetic differentiation between workers and queens is found only in areas of sympatry of the two species, and thus appears to arisen from hybridization. Our data suggest that this hybridization has had a profound historical effect on the caste determination systems and mating patterns of each of these species.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3arandom amplified polymorphic DNA technique 3amales 3aheterozygosity 3aqueen insects 3alabor 3aPogonomyrmex barbatus 3aPogonomyrmex rugosus 3ainterspecific hybridization 3aintrogression 2aAnimals 2aAntsxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aDNA Primers 2aFemale 2aPolymerase Chain Reaction 2aReproduction 2aSeasons 2aSocial Behavior 3aArizona 3aTexas 3aNew Mexico 0aSouthwestern States. 0agenotype 0aPogonomyrmex 0acaste 0aalates 0aalate queens 0acolonies1 aFewell, J.H.1 aGadau, J.1 aJohnson, R.A.1 aLarrabee, D.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2002 June 11, v. 99, no. 12 p.8157-8160x0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1122220993Available from publisher's Web site  a20021002b20021010c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US 7aarticle01386naa a2200397 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024001800097024003600115040001800151100001400169245009300183300001600276520020400292650001700496650001900513650001000532650005400542650001100596650000900607650003300616650002000649700001300669700001400682700001600696700001500712773007700727852000900804856008600813939003300899945000800932946001300940990002300953655001200976991570538330742620221119215449.0830926e198206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aPAR830085832DNAL7 a70751012pmid7 a10.1177/0009922882021006112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAzizi, E.10aEchinococcosis presenting as a supraclavicular mass.

Clinical experience and material testing finds horn of minor quality to be associated with the malformations. Finite element models (FEM) of a flat claw (FC), a contracted claw (CC), and a laminitic claw (LC) were designed from native claw specimens to combine material properties and altered claw geometry for stress analysis. The FEM were created by digitizing the typically deformed exungulated claw capsule by means of computed tomography or digital photography. The derived geometry data were meshed with finite elements and the material properties were attributed. Loading was performed via vertical load vectors according to the suspensory and support apparatus of the bovine digit. All FEM were loaded on soft floors. Loading of the FEM of the FC with 756 N exhibited maximum stress values of 3.32 MPa in the dorsal wall, that of the CC exhibited comparably lower stress of 1.33 MPa in the distal abaxial wall, and the model of the LC showed maximum stress of 4.51 MPa in the region of the dorsal border, all at the same loading. The solar surfaces and the corresponding imprints showed stress concentrations in the palmar aspect of the bulb in the FC, a highly stressed bearing margin of the abaxial wall in the CC, and a diffusely stressed sole and bulb in the LC in contrast to the sound claw models. The FEM of the selected pathological claw forms (FC, CC, LC) calculated high stress zones exactly at locations in the claw wall and sole where clinical experts expect the typical claw lesions for these pathologies. These results were obtained simply by exchanging the outer form of the claw capsules; the method of loading and type of flooring for these pathological models were equivalent to those of the sound FEM. It is highly possible that the stress zones derived from these calculations represent corium compression in reality, and these data support the pathophysiological theory that claw lesions may arise as a consequence thereof. 3ahoof trimming 3adeformation 3aanimal injuries 3afinite element analysis 3afoot diseases 3acattle 3amodels 3aanimal health 3aclaws 2aAnimals 2aBiomechanical Phenomenaxmethods. 2aCattle 2aCattle Diseasesxphysiopathology 2aComputer Simulation 2aFemale 2aFinite Element Analysis 2aFoot Diseasesxphysiopathologyxveterinary. 2aHoof and Clawxabnormalitiesxanatomy & histologyxphysiopathology. 2aModels, Anatomic 2aStress, Mechanical 0apathological processes and conditions 0amechanical stress1 aApprich, V.1 aPolsterer, E.1 aHaider, H.1 aStanek, C.0 tJournal of dairy science.g2007 Aug., v. 90, no. 8 p.3690-3699dAmerican Dairy Science Associationx0022-03027nnas  aDNAL  a20071108b20071210c00000000  aINDd3CTe2007/10/22  aOther US 7aarticle01435naa a2200385 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024001800097040001800115100002600133245012100159300001600280500001500296520029300311650002600604650001900630650001200649650001300661650001200674650003200686650001800718650003800736650001200774653001300786653003400799700001700833700001700850773010700867852000900974939003300983945000801016946001301024655001201037991570537550742620221119215454.0830922e198307  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aPAR830085882DNAL7 a63493952pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGabrielsen, A.A., jr.10aIdentification and partial characterization of exoantigens derived from medium used to culture Plasmodium falciparum  ap. 671-674.  a2019-12-04  aPlasmodium falciparum, exoantigens derived from culture medium, identification and partial characterization, suggestion of cross-reactivity with coccidial antigens, results show promise for use of coccidia- and Pasturella-free rabbits as model for routine screening of plasmodial antigens 3aPlasmodium falciparum 3across reaction 3aEimeria 3aantigens 2aAnimals 2aAntigens, Surfacexanalysis 2aCulture Media 2aPlasmodium falciparumximmunology 2aRabbits 0aimmunity 0aTechnique, Experimental hosts1 aJensen, J.B.1 aBoland, M.T.0 tAmerican journal of tropical medicine and hygiene.g1983 July, v. 32, no. 4 p.671-674x0002-96377nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19830922c00000000  aPAR  aOther US 7aarticle04693naa a2200697 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111072000900129072000900138100001700147245010200164300001800266500002400284500001500308520243600323650001702759650002102776650001702797650001802814650001602832650002302848650002902871650001102900650000902911650002602920650001302946650002202959650001502981650001202996650006603008650008403074650002803158650001103186650004903197650005903246650007603305650002203381650003003403650005803433650001103491650002503502650002703527650002803554650002203582650005103604650003103655653002403686653002303710700001403733700001803747700001803765773012003783852000903903930003303912945002503945946001303970655001203983IND4393403620221119215110.0070722e200708  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439340362DNAL7 a176389872pmid  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL810 0aL8321 aDrillich, M.10aTreatment of Acute Puerperal Metritis with Flunixin Meglumine in Addition to Antibiotic Treatment  ap. 3758-3763.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThe objective of this field trial was to evaluate effects of a single administration of 2.2 mg/kg of body weight (BW) of flunixin meglumine (FM) in addition to a systemic antibiotic treatment in cows with acute puerperal metritis (APM). Outcome variables tested were proportion of cows with a fever, prevalence of chronic endometritis 18 to 22 and 32 to 35 d in milk (DIM), and reproductive performance measures in the current lactation. In addition, serum concentrations of haptoglobin and fibrinogen were analyzed. Daily milk yield within 6 d after the first treatment was recorded. Cows were examined 4 to 5 DIM by rectal palpation and vaginoscopy, and rectal temperature was measured. Fetid vulvar discharge and a body temperature >=39.5°C were signs of APM. Cows with APM were treated in the reference group with 1.0 mg/kg of BW of ceftiofur on 3 to 5 consecutive days (CEF, n = 119). In the study group, cows received the same antibiotic treatment as in CEF and 2.2 mg/kg of BW of FM on treatment d 1 (CEF + FM, n = 119). Blood samples were collected 4, 6, and 10 DIM and analyzed for concentrations of haptoglobin and fibrinogen. A group of cows without APM remained untreated and served as controls (n = 9). There were no significant differences between CEF and CEF + FM in the proportion of cows with fever 1 d after the first treatment (33.6 vs. 46.2%), milk yield per milking 10 DIM (7.5 ± 0.3 vs. 7.6 ± 0.3 kg in primiparous, 9.6 ± 0.4 vs. 10.6 ± 0.4 kg in multiparous cows), prevalence of chronic endometritis 32 to 35 DIM (64.3 vs. 52.2%), and in reproductive performance (31.5 vs. 34.3% conception to first AI, 58.0 vs. 54.6% pregnancy rate, 107.8 ± 36.9 vs. 101.6 ± 41.4 d open). Compared with the control, CEF and CEF + FM had significantly greater concentrations of haptoglobin (1.1 ± 0.28 vs. 1.9 ± 0.06 and 1.8 ± 0.07 mg/mL at 4 DIM; 0.3 ± 0.15 vs. 1.1 ± 0.06 and 1.2 ± 0.07 mg/mL at 10 DIM) and fibrinogen (2.2 ± 0.17 vs. 3.9 ± 0.14 and 3.7 ± 0.13 g/L at 4 DIM; 1.9 ± 0.1 vs. 2.6 ± 0.1 and 3.0 ± 0.13 g/L, respectively, at 10 DIM) on all test days. The additional treatment with FM had no effect on these acute phase proteins. In conclusion, the single administration of 2.2 mg/kg of BW of FM in addition to a systemic antibiotic treatment of cows having APM did not result in beneficial effects on clinical cure, milk yield within 6 d after the first treatment, or reproductive performance. 3aendometritis 3aveterinary drugs 3aacute course 3adose response 3aantibiotics 3adisease prevalence 3acombination drug therapy 3adosage 3acows 3afield experimentation 3aflunixin 3apostpartum period 3amilk yield 2aAnimals 2aAnti-Bacterial Agentsxadministration & dosagexpharmacology. 2aAnti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidalxadministration & dosagexpharmacology. 2aBlood Chemical Analysis 2aCattle 2aCattle Diseasesxdrug therapyxepidemiology. 2aCephalosporinsxadministration & dosagexpharmacology. 2aClonixinxadministration & dosagexanalogs & derivativesxpharmacology. 2aDairyingxmethods 2aDrug Therapy, Combination 2aEndometritisxdrug therapyxepidemiologyxveterinary. 2aFemale 2aFibrinogenxanalysis 2aHaptoglobinsxanalysis 2aLactationxdrug effects 2aPostpartum Period 2aPuerperal Disordersxdrug therapyxveterinary. 2aReproductionxdrug effects 0aanimal reproduction 0aflunixin meglumine1 aVoigt, D.1 aForderung, D.1 aHeuwieser, W.0 tJournal of dairy science.g2007 Aug., v. 90, no. 8 p.3758-3763dAmerican Dairy Science Associationx0022-03027nnas  aDNAL  a20071108b20071210c00000000  aINDd3CTe2007/10/22  aOther US 7aarticle02642naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002100110040001800131100001700149245012100166300001800287300002300305520123600328650004301564650002701607650001801634650002201652650002101674650002101695650002101716650003301737650003701770650002901807650002201836650002101858650001901879650003401898650005401932650002401986700001802010700001602028773008502044852000902129939003302138946001302171655001202184IND8805587320221119215603.0881123e198810  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND880558732DNAL7 a30495342pmid7 aPMC2114822pmcid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchell, M.A.10aAnalysis of the Pseudomonas solanacearum polygalacturonase encoded by pglA and its involvement in phytopathogenicity  ap. 4501-4508.  ap. 4501-4508. ill.  aA major endopolygalacturonase excreted by Pseudomonas solanacearum was purified to >95% homogeneity and shown to have an isoelectric point of 9.0 and a subunit molecular mass of 52 kilodaltons (kDa). The gene encoding this enzyme pg1A) was isolated from a genomic library of P. solanacearum DNA based on its expression in Escherichia coli and shown to be contained on a 1.8-kilobase DNA fragment. The identity of the pg1A gene product and the 52-kDa polygalacturonase was demonstrated by immunoadsorption and isoelectric focusing experiments. The cloned pglA gene was apparently expressed from its own promoter in E. coli and its product was partially secreted into the periplasm. The pg1A gene was insertionally inactivated in vitro and used to mutate the chromosomal pg1A gene of P. solanacearum by marker exchange mutagenesis. The resulting mutant strain was deficient in production of the 52-kDa polygalacturonase and took twice as long to wilt and kill tomato plants as the wild-type parent in plant bioassay experiments. Complementation in trans with the wild-type cloned pglA gene restored virulence to near wild-type levels. The data indicate that the pglA gene is important, but not absolutely necessary, for pathogenesis. 3aSolanum lycopersicum var. lycopersicum 3aRalstonia solanacearum 3apathogenicity 3apolygalacturonase 3astructural genes 2aEscherichia coli 2aGenes, Bacterial 2aGenetic Complementation Test 2aGlycoside Hydrolasesxphysiology 2aImmunosorbent Techniques 2aIsoelectric Point 2aMolecular Weight 2aPlant Diseases 2aPolygalacturonasexphysiology 2aPseudomonasxenzymologyxgeneticsxpathogenicity. 2aRestriction Mapping1 aRoberts, D.P.1 aDenny, T.P.0 tJournal of bacteriology.g1988 Oct., v. 170, no. 10 p.4501-4508x0021-91937nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle03243naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072000900110072000900119100002300128245012700151300001800278500002400296500001500320520191700335650001502252650001602267650001202283650001602295650002102311650001502332650002402347650001902371650002102390650002002411650002302431651001102454653001402465653003302479700002502512700001902537700001702556773012002573852000902693930003302702945002502735946001302760655001202773IND4393402320221119215533.0070722e200708  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439340232DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL500 0aL8321 aWaller, K.

However, few studies have been performed in Europe and in commercial dairy herds. Therefore, the main aim of the study was to evaluate whether extra daily dietary supplementation of 1,610 mg of α-tocopherol, in the form of RRR-α-tocopheryl acetate, to dairy cows around calving could improve the udder health in commercial herds with a high incidence of veterinary-treated clinical mastitis. In addition, the effects of supplementation on other cow diseases, fertility, milk production, culling, and stillbirth were also studied. Cows in 21 herds in southeast Sweden were assigned to 1 of 2 groups, 1) daily supplementation with 1,610 mg of RRR-α-tocopherol from 4 wk before to 2 wk after calving (n = 196), or 2) no extra supplementation (n = 203), on top of the normal diet containing average vitamin E supplementation (on average, 386, 664, and 957 mg/d to cows at 1 mo prior to calving, at calving, and at 15 d after calving, respectively). Multivariable generalized linear mixed models were used for statistical analyses of the effects of supplementation on the cumulative incidence risk of veterinary-treated clinical mastitis and of veterinary-treated diseases other than mastitis within 1 and 2 mo after calving, culling (due to udder health or other reasons) within 2 and 9 mo after calving, the risk of stillbirth or calf death within 24 h after calving, time from calving to first insemination, number of inseminations per service period, and cow composite natural logarithm of somatic cell count and daily milk production at the first monthly testing after calving. A significant effect of supplementation was observed only for stillbirth or calf death within 24 h after birth, which was significantly lower in the supplemented group. The reasons for this finding require further study. 3adairy cows 3afetal death 3acalving 3aherd health 3aalpha-tocopherol 3amilk yield 3avitamin supplements 3audder quarters 3afeed supplements 3abovine mastitis 3asomatic cell count 3aSweden 0avitamin E 0aRRR-alpha-tocopheryl acetate1 aSandgren, C.

Ripening of HP-treated and control cheeses proceeded until d 60 at 8°C. Volatile compounds were determined throughout ripening, and analysis of related sensory characteristics was carried out on ripe cheeses. High-pressure treatments on d 2 enhanced the formation of branched-chain aldehydes and of 2-alcohols except 2-butanol, but retarded that of n-aldehydes, 2-methyl ketones, dihydroxy-ketones, n-alcohols, unsaturated alcohols, ethyl esters, propyl esters, and branched-chain esters. Differences between HP-treated and control cheeses in the levels of some volatile compounds tended to disappear during ripening. The odor of ripe cheeses was scarcely affected by HP treatments on d 2, but aroma quality and intensity scores were lowered in comparison with control cheese of the same age. On the other hand, HP treatments on d 50 did not influence either the volatile compound profile or the sensory characteristics of 60-d-old cheese. 3acheese ripening 3acheeses 3aodor compounds 3ahigh pressure treatment 3aodors 3aewe milk 2aAnimals 2aCheesexanalysis 2aFood Handlingxmethods 2aMilk 2aOdorants. 2aOrganic Chemicalsxanalysisxchemistry. 2aPressure 2aSheep 2aStatistics as Topic 2aTime Factors 2aVolatilization 0avolatile compounds 0asensory properties 0aLa Serena cheese1 aGarde, S.1 aFernández García, E.1 aGaya, P.1 aNuñez, M.0 tJournal of dairy science.g2007 Aug., v. 90, no. 8 p.3627-3639dAmerican Dairy Science Associationx0022-03027nnas  aDNAL  a20071108b20071210c00000000  aINDd3CTe2007/10/22  aOther US 7aarticle03923naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111072000900129100001300138245011900151300001800270500002400288520212400312650004402436650001502480650002802495650002102523650001702544650001102561650001702572650001802589650002102607650001902628650001602647650002602663650001202689650002102701650003302722650002702755650004102782650003002823650004502853650002702898650002102925650003102946650005402977650002403031653001703055700002603072700001703098700001803115773012003133852000903253930003303262945002503295946001303320655001203333IND4393401820221119215412.0070722e200708  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439340182DNAL7 a176389692pmid  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ5011 aKoca, N.10aApplication of Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy for Monitoring Short-Chain Free Fatty Acids in Swiss Cheese  ap. 3596-3603.  aIncludes references  aShort-chain free fatty acids (FFA) are important sources of cheese flavor and have been reported to be indicators for assessing quality. The objective of this research was to develop a simple and rapid screening tool for monitoring the short-chain FFA contents in Swiss cheese by using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). Forty-four Swiss cheese samples were evaluated by using a MIRacle three-reflection diamond attenuated total reflectance (ATR) accessory. Two different sampling techniques were used for FTIR/ATR measurement: direct measurement of Swiss cheese slices (~0.5 g) and measurement of a water-soluble fraction of cheese. The amounts of FFA (propionic, acetic, and butyric acids) in the water-soluble fraction of samples were analyzed by gas chromatography-flame ion-ization detection as a reference method. Calibration models for both direct measurement and the water-soluble fraction of cheese were developed based on a cross-validated (leave-one-out approach) partial least squares regression by using the regions of 3,000 to 2,800, 1,775 to 1,680, and 1,500 to 900 cm⁻¹ for short-chain FFA in cheese. Promising performance statistics were obtained for the calibration models of both direct measurement and the water-soluble fraction, with improved performance statistics obtained from the water-soluble extract, particularly for propionic acid. Partial least squares models generated from FTIR/ATR spectra by direct measurement of cheeses gave standard errors of cross-validation of 9.7 mg/100 g of cheese for propionic acid, 9.3 mg/100 g of cheese for acetic acid, and 5.5 mg/100 g of cheese for butyric acid, and correlation coefficients >0.9. Standard error of cross-validation values for the water-soluble fraction were 4.4 mg/100 g of cheese for propionic acid, 9.2 mg/100 g of cheese for acetic acid, and 5.2 mg/100 g of cheese for butyric acid with correlation coefficients of 0.98, 0.95, and 0.92, respectively. Infrared spectroscopy and chemometrics accurately and precisely predicted the short-chain FFA content in Swiss cheeses and in the water-soluble fraction of the cheese. 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3amonitoring 3ashort chain fatty acids 3afree fatty acids 3aSwiss cheese 3aflavor 3afood quality 3afood analysis 3afood composition 3apropionic acid 3aacetic acid 3amultivariate analysis 2aAnimals 2aCheesexanalysis 2aChromatography, Gasxmethods 2aDietary Fatsxanalysis 2aFatty Acids, Nonesterifiedxanalysis 2aFlame Ionizationxmethods 2aFood Analysisxinstrumentationxmethods. 2aLeast-Squares Analysis 2aReference Values 2aReproducibility of Results 2aSpectroscopy, Fourier Transform Infraredxmethods 2aStatistics as Topic 0achemometrics1 aRodriguez-Saona, L.E.1 aHarper, W.J.1 aAlvarez, V.B.0 tJournal of dairy science.g2007 Aug., v. 90, no. 8 p.3596-3603dAmerican Dairy Science Associationx0022-03027nnas  aDNAL  a20071108b20071210c00000000  aINDd3CTe2007/10/21  aOther US 7aarticle02737naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127072000900145072000900154072000900163072000900172100002200181245016800203300001400371500002400385500001500409520114700424650002301571650002101594650001801615650000901633650001101642650002101653650001501674650001801689650002101707650002701728650001801755653002001773653001701793653001601810653003101826700002001857700002101877700002501898773012101923852000902044856008502053930003302138945002502171946001102196655001202207IND4393262520221119215214.0070722e200707  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439326252DNAL7 a10.1007/s11240-007-9233-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aP000 0aF600 0aF200 0aF1401 aBairu, Michael W.10aOptimizing the micropropagation protocol for the endangered Aloe polyphylla: can meta-topolin and its derivatives serve as replacement for benzyladenine and zeatin  ap. 15-23.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aBenzyladenine (BA) is the most widely used cytokinin in the micropropagation industry due to its effectiveness and affordability. It, however, has disadvantages such as genetic alteration and abnormal growth in some plants. Naturally occurring zeatin on the other hand is not as widely used as BA and is far more expensive. The use of meta-topolin and its derivatives as alternatives to BA and zeatin, both of which frequently have negative effects in tissue culture was investigated. In vitro grown Aloe polyphylla (an endangered medicinal and ornamental aloe) were cultured on full strength Murashige and Skoog basal medium with different concentrations of cytokinins and solidified with 1% Bacteriological Agar (Oxoid No. 1). mT was the preferred cytokinin both in terms of multiplication rate and rooting. The optimum concentration that induced regeneration and rooting is 5.0 μM. The problem of hyperhydricity was totally controlled. Plants rooted spontaneously in multiplication medium, thus avoiding the extra rooting step of the protocol. More than 91% of the plants transferred to ex vitro conditions were successfully acclimatized. 3aendangered species 3ain vitro culture 3adose response 3aAloe 3azeatin 3amedicinal plants 3acytokinins 3abenzyladenine 3amicropropagation 3agermplasm conservation 3aculture media 0aAloe polyphylla 0ameta-topolin 0amethodology 0aMurashige and Skoog medium1 aStirk, Wendy A.1 aDoležal, Karel.1 aVan Staden, Johannes0 tPlant cell, tissue, and organ culture.g2007 July, v. 90, no. 1 p.15-23dKluwer Academic Publishersx0167-68577nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11240-007-9233-43Available from publisher's Web site  a20071020b20071102c00000000  aINDdMKSe2007/10/20  aNon-US 7aarticle01722naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127072000900145100002900154245007100183300001200254500002400266500001500290520055900305650002000864650001600884650002600900650001900926650002500945650002100970650001900991653002101010653002301031773011901054852000901173856008501182930003301267945002501300946001101325655001201336IND4393262220221119215149.0070722e200707  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439326222DNAL7 a10.1007/s11240-007-9249-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF6001 aNamasivayam, Parameswari10aAcquisition of embryogenic competence during somatic embryogenesis  ap. 1-8.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThis review focuses on investigation in acquisition of embryogenic competence during somatic embryogenesis in the last five decades.

Nodal explants from seedlings gave higher multiplication rates than explants from adult plants. Cultures initiated at the beginning of May produced the highest percentage of shoot forming explants and multiplication rate. Woody Plant Medium (WPM) salts, with 100 mg l-¹ myoinositol, 1 mg l-¹ thiamine, 0.5 mg l-¹ pyridoxine, 0.5 mg l-¹ nicotinic acid and 3% sucrose was used as basal medium and several cytokinins at various concentrations were evaluated for their effect on shoot multiplication. The highest shoot multiplication rate was obtained with 4.44 μΜ BA. IBA at 9.84 μΜ in the culture medium during the first week of culture, and if followed by culture in hormone-free medium, gave the best rooting results. Darkness at the beginning of the rooting period did not improve rooting. The use of plastic wrap as a cover material of the culture vessels enhanced rooting percentage and root number. Plantlets acclimatized ex vitro in soil from the natural environment of the species survived at a higher percentage (up to 93%) and had more vigorous growth than plantlets grown in a compost-perlite (2:1 v/v) medium (up to 36%). 3aendangered species 3aseedlings 3abenzyladenine 3amicropropagation 3athiamin 3ashoots 3aQuercus 3adose response 3aexplants 3apyridoxine 3ain vitro regeneration 3aforest trees 3amyo-inositol 3aculture media 3atree age 3aindole butyric acid 3acytokinins 3aindigenous species 3aniacin 3agermplasm conservation 3aGreece 0amethodology 0ain vitro culture 0aWoody Plant Medium 0aQuercus euboica1 aPapafotiou, M.q(Maria)0 tPlant cell, tissue, and organ culture.g2007 July, v. 90, no. 1 p.111-116dKluwer Academic Publishersx0167-68577nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11240-007-9232-53Available from publisher's Web site  a20071020b20071102c00000000  aINDdMKSe2007/10/20  aNon-US 7aarticle04085naa a2200697 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146072000900164072000900173072000900182072000900191100002300200245014700223300001700370500002400387520187600411650002202287650001202309650002502321650003102346650002402377650002102401650001102422650002002433650002302453650002302476650001302499650001602512650002102528650002702549650001202576650004802588650003102636650002402667650003902691650002202730650004002752650002802792650002002820650002502840650003902865650001902904653002002923653002902943653002302972653003602995653002703031700002203058700002803080773010203108852000903210856008503219930003303304945002503337946001303362655001203375IND4393260220221119215114.0070722e200705  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439326022DNAL7 a174156252pmid7 a10.1007/s10886-007-9273-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF821 0aF600 0aL300 0aL0011 aDelphia, Casey M. 10aInduction of Plant Volatiles by Herbivores with Different Feeding Habits and the Effects of Induced Defenses on Host-Plant Selection by Thrips  ap. 997-1012.  aIncludes references  aInduced plant responses to attack by chewing insects have been intensively studied, but little is known about plant responses to nonchewing insects or to attack by multiple herbivores with different feeding habits. We examined volatile emissions by tobacco, Nicotiana tabacum, in response to feeding by the piercing-sucking insect western flower thrips (WFT), Frankliniella occidentalis, the chewing herbivore Heliothis virescens, and both herbivores simultaneously. In addition, we examined the effects of herbivore-induced plant defenses on host-plant selection by WFT. Plants responded to thrips feeding by consistently releasing five compounds. Simultaneous feeding by WFT and H. virescens elicited the same 11 compounds emitted in response to caterpillar feeding alone; however, two compounds, α-humulene and caryophyllene oxide, were produced in greater amounts in response to simultaneous herbivory. In choice tests, thrips consistently preferred uninduced plants over all other treatments and preferred plants damaged by caterpillars and those treated with caterpillar saliva over those treated with caterpillar regurgitant. The results are consistent with a previous finding that caterpillar regurgitant induces the release of significantly more volatile nicotine than plants damaged by caterpillars or plants treated with caterpillar saliva. A repellent effect of nicotine on WFT was confirmed by encircling unwounded plants with septa releasing volatile nicotine. Our results provide the first direct evidence that thrips feeding induces volatile responses and indicates that simultaneous herbivory by insects with different feeding habits can alter volatile emissions. In addition, the findings demonstrate that induced plant responses influence host-plant selection by WFT and suggest that the induction of volatile nicotine may play a role in this process. 3aNicotiana tabacum 3atobacco 3aphytophagous insects 3aFrankliniella occidentalis 3aHeliothis virescens 3afeeding behavior 3asaliva 3apest resistance 3ainduced resistance 3avolatile compounds 3anicotine 3ahost plants 3ahost preferences 3aplant-insect relations 2aAnimals 2aFeeding Behaviorxdrug effectsxphysiology. 2aHost-Parasite Interactions 2aIndolesxmetabolism 2aInsectaxdrug effectsxphysiology. 2aLarvaxphysiology 2aNicotinexmetabolismxpharmacology. 2aOvipositionxphysiology 2aSalivary Glands 2aTerpenesxmetabolism 2aTobaccoxparasitologyxphysiology. 2aVolatilization 0achewing insects 0apiercing-sucking insects 0ainsect regurgitant 0aherbivore-induced plant defense 0aoviposition preference1 aMescher, Mark C. 1 aDe Moraes, Consuelo M. 0 tJournal of chemical ecology.g2007 May, v. 33, no. 5 p.997-1012dSpringer-Verlagx0098-03317nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10886-007-9273-63Available from publisher's Web site  a20070906b20071002c00000000  aINDdNZMe2007/09/06  aOther US 7aarticle01844naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002800092040001800120100002200138245010700160300001800267520068400285650001300969650002100982650003301003650001901036650001301055650001101068650002201079700002501101700002201126700001701148700002301165700002301188700001701211773014201228852000901370856007801379946001301457655001201470IND4446167520221119215126.0101208e20061215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444616752DNAL7 a10.1002/pola.218072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSangermano, Marco10aSynthesis and cationic photopolymerization of new fluorinated, polyfunctional propenyl ether oligomers  ap. 6943-6951.  aNew fluorinated, polyfunctional propenyl ether functionalized resins were synthesized, and their behavior in cationic photopolymerization was investigated.

T.10aMapping Rph20: a gene conferring adult plant resistance to Puccinia hordei in barley  ap. 55-68.  aIncludes references  aA doubled haploid (DH) barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) population of 334 lines (ND24260 × Flagship) genotyped with DArT markers was used to map genes for adult plant resistance (APR) to leaf rust (Puccinia hordei Otth) under field conditions in Australia and Uruguay. The Australian barley cultivar Flagship carries an APR gene (qRphFlag) derived from the cultivar Vada. Association analysis and composite interval mapping identified two genes conferring APR in this DH population. qRphFlag was mapped to the short arm of chromosome 5H (5HS), accounting for 64-85% of the phenotypic variation across four field environments and 56% under controlled environmental conditions (CEC). A second quantitative trait locus (QTL) from ND24260 (qRphND) with smaller effect was mapped to chromosome 6HL. In the absence of qRphFlag, qRphND conferred only a low level of resistance. DH lines displaying the highest level of APR carried both genes. Sequence information for the critical DArT marker bPb-0837 (positioned at 21.2 cM on chromosome 5HS) was used to develop bPb-0837-PCR, a simple PCR-based marker for qRphFlag. The 245 bp fragment for bPb-0837-PCR was detected in a range of barley cultivars known to possess APR, which was consistent with previous tests of allelism, demonstrating that the qRphFlag resistant allele is common in leaf rust resistant cultivars derived from Vada and Emir. qRphFlag has been designated Rph20, the first gene conferring APR to P. hordei to be characterised in barley. The PCR marker will likely be effective in marker-assisted selection for Rph20. 3aHordeum vulgare 3aPuccinia hordei 3aalleles 3abarley 3achromosome mapping 3achromosomes 3acultivars 3aenvironmental factors 3ahaploidy 3aleaf rust 3amarker-assisted selection 3amature plants 3aphenotypic variation 3apolymerase chain reaction 3aquantitative trait loci 2aBasidiomycotaxpathogenicity 2aChromosome Mapping 2aChromosomes, Plant 2aGene Expression Regulation, Plant 2aGenes, Plant 2aGenotype 2aHordeumxgeneticsximmunologyxmicrobiology. 2aImmunity, Innate 2aPhenotype 2aPlant Diseasesxgeneticsximmunologyxmicrobiology. 2aPlant Immunity 2aPlant Leavesxgeneticsxmicrobiology. 2aQuantitative Trait Loci 3aAustralia 3aUruguay 0aAustralia 0aUruguay1 aLawson, W.1 aPlatz, G.

Fresh fruit feature prominently in on-line grocery advertising, but fruit has special challenges that set them apart from most grocery products: they should be delivered in an optimum ready-to-eat state rather than simply in a minimum time; and there can be much variation in taste and texture between individual pieces. These challenges exist for conventional fruit trading, but are particularly important for e-tailing because it removes the customer's traditional role in selecting their own fruit, and thus the blame for any disappointment will be wholly on the e-tailer. As e-tailers put considerable value on the trustworthiness of their brand, this will generate a new demand for technology that will require the fruit supply chain to improve the predictability and safety of its products. In the near future we can expect to see the demands of business-to-consumer e-commerce driving a transformation in the global fruit trade into an information-intensive industry, leading to the implementation of many new sensor systems. Technology companies entering the fruit industry and creating vertically integrated operations from orchard to retail will bring an enthusiasm for new technology, the resources to develop it and the means to extract value from it. Orchard and fruit monitoring, predictive data mining and postharvest condition management will become increasingly common throughout the fruit supply chain. 3aadvertising 3abusiness enterprises 3ae-commerce 3aindustry 3amonitoring 3aorchards 3araw fruit 3aready-to-eat foods 3asupply chain 3ataste 3atechnology 3atexture 3aChina1 aSharrock, K.

The utility of this response is unknown. We hypothesize that phenological delay in low P is beneficial by permitting more time for phosphorus acquisition and utilization. We grew seven genotypes of Arabidopsis thaliana with contrasting phenology in high and low P. Low P delayed bolting and maturity in all genotypes. Low P decreased root length, but not root-length duration (the integral of root length over time), because phenological delay allowed low-P plants to compensate for shorter root length. Root-length duration was correlated with phosphorus accumulation. Leaf phosphorus duration (the integral of leaf phosphorus over time) was correlated with reproductive biomass, indicating the utility of increased phosphorus utilization. Phenological delays accounted for up to 30% of biomass production when low-P plants were compared to models of plants with no delays. These results support the hypothesis that phenological delay in low P is adaptive and leads to increased phosphorus acquisition and utilization. Because low P conditions are prevalent, understanding the utility of this response could be useful in crop breeding and in predicting plant responses to global climate change. 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3aannuals 3anutrient availability 3anutrient deficiencies 3aphenology 3amodels 3anutrient uptake 3asoil 3abolting 3agenotype 3aleaves 3aplant reproduction 3abiomass production 3aplant response 3aroot growth 3aphosphorus 3aroots 3aabiotic stress 2aArabidopsisxgeneticsxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aBiomass 2aGenotype 2aLinear Models 2aPhosphorusxmetabolism 2aPlant Leavesxgeneticsxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aPlant Rootsxgeneticsxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aReproduction 2aSoil 0areproduction1 aLynch, Jonathan P.0 tPlant, cell and environment.g2008 Oct., v. 31, no. 10 p.1432-1441dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0140-77917nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-3040.2008.01857.x 7aarticle03100naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002100111024003200132040001800164100001800182245012100200300001800321506007600339520139700415506003701812650001501849650001601864650001801880650002101898650001601919650001801935650001701953650001201970650003201982650001302014650000802027650002802035650001602063650001702079650001002096653003202106653001502138653002202153653002402175653002502199700001502224700001502239773014202254852000902396856008202405930003302487945001302520946001302533655001202546IND2328171720221207090738.0020723e20020416dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232817172DNAL7 a119600262pmid7 aPMC1228372pmcid7 a10.1073/pnas.0825806992doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHolmstrup, M.10aSupercool or dehydrate? An experimental analysis of overwintering strategies in small permeable arctic invertebrates  ap. 5716-5720.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aSoil invertebrate survival in freezing temperatures has generally been considered in the light of the physiological adaptations seen in surface living insects. These adaptations, notably the ability to supercool, have evolved in concert with surface invertebrates' ability to retain body water in a dry environment. However, most soil invertebrates are orders of magnitude less resistant to desiccation than these truly terrestrial insects, opening the possibility that the mechanisms involved in their cold-hardiness are also of a radically different nature. Permeable soil invertebrates dehydrate when exposed in frozen soil. This dehydration occurs because the water vapor pressure of supercooled water is higher than that of ice at the same temperature. The force of this vapor pressure difference is so large that even a few degrees of supercooling will result in substantial water loss, continuing until the vapor pressure of body fluids equals that of the surrounding ice. At this stage, the risk of tissue ice formation has been eliminated, and subzero survival is ensured. Here we show that these soil invertebrates do not base their winter survival on supercooling, as do many other ectotherms, but instead dehydrate and equilibrate their body-fluid melting point to the ambient temperature. They can achieve this equilibration even at the extreme cooling rates seen in polar soils.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aOnychiurus 3aDendrobaena 3aoverwintering 3athermoregulation 3abody fluids 3amelting point 3asupercooling 2aAnimals 2aBody Temperature Regulation 2aFreezing 2aIce 2aOligochaetaxphysiology 2aTemperature 2aTime Factors 2aWater 0adehydration (physiological) 0asimulation 0afrozen conditions 0aonychiurus arcticus 0adendrobaena octaedra1 aBayley, M.1 aRamlov, H.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2002 Apr. 16, v. 99, no. 8 p.5716-5720x0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.0825806993Available from publisher's Web site  a20020903b20020909c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US 7aarticle02769naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002500092040001800117100002300135245016200158300001600320500002400336500001500360520135200375650001501727650001501742650002601757650001101783650001201794650001401806650001401820650001201834650001301846650002601859650001301885650001901898650001401917650002201931650001201953650001201965650002201977651001101999653001102010700002302021700002302044700002202067700002802089773009902117852000902216856003802225655001202263IND4457908920221119214810.0110513s2011    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445790892DNAL7 a10.1071/BT102752doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBedetti, Cibele S.10aAbiotic factors modulate phenotypic plasticity in an apomictic shrub [Miconia albicans (SW.)

In this study, we examined the patterns of intraspecific variation in leaf traits of Miconia albicans (Melastomataceae), a widespread, obligatory apomictic shrub, across a soil fertility gradient in the Cerrado (Brazilian savanna). We predicted high plasticity because selection favours high phenotypic plasticity in asexual populations with low genetic variability. Leaves were sampled in campo sujo (grassland), cerrado (savanna) and cerradão (woodland) in south-eastern Brazil during both dry and rainy seasons to calculate leaf area, specific leaf area, leaf tissue thickness, trichome and stomata density. We found significant between-season variation in leaf traits, indicating that the production of season-specific leaves is a strategy to cope with the strong seasonality. Both multivariate analysis and the relative distance plasticity index indicate lower plasticity during the dry season, especially under shade. Our results show that the phenotypic plasticity can be modulated by changes in abiotic factors and the combination of shade and drought can limit the expression of phenotypic plasticity. 3adry season 3agrasslands 3aphenotypic plasticity 3ashrubs 3aMiconia 3atrichomes 3aleaf area 3adrought 3ahabitats 3amultivariate analysis 3asavannas 3asoil fertility 3awoodlands 3agenetic variation 3astomata 3acerrado 3acoping strategies 3aBrazil 0aleaves1 aAguiar, Débora B.1 aJannuzzi, Maria C.1 aMoura, Maria Z.D.1 aSilveira, Fernando A.O.0 tAustralian journal of botany.g2011, v. 59, no. 3 p.274-282dCSIRO Publishingx0067-19247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1071/BT10275 7aarticle03046naa a2200625 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002000111024003200131040001800163100001700181245006500198300002000263506007600283520123600359506003701595650001901632650002201651650001701673650000901690650001201699650001101711650001901722650002301741650003601764650002101800650002501821650001201846650002301858650002201881650000901903651001101912651001201923651001101935651001101946651001101957651001801968700001301986700001701999700001902016700001702035700001402052700001302066700001702079700001702096773014502113852000902258856008202267930003302349945001302382946001302395655001202408IND2328251320221207090101.0020726e20011218dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232825132DNAL7 a117420942pmid7 aPMC649362pmcid7 a10.1073/pnas.2615551982doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMyneni, R.B.12aA large carbon sink in the woody biomass of Northern forests  ap. 14784-14789.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe terrestrial carbon sink, as of yet unidentified, represents 15-30% of annual global emissions of carbon from fossil fuels and industrial activities. Some of the missing carbon is sequestered in vegetation biomass and, under the Kyoto Protocol of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, industrialized nations can use certain forest biomass sinks to meet their greenhouse gas emissions reduction commitments. Therefore, we analyzed 19 years of data from remote-sensing spacecraft and forest inventories to identify the size and location of such sinks. The results, which cover the years 1981-1999, reveal a picture of biomass carbon gains in Eurasian boreal and North American temperate forests and losses in some Canadian boreal forests. For the 1.42 billion hectares of Northern forests, roughly above the 30th parallel, we estimate the biomass sink to be 0.68 +/- 0.34 billion tons carbon per year, of which nearly 70% is in Eurasia, in proportion to its forest area and in disproportion to its biomass carbon pool. The relatively high spatial resolution of these estimates permits direct validation with ground data and contributes to a monitoring program of forest biomass sinks under the Kyoto protocol.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aboreal forests 3adeciduous forests 3aforest trees 3awood 3abiomass 3acarbon 3aremote sensing 3atemporal variation 3achemical constituents of plants 3aforest inventory 3acarbon sequestration 2aBiomass 2aCarbonxmetabolism 2aTreesxmetabolism 2aWood 3aCanada 3aFinland 3aNorway 3aRussia 3aSweden 3aUnited States1 aDong, J.1 aTucker, C.J.1 aKaufmann, R.K.1 aKauppi, P.E.1 aLiski, J.1 aZhou, L.1 aAlexeyev, V.1 aHughes, M.K.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2001 Dec. 18, v. 98, no. 26 p.14784-14789x0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2615551983Available from publisher's Web site  a20021002b20021010c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US 7aarticle03800naa a2200721 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111072000900129072000900138072000900147100001700156245011100173300001800284500002400302500001500326520171500341650002202056650001402078650001502092650001002107650001002117650002902127650001202156650002102168650002102189650001802210650002002228650001702248650002202265650001102287650001902298650001202317650005102329650001302380650004602393650001902439650001302458650006102471650001102532650003702543650002202580650004902602650004202651650000902693650002302702650002402725650001402749650002402763651001202787653001202799700002002811700001602831700001902847773012002866852000902986930003302995945002503028946001303053655001203066IND4393405120221119214710.0070722e200708  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439340512DNAL7 a176390022pmid  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL100 0aL200 0aL2101 aHayhurst, C.10aMetabolic Regulation in Danish Bull Calves and the Relationship to the Fertility of Their Female Offspring  ap. 3909-3916.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThe objective of this work was to estimate the genetic variation of free fatty acids (FFA), glucose, growth hormone (GH), and insulin in juvenile male dairy calves and to assess the relationships, if present, with the fertility of their female offspring. This study used data from 1,498 (269.5 d of age ± 11.1) male calves from a multiple ovulation and embryo transfer breeding scheme (data collected from 1997 to 2002). Calves were Danish Holstein (n = 1,047), Danish Jersey (n = 200), and Red Dane (n = 251), and were sampled following an overnight fast at approximately 9 mo of age. Plasma samples were assayed for basal FFA, glucose, GH, and insulin. Estimated breeding values of female fertility (high values indicating better fertility), based on progeny-test results for approximately 100 daughters per sire, were available for a subset (n = 810) of the male calves as adult sires. Data from Danish Holstein alone or Danish Holstein, Red Dane, and Danish Jersey combined (all breeds) were analyzed for each trait. In both data sets, the estimates of heritabilities of glucose (0.27 ± 0.06), FFA (0.11 ± 0.05), and insulin (0.21 ± 0.06) were moderate, and that of GH (0.09 ± 0.05) was low. Correlations of estimated breeding values for fertility traits with glucose and FFA breeding values were negative, indicating that male calves with high glucose or FFA had female offspring with reduced fertility. Selection for bull calves with lower concentrations of glucose and FFA following an overnight fast could result in female offspring with genetically better fertility. Glucose and FFA may therefore be of interest to enhance selection for improved female fertility, as a measurement in young bulls. 3abreed differences 3adaughters 3ametabolism 3asires 3abulls 3aphysiological regulation 3aglucose 3afree fatty acids 3afemale fertility 3acattle breeds 3aprogeny testing 3aheritability 3agenetic variation 3acalves 3abreeding value 2aAnimals 2aBlood Glucosexanalysisxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aBreeding 2aCattlexgeneticsxmetabolismxphysiology. 2aCohort Studies 2aDairying 2aFatty Acids, Nonesterifiedxbloodxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aFemale 2aFertilityxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aGenetic Variation 2aGrowth Hormonexbloodxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aInsulinxbloodxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aMale 2aModels, Biological 2aModels, Statistical 2aPhenotype 2aStatistics as Topic 3aDenmark 0aprogeny1 aSørensen, M.K.1 aRoyal, M.D.1 aLøvendahl, P.0 tJournal of dairy science.g2007 Aug., v. 90, no. 8 p.3909-3916dAmerican Dairy Science Associationx0022-03027nnas  aDNAL  a20071108b20071210c00000000  aINDd3CTe2007/10/23  aOther US 7aarticle03048naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111072000900129072000900138100001800147245005700165300001800222500002400240520148300264650001801747650001701765650001801782650000901800650001701809650001801826650002101844650002201865650002501887650001201912650001301924650004001937650002501977650002802002650001302030650001902043650001102062650003102073650002702104650003102131650002802162650001702190651001002207700001802217700001802235700001702253773012002270852000902390930003302399945002502432946001302457655001202470IND4393405920221119215103.0070722e200708  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439340592DNAL7 a176390102pmid  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL200 0aQ5011 aDe Marchi, M.10aMilk Coagulation Ability of Five Dairy Cattle Breeds  ap. 3986-3992.  aIncludes references  aSamples of herd milk (506) were analyzed to assess sources of variation for milk coagulation properties (MCP) for 5 different dairy cattle breeds. Data were recorded in 55 single-breed dairy herds in the Trento province, a mountain area in northeast Italy. The 5 cattle breeds were Holstein-Friesian (8 herds), Brown Swiss (16 herds), Simmental (10 herds), Rendena (13 herds), and Alpine Gray (8 herds). Herd milk samples were analyzed for the MCP traits, milk rennet coagulation time (RCT), curd-firming time, and curd firmness (a₃₀), as well as protein and fat percentages, somatic cell count, Soxhlet-Henkel acidity, and bacterial count. An ANOVA was performed to study the effect of breed, herd within breed, DIM, month of lactation, protein and fat percentages, somatic cell score, titratable acidity, and log bacterial count within breed on MCP. Breed was the most important source of variation. In particular, the Rendena breed showed the best MCP traits at 13.5 min and 27.0 mm for RCT and a₃₀, respectively. The Holstein-Friesian breed had the worst coagulation properties at 18.0 min and 17.5 mm for RCT and a₃₀, respectively. The other 3 breeds showed intermediate coagulation properties. The RCT values were better at the beginning of lactation, whereas RCT and a₃₀ values were better in September and October (14.3 min and 25.7 mm, respectively). Among the composition traits, only the titratable acidity affected MCP traits of herd milk positively. 3amilk clotting 3adairy cattle 3acattle breeds 3amilk 3amilk quality 3amilk analysis 3amilk composition 3abreed differences 2aAnalysis of Variance 2aAnimals 2aBreeding 2aCattlexclassificationxphysiology. 2aChymosinxmetabolism 2aColony Count, Microbial 2aDairying 2aFatsxanalysis 2aFemale 2aHydrogen-Ion Concentration 2aLeast-Squares Analysis 2aMilkxchemistryxcytology. 2aMilk Proteinsxanalysis 2aTime Factors 3aItaly1 aDal Zotto, R.1 aCassandro, M.1 aBittante, G.0 tJournal of dairy science.g2007 Aug., v. 90, no. 8 p.3986-3992dAmerican Dairy Science Associationx0022-03027nnas  aDNAL  a20071108b20071210c00000000  aINDd3CTe2007/10/23  aOther US 7aarticle03135naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002000111024003200131040001800163100001800181245009700199300002000296500001500316506007600331520134900407506003701756650001801793650002001811650002801831650001401859650002401873650002301897650002001920650001001940650002001950650001701970650002101987650001202008650005302020650002602073650001402099650003502113653001402148653003902162653002002201653001602221700001802237700001902255773014502274852000902419856008202428930003302510945001302543946001302556655001202569IND2328251620221207094040.0020726e20011218dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232825162DNAL7 a117420762pmid7 aPMC649412pmcid7 a10.1073/pnas.2514464982doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChavous, D.A.10aExtension of the Drosophila lifespan by overexpression of a protein repair methyltransferase  ap. 14814-14818.  a2019-12-04  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aAtypical protein isoaspartyl residues arise spontaneously during the aging process from the deamidation of protein asparaginyl residues and the isomerization of protein aspartyl residues. These abnormal residues are modified in cells by a strongly conserved protein carboxyl methyltransferase (PCMT) as a first step in a repair pathway. Because a decline in cellular repair mechanisms is hypothesized to contribute to senescence, we determined whether increased PCMT activity was correlated with enhanced longevity. Two ubiquitous promoters were used with the binary GAL4-UAS system to drive PCMT overexpression in Drosophila melanogaster. Flies expressing PCMT activity under the regulation of either the hsp70 or actin5C promoter had enzyme activities that were 3- or 7-fold higher, respectively, than control flies at 29 degrees C. Correlated with the observed increases in PCMT activities, such flies lived on average 32-39% longer than control flies. Lifespan extension was not observed at 25 degrees C with either hsp70- or actin5C-driven expression, indicating a temperature-dependent effect on longevity. We conclude that protein repair is an important factor in the determination of lifespan under certain environmental conditions. PCMT activity may become limiting under mild stress conditions that accelerate rates of protein damage.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3amessenger RNA 3arecombinant DNA 3aDrosophila melanogaster 3alongevity 3agene overexpression 3atransgenic animals 3aembryo (animal) 3agenes 3aenzyme activity 3atransferases 3apromoter regions 2aAnimals 2aDrosophila melanogasterxembryologyxphysiology. 2aIn Situ Hybridization 2aLongevity 2aMethyltransferasesxmetabolism 0apcmt gene 0aprotein carboxyl methyltransferase 0agene expression 0astimulation1 aJackson, F.R.1 aO'Connor, C.M.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2001 Dec. 18, v. 98, no. 26 p.14814-14818x0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2514464983Available from publisher's Web site  a20021002b20021010c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US 7aarticle01642naa a2200445 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100001800115245004600133300001500179500012900194500002300323500001500346520035000361650001100711650001200722650001700734650001600751650001600767650002300783650002500806650001000831650001500841650001300856650002400869651003700893653002700930653001900957653002300976653002000999700001601019773008601035852000901121939003301130945000801163946001301171655001201184991570523550742620221119215044.0921027s1990    xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI920032382DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchoepf, B.G.10aGender, land, and hunger in Eastern Zaire  ap. 75-106.  aIn the series analytic: African food systems in crises. 2.

Retrospective case series. Dogs with traumatic vertebral column injuries (n=5). Medical records of dogs with vertebral column fractures and/or luxations stabilized with spinal arch external skeletal fixator frames applied using a closed fluoroscopic-assisted technique were reviewed. Owners were contacted to obtain long-term clinical outcomes. Five dogs (age range, 6-72 months; weight, 10-54 kg) had traumatic vertebral column injuries stabilized with spinal arch external skeletal fixators applied in closed fashion. Injuries involved vertebral segments of the thoracolumbar junction, lumbar spine, and lumbosacral junction. Immediately postoperatively, 4 dogs had anatomic alignment of their vertebral fracture/luxation; 1 dog had 1 mm of vertebral canal height compromise. Time to fixator removal ranged from 65 to 282 days (141±87 days). All dogs had regained satisfactory neurologic function by 3 months. At long-term follow-up (range, 282-780 days; mean 445±190 days) all dogs were judged to have good to excellent return of function by their owners. Successful closed fluoroscopic-assisted application of external skeletal fixators using spinal arches provided satisfactory reduction with few complications in 5 dogs. Return to function was judged to be good to excellent in all dogs at long-term evaluation. Closed fluoroscopic-assisted application of ESF using spinal arches provided satisfactory reduction and effective stabilization of spinal fractures with few complications and should be considered as a treatment approach. 3aneurophysiology 3aveterinary equipment 3afracture fixation 3avertebrae 3adogs 3abone fractures 3aendoscopy 3afunctional status 3adisease course 2aAnimals 2aDog Diseasesxsurgery 2aDogs 2aExternal Fixatorsxveterinary 2aLaminectomyxmethodsxveterinary. 2aLumbar Vertebraexinjuriesxsurgery. 2aRetrospective Studies 2aSpinal Cord Compressionxsurgeryxveterinary. 2aThoracic Vertebraexinjuriesxsurgery. 2aTreatment Outcome 0afluoroscopy 0aspinal arch external skeletal fixators 0amethodology1 aLewis, Daniel D.1 aCROSS, ALAN R.1 aSEREDA, COLIN W.0 tVeterinary surgery.g2007 July, v. 36, no. 5 p.442-448dBlackwell Publishing Incx0161-34997nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1532-950X.2007.00290.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20080521b20080606c00000000  aINDd4CTe2008/04/24  aOther US 7aarticle04271naa a2200757 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024004100133040001800174100001700192245015800209300001800367500002400385506007600409520175000485506003702235650002102272650002702293650001802320650001302338650001602351650001202367650001102379650001402390650002102404650001102425650001402436650001902450650001202469650002002481650002902501650002002530650001702550650001402567650001202581650005702593650001802650650004202668650002402710650004402734650000902778650002302787650002802810650004502838650002102883650001302904650005302917650007702970650006003047650002703107650001403134700001703148700002403165700002003189700002203209700001303231700002103244700002303265773011303288852000903401856009103410655001203501IND4369909120221207090731.0050514s2005    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436990912DNAL7 a158455022pmid7 aPMC10873652pmcid7 a10.1128/IAI.73.5.2958-2966.20052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPalma, Marco10aPseudomonas aeruginosa SoxR Does Not Conform to the Archetypal Paradigm for SoxR-Dependent Regulation of the Bacterial Oxidative Stress Adaptive Response  ap. 2958-2966.  aIncludes references  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aSoxR is a transcriptional regulator that controls an oxidative stress response in Escherichia coli. The regulator is primarily activated by superoxide anion-dependent oxidation. Activated SoxR turns on transcription of a single gene, soxS, which encodes a transcriptional regulator that activates a regulon that includes dozens of oxidative stress response genes. SoxR homologues have been identified in many bacterial species, including the opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa. However, the expected SoxR partner, SoxS, has not been found in P. aeruginosa. Thus, the primary gene target(s) of P. aeruginosa SoxR is unknown and the involvement of this regulator in the oxidative stress response of the bacterium remains unclear. We utilized transcriptome profiling to identify the P. aeruginosa SoxR regulon and constructed and characterized an unmarked P. aeruginosa [Delta]soxR mutant. We provide evidence indicating that P. aeruginosa SoxR activates a six-gene regulon in response to O₂[superscript ·-]-induced stress. The regulon includes three transcriptional units: (i) the recently identified mexGHI-ompD four-gene operon, which encodes a multidrug efflux pump system involved in quorum-sensing signal homeostasis; (ii) gene PA3718, encoding a probable efflux pump; and (iii) gene PA2274, encoding a probable monooxygenase. We also demonstrate that P. aeruginosa SoxR is not a key regulatory player in the oxidative stress response. Finally, we show that P. aeruginosa SoxR is required for virulence in a mouse model of intrapulmonary infection. These results demonstrate that the E. coli-based SoxRS paradigm does not hold in P. aeruginosa and foster new hypotheses for the possible physiological role of P. aeruginosa SoxR.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aEscherichia coli 3aPseudomonas aeruginosa 3aanimal models 3abacteria 3ahomeostasis 3amutants 3aoperon 3aoxidation 3aoxidative stress 3aoxygen 3apathogens 3aquorum sensing 3aregulon 3astress response 3atranscription (genetics) 3atranscriptomics 3atransporters 3avirulence 2aAnimals 2aBacterial Proteinsxchemistryxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aBase Sequence 2aGene Expression Regulation, Bacterial 2aHeat-Shock Response 2aLung Diseasesxmicrobiologyxmortality. 2aMice 2aMice, Inbred C57BL 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aOligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis. 2aOxidative Stress 2aProteome 2aPseudomonas Infectionsxmicrobiologyxmortality. 2aPseudomonas aeruginosaxgeneticsxmetabolismxpathogenicityxphysiology. 2aTranscription Factorsxchemistryxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aTranscription, Genetic 2aVirulence1 aZurita, Juan1 aFerreras, Julian A.1 aWorgall, Stefan1 aLarone, Davise H.1 aShi, Lei1 aCampagne, Fabien1 aQuadri, Luis E.

We have isolated AgArr1, an arrestin-encoding cDNA from the malaria vector mosquito, Anopheles gambiae, where olfaction is critical for vectorial capacity. Analysis of AgArr1 expression revealed an overlap between chemosensory and photoreceptor neurons. Furthermore, an examination of previously identified arrestins from Drosophila melanogaster exposed similar bimodal expression, and Drosophila arrestin mutants demonstrate impaired electrophysiological responses to olfactory stimuli. Thus, we show that arrestins in Drosophila are required for normal olfactory physiology in addition to their previously described role in visual signaling. These findings suggest that individual arrestins function in both olfactory and visual pathways in Dipteran insects; these genes may prove useful in the design of control strategies that target olfactory-dependent behaviors of insect disease vectors.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3amessenger RNA 3aneurons 3acomplementary DNA 3aelectroantennography 3abinding proteins 3agene expression 3asmell 3aAnopheles gambiae 3amutants 3anucleotide sequences 3agenes 3aelectrophysiology 3aDrosophila melanogaster 3aantennae 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aAnimals 2aAnophelesxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aArrestinsxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aDNA Primers 2aDrosophila melanogasterxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aEmbryo, Nonmammalianxphysiology 2aGene Expression Regulation, Developmental 2aGene Library 2aLarva 2aMalariaxtransmission 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aOlfactory Pathwaysxphysiology 2aPhosphoproteinsxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aReverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction 2aSequence Alignment 2aSequence Homology, Amino Acid 2aVision, Ocularxphysiology 0asense organs 0amolecular sequence data 0aagarr1 gene 0amaxillary palps1 aRiesgo-Escovar, J.1 aPitts, R.J.1 aKafatos, F.C.1 aCarlson, J.R.1 aZwiebel, L.J.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2002 Feb. 5, v. 99, no. 3 p.1633-1638x0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.0225054993Available from publisher's Web site  a20020903b20020909c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US 7aarticle03559naa a2200601 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002100111024003200132040001800164100001300182245013100195300001800326506007600344520135800420506003701778650002901815650002601844650002401870650001201894650002401906650003101930650001301961650002101974650002901995650003902024650001302063650001802076650002702094650005302121650005902174650003002233650005802263650001302321650003102334650002902365650002602394650004902420650003902469650003802508650006002546650003102606700001702637773014102654852000902795856008202804930003302886945001302919946001302932655001202945IND2328377320221207090742.0020806e20020205dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232837732DNAL7 a118185692pmid7 aPMC1221672pmcid7 a10.1073/pnas.0326812992doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, T.10aDynamic association of transcriptional activation domains and regulatory regions in Saccharomyces cerevisiae heat shock factor  ap. 1200-1205.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aIn Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the heat shock transcription factor (HSF) is thought to be a homotypic trimer that is bound to the promoters of heat shock protein (HSP) genes at both normal and heat shock temperatures. Exposure to heat shock greatly and rapidly induces HSF transcriptional activity without further increasing DNA-binding affinity. It is believed that HSF is under negative regulation at normal growth temperatures, but the detailed mechanism by which HSF is activated is still not clear. We report the analysis of mutations in a conserved arginine (residue 274) at the C-terminal end of the DNA-binding domain (DBD). Two mutations significantly increase both basal activity of HSF at normal temperatures and induced activity on heat shock. We demonstrate by coimmunoprecipitation experiments that the mutations reduce the association between the DNA-binding domain/oligomerization domain and the transcription activation domains. Our studies suggest that the DNA-binding domain of HSF can interact with activation domains directly, and this interaction is important for the repression of HSF activity under normal growth conditions. Destabilizing this interaction by heat or by mutations results in HSF transcriptional activation. We propose that Arg-274 is critical for intramolecular repression of HSF activity in normally growing cells.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3atranscription factors 3aDNA-binding domains 3amutants 3aheat shock proteins 3atranscriptional activation 3amutation 3apromoter regions 3atranscription (genetics) 2aAdenosine Triphosphatexmetabolism 2aArginine 2aBinding Sites 2aCross-Linking Reagents 2aCyclic AMP-Dependent Protein Kinasesxmetabolism 2aDNA-Binding Proteinsxchemistryxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aFungal Proteinsxgenetics 2aHeat-Shock Proteinsxchemistryxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aKinetics 2aMutagenesis, Site-Directed 2aPhosphorus Radioisotopes 2aRNA, Fungalxgenetics 2aRecombinant Proteinsxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aSaccharomyces cerevisiaexgenetics 2aSaccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins 2aTranscription Factorsxchemistryxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aTranscriptional Activation1 aParker, C.S.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2002 Feb. 5, v. 99, no. 3 p.1200-1205x0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.0326812993Available from publisher's Web site  a20020903b20020909c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US 7aarticle02548naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100002500171245009500196300001800291500002400309520126700333650002701600650001901627650002701646650001101673650001401684650001001698650001101708650002401719650002501743650001101768650001301779650001301792650001101805650001201816650001401828650002401842650005501866650001301921773010401934852000902038856005502047655001202102IND4398999020221119214728.0071216e200712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439899902DNAL7 a179448552pmid7 a10.1111/j.1365-294X.2007.03548.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBRADSHAW, COREY J.A.10aSwimming in the deep end of the gene pool: global population structure of an oceanic giant  ap. 5111-5113.  aIncludes references  aDespite the impression held by some that few biological mysteries remain, even evocative species such as humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae), white sharks (Carcharodon carcharias) and green turtles (Chelonia mydas) have poorly documented movement patterns, reproductive strategies and population dynamics despite years of dedicated research. This is largely due to the difficulty of observing wide-ranging marine species over the majority of their life cycle. The advent of powerful tracking devices has certainly improved our understanding, but it is usually only with molecular tools that the nature of population structure becomes apparent. In this issue of Molecular Ecology, Castro and colleagues have provided the first global-scale assessment of population structure for the largest fish -- whale sharks (Rhincodon typus). Whale sharks can reach lengths > 12 m and are a popular tourist attraction at places where they aggregate, yet for most of their life cycle, we know little indeed of where they go and how they interact with other populations. Previous tracking studies imply a high dispersal capacity, but only now have Castro and colleagues demonstrated high gene flow and haplotype diversity among the major ocean basins where they are found. 3aCarcharodon carcharias 3aChelonia mydas 3aMegaptera novaeangliae 3abasins 3agene flow 3agenes 3aoceans 3apopulation dynamics 3apopulation structure 3asharks 3aswimming 3atourists 3awhales 2aAnimals 2aGene Pool 2aPopulation Dynamics 2aSharksxanatomy & histologyxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aSwimming0 tMolecular ecology.g2007 Dec., v. 16, no. 24 p.5111-5113dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0962-10837nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-294X.2007.03548.x 7aarticle02505naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100001900154245005900173300001600232500036500248520122500613650001701838650001101855650001201866650001301878650002401891650001401915650001101929651001301940700001801953773014401971856005502115852000902170655001202179IND60540396520221119214802.0160819e20151001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054039652DNAL7 a10.17660/ActaHortic.2015.1103.412doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVinning, G.

Prices provide a vague measurement because the source of information varies. Furthermore, price margins vary along the chain and investment decisions in off-farm inputs are not made on the basis of margins. Nor does the reporting approach provide a road map for interventions to improve the efficiency of the chain. The reform approach used in Balochistan, Pakistan, has evolved through working on value chains for different agricultural products in countries in the Pacific and Asia. It uses a simple three-stage chain of “production”, “marketing”, and “the bit in the middle” that links the two with the clear intention of increasing returns to growers. Over twenty elements have been identified in the three stages that are applicable to a host of rural products in the horticultural, agricultural and livestock sub-sectors. The principle elements in each of the three stages are outlined along with their associated generic interventions to improve performance. A case study of the Balochistan grape industry is used to illustrate the usefulness of the reform approach. The approach has resulted in improved returns to growers of around 30%. 3acase studies 3agrapes 3agrowers 3aindustry 3ainformation sources 3alivestock 3aprices 3aPakistan1 aDoolan, D.

DRC measures the relative efficiency of domestic production in terms of its international cost competitiveness. It provides a comparison between the domestic costs to produce a given good with its value added at international prices. It compares the value of the non-tradable domestic resources used to produce one unit of the good with what the good would earn if it was exported. In this study the cost of table grape production was calculated by Manisa Viticulture Research Station's records from 2007 to 2012. Costs of inputs and prices of table grapes were obtained from various sources such as Turkish Statistical Institute, Aegean Exporters' Association and Ministry of Food, Agriculture and Livestock. Results show that Turkey has a competitive advantage in table grape production. 3ainput costs 3alivestock 3aprices 3atable grapes 3avalue added 3aviticulture0 tActa horticulturae.g2015 Oct. 1, , no. 1103 p.273-278dInternational Society for Horticultural Science.wJournal:jnl46289x0567-75727nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.17660/ActaHortic.2015.1103.40  aDNAL 7aarticle02280naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100001400154245008400168300001600252500036500268520084600633650003001479650002801509650002101537650001301558650002201571650001401593650001201607650001801619650001401637650002601651650001501677700001801692773014401710856005501854852000901909655001201918IND60540396120221119214720.0160819e20151001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054039612DNAL7 a10.17660/ActaHortic.2015.1103.372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRekhy, R.10aHow do we motivate the consumer to eat more nutrient rich fruit and vegetables?  ap. 257-260.  aPaper presented at the XXIX International Horticultural Congress on Horticulture: Sustaining Lives, Livelihoods and Landscapes (IHC2014): XVII International Symposium on Horticultural Economics and Management and V International Symposium on Improving the Performance of Supply Chains in the Transitional Economies held August 17-22, 2014, Brisbane, Austrialia  aFruit and vegetable consumption is important to combat chronic disease such as cardiovascular conditions, cancer and obesity. However, despite the established health benefits, daily intake levels remain much lower that the WHO recommend. A number of factors are known to impact fresh fruit and vegetable consumption. Taking these into account, a variety of promotional and policy interventions have been conducted around the globe for more than a decade to raise daily consumption levels. These campaigns have often been a joint effort between industry, government and public health organisations and this collaboration has contributed towards their effectiveness. The success of these initiatives has been modest in terms of meeting the WHO consumption targets, although most have been able to increase knowledge and awareness of the issue. 3aWorld Health Organization 3acardiovascular diseases 3achronic diseases 3aindustry 3aissues and policy 3aneoplasms 3aobesity 3apublic health 3araw fruit 3avegetable consumption 3avegetables1 aMcConchie, R.0 tActa horticulturae.g2015 Oct. 1, , no. 1103 p.257-260dInternational Society for Horticultural Science.wJournal:jnl46289x0567-75727nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.17660/ActaHortic.2015.1103.37  aDNAL 7aarticle03938naa a2200661 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146072000900164072000900173100002100182245010800203300001600311500002400327500001500351520196600366650002302332650001402355650001602369650001402385650002102399650001702420650002702437650002302464650001402487650001402501650001702515650001202532650002002544650002702564650001202591650001202603650001202615650002602627650005002653650002702703650003002730650004302760650001102803650002402814650002202838650002602860650002202886650001702908653002102925653001802946700002302964773011402987852000903101856008503110930003303195945002503228946001103253655001203264IND4392845020221119215117.0070702e200710  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439284502DNAL7 a172852442pmid7 a10.1007/s11259-007-0059-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL200 0aL2101 aSharma, G.

Cumulus oocyte complexes obtained from slaughterhouse ovaries were randomly divided into 6 groups: control (non-vitrified, matured for 24 h at 38 ± 1°C, 5% CO₂ in humidified air), and those matured for 0 h (vitrified before IVM) or 6, 12, 18 and 24 h before vitrification. Cumulus oocyte complexes were vitrified in solution consisting of 40% w/v propylene glycol and 0.25 mol/L trehalose in phosphate-buffered saline supplemented with 4% w/v bovine serum albumin. Vitrified cumulus oocyte complexes were stored at -196[composite function (small circle)]C (liquid nitrogen) for at least 7 days and then thawed at 37°C; cryoprotectant was removed with 1 mol/L sucrose solution. Cumulus oocyte complexes in the 0, 6, 12, 18 and 24 h groups were then matured for an additional 24, 18, 12, 6 and 0 h, respectively, to complete 24 h of IVM. Among the five vitrification groups, 89-92% of cumulus oocyte complexes were recovered, after warming, of which 84-91% were morphologically normal. Overall survivability of vitrified cumulus oocyte complexes was lower (p < 0.05) than that of non-vitrified cumulus oocyte complexes (94.5%). Survival rates of cumulus oocyte complexes matured 24 h prior to vitrification (61.3%) were higher (p < 0.05) than those matured for 12 h (46.7%), 6 h (40.6%) and 0 h (37.6%). Nuclear status following 24 h IVM was assessed. A higher proportion of non-vitrified (control) oocytes (72.7%) reached metaphase II (M-II) stage in control than oocytes vitrified for 24 h (60.0%), 18 h (54.4), 12 h (42.3%), 6 h (33.3%) and 0 h (31.6%) (p < 0.05). The results suggest that length of time in maturation medium prior to vitrification influences post-thaw survivability of buffalo oocytes; longer intervals resulted in higher survival rates. 3atemporal variation 3aviability 3acorrelation 3abuffaloes 3acryopreservation 3acell culture 3abiological development 3afreeze-thaw cycles 3aoogenesis 3ametaphase 3acell nucleus 3ameiosis 3aanimal breeding 3agermplasm conservation 3aoocytes 3afemales 2aAnimals 2aBuffaloesxphysiology 2aCell Culture Techniquesxmethodsxveterinary. 2aCell Nucleusxgenetics 2aCell Survivalxphysiology 2aCryopreservationxmethodsxveterinary. 2aFemale 2aMeiosisxphysiology 2aOocytesxcytology 2aOogenesisxphysiology 2aRandom Allocation 2aTime Factors 0aphase transition 0avitrification1 aLoganathasamy, K. 0 tVeterinary research communications.g2007 Oct., v. 31, no. 7 p.881-893dSpringer Netherlandsx0165-73807nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11259-007-0059-73Available from publisher's Web site  a20071029b20071102c00000000  aINDd4CTe2007/10/09  aNon-US 7aarticle02267naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001700152245013100169300001400300520109000314650002301404650002501427650001601452650001601468650002301484650002801507650001101535650001501546650001801561700001701579700001701596700001701613700001401630700001701644773010801661852000901769856009201778946001101870655001201881IND4446163920221119215019.0101208e201101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444616392DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1574-6968.2010.02139.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTao, Zhanhua10aMonitoring and rapid quantification of total carotenoids in Rhodotorula glutinis cells using laser tweezers Raman spectroscopy  ap. 42-48.  aRhodotorula glutinis is known to accumulate large amounts of carotenoids under certain culture conditions, which have very important industrial applications. So far, the molecular mechanism of regulating carotenogenesis is still not well understood. To better understand the carotenogenesis process, it requires methods that can detect carotenogenesis rapidly and reliably in single live cells. In this paper, a method based on laser tweezers Raman spectroscopy (LTRS) was developed to directly detect carotenoids, as well as other important biological molecules in single live R. glutinis cells. The data showed that the accumulation of carotenoids and lipids occurred mainly in the late exponential and stationary phases when the cell growth was inhibited by nutrient limitation. Meanwhile, the carotenoid concentration changed together with the concentration of nucleic acids, which increased in the first phase and decreased in the last phase of the culture. These data demonstrate that LTRS is a rapid, convenient, and reliable method to study the carotenogenesis process in vivo. 3aRaman spectroscopy 3aRhodotorula glutinis 3acarotenoids 3acell growth 3agrowth retardation 3aindustrial applications 3alipids 3amonitoring 3anucleic acids1 aWang, Guiwen1 aXu, Xiaodong1 aYuan, Yufeng1 aWang, Xue1 aLi, Yongqing0 tFEMS microbiology letters.g2011 Jan., v. 314, no. 1 p.42-48dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0378-10977nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1574-6968.2010.02139.x3Available from publisher's Web site  aNon-US 7aarticle03200naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024004100133040001800174100002100192245012500213300001800338500002400356506007600380520123700456506003701693650003101730650003101761650001401792650001701806650002001823650002101843650001001864650000901874650001201883650001401895650004301909650004301952650001101995650002302006650003502029650005402064650003602118650003802154650000902192650002302201650005902224650007202283700002202355700002302377700002102400773011302421852000902534856009102543655001202634IND4369908620221207094808.0050514s2005    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436990862DNAL7 a158454972pmid7 aPMC10873832pmcid7 a10.1128/IAI.73.5.2910-2922.20052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLazarevic, Vanja10aInduction of Mycobacterium tuberculosis-Specific Primary and Secondary T-Cell Responses in Interleukin-15-Deficient Mice  ap. 2910-2922.  aIncludes references  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aSeveral studies have provided evidence that interleukin-15 (IL-15) can enhance protective immune responses against Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection. However, the effects of IL-15 deficiency on the functionality of M. tuberculosis-specific CD4 and CD8 T cells are unknown. In this study, we investigated the generation and maintenance of effector and memory T-cell responses following M. tuberculosis infection of IL-15[superscript -/-] mice. IL-15[superscript -/-] mice had slightly higher bacterial numbers during chronic infection, which were accompanied by an increase in gamma interferon (IFN-[gamma])-producing CD4 and CD8 T cells. There was no evidence of increased apoptosis or a defect in proliferation of CD8 effector T cells following M. tuberculosis infection. The induction of cytotoxic and IFN-[gamma] CD8 T-cell responses was normal in the absence of IL-15 signaling. The infiltration of CD4 and CD8 T cells into the lungs of "immune" IL-15[superscript -/-] mice was delayed in response to M. tuberculosis challenge. These findings demonstrate that efficient effector CD4 and CD8 T cells can be developed following M. tuberculosis infection in the absence of IL-15 but that recall T-cell responses may be impaired.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aCD8-positive T-lymphocytes 3aMycobacterium tuberculosis 3aapoptosis 3acytotoxicity 3aimmune response 3ainterferon-gamma 3alungs 3amice 2aAnimals 2aApoptosis 2aCD4-Positive T-Lymphocytesximmunology 2aCD8-Positive T-Lymphocytesximmunology 2aHumans 2aImmunologic Memory 2aInterferon-gammaxbiosynthesis 2aInterleukin-15xdeficiencyxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aLungximmunologyxmicrobiology. 2aLymphocyte Activationximmunology 2aMice 2aMice, Inbred C57BL 2aMycobacterium tuberculosisximmunologyxpathogenicity. 2aTuberculosis, Pulmonaryximmunologyxmicrobiologyxphysiopathology.1 aYankura, David J.1 aDivito, Sherrie J.1 aFlynn, JoAnne L.0 tInfection and immunity.g2005 , v. 73, no. 5 p.2910-2922dAmerican Society for Microbiologyx0019-95677nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1128/IAI.73.5.2910-2922.20053Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02112naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127072000900145100002300154245005200177300001600229500002400245500001500269520092800284650002801212650002501240653001301265653003601278653002101314653001801335653001501353653001501368653001501383653001901398773013401417852000901551856008501560930003301645945002501678946001101703655001201714IND4392878620221119215115.0070702e200708  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439287862DNAL7 a10.1007/s10806-007-9039-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aP0001 aHickman, Larry A. 10aPragmatic Paths to Environmental Sustainability  ap. 365-373.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aAfter summarizing what I take to be the main contribution of Norton's book--his proposal for a new vocabulary for public discourse as it pertains to environmental stability--I attempt to locate his work among some of the current debates regarding sustainability and public policy. I detail some of the ways in which this work constitutes a further development of themes he presented in 1991 in Toward unity Among Environmentalists. I discuss his prescriptions for defusing confrontations regarding environmental policy by functionalizing issues in ways that cut across historically entrenched interest groups. From the standpoint of method, I argue that Norton has stacked a Habermas- type proceduralism on top of a pragmatic experimentalist platform (and I add that if he had constructed his method the other way around it would not have worked.) In all this I find Norton's proposals both imaginative and full of promise. 3asustainable development 3aenvironmental policy 0aideology 0aEnvironmental Protection Agency 0aenvironmentalism 0afunctionalism 0apragmatism 0aJohn Dewey 0anaturalism 0asustainability0 tJournal of agricultural and environmental ethics.g2007 Aug., v. 20, no. 4 p.365-373dKluwer Academic Publishersx1187-78637nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10806-007-9039-83Available from publisher's Web site  a20070806b20070902c00000000  aINDdRLGe2007/08/06  aNon-US 7aarticle03328naa a2200733 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146072000900164072000900173100001800182245014200200300001600342500002400358500001500382520108500397650002201482650001201504650001901516650002101535650001001556650001801566650002001584650001001604650001301614650001101627650002801638650002601666650003101692650002201723650000901745650001301754650002201767650001901789650002601808650001901834650004001853650001201893650004001905650002101945650005001966650006402016650003902080650003602119650001002155650003902165651001102204651001102215653001102226653001002237700001902247700001902266700002002285773011402305852000902419856008502428930003302513945002502546946001102571655001202582IND4392845120221119214942.0070702e200710  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439284512DNAL7 a172794632pmid7 a10.1007/s11259-007-3561-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF900 0aL8101 aMysterud, I. 10aSapogenin Levels in Narthecium ossifragum Plants and Ovis aries Lamb Faeces during Two Alveld Outbreaks in Møre og Romsdal, Norway, 2001  ap. 895-908.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThe proposal that saponins produced by the lily bog asphodel (Narthecium ossifragum) may be the direct cause of the hepatogenous photosensitization disease alveld seen in Norwegian lambs was investigated by comparing sapogenin levels in two control and two toxic pastures, and in faeces from lambs grazing the four pastures in the Halsa and Surnadal municipalities, Møre og Romsdal county, Norway. Generally similar levels of sapogenins, determined after hydrolysis of parent plant saponins, were found in Narthecium leaves collected in June/July 2001 from the two alveld outbreak areas and two nearby control areas. Differences in the median sapogenin levels determined for leaf samples in outbreak and control areas were not statistically significant. The total level of free and conjugated sapogenins in faeces recovered from the rectums of lambs grazing the outbreak and control pastures areas varied greatly. The results obtained do not support the hypothesis that a dose-response relationship exists between Narthecium saponin levels and the occurrence of alveld outbreaks. 3anatural toxicants 3agrazing 3asheep diseases 3adietary exposure 3alambs 3adose response 3arisk assessment 3afeces 3asaponins 3aleaves 3aepidemiological studies 3aquantitative analysis 3aphotosensitivity disorders 3adisease outbreaks 3abogs 3aetiology 3achemical analysis 3aliver diseases 3aNarthecium ossifragum 3awetland plants 2aMagnoliopsidaxchemistryxtoxicity. 2aAnimals 2aDioscoreaceaexchemistryxtoxicity. 2aFecesxchemistry 2aGas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometryxmethods 2aPhotosensitivity Disordersxchemically inducedxveterinary. 2aPlant Leavesxchemistryxtoxicity. 2aSapogeninsxanalysisxtoxicity. 2aSheep 2aSheep Diseasesxchemically induced 3aNorway 0aNorway 0aalveld 0asheep1 aFlåøyen, A. 1 aLoader, J.

While one would expect smallholder producers and traders to join modern supply chains at every opportunity, there is growing evidence to show that not all participants are willing to engage. Through open-ended interviews with banana traders, the unwillingness to participate in modern supply chains is based on perceived risk, additional workloads and a current state of comfort. Apart from that, as supermarkets still source bananas from the traditional market, there is no need for traditional retailers to switch as they can still participate in modern supply chains. 3abananas 3ainterviews 3arisk perception 3asupermarkets 3asupply chain1 aBatt, P.

Which traits help C. glabrata to adapt to this different environment? Which specific responses are crucial for its survival in the host? The main differences seem to include an extended repertoire of adhesin genes, high drug resistance, an enhanced ability to sustain prolonged starvation and adaptations of the transcriptional wiring of key stress response genes. Here, we discuss the properties of C. glabrata with a focus on the differences to related fungi.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aCandida glabrata 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3aadhesins 3adrug resistance 3afungi 3agenes 3ahosts 3ahumans 3apathogens 3astarvation 3astress response 3atranscription (genetics)1 aGabaldón, Toni.1 aSchüller, Christoph0 tFEMS microbiology letters.g2011 Jan., v. 314, no. 1 p.1-9dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0378-10977nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1574-6968.2010.02102.x3Available from publisher's Web site  aNon-US 7aarticle04088naa a2200781 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146072000900164072000900173100002100182245013500203300001600338500002400354500001500378520162400393650001302017650002102030650001702051650002002068650001802088650001702106650002902123650001002152650001302162650002002175650001302195650002702208650002602235650001902261650001902280650002202299650002102321650001402342650002602356650004602382650006602428650001202494650004402506650004002550650003502590650001102625650003002636650002902666650005302695650000902748650005702757650002202814650003002836650001702866650003802883653001002921653001602931653001502947700001802962700001902980700001802999773011403017852000903131856008503140930003303225945002503258946001103283655001203294IND4392844620221119214750.0070702e200710  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439284462DNAL7 a172942602pmid7 a10.1007/s11259-007-0049-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL800 0aL8101 aKinjavdekar, P. 10aClinicophysiological Effects of Spinally Administered Ketamine and Its Combination with Xylazine and Medetomidine in Healthy Goats  ap. 847-861.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThe study was conducted in 9 healthy adult goats of either sex, weighing 15-20 kg, to evaluate and compare the clinicophysiological effects of spinally administered ketamine alone and in combination with xylazine and medetomidine. Nine trials each of the three treatments were conducted randomly by injecting ketamine (2.5 mg/kg) (n = 9), ketamine and xylazine (2.5 mg/kg and 0.05 mg/kg) (n = 9) and ketamine and medetomidine (2.5 mg/kg and 10 μg/kg) (n = 9). The drugs were administered at the lumbosacral subarachnoid space under strict aseptic conditions. The treatments were evaluated on the basis of clinicophysiological, haematological, biochemical and haemodynamic observations. Ketamine produced mild to moderate analgesia of the hindquarters. Its combination with either xylazine or medetomidine produced complete analgesia of the hindquarters for 45-60 min. Ataxia was moderate in the ketamine group, whereas animals attained sternal recumbency in the combination groups. A moderate degree of sedation was recorded in the combination groups. Heart rate and respiratory rate depression in the combination groups and heart rate and respiratory rate stimulation in ketamine group were recorded. Haematological parameters decreased in all the groups. Increase in serum glucose, creatinine and urea nitrogen was recorded in all the groups. Serum electrolytes did not show any significant change. The results showed that the combination of ketamine with xylazine or medetomidine at these dose rates produced a comparable degrees of analgesia of hindquarters with transient and minimal cardiopulmonary side effects. 3aketamine 3aanalgesic effect 3ahemodynamics 3ablood chemistry 3anormal values 3amedetomidine 3acombination drug therapy 3agoats 3axylazine 3adrug evaluation 3asedation 3aphysiological response 3acardiovascular system 3adrug injection 3alimbs (animal) 3adrug interactions 3apharmacokinetics 3asedatives 2aAnalgesiaxveterinary 2aAnalgesia, Epiduralxmethodsxveterinary. 2aAnesthetics, Combinedxadministration & dosagexpharmacology. 2aAnimals 2aAtaxiaxchemically inducedxveterinary. 2aBlood Chemical Analysisxveterinary 2aBody Temperaturexdrug effects 2aFemale 2aGoatsxbloodxphysiology. 2aHeart Ratexdrug effects 2aKetaminexadministration & dosagexpharmacology. 2aMale 2aMedetomidinexadministration & dosagexpharmacology. 2aRandom Allocation 2aRespirationxdrug effects 2aTime Factors 2aXylazinexanalysisxpharmacology. 0aspine 0aanesthetics 0aanalgesics1 aSingh, G.

For this latter, a Cropscan, Inc. multi-spectral radiometer was used to automatically take a measurement every 1-1.5 m. Field images of the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) of both devices were compared in their capability estimating yield variability in a wheat field. An experimental field with three seeding densities and five nitrogen application rates was investigated. Every treatment had four repetitions, resulting in 60 plots of 12 m x 16 m. At harvest, yield variables of the plots (grain and straw yield (t/ha), dry matter content in grain and straw (t/ha), nitrogen in grain and straw (kg[N]/ha) and protein content (%) in grain) were collected to relate to the images of both systems. The NDVI of both measurement systems was well related to applied nitrogen in the field: correlation coefficients were 0.78 and 0.85 for the aerial-based and the ground-based system, respectively. There was a high similarity (correlation coefficient of 0.94) between NDVI measurements of both systems. NDVI was also well related to yield variables at harvest. The NDVI of the ground system was better related to yield variables at harvest compared to NDVI of the aerial system. Best correlation coefficient found for both systems was with nitrogen in grain: 0.84 and 0.91 for the aerial-based and the ground-based system, respectively. NDVI images were more related to yield quality. Grain yield already reached its optimum in the field, while grain quality still increased with increasing nitrogen application rate. For the ground system, the average estimation errors, when using linear regression analysis, were smaller than 10% for all yield variables except for estimated straw yield and estimated nitrogen content in straw. For the aerial system, also estimated total nitrogen content exceeded the 10% error percentage. Besides the higher accuracy in the estimation of yields variables, the ground system had the advantage of being cheaper and that the data were immediately available. 3aTriticum aestivum 3awinter wheat 3agrain yield 3aaerial photography 3aremote sensing 3aprediction 3ayield monitoring 3avegetation cover 3aplant density 3anitrogen fertilizers 3afertilizer rates 3awheat straw 3adry matter accumulation 3anitrogen content 3aprotein content 3acalibration 3acrop quality 3aestimation 3aregression analysis 3afield experimentation 3aspectral analysis 3aBelgium1 aVrindts, E.1 aDe Baerdemaeker, J.0 tEuropean journal of agronomy.g2006 Feb., v. 24, no. 2 p.87-94dGauthier-Villarsx1161-03017nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.eja.2005.05.0023electronic resource  a20061109b20061202c00000000  aINDd2CTe2006/10/20  aNon-US 7aarticle02999naa a2200661 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002500092040001800117100002000135245006800155300001600223500002300239500001500262520125600277650001401533650001401547650002001561650001401581650001301595650001901608650001901627650002101646650001101667650001101678650002801689650001001717650001701727650002301744650001401767650002601781650001401807650001001821650001101831650001101842650001101853650002601864650001301890650001401903650001501917650003501932651001701967653002201984653001102006653001002017653001502027653001302042653001702055700001702072773009502089852000902184856007502193930003302268945001302301946001102314655001202325IND2229911620221119213319.0010206e200003  onc|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND222991162DNAL7 a10.1139/x99-2292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMcQuattie, C.J.10aResponse of sugar maple (Acer saccharum) seedlings to manganese  ap. 456-467.  aSummary in French.  a2019-12-04  aLong-term research in north-central Pennsylvania has revealed high levels (>2000 ppm) of foliar Mn in seedlings and overstory sugar maples (Acer saccharum Marsh.). To determine thresholds for sensitivity of sugar maple to Mn, 4-week-old seedlings growing in sand were irrigated for 8 weeks with nutrient solution (pH 3.8) containing 0.1 (control), 5, 10, 20, 40, or 80 mg Mn/L. Seedling mortality occurred at 40 (92%) and 80 (100%) mg Mn/L. At lower Mn, seedling dry mass decreased with increasing Mn concentrations; root growth was inhibited more than shoot growth. Foliar concentrations of all mineral nutrients except P were significantly reduced by Mn. Symptoms of Mn toxicity included chlorosis and necrosis in leaves, darkened root tips, and loosening of outer cortical cells in roots. Cellular symptoms observed in Mn-treated seedlings (5 mg/L and higher) included irregularities in cell shape, increased vacuolation, and swollen mitochondria in root meristems; leaves showed discrete electron-dense areas in chloroplast thylakoid membranes, increased starch in mesophyll cells, and collapse of phloem in midveins. Investigation of potential Mn toxicity will require simulated field conditions to fully evaluate interactions with other factors. 3amanganese 3aroot tips 3anutrient excess 3aseedlings 3anecrosis 3aroot meristems 3aAcer saccharum 3aapplication rate 3ashoots 3astarch 3adry matter accumulation 3acells 3amitochondria 3anutrient solutions 3achlorosis 3abiological resistance 3amesophyll 3ashape 3aleaves 3acortex 3aphloem 3anutrient requirements 3atoxicity 3amortality 3athylakoids 3anutrient-nutrient interactions 3aPennsylvania 0amineral nutrition 0agrowth 0aroots 0ainhibition 0asymptoms 0achloroplasts1 aSchier, G.A.0 tCanadian journal of forest research =.g2000 Mar., v. 30, no. 3 p.456-467x0045-50677nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1139/x99-2293Available from publisher's Web site  a20060205b00000000c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US 7aarticle02764naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002500092040001800117100001800135245011100153300001600264500002300280500001500303520149500318650001901813650001501832650002401847650002801871650001701899650001301916650001701929650001601946650001401962650002001976651001901996653002402015653001602039653001102055700001602066773009502082852000902177856007502186930003302261945001302294946001102307655001202318IND2207171720221119213724.0001010e200001  onc|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220717172DNAL7 a10.1139/x99-1982doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWyckoff, P.H.10aPredicting tree mortality from diameter growth: a comparison of maximum likelihood and Bayesian approaches  ap. 156-167.  aSummary in French.  a2019-12-04  aEcologists and foresters have long noted a link between tree growth rate and mortality, and recent work suggests that interspecific differences in low growth tolerance is a key force shaping forest structure. Little information is available, however, on the growth-mortality relationship for most species. We present three methods for estimating growth-mortality functions from readily obtainable field data. All use annual mortality rates and the recent growth rates of living and dead individuals. Annual mortality rates are estimated using both survival analysis and a Bayesian approach. Growth rates are obtained from increment cores. Growth-mortality functions are fitted using two parametric approaches and a nonparametric approach. The three methods are compared using bootstrapped confidence intervals and likelihood ratio tests. For two example species, Acer rubrum L. and Cornus florida L., growth-mortality functions indicate a substantial difference in the two species' abilities to withstand slow growth. Both survival analysis and Bayesian estimates of mortality rates lead to similar growth-mortality functions, with the Bayesian approach providing a means to overcome the absence of long-term census data. In fitting growth-mortality functions, the nonparametric approach reveals that inflexibility in parametric methods can lead to errors in estimating mortality risk at low growth. We thus suggest that nonparametric fits be used as a tool for assessing parametric models. 3aCornus florida 3aestimation 3amathematical models 3ainterspecific variation 3agrowth rings 3adiameter 3aforest trees 3aAcer rubrum 3amortality 3astand structure 3aNorth Carolina 0aspecies differences 0agrowth rate 0agrowth1 aClark, J.S.0 tCanadian journal of forest research =.g2000 Jan., v. 30, no. 1 p.156-167x0045-50677nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1139/x99-1983Available from publisher's Web site  a20001204b20001212c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US 7aarticle02732naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002500092040001800117100002000135245010100155300001800256500002300274520132100297650001101618650002601629650001701655650002201672650001201694650002101706650001301727650001601740650001401756650002301770650001801793650001301811650002101824650001401845650002201859650001001881650001501891650001001906650001301916650001801929653001201947700001701959773009701976852000902073856007502082930003302157945001302190946001102203655001202214IND2268156220221119213651.0010404e200007  onc|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND226815622DNAL7 a10.1139/x00-0552doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHawkins, C.D.B.10aFrost hardiness, height, and dormancy of 15 short-day, nursery-treated interior spruce seed lots  ap. 1096-1105.  aSummary in French.  aFifteen seed lots, five each from natural-stand, seed-orchard, and full-sib collections, of interior spruce (Picea glauca (Moench) Voss, Picea engelmannii Parry ex Engelm., and their naturally occurring hybrids) were sown in February 1993. One half of each seed lot received an ambient photoperiod (control) treatment, while the other half got a blackout (short-day) treatment. All seedlings were grown under ambient photoperiod except during the 17 days of blackout. Frost hardiness assessments were done between July and May. Blackout treatment was effective in regulating height and promoting frost hardiness in all seed lots, particularly vigorous ones. Seed lots originating from high latitude or elevation were more frost hardy both at fall lift and spring planting. Full-sib seed lots from similar latitude displayed no elevational frost-hardiness trend. Blackout treatment promoted seedling dormancy (estimated with days to bud break) at lift, but it had little or no effect on dormancy at planting. Seedling dormancy and frost hardiness were acquired and lost differently, suggesting that they are independent physiological processes. Blackout treatment significantly reduced new roots at planting in all lots. This could retard early field performance and negate the apparent utility of blackout treatment. 3aheight 3aplant characteristics 3aPicea glauca 3aPicea engelmannii 3ahybrids 3afrost resistance 3adormancy 3aphotoperiod 3aseedlings 3aseasonal variation 3aplanting date 3alatitude 3aplant physiology 3aphenology 3adormancy breaking 3aroots 3aprovenance 3avigor 3aaltitude 3aseed orchards 0alifting1 aShewan, K.B.0 tCanadian journal of forest research =.g2000 July, v. 30, no. 7 p.1096-1105x0045-50677nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1139/x00-0553Available from publisher's Web site  a20010601b20010612c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US 7aarticle02589naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002500092040001800117100002000135245012400155300001400279520146400293650002301757650001201780650002201792650002201814650001301836650001101849650001401860650002401874653002201898653001501920700001501935700001701950773012001967852000902087856007502096930003302171946001102204655001202215IND4410908220221119213721.0081002s2008    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441090822DNAL7 a10.1071/MF071212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKanaiwa, Minoru10aEvaluating a seasonal, sex-specific size-structured stock assessment model for the American lobster, Homarus americanus  ap. 41-56.  aMany models of different complexities are developed for fisheries stock assessment, and yet few have been rigorously evaluated for their performance in capturing fisheries population dynamics. This causes confusion about when a model should be used or not in assessing fisheries resources. This is especially true for models with complex structures. The present study evaluated the performance of a seasonal, sex-specific and size-structured stock assessment model with respect to the temporal pattern of recruitment, observation errors associated with input data, process errors and violation of model assumptions for the American lobster Homarus americanus. Using an individual-based lobster simulator, a series of lobster fisheries with different characteristics were simulated and the model was applied to the simulated data to estimate key fisheries parameters. Estimated values were then compared with the true values in the simulated fisheries to evaluate the model's ability to capture the temporal trend in stock abundance, biomass and recruitment, and to identify factors that might result in model failure. Results show that this newly developed lobster stock assessment model performs well in capturing the dynamics of the lobster population under a wide range of conditions. Temporal trends in natural mortality and biased estimates of growth parameters posed the most serious problems. The present study shows the importance of model evaluation. 3aHomarus americanus 3abiomass 3afishery resources 3alobster fisheries 3alobsters 3amodels 3amortality 3apopulation dynamics 0amodel performance 0asimulation1 aChen, Yong1 aWilson, Carl0 tMarine & freshwater research.g2008, v. 59, no. 1 p.41-56dCollingwood, Victoria: CSIRO Publishingx1323-16507nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1071/MF071213Available from publisher's Web site  a20081002b20081101c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02806naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002400143245011600167300001600283520163200299650000901931650001601940650001601956650001901972650001301991650001202004650001802016650001402034650002402048700002102072700002202093700002202115700002202137773015302159856004402312856004602356961000902402852000902411655001202420IND60666694320221119213726.0190917e201909  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066669432DNAL7 a10.2460/ajvr.80.9.8852doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDickerson, Vanna M.10aAbdominal lymphatic drainage after thoracic duct ligation and cisterna chyli ablation in clinically normal cats  ap. 885-890.  aOBJECTIVE To characterize abdominal lymphatic drainage in cats after thoracic duct ligation (TDL) and cisterna chyli ablation (CCA). ANIMALS 7 purpose-bred research cats. PROCEDURES Baseline CT lymphangiography was performed. A popliteal lymph node was injected with iohexol, and images were acquired at 5-minute intervals for 15 minutes. Cats underwent TDL and CCA; methylene blue was used to aid in identifying lymphatic vessels. The CT lymphangiography was repeated immediately after and 30 days after surgery. All cats were euthanized and necropsied. RESULTS Results of baseline CT lymphangiography were unremarkable for all 7 cats. Only 5 cats completed the study. Leakage of contrast medium at the level of the cisterna chyli was seen on CT lymphangiography images obtained from all cats immediately after surgery. Evaluation of 30-day postoperative CT lymphangiography images revealed small branches entering the caudal vena cava in 2 cats, leakage of contrast medium into the caudal vena cava with no visible branches in 1 cat, and no contrast medium in the caudal vena cava in 2 cats. Contrast medium did not flow beyond the level of the cisterna chyli in any cat. Gross examination during necropsy revealed that all cats had small lymphatic vessels that appeared to connect to local vasculature identified in the region of the cisterna chyli. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE Abdominal lymphaticovenous anastomoses formed after TDL and CCA in cats. This would support use of these procedures for treatment of cats with idiopathic chylothorax, although additional studies with clinically affected cats are warranted. 3acats 3achylothorax 3alymph nodes 3amethylene blue 3anecropsy 3asurgery 3athoracic duct 3avena cava 3aveterinary medicine1 aGrimes, Janet A.1 aSecrest, Scott A.1 aWallace, Mandy L.1 aSchmiedt, Chad W.0 tAmerican journal of veterinary research.g2019 Sept., v. 80, no. 9 p.885-890dAmerican Veterinary Medical AssociationwJournal:1912x0002-96457nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2460/ajvr.80.9.88540uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/6666943  aUSDA  aDNAL 7aarticle02657naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002500092040001800117100001700135245008400152300001800236500002300254520139200277650001901669650001701688650002101705650001601726650001501742650001401757650002201771650001601793650002101809650001301830650002201843650001801865651001101883653001501894700001501909700001701924700002001941773009701961852000902058856007502067930003302142945001302175946001102188655001202199IND2322543120221119213704.0010815e200106  onc|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232254312DNAL7 a10.1139/x01-0422doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBergsten, U.10aFrost heaving in a boreal soil in relation to soil scarification and snow cover  ap. 1084-1092.  aSummary in French.  aVertical uplift of seedlings and rods on the soil surface and at a depth of 5 cm, and of reference trees, was monitored using a theodolite from autumn to spring in two adjacent field experiments on a silt soil in northern Sweden. Treatments involving scarification (control and square patches of 0.1, 0.2, 0.4, and 0.8 m at natural snow cover) and snow cover (simulated maximum cover, snow free, and natural cover for control and 0.4-m patches) were compared. For snow free and natural snow cover, diurnal variation of soil surface temperature, duration and magnitude of freezing temperatures, and uplift increased with patch size. At the end of the winter under natural snow cover, uplift of the soil surface and shallow soil was between 4.4 and 5.3 cm for the control treatment without scarification and the 0.1-m patch while the uplift for the 0.4- and 0.8-m patches reached 7.6-11.5 cm. The highest uplift value, 14.6 cm, was observed for the snow-free treatment with 0.4-m patches. Maximum uplift of trees averaged 4.4 cm, which was similar to values observed for seedlings and rods with an intact humus layer and a natural snow cover, indicating that the highest observed uplift was mainly due to needle and soil surface ice. In conclusion, size of the scarified area and duration and thickness of snow cover largely influence frost heaving of tree seedlings in a susceptible soil. 3aboreal forests 3aforest soils 3asite preparation 3afrost heave 3asoil depth 3aseedlings 3adiurnal variation 3asilty soils 3asoil temperature 3aduration 3aspatial variation 3aforest litter 3aSweden 0asnow cover1 aGoulet, F.1 aLundmark, T.1 aLofvenius, M.O.0 tCanadian journal of forest research =.g2001 June, v. 31, no. 6 p.1084-1092x0045-50677nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1139/x01-0423Available from publisher's Web site  a20010929b20011005c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US 7aarticle02544naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002500111040001800136100002100154245009300175300001600268500002300284500001500307520104800322650002701370650001201397650001501409650000901424650001401433650001501447650002701462650002201489650001201511650001201523650001601535650001201551650001201563650001101575650002101586650001601607650001101623650001301634650000901647650002701656650001501683653001301698700001801711700001801729700001201747773006601759852000901825856007501834930003301909945001301942946001101955655001201966IND2322201320221119213833.0010725e200104  onc|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232220132DNAL7 a113417282pmid7 a10.1139/g00-1182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPyatskowit, J.D.10aInheritance of microsatellite loci in the polyploid lake sturgeon (Acipenser fulvescens)  ap. 185-191.  aSummary in French.  a2019-12-04  aInheritance in the expression of amplicons for four microsatellite primer pairs was determined using 10 families created from gametes of wild lake sturgeon (Acipenser fulvescens). Loci Afu34 and Afu68 expressed a maximum of two even-intensity bands per individual and had progeny genotype ratios that fit disomic inheritance (P > 0.05). Some variation exhibited at Afu34 and Afu68 was attributable to a null allele. Genotype expression at both loci also indicated that one female parent had transmitted unreduced gametes. Primer Afu39 amplified products that exhibited four gene doses, where genotype counts fit expected ratios for disomic inheritance (P > 0.05) indicating amplification of products from two disomic loci that share alleles. Meiotic drive was evident at the Afu39 loci based on a test for random segregation (P < 0.05). Only the expression of Afu19 gave evidence of tetrasomic inheritance based on a single progeny potentially produced by a double reduction gamete.

OBJECTIVE: The objective was to determine whether a low-glycemic-load diet improves acne lesion counts in young males. DESIGN: Forty-three male acne patients aged 15-25 y were recruited for a 12-wk, parallel design, dietary intervention incorporating investigator-blinded dermatology assessments. The experimental treatment was a low-glycemic-load diet composed of 25% energy from protein and 45% from low-glycemic-index carbohydrates. In contrast, the control situation emphasized carbohydrate-dense foods without reference to the glycemic index. Acne lesion counts and severity were assessed during monthly visits, and insulin sensitivity (using the homeostasis model assessment) was measured at baseline and 12 wk. RESULTS: At 12 wk, mean (±SEM) total lesion counts had decreased more (P = 0.03) in the low-glycemic-load group (-23.5 ± 3.9) than in the control group (-12.0 ± 3.5). The experimental diet also resulted in a greater reduction in weight (-2.9 ± 0.8 compared with 0.5 ± 0.3 kg; P < 0.001) and body mass index (in kg/m²; -0.92 ± 0.25 compared with 0.01 ± 0.11; P = 0.001) and a greater improvement in insulin sensitivity (-0.22 ± 0.12 compared with 0.47 ± 0.31; P = 0.026) than did the control diet. CONCLUSION: The improvement in acne and insulin sensitivity after a low-glycemic-load diet suggests that nutrition-related lifestyle factors may play a role in the pathogenesis of acne. However, further studies are needed to isolate the independent effects of weight loss and dietary intervention and to further elucidate the underlying pathophysiologic mechanisms. 3alesions (animal) 3aglycemic index 3aepidemiology 3amen 3aenergy intake 3abody weight 3aacne 3adietary carbohydrate 3ainsulin resistance 3ahomeostasis 3apatients 3apathogenesis 3abody mass index 3adiet therapy 0adiet1 aMann, Neil J.1 aBraue, Anna1 aMäkeläinen, Henna1 aVarigos, George A.0 tAmerican journal of clinical nutrition.g2007 July, v. 86, no. 1 p.107-115dAmerican Society for NutritionwJournal:jnl45206x0002-91657nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.ajcn.org/contents-by-date.0.shtml3Available from publisher's Web site  a20080924b20081011c00000000  aINDd2CTe2007/10/20  aOther US 7aarticle03553naa a2200637 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111072000900129100002600138245008600164300001600250500002400266500001500290520162400305650001801929650002101947650001101968650002101979650001802000650002502018650004302043650001202086650001302098650002502111650001102136650002102147650003002168650002302198650005202221650002402273650001102297650001102308650004002319650001902359650000902378650001602387650003302403650002402436650002302460653002002483653002002503700001802523700002102541700002502562700002202587773012802609852000902737856008602746930003302832945002502865946001302890655001202903IND4392955720221119213459.0070708e200707  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439295572DNAL7 a176167712pmid  aAGLbengcAGL 0aT3001 aWilliams, Jennifer A.10aExtract of Salacia oblonga lowers acute glycemia in patients with type 2 diabetes  ap. 124-130.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aBACKGROUND: Two previous studies tested the efficacy of Salacia oblonga extract in healthy adults. OBJECTIVE: This study evaluated the effect of an herbal extract of Salacia oblonga on postprandial glycemia and insulinemia in patients with type 2 diabetes after ingestion of a high-carbohydrate meal. DESIGN: Sixty-six patients with diabetes were studied in this randomized, double-blinded crossover study. In a fasted state, subjects consumed 1 of the following 3 meals: a standard liquid control meal, a control meal + 240 mg Salacia oblonga extract, and a control meal + 480 mg Salacia oblonga extract. Serum glucose and insulin samples were measured at baseline and at postprandial intervals up to 180 min. RESULTS: Both doses of the Salacia extract significantly lowered the postprandial positive area under the glucose curve (14% for the 240 mg extract and 22% for the 480 mg extract) and the adjusted peak glucose response (19% for the lower dose and 27% for the higher dose of extract) to the control meal. In addition, both doses of the herbal extract significantly decreased the postprandial insulin response, lowering both the positive area under the insulin curve and the adjusted peak insulin response (14% and 9%, respectively, for the 240 mg extract; 19% and 12%, respectively, for the 480 mg extract) in comparison with the control meal. CONCLUSIONS: The extract of Salacia oblonga lowers acute glycemia and insulinemia in persons with type 2 diabetes after a high-carbohydrate meal. The results from this study suggest that Salacia may be beneficial to this population for postprandial glucose control. 3ablood glucose 3amedicinal plants 3adosage 3aherbal medicines 3ahyperglycemia 3adietary carbohydrate 3anoninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus 3ainsulin 3apatients 3amedicinal properties 3aadults 2aArea Under Curve 2aBlood Glucosexmetabolism 2aCross-Over Studies 2aDiabetes Mellitus, Type 2xbloodxdrug therapy. 2aDouble-Blind Method 2aFemale 2aHumans 2aHyperglycemiaxbloodxdrug therapy. 2aInsulinxblood 2aMale 2aMiddle Aged 2aPlant Extractsxpharmacology 2aPostprandial Period 2aSalaciaxchemistry 0aSalacia oblonga 0ablood chemistry1 aChoe, Yong S.1 aNoss, Michael J.1 aBaumgartner, Carl J.1 aMustad, Vikkie A.0 tAmerican journal of clinical nutrition.g2007 July, v. 86, no. 1 p.124-130dAmerican Society for Nutritionx0002-91657nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.ajcn.org/contents-by-date.0.shtml3Available from publisher's Web site  a20071108b20071210c00000000  aINDd2CTe2007/10/20  aOther US 7aarticle04357naa a2200769 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153072000900171072000900180100002400189245011600213300001600329500002400345500001500369520191200384650002502296650001702321650001902338650001702357650003902374650000902413650002202422650004202444650002202486650002002508650001902528650002902547650002202576650001102598650001202609650006102621650004102682650000902723650001102732650003702743650004702780650003502827650003202862650000902894650003902903650002002942650003202962650001502994650002103009650002603030650003403056650002203090653001803112653001503130653003803145700002503183700002203208700002203230700002403252700002503276773010203301852000903403856009203412930003303504945002503537946001303562655001203575IND4392935220221119213530.0070708e200707  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439293522DNAL7 a176149312pmid7 a10.1111/j.1532-950X.2007.00296.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL800 0aL8401 aLEVINE, JONATHAN M.10aEvaluation of the Success of Medical Management for Presumptive Cervical Intervertebral Disk Herniation in Dogs  ap. 492-499.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aTo determine the success of medical management of presumptive cervical disk herniation in dogs and variables associated with treatment outcome. Retrospective case series. Dogs (n=88) with presumptive cervical disk herniation. Dogs with presumptive cervical and thoracolumbar disk herniation were identified from medical records at 2 clinics and clients were mailed a questionnaire related to the success of therapy, clinical recurrence of signs, and quality of life (QOL) as interpreted by the owner. Signalment, duration and degree of neurologic dysfunction, and medication administration were determined from medical records. Ninety-seven percent of dogs (84/87) with complete information were described as ambulatory at initial evaluation. Successful treatment was reported for 48.9% of dogs with 33% having recurrence of clinical signs and 18.1% having therapeutic failure. Bivariable logistic regression showed that non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) administration was associated with success (P=.035; odds ratio [OR]=2.52). Duration of cage rest and glucocorticoid administration were not significantly associated with success or QOL. Dogs with less-severe neurologic dysfunction were more likely to have a successful outcome (OR=2.56), but this association was not significant (P=.051). Medical management can lead to an acceptable outcome in many dogs with presumptive cervical disk herniation. Based on these data, NSAIDs should be considered as part of the therapeutic regimen. Cage rest duration and glucocorticoid administration do not appear to benefit these dogs, but this should be interpreted cautiously because of the retrospective data collection and use of client self-administered questionnaire follow-up. These results provide insight into the success of medical management for presumptive cervical disk herniation in dogs and may allow for refinement of treatment protocols. 3aintervertebral disks 3adrug therapy 3adisease course 3adog diseases 3aperipheral nervous system diseases 3adogs 3amedical treatment 3anonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents 3aphysical activity 3aglucocorticoids 3acervical spine 3amusculoskeletal diseases 3afunctional status 3ahernia 2aAnimals 2aAnti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidalxtherapeutic use 2aDog Diseasesxdrug therapyxtherapy. 2aDogs 2aFemale 2aGlucocorticoidsxtherapeutic use 2aHerniaxdrug therapyxtherapyxveterinary. 2aIntervertebral Discxpathology 2aLumbar Vertebraexpathology 2aMale 2aNeurologic Examinationxveterinary 2aQuality of Life 2aSurveys and Questionnaires. 2aRecurrence 2aRestxphysiology 2aRetrospective Studies 2aThoracic Vertebraexpathology 2aTreatment Outcome 0ahealth status 0aneuropathy 0amusculoskeletal system physiology1 aLEVINE, GWENDOLYN J.1 aJOHNSON, SCOTT I.1 aKERWIN, SHARON C.1 aHETTLICH, BIANCA F.1 aFOSGATE, GEOFFREY T.0 tVeterinary surgery.g2007 July, v. 36, no. 5 p.492-499dBlackwell Publishing Incx0161-34997nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1532-950X.2007.00296.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20080521b20080606c00000000  aINDd4CTe2008/04/24  aOther US 7aarticle02861naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002500092040001800117100001600135245017800151300001600329520142300345650001401768650002501782650001301807650002601820650001901846650001301865650002001878650002301898650001401921650001401935650001101949650001001960650001101970650000901981651001401990653002402004653002002028653002102048700001802069700002302087700001902110773012202129852000902251856007502260930003302335946001102368655001202379IND4410909720221119213642.0081002s2008    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441090972DNAL7 a10.1071/MF070722doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMorris, Kay10aFloristic shifts in wetlands: the effects of environmental variables on the interaction between Phragmites australis (Common Reed) and Melaleuca ericifolia (Swamp Paperbark)  ap. 187-204.  aOver the past 40-50 years, the woody shrub Melaleuca ericifolia has progressively invaded large areas of Phragmites australis in Dowd Morass, a Ramsar-listed, brackish wetland in south-eastern Australia. To understand the processes underlying this shift we grew Phragmites and Melaleuca alone and together under contrasting sediment organic-matter loadings and salinities. To examine if the capacity of Phragmites to aerate the sediment influenced plant interactions, we also dissipated convective gas flow in some Phragmites plants by perforating their stems. Although Phragmites suppressed the growth of Melaleuca under all conditions, Melaleuca persisted. We did not find Phragmites ramets to be more sensitive to salinity than Melaleuca seedlings. Surprisingly Phragmites did not increase sediment redox and was more sensitive to increased organic-matter loading than Melaleuca. These results do not support the notion that colonisation by Melaleuca was facilitated by a decline in Phragmites at higher salinities or through aeration of the sediments by Phragmites. Seedlings of Melaleuca, however, were easily blown over by wind and it is likely that Phragmites stands shelter Melaleuca during establishment. Although our short-term experiment did not show that Melaleuca was a better competitor, differences in seasonal growth patterns may contribute to a shift in competitive abilities over a longer time scale. 3aMelaleuca 3aPhragmites australis 3aaeration 3aenvironmental factors 3aorganic matter 3asalinity 3aseasonal growth 3aseasonal variation 3asediments 3aseedlings 3ashrubs 3astems 3aswamps 3awind 3aAustralia 0aconvective gas flow 0aGippsland Lakes 0asoil oxygenation1 aBoon, Paul I.1 aRaulings, Elisa J.1 aWhite, Sean D.0 tMarine & freshwater research.g2008, v. 59, no. 3 p.187-204dCollingwood, Victoria: CSIRO Publishingx1323-16507nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1071/MF070723Available from publisher's Web site  a20081002b20081101c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03821naa a2200697 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111040001800133072000900151072000900160100002100169245016700190300001600357500002400373500001500397506007600412520156800488506003702056650002102093650003102114650001702145650002002162650002102182650001002203650001702213650001902230650002302249650001202272650002202284650002902306650001002335650001102345650002702356650003002383650005302413650001102466650003502477650003102512650004602543650003202589653002202621653001602643653002102659700001802680700001302698700002302711700001802734700002002752700002202772700002302794773012802817852000902945856008602954930003303040945002503073946001303098655001203111IND4392955220221207082455.0070708e200707  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439295522DNAL7 a176167682pmid7 aPMC26704852pmcid  aAGLbengcAGL 0aX380 0aT3001 aAlbu, Jeanine B.10aIndependent associations of insulin resistance with high whole-body intermuscular and low leg subcutaneous adipose tissue distribution in obese HIV-infected women  ap. 100-106.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: Obesity and insulin resistance are growing problems in HIV-positive (HIV+) women receiving highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). OBJECTIVE: The objective was to determine the contribution of adipose tissue (AT) enlargement and distribution to the presence of insulin resistance in obese HIV+ women. DESIGN: Whole-body intermuscular AT (IMAT), visceral AT (VAT), subcutaneous AT (SAT), and SAT distribution (leg versus upper body) were measured by whole-body magnetic resonance imaging. Insulin sensitivity (SI) was measured with an intravenous glucose tolerance test in obese HIV+ women recruited because of their desire to lose weight (n = 17) and in obese healthy controls (n = 32). RESULTS: The HIV+ women had relatively less whole-body SAT and more VAT and IMAT than did the controls (P < 0.05 for all). A significant interaction by HIV status was observed for the relation of total SAT with SI (P < 0.001 for the regression's slope interactions after adjustment for age, height, and weight). However, relations of IMAT, VAT, and SAT distribution (leg SAT as a percentage of total SAT; leg SAT%) with SI did not differ significantly between groups. For both groups combined, the best model predicting a low SI included significant contributions by both high IMAT and low leg SAT%, independent of age, height, and weight, and no interaction between groups was observed (overall r² = 0.44, P = 0.0003). CONCLUSION: In obese HIV+ women, high whole-body IMAT and low leg SAT% distribution are independently associated with insulin resistance.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3asubcutaneous fat 3amagnetic resonance imaging 3adrug therapy 3ablood chemistry 3aantiviral agents 3awomen 3avisceral fat 3aHIV infections 3ainsulin resistance 3aobesity 3aglucose tolerance 2aAbdominal Fatxpathology 2aAdult 2aFemale 2aGlucose Tolerance Test 2aHIVxgrowth & development 2aHIV Infectionsxmetabolismxpathologyxvirology. 2aHumans 2aInsulin Resistancexphysiology 2aMagnetic Resonance Imaging 2aObesityxmetabolismxpathologyxvirology. 2aSubcutaneous Fatxpathology 0aintermuscular fat 0abody weight 0abody composition1 aKenya, Sonjia1 aHe, Qing1 aWainwright, Marsha1 aBerk, Evan S.1 aHeshka, Stanley1 aKotler, Donald P.1 aEngelson, Ellen S.0 tAmerican journal of clinical nutrition.g2007 July, v. 86, no. 1 p.100-106dAmerican Society for Nutritionx0002-91657nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.ajcn.org/contents-by-date.0.shtml3Available from publisher's Web site  a20071109b20071210c00000000  aINDd2CTe2007/10/20  aOther US 7aarticle02793naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002500092040001800117100001900135245007400154300001600228500002300244500001500267520151300282650001301795650000901808650002201817650002701839650002001866650001601886650001401902650002301916650002101939650002201960650001201982651001001994651001202004651001202016651001102028653001002039653001102049700001502060773009502075852000902170856007502179930003302254945001302287946001102300655001202311IND2322379420221119213743.0010803e200103  onc|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232237942DNAL7 a10.1139/x00-1732doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMencuccini, M.10aLeaf/sapwood area ratios in Scots pine show acclimation across Europe  ap. 442-456.  aSummary in French.  a2019-12-04  aWe tested the hypothesis that leaf/sapwood area ratios (S) in Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) differ across Europe. Data from published records were collected and critically reviewed, and five new sites were studied to increase the overall sample size available for analyses. For seven studies for which data were available, we also determined the magnitude of the errors resulting from the use of ratio and regression-type estimators during subsampling for leaf areas of individual trees. These subsampling errors were then compared with those resulting from least square regressions of leaf area against sapwood area, and the total error was determined. Finally, correlation analysis was used to test for significant relationships between S and site-specific and stand-specific variables. Subsampling for leaf area resulted in errors, the magnitude of which was site specific and depended on sampling sizes and protocols. In general, despite larger total errors resulting from accounting for subsampling, significant differences were found among S, both at breast height and at the base of the living crown, at least for the most extreme cases. Significant negative relationships were found between S and summer vapour pressure deficit and maximum summer temperature. Although preliminary, our results confirm previous suggestions about climatic effects on Scots pine leaf/sapwood area ratios by enlarging the analysis to a wider range of European sites and by including genetic variability across stands. 3adiameter 3aarea 3arelative humidity 3ageographical variation 3aair temperature 3aacclimation 3aleaf area 3aseasonal variation 3aPinus sylvestris 3agenetic variation 3asapwood 3aItaly 3aEngland 3aFinland 0aEurope 0acrown 0aerrors1 aBonosi, L.0 tCanadian journal of forest research =.g2001 Mar., v. 31, no. 3 p.442-456x0045-50677nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1139/x00-1733Available from publisher's Web site  a20010929b20011005c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US 7aarticle03206naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003000111040001800141100001600159245013700175300001600312500002300328500001500351520159400366650004501960650002202005650002102027650002302048650001302071650002302084650002002107650002302127650001702150650002002167650002002187650002502207650004602232653002502278653001802303700001202321700001402333700001502347700001602362700001402378700001302392700001902405700001602424773006602440852000902506856008002515930003302595945001302628946001102641655001202652IND2322202120221119213631.0010725e200104  onc|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232220212DNAL7 a113417312pmid7 a10.1139/gen-44-2-2132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGedil, M.A.13aAn integrated restriction fragment length polymorphism - amplified fragment length polymorphism linkage map for cultivated sunflower  ap. 213-221.  aSummary in French.  a2019-12-04  aRestriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) maps have been constructed for cultivated sunflower (Helianthus annuus L.) using three independent sets of RFLP probes. The aim of this research was to integrate RFLP markers from two sets with RFLP markers for resistance gene candidate (RGC) and amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) markers. Genomic DNA samples of HA370 and HA372, the parents of the F2 population used to build the map, were screened for AFLPs using 42 primer combinations and RFLPs using 136 cDNA probes (RFLP analyses were performed on DNA digested with EcoRI, HindIII, EcoRV, or DraI). The AFLP primers produced 446 polymorphic and 1101 monomorphic bands between HA370 and HA372. The integrated map was built by genotyping 296 AFLP and 104 RFLP markers on 180 HA370 x HA372 F2 progeny (the AFLP marker assays were performed using 18 primer combinations). The HA370 x HA372 map comprised 17 linkage groups, presumably corresponding to the 17 haploid chromosomes of sunflower, had a mean density of 3.3 cM, and was 1326 cM long. Six RGC RFLP loci were polymorphic and mapped to three linkage groups (LG8, LG13, and LG15). AFLP markers were densely clustered on several linkage groups, and presumably reside in centromeric regions where recombination is reduced and the ratio of genetic to physical distance is low. Strategies for targeting markers to euchromatic DNA need to be tested in sunflower. The HA370 x HA372 map integrated 14 of 17 linkage groups from two independent RFLP maps. Three linkage groups were devoid of RFLP markers from one of the two maps. 3arestriction fragment length polymorphism 3aHelianthus annuus 3agenetic distance 3achromosome mapping 3agenotype 3alinkage (genetics) 3agenetic markers 2aChromosome Mapping 2aGenes, Plant 2aGenetic Linkage 2aGenetic Markers 2aHelianthusxgenetics 2aPolymorphism, Restriction Fragment Length 0agenetic polymorphism 0agene location1 aWye, C.1 aBerry, S.1 aSegers, B.1 aPeleman, J.1 aJones, R.1 aLeon, A.1 aSlabaugh, M.B.1 aKnapp, S.J.0 tGenome =.g2001 Apr., v. 44, no. 2 p.213-221x0831-27967nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1139/gen-44-2-2133Available from publisher's Web site  a20010903b20010910c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US 7aarticle02765naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002100111024003200132040001800164100001900182245006800201300001800269506007600287520117500363506003701538650001701575650002201592650002001614650001301634650001901647650001501666650001701681650001201698650001401710650001401724650002501738650003401763650002301797650001301820651001701833651001601850653001301866653002701879700001901906700001901925773014101944852000902085856008202094930003302176945001302209946001302222655001202235IND2328377920221207081727.0020806e20020205dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232837792DNAL7 a118185252pmid7 aPMC1222012pmcid7 a10.1073/pnas.0224472992doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBertness, M.D.10aAnthropogenic modification of New England salt marsh landscapes  ap. 1395-1398.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aSalt marshes play a critical role in the ecology and geology of wave-protected shorelines in the Western Atlantic, but as many as 80% of the marshes that once occurred in New England have already been lost to human development. Here we present data that suggest that the remaining salt marshes in southern New England are being rapidly degraded by shoreline development and eutrophication. On the seaward border of these marshes, nitrogen eutrophication stimulated by local shoreline development is shifting the competitive balance among marsh plants by releasing plants from nutrient competition. This shift is leading to the displacement of natural high marsh plants by low marsh cordgrass. On the terrestrial border of these same marshes, shoreline development is also precipitating the invasion of the common reed, Phragmites, by means of nitrogen eutrophication caused by the removal of the woody vegetation buffer between terrestrial and salt marsh communities. As a consequence of these human impacts, traditional salt marsh plant communities and the plants and it animals that are dependent on these habitats are being displaced by monocultures of weedy species.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3asalt marshes 3acommunity ecology 3awater pollution 3anitrogen 3aeutrophication 3aPhragmites 3aurbanization 2aEcology 2aEcosystem 2aGeography 2aNitrogenxmetabolism 2aPlant Physiological Phenomena 2aPlantsxmetabolism 2aSeawater 3aRhode Island 0aNew England 0ainvasion 0ashore line development1 aEwanchuk, P.J.1 aSilliman, B.R.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2002 Feb. 5, v. 99, no. 3 p.1395-1398x0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.0224472993Available from publisher's Web site  a20020903b20020909c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US 7aarticle03257naa a2200757 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003000111040001800141100001900159245007500178300001600253500002300269500001500292520091800307650001401225650003001239650002401269650001301293650002301306650002501329650002001354650002301374650001801397650002501415650002101440650001201461650003501473650002401508650001201532650002301544650002301567650002501590650004001615650002101655650003001676650003101706650003401737650001101771650002801782650003401810650001401844650003601858650004201894650005201936650002301988650003402011650005002045653002802095653001002123653003702133653002202170653002702192653001802219700001802237700002002255773006602275852000902341856008002350930003302430945001302463946001102476655001202487IND2324475120221119213543.0011214e200106  onc|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232447512DNAL7 a114447052pmid7 a10.1139/gen-44-3-4552doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBrunelli, J.P.10aAncient and recent duplications of the rainbow trout Wilms' tumor gene  ap. 455-462.  aSummary in French.  a2019-12-04  aThe Wilms' tumor suppressor (WT1) gene plays an important role in the development and functioning of the genitourinary system, and mutations in this gene are associated with nephroblastoma formation in humans. Rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) is one of the rare animal models that readily form nephroblastomas, yet trout express three distinct WT1 genes, one of which is duplicated and inherited tetrasomically. Sequence analyses suggest an ancient gene duplication in the common ancestor of bony fishes resulted in the formation of two WT1 gene families, that conserve the splicing variations of tetrapod WT1, and a second duplication event occurred in the trout lineage. The WT1 genes of one family map to linkage groups 6 and 27 in the trout genome map. Reverse transcribed polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) expression analysis demonstrated little difference in WT1 tissue expression pattern between genes. 3aneoplasms 3apolymerase chain reaction 3aOncorhynchus mykiss 3amutation 3alinkage (genetics) 3aamino acid sequences 3agene expression 3achromosome mapping 3aanimal models 3anucleotide sequences 3amultigene family 2aAlleles 2aAlternative Splicingxgenetics 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aAnimals 2aChromosome Mapping 2aCloning, Molecular 2aEvolution, Molecular 2aFish Diseasesxgeneticsxpathology. 2aGene Duplication 2aGene Expression Profiling 2aGenes, Duplicatexgenetics 2aGenes, Wilms Tumorxgenetics. 2aHumans 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aOncorhynchus mykissxgenetics 2aPhylogeny 2aPolymorphism, Geneticxgenetics 2aRNA, Messengerxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aReverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction 2aSequence Alignment 2aSequence Homology, Amino Acid 2aWilms Tumorxgeneticsxpathologyxveterinary. 0amolecular sequence data 0agenes 0agenetic techniques and protocols 0aurogenital system 0ainheritance (genetics) 0agene location1 aRobison, B.D.1 aThorgaard, G.H.0 tGenome =.g2001 June, v. 44, no. 3 p.455-462x0831-27967nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1139/gen-44-3-4553Available from publisher's Web site  a20020204b20020208c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US 7aarticle02067naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002500111040001800136100001500154245011000169300001600279500002300295520074400318650002201062650001601084650001501100650001601115650002301131650001501154650001201169650002301181650002401204650003201228650002201260650001601282650002401298653001101322653001601333700001501349700002601364773006601390852000901456856007501465930003301540945001301573946001101586655001201597IND2323515420221119213542.0011016e200108  onc|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232351542DNAL7 a115509112pmid7 a10.1139/g01-0352doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLeitao, A.10aEvidence of differential chromosome loss in aneuploid karyotypes of the Pacific oyster, Crassostrea gigas  ap. 735-737.  aSummary in French.  aThe G-banding technique was performed on aneuploid karyotypes from gill tissue of the Pacific oyster, Crassostrea gigas, to assess whether chromosome losses could be explained by differential chromosomal susceptibility and to clarify the negative correlation between aneuploidy and growth rate previously reported in different populations of this oyster. The study of 95 G-banded aneuploid karyotypes showed that only 4 of the 10 chromosome pairs (viz. 1, 5, 9, and 10) of C. gigas were affected by the loss of one homologous chromosome. Pairs 1, 9, and 10, which were lost in 56, 33, and 44% of cases, respectively, may be considered to be differentially affected.

This vaccine candidate was previously found to be well tolerated and immunogenic in volunteers. This article reports a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial conducted to test short-term protection conferred by 638 against subsequent V. cholerae infection and disease in volunteers in Cuba. A total of 45 subjects were enrolled and assigned to receive vaccine or placebo. The vaccine contained 10⁹ CFU of freshly harvested 638 buffered with 1.3% NaHCO₃, while the placebo was buffer alone. After vaccine but not after placebo intake, 96% of volunteers had at least a fourfold increase in vibriocidal antibody titers, and 50% showed a doubling of at least the lipopolysaccharide-specific immunoglobulin A titers in serum. At 1 month after vaccination, five volunteers from the vaccine group and five from the placebo group underwent an exploratory challenge study with 10⁹ CFU of [Delta]CTX[Phi] attenuated mutant strain V. cholerae 81. Only two volunteers from the vaccine group shed strain 81 in their feces, but none of them experienced diarrhea; in the placebo group, all volunteers excreted the challenge strain, and three had reactogenic diarrhea. An additional 12 vaccinees and 9 placebo recipients underwent challenge with 7 x 10⁵ CFU of virulent strain V. cholerae 3008 freshly harvested from a brain heart infusion agar plate and buffered with 1.3% NaHCO₃. Three volunteers (25%) from the vaccine group and all from the placebo group shed the challenge agent in their feces. None of the 12 vaccinees but 7 volunteers from the placebo group had diarrhea, and 2 of the latter exhibited severe cholera (>5,000 g of diarrheal stool). These results indicate that at 1 month after ingestion of a single oral dose (10⁹ CFU) of strain 638, volunteers remained protected against cholera infection and disease provoked by the wild-type challenge agent V. cholerae 3008. We recommend that additional vaccine lots of 638 be prepared under good manufacturing practices for further evaluation.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aClostridium thermocellum 3aVibrio cholerae 3ablood serum 3acholera 3adiarrhea 3aendo-1,4-beta-glucanase 3afeces 3agenes 3ahemagglutinins 3aimmunoglobulins 3aingestion 3amutants 3aproteinases 3avaccination 3avirulent strains 2aAdministration, Oral 2aAdolescent 2aAdult 2aAntibodies, Bacterialxblood 2aBacteriophagesxgenetics 2aCellulasexgenetics 2aCholeraxprevention & control 2aCholera Vaccinesxadministration & dosagexgeneticsximmunology. 2aClostridium thermocellum 2aDouble-Blind Method 2aFecesxmicrobiology 2aGene Deletion 2aHemagglutininsxgenetics 2aHumans 2aMale 2aPeptide Hydrolasesxgenetics 2aVaccination 2aVaccines, Attenuatedxadministration & dosagexgeneticsximmunology. 2aVibrio choleraexgeneticsximmunologyxpathogenicityxvirology.1 aJidy, Manuel Díaz1 aGarcía, Hilda1 aRodríguez, Boris L.1 aFernández, Roberto.1 aAño, Gemma1 aCedré, Bárbara1 aValmaseda, Tania1 aSuzarte, Edith1 aRamírez, Margarita.1 aPino, Yadira1 aCampos, Javier1 aMenéndez, Jorge.1 aValera, Rodrigo1 aGonzalez, Daniel.1 aGonzález, Irma.1 aPérez, Oliver1 aSerrano, Teresita1 aLastre, Miriam1 aMiralles, Fernando1 adel Campo, Judith1 aMaestre, Jorge Luis1 aPérez, José Luis.1 aTalavera González, Jorge Arturo.1 aPérez, Antonio.1 aMarrero, Karen1 aLedón, Talena1 aFando, Rafael0 tInfection and immunity.g2005 , v. 73, no. 5 p.3018-3024dAmerican Society for Microbiologyx0019-95677nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1128/IAI.73.5.3018-3024.20053Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02434naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002500092040001800117100001700135245011500152300001800267500002300285500001500308520119100323650002801514650001701542650001501559650001801574650001401592650001201606651001801618653002401636653001401660653001801674653001501692653001501707700002001722700001901742773009801761852000901859856007501868930003301943945001301976946001101989655001202000IND2327149120221119213639.0020521e200110  onc|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232714912DNAL7 a10.1139/x01-1082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aManies, K.L.10aAssessing large-scale surveyor variability in the historic forest data of the original U.S. Public Land Survey  ap. 1719-1730.  aSummary in French.  a2019-12-04  aThe U.S. General Land Office Public Land Survey (PLS) records are a valuable resource for studying pre-European settlement vegetation. However, these data were taken for legal, not ecological, purposes. In turn, the instructions the surveyors followed affected the data collected. For this reason, it has been suggested that the PLS data may not truly represent the surveyed landscapes. This study examined the PLS data of northern Wisconsin, U.S.A., to determine the extent of variability among surveyors. We statistically tested for differences among surveyors in recorded tree species, size, location, and distance from the survey point. While we cannot rule out effects from other influences (e.g., environmental factors), we found evidence suggesting some level of surveyor bias for four of five variables, including tree species and size. The PLS data remain one of the best records of pre-European settlement vegetation available. However, based on our findings, we recommend that projects using PLS records examine these data carefully. This assessment should include not only the choice of variables to be studied but also the spatial extent at which the data will be examined. 3ainterspecific variation 3aforest trees 3alandscapes 3aplant ecology 3adatabases 3aforests 3aUnited States 0aspecies differences 0asurveying 0apublic domain 0avegetation 0aevaluation1 aMladenoff, D.J.1 aNordheim, E.V.0 tCanadian journal of forest research =.g2001 Oct., v. 31, no. 10 p.1719-1730x0045-50677nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1139/x01-1083Available from publisher's Web site  a20020630b20020705c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US 7aarticle01793naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002500092040001800117100001500135245012800150300001800278500002300296500001500319520059600334650002200930650002200952650001100974650001700985650002001002650001201022651001001034651001201044651001301056653002201069700001501091700002301106773011301129852000901242856007501251930003301326945001301359946001101372655001201383IND2327150420221119213501.0020521e200110  onc|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232715042DNAL7 a10.1139/x01-1182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEnglin, J.14aThe dynamic path of recreational values following a forest fire: a comparative analysis of states in the Intermountain West  ap. 1837-1844.  aSummary in French.  a2019-12-04  aThis analysis examines the dynamic path of recreational values following a forest fire in three different states in the intermountain western United States. The travel cost demand analysis found that annual recreation values after a fire follow a highly nonlinear intertemporal path. The path is S-shaped, providing a range of benefits and losses in the years following a fire. While the results discourage the use of a single value throughout the Intermountain West, they do provide a range of likely values that public land managers can apply to fire-affected areas in their jurisdictions. 3aforest recreation 3acosts and returns 3atravel 3aforest fires 3aland management 3aforests 3aIdaho 3aWyoming 3aColorado 0aeconomic analysis1 aLoomis, J.1 aGonzalez-Caban, A.0 tCanadian journal of forest research.g2001 Oct., v. 31, no. 10 p.1837-1844wJournal:jnl2003x0045-50677nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1139/x01-1183Available from publisher's Web site  a20020630b20020705c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US 7aarticle03086naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153072001700171100003300188245009000221300001600311500002400327520138500351650000901736650001801745650001201763650002001775650001201795650004601807650000901853650001101862650004001873650005101913650005601964650000902020650002002029650003002049650002602079650003202105650003202137700002202169700001902191773013102210852000902341856009202350856005502442930003302497945002502530946001302555655001202568IND4392766720221119213549.0070701e200707  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439276672DNAL7 a176916362pmid7 a10.1111/j.1740-8261.2007.00256.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aVALDÉS-MARTÍNEZ, ALEJANDRO10aAssociation between renal hypoechoic subcapsular thickening and lymphosarcoma in cats  ap. 357-360.  aIncludes references  aThe purpose of this study was to investigate the association between renal hypoechoic subcapsular thickening observed ultrasonographically and the presence of renal lymphosarcoma in cats. The ultrasonography database was retrospectively searched for cats that underwent ultrasound examination and ultrasound guided needle renal aspirate, renal biopsy, or necropsy. One radiologist unaware of the final diagnosis evaluated the images for the presence of hypoechoic subcapsular thickening and other abnormal findings. Fifty-four cats met the inclusion criteria. Hypoechoic subcapsular thickening was found in 21 cats of which 17 had lymphosarcoma; the remaining four cats had a different diagnosis. Eleven out of 33 cats without hypoechoic subcapsular thickening were positive for lymphosarcoma, and the rest had a different diagnosis. There was a significant association between hypoechoic subcapsular thickening and renal lymphosarcoma (P=0.001). The positive predictive value of hypoechoic subcapsular thickening for lymphosarcoma was 80.9% and the negative predictive value was 66.7%. The sensitivity and specificity of hypoechoic subcapsular thickening for the diagnosis of renal lymphosarcoma were 60.7% and 84.6%, respectively. The results of this study indicate that the presence of hypoechoic subcapsular thickening in feline kidneys is associated with renal lymphosarcoma. 3acats 3alymphosarcoma 3akidneys 3aultrasonography 2aAnimals 2aCat Diseasesxpathologyxultrasonography. 2aCats 2aFemale 2aKidneyxpathologyxultrasonography. 2aKidney Neoplasmsxultrasonographyxveterinary. 2aLymphoma, Non-Hodgkinxultrasonographyxveterinary. 2aMale 2aMedical Records 2aPredictive Value of Tests 2aRetrospective Studies 2aSensitivity and Specificity 2aUltrasonographyxveterinary1 aCIANCIOLO, RACHEL1 aMai, Wilfried.0 tVeterinary radiology & ultrasound.g2007 , v. 48, no. 4 p.357-360dBlackwell Publishing IncwJournal:jnl48671x1058-81837nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1740-8261.2007.00256.x3Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1740-8261.2007.00256.x  a20070824b20070902c00000000  aINDdDFXe2007/08/24  aOther US 7aarticle03093naa a2200673 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153072000900171100002100180245007800201300001600279500002400295500001500319520100600334650001601340650002001356650002201376650001001398650001301408650001701421650002501438650000901463650001501472650001901487650004401506650001701550650000901567650001701576650001901593650001301612650001001625650005201635650001201687650006901699650004001768650000901808650002801817650001101845650005901856650006801915653001301983653002801996653001802024700002402042700001902066700002402085700002202109773010602131852000902237856009202246930003302338945002502371946001102396655001202407IND4392763220221119213422.0070701e200708  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439276322DNAL7 a176104932pmid7 a10.1111/j.1365-3164.2007.00595.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL8401 aMarconato, Laura10aParaneoplastic alopecia associated with hepatocellular carcinoma in a cat  ap. 267-271.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aA 15-year-old spayed female domestic shorthair cat presented with alopecia associated with hepatocellular carcinoma. Clinical signs, which had commenced 6 months previously, included loss of appetite, loss of weight, and depression. As reported by the owner, the cat developed alopecia a week before referral. The hair loss was localized to the ventral aspect of the thorax and abdomen, medial aspect of front and hind limbs, and ventral aspect of the tail, and was associated with histological features consistent with paraneoplastic alopecia. At necropsy, multiple hepatic nodules were observed, and subsequent histopathological investigation showed cords and sheets of hepatocyte-like neoplastic cells positive for the hepatocyte marker (Hep Par 1), thereby demonstrating the hepatocellular origin of the tumour, which was diagnosed as a hepatocellular carcinoma. This is the first report of feline paraneoplastic alopecia associated with hepatocellular carcinoma confirmed by the Hep Par 1 marker. 3ahepatocytes 3aultrasonography 3adisease diagnosis 3aliver 3ahepatoma 3abody regions 3aimmunohistochemistry 3acats 3abiomarkers 3adisease course 3asigns and symptoms (animals and humans) 3acat diseases 3apets 3acase studies 3ahistopathology 3aalopecia 3ahairs 2aAlopeciaxcomplicationsxdiagnosisxveterinary. 2aAnimals 2aCarcinoma, Hepatocellularxcomplicationsxdiagnosisxveterinary. 2aCat Diseasesxdiagnosisxpathology. 2aCats 2aDiagnosis, Differential 2aFemale 2aLiver Neoplasmsxcomplicationsxdiagnosisxveterinary. 2aParaneoplastic Syndromesxcomplicationsxdiagnosisxveterinary. 0aetiology 0aparaneoplastic alopecia 0acomplications1 aAlbanese, Francesco1 aViacava, Paolo1 aMarchetti, Veronica1 aAbramo, Francesca0 tVeterinary dermatology.g2007 Aug., v. 18, no. 4 p.267-271dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0959-44937nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-3164.2007.00595.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20071030b20071102c00000000  aINDd4CTe2007/10/14  aNon-US 7aarticle03274naa a2200661 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153072000900171100002000180245009900200300001600299500002400315500001500339520126900354650002001623650001301643650002101656650001801677650000901695650001101704650002701715650002201742650001101764650002901775650002201804650001501826650001701841650002301858650001201881650005601893650000901949650001101958650003201969650005802001650000902059650001502068650006202083651002502145653000902170653002602179653002102205653001502226653001502241700002002256700002302276700002502299773010602324852000902430856009202439930003302531945002502564946001102589655001202600IND4392763420221119213223.0070701e200708  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439276342DNAL7 a176104952pmid7 a10.1111/j.1365-3164.2007.00592.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL8311 aColombo, Silvia10aPrevalence of Malassezia spp. yeasts in feline nail folds: a cytological and mycological study  ap. 278-283.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aMalassezia spp. yeasts are commensal organisms of mammal and avian skin, but little is known about their presence on the skin of healthy cats. The purposes of this study were to evaluate the prevalence of Malassezia spp. yeasts in feline nail folds and to identify the different species. Forty-six cats of different breeds were evaluated by cytological examination, and Malassezia spp. yeasts were seen in 61% of them. Yeasts were found in 100% of Devon Rex cats [mean 8.63/oil immersion field (high-power field - HPF)]. Conversely, only 42% of cats of other breeds (domestic short-haired and Persian) were positive (mean 0.59/HPF). Twenty-one cats of different breeds were subsequently evaluated by fungal culture. Malassezia pachydermatis was isolated from 52%, M. furfur from 38%, and M. sympodialis from 9.5% of the cats. More than one species was observed in eight of 21 cats, six of which were Devon Rex. Malassezia spp. yeasts are common inhabitants of feline nail folds, especially in Devon Rex cats, and the presence of a high number of yeasts on cytology correlates with the clinical observation of brown, greasy material in the nail folds. M. pachydermatis and two lipid-dependent species were isolated from both Devon Rex cats and cats of other breeds. 3ain vivo studies 3amycology 3ain vitro culture 3anormal values 3acats 3ayeasts 3amicrobial colonization 3aMalassezia furfur 3abreeds 3aMalassezia pachydermatis 3aspecies diversity 3aprevalence 3acell biology 3anails (integument) 2aAnimals 2aCat Diseasesxepidemiologyxetiologyxmicrobiology. 2aCats 2aFemale 2aHoof and Clawxmicrobiology 2aMalasseziaxclassificationxisolation & purification. 2aMale 2aPrevalence 2aTinea Versicolorxepidemiologyxmicrobiologyxveterinary. 0aItalyxepidemiology. 0askin 0aDevon Rex (cat breed) 0anails (primates) 0aMalassezia 0aintegument1 aNardoni, Simona1 aCornegliani, Luisa1 aMancianti, Francesca0 tVeterinary dermatology.g2007 Aug., v. 18, no. 4 p.278-283dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0959-44937nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-3164.2007.00592.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20071029b20071102c00000000  aINDd4CTe2007/10/14  aNon-US 7aarticle04103naa a2200709 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002000111024003200131040001800163100001700181245018400198300001800382506007600400520170200476506003702178650001302215650002202228650001902250650002702269650002202296650002502318650002502343650001502368650001202383650002502395650001502420650001402435650001802449650007702467650002402544650001202568650001802580650005102598650003302649650003602682650004202718650002702760650001502787650001202802650002802814650003002842650002802872650003602900650002702936650001302963653001602976653002802992700001703020700001703037700001803054700001703072773014203089852000903231856008203240930003303322945001303355946001303368655001203381IND2322140720221207092341.0010721e20010605dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232214072DNAL7 a113811312pmid7 aPMC344022pmcid7 a10.1073/pnas.1211727982doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZagnitko, O.13aAn isoleucine/leucine residue in the carboxyltransferase domain of acetyl-CoA carboxylase is critical for interaction with aryloxyphenoxypropionate and cyclohexanedione inhibitors  ap. 6617-6622.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  acDNA fragments encoding the carboxyltransferase domain of the multidomain plastid acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACCase) from herbicide-resistant maize and from herbicide-sensitive and herbicide-resistant Lolium rigidum were cloned and sequenced. A Leu residue was found in ACCases from herbicide-resistant plants at a position occupied by Ile in all ACCases from sensitive grasses studied so far. Leu is present at the equivalent position in herbicide-resistant ACCases from other eukaryotes. Chimeric ACCases containing a 1000-aa fragment of two ACCase isozymes found in a herbicide-resistant maize were expressed in a yeast ACC1 null mutant to test herbicide sensitivity of the enzyme in vivo and in vitro. One of the enzymes was resistant/tolerant, and one was sensitive to haloxyfop and sethoxydim, rendering the gene-replacement yeast strains resistant and sensitive to these compounds, respectively. The sensitive enzyme has an Ile residue, and the resistant one has a Leu residue at the putative herbicide-binding site. Additionally, a single Ile to Leu replacement at an equivalent position changes the wheat plastid ACCase from sensitive to resistant. The effect of the opposite substitution, Leu to Ile, makes Toxoplasma gondii apicoplast ACCase resistant to haloxyfop and clodinafop. In this case, inhibition of the carboxyltransferase activity of ACCase (second half-reaction) of a large fragment of the Toxoplasma enzyme expressed in Escherichia coli was tested. The critical amino acid residue is located close to a highly conserved motif of the carboxyltransferase domain, which is probably a part of the enzyme active site, providing the basis for the activity of fop and dim herbicides.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aZea mays 3aTriticum aestivum 3aLolium rigidum 3aacetyl-CoA carboxylase 3acomplementary DNA 3anucleotide sequences 3aamino acid sequences 3aisoleucine 3aleucine 3aherbicide resistance 3asethoxydim 3ahaloxyfop 3abinding sites 2aAcetyl-CoA Carboxylasexantagonists & inhibitorsxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aAnimals 2aBinding Sites 2aCarboxyl and Carbamoyl Transferasesxchemistry 2aCyclohexanonesxpharmacology 2aEnzyme Inhibitorsxpharmacology 2aHerbicidesxmetabolismxpharmacology. 2aInsecticide Resistance 2aIsoleucine 2aLeucine 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPropionatesxpharmacology 2aPyridinesxpharmacology 2aStructure-Activity Relationship 2aToxoplasmaxenzymology 2aZea mays 0areplacement 0amolecular sequence data1 aJelenska, J.1 aTevzadze, G.1 aHaselkorn, R.1 aGornicki, P.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2001 June 5, v. 98, no. 12 p.6617-6622x0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1211727983Available from publisher's Web site  a20010903b20010910c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US 7aarticle02635naa a2200637 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024004100133040001800174100001500192245016000207300001800367500002400385506007600409520043500485506003700920650003100957650001200988650001701000650002301017650000901040650001101049650001701060650001301077650000901090650001201099650002301111650004601134650003501180650005301215650004201268650001101310650003501321650002801356650002101384650001301405650005401418650004801472650000901520650009101529650004301620650001401663700001201677700001901689700001501708700001701723700001801740700001401758773011301772852000901885856009101894655001201985IND4369912020221207081728.0050514s2005    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436991202DNAL7 a158455312pmid7 aPMC10873192pmcid7 a10.1128/IAI.73.5.3188-3191.20052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Hualin10aConversion of Staphylococcus epidermidis Strains from Commensal to Invasive by Expression of the ica Locus Encoding Production of Biofilm Exopolysaccharide  ap. 3188-3191.  aIncludes references  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aTo test if biofilm formation in Staphylococcus epidermidis is dependent on the polysaccharide intercellular adhesin, whose biosynthesis is driven by the ica locus, a plasmid containing the ica locus was transferred to three ica-negative strains.

  1 aMagani, I.E.10aFusarium oxysporum and post-emergence herbicide for the control of the parasitic plant Striga hermonthica in maize  ap. 1023-1032.  a2019-12-04  aTwo trials were conducted to evaluate the efficacy of a granular mycoherbicide formulation based on Fusarium oxysporum and post-emergence herbicide for the control of the parasitic plant, Striga hermonthica in the Nigerian Savanna. Four fungal treatments were used: F. oxysporum followed by 2,4-D, F. oxysporum followed by supplementary hoe weeding, F. oxysporum followed by Triclopyr and a control (No F. oxysporum but hoe-weeded). The experiments were laid out in a split plot design with three replications in the two locations. The two varieties (Across 97 TZL and farmer's local variety) formed the main plot treatments, while the Striga fungal treatments formed the sub-plot treatments. At the Lafia location, the emergence of Striga was delayed by 7 days (46 days) as compared to the Makurdi location, which germinated earlier 39 days after sowing. Maize variety Across 97 TZL similarly delayed the time to Striga emergence when compared to the farmer's local variety. However, the different Striga control methods did not have any significant effect on the time of Striga emergence. Generally, number of maize plants infected with Striga was highest with the farmer's local variety throughout the period of observation, while in the Striga control treatments, hoe-weeded check recorded the highest; the minimum was obtained with plots treated with F. oxysporum followed by postemergence application of Triclopyr at the rate of 0.36 kg a.i./ha at 6 weeks after sowing. Highest maize grain yields were obtained at Lafia with Across 97 TZL and plots treated with F. oxysporum followed by either post-emergence 2,4-D or Triclopyr at 0.36 kg a.i./ha each. The results demonstrate the high potentiality of using F. oxysporum as a spot application at planting followed by post-emergence herbicide (2,4-D or Triclopyr) application at 6 weeks after sowing for the control of the parasitic plant S. hermonthica in the Nigerian Savanna. 3aintegrated weed management 3afield experimentation 3a2,4-D 3amanual weed control 3abiological control agents 3aStriga hermonthica 3agrain yield 3apostemergent weed control 3amycoherbicides 3aparasitic plants 3aZea mays 3aFusarium oxysporum 3acorn 3aweeds 3aseedling emergence 3abiological control 3atriclopyr 3aseed germination 3agrain crops 3aNigeria 0aherbicides1 aIbrahim, A.q(Abdelwahid),d1933-1 aAvav, T.0 tBiocontrol science and technology.g2009, v. 19, no. 9-10 p.1023-1032x0958-31577nnas  aDNAL  a20100301b20100305c00000000  aINDd2CTe2010/02/08  aNon-US 7aarticle01901naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004100092024002200133024001900155040001800174100002700192245019300219300001800412500002400430506007600454520049100530506003701021650003601058650003101094650002401125650001601149650001201165650001401177650001501191650001401206650001401220700002301234700003301257773011301290852000901403856009101412655001201503IND4369911420221207094949.0050514s2005    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436991142DNAL7 a10.1128/IAI.73.5.3160-3163.20052doi7 aPMC10873502pmcid7 a158455252pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLavigne, Jean-Philippe10aRequirement of MgtC for Brucella suis Intramacrophage Growth: a Potential Mechanism Shared by Salmonella enterica and Mycobacterium tuberculosis for Adaptation to a Low-Mg²⁺ Environment  ap. 3160-3163.  aIncludes references  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aA Brucella suis mgtC mutant is defective for growth within macrophages and in low-Mg²⁺ medium.

The fact that these systems are highly homologous implies that novel antibacterial agents that chemically attenuate the pathogens via a specific interaction with the type III secretion mechanism can be identified. A number of small organic molecules having this potential have recently been identified (A. M. Kauppi, R. Nordfelth, H. Uvell, H. Wolf-Watz, and M. Elofsson, Chem. Biol. 10:241-249, 2003). Using different reporter gene constructs, we showed that compounds that belong to a class of acylated hydrazones of different salicylaldehydes target the TTS system of Yersinia pseudotuberculosis. One of these compounds, compound 1, was studied in detail and was found to specifically block Yop effector secretion under in vitro conditions by targeting the TTS system. In this respect the drug mimics the well-known effect of calcium on Yop secretion. In addition, compound 1 inhibits Yop effector translocation after infection of HeLa cells without affecting the eukaryotic cells or the bacteria. A HeLa cell model that mimics in vivo conditions showed that compound 1 chemically attenuates the pathogen to the advantage of the eukaryotic cell. Thus, our results show proof of concept, i.e., that small compounds targeting the TTS system can be identified, and they point to the possible use of TTS inhibitors as a novel class of antibacterial agents.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3asecretion 3aantibiotics 3acalcium 3aeukaryotic cells 3amodels 3acytosol 3atype III secretion system 3areporter genes 3aYersinia pseudotuberculosis 3abacteria 2aAcylation 2aAldehydesxmetabolism 2aBacterial Outer Membrane Proteinsxantagonists & inhibitorsxgeneticsxmetabolismxsecretion. 2aGene Expression Regulation, Bacterial 2aHeLa Cells 2aHumans 2aHydrazonesxchemistryxmetabolismxpharmacology. 2aProtein Transportxdrug effects 2aVirulence 2aYersinia pseudotuberculosisxdrug effectsxgeneticsxmetabolismxpathogenicity. 0aType III secretion system1 aKauppi, A.

Somatic embryogenic calli were induced from ginger shoot tips on solid MS medium with half the concentration of NH₄NO₃ and supplemented with 1.0 mg l-¹ 2,4-Dichloroacetic acid (2, 4-D) and 0.2 mg l-¹ Kin. Rapid-growing and well-dispersed suspension cultures were established by subculturing the embryogenic calli in the same liquid medium. Protoplasts were isolated from embryogenic suspensions with an enzyme solution composed of 4.0 mg l-¹ cellulase, 1.0 mg l-¹ macerozyme, 0.1 mg l-¹ pectolyase, 11% mannitol, 0.5% CaCl₂ and 0.1% 2-(N-morpholino) ethane sulphonic acid (MES) for 12-14 h at 27°C with a yield of 6.27 x 10⁶ protoplasts g-¹ fresh weight. The protoplasts were cultured initially in liquid MS medium with 1.0 mg l-¹ 2, 4-D and 0.2 mg l-¹ Kin. Then the protoplast-derived calli (1.5 cm²) were transferred to a basal MS medium containing 0.2 mg l-¹ 2, 4-D, 5.0 mg l-¹ benzyladenine (BA), 3% sucrose and 0.7% agar. The white somatic embryos were transferred to MS medium lacking growth regulators for shoot development. Shoots developed into complete plantlets on a solid MS medium supplemented with 2.0 mg l-¹ BA and 0.6 mg l-¹ α-Naphthaleneacetic acid (NAA). In addition, the effects of AgNO₃, activated charcoal (AC) and ascorbic acid (AA) on browning of protoplast-derived calli are discussed. 3amedicinal plants 3abenzyladenine 3amannitol 3amicropropagation 3asulfonates 3a2,4-D 3acallus 3ashoots 3apectin lyase 3adose response 3aexplants 3anaphthaleneacetic acid 3ain vitro regeneration 3aZingiber officinale 3akinetin 3acalcium chloride 3asucrose 3acellulases 3aculture media 3aprotoplasts 3asomatic embryogenesis 0amethodology 0ain vitro culture 0aMurashige and Skoog medium1 aBai, Jinhe1 aZhang, Zhenxian0 tPlant cell, tissue, and organ culture.g2007 May, v. 89, no. 2-3 p.151-157dKluwer Academic Publishersx0167-68577nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11240-007-9223-63Available from publisher's Web site  a20071019b20071102c00000000  aINDdMKSe2007/10/19  aNon-US 7aarticle02488naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127072000900145072000900154100002500163245010200188300001600290500002400306500001500330520120600345650001601551650002101567650001201588650001701600650001601617650001601633650001701649650002101666650001901687650001801706653001601724700002701740773012401767852000901891856008501900930003301985945002502018946001102043655001202054IND4393050420221119212914.0070715e200705  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439305042DNAL7 a10.1007/s11240-007-9222-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF600 0aF1101 aIqbal, Mohamed C.

Temperature stress treatments have generally been confined to a single temperature regime (above or below ambient) lasting from a few hours to days. We introduced a gradient with two temperature pulses (30 s each) in the stress application on anthers of Datura metel L. by stepping the temperature up and down for a total period of 60 s. Anthers were immersed in sterile water preheated and cooled to the desired temperature and cultured on Nitsch medium. The temperature pulse gradient significantly improved androgenesis compared to single temperature treatments, resulting in increased mean embryogenesis of 128% over control for 45°/15°C, 110% for 45°/10°C, 113% for 40°/10°C and 96% for 45°/5°C. The 45°/10°C gradient also significantly increased the number of dividing microspores observed, after 14 days of anther culture. Besides the differential of the gradient, the temperature limit was important, with anthers not tolerating temperatures beyond 45°C. The temperature pulse gradient applied at an early stage of culture may increase the window of competency of microspores for androgenesis. 3atemperature 3ain vitro culture 3aanthers 3aandrogenesis 3aheat stress 3amicrospores 3aDatura metel 3amicropropagation 3aheat treatment 3aculture media 0amethodology1 aWijesekara, Kolitha B.0 tPlant cell, tissue, and organ culture.g2007 May, v. 89, no. 2-3 p.141-149dKluwer Academic Publishersx0167-68577nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11240-007-9222-73Available from publisher's Web site  a20071019b20071102c00000000  aINDdMKSe2007/10/19  aNon-US 7aarticle02796naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003200092024002000124024001900144040001800163100001500181245021200196300001800408500001500426506007600441520120200517506003701719650002501756650000901781650002501790650001001815650002101825650001701846650001201863650001801875653001601893653003201909700001601941700001601957700001801973700001401991700001702005773014202022852000902164856008202173930003302255945001302288946001302301655001202314IND2321511720221207080702.0010613e20010522dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232151172DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.1011190982doi7 aPMC334802pmcid7 a113538192pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBerger, A.10aAnandamide and diet: inclusion of dietary arachidonate and docosahexaenoate leads to increased brain levels of the corresponding N-acylethanolamines in piglets.

Previously, we found these compounds to be active biologically when administered per os in large quantities to mice. In the present work, piglets were fed diets with and without 20:4n-6 and 22:6n-3 fatty acid precursors of NAEs, in levels similar to those found in porcine milk, during the first 18 days of life, and corresponding brain NAEs were assessed. In piglets fed diets containing 20:4n-6 and 22:6n-3, there were increases in several biologically active NAEs in brain homogenates-20:4n-6 NAE (4-fold), 20:5n-3 NAE (5-fold), and 22:5n-3 and 22:6n-3 NAE (9- to 10-fold). These results support a mechanism we propose for dietary long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids influences on brain biochemistry with presumed functional sequelae. This paradigm will enable targeted investigations to determine whether and why specific populations such as infants, elderly, or persons suffering from certain clinical conditions may benefit from dietary long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3achemical composition 3adiet 3adocosahexaenoic acid 3abrain 3aarachidonic acid 3aethanolamine 3apiglets 3aphospholipids 0aderivatives 0apolyunsaturated fatty acids1 aCrozier, G.1 aBisogno, T.1 aCavaliere, P.1 aInnis, S.1 aDi Marzo, V.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2001 May 22, v. 98, no. 11 p.6402-6406x0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1011190983Available from publisher's Web site  a20011101b20011108c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US 7aarticle02282naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110100001200127245007900139300002000218520126500238650002101503650001401524650001901538650002101557650002001578651001201598700002301610700002401633700002601657700002101683700002301704773011301727852000901840930003301849945002501882946001301907655001201920IND4430864020221119213314.0100107e200911  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443086402DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aXu, Nan10aEstrogen Concentration Affects its Biodegradation Rate in Activated Sludge  ap. 2263–2270.  aThe effect of concentration on the biodegradation rate of the steroid estrogens, estrone (E1) and 17-α-ethinylestradiol (EE2), was studied in batch and continuous-flow reactor systems using fresh activated sludge from two sewage treatment plants. Between the concentrations of 0.03 and 10 µg/L in the batch system, no consistent difference was found in the biodegradation rates for either estrogen. The biodegradation half-life was 0.3 to 0.7 h for E1 and 1.5 to 4.4 h for EE2 at 15 to 20°C. However, at 100 µg/L, biodegradation rates for both estrogens decreased, with the half-life prolonged to approximately 2.5 h for E1 and 12 to 18 h for EE2. In continuous-flow experiments, over a 2-h residence time, 95% of E1 and 48% of EE2 were removed on average at 0.1 µg/L while 52% of E1 and 20% of EE2 were removed at 100 µg/L. In general, spiking concentration of estrogens did not appear to affect biodegradation rates between the nanogram per liter to low microgram per liter levels in activated sludge; however, the rates greatly slowed when the concentration increased up to 100 µg/L. The results suggest activated sludge biodegradation studies with estrogens in the high microgram per liter levels could give misleading results and should be avoided. 3aactivated sludge 3aestrogens 3abiodegradation 3asewage treatment 3asewage effluent 3aEngland1 aJohnson, Andrew C.1 aJürgens, Monika D.1 aLlewellyn, Neville R.1 aHankins, Nick P.1 aDarton, Richard C.0 tEnvironmental toxicology and chemistry.g2009 Nov., v. 28, no. 11 p.2263–2270-2263–2270x0730-72687nnas  aDNAL  a20100121b20100205c00000000  aINDdGAYe2010/01/21  aOther US 7aarticle02664naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127072001700144100002200161245011300183300002000296500001500316520139100331650001601722650002701738650001101765650001501776650001701791650001901808650001601827650002101843650001401864651001401878653001101892700002201903700002601925700002101951700002101972700002001993773011302013852000902126930003302135945002502168946001302193655001202206IND4430864420221119213251.0100107e200911  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443086442DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aHedrick, David B.10aEffects of Diesel and Interactions with Copper and Other Metals in an Estuarine Sediment Microbial Community  ap. 2289–2297.  a2019-12-04  aEstuarine sediment microcosms were treated with combinations of diesel, copper (at two levels), and a mixture of heavy metals (mercury, cadmium, lead, and chromium; at two levels) mimicking the contaminant loadings found in harbor sediments. The effects on the microbial community were monitored by polar lipid fatty acid analysis. Diesel addition increased microbial biomass, caused shifts in some fatty acid structural groups, and decreased starvation biomarkers. Incorporation of diesel hydrocarbons into lipids was expressed as an increase in the proportion of odd-carbon-number fatty acids. No treatment with the metals mixture (mercury, cadmium, lead, and chromium) alone significantly changed any parameter derived from the polar lipid fatty acids, but the increase in microbial biomass from diesel addition was higher with the metals mixture, possibly because of indirect effects caused by reductions in grazing resulting from metal-induced toxicity to bacteriovorous nematodes. Copper also modified the effects of diesel addition, preventing biomass increase but not diesel degradation, suggesting that some of the energy gained from diesel oxidation was expended combating copper toxicity. In the present study, observations indicate that metals in general, and copper in particular, can modify the response of sedimentary microorganisms to petroleum-hydrocarbon contaminants. 3afatty acids 3asediment contamination 3acopper 3abiomarkers 3aheavy metals 3amicroorganisms 3adiesel fuel 3amarine sediments 3aestuaries 3aLouisiana 0alipids1 aPeacock, Aaron D.1 aTita, G.q(Guglielmo)1 aFleeger, John W.1 aCarman, Kevin R.1 aWhite, David C.0 tEnvironmental toxicology and chemistry.g2009 Nov., v. 28, no. 11 p.2289–2297-2289–2297x0730-72687nnas  aDNAL  a20100121b20100205c00000000  aINDdGAYe2010/01/21  aOther US 7aarticle03740naa a2200721 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002000111024003200131040001800163100001700181245015300198300001800351500001500369506007600384520142300460506003701883650002701920650001801947650001801965650001801983650001902001650002202020650001902042650002002061650002202081650001002103650001902113650002602132650001402158650001402172650003802186650002802224650004402252650003802296650001902334650003202353650001802385650002602403650004102429650001902470650001502489650002202504650002802526650003102554653002302585653001502608653000802623700001402631700001702645700001502662700001902677700001802696773014202714852000902856856008202865930003302947945001302980946001302993655001203006IND2321512120221207080653.0010613e20010522dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232151212DNAL7 a113538662pmid7 aPMC334982pmcid7 a10.1073/pnas.1114230982doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDi Serio, F.10aSense- and antisense-mediated gene silencing in tobacco is inhibited by the same viral suppressors and is associated with accumulation of small RNAs  ap. 6506-6510.  a2019-12-04  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aAntisense-mediated gene silencing (ASGS) and posttranscriptional gene silencing (PTGS) with sense transgenes markedly reduce the steady-state mRNA levels of endogenous genes similar in transcribed sequence. RNase protection assays established that silencing in tobacco plants transformed with plant-defense-related class I sense and antisense chitinase (CHN) transgenes is at the posttranscriptional level. Infection of tobacco plants with cucumber mosaic virus strain FN and a necrotizing strain of potato virus Y, but not with potato virus X, effectively suppressed PTGS and ASGS of both the transgenes and homologous endogenes. This suggests that ASGS and PTGS share components associated with initiation and maintenance of the silent state. Small, ca. 25-nt RNAs (smRNA) of both polarities were associated with PTGS and ASGS in CHN transformants as reported for PTGS in other transgenic plants and for RNA interference in Drosophila. Similar results were obtained with an antisense class I beta-1,3-glucanase transformant showing that viral suppression and smRNAs are a more general feature of ASGS. Several current models hold that diverse signals lead to production of double-stranded RNAs, which are processed to smRNAs that then trigger PTGS. Our results provide direct evidence for mechanistic links between ASGS and PTGS and suggest that ASGS could join a common PTGS pathway at the double-stranded RNA step.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3agenetic transformation 3amessenger RNA 3aantisense RNA 3aantisense DNA 3aPotato virus X 3atransgenic plants 3abeta-glucanase 3agene expression 3aNicotiana tabacum 3agenes 3aPotato virus Y 3aCucumber mosaic virus 3ainfection 3achitinase 2aChitinasesxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aCucumovirusxphysiology 2aGene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic 2aGene Expression Regulation, Plant 2aGene Silencing 2aGlucan 1,3-beta-Glucosidase 2aPlants, Toxic 2aPotyvirusxphysiology 2aRNA Processing, Post-Transcriptional 2aRNA, Antisense 2aRNA, Plant 2aTobaccoxgenetics 2aTransformation, Genetic 2abeta-Glucosidasexgenetics 0agenetic regulation 0aprecursors 0aRNA1 aSchob, H.1 aIglesias, A.1 aTarina, C.1 aBouldoires, E.1 aMeins, F.

These complexes contain at least 17 subunits, including the water-oxidizing complex (WOC), and 32 chlorophyll a molecules/PS II; they are active in light-induced electron transfer and water oxidation. The crystals belong to the orthorhombic space group P212121, with four PS II dimers per unit cell. High-frequency EPR is used for enhancing the sensitivity of experiments performed on small single crystals as well as for increasing the spectral resolution of the g tensor components and of the different crystal sites. Magnitude and orientation of the g tensor of tyrosine radical and related information on several proton hyperfine tensors are deduced from analysis of angular-dependent EPR spectra. The precise orientation of tyrosine radical in PS II is obtained as a first step in the EPR characterization of paramagnetic species in these single crystals.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aproteins 3afree radicals 3acrystals 3aSynechococcus elongatus 3atyrosine 3aphotosystem II 3aelectron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy 3achlorophyll 0awater oxidizing complex 0aSynechococcus1 aZouni, A.1 aBittl, R.1 aKern, J.1 aOrth, P.1 aLendzian, F.1 aFromme, P.1 aWitt, H.T.1 aLubitz, W.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2001 June 5, v. 98, no. 12 p.6623-6628x0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1011275983Available from publisher's Web site  a20010903b20010910c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US 7aarticle02684naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002000111024003200131040001800163100001900181245009600200300001800296500001500314506007600329520119800405506003701603650002201640650002601662650002201688650002601710650001201736650001401748650001201762650001401774650001101788651001601799653002201815653002201837653001801859700001801877700001501895773014201910852000902052856008202061930003302143945001302176946001302189655001202202IND2322140920221207095242.0010721e20010605dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232214092DNAL7 a113716122pmid7 aPMC344162pmcid7 a10.1073/pnas.1110552982doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMulder, C.P.H.10aPhysical stress and diversity-productivity relationships: the role of positive interactions  ap. 6704-6708.  a2019-12-04  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aIf environmental stress provides conditions under which positive relationships between plant species richness and productivity become apparent, then species that seem functionally redundant under constant conditions may add to community functioning under variable conditions. Using naturally co-occurring mosses and liverworts, we constructed bryophyte communities to test relationships between species diversity (1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 24, or 32 species) and productivity under constant conditions and when exposed to experimental drought We found no relationship between species richness and biomass under constant conditions. However, when communities were exposed to experimental drought, biomass increased with species richness. Responses of individual species demonstrated that facilitative interactions rather than sampling effects or niche complementarity best explained results-survivorship increased for almost all species, and those species least resistant to drought in monoculture had the greatest increase in biomass. Positive interactions may be an important but previously underemphasized mechanism linking high diversity to high productivity under stressful environmental conditions.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aplant communities 3abotanical composition 3adrought tolerance 3amosses and liverworts 3abiomass 3amortality 2aBiomass 2aEcosystem 2aPlants 3aNew Zealand 0aspecies diversity 0acommunity ecology 0aplant ecology1 aUliassi, D.D.1 aDoak, D.F.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2001 June 5, v. 98, no. 12 p.6704-6708x0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1110552983Available from publisher's Web site  a20010903b20010910c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US 7aarticle02404naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001900145245010500164300001600269520114800285650002601433650001601459650001501475650002201490650001701512650001401529650002901543650000701572650001801579650001301597650001401610650001201624650001601636700002001652700002001672700002501692773012501717852000901842856008501851930003301936946001301969655001201982IND4433657520221119213126.0100305e201003  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443365752DNAL7 a10.1007/s00044-009-9179-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aArayne, Saeed 10aDrug interaction studies of H₂-receptor antagonists with mefloquine, pyrimethamine and sulfadoxine  ap. 136-156.  aFansimef is a new antimalarial schizontocide that contains mefloquine, pyrimethamine, and sulfadoxine with a weight ratio of 1:20:10. This antimalarial combination is highly active against multidrug-resistant strains of Plasmodium falciparum. H₂-receptor antagonists (cimetidine, famotidine, and ranitidine) are reversible competitive blockers of histamine at H₂-receptor and do not affect the H₁-receptor. These are potent inhibitors of all phases of gastric acid secretion. They do so by binding to H₂-receptors on the parietal cells of stomach. The effect of various dissolution mediums with respect to pH on these drug-drug interactions and in vitro availability reveals that availability of antimalarial drugs increased to a smaller extent in the presence of H₂-receptors. The influence of temperatures on these interactions has been examined to elucidate the mechanism of these interactions. Antimalarial drugs could be administrated concurrently with H₂-receptor antagonist (cimetidine and famotidine); however, ranitidine should not be given because availability was almost suppressed in the presence of antimalarial drugs. 3aPlasmodium falciparum 3aantagonists 3acimetidine 3adrug interactions 3agastric acid 3ahistamine 3amultiple drug resistance 3apH 3apyrimethamine 3aresearch 3asecretion 3astomach 3asulfadoxine1 aSultana, Najma 1 aNaseem, Sajida 1 aMirza, Agha Zeeshan 0 tMedicinal chemistry research.g2010 Mar., v. 19, no. 2 p.136-156dBoston : SP Birkhäuser Verlag Bostonx1054-25237nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00044-009-9179-73Available from publisher's Web site  a20100305b20100403c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle03492naa a2200649 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146072000900164072000900173072000900182072000900191100002600200245009800226300001600324500002400340520147000364650001401834650001301848650001701861650000901878650001001887650001701897650002801914650001401942650001601956650002901972650002502001650002502026650001202051650004302063650005402106650005002160650004102210650004102251650003702292650004002329650003702369650000902406650003302415650000902448650002502457650004602482650001902528650001802547700001902565773008102584852000902665856008502674930003302759945002502792946001302817655001202830IND4392834320221119213235.0070702e200707  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439283432DNAL7 a175825412pmid7 a10.1007/s11745-007-3077-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL500 0aT000 0aT200 0aT3001 aBursill, Christina A.12aA Green Tea Catechin Extract Upregulates the Hepatic Low-Density Lipoprotein Receptor in Rats  ap. 621-627.  aIncludes references  aGreen tea extracts have hypocholesterolaemic properties in epidemiological and animal intervention studies. Upregulation of the low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor may be one mechanism to explain this as it is the main way cholesterol is removed from the circulation. This study aimed to determine if a green tea extract could upregulate the hepatic LDL receptor in vivo in the rat. A green tea extract (GTE) enriched in its anti-oxidant constituents, the catechins, was fed to rats (n = 6) at concentrations of either 0, 0.5, 1.0 or 2.0% (w/w) mixed in with their normal chow along with 0.25% (w/w) cholesterol for 12 days. Administration of the GTE had no effect on plasma total or LDL cholesterol concentrations but high-density lipoprotein significantly increased (41%; p < 0.05). Interestingly, there was a significant increase in LDL receptor binding activity (2.7-fold) and LDL receptor protein (3.4-fold) in the 2% (w/w) treatment group compared to controls. There were also significant reductions in liver total and unesterified cholesterol (40%). Administration of the GTE significantly reduced cholesterol absorption (24%) but did not affect cholesterol synthesis. These results show that, despite no effect on plasma cholesterol, the GTE upregulated the LDL receptor in vivo. This appears to be via a reduction in liver cholesterol concentration and suggests that the green tea extract was able to increase the efflux of cholesterol from liver cells. 3agreen tea 3acatechin 3aantioxidants 3arats 3aliver 3ablood plasma 3alow density lipoprotein 3areceptors 3acholesterol 3ahigh density lipoprotein 3ahypercholesterolemia 2aAdministration, Oral 2aAnimals 2aAnticholesteremic Agentsxpharmacology 2aCatechinxisolation & purificationxpharmacology. 2aCholesterol, Dietaryxadministration & dosage 2aCholesterol, HDLxbloodxmetabolism. 2aCholesterol, LDLxbloodxmetabolism. 2aDose-Response Relationship, Drug 2aIntestinal Absorptionxdrug effects 2aLiverxdrug effectsxmetabolism. 2aMale 2aPlant Extractsxpharmacology 2aRats 2aRats, Sprague-Dawley 2aReceptors, LDLxdrug effectsxmetabolism. 2aTeaxchemistry 2aUp-Regulation1 aRoach, Paul D.0 tLipids.g2007 July, v. 42, no. 7 p.621-627dSpringer-Verlagx0024-42017nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11745-007-3077-x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20070828b20070902c00000000  aINDdRSCe2007/08/28  aOther US 7aarticle03619naa a2200757 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002000111024003200131040001800163100001900181245015000200300001800350506007600368520122300444506003701667650003701704650001101741650002601752650002501778650002401803650000901827650001501836650002001851650001901871650002501890650001201915650001201927650003101939650002701970650001201997650001102009650006302020650002702083650007002110650001102180650001102191650002502202650000902227650002302236650001402259650003502273650001302308650002102321650002902342653001302371653003802384700001902422700001502441700001202456700001402468700001602482700001302498700001502511700001702526700001402543773014202557852000902699856008202708930003302790945001302823946001302836655001202849IND2321396420221207095157.0010607e20010327dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232139642DNAL7 a112596412pmid7 aPMC311932pmcid7 a10.1073/pnas.0414908982doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLasmezas, C.I.10aAdaptation of the bovine spongiform encephalopathy agent to primates and comparison with Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease: implications for human health  ap. 4142-4147.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThere is substantial scientific evidence to support the notion that bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) has contaminated human beings, causing variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD). This disease has raised concerns about the possibility of an iatrogenic secondary transmission to humans, because the biological properties of the primate-adapted BSE agent are unknown. We show that (i) BSE can be transmitted from primate to primate by intravenous route in 25 months, and (ii) an iatrogenic transmission of vCJD to humans could be readily recognized pathologically, whether it occurs by the central or peripheral route. Strain typing in mice demonstrates that the BSE agent adapts to macaques in the same way as it does to humans and confirms that the BSE agent is responsible for vCJD not only in the United Kingdom but also in France. The agent responsible for French iatrogenic growth hormone-linked CJD taken as a control is very different from vCJD but is similar to that found in one case of sporadic CJD and one sheep scrapie isolate. These data will be key in identifying the origin of human cases of prion disease, including accidental vCJD transmission, and could provide bases for vCJD risk assessment.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abovine spongiform encephalopathy 3aprions 3aintravenous injection 3adisease transmission 3aMacaca fascicularis 3amice 3acerebellum 3acerebral cortex 3ahistopathology 3aimmunohistochemistry 3ascrapie 3astrains 3aCreutzfeldt-Jakob Syndrome 2aAdaptation, Biological 2aAnimals 2aCattle 2aCreutzfeldt-Jakob Syndromexphysiopathologyxtransmission. 2aDisease Models, Animal 2aEncephalopathy, Bovine Spongiformxphysiopathologyxtransmission. 2aFemale 2aHumans 2aImmunohistochemistry 2aMice 2aMice, Inbred C57BL 2aPhenotype 2aPrimate Diseasesxtransmission 2aPrimates 2aPrionsxanalysis 2aScrapiexphysiopathology 0asymptoms 0avarient creutzfeldt-jakob disease1 aFournier, J.G.1 aNouvel, V.1 aBoe, H.1 aMarce, D.1 aLamoury, F.1 aKopp, N.1 aHauw, J.J.1 aIronside, J.1 aBruce, M.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2001 Mar. 27, v. 98, no. 7 p.4142-4147x0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.0414908983Available from publisher's Web site  a20010801b20010808c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US 7aarticle02417naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002000152245014800172300001600320500002400336520131000360650001301670650001401683650002001697653001401717653001301731653001501744700001501759700001901774700002001793773012501813852000901938856007601947930003302023946001102056655001202067IND4389685520221119212925.0070325e200704  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438968552DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1095-8312.2007.00770.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aATKINS, NATALIA10aLate stage deferral of parturition in the viviparous lizard Niveoscincus ocellatus (Gray 1845): implications for offspring quality and survival  ap. 735-746.  aIncludes references  aThe ability of viviparous lizards to defer parturition after completion of embryonic development is a potentially key strategy for enhancing offspring fitness. Using the spotted snow skink, Niveoscincus ocellatus, we investigated the ability of females to defer birth if placed into cold conditions at the same time, for 1, 2 or 3 weeks at the end of gestation. The ability to defer birth was compared between two populations at each end of the species' altitudinal range. We hypothesized that females from the high elevation population would be less likely to defer parturition under extended periods of poor conditions, thus ensuring that young were not born too late in the season. In all but the 3-week treatment group from the high elevation population, females were able to defer birth when placed under cold conditions: for all groups, there was no treatment effect on offspring phenotype at birth, dispersal distance or survivorship after release. However, there was a significant negative effect of treatment on offspring growth measured after release, with the results differing between the populations. Females from the high elevation population were less able to defer birth under long periods (3 weeks) of cold conditions, and this was accompanied by a decrease in viability of the offspring. 3aaltitude 3apregnancy 3amaternal effect 0adispersal 0asquamate 0atrade-offs1 aSWAIN, ROY1 aWapstra, Erik.1 aJones, Susan M.0 tBiological journal of the Linnean Society.g2007 Apr., v. 90, no. 4 p.735-746dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0024-40667nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1095-8312.2007.00770.x3electronic resource  a20070325b20070402c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02852naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127072001700144072001700161072001700178100001800195245007500213300002000288520159700308650001401905650001801919650002301937650002401960650002001984650002402004650002002028650001902048650002102067650001402088650001002102650001202112650001402124650001502138700001702153700001902170773011302189852000902302930003302311945002502344946001302369655001202382IND4430875220221119213154.0100107e200910  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443087522DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aManar, Rachid10aReproductive Effects and Bioaccumulation of Chlordane in Daphnia Magna  ap. 2150–2159.  aAcute and chronic toxicity of high-grade chlordane (98%) and bioaccumulation were investigated in Daphnia magna at water soluble concentrations obtained without cosolvent. The measured effective concentrations immobilizing 50% of the microcrustacea (95% confidence interval) were 22.6 (19.7–26.1) µg/L at 24 h and 13.4 (11.3–15.8) µg/L at 48 h. This indicated an increase of chlordane toxicity with time of exposure as confirmed in chronic studies. After 21 d of exposure, significant effects on survival were recorded at a chlordane concentration greater than 2.9 µg/L, whereas reproduction (number of offspring per adult, brood size) and length of adults decreased at 0.7 µg/L or more in a concentration- and time-dependent manner. The production of male offspring and developmental abnormalities, consisting of underdeveloped second antennae and shell spines in live neonates, were recorded. The chlordane concentration tested with no significant adverse effect (NOEC) on reproduction of daphnids after 21 d compared with controls was 0.18 µg/L. The bioaccumulation factor of chlordane by daphnids exposed at a level of concentration close to the 21-d NOEC reached 10,600, wet weight, and 244,000, dry weight, after 40 d. The trans-chlordane bioaccumulated to a greater extent than the cis isomer in daphnids, whereas the cis isomer was predominant in the test medium. The results suggest a crucial role of the invertebrates in transfer of chlordane in aquatic food webs and can be used to derive a freshwater guideline for environmental protection accounting for bioaccumulation. 3achlordane 3aDaphnia magna 3aaquatic arthropods 3anontarget organisms 3abioaccumulation 3aanimal reproduction 3awater pollution 3aacute toxicity 3achronic toxicity 3amortality 3amales 3aisomers 3afood webs 3afreshwater1 aBessi, Hlima1 aVasseur, Paule0 tEnvironmental toxicology and chemistry.g2009 Oct., v. 28, no. 10 p.2150–2159-2150–2159x0730-72687nnas  aDNAL  a20100522b20100605c00000000  aINDdYLPe2010/05/03  aOther US 7aarticle02459naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245009700127300001800224500002400242520147800266650002101744650002501765650001601790650001901806650001301825650002401838650001401862650002701876650001201903650001001915650001301925700001701938700001701955700001501972700001801987773007102005852000902076655001202085IND4366498520221119213134.0050108s2004    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436649852DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRosier, C.L.10aGrowth stage, auxin type, and concentration influence rooting of Virginia pine stem cuttings  ap. 1392-1396.  aIncludes references  aSeven concentrations of indole-3-butyric acid (IBA), seven concentrations of 1-naphthaleneacetic acid (NAA), and a nonauxin control were tested over three growth stages to determine their ability to promote adventitious rooting of stem cuttings from 3- and 4-year-old stock plants of virginia pine (Pinus virginiana Mill.). Cuttings were harvested September 2000 (semi-hardwood), February 2001 (hardwood), June 2001 (softwood), and October 2001 (semi-hardwood), treated with auxin concentrations ranging from 0 to 64 mM and placed under intermittent mist in a greenhouse. Rooting percentage, percent mortality, number of primary roots, total root length, root symmetry, root angle, and root diameter were assessed following 16 weeks. Growth stage affected every rooting trait measured except root symmetry and diameter. Auxin type affected total root length and root diameter, while auxin concentration affected every rooting trait except root angle. The highest predicted rooting percentages (46%) occurred when semi-hardwood cuttings were collected in September 2000 and treated with 7 mM auxin. Cuttings collected within the same growing season (2001) exhibited the highest predicted rooting percentage (33%) when softwood cuttings were treated with 6 mM auxin. Semi-hardwood cuttings rooted in 2001 produced the greatest number of roots and root lengths. Root diameter was significantly greater when NAA rather than IBA was applied, especially at higher concentrations. 3aPinus virginiana 3adevelopmental stages 3agreenhouses 3agrowing season 3ahardwood 3aindole butyric acid 3amortality 3anaphthaleneacetic acid 3arooting 3aroots 3asoftwood1 aFrampton, J.1 aGoldfarb, B.1 aWise, F.C.1 aBlazich, F.A.0 tHortScience.g2004 Oct., v. 39, no. 6 p.1392-1396x0018-53457nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle
