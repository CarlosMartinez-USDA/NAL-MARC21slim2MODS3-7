This was achieved by preincubating inductive medium with mycelium, followed by inoculation with fresh mycelium. We suggest that the active inducer is a product of gallic acid metabolism. Its formation can be prevented by trapping the quinone formed from gallic acid, using benzenesulphinic acid. We also show that induction of laccase formation can be inhibited by pre-treatment of the mycelium with 2,16,25-cucurbitacin D triacetate, prior to transfer to inductive medium. The implications for control of laccase formation are discussed. 3agallic acid 3abiosynthesis 3acucurbitacins 3aBotrytis cinerea 3alaccase 3amycelium 3aenzyme activity 3ametabolites 0ametabolism 0ainhibition 0ainduction 0agrowth1 aYagen, B.1 aMayer, A.M.0 tPhytochemistry.g1993 Sept., v. 34, no. 1 p.47-49x0031-94227nnas  aDNAL  a19940415b19940418c00000000  aINDdMKS  aNon-US 7aarticle03338naa a2200661 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002000164245010600184300001800290500002400308500001500332520146100347650000901808650001001817650001601827650001101843650002301854650001601877650001901893650001201912650001301924650002201937650001501959650001201974650003501986650001202021650001302033650002202046650002102068650002902089650002002118650002902138650002202167650003002189650002602219650004602245651001402291653001002305653001302315653001802328653001302346653001002359653001002369653000802379700001902387700001802406700002302424700001602447773010702463852000902570856008502579655001202664IND4448831020221122074714.0110204s2011    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444883102DNAL7 a208389042pmid7 a10.1007/s11033-010-0275-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIglesias, P.

We report a new insertion/deletion (InDel) polymorphism, consisting of a change of seven nucleotides for only one nucleotide (TCTGGGT → C) within intron 17 of the CAPN1 gene. The segregation pattern of this polymorphism was analyzed together with the markers CAPN316, CAPN530 and CAPN4751 already described. The allele distribution of CAPN1 markers in the Braford crossbreed (3/8 Brahman 5/8 Hereford) is described for the first time. Four assays of allelic discrimination were designed: the tetra primer ARMS-PCR technique for genotyping the new InDel and the CAPN4751 marker, and a PCR-RFLP method for genotyping the markers CAPN316 and CAPN530. The genotypic and minor allele frequencies (MAFs) obtained showed that the InDel polymorphism does not provide redundant information to that already provided by the other CAPN1 markers and segregates differently between breeds, being a common SNP (MAF ≥ 0.05) in the herds with a high percentage of Bos indicus background. The high percentage of heterozygous individuals found in the Braford crossbreed for the markers assessed reveals enough genetic variation that could help to solve the tenderness problem of tropical-adapted cattle. 3azebu 3aherds 3aproteinases 3acattle 3agenetic background 3anucleotides 3agene frequency 3aBrahman 3aHereford 3agenetic variation 3agenotyping 3aintrons 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism 2aAnimals 2aBreeding 2aCalpainxgenetics 2aCattlexgenetics 2aGene Frequencyxgenetics 2aGenetic Markers 2aINDEL Mutationxgenetics 2aIntronsxgenetics 2aPolymerase Chain Reaction 2aPolymorphism, Genetic 2aPolymorphism, Restriction Fragment Length 0aArgentina 0aInDel 0aARMS-PCR 0aBovine breeds 0aPCR-RFLP 0agenes 0aCAPN1 0aSNP1 aCaffaro, M.

Fully imbibed seeds show two peaks in respiration, followed by a gradual decline in the absence of stimulant. In the presence of stimulant two peaks are also discerned, one during the preconditioning and one during the germination period, which are followed by a gradual decline after the seeds germinate. Drying the seeds after preconditioning results in the non-appearance of the second respiratory peak and a slow decline in respiration. The drop following germination can probably be ascribed to exhaustion of substrate, but the decline in absence of germination stimulant must have other causes. Seeds take up and metabolize radioactive leucine both during preconditioning and germination. Part of the leucine is respired. The pattern of proteins present in the seeds shows distinct changes both during preconditioning and during germination. In addition, after 8 hr of preconditioning, a number of proteins are synthesized. Towards the end of the germination period, fewer new proteins are formed. In the absence of germination stimulant, incorporation of label into protein gradually declines with time and fewer new proteins are synthesized. The results clearly show that seeds which are not exposed to a germination stimulant are able to remain viable for considerable periods of time without damage. In contrast, seeds which start to germinate but do not reach a host show clear indications of exhaustion of their reserve materials and probably will die. 3aOrobanche aegyptiaca 3aseed germination 3apretreatment 3aprotein synthesis 3aimbibition 3aleucine 3aprotein composition 0asubstrates 0arespiration 0astimulation1 aMayer, A.M.0 tPhytochemistry.g1993 Sept., v. 34, no. 1 p.39-45x0031-94227nnas  aDNAL  a19940415b19940418c00000000  aINDdMKS  aNon-US 7aarticle01734naa a2200481 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024001800097040001800115100001600133245009800149300001600247520038400263650002000647650002000667650002200687650001700709650002100726650001300747650001200760650001700772650004500789650002200834650002000856650004300876650001100919650001100930650001100941650004100952650002500993653001301018700002201031700001601053700001501069773008001084852001301164939003301177945000801210946001301218852000901231655001201240991581934370742620221122062647.0920330e199203  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI920009162DNAL7 a15382892pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWoolf, A.D.10aIntentional infantile ethylene glycol poisoning presenting as an inherited metabolic disorder  ap. 421-424.  aA 6-month-old girl was hospitalized on three occasions for irritability, vomiting, acidosis, and hypotonia.

Their perception of colors is based on achromatic and chromatic information, though very few studies clearly distinguish the influence of both. We present here the results of field-cage experiments about the color perception of Fopius arisanus (Hymenoptera: Braconidae: Opiinae), an egg-pupal parasitoid of various fruit fly species (Diptera: Tephritidae). The tested insects were naive, fed and mated females. In all experiments, the wasps preferred the colors with the lower total reflectance in a spectrum of wavelengths above 450-500 nm. We conclude that F. arisanus females are not sensitive to the UV-blue part of the spectrum. Inversely we could not provide evidence that they are able of any hue discrimination, though the absence of response might indicate a lack of preference of naive females. Visual stimuli are predominant for F. arisanus females in close range landing site selection and even overrode the olfactory stimuli. The lack of innate preferences for chromatic cues is consistent with previous observations made on the specificity and the olfactory response of F. arisanus and may be related to the low innate specialization of this parasitoid. Its preference for dark colors matches the behavior of some polyphagous Tephritidae. It may reflect an innate attraction towards contrasted objects, as fruits appear within the foliage. 3aFopius arisanus 3aparasitoids 3afemales 3avision 3acolor 3areflectance 3aspectral analysis 3abiological control agents 3afruit flies 3awavelengths 0acolor vision 0acolor perception 0acolor preference 0aspectral sensitivity 0avisual discrimination 0aachromatic contrast1 aChiroleu, F.1 aDomerg, C.1 aQuilici, S.0 tBiological control.g2007 Oct., v. 43, no. 1 p.41-48dAcademic Pressx1049-96447nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biocontrol.2007.06.0093Available from publisher's Web site  a20080201b20080202c00000000  aINDdNZMe2008/02/01  aOther US 7aarticle03029naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002200110245013500132300001600267520184800283650002002131650001602151650002002167650001802187650002402205650004402229650002902273650001502302650001402317650002602331650002002357650002902377650002802406650002302434653002302457700001302480773006002493852000902553930003302562945001302595946001102608655001202619IND2035497620221122062538.0931022s1993    gw |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND203549762DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMonselise, E.B.I.10aDifferent ammonium-ion uptake, metabolism and detoxification efficiencies in two Lemnaceae. A 15N-nuclear magnetic resonance study  ap. 167-173.  a15N-nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy was used to follow nitrogen assimilation and amino-acid production in Wolffia arrhiza (L.) Hork. ex. Wimmer, clone Golan exposed to 4.0 mM 15NH4Cl solutions for 24 h. The main 15N-labelled metabolites were asparagine and glutamine, as well as substantial amounts of unreacted, intracellular NH4+. These results were compared with those of a previous study on Lemna gibba L. clone Hurfeish (Monselise et al., 1987, New Phytol. 10, 341-345) with regard to NH4+ uptake, assimilation and detoxification efficiencies. Both species, grown under continuous white light, were capable of preferential uptake of NH4+ in the presence of nitrate. Relative growth rates indicate that both species tolerate increased levels of NH4+ up to 10(-2) mol.1(-1), with L. gibba showing a slightly greater tolerance. No 15N-labelled free NH4+ was detectable in L. gibba, while in W. arrhiza excess NH4+ was found within the cells. This fact indicates that L. gibba is more efficient in detoxification than W. arrhiza excess NH4+ presumably because of inability of W. arrhiza to regenerate the "NH4+ traps", glutamate and aspartate, rapidly enough. This is also evident from the observation that addition of alpha-ketoglutarate to the medium caused nearly complete assimilation of intracellular NH4+ in W. arrhiza. In both plants, addition of alpha-ketoglutarate increased both NH4+ uptake and assimilation. Addition of L-methionine DL-sulfoximine, an inhibitor of glutamine synthetase inhibited NH4+ assimilation, while addition of azaserine, an inhibitor of glutamate synthase, resulted in 15N incorporation into the glutamine-amide position only. These results are consistent with the glutamine synthetase-glutamate synthase pathway being the major route of NH4+ assimilation in the two plants under the conditions used. 3aWolffia arrhiza 3aLemna gibba 3anutrient uptake 3aion transport 3anitrogen metabolism 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3ametabolic detoxification 3aasparagine 3aglutamine 3aamino acid metabolism 3aenzyme activity 3aglutamate-ammonia ligase 3aalpha-ketoglutaric acid 3aammonium compounds 0aglutamate synthase1 aKost, D.0 tPlanta.g1993, v. 189, no. 2 p.167-173x0032-09357nnas  aDNAL  a19931104b19931109c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US 7aarticle03305naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002400110245012900134300001600263500021600279520177200495650001902267650002402286650002002310650001302330650001002343650002302353650001702376650002002393650001302413650002302426650002202449650002402471650001402495650002202509653001702531653001502548653001702563653002102580653003902601700001502640700001502655773008702670852000902757930003302766945001302799946001102812655001202823IND2332278920221122054145.0030429s2002    enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233227892DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHernandez-Munoz, P.10aSimple method for the selection of the appropriate food simulant for the evaluation of a specific food/packaging interaction  ap. 192-200.  aIn the special issue: Food Packaging: Ensuring the Safety and Quality of Foods / edited by J. Gilbert and A. Lopez de Sa. Proceedings of the 2nd International Symposium held November 8-10, 2000, Vienna, Austria.  aKnowledge of the extent of food/packaging interactions is essential to provide assurance of food quality and shelf life, especially in migration and sorption processes that commonly reach equilibrium during the lifetime of a commercial packaged foodstuff. The limits of sorption and migration must be measured in the presence of the specific food or an appropriate food simulant. The partition equilibrium of food aroma compounds between plastic films and foods or food simulants (K(A,P/L)) has been characterized. Two polymers (LLDPE and PET), three organic compounds (ethyl caproate, hexanal and 2-phenylethanol), four food products with varying fat content (milk cream, mayonnaise, margarine and oil) and three simulants (ethanol 95%, n-heptane and isooctane) were selected for study. The results show the effect of the aroma compound volatility and polarity, as well as its compatibility with the polymer and the food or food simulant. Equilibrium constants for the organic compound between the polymers and a gaseous phase (K(A,P/V)) as well as between the food (or food simulant) and a gaseous phase (K(A,L/V)) were also determined. An approach is presented to estimate K(A,P/L) from the binary equilibrium constants K(A,P/V) and K(A,L/V). Calculated results were shown to describe experimental data very well and indicated that compatibility between the aroma and the food or food simulant is the main contributing factor to the partition equilibrium describing the extent of food/packaging interactions. Therefore, the measurement of liquid/vapour equilibrium can be regarded as a powerful tool to compare the effectiveness of food simulants as substitutes of a particular food product and can be used as a guide for the selection of the appropriate simulant. 3afood packaging 3apackaging materials 3aimitation foods 3apolymers 3aodors 3aaromatic compounds 3afood quality 3astorage quality 3asorption 3afood contamination 3achemical analysis 3amathematical models 3aequations 3apolyethylene film 0acontaminants 0aevaluation 0ainteractions 0aplastic barriers 0afood packaging materials migration1 aCatala, R.1 aGavara, R.0 tFood additives & contaminants.g2002, v. 19, no. suppl. p.192-200x0265-203X7nnas  aDNAL  a20030602b20030603c00000000  aINDdMKS  aNon-US 7aarticle02298naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003000092040001800122072001700140072001700157100001400174245007900188300001400267500001500281520097600296650001001272650002101282650003001303650002501333650002001358650002701378650002001405650002701425650002201452650002001474650001401494653001801508653002801526700001701554700001701571773009201588852000901680856008001689930003301769945002501802946001301827655001201840IND4378124120221122054222.0060227e200601  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437812412DNAL7 a10.1094/MPMI-19-00252doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Among these, endo-β-1,4-xylanases carry out the initial breakdown by cleaving internal bonds in the polymer backbone. We have isolated and characterized a gene, xyn11A coding for an endo-β-1,4-xylanase belonging to family 11 of glycosyl hydrolases. xyn11A was shown to be induced by xylan and repressed by glucose and to be expressed in planta. The disruption of xyn11A caused only a moderate decrease, about 30%, in the level of extracellular endo-β-1-4-xy-lanase activity and in the growth rate, with beechwood xylan as the only carbon source. However, deletion of the gene had a more pronounced effect on virulence, delaying the appearance of secondary lesions and reducing the average lesion size by more than 70%. Reintroducing the wild-type gene into the mutant strains reversed this phenotype back to wild type. 3axylan 3aBotrytis cinerea 3afungal diseases of plants 3aamino acid sequences 3agene expression 3aplant pathogenic fungi 3afungal proteins 3aendo-1,4-beta-xylanase 3aenzyme substrates 3aenzyme activity 3avirulence 0apathogenicity 0amolecular sequence data1 aEspino, J.J.1 aGonzalez, C.0 tMolecular plant-microbe interactions.g2006 Jan., v. 19, no. 1 p.25-32x0894-02827nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094/MPMI-19-00253Available from publisher's Web site  a20080523b20080606c00000000  aINDdRSCe2006/07/17  aOther US 7aarticle01265naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002100110245009700131300001600228520037400244650002000618650002300638650001500661650001700676650001700693650000700710650001400717650002000731700001500751700001600766773007900782852000900861930003300870945001300903946001100916655001200927IND2035409920221122054204.0931018e199304  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND203540992DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPurkarthofer, H.10aEffect of shear rate and culture pH on the production of xylanase by Thermomyces lanuginosus  ap. 405-410.  aThe pH-value and the stirrer speed during cultivation of the thermophilic fungus Thermomyces lanuginosus were found to have a pronounced influence on xylanase production using corn cobs as carbon source.

The experiment consisted of two greenhouse ventilation systems, the FPVT and the NVT. Two microclimate variables, air temperature and relative humidity, were measured inside the tunnels. There were significant differences in the daytime air temperatures and relative humidity levels between the FVT, NVT and the outside. The temperature in the NVT was 4 to 5°C higher than in the FPVT at midday, when solar radiation was at its peak. The relative humidity was higher in the FPVT than the NVT. At night, there was no significant difference in temperature. The relative humidity differed significantly between the FPVT, NVT and the outside. The microclimate in both tunnels was not uniform. During the daytime, the air temperatures were lower in the crop canopy than close to the cover, however at night, air temperatures were lower close to the cover than within the crop canopy in both tunnels. The total yield and total marketable yield from the FPVT were not significantly different from the total yield and total marketable yield from the NVT. The total unmarketable yield was significantly (P<0.001) higher in the NVT than in the FPVT. A cost benefit analysis for FPVT and NVT needs to be conducted for these two tunnels. Whitewashing and near infrared reflective screens could be investigated as tools to reduce the extreme solar heat gain of the greenhouses. 3aair 3aair temperature 3acanopy 3acost benefit analysis 3agreenhouses 3aheat 3amicroclimate 3arelative humidity 3asolar radiation1 aWorkneh, T.

Caudal extradural pressure was measured in 12 healthy horses. The pressure and any extradural pressure waves were recorded for 3 min after puncture, for 1 min after testing for lack of resistance (LOR), and for 10 min after lidocaine injection. Successful extradural drug administration was confirmed in all horses. The median extradural pressure findings after puncture, after LOR, immediately after injection and 10 min after needle placement were -1.60 kPa (range -2.27 to 1.33 kPa), -0.67 kPa (-2.27 to 5.73 kPa), 5.00 kPa (0.93 to 9.87 kPa) and 0.13 kPa (-0.67 to 4.53 kPa), respectively. Extradural pressure waves were not always present. Extradural space pressure was sub-atmospheric in most horses and extradural injection significantly increased this pressure for up to 10 min. Extradural pressure waves had limited usefulness in the confirmation of the correct placement of the needle. 3acentral nervous system 3apressure 3aadverse effects 3alidocaine 3amethodology 3aveterinary medicine 3adrug injection 3ahorses 3askull 2aAnesthesia, Epiduralxmethodsxveterinary. 2aAnesthetics, Localxadministration & dosage 2aAnimals 2aCerebrospinal Fluid Pressurexphysiology 2aEpidural Spacexphysiology 2aFemale 2aHorsesxphysiologyxsurgery. 2aInjections, Epiduralxveterinary 2aLidocainexadministration & dosage 2aMale 2aPressure 0aextradural space 0adrug delivery systems1 aMosing, Martina1 aMoens, Yves0 tVeterinary journal.g2009 Apr., v. 180, no. 1 p.112-115dHarcourtx1090-02337nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tvjl.2007.10.0243Available from publisher's Web site  a20090427b20090508c00000000  aINDd2CTe2009/04/09  aNon-US 7aarticle01969naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001400110245018200124300001400306520077200320650002501092650000801117650002201125650003201147650001201179650002501191650001601216650001301232650001901245650002801264650001201292650002601304650001101330700001501341700001401356773013501370852000901505930003301514945001301547946001101560655001201571IND2196492020221122044605.0990115e19980701ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND219649202DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHan, K.Y.14aThe uvsI gene of Aspergillus nidulans required for UV-mutagenesis encodes a homolog to REV3, a subunit of the DNA polymerase theta of yeast involved in translesion DNA synthesis  ap. 13-19.  aDefects in the uvsI gene of Aspergillus nidulans resulted in high UV sensitivity and reductions of spontaneous and UV-induced reversion of certain alleles. uvsI;uvsA double mutants exhibited high methyl methane sulfonate (MMS)-sensitivity in contrast to the slight sensitivity of the component single mutants.

The aim was to investigate the effect of grain type (barley or rye) and exogenous enzymes (β-glucanase or xylanase) on the composition of chicken caecal microbiota as examined by classical culturing and molecular techniques (fluorescent in-situ hybridisation (FISH) and terminal-restriction fragment-length polymorphism (T-RFLP)). 2. Plate counting revealed higher total numbers of anaerobic bacteria, lactic acid bacteria and yeasts in caecal contents of birds fed with rye-based diets than in birds fed with barley-based diets. 3. As assessed by FISH analysis, the most abundant bacterial groups in the broiler caeca were Clostridium coccoides-Eubacterium rectale followed by Bacteroides sp., Lactobacillus sp./Enterococcus sp., Bifidobacterium sp. and Enterobacteriaceae. For both cereal types, the enzyme supplementation significantly decreased the relative amount of Enterobacteriaceae. 4. The T-RFLP profiles indicated that the caecal microbiota of birds receiving rye-based diets was more diverse than that of birds fed on barley-based diets. 5. Irrespective of the method applied, the results indicate that the cereal type as well as the exogenous enzyme supplementation influence the microbiota in broiler chicken caeca, and may have the effect of reducing potentially pathogenic Enterobacteriaceae populations. 3aBacteroides 3aBifidobacterium 3aClostridium 3aEnterobacteriaceae 3aLactobacillus 3abarley 3abeta-glucanase 3abroiler chickens 3acecum 3adiet 3afluorescence in situ hybridization 3alactic acid bacteria 3arye 3axylanases 3ayeasts 2aAnimal Feed 2aAnimals 2aBacterial Load 2aCecumxmicrobiology 2aChickensxmicrobiology 2aDietxveterinary 2aDietary Supplements 2aEndo-1,4-beta Xylanasesxpharmacology 2aGlycoside Hydrolasesxpharmacology 2aHordeum 2aIn Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence 2aMale 2aMetagenomexdrug effects 2aPolymorphism, Restriction Fragment Length 2aSecale.1 aRuthowski, A.1 aKaczmarek, S.1 aJensen, B.B.1 aEngberg, R.M.1 aHojberg, O.0 tBritish poultry science.g2010 Aug., v. 51, no. 4 p.546-557dLongmanx0007-16687nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00071668.2010.5072433Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02197naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001500110245015400125300001600279520093500295650001901230650002101249650001201270650001901282650001501301650000901316650001201325650001601337650001001353650001501363650001601378650001301394650001301407650001301420650002601433650001801459650001301477700001601490700001301506700001701519773013701536852000901673930003301682945001301715946001101728655001201739IND2196493520221122044715.0990115e19980701ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND219649352DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHajjaj, H.10aSampling techniques and comparative extraction procedures for quantitative determination of intra- and extracellular metabolites in filamentous fungi  ap. 195-200.  aTwo methods for rapid sampling and three procedures for extraction of metabolites from the filamentous fungus Monascus ruber were compared.

In addition, this method is very simple to handle and allows the use of very low amounts (i.e. 10-20 mg dry mass) of cellular material since the removal of ethanol by evaporation after extraction results in a concentration step of metabolites. 3aMonascus ruber 3aalkali treatment 3aboiling 3acentrifugation 3achloroform 3acold 3aethanol 3aevaporation 3afungi 3ametabolism 3ametabolites 3amethanol 3amycelium 3anitrogen 3aquantitative analysis 3arapid methods 3aspraying1 aBlanc, P.J.1 aGoma, G.1 aFrancois, J.0 tFEMS microbiology letters.g1998 July 1, v. 164, no. 1 p.195-200aFederation of European Microbiological Societies.x0378-10977nnas  aDNAL  a20060205b00000000c00000000  aINDdGK1  aNon-US 7aarticle03096naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003000092040001800122072001700140072001700157072001700174072001700191100001600208245011500224300001800339500001500357520144400372650002801816650001701844650002201861650001801883650003201901650001301933650003001946650002901976650003002005650002302035650001602058650000902074650002702083650002002110650002302130650001402153650001702167650002302184653001002207653002502217653001202242700001902254773009702273852000902370856008002379930003302459945002502492946001302517655001202530IND4376542020221122034625.0051206e200512  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437654202DNAL7 a10.1094/MPMI-18-13332doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Basic questions remain unanswered regarding the interactions between the host plant and the fungus that lead to the accumulation of fumonisins in maize kernels. In this study, we evaluated the role of kernel endosperm composition in regulating fumonisin B1 (FB1) biosynthesis. We found that kernels lacking starch due to physiological immaturity did not accumulate FB1. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis indicated that kernel development also affected the expression of fungal genes involved in FB1 biosynthesis, starch metabolism, and nitrogen regulation. A mutant strain of F. verticillioides with a disrupted alpha-amylase gene was impaired in its ability to produce FB1 on starchy kernels, and both the wild-type and mutant strains produced significantly less FB1 on a high-amylose kernel mutant of maize. When grown on a defined medium with amylose as the sole carbon source, the wild-type strain produced only trace amounts of FB1, but it produced large amounts of FB1 when grown on amylopectin or dextrin, a product of amylopectin hydrolysis. We conclude that amylopectin induces FB1 production in F. verticillioides. This study provides new insight regarding the interaction between the fungus and maize kernel during pathogenesis and highlights important areas that need further study. 3acarbohydrate metabolism 3afumonisin B1 3aprotein synthesis 3aalpha-amylase 3ahost-pathogen relationships 3anitrogen 3afungal diseases of plants 3aphysiological regulation 3apolymerase chain reaction 3aFusarium fujikuroi 3aamylopectin 3acorn 3amicrobial colonization 3agene expression 3astrain differences 3aendosperm 3apathogenesis 3amicrobial genetics 0aseeds 0aGibberella fujikuroi 0astrains1 aWoloshuk, C.P.0 tMolecular plant-microbe interactions.g2005 Dec., v. 18, no. 12 p.1333-1339x0894-02827nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094/MPMI-18-13333Available from publisher's Web site  a20080417b20080502c00000000  aINDd1CTe2006/07/22  aOther US 7aarticle04018naa a2200769 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003000111040001800141072001700159072001700176100002400193245015100217300001800368500001500386520152200401650002601923650003701949650001101986650002501997650002202022650002002044650002102064650002502085650002902110650002002139650002702159650001902186650003702205650001502242650002402257650001002281650002302291650003102314650001202345650001802357650003802375650004902413650002802462650002802490650001302518650002902531650003302560650004002593650004902633650003902682650001402721650002702735650003102762653002802793653002702821700002002848700001602868700001502884700001802899700001702917700002702934773011502961852000903076856008003085930003303165945002503198946001303223655001203236IND4376540320221122034606.0051206e200512  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437654032DNAL7 a164780462pmid7 a10.1094/MPMI-18-12692doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aBoisson-Dernier, A.10aMtENOD11 gene activation during rhizobial infection and mycorrhizal arbuscule development requires a common AT-rich-containing regulatory sequence  ap. 1269-1276.  a2019-12-04  aThe MtENOD11 gene from the model legume Medicago truncatula is transcriptionally activated both in response to Sinorhizobium meliloti Nod factors and throughout infection of root tissues by the nitrogen-fixing microsymbiont. To identify the regulatory sequences involved in symbiosis-related MtENOD11 expression, a series of promoter deletions driving the beta-glucuronidase reporter gene were analyzed in transgenic M. truncatula roots. These studies have revealed that distinct regulatory regions are involved in infection-related MtENOD11 expression compared with preinfection (Nod factor-mediated) expression. In particular, the 257-bp promoter sequence immediately upstream from the start codon is sufficient for infection-related expression, but is unable to drive gene transcription in response to the Nod factor elicitor. This truncated promoter is also sufficient to confer MtENOD11 expression during both the arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) association and the parasitic interaction with root-knot nematodes. Site-directed mutagenesis further showed that a previously identified nodule-specific AT-rich motif is required for high-level MtENOD11 expression during S. meliloti infection as well as during AM colonization. However, mutation of this motif does not affect gene expression associated with nematode-feeding sites. Taken together, these results suggest a close link between regulatory mechanisms controlling transcriptional early nodulin gene activation during both rhizobial and AM root endosymbioses. 3atranscription factors 3avesicular arbuscular mycorrhizae 3aGlomus 3aregulatory sequences 3atransgenic plants 3agene activation 3aEnsifer meliloti 3aRhizobium rhizogenes 3atranscription (genetics) 3agene expression 3amicrobial colonization 3areporter genes 3agenetic techniques and protocols 3anodulation 3aMedicago truncatula 3aroots 3abeta-glucuronidase 2aAT Rich Sequencexgenetics 2aAnimals 2aGene Deletion 2aGene Expression Regulation, Plant 2aMedicago truncatulaxgeneticsxmicrobiology. 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aMycorrhizaexphysiology 2aNematoda 2aPlant Proteinsxgenetics 2aPlants, Genetically Modified 2aPromoter Regions, Geneticxgenetics 2aRegulatory Sequences, Nucleic Acidxgenetics 2aSinorhizobium melilotixmetabolism 2aSymbiosis 2aTranscription, Genetic 2aTranscriptional Activation 0amolecular sequence data 0aSinorhizobium meliloti1 aAndriankaja, A.1 aChabaud, M.1 aNiebel, A.1 aJournet, E.P.1 aBarker, D.G.1 aCarvalho-Niebel, F. de0 tMolecular plant-microbe interactions.g2005 Dec., v. 18, no. 12 p.1269-1276wJournal:jnl43555x0894-02827nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094/MPMI-18-12693Available from publisher's Web site  a20080417b20080502c00000000  aINDd1CTe2006/07/21  aOther US 7aarticle01452naa a2200361 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100001600115245006000131300001600191500002300207520049000230650001800720650003100738650001400769650001300783650001400796650001700810650001700827653002300844653001900867653002000886700001900906700001400925773007600939852000901015939003301024945000801057946001301065655001201078991581931130742620221122034523.0920406e199108  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI920010322DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNurge, M.E.10aMetabolic and nutritional implications of valproic acid  ap. 949-960.  aLiterature review.  aIdentifying drug-nutrient interactions is a significant concern to practitioners.

  1 aWang, Z.10aGmCOI1, a soybean F-box protein gene, shows ability to mediate jasmonate-regulated plant defense and fertility in Arabidopsis  ap. 1285-1295.  aThe F-box protein gene COI1 from Arabidopsis plays a fundamental role in response to jasmonates, which regulate plant root growth, pollen fertility, wounding and healing, and defense against pathogens and insects. Null mutations in COI1 were previously found to abolish all the jasmonate responses, and the Arabidopsis coil-1 mutant is male sterile and susceptible to pathogen infection. In this study, we isolated an F-box protein gene from soybean, which shares significant homology with the Arabidopsis COI1 and similarly contains an F-box motif and leucine rich repeats (LRR), here designated GmCOI1 (Glycine max L. (Merr.) COI1). To test whether the sequence homology and structural similarity are indicative of functional conservation, we expressed GmCOI1 in the Arabidopsis coil-1 mutant. The transgenic coil-1 plants with expression of the GmCOI1 gene were found to exhibit normal jasmonate responses, including jasmonate-regulated plant defense and fertility. In addition, the chimerical proteins with swapped domain of the F-box motif or LRR between GmCOI1 and COI1 were shown to functionally complement the coil-1 mutation. Furthermore, GmCOI1 was found to assemble into the Skpl-Cullin-F-box (SCF) complexes, similar to the formation of the Arabidopsis SCF(COI1). These data demonstrate the soybean F-box protein gene GmCOI1 is able to mediate jasmonate-regulated plant defense and fertility in Arabidopsis, which implies a generic jasmonate pathway with conserved signal components in different plant species. 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3asoybeans 3aGlycine max 3aamino acid sequences 3ajasmonic acid 3agene expression 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3asequence homology 3amutants 3atransgenic plants 3aplant fertility 3aresistance mechanisms 3asignal transduction 3abiochemical pathways 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aArabidopsisxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aCyclopentanesxmetabolism 2aGene Expression Regulation, Plant 2aGenes, Plantxgenetics 2aHomeodomain Proteinsxchemistryxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aOxylipins 2aPhenotype 2aPlant Diseases 2aPlant Proteinsxchemistryxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aPlants, Genetically Modified 2aReproductionxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aSequence Homology, Amino Acid 2aSoybeansxgenetics 0amolecular sequence data1 aDai, L.1 aJiang, Z.1 aPeng, W.1 aZhang, L.1 aWang, G.1 aXie, D.0 tMolecular plant-microbe interactions.g2005 Dec., v. 18, no. 12 p.1285-1295wJournal:jnl43555x0894-02827nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094/MPMI-18-12853Available from publisher's Web site  a20080417b20080502c00000000  aINDd1CTe2006/07/22  aOther US 7aarticle01578naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245007600127300001600203500001500219520059700234650001700831650001900848650002700867650001400894650001200908650001500920653001600935653001700951653001100968700002100979700001501000700001901015700001301034773007901047852000901126930003301135945001301168946001101181655001201192IND2035408120221122034523.0931018e199304  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND203540812DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aObradors, N.10aEffects of different fatty acids in lipase production by Candida rugosa  ap. 357-360.  a2019-12-04  aOleic acid has been reported as a good inducer of lipase production by Candida rugosa. In order to know if this enzyme is induced by oleic acid itself or by a metabolite, different short chain fatty acids were tested. Butyric acid was the best carbon source to growth microorganism but it did not induce lipase production. Although caprylic and capric acid were the best inducers of lipase production, at concentrations up 1 g/l they have toxic effect in Candida rugosa growth.

  1 aCastaneda, A.10aMutagenesis of all eight avr genes in Xanthomonas campestris pv. campestris had no detected effect on pathogenicity, but one avr gene affected race specificity  ap. 1306-1317.  a2019-12-04  aSuppression subtractive hybridization (SSH) was used to identify genes present in the systemic crucifer black rot pathogen Xanthomonas campestris pv. campestris 528T but missing from the nonsystemic crucifer leaf spot pathogen, X. campestris pv. armoraciae 417. Among the DNA fragments unique to 528T was Xcc2109, one of eight putative avr genes identified in the published 528T genome (NC_003902). Individual and sequential deletion, insertion mutations, or both of all eight 528T avr gene loci were made, but no change in pathogenicity was observed with any combination of avr mutations, including a strain with all eight avr genes deleted. However, insertion or deletion mutants affecting the Xcc2109 locus lost avirulence (i.e., became virulent) on Florida Mustard, an X. campestris pv. campestris race-determining, differential host. The Xcc2109 open reading frame as annotated was cloned and found to be nonfunctional. A longer gene, encompassing Xcc2109 and here designated avrXccFM, was cloned and found to complement the Xcc2109 mutants and to confer avirulence to two additional wild-type X. campestris pv. campestris strains, thereby changing their races. Resistance in Florida Mustard to 528T strains carrying avrXccFM occurred without a typical hypersensitive response (HR) on leaves, although a vascular HR was observed in seedlings. 3araces 3ainsertional mutagenesis 3aloci 3amicrobial genetics 3aXanthomonas campestris pv. campestris 3aavirulent strains 3aseedlings 3apolymerase chain reaction 3aopen reading frames 3ahybridization 3ahost-pathogen relationships 3aBrassica juncea 3agenes 3amutants 3aprotein secretion 3agene deletion 3avirulence 3ahypersensitive response 3aleaves 2aBacterial Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aGene Expression Regulation, Bacterial 2aGenes, Bacterialxgenetics 2aMustard Plantxmicrobiology 2aMutationxgenetics 2aPlant Leavesxmicrobiology 2aVirulencexgenetics 2aXanthomonas campestrisxclassificationxgeneticsxpathogenicity. 0anonpathogenic strains 0amolecular sequence data 0asuppression subtractive hybridization 0aBrassica1 aReddy, J.D.1 aEl-Yacoubi, B.1 aGabriel, D.W.0 tMolecular plant-microbe interactions.g2005 Dec., v. 18, no. 12 p.1306-1317wJournal:jnl43555x0894-02827nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094/MPMI-18-13063Available from publisher's Web site  a20080417b20080502c00000000  aINDd1CTe2006/07/22  aOther US 7aarticle02042naa a2200433 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100001600115245006100131300001600192520094700208650002001155650000901175650002301184650002201207650002001229650001601249650000901265650001701274650001901291650000801310650001301318650002001331651001201351653001001363653001701373700001501390700002001405700001501425700001701440773007601457852000901533939003301542945000801575946001301583655001201596991581930420742620221122015853.0920406e199108  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI920010312DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGuiro, A.T.10aIron absorption from African pearl millet and rice meals  ap. 885-893.  aIron absorption was measured from three West African meals in fourteen subjects, using the extrinsic tag method. The staple foods consisted of local pearl millet (Pennisetum typhoides) or imported broken rice. The meals were contaminated by iron from soil residues and/or by dust and up to 60%, of the nonheme iron did not exchange with the added inorganic radiotracer. Nonheme iron absorption was very low particularly with the pearl millet based meals. The iron absorption was 4.8% for the pearl millet "couscous" meal, 1.2% for the pearl millet gruel meal and 10.4% for rice and fish meal. The quantity of total iron absorbed was 326 micrograms, 69 micrograms and 279 micrograms, respectively. The corresponding bioavailable iron density was 28, 5 and 22 micrograms/100 Kcal. The results suggest that iron absorption from West African meals is insufficient to cover the physiological requirements of iron of a large part of the population. 3abioavailability 3arice 3aPennisetum glaucum 3atraditional foods 3amineral content 3ablood serum 3airon 3aerythrocytes 3aprotoporphyrin 3amen 3aferritin 3airon absorption 3aSenegal 0ameals 0anonheme iron1 aGalán, P.1 aCherouvrier, F.1 aSall, M.G.1 aHercberg, S.0 tNutrition research.g1991 Aug., v. 11, no. 8 p.885-893x0271-53177nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aFNC  aOther US 7aarticle02967naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004300092040001800135072000900153072000900162072000900171072000900180100002200189245014300211300001400354500002400368500001500392520153000407650002501937650001701962650002101979650001302000650002402013650003302037650001602070650001002086650001402096653002602110653002302136700002102159700002102180700002302201773009002224852000902314856009302323930003302416945002502449946001102474655001202485IND4417657220221122015608.0090313e20090403xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441765722DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aquaculture.2008.12.0312doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL210 0aL840 0aM001 0aM1201 aYoung, William P.10aNo increase in developmental deformities or fluctuating asymmetry in rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) produced with cryopreserved sperm  ap. 13-18.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aAlthough cryopreservation is a widely accepted tool in animal breeding and human reproduction, questions have arisen regarding the health and viability of fish sired by cryopreserved sperm. We examined rainbow trout families produced using fresh and cryopreserved milt to determine if sperm cryopreservation negatively influenced early development. Fresh and cryopreserved milt from 3 males were used to fertilize eggs from 6 females in a 3x6 factorial design. Survival to eye, survival to fry, proportion of fry deformities and developmental stability were compared for fresh vs. cryopreserved milt. Results revealed a significant reduction in survival to eye (P <0.001) and survival to fry (P <0.001) for families sired using cryopreserved milt. Survival during the interval from eye to fry did not differ among the groups (P =0.127), indicating that survival differences occurred prior to the eye stage. These results could be explained by reduced fertilization success of cryopreserved sperm. We examined developmental differences by analyzing the proportion of haploid embryos at the eyed stage, the proportion of fry deformities at hatch and fluctuating asymmetry (FA) of pectoral fin rays. Results revealed no significant difference between the groups. Our observations that surviving fry produced using cryopreserved sperm showed no differences in early development suggest that sperm cryopreservation is a viable option for use in breeding programs and in conservation and recovery of imperiled salmonid populations. 3askeletal development 3afish culture 3acryopreservation 3afish fry 3aOncorhynchus mykiss 3afertilization (reproduction) 3aspermatozoa 3atrout 3amortality 0afluctuating ssymmetry 0aanimal development1 aFrenyea, Kathryn1 aWheeler, Paul A.1 aThorgaard, Gary H.0 tAquaculture.g2009 Apr. 3, v. 289, no. 1-2 p.13-18dElsevier Sciencex0044-84867nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquaculture.2008.12.0313Available from publisher's Web site  a20090513b20090608c00000000  aINDdRSCe2009/05/13  aNon-US 7aarticle02812naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003000092040001800122072001700140072001700157072001700174100001900191245013100210300001800341520136000359650002501719650002301744650002601767650002401793650001901817650002201836650001701858650003201875650002701907650002701934650002501961653002801986700001902014700002102033700001502054700001602069773009702085852000902182856008002191930003302271945002502304946001302329655001202342IND4375858420221122020152.0051107e200511  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437585842DNAL7 a10.1094/MPMI-18-12262doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aMcDowell, J.M.10aGenetic analysis of developmentally regulated resistance in downy mildew (Hyaloperonospora parasitica) in Arabidopsis thaliana  ap. 1226-1234.  aAlthough developmentally regulated disease resistance has been observed in a variety of plant-pathogen interactions, the molecular basis of this phenomenon is not well understood. Arabidopsis thaliana ecotype Columbia-0 (Col-0) expresses a developmentally regulated resistance to Hyaloperonospora parasitica isolate Emco5. Col-0 seedlings support profuse mycelial growth and asexual spore formation in the cotyledons. In contrast, Emco5 growth and reproducetion is dramatically (but not completely) restricted in the first set of true leaves. Subsequent leaves exhibit progresssively increased resistance. This adult resistance is strongly suppressed by expression of the salicylic acid-degrading transgene NahG and by loss-of-function mutations in the defense-response regulators PAD4, NDR1, RAR1, PBS3, and NPR1. In contrast to Col-0, the Wassilewskija-0 (Ws-0) ecotype supports profuse growth of Emco5 at all stages of development. Gene-dosage experiments and segregation patterns indicate that adult susceptibility in Ws-0 is incomepletely dominant to adult resistance in Col-0. Genetic mapping in a Col x Ws F2 population revealed a major locus on the bottom arm of chromosome 5, which we named RPP31. Analysis of T-DNA insertion lines indicated that the Columbia allele of RPP8, though tightly linked to RPP31, is not necessary for adult resistance. 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3adisease resistance 3aresistance mechanisms 3asignal transduction 3aplant genetics 3aplant development 3adowny mildew 3ahost-pathogen relationships 3aPeronospora parasitica 3aplant pathogenic fungi 3anucleotide sequences 0amolecular sequence data1 aWilliams, S.G.1 aFunderburg, N.T.1 aEulgem, T.1 aDangl, J.L.0 tMolecular plant-microbe interactions.g2005 Nov., v. 18, no. 11 p.1226-1234x0894-02827nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094/MPMI-18-12263Available from publisher's Web site  a20080326b20080404c00000000  aINDdRSCe2005/11/12  aOther US 7aarticle03302naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004100092040001800133100001300151245009700164300001600261500012000277500002400397500001500421520167000436650001302106650002102119650001402140650002502154650001202179650001902191650001002210650001002220650001502230650002102245650002302266650001602289650002002305650001302325650001102338650001602349650001802365650001102383650000902394650002202403650002502425650001202450650000702462650001002469650001602479653001902495700001902514773014002533852000902673856005402682655001202736IND4449429020221122015811.0110222s2010    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444942902DNAL7 a10.17660/ActaHortic.2010.877.152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDing, P.10aInfluence of Fruit Bagging on Postharvest Quality of 'Harumanis' Mango (Mangifera indica L.)  ap. 169-174.  aPaper presented at the Sixth International Postharvest Symposium, Volume 1, held April 8-12, 2009, Antalya, Turkey.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-05  aOne of the famous varieties of mango in Malaysia is 'Harumanis' mango. It is pleasant in smell and sweet in taste with orange pulp. The skin remains green although it has ripened. These green-riped mango gains low priority on the market due to consumers preference of fruit with a yellow skin color as an indicator of ripeness. Therefore, the objective of this study was to determine the influence of bagging on postharvest quality of 'Harumanis' mango. Five types of bagging bags with 3 replications were used to bag young mango fruit at the age of 8 weeks after flower anthesis. The 5 different bags were constructed using old newspaper, brown and black paper. Fruits were manually harvested at 8 weeks after bagging when the fruits have matured. The ripening operation was initiated by using 10 ml/L of ethylene for 24h at 26°C. Postharvest quality such as skin and pulp color, skin chlorophylls and carotenoid content, pulp firmness, soluble solids concentration (SSC), pH, titratable acidity (TA), vitamin C, weight loss, skin glossiness and disease severity were determined at day 0, 1, 3 and 5. The experiment was conducted using a completely randomized design and obtained data were analyzed using analysis of variance and mean separation following the Least Significant Difference method. Bagging 'Harumanis' mango fruit during preharvest with different color of paper did not affect mango pulp color, carotenoid content, weight loss, pulp firmness, SSC, pH, TA, vitamin C, skin glossiness and disease severity. However, bagging using brown and/or black paper had shown significant effect on skin color and chlorophylls content of 'Harumanis' mango fruit. 3aethylene 3aMangifera indica 3aflowering 3atotal soluble solids 3amangoes 3afood packaging 3apaper 3aodors 3amango pulp 3adisease severity 3atitratable acidity 3acarotenoids 3astorage quality 3afirmness 3aflavor 3aweight loss 3aascorbic acid 3afruits 3abags 3amanual harvesting 3aanalysis of variance 3aflowers 3apH 3acolor 3achlorophyll 0asoluble solids1 aSyakirah, M.N.0 tActa horticulturae.g2010 Nov., , no. 877 p.169-174dInternational Society for Horticultural SciencewJournal:jnl46289x0567-75727nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.17660/ActaHortic.2010.877.15 7aarticle03398naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004300092040001800135072000900153072000900162072000900171100001400180245015600194300001400350500002400364520198300388650001202371650001302383650002302396650002302419650001702442650002202459650002502481650001702506650001802523650002002541650001502561651001002576651001302586653002002599700001602619700002002635773009002655852000902745856009302754930003302847945002502880946001102905655001202916IND4417658320221122001716.0090313e20090403xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441765832DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aquaculture.2009.01.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL200 0aM001 0aM1201 aYuan, Tao10aIntraspecific genetic variation in mitochondrial 16S rRNA and COI genes in domestic and wild populations of Huaguizhikong scallop Chlamys nobilis Reeve  ap. 19-25.  aIncludes references  aA 468 base-pair fragment of the mitochondrial 16S rRNA gene and a 481 base-pair fragment of the mitochondrial COI gene were used to study the geographic structure and genetic diversity within Huaguizhikong scallop Chlamys nobilis Reeve. The samples were collected from one Thailand population (TH) which sequences were obtained from the GenBank database, five domestic stocks [Fujian (FJ), Guangxi (GX), Hainan (HN), Daya Bay (DW), and Zhanjiang (ZJ)] and two wild populations [Guangxi (GY) and Daya Bay (DY)]. Sixty polymorphic sites were found in COI gene, and thirty-nine haplotypes were detected in all samples. In addition, twenty-four polymorphic sites were found, and twenty-seven haplotypes were detected in all samples of 16S rRNA gene. The analysis of haplotype frequency distribution and molecular variation indicated that genetic variation and geographic structure were significant. To COI gene and combined data set, the majority (COI: 78.7%, combined data set: 78.5%) of the genetic variation was distributed within populations, furthermore, less than 37.0% genetic variation of 16S rRNA could be distributed within populations. Variance of 16S rRNA gene (4.3%), COI gene (26.1%), and combined data set (23.4%) could be attributed among different geographic regions. The richest variation of 16S rRNA was observed in TH population among the eight populations supported the fact that TH has richer genetic polymorphism than Chinese population, which may sustain the idea of stock introduction. Otherwise, in the present study, we found that the gene diversity (Hd) level of wild population was higher than cultured populations of C. nobilis in three data sets. Our results indicated that genetic composition of cultured C. nobilis populations in southern China have been significantly affected by hatchery performance. Besides, the FJ stock which was the center seed stock of scallop C. nobilis cultured populations has been preliminarily confirmed in our research. 3aChlamys 3ascallops 3aindigenous species 3aintroduced species 3awild animals 3agenetic variation 3agenetic polymorphism 3amitochondria 3aribosomal RNA 3amollusc culture 3aprovenance 3aChina 3aThailand 0aChlamys nobilis1 aHe, Maoxian1 aHuang, Liangmin0 tAquaculture.g2009 Apr. 3, v. 289, no. 1-2 p.19-25dElsevier Sciencex0044-84867nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquaculture.2009.01.0043Available from publisher's Web site  a20090513b20090608c00000000  aINDdRSCe2009/05/13  aNon-US 7aarticle03445naa a2200649 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003000111040001800141072001700159072001700176100001500193245012700208300001800335500001500353520121600368650003001584650001801614650003201632650003301664650002301697650002501720650002501745650003101770650006301801650003501864650001801899650002601917650001801943650001901961650004201980650004402022650002802066650002602094650006302120650003302183650005102216650003502267650003802302650002402340653002802364653003202392653001102424653002502435700001802460700001402478700001602492773011502508852000902623856008002632930003302712945002502745946001302770655001202783IND4375858120221122001823.0051107e200511  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437585812DNAL7 a163535552pmid7 a10.1094/MPMI-18-12052doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aNasser, W.10aPecS and PecT coregulate the synthesis of HrpN and pectate lyases, two virulence determinants in Erwinia chrysanthemi 3937  ap. 1205-1214.  a2019-12-04  aErwinia chrysanthemi strain 3937 is a necrotrophic bacterial plant pathogen. Pectinolytic enzymes and, in particular, pectate lyases play a key role in soft rot symptoms; however, the efficient colonization of plants by E. chrysanthemi requires additional factors. These factors include HrpN (harpin), a heat-stable, glycine-rich hydrophilic protein, which is secreted by the type III secretion system. We investigated the expression of hrpN in E. chrysanthemi 3937 in various environmental conditions and different regulatory backgrounds. Using lacZ fusions, hrpN expression was markedly influenced by the carbon source, osmolarity, growth phase, and growth substrate. hrpN was repressed when pectinolysis started and negatively regulated by the repressors of pectate lyase synthesis, PecS and PecT. Primer extension data and in vitro DNA-protein interaction experiments support a model whereby PecS represses hrpN expression by binding to the hrpN regulatory region and inhibiting transcript elongation. The results suggest coordinated regulation of HrpN and pectate lyases by PecS and PecT. A putative model of the synthesis of these two virulence factors in E. chrysanthemi during pathogenesis is presented. 3aplant pathogenic bacteria 3apectate lyase 3ahost-pathogen relationships 3abacterial diseases of plants 3abacterial proteins 3anucleotide sequences 3aErwinia chrysanthemi 3agene expression regulation 2aBacterial Outer Membrane Proteinsxbiosynthesisxgenetics. 2aBacterial Proteinsxphysiology 2aBase Sequence 2aChicoryxmicrobiology 2aCulture Media 2aDNA, Bacterial 2aGene Expression Regulation, Bacterial 2aGene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aOsmolar Concentration 2aDickeya chrysanthemixenzymologyxgeneticsxpathogenicity. 2aPlant Diseasesxmicrobiology 2aPolysaccharide-Lyasesxbiosynthesisxgenetics. 2aRepressor Proteinsxphysiology 2aTranscription Factorsxphysiology 2aVirulencexgenetics 0amolecular sequence data 0aPectobacterium chrysanthemi 0aharpin 0aglycine-rich protein1 aReverchon, S.1 aVedel, R.1 aBoccara, M.0 tMolecular plant-microbe interactions.g2005 Nov., v. 18, no. 11 p.1205-1214wJournal:jnl43555x0894-02827nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094/MPMI-18-12053Available from publisher's Web site  a20080326b20080404c00000000  aINDdRSCe2005/11/12  aOther US 7aarticle03884naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004000092040001800132100001600150245008000166300001600246500012000262500002400382520218400406650002502590650000902615650001702624650001502641650002402656650002502680650001702705650002302722650001702745650001802762650001102780650001502791650001002806650001702816650001902833650001002852650001202862650002802874650002202902650002602924650001802950650002902968650002102997650001703018650002203035650001903057650001503076650002503091773014003116852000903256856005303265655001203318IND4449426720221122001816.0110222s2010    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444942672DNAL7 a10.17660/ActaHortic.2010.877.82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKader, A.A.10aHandling of Horticultural Perishables in Developing vs. Developed Countries  ap. 121-126.  aPaper presented at the Sixth International Postharvest Symposium, Volume 1, held April 8-12, 2009, Antalya, Turkey.  aIncludes references  aThe basic requirements for maintaining quality and safety of horticultural perishables (fruits, vegetables, herbs, ornamentals) between harvest and consumption sites are the same in developing and developed countries. However, the extent of adoption of the specific harvesting and postharvest handling technologies varies greatly among countries and within each country, depending on scale of operation, intended markets, and the return on investment (cost/benefit ratio) of each technology. Although labor costs are lower in developing countries, labor training, productivity, and management are generally better in developed countries. Availability and efficient use of the cold chain is much more evident in developed countries than in developing countries. Unreliability of the power supply, lack of proper maintenance, and inefficiency of utilization of cold storage and refrigerated transport facilities are among the reasons for failure of the cold chain in developing countries. Cost of providing the cold chain per ton of produce depends on energy costs plus utilization efficiency of the facilities throughout the year. There is great variation among and within countries in the extent of compliance with quality standards and food safety regulations, which is associated with the extent of participation in the global marketing of fresh produce. Successful exporters of fresh produce from developing countries must follow the required quality standards and safety regulations such as avoiding microbial contamination, and requirements for traceability, of the importing companies and/or countries. Strategies for improving handling of horticultural perishables in developing countries include: (1) Application of current knowledge to improve the handling systems of horticultural perishables and assure their quality and safety; (2) Removing the socioeconomic constraints, such as inadequacies of infrastructure, poor marketing systems, and weak research and development capacity; and (3) Overcoming the limitations of small-scale operations by encouraging consolidation and vertical integration among producers and marketers of each commodity or group of commodities. 3abusiness enterprises 3acold 3acold storage 3acompliance 3adeveloped countries 3adeveloping countries 3aenergy costs 3afood contamination 3afresh market 3afresh produce 3afruits 3aharvesting 3aherbs 3ahorticulture 3ainfrastructure 3alabor 3amarkets 3amicrobial contamination 3aornamental plants 3apostharvest treatment 3arefrigeration 3aresearch and development 3asafety standards 3atraceability 3atraining (people) 3atransportation 3avegetables 3avertical integration0 tActa horticulturae.g2010 Nov., , no. 877 p.121-126dInternational Society for Horticultural SciencewJournal:jnl46289x0567-75727nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.17660/ActaHortic.2010.877.8 7aarticle03040naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003000111040001800141072001700159072001700176100001500193245011500208300001800323520124500341650002801586650002901614650001801643650001401661650002001675650002701695650003001722650001701752650001501769650002601784650002501810650003801835650002801873650003001901650005301931650005201984650002402036650003602060650001402096650003002110650003102140700002402171700001602195773011502211852000902326856008002335930003302415945002502448946001302473655001202486IND4375856520221122001747.0051107e200511  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437585652DNAL7 a163535472pmid7 a10.1094/MPMI-18-11232doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aLaus, M.C.10aExopolysaccharide structure is not a determinant of host-plant specificity in nodulation of Vicia sativa roots  ap. 1123-1129.  aExopolysaccharide (EPS)-deficient strains of the root nodule symbiote Rhizobium leguminosarum induce formation of abortive infection threads in Vicia sativa subsp. nigra roots. As a result, the nodule tissue remains uninfected. Formation of an infection thread can be restored by coinoculation of the EPS-deficient mutant with a Nod factor-deficient strain, which produces a similar EPS structure. This suggests that EPS contributes to host-plant specificity of nodulation. Here, a comparison was made of i) coinoculation with heterologous strains with different EPS structures, and ii) introduction of the pRL1JI Sym plasmid or a nod gene-encoding fragment in the same heterologous strains. Most strains not complementing in coinoculation experiments were able to nodulate V. sativa roots as transconjugants. Apparently, coinoculation is a delicate approach in which differences in root colonization ability or bacterial growth rate easily affect successful infection-thread formation. Obviously, lack of infection-thread formation in coinoculation studies is not solely determined by EPS structure. Transconjugation data show that different EPS structures can allow infection-thread formation and subsequent nodulation of V. sativa roots. 3aRhizobium leguminosarum 3anitrogen-fixing bacteria 3asoil bacteria 3asymbionts 3apolysaccharides 3acarbohydrate structure 3aVicia sativa subsp. nigra 3aroot nodules 3anodulation 2aCarbohydrate Sequence 2aConjugation, Genetic 2aLipopolysaccharidesxbiosynthesis 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPlant Rootsxmicrobiology 2aPolysaccharides, Bacterialxchemistryxgenetics. 2aRhizobium leguminosarumxchemistryxphysiology. 2aSpecies Specificity 2aStructure-Activity Relationship 2aSymbiosis 2aTransformation, Bacterial 2aVicia sativaxmicrobiology1 aBrussel, A.A.N. van1 aKijne, J.W.0 tMolecular plant-microbe interactions.g2005 Nov., v. 18, no. 11 p.1123-1129wJournal:jnl43555x0894-02827nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094/MPMI-18-11233Available from publisher's Web site  a20080326b20080404c00000000  aINDdRSCe2005/11/12  aOther US 7aarticle03297naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134072000900152072000900161072000900170100002600179245011100205300001600316500002400332500001500356520156500371650002001936650002401956650001601980650000801996650001002004650003502014650001902049650002202068650001402090650001502104650002302119650002002142650002502162650001502187650003402202650002402236650001202260653002802272653001502300700001602315700001802331700001202349700002202361700003002383773012402413852000902537856009202546930003302638945002502671946001102696655001202707IND4417628220221121231509.0090313e200904  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441762822DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-277X.2008.00931.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aT000 0aT300 0aX3801 aSánchez-Villegas, A.10aAssociation between folate, vitamin B₆ and vitamin B₁₂ intake and depression in the SUN cohort study  ap. 122-133.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aAn association between low blood levels of folate, vitamins B₆ and B₁₂ and a higher prevalence of depressive symptoms has been reported in several epidemiological studies. The present study aimed to assess the association between folate, vitamins B₆ and B₁₂ intake and depresion prevalence in the SUN cohort study. The study comprised a cross-sectional analysis of 9670 participants. A validated semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire was used to ascertain vitamin intake. The association between the baseline intake of folate, vitamins B₆ and B₁₂ categorised in quintiles and the prevalence of depression was assessed. The analyses were repeated after stratifying by smoking habits, alcohol intake, physical activity and personality traits. Among women, odds ratios (OR) [95% confidence interval (CI)] for the third to fifth quintile for vitamin B₁₂ intake were 0.58 (0.41-0.84), 0.56 (0.38-0.82) and 0.68 (0.45-1.04), respectively. Among those men with a low level of anxiety and current smokers, a significant positive association between low folate intake and the prevalence of depression was found. The OR (95% CI) for the first quintile of intake was 2.85 (1.49-5.45) and 2.18 (1.08-4.38), respectively, compared to the upper quintiles of intake (Q2-Q5) considered as a group. Low folate intake was associated with depression among currently smoking men and men with low anxiety levels. Low intake of vitamin B₁₂ was associated with depression among women. No significant associations were found for vitamin B₆ intake. 3anutrient intake 3amathematical models 3avitamin B12 3amen 3awomen 3anutrient-nutrient interactions 3acohort studies 3aphysical activity 3alifestyle 3apyridoxine 3agender differences 3asmoking (habit) 3apsychosocial factors 3afolic acid 3afood frequency questionnaires 3adietary supplements 3aanxiety 0aepidemiological studies 0adepression1 aDoreste, J.1 aSchlatter, J.1 aPla, J.1 aBes-Rastrollo, M.1 aMartínez-González, M.A.0 tJournal of human nutrition and dietetics.g2009 Apr., v. 22, no. 2 p.122-133dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0952-38717nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-277X.2008.00931.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20090506b20090608c00000000  aINDd6CTe2009/04/10  aNon-US 7aarticle03122naa a2200697 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024001800097040001800115100001500133245018500148300001600333520109700349650000901446650002501455650001601480650001701496650002001513650001601533650002801549650002901577650002101606650001701627650001001644650002001654650003301674650001001707650002701717650002001744650004901764650002801813650002801841650003101869650000901900650001101909650001101920650004801931650001401979650001601993650002702009650001702036650002502053650001602078651001302094700001602107700001902123700001802142700001202160700001902172700001802191700001602209700001502225773009602240852001302336939003302349945000802382946001302390852000902403655001202412991581927940742620221121231444.0920402e199202  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI920010152DNAL7 a17346762pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCole, T.G.10aDifferential reduction of plasma cholesterol by the American Heart Association Phase 3 Diet in moderately hypercholesterolemic, premenopausal women with different body mass indexes  ap. 385-394.  aThe ability of a low-fat, low-cholesterol diet to improve the risk-factor profiles of moderately hypercholesterolemic, premenopausal women was evaluated. Nineteen women were fed a typical American diet for 1 mo, after which a low-fat diet consisting of 21% of total energy (en%) as fat, 59 en% carbohydrates, 19 en% protein, and 96 mg cholesterol/d (P:S 1.8) was given. After 5 months, total and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol was decreased by 7% and 11%, respectively, and total triglycerides increased by approximately 30%. High-density-lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol was decreased by 12% at month 2 and 5% at month 5 (P < 0.05). Although HDL2 cholesterol decreased progressively throughout the diet period to -35% by month 5, HDL3 cholesterol, which decreased to -5% at month 1, increased to +7% by month 5. Of the plasma apolipoproteins only apo A-II was altered (+ 15%) by the diet. Body mass index correlated to baseline values and affected response to diet; only the leanest women had significant decreases in total, LDL, and HDL2 cholesterol in response to the low-fat diet. 3adiet 3ahypercholesterolemia 3abody weight 3adiet therapy 3anutrient intake 3acholesterol 3alow density lipoprotein 3ahigh density lipoprotein 3atriacylglycerols 3ablood plasma 3awomen 3aapolipoproteins 3avery low density lipoprotein 2aAdult 2aApolipoproteinsxblood 2aBody Mass Index 2aCholesterolxadministration & dosagexblood. 2aCholesterol, HDLxblood 2aCholesterol, LDLxblood 2aCoronary Diseasexetiology 2aDiet 2aFemale 2aHumans 2aHypercholesterolemiaxbloodxcomplications. 2aMenopause 2aMiddle Aged 2aObesityxcomplications 2aRisk Factors 2aTriglyceridesxblood 2aWeight Loss 3aIllinois1 aBowen, P.E.1 aSchmeisser, D.1 aPrewitt, T.E.1 aAye, P.1 aLangenberg, P.1 aDolecek, T.A.1 aBrace, L.D.1 aKamath, S.0 tAmerican journal of clinical nutrition.g1992 Feb., v. 55, no. 2 p.385-394x0002-91657nnas  aDNAL FNC  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aFNC  aOther US  aDNAL 7aarticle03304naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001700152245009700169300001600266500002400282520220000306650001702506650001402523650002002537650001302557650001402570650001302584650001102597650002302608650001002631700002102641700002002662700002402682700002102706773010202727852000902829856009202838655001202930IND4449195020221121220545.0110211s2011    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444919502DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-2427.2010.02520.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPARRA, IRENE10aOntogenetic variation in density-dependent growth of brown trout through habitat competition  ap. 530-540.  aIncludes references  a1. Density-dependent growth has been widely reported in freshwater fishes, but the ontogenetic evolution of competition and its subsequent effects on growth through a life span remains unclear. 2. Patterns of competition can be described by integrating population abundance data with habitat-modelling results. Weighted usable area (WUA; m² WUA ha⁻¹) curves are obtained for each flow value and are then coupled with demographic data to obtain the occupancy rates (trout m⁻² WUA, the density of a given age class related to its suitable habitat) of the WUA for every age class, year and site. 3. We examined a long-term data series searching for temporal variation in the influence of habitat occupancy rate on the growth of brown trout Salmo trutta. We tested whether (i) mean cohort mass (mean mass of the cohort during the first 3 years of life) is affected by the occupancy rate experienced across a life span; and (ii) the occupancy rate experienced at different ages influenced mean body size. 4. We observed a consistent negative power relationship between average cohort mass and mean occupancy rate through a life span, indicating that stronger cohorts were related to a reduced growth, with likely consequences for individual fitness. 5. The effects of occupancy rate on size-at-age were mainly detected in the size attained at the second year of life, but they were because of the competition at different times. Thus, the level of competition varied through ontogeny, in some of the rivers affecting growth since the first year of life, whereas in most of the rivers the main effects on body size resulted from the competition during the second year of life. 6. Occupancy rate appears more appropriate than density for assessing the occurrence of habitat competition in freshwater fishes, since it encompasses the differences in quantity and quality of suitable habitat for each age class. 7. Our study highlights the importance of density-dependent growth as a key process in the dynamics of brown trout populations, its temporal variation depending on the temporal changes of density and the variation of competition associated with the habitat capacity for each life stage. 3aSalmo trutta 3abody size 3afreshwater fish 3ahabitats 3alongevity 3aontogeny 3arivers 3atemporal variation 3atrout1 aAlmodóvar, Ana.1 aAYLLÓN, DANIEL1 aNICOLA, GRACIELA G.1 aElvira, Benigno.0 tFreshwater biology.g2011 Mar., v. 56, no. 3 p.530-540dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0046-50707nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2427.2010.02520.x3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02527naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003000092040001800122072001700140100001700157245014300174300001800317520127600335650002501611650001901636650002801655650002301683650003101706650003201737650003801769650003601807650003001843650002301873773009701896852000901993856008002002930003302082945002502115946001302140655001202153IND4375561820221121181148.0051027e200510  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437556182DNAL7 a10.1094/MPMI-18-10542doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aGassmann, W.10aNatural variation in the Arabidopsis response to the avirulence gene hopPsyA upcouples the hypersensitive response from disease resistance  ap. 1054-1060.  aThe plant hypersensitive response (HR) is tightly associated with gene-for-gene resistance and has been proposed to function in containing pathogens at the invasion site. This tight association has made it difficult to unequivocally evaluate the importance of HR for plant disease resistance. Here, hopPsyA from Pseudomonas syringae pv. syringae 61 is identified as a new avirulence gene for Arabidopsis that triggers resistance in the absence of macroscopic HR. Resistance to P. syringae pv. tomato DC3000 expressing hopPsyA was EDS1-dependent and NDR1-independent. Intriguingly, several Arabidopsis accessions were resistant to DC3000(hopPsyA) in the absence of HR. This is comparable to the Arabidopsis response to avrRps4, but it is shown that hopPsyA does not signal through RPS4. In a cross between two hopPsyA-resistant accessions that differ in their HR response, the HR segregated as a recessive phenotype regulated by a single locus. This locus, HED1 (HR regulator in EDS1 pathway), is proposed to encode a protein whose activity can cause suppression of the EDS1-dependent HR signaling pathway. HED1-regulated symptomless gene-for-gene resistance responses may explain some cases of Arabidopsis resistance to bacteria that are classified as nonhost resistance. 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3aplant response 3ahypersensitive response 3adisease resistance 3agene-for-gene relationship 3ahost-pathogen relationships 3aPseudomonas syringae pv. syringae 3aPseudomonas syringae pv. tomato 3aplant pathogenic bacteria 3abacterial proteins0 tMolecular plant-microbe interactions.g2005 Oct., v. 18, no. 10 p.1054-1060x0894-02827nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094/MPMI-18-10543Available from publisher's Web site  a20080321b20080404c00000000  aINDdRSCe2005/11/04  aOther US 7aarticle02626naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002300152245008400175300001600259500002400275520148800299650002601787650001401813650001001827650001101837650001301848650001501861650001001876650000901886650001801895650002601913650001601939650001501955650001301970651001201983700003001995773010202025852000902127856009202136655001202228IND4449194920221121181145.0110211s2011    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444919492DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-2427.2010.02519.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCHIANDET, AISHA S.10aLandscape controls on seston stoichiometry in urban stormwater management ponds  ap. 519-529.  aIncludes references  a1. Stormwater management ponds (SWMPs) are taking the place of natural ponds and wetlands in urban areas. SWMPs have the potential to serve as hotspots for nutrient cycling, yet little is known about how urban catchments affect nutrient chemistry and stoichiometry within these ponds. 2. We sampled 50 SWMPs in Southern Ontario, Canada, to characterise their seston stoichiometry and make comparisons with published lake and pond data and models of seston stoichiometry. We tested (i) whether C : N : P ratios were similar to natural ponds and small lakes, (ii) whether seston stoichiometry was scale dependent and (iii) whether variability in seston chemistry could be explained by landscape and pond characteristics, such as catchment imperviousness and hydrological condition (based on recently received rainfall). 3. Seston C : N and C : P ratios were significantly lower in SWMPs than published ratios for small lakes, likely because of high nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations in SWMPs. Our results also showed no dependency of stoichiometric ratios on pond size. Analyses of ratios versus landscape and pond characteristics revealed significant relationships only when ponds were grouped based on the hydrological condition of the catchments. 4. It is likely that SWMPs function very differently during wet and dry periods. When SWMPs are disconnected from the landscape after a lengthy dry period, internal processes become increasingly important for seston stoichiometry. 3abiogeochemical cycles 3ahydrology 3alakes 3amodels 3anitrogen 3aphosphorus 3aponds 3arain 3astoichiometry 3astormwater management 3aurban areas 3awatersheds 3awetlands 3aOntario1 aXENOPOULOS, MARGUERITE A.0 tFreshwater biology.g2011 Mar., v. 56, no. 3 p.519-529dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0046-50707nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2427.2010.02519.x3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02892naa a2200613 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092024002200134024001900156040001800175072000900193100002200202245012300224300001500347500002400362500001500386506007600401520101800477506003701495650002201532650001901554650001101573650001201584650002001596650002001616650000901636650001101645650002501656650001601681650002701697650001501724650001301739653001901752653001801771653002401789653002001813653001501833700002301848700001901871700002201890700002101912700001901933700002101952700001801973773010501991852000902096856009202105930003302197945002502230946001102255655001202266IND4417630220221207065228.0090313e200904  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441763022DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-3164.2008.00692.x2doi7 aPMC29561832pmcid7 a191755642pmid  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL8101 aSundberg, John P.10aRecombinant human hepatitis B vaccine initiating alopecia areata: testing the hypothesis using the C3H/HeJ mouse model  ap. 99-104.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aUntoward effects of human vaccines suggest that recombinant hepatitis B vaccine may induce alopecia areata (AA) in some patients. Similar untoward immunological effects may also account for AA-like diseases in domestic species. In this study, the C3H/HeJ spontaneous adult onset AA mouse model was used to test the role, if any, of recombinant hepatitis B vaccine on the initiation or activation of AA. Initial experiments demonstrated no effect on induction of AA in young adult female C3H/HeJ mice (P = 0.5689). By contrast, older females, those at the age when AA first begins to appear in this strain, had a significant increase (P = 0.0264) in the time of onset of AA, suggesting that the vaccine may initiate disease in mice predisposed to AA. However, larger vaccine trials, which included diphtheria and tetanus toxoids as additional controls, did not support these initial result findings and suggest that AA associated with vaccination may be within the normal background levels of the given population.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aHepatitis B virus 3ahuman diseases 3ahumans 3atetanus 3aadverse effects 3aviral hepatitis 3amice 3aadults 3arecombinant vaccines 3avaccination 3arecombinant antibodies 3aanimal age 3aalopecia 0atetanus toxoid 0aadult animals 0aimmunologic factors 0aalopecia areata 0adiphtheria1 aSilva, Kathleen A.1 aZhang, Weidong1 aSundberg, Beth A.1 aEdwards, Kathryn1 aKing, Lloyd E.1 aDavis, Robert L.1 aBlack, Steven0 tVeterinary dermatology.g2009 Apr., v. 20, no. 2 p.99-104dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0959-44937nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-3164.2008.00692.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20090506b20090608c00000000  aINDd6CTe2009/04/15  aNon-US 7aarticle03712naa a2200721 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003000111040001800141072001700159100002000176245011400196300001800310500001500328520136200343650003001705650001301735650002701748650001201775650003201787650003001819650002501849650001401874650002501888650001001913650004301923650006801966650001202034650003302046650004602079650001802125650003502143650003702178650003902215650002902254650002102283650003502304650004002339650001302379650003002392650003102422650003902453650002402492653002302516653002802539653003002567653001902597700001402616700001402630700001302644700001602657700001402673700001602687773011502703852000902818856008002827930003302907945002502940946001302965655001202978IND4374130720221121181143.0050909e200509  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437413072DNAL7 a161677702pmid7 a10.1094/MPMI-18-10022doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

The bacteria also colonize roots grown in sterile quartz sand. Attachment, root colonization, and biofilm formation all were markedly reduced in celA and chvB mutants, deficient in production of cellulose and cyclic β-(1,2)-D-glucans, respectively. We have identified two genes (celG and celI) in which mutations result in the overproduction of cellulose as judged by chemical fractionation and methylation analysis. Wild-type and chvB mutant strains carrying a cDNA clone of a cellulose synthase gene from the marine urochordate Ciona savignyi also overproduced cellulose. The overproduction in a wild-type strain resulted in increased biofilm formation on roots, as evaluated by light microscopy, and levels of root colonization intermediate between those of cellulose-minus mutants and the wild type. Overproduction of cellulose by a nonattaching chvB mutant restored biofilm formation and bacterial attachment in microscopic and viable cell count assays and partially restored root colonization. Although attachment to plant surfaces was restored, overproduction of cellulose did not restore virulence in the chvB mutant strain, suggesting that simple bacterial binding to plant surfaces is not sufficient for pathogenesis. 3aplant pathogenic bacteria 3atomatoes 3abacterial colonization 3abiofilm 3ahost-pathogen relationships 3aAgrobacterium radiobacter 3amicrobial physiology 3acellulose 3anucleotide sequences 3aroots 3aSolanum lycopersicum var. lycopersicum 2aAgrobacterium tumefaciensxgeneticsxpathogenicityxphysiology. 2aAnimals 2aBacterial Adhesionxgenetics 2aBacterial Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aBase Sequence 2aBiofilmsxgrowth & development 2aCellulasexgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aCellulosexbiosynthesisxgenetics. 2aDNA, Bacterialxgenetics 2aGenes, Bacterial 2aGlucosyltransferasesxgenetics 2aSolanum lycopersicumxmicrobiology. 2aMutation 2aPlant Rootsxmicrobiology 2aPlant Tumorsxmicrobiology 2aUrochordataxenzymologyxgenetics. 2aVirulencexgenetics 0acellulose synthase 0amolecular sequence data 0aAgrobacterium tumefaciens 0aCiona savignyi1 aMarry, M.1 aKrall, L.1 aKaye, M.1 aRamey, B.E.1 aFuqua, C.1 aWhite, A.R.0 tMolecular plant-microbe interactions.g2005 Sept., v. 18, no. 9 p.1002-1010wJournal:jnl43555x0894-02827nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094/MPMI-18-10023Available from publisher's Web site  a20080625b20080704c00000000  aINDdRSCe2005/11/07  aOther US 7aarticle02885naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003000111040001800141072001700159100001800176245012300194300001800317520092500335650002601260650001201286650001901298650002601317650002801343650002001371650002801391650001401419650003301433650002301466650005001489650002701539650005001566650004101616650005001657650002001707650003301727650002001760650003501780650005101815653003701866653004201903700001501945700001301960700001501973700001401988700001802002773011502020852000902135856008002144930003302224945002502257946001302282655001202295IND4375561220221121181158.0051027e200510  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437556122DNAL7 a162552412pmid7 a10.1094/MPMI-18-10272doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aMenke, F.L.H.10aTobacco transcription factor WRKY1 is phosphorylated by the MAP kinase SIPK and mediates HR-like cell death in tobacco  ap. 1027-1034.  aThe salicylic acid-induced protein kinase (SIPK) of tobacco, which is a mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), is activated by various biotic and abiotic treatments. Overexpression of SIPK has been shown to trigger cell death. In this study, a targeted yeast two-hybrid approach identified the tobacco transcription factor WRKY1 as a potential substrate. SIPK phosphorylated WRKY1, which resulted in enhanced DNA-binding activity of WRKY1 to its cognate binding site, a W box sequence from the tobacco chitinase gene CHN50. SIPK-mediated enhancement of WRKY1 DNA-binding activity was inhibited by staurosporine, a general kinase inhibitor. Co-expression of SIPK and WRKY1 in Nicotiana benthamiana led to more rapid cell death than expression of SIPK alone, suggesting that WRKY1 is involved in the formation of hypersensitive response-like cell death and may be a component of the signaling cascade downstream of SIPK. 3aNicotiana benthamiana 3atobacco 3aplant proteins 3atranscription factors 3aprotein phosphorylation 3aprotein kinases 3ahypersensitive response 3aapoptosis 3aprotein-protein interactions 3aplant biochemistry 2aArabidopsis Proteinsxmetabolismxphysiology. 2aCell Deathxphysiology 2aDNA-Binding Proteinsxmetabolismxphysiology. 2aElectrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay 2aMitogen-Activated Protein Kinasesxmetabolism 2aPhosphorylation 2aPlants, Genetically Modified 2aProtein Binding 2aTobaccoxcytologyxmetabolism. 2aTranscription Factorsxmetabolismxphysiology. 0amitogen-activted protein kinases 0asalicylic acid-induced protein kinase1 aKang, H.G.1 aChen, Z.1 aPark, J.M.1 aKumar, D.1 aKlessig, D.F.0 tMolecular plant-microbe interactions.g2005 Oct., v. 18, no. 10 p.1027-1034wJournal:jnl43555x0894-02827nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094/MPMI-18-10273Available from publisher's Web site  a20080321b20080404c00000000  aINDdRSCe2005/11/04  aOther US 7aarticle02610naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002600152245012600178300001600304500002400320520137100344650001201715650001101727650000901738650001101747650002201758650001001780650001801790650001101808650001301819650001901832650001901851650002001870650001201890650001401902650001001916651001101926700001801937700001801955773010201973852000902075856009202084655001202176IND4449194520221121181214.0110211s2011    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444919452DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-2427.2010.02512.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLEBERFINGER, KAROLINA14aThe importance of terrestrial resource subsidies for shredders in open-canopy streams revealed by stable isotope analysis  ap. 470-480.  aIncludes references  a1. Allochthonous detritus is the major source of energy in forested streams, but less is known of the importance of terrestrial subsidies to open-canopy streams. Here, we used stable isotope analysis to assess the importance of allochthonous versus autochthonous energy sources to invertebrate shredders in four open-canopy streams in Sweden. Shredders and potential food sources were analysed at both open sites and those with deciduous trees in the riparian zone. 2. Mixing models showed that allochthonous coarse particulate organic matter was the most important energy source to shredders at both the open and wooded sites, suggesting that terrestrial subsidies may be an important process in open-canopy streams, just as they are in forested streams. 3. However, shredders at open sites had a larger proportion of biofilm in their diet than at wooded sites, indicating an ability of shredders to adjust their diet with food availability. 4. We also used the carbon and nitrogen stable isotope signatures to assess the size of the feeding niche of shredders. Feeding on both allochthonous and autochthonous sources at open sites was reflected in a larger feeding niche than at wooded sites for one of the three species analysed. There was substantial overlap of the feeding niche among shredder species, indicating a high functional redundancy within this guild. 3abiofilm 3acarbon 3adiet 3aenergy 3afood availability 3afoods 3ainvertebrates 3amodels 3anitrogen 3aorganic matter 3ariparian areas 3astable isotopes 3astreams 3asubsidies 3atrees 3aSweden1 aBOHMAN, IRENE1 aHERRMANN, JAN0 tFreshwater biology.g2011 Mar., v. 56, no. 3 p.470-480dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0046-50707nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2427.2010.02512.x3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03194naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003800111040001800149100001300167245014000180300001600320500002400336520141400360650001601774650001801790650001301808650001101821650001001832650002001842650001301862650002601875650000901901650000901910650003501919650003701954650001201991650001202003650002902015650002602044650003802070650003602108650004102144650002002185650001302205650005002218650000902268650005802277650003602335700001502371700001502386700001602401700001202417773009002429852000902519856008802528655001202616IND4449389920221121151112.0110215s2010    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444938992DNAL7 a210580632pmid7 a10.1080/00071668.2010.5084862doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYe, M.H.10aCorrelation between polymorphisms in ADSL and GARS-AIRS-GART genes with inosine 5'-monophosphate (IMP) contents in Beijing-you chickens  ap. 609-613.  aIncludes references  a1. The association of single nucleotide polymorphisms identified within the ADSL (adenylosuccinate lyase deficiency) gene and GARS-AIRS-GART (glycinamide ribonucleotide synthetase-aminoimidazole ribonucleotide synthetase-glycinamide ribonucleotide transformylase) gene with the content of inosine 5'-monophosphate (IMP) was studied in a population of male Beijing-you (BJY) chickens slaughtered at 90 d of age. 2. A single nucleotide polymorphism in exon 2 of the ADSL gene had an effect on IMP content. Chickens inheriting the positive allele at ADSL, both homozygous and heterozygous genotypes, had a higher content of IMP in breast muscle than did individuals without it. 3. Similar results were obtained for the GARS-AIRS-GART gene. The marker at the 5' untranslated region (UTR) of the GARS-AIRS-GART gene was also significant for the IMP value. Chickens inheriting the genotypes with the positive allele at this locus had a much higher content of IMP than did those homozygous for the unfavourable one. 4. Interactions between ADSL and GARS-AIRS-GART were detected for such traits as body weight and muscle yields in the tested population. The two loci acted in an additive fashion. Because IMP is one of the most important flavour components in meat, markers developed at these two genes, as well as the combination genotypes, could be used as potential molecular markers for improving chicken quality. 3abody weight 3abreast muscle 3achickens 3aflavor 3agenes 3agenetic markers 3agenotype 3ainosine monophosphate 3aloci 3ameat 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism 2aAdenylosuccinate Lyasexgenetics 2aAlleles 2aAnimals 2aAvian Proteinsxgenetics 2aBody Weightxgenetics 2aCarbon-Nitrogen Ligasesxgenetics 2aChickensxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aChromatography, High Pressure Liquid 2aGenetic Markers 2aGenotype 2aInosine Monophosphatexchemistryxmetabolism. 2aMale 2aPhosphoribosylglycinamide Formyltransferasexgenetics 2aPolymorphism, Single Nucleotide1 aChen, J.L.1 aZhao, G.P.1 aZheng, M.Q.1 aWen, J.0 tBritish poultry science.g2010 Oct., v. 51, no. 5 p.609-613dLongmanx0007-16687nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00071668.2010.5084863Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03110naa a2200613 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003800111040001800149100001600167245015800183300001600341500002400357520118800381650001101569650001301580650001601593650001001609650000901619650001101628650002201639650002601661650001301687650001001700650001201710650001301722650002001735650001201755650001201767650002701779650003001806650005701836650003901893650004001932650003601972650003802008650002502046650002202071650002602093650002402119650002902143650004602172650002602218700001302244700001102257700001602268700001302284773009002297852000902387856008802396655001202484IND4449389720221121113017.0110215s2010    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444938972DNAL7 a210580622pmid7 a10.1080/00071668.2010.5203032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTangara, M.10aEffects of in ovo feeding of carbohydrates and arginine on hatchability, body weight, energy metabolism and perinatal growth in duck embryos and neonates  ap. 602-608.  aIncludes references  a1. The objective of this study was to test the hypothesis that in ovo feeding of carbohydrates and arginine into the duck amnion may improve the glycogen store and perinatal growth. At 23 d of incubation, fertile eggs were injected with 1·2 ml of sodium chloride (NaCl), sucrose + maltose (CHO), arginine (Arg) or sucrose + maltose + arginine (CHO + Arg), with controls not injected. Body weight, liver and muscle glycogen levels, and hepatic glucose-6-phosphatase activity were determined at 25 d of incubation, at hatch, and at 3 and 7 d posthatch. 2. At hatch and 7 d of age, the body weights were greater in the in ovo-feeding treatments than the controls. Arg and CHO + Arg significantly enhanced liver glycogen level at hatch compared with controls. CHO and CHO + Arg significantly increased muscle glycogen level at 25 d of incubation over controls. CHO and Arg decreased glucose-6-phosphatase at 25 d of incubation, whereas NaCl and CHO + Arg increased glucose-6-phosphatase at hatch relative to controls. 3. In ovo feeding of carbohydrates and arginine at 23 d of incubation may improve glycogen reserves, which may, in turn, provide the energy needed for perinatal growth. 3aamnion 3aarginine 3abody weight 3aducks 3aeggs 3aenergy 3aenergy metabolism 3aglucose-6-phosphatase 3aglycogen 3aliver 3amaltose 3aneonates 3asodium chloride 3asucrose 2aAnimals 2aArgininexpharmacology 2aBody Weightxdrug effects 2aDucksxembryologyxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aEmbryo, Nonmammalianxdrug effects 2aEmbryonic Developmentxdrug effects 2aEnergy Metabolismxdrug effects 2aGlucose-6-Phosphatasexmetabolism 2aGlycogenxmetabolism 2aLiverxmetabolism 2aMaltosexpharmacology 2aMusclesxmetabolism 2aOrgan Sizexdrug effects 2aOvumxdrug effectsxgrowth & development. 2aSucrosexpharmacology1 aChen, W.1 aXu, J.1 aHuang, F.R.1 aPeng, J.0 tBritish poultry science.g2010 Oct., v. 51, no. 5 p.602-608dLongmanx0007-16687nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00071668.2010.5203033Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03283naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003000092040001800122072001700140072001700157100001800174245016200192300001700354500001500371520157100386650002801957650001601985650002002001650003002021650002202051650001402073650001302087650001602100650002902116650003002145650002702175650002202202650002002224650002002244650002102264650002302285653003002308653002802338653002502366653003002391700001502421700001502436700002202451773009602473852000902569856008002578930003302658945002502691946001302716655001202729IND4374130520221121112957.0050909e200509  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437413052DNAL7 a10.1094/MPMI-18-09912doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aRezzonico, F.14aThe type III secretion system of biocontrol Pseudomonas fluorescens KD targets and phytopathogenic chromista Pythium ultimum and promotes cucumber protection  ap. 991-1001.  a2019-12-04  aThe type III secretion system (TTSS) is used by Proteobacteria for pathogenic or symbiotic interaction with plant and animal hosts. Recently, TTSSgenes thought to originate from the phytopathogen Pseudomonas syringae were evidenced in Pseudomonas fluorescens KD, which protects cucumber from the oomycete Pythium ultimum (kingdom Chromista/Stramenopila). However, it is not known whether te TTSS contributes to plant protection by the bacterium and, if so, whether it targets the plant or the phytopathogen. Inactivation of TTSS gene hrcV following the insertion of an omega cassette strongly reduced the biocontrol activity of the pseudomonad against P. ultimum on cucumber when compared with the wild type, but had no effect on its root-colonization ability. Analysis of a plasmid-based transcriptional hrpJ'-inaZ reporter fusion revealed that expression in strain KD of the operon containing hrcV was strongly stimulated in vitro and in situ by the oomycete and not by the plant. In vitro, both strain KD and its hrcV mutant reduced the activity level of the pectinase polygalacturonase (a key pathogenicity factor) from P. ultimum, but the reduction was much stronger with the wild type. Together, these results show that the target range of bacterial TTSS is not restricted to plants and animals but also can include members of Chromista/Stramenopila, and suggest that virulence genes acquired horizontally from phytopathogenic bacteria were functionally recycled in biocontrol saprophytic Pseudomonas spp., resulting in enhanced plant protection by the latter. 3aPseudomonas fluorescens 3adamping off 3aCucumis sativus 3abiological control agents 3apolygalacturonase 3acucumbers 3amutation 3ahost plants 3atranscription (genetics) 3atype III secretion system 3aplant pathogenic fungi 3amolecular cloning 3aenzyme activity 3aPythium ultimum 3apromoter regions 3abiological control 0afungal diseases of plants 0amolecular sequence data 0anucleotide sequences 0aType III secretion system1 aBinder, C.1 aDefago, G.1 aMoenne-Loccoz, Y.0 tMolecular plant-microbe interactions.g2005 Sept., v. 18, no. 9 p.991-1001x0894-02827nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094/MPMI-18-09913Available from publisher's Web site  a20080625b20080704c00000000  aINDdRSCe2005/11/07  aOther US 7aarticle04637naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002200152245011900174300001600293500002400309520339200333650001303725650002903738650002003767650001503787650000903802650001203811650001303823650002003836650001303856650002203869650002303891650001103914650001803925650001203943650001503955651001303970700002903983773010204012852000904114856009204123655001204215IND4449195620221121112930.0110211s2011    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444919562DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-2427.2010.02522.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMALONEY, KELLY O.10aAnthropogenic disturbance and streams: land use and land-use change affect stream ecosystems via multiple pathways  ap. 611-626.  aIncludes references  a1. Ecosystems are strongly influenced by land use practices. However, identifying the mechanisms behind these influences is complicated by the many potential pathways (often indirect) between land use and ecosystems and by the long-lasting effects of past land use. To support ecosystem restoration and conservation efforts, we need to better understand these indirect and lasting effects. 2. We constructed structural equation models (SEM) to evaluate the direct and indirect effects of contemporary (2002) land use (agriculture and development) and change in land use from 1952 to 2002 on present-day streams (n = 190) in Maryland, U.S.A. Additional variables examined included site location, system size, altitude, per cent sand in soils, riparian condition, habitat quality, stream water NO₃-N and benthic macroinvertebrate and fish measures of stream condition. Our first SEM (2002 Land Use) included the proportions of contemporary agriculture and development in catchments in the model. The second SEM (Land Use Change) included five measures of land use change (proportion agricultural in both times, developed in both times, agricultural in 1952 and developed in 2002, forested in 1952 and developed in 2002 and agricultural in 1952 and forested in 2002). 3. The data set fit both SEMs well. The 2002 Land Use model explained 71% of variation in NO₃-N and 55%, 42% and 38% of variation in riffle quality, macroinvertebrate condition and fish condition, respectively. The Land Use Change model explained similar amounts of variation in NO₃-N (R² = 0.72), riffle quality (R² = 0.57) and macroinvertebrate condition (R² = 0.44) but slightly more variation in fish condition (R² = 0.43). 4. Both models identified pathways through which landscape variables affect stream responses, including negative direct effects of latitude on macroinvertebrate and fish conditions and positive direct and indirect effects of altitude on NO₃-N, riffle quality and macroinvertebrate and fish conditions. The 2002 Land Use model showed contemporary development and agriculture had positive total effects on NO₃-N (both through direct pathways); contemporary development had negative effects on macroinvertebrate condition. The Land Use Change model showed that contemporary developed land that was forested in 1952 had no effects on NO₃-N; current developed land that was developed or agricultural in 1952 showed positive effects on NO₃-N. Forests that were agricultural in 1952 had negative effects on NO₃-N, suggesting reduced NO₃-N export with reforestation. The Land Use Change model also showed negative total effects of all types of contemporary developed land (developed, agricultural or forested in 1952) on benthic condition. Developed land that was forested in 1952 had negative effects on fish condition. Forest sites that were agricultural in 1952 had negative effects on fish and macroinvertebrate conditions, suggesting a long-term imprint of abandoned agriculture in stream communities. 5. Our analyses (i) identified multiple indirect effects of contemporary land use on streams, (ii) showed that current land uses with different land use histories can exhibit different effects on streams and (iii) demonstrated an imprint of land use lasting >50 years. Knowledge of these indirect and long-term effects of land use will help to conserve and restore streams. 3aaltitude 3aanthropogenic activities 3adata collection 3aecosystems 3afish 3aforests 3ahabitats 3aland use change 3alatitude 3along term effects 3amacroinvertebrates 3amodels 3areforestation 3astreams 3awatersheds 3aMaryland1 aWeller, Donq(Donald E.)0 tFreshwater biology.g2011 Mar., v. 56, no. 3 p.611-626dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0046-50707nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2427.2010.02522.x3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle04440naa a2200625 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131072000900149072000900158072000900167072000900176100001900185245012500204300001600329500002400345500001500369520265500384650001503039650002003054650002003074650001603094650001003110650001503120650002803135650001103163650001703174650001403191650000903205650002603214650002003240650003103260650001603291650002203307650002003329650001803349650002203367650000903389653001703398653002603415653001103441653001803452700002003470700002003490700002303510773010203533852000903635856008903644930003303733945002503766946001103791655001203802IND4443513220221121085921.0101015e20101029xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444351322DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scienta.2010.08.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF110 0aF600 0aB200 0aF2001 aRaviv, Michael10aDevelopment of alternate cut-flower rose greenhouse temperature set-points based on calorimetric plant tissue evaluation  ap. 454-461.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aEnergy utilization for heating is one of the most expensive greenhouse climate control operations. The temperature set-point is determined by many interrelated environmental, physiological, and economic factors but is fundamentally driven by the required growth rate of the plant or crop for quality and profitability. Temperatures are maintained to maximize production and affect timing of harvest of greenhouse-grown crops. In general, winter greenhouse environments for most cut-flower roses are heated to a target temperature of 16-18°C. For rose, such temperature targets are based on grower experience along with horticultural research and should be considered a compromise across all factors. In the current research we studied the concept of “potential growth rate” (PGR), based on a thermodynamic growth model and how PGR relates to the typical temperature recommendation (TTR) for set-points for greenhouse heating and cooling in commercial horticultural production. PGR of specific growing organs (leaves, shoot tips, roots, etc) can be deduced using calorespirometric measurements in relation to various environmental factors such as temperature effect on biomass production. This research consisted of two facets: (1) determination of cultivar-specific alternate TTRs based on calorimetric PGR measurement and then (2) testing these TTRs in greenhouse rose flower production. The results of this study suggested that TTRs for the cultivar ‘Kardinal' can be lowered at the time of bud emergence, when this cultivar can tolerate a lower temperature. Also, since the cultivar ‘Milva' can tolerate lower temperature at time of leaflet unfolding, the current TTR can be adjusted to reflect this. We investigated a set of alternate TTRs by growing rose plants on movable carts and shifting them to various pre-determined night temperature conditions. During the relevant growing stages, half of the plants were given a cold night temperature (14°C) treatment, while control plants were left in the normal greenhouse temperature (18°C). This procedure was repeated for three flushes of flowering rose shoots. Flower shoots were counted and weighed (fresh and dry); shoot length was measured several times per week. It was found that the predictions were valid and (with one exception) no significant effect on the number of flowers, their quality or biomass was caused by this procedure. The implication of this work is that heating cost can be reduced for some rose cultivars by allowing night temperatures to be lower than the typical recommendations for those cultivars that show high metabolic activity at such cooler conditions. 3acrop yield 3acooling systems 3ashoot meristems 3ameasurement 3aroots 3aestimation 3adry matter accumulation 3aleaves 3aharvest date 3acultivars 3abuds 3agreenhouse production 3aair temperature 3aenergy use and consumption 3acut flowers 3anight temperature 3aheating systems 3agrowth models 3agenetic variation 3aRosa 0aoptimization 0apotential growth rate 0ashoots 0aplant tissues1 aMedina, Shlomit1 aWendin, Ceasara1 aLieth, J.

In this study, 80 accessions of Opuntia spp. were collected from Cochabamba and La Paz. The characterization was based on morphological traits using 2-year-old plants that were already well established in the experimental field at the Forage Research Center, Cochabamba. Plant descriptors, with five variables (qualitative and quantitative), and cladode descriptors, with 24 variables (qualitative and quantitative), were considered. Multivariate principal component analysis and cluster analysis showed two groups, both with two sub-established groups; the first group represents accessions with upright, medium and arborescent habitus and the second group represents accessions with spreading and shrubby habitus. The results of the cluster analysis indicate that the two groups obtained are independent of the origin of collection, suggesting that the high diversity of Opuntia spp. is not determined by the zone of collection. The accessions differed with respect to many morphological traits: thicker cladodes; absence of spines, form of plant, serous accession, longest cladode, and large number of cladodes. Other accessions formed a more homogeneous group. The following growth habits were observed in the majority of studied accessions: spreading, shrubby, arbustive, medium and less, upright and arborescent. Four accessions with desirable traits to be used as fodder were identified. The traits considered for use as a forage crop are plants with no or few spines, without disease, long and wide cladode and large number of cladodes. 3aOpuntia 3acladodes 3acluster analysis 3aforage 3aforage crops 3agrowth habit 3aprincipal component analysis 3asemiarid zones 3aBolivia1 aRamirez, K.0 tActa horticulturae.g2019, , no. 1247 p.123-130dInternational Society for Horticultural Science.wJournal:jnl46289x0567-75727nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.17660/ActaHortic.2019.1247.1740uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/6756833  aUSDA  aDNAL 7aarticle02746naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092040001800130072000900148072000900157072000900166100002100175245009700196300001800293500002400311520129700335650001501632650001701647650002101664650001601685650001701701650001801718650002201736650001701758650001501775650002301790650002101813650002201834650001801856650001501874651001101889653002101900700002001921700002101941773011201962852000902074856008802083930003302171945002502204946001102229655001202240IND4443514020221121085920.0101015e20101015xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444351402DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foreco.2010.08.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF600 0aK001 0aX1501 aBuchholz, Thomas10aModeling heliotropic tree growth in hardwood tree species—A case study on Maesopsis eminii  ap. 1656-1663.  aIncludes references  aThere are many impacts during a tree's life that affect bole development. In Maesopsis eminii, a high-potential timber species in Uganda, studies have shown that the occurrence of strongly bent boles is the overwhelming reason that boles fail quality criteria. This observation is incongruous with the tree architecture model of Roux, which describes M. eminii as a tree with a strong apical dominance, meaning that it has a strong genetically based preference for vertical growth of the terminal sprout relative to side branches. As external causes for bent boles could be excluded, we demonstrate in this study the proof of heliotropic growth, i.e. an active bending towards light, for M. eminii beyond the sapling stage. We develop a model used to describe the effects of competition on bole quality using bole form parameters and basic information about the neighbouring trees, and without having to incorporate crown parameters. By means of calculated bole parameters and a mathematical equation to calculate the intensity and direction of competition, we prove the existence of a heliotropic growth reaction. However, we are not able to predict the intensity of this reaction. Finally, general silvicultural recommendations are discussed for tree species with strong heliotropic growth. 3aRhamnaceae 3aforest trees 3atropical forests 3atree growth 3aheliotropism 3agrowth models 3asimulation models 3acase studies 3atree trunk 3aplant architecture 3aapical dominance 3aplant competition 3astand density 3atree crown 3aUganda 0aMaesopsis eminii1 aWeinreich, Axel1 aTennigkeit, Timm0 tForest ecology and management.g2010 Oct. 15, v. 260, no. 10 p.1656-1663dElsevier Sciencex0378-11277nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foreco.2010.08.0013Available from publisher's Web site  a20110112b20110205c00000000  aINDd2CTe2010/12/02  aNon-US 7aarticle02516naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131072000900149072000900158100001900167245009300186300001600279500002400295500001500319520097600334650002101310650001301331650001201344650001101356650001301367650001701380650001601397650001301413650002501426650001401451650001301465650002101478650002101499650002601520650001801546650001301564650001701577650001901594653001801613700001701631700002701648700001801675773010201693852000901795856008901804930003301893945002501926946001101951655001201962IND4443512920221121062507.0101015e20101029xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444351292DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scienta.2010.08.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF110 0aF6001 aMarino, Grazia10aEffect of carbohydrates on in vitro low-temperature storage of shoot cultures of apricot  ap. 434-440.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aProcedures for cold storage of in vitro cultures can delay subculturing, reducing production costs and risks of contamination and somaclonal variation.

The Run1 locus was introgressed from a Muscadinia rotundifolia × Vitis vinifera BC₄ hybrid plant derived from a recurrent pseudo-backcross breeding scheme, whereas the Ren1 locus was introgressed from the powdery mildew-resistant V. vinifera L. variety Kishmish vatkana. Introduction of the Ren1 resistance gene of V. vinifera origin into the breeding program makes possible the long-term defence of the dominant Run1 gene. Using a BC₅ (BC₄ ×Kishmish vatkana) hybrid progeny consisting of 441 plants and applying several SSR and BAC-derived CB markers, we demonstrated that the powdery mildew-resistant phenotype co-segregated with the presence of at least one resistance locus-linked marker in the genome. Our data also corroborated earlier findings that the M. rotundifolia-derived Rpv1 and Run1 loci are closely linked. To further streamline the selection process, we developed a multiplex PCR- and agarose gel electrophoresis-based method for the simultaneous detection of both Run1 and Ren1. The results illustrate that MAS offers a rapid and accurate method to select hybrid genotypes that combine multiple loci of interest in grape. 3adominant genes 3agrapes 3aVitis rotundifolia 3aplant pathogenic fungi 3agenetic markers 3abackcrossing 3amicrosatellite repeats 3ahybrids 3amarker-assisted selection 3agenetic resistance 3apowdery mildew 3adisease resistance 3ainterspecific hybridization 3aVitis vinifera 3aintrogression 3aUncinula necator 3apolymerase chain reaction 3aplant genetic resources 3aplant breeding 3aloci 3abacterial artificial chromosomes 3alinkage (genetics) 0ainheritance (genetics) 0amolecular sequence data 0aresistance genes 0aMuscadinia rotundifolia1 aLencsés, A.K.1 aSzőke, A.1 aVeres, A.1 aHoffmann, S.1 aKozma, P.1 aKovács, L.G.1 aHeszky, L.1 aKiss, E.0 tScientia horticulturae.g2010 Oct. 29, v. 126, no. 4 p.448-453dElsevier Sciencex0304-42387nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scienta.2010.08.0123Available from publisher's Web site  a20110314b20110402c00000000  aINDd2CTe2011/01/06  aNon-US 7aarticle03078naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100002100155245005900176300001600235500020000251520144100451650001401892650002501906650001701931650001701948650001701965650002401982650001502006650001302021650001602034650001702050650001602067650001702083650001102100650001602111650002202127650001502149650001402164650003302178650001002211650002702221650002102248650001102269700001502280700001502295700001602310700001302326773014402339856005602483852000902539655001202548IND60596118120221121053157.0180614e20180404xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059611812DNAL7 a10.17660/ActaHortic.2018.1194.1382doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVenturini, M.

Commercial processing of tropical fruit leads to large amounts of waste products (peels, seeds, kernels and rinds) that can be revalorized. Therefore, the total phenolic and flavonoid content, as well as the antioxidant activity of tropical fruit by-products (mango peel and kernel, rambutan peel, pineapple peel and crown leaf, pitahaya peel, banana peel and cocoa pod husk) have been investigated. Although all the extracts have proven to be interesting sources of bioactive compounds, the rambutan peel showed the highest level of phenolic compounds (10.9 g GAE 100 g-1 d.w. (dry weight)) and antioxidant activity (9.8 g Trolox 100 g-1 dw). Afterwards, the extraction process was modelled and optimized using the response surface methodology (RSM). The conditions that maximized the responses in a Soxhlet extraction were: 50% ethanol:water (v:v), 140°C, and 35 min. The rambutan extracts obtained under these conditions reported up to 17.3 g 100 g-1 dw of gallic acid, 3.2 g catechin 100 g-1 dw, and 12.3 g Trolox 100 g-1 dw, with ellagic acid as the principal benzoic acid with 1.6 g 100 g-1 dw. Moreover, this extract significantly increases the induction period of virgin olive oil in an accelerated stability experiment, showing its potential as a food antioxidant. 3aCactaceae 3aantioxidant activity 3aantioxidants 3abanana peels 3abenzoic acid 3abioactive compounds 3abyproducts 3acatechin 3acocoa hulls 3aellagic acid 3agallic acid 3ahuman health 3aleaves 3amango peels 3anatural resources 3apineapples 3arambutans 3aresponse surface methodology 3aseeds 3asolid phase extraction 3avirgin olive oil 3awastes1 aGimeno, D.1 aFranco, K.1 aRedondo, D.1 aOria, R.0 tActa horticulturae.g2018 Apr. 4, , no. 1194 p.971-978dInternational Society for Horticultural Science.wJournal:jnl46289x0567-75727nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.17660/ActaHortic.2018.1194.138  aDNAL 7aarticle00765naa a2200265 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100001500115245005000130300001600180520005400196650001600250650002200266650001500288653002300303653003000326773007000356852000900426939003300435945000800468946001100476655001200487991581920920742620221121053332.0830415s1982    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aPAR830041222DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLoke, Y.W.10aTransmission of parasites across the placenta  ap. 155-228.  atransmission of parasites across placenta, review 3aTrypanosoma 3aToxoplasma gondii 3aPlasmodium 0aPrenatal infection 0aReproductive organs, Host0 tAdvances in parasitology.g1982, v. 21 p.155-228x0065-308X7nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19830415c00000000  aPAR  aNon-US 7aarticle00918naa a2200301 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100001800115245004400133300001500177520006200192650001800254653003600272653002900308653003200337653003100369653003300400653002000433700002100453773006900474852000900543939003300552945000800585946001100593655001200604991581920780742620221121053254.0830317s1981    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aPAR830027372DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aParshad, V.R.10aAspects of acanthocephalan reproduction  ap. 73-138.  aaspects of acanthocephalan reproduction, extensive review 3agametogenesis 0aAcanthocephala (Acanthocephala) 0aBehavior, Acanthocephala 0aDevelopment, Acanthocephala 0aMorphology, Acanthocephala 0aReproduction, Acanthocephala 0aSex of parasite1 aCrompton, D.W.T.0 tAdvances in parasitology.g1981, v. 19 p.73-138x0065-308X7nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19830317c00000000  aPAR  aNon-US 7aarticle03444naa a2200637 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003600111040001800147072000900165072000900174072000900183072000900192100002600201245015900227300001400386500002400400500001500424520138500439650002101824650002401845650002901869650002401898650002101922650002401943650001101967650002701978650001502005650002002020650001202040650005802052650002002110650002002130650003002150650004302180650004702223650004702270650002902317650002102346653001902367653002002386653002602406653002602432700002002458700001502478700002202493773011502515852000902630856008602639930003302725945002502758946001102783655001202794IND4417545520221121031439.0090312e200901  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441754552DNAL7 a189573222pmid7 a10.1016/j.ibmb.2008.09.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF821 0aL200 0aL001 0aL6001 aBautista, Ma Anita M.10aRNA interference-mediated knockdown of a cytochrome P450, CYP6BG1, from the diamondback moth, Plutella xylostella, reduces larval resistance to permethrin  ap. 38-46.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aWe have previously reported that a cytochrome P450, CYP6BG1, from Plutella xylostella was found to be overexpressed in 4th instars of a permethrin resistant strain and inducible in the susceptible counterpart. The findings suggested potential involvement of CYP6BG1 in permethrin resistance, hence warranted a functional analysis. To assess the functional link of the gene to permethrin resistance, we adopted RNA interference-mediated gene silencing (RNAi) by dsRNA droplet feeding. Here, real time PCR analyses show that oral delivery of dsRNA can efficiently reduce the expression of CYP6BG1. Knockdown of CYP6BG1 transcript was evident in midgut and larval tissues enclosed in carcass. As a consequence of knockdown, a significant reduction in resistance of larvae fed CYP6BG1 dsRNA was observed after 24 and 48 h of exposure to permethrin. In addition, CYP6BG1 dsRNA feeding to larvae led to reduced total P450 activities of microsomal preparations toward model substrates p-nitroanisole and benzyloxyresorufin. These results indicate that the overexpressed CYP6BG1 participate in enhanced metabolism of permethrin, thereby, resistance. The knockdown of a non-overexpressed P450, CYP6BF1v4, from the same resistant P. xylostella strain did not lead to changes in the level of resistance to permethrin, supporting further the specific involvement of CYP6BG1 in the resistance. 3aRNA interference 3agene overexpression 3ametabolic detoxification 3aPlutella xylostella 3acytochrome P-450 3adouble-stranded RNA 3alarvae 3ainsecticide resistance 3apermethrin 3aenzyme activity 2aAnimals 2aCytochrome P-450 Enzyme Systemxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aDrug Resistance 2aGene Expression 2aGene Knockdown Techniques 2aInsect Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aLarvaxdrug effectsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aMothsxdrug effectsxenzymologyxgenetics. 2aPermethrinxpharmacology 2aRNA Interference 0agene silencing 0agene expression 0aresistance mechanisms 0apermethrin resistance1 aMiyata, Tadashi1 aMiura, Ken1 aTanaka, Toshiharu0 tInsect biochemistry and molecular biology.g2009 Jan., v. 39, no. 1 p.38-46dElsevier Sciencex0965-17487nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ibmb.2008.09.0053Available from publisher's Web site  a20090319b20090508c00000000  aINDdNZMe2009/03/17  aNon-US 7aarticle01122naa a2200313 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100002000115245003100135300001400166520029000180650002000470650001700490650002000507650001200527653001900539653001500558653002500573653002300598653002100621773009100642852000900733939003300742945000800775946001300783655001200796991581917910742620221121021213.0800801e197912  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI800000092DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRoach, Faith R.10aFood production management  ap. 39-43.  aA bibliography lists current publications, both general and specific in nature, that emphasize topics in food production management.

Information on K uptake and use efficiency of upland rice under Brazilian conditions is limited. A greenhouse experiment was conducted with the objective to evaluate influence of K on yield, K uptake, and use efficiency of six upland rice genotypes grown on Brazilian Oxisol. The K rate used was zero (natural soil level) and 200 mg K kg-1 of soil. Shoot dry weight and grain yield were significantly influenced by K level and genotype treatments. However, K genotype interactions were not significant, indicating similar responses of genotypes at two K levels for shoot dry weight and grain yield. Genotypes produced grain yield in the order of BRS Primavera > BRA 01596 > BRSMG Curinga > BRS 032033 > BRS Bonana > BRA 02582. Potassium concentration in shoot was about sixfold greater compared to grain, across two K levels and six genotypes. However, K utilization efficiency ratio (KUER) (mg shoot or grain yield / mg K uptake in shoot or root) was about 6.5 times greater in grain compared to shoot, across two K level and six genotypes. Potassium uptake in shoot and grain and KUER were significantly and positively associated with grain yield. Soil calcium (Ca), K, base saturation, acidity saturation, Ca saturation, K saturation, Ca/K ratio, and magnesium (Mg)/K ratio were significantly influenced by K application rate. 3aOxisols 3aapplication rate 3abase saturation 3acalcium 3agenotype 3agrain yield 3agreenhouse experimentation 3amagnesium 3apotassium 3arice 3ashoots1 aSantos, A.B. dos1 aMoraes, M.F. de0 tCommunications in soil science and plant analysis.g2010 , v. 41, no. 20-22 p.2676-2684dDekkerx0010-36247nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle02533naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002500152245015800177300001600335500002400351520137600375650002001751650001401771650002201785650001501807650001701822650001301839653001801852653001701870653002601887773012501913852000902038856009202047930003302139946001102172655001202183IND4417590820221121010222.0090313e200903  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441759082DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1095-8339.2009.00954.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPEDERSEN, HENRIK Æ.10aApochromic populations of Dactylorhiza incarnata s.l.

The study included eight localities with sympatric populations of plants with anthocyanin-pigmented and apochromic flowers. Parallel samples of the two morphs were taken from each locality. Genetic variation was only found at the allozyme loci pgd, pgi and ugpp. Statistically significant differences in allele frequencies between the two colour morphs were found in two localities and demonstrate that the occurrence of apochromic individuals in D. incarnata s.l. is not always because of spontaneous mutation. At least in some localities the apochromic plants form distinct breeding groups (but local populations of different colour morphs may also be composed of several more or less distinct breeding groups). Based on molecular and morphometric data, it is proposed that the apochromic study populations from calcareous fens should be referred to D. incarnata var. ochroleuca, whereas the apochromic study populations from non-calcareous fens are better treated as aberrant local populations of var. incarnata s.l.

Concentration of melon volatiles by steam distillation yielded a product identical to that obtained by hydrolysis of profenofos, identified as 4-bromo-2-chlorophenol. A solution of this compound in water had similar organoleptic properties to that of the contaminated fruits. It was concluded that 4-bromo-2-chlorophenol was responsible for the taint detected in melons. 3amelons 3afood contamination 3aprofenofos 3apesticide residues 3ataint 2aChlorophenolsxanalysis 2aFood Contaminationxanalysis 2aFruitxchemistry 2aGas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry 2aHydrolysis 2aInsecticidesxanalysisxmetabolism. 2aOdorants. 2aOrganothiophosphatesxanalysisxmetabolism. 2aPesticide Residuesxanalysis 0aidentification1 aHerce Garraleta, M.D.1 aCalvo Anton, P.1 aFolgueiras Alonso, M.L.0 tFood additives & contaminants.g1991 , v. 8, no. 5 p.627-632x0265-203X7nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02889naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002400140245009200164300001600256520141800272650003201690650002501722650002101747650001501768650002401783650001501807650002601822650001101848650001401859650001401873650001601887650002201903650002301925650001601948650002901964650001901993650001802012650003702030650001102067700001702078700001702095700003202112700002102144773017102165856004102336961000902377852000902386655001202395IND60741408320221121014152.0210614e202101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074140832DNAL7 a10.4315/JFP-20-2302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEshetea, Behailu B.10aAntibiotic Resistance Characteristics and Prevalence in Kitfo, an Ethiopian Beef Tartar  ap. 152-159.  aKitfo is a version of beef tartar widely consumed in the Ethiopian community. It is made from raw minced beef and a blend of powdered spice and butter. Although previous studies have shown that kitfo contains several bacteria that are of public health concern, the status of their antibiotic resistance is not known. In this study, the antibiotic resistance of bacterial isolates from 26 retail kitfo samples obtained from the Washington metropolitan area was analyzed. Characterization and antibiotic sensitivity of the isolates were determined by the Vitek 2 system and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis was used to delineate the intraspecies variations. Of the isolates, 59% were resistant to two or more antibiotics. Acinetobacter calcoaceticus and Pseudomonas luteola were multidrug resistant to the classes of β-lactam, cephalosporins, and nitrofurantoin. The antibiotic susceptibility profile of the isolates was cefazolin (59%), cefoxitin (50%), ampicillin (32%), and nitrofuran (18%). Most isolates (75%) were Enterobacteriaceae, whereas only 3.8 and 2.6% were Pseudomonadaceae and Moraxellaceae, respectively. Of the Enterobacteriaceae, Enterobacter cloacae, Escherichia coli, and Klebsiella spp. were the most predominant. All isolates except Klebsiella spp. showed high genetic variation (>65%). This study implicates for the first time kitfo as a potential reservoir of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. 3aAcinetobacter calcoaceticus 3aEnterobacter cloacae 3aEscherichia coli 3aKlebsiella 3aPseudomonas luteola 3aampicillin 3aantibiotic resistance 3abutter 3acefazolin 3acefoxitin 3afood safety 3agenetic variation 3ametropolitan areas 3aminced beef 3amultiple drug resistance 3anitrofurantoin 3apublic health 3apulsed-field gel electrophoresis 3aspices1 aAddy, Nicole1 aEwing, Laura1 aBeaubrun, Junia Jean-Gilles1 aEribo, Broderick0 tJournal of food protection.g2021 Jan., v. 84, no. 1 p.152-159dInternational Association of Milk, Food, and Environmental Sanitarians.wJournal:2024x0362-028X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.4315/JFP-20-230  aUSDA  aDNAL 7aarticle02545naa a2200601 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024001800097040001800115100001800133245008200151300001800233500001500251520091700266650001401183650001601197650002101213650003501234650002301269650001201292650000901304650002401313650001601337650000901353650001101362650002001373650002101393650001101414650001801425650002901443650001001472650005201482650000901534650001101543650001101554650000901565650006501574650001601639650001601655653000901671653002301680700001801703700001801721700001801739773009801757852001301855939003301868945000801901946001301909852000901922655001201931991581916530742620221121014007.0920402e199112  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI920009992DNAL7 a19578222pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDavidsson, L.14aThe effect of individual dietary components on manganese absorption in humans  ap. 1065-1070.  a2019-12-04  aOur knowledge of dietary factors affecting manganese absorption in man is very limited. In this study we used a recently developed radionuclide technique to measure manganese absorption in human adults. Using paired observations, we explored the effects of adding calcium and manganese to human milk on manganese absorption. Furthermore, the effects of adding phytate, phosphate, and ascorbic acid to infant formula as well as iron and magnesium to wheat bread were evaluated. Addition of calcium to human milk resulted in a significant decrease in manganese absorption whereas no significant differences in manganese absorption were observed as a result of the other test meals administered with and without the evaluated dietary component, respectively. Thus, manganese absorption was not significantly affected by most dietary factors evaluated in this study, except for the addition of calcium to human milk. 3amanganese 3aphytic acid 3asodium phosphate 3anutrient-nutrient interactions 3aexperimental diets 3acalcium 3airon 3adietary supplements 3abreast milk 3amilk 3abreads 3ainfant formulas 3adietary minerals 3aadults 3aascorbic acid 2aAbsorptionxdrug effects 2aAdult 2aCalciumxadministration & dosagexpharmacology. 2aDiet 2aFemale 2aHumans 2aMale 2aManganesexadministration & dosagexbloodxpharmacokinetics. 2aMiddle Aged 2aMilk, Human 0adiet 0amineral absorption1 aCederblad, A.1 aLonnerdal, B.1 aSandstrom, B.0 tAmerican journal of clinical nutrition.g1991 Dec., v. 54, no. 6 p.1065-1070x0002-91657nnas  aDNAL FNC  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aFNC  aOther US  aDNAL 7aarticle03508naa a2200649 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003000111040001800141072001700159100001200176245015300188300001600341500001500357520128400372650003001656650002601686650001101712650003601723650002501759650002001784650002901804650002301833650003001856650002201886650003101908650002301939650002101962650004601983650001802029650002302047650002102070650004802091650005202139650003202191650005302223650002102276650003502297650003102332650004002363650004702403650004902450653002302499653003002522700001302552700001302565700001302578773009502591852000902686856008002695930003302775945002502808946001302833655001202846IND4383573720221121013930.0060915e200609  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438357372DNAL7 a169419022pmid7 a10.1094/MPMI-19-09762doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aLan, L.10aGenome-Wide Gene Expression Analysis of Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato DC3000 Reveals Overlapping and Distinct Pathways Regulated by hrpL and hrpRS  ap. 976-987.  a2019-12-04  aPseudomonas syringae pv. tomato DC3000 is a model pathogen infecting tomato and Arabidopsis plants. Genes encoding the type III secretion system and substrate proteins (collectively called TTSS genes) of this bacterium are induced in plants and in minimal medium (MM). The induction of TTSS genes is mediated by HrpL, an alternative sigma factor recognizing the hrp box in the promoter of TTSS genes. The transcription of hrpL is activated by HrpR and HrpS, two homologous DNA-binding proteins encoded by the hrpRS operon. Microarray analysis was conducted to evaluate the DC3000 genes regulated by hrpL and hrpRS in MM. The analysis identified a number of novel hrpL-activated genes with a putative TTSS-independent function. Genes regulated by hrpL were mostly regulated by hrpRS in the same manner, but a large number of genes regulated by hrpRS were hrpL-independent, indicating that hrpL represents one branch of the regulatory pathways downstream of hrpRS. The induction of the TTSS genes was associated with downregulation of the housekeeping genes, indicating that the activation of the TTSS has a cost on the basic cellular activities. The novel genes and pathways identified by the microarray provide new insight into the bacterial functions coordinating with the TTSS. 3aplant pathogenic bacteria 3amicroarray technology 3agenome 3aPseudomonas syringae pv. tomato 3abiochemical pathways 3agene expression 3atranscription (genetics) 3abacterial proteins 3atype III secretion system 3aprotein secretion 3agene expression regulation 3amicrobial genetics 3apromoter regions 2aBacterial Proteinsxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aBase Sequence 2aBlotting, Northern 2aCluster Analysis 2aDNA-Binding Proteinsxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aGene Expression Regulation, Bacterialxgenetics 2aGenome, Bacterialxgenetics 2aOligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysisxmethods 2aOperonxgenetics 2aPseudomonas syringaexgenetics 2aReproducibility of Results 2aSigma Factorxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aSignal Transductionxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aTranscription Factorsxgeneticsxphysiology. 0ahousekeeping genes 0aType III secretion system1 aDeng, X.1 aZhou, J.1 aTang, X.0 tMolecular plant-microbe interactions.g2006 Sept., v. 19, no. 9 p.976-987x0894-02827nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094/MPMI-19-09763Available from publisher's Web site  a20061209b20070102c00000000  aINDd2CTe2006/10/30  aOther US 7aarticle03284naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003000111040001800141072001700159072001700176100001500193245013600208300001400344520155300358650003801911650001901949650001401968650002301982650002302005650001202028650002302040650002702063650002002090650002002110650001802130650002002148650002702168650002302195650001402218650002702232650002402259700001902283700001502302700001602317700001402333700001302347700001602360700001802376700001402394700001602408773011002424852000902534856008002543930003302623945002502656946001302681655001202694IND4378148620221121014002.0060227e200601  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437814862DNAL7 a164049562pmid7 a10.1094/MPMI-19-00802doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aSandal, N.10aGenetics of symbiosis in Lotus japonicus: recombinant inbred lines, comparative genetic maps, and map position of 35 symbiotic loci  ap. 80-91.  aDevelopment of molecular tools for the analysis of the plant genetic contribution to rhizobial and mycorrhizal symbiosis has provided major advances in our understanding of plant-microbe interactions, and several key symbiotic genes have been identified and characterized. In order to increase the efficiency of genetic analysis in the model legume Lotus japonicus, we present here a selection of improved genetic tools. The two genetic linkage maps previously developed from an interspecific cross between L. japonicus Gifu and L. filicaulis, and an intraspecific cross between the two ecotypes L. japonicus Gifu and L. japonicus MG-20, were aligned through a set of anchor markers. Regions of linkage groups, where genetic resolution is obtained preferentially using one or the other parental combination, are highlighted. Additional genetic resolution and stabilized mapping populations were obtained in recombinant inbred lines derived by a single seed descent from the two populations. For faster mapping of new loci, a selection of reliable markers spread over the chromosome arms provides a common framework for more efficient identification of new alleles and new symbiotic loci among uncharacterized mutant lines. Combining resources from the Lotus community, map positions of a large collection of symbiotic loci are provided together with alleles and closely linked molecular markers. Altogether, this establishes a common genetic resource for Lotus spp. A web-based version will enable this resource to be curated and updated regularly. 3aLotus corniculatus var. japonicus 3aplant genetics 3asymbiosis 3alinkage (genetics) 3achromosome mapping 2aAlleles 2aChromosome Mapping 2aGenes, Plantxgenetics 2aGenetic Linkage 2aGenetic Markers 2aGenome, Plant 2aLotusxgenetics 2aMicrosatellite Repeats 2aMutationxgenetics 2aPhenotype 2aRecombination, Genetic 2aSymbiosisxgenetics1 aPetersen, T.R.1 aMurray, J.1 aUmehara, Y.1 aKaras, B.1 aYano, K.1 aKumagai, H.1 aYoshikawa, M.1 aSaito, K.1 aHayashi, M.0 tMolecular plant-microbe interactions.g2006 Jan., v. 19, no. 1 p.80-91wJournal:jnl43555x0894-02827nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094/MPMI-19-00803Available from publisher's Web site  a20080523b20080606c00000000  aINDdRSCe2006/07/17  aOther US 7aarticle03469naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002400110245006400134300001800198500002400216500001500240520202000255650002202275650001702297650000902314650002902323650001002352650002102362650001102383650001602394650001602410650001902426650001502445650002002460650001402480650001602494650002302510650002002533650002202553650001502575650001902590650001802609650003802627650002302665650001602688650001902704653002802723700001602751700001602767700001802783773011702801852000902918655001202927IND4449393220221121013947.0110215s2010    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444939322DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAdhikārī, Tapana.10aPhytoaccumulation of Lead by Selected Wetland Plant Species  ap. 2623-2632.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-05  aSeveral anthropogenic activities lead to the production of substantial amounts of aqueous effluents that contain various toxic trace and heavy metals and which pose potential threats to the wild habitat of wetlands. As a part of the remediation of heavy metals, it is necessary to identify some aquatic hyperaccumulator plants. To this end, a greenhouse study was conducted to investigate the phytotoxicity resulting from lead (Pb) and its accumulation in selected plant species. Lead was added from low to very high levels in a swell-shrink clayey soil (Typic Haplustert). Seven levels of Pb (0, 50, 100 200, 400, 600, and 800 mg kg-1 soil) were applied. Typha angustifolia L. of Typhaceae and Behaya plant (Ipomoea carnea L.) of the Convolvulaceae family were taken as test plants. Lead was added at high and low concentrations to determine whether an increase in concentration would Pb to an increased toxicity to the plants. Recorded weight of the Typha crop was reduced (6%) at 600 mg Pb kg-1 soil, and at greater doses of Pb, the dry-matter yield was inhibited considerably. In the case of Ipomoea, no growth retardation from Pb was observed. Most Pb accumulated in roots and then was transported to shoots. The Typha angustifolia L. and Ipomoea carnea L. plants show promise for the removal of Pb from contaminated wastewater because they can accumulate high concentrations of Pb in roots (1200 and 1500 mg Pb kg-1 respectively) and shoots (275 and 425 mg Pb kg-1 respectively). Lead uptake by both the plants increased with the increasing doses of Pb (50 to 800 mg kg-1 soil). Physiological parameters such as photosynthesis, respiration, chlorophyll content, and different enzyme activities including nitrate reductase (NR), peroxidase (POD), and succinate dehydrogenase (SD) were also studied for the evaluation of these plant species. In Typha plants, at greater doses of Pb, the rate of photosynthesis and chlorophyll content decreased whereas POD and SD activities increased to combat oxidative stress. 3anitrate reductase 3aheavy metals 3alead 3aanthropogenic activities 3aroots 3aoxidative stress 3ashoots 3agreenhouses 3aremediation 3aphotosynthesis 3aperoxidase 3awater pollution 3aeffluents 3aHaplusterts 3agrowth retardation 3aenzyme activity 3ahyperaccumulators 3aclay soils 3aIpomoea carnea 3aphytotoxicity 3asuccinate dehydrogenase (quinone) 3aTypha angustifolia 3achlorophyll 3awetland plants 0asuccinate dehydrogenase1 aKumar, Ajay1 aSingh, M.V.1 aSubba Rao, A.0 tCommunications in soil science and plant analysis.g2010 , v. 41, no. 20-22 p.2623-2632dDekkerx0010-36247nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle04097naa a2200649 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024003000133040001800163100001900181245013500200300001800335500002400353500001500377506007600392520188400468506003702352650003202389650002602421650001702447650001202464650001502476650002202491650002602513650003002539650002802569650002002597650001202617650001502629650001802644650003102662650001802693650002302711650005902734650003002793650003102823650002802854650005302882650003002935650003602965650002703001653001003028700002203038700001803060700002303078700002403101700002103125700001903146773013303165852000903298856008003307856004803387655001203435IND4382624120221207064918.0060806e200608  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438262412DNAL7 a168853052pmid7 aPMC15387522pmcid7 a10.1128/AEM.00343-062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aQuinn, Patrick10acDNA Microarrays as a Tool for Identification of Biomineralization Proteins in the Coccolithophorid Emiliania huxleyi (Haptophyta)  ap. 5512-5526.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aMarine unicellular coccolithophore algae produce species-specific calcite scales otherwise known as coccoliths. While the coccoliths and their elaborate architecture have attracted the attention of investigators from various scientific disciplines, our knowledge of the underpinnings of the process of biomineralization in this alga is still in its infancy. The processes of calcification and coccolithogenesis are highly regulated and likely to be complex, requiring coordinated expression of many genes and pathways. In this study, we have employed cDNA microarrays to investigate changes in gene expression associated with biomineralization in the most abundant coccolithophorid, Emiliania huxleyi. Expression profiling of cultures grown under calcifying and noncalcifying conditions has been carried out using cDNA microarrays corresponding to approximately 2,300 expressed sequence tags. A total of 127 significantly up- or down-regulated transcripts were identified using a P value of 0.01 and a change of >2.0-fold. Real-time reverse transcriptase PCR was used to test the overall validity of the microarray data, as well as the relevance of many of the proteins predicted to be associated with biomineralization, including a novel gamma-class carbonic anhydrase (A. R. Soto, H. Zheng, D. Shoemaker, J. Rodriguez, B. A. Read, and T. M. Wahlund, Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 72:5500-5511, 2006). Differentially regulated genes include those related to cellular metabolism, ion channels, transport proteins, vesicular trafficking, and cell signaling. The putative function of the vast majority of candidate transcripts could not be defined. Nonetheless, the data described herein represent profiles of the transcription changes associated with biomineralization-related pathways in E. huxleyi and have identified novel and potentially useful targets for more detailed analysis.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aRNA-directed DNA polymerase 3acarbonate dehydratase 3aion channels 3acalcite 3ametabolism 3acomplementary DNA 3amicroarray technology 3apolymerase chain reaction 3aexpressed sequence tags 3agene expression 3ainfancy 3aHaptophyta 3acalcification 2aCalcification, Physiologic 2aCulture Media 2aDNA, Complementary 2aEukaryotaxgeneticsxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aGene Expression Profiling 2aGene Expression Regulation 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aOligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysisxmethods 2aPolymerase Chain Reaction 2aProteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aSequence Analysis, DNA 0agenes1 aBowers, Robert M.1 aZhang, Xiaoyu1 aWahlund, Thomas M.1 aFanelli, Michael A.1 aOlszova, Daniela1 aRead, Betsy A.0 tApplied and environmental microbiology.g2006 Aug., v. 72, no. 8 p.5512-5526dAmerican Society for Microbiologyx0099-22407nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1128/AEM.00343-063Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://aem.asm.org/contents-by-date.0.shtml 7aarticle02648naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003800111040001800149100001800167245006500185300001600250500002400266520094200290650002501232650002001257650001901277650002001296650001101316650002401327650001201351650002301363650002001386650002601406650001601432650004701448650001201495650005201507650004301559650004501602650004501647650002201692650005101714650005801765700001601823700001401839700001301853700001801866700001701884700001801901773009001919852000902009856008802018655001202106IND4449416320221121014242.0110219s2010    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444941632DNAL7 a209248412pmid7 a10.1080/00071668.2010.5069082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWallace, R.J.10aDietary plant bioactives for poultry health and productivity  ap. 461-487.  aIncludes references  a1. Plants and their biologically active chemical constituents, sometimes called secondary metabolites or bioactives, present numerous opportunities for the improvement of livestock production by inclusion in the diet. 2. Many such plant derived materials have well established therapeutic values in man; however, their potential as feed additives in animal production, particularly of poultry, remains largely unexploited. 3. There is increasing evidence indicating that they can be efficient in controlling diseases, and plant bioactives may also influence production parameters such as feed efficiency and product quality. 4. It has been reported that they may even replicate some of the effects of antibiotic growth promoters, which were banned from use in Europe from 2006. 5. This review assesses the status of plant bioactives in poultry production and their mode of action on avian physiology, particularly in the digestive tract. 3achemical composition 3adigestive tract 3afeed additives 3afeed conversion 3ahumans 3amechanism of action 3apoultry 3apoultry production 3aproduct quality 3asecondary metabolites 2aAnimal Feed 2aAnimal Nutritional Physiological Phenomena 2aAnimals 2aAnti-Infective Agentsxchemistryxpharmacology. 2aAntioxidantsxchemistryxpharmacology. 2aFood Additivesxchemistryxpharmacology. 2aPlant Extractsxchemistryxpharmacology. 2aPlantsxchemistry 2aPoultryximmunologyxmicrobiologyxphysiology. 2aPoultry Diseasesxepidemiologyxprevention & control.1 aOleszek, W.1 aFranz, C.1 aHahn, I.1 aBaser, K.H.C.1 aMáthé, Á.1 aTeichmann, K.0 tBritish poultry science.g2010 Aug., v. 51, no. 4 p.461-487dLongmanx0007-16687nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00071668.2010.5069083Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02665naa a2200637 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001400128245010800142300001600250500001500266520073000281650001501011650001801026650001901044650002001063650003301083650000901116650000901125650001401134650002801148650001601176650001401192650004601206650001201252650002301264650002901287650003201316650003101348650003701379650003401416650000901450650005001459650004701509650003301556650000901589650002601598650005201624650003201676653002901708653002501737700001501762700001501777700001201792700001301804700001701817773011301834852000901947930003301956945001301989946001302002655001202015IND2035412020221121013927.0931018e19930630flu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND203541202DNAL7 a76867562pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKamei, Y.10aVitamin D receptor gene expression is UP-regulated by 1, 25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes  ap. 948-955.  a2019-12-04  aVitamin D3, especially 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25 (OH)2 D3), has been shown to inhibit the differentiation of preadipose cells. In the present study, the expression of vitamin D receptor (VDR) was examined by Northern blot analysis in rat adipose tissue and mouse 3T3-L1 adipose cells. The adipose tissue and 3T3-L1 cells expressed mRNA for VDR. Treatment of 3T3-L1 cells with 1 micromolar 1,25 (OH)2 D3 led to a 4-5 fold increase in the VDR mRNA level. VDR mRNA expression was rapidly (within 4 hr) induced by physiological concentrations of 1,25 (OH)2 D3 in a dose-dependent manner. The induction of VDR expression did not require de novo protein synthesis but was completely abolished by an inhibitor of RNA synthesis. 3aadipocytes 3amessenger RNA 3aadipose tissue 3agene expression 3aprotein synthesis inhibitors 3amice 3arats 3areceptors 3ahydroxycholecalciferols 3ametabolites 2a3T3 Cells 2aAdipose Tissuexdrug effectsxmetabolism. 2aAnimals 2aBlotting, Northern 2aCalcitriolxpharmacology 2aCycloheximidexpharmacology 2aDactinomycinxpharmacology 2aDose-Response Relationship, Drug 2aGene Expressionxdrug effects 2aMice 2aPoly Axisolation & purificationxmetabolism. 2aRNAxisolation & purificationxmetabolism. 2aRNA, Messengerxbiosynthesis 2aRats 2aReceptors, Calcitriol 2aReceptors, Steroidxbiosynthesisxdrug effects. 2aUp-Regulationxdrug effects 0arna synthesis inhibitors 0ametabolic inhibitors1 aKawada, T.1 aKazuki, R.1 aOno, T.1 aKato, S.1 aSugimoto, E.0 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g1993 June 30, v. 193, no. 3 p.948-955x0006-291X7nnas  aDNAL  a19931104b19931109c00000000  aINDdGHK  aOther US 7aarticle03162naa a2200757 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001400128245011700142300001600259520097800275650002401253650000801277650002201285650001601307650002101323650002501344650001201369650001301381650001001394650001001404650002201414650002101436650001501457650001501472650001301487650001601500650001401516650003001530650001701560650001301577650002201590650003601612650002401648650003601672650001801708650002301726650002101749650003101770650002001801650003101821650002001852650002801872650002101900650005801921650002401979650002202003650002702025653001902052653002802071653001302099653002402112700001402136700001402150700001302164700001302177773013602190852000902326930003302335945001302368946001102381655001202392IND2195984920221121013923.0981215e19980501ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND219598492DNAL7 a95956812pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKim, Y.O.10aCloning of the thermostable phytase gene (phy) from Bacillus sp.

The gene encoding phytase from Bacillus sp. DS11 was cloned in Escherichia coli and its sequence determined. A 560-bp DNA fragment was used as a probe to screen the genomic library. It was obtained through PCR of Bacillus sp. DS11 chromosomal DNA and two oligonucleotide primers based on N-terminal amino acid sequences of the purified protein and the cyanogen bromide-cleaved 21-kDa fragment. The phy cloned was encoded by a 2.2-kb fragment. This gene comprises 1152 nucleotides and encodes a polypeptide of 383 amino adds with a deduced molecular mass of 41808 Da. Phytase was produced to 20% content of total soluble proteins in E. coli BL21 (DE3) using the pET22b(+) vector with the inducible T7 promoter.

Little is known, however, about the host cell proteins affecting the entry process which involves triggering the host cell signal transduction mechanism. We report here that entry of L. monocytogenes strains (serotypes 4b and 1/2a) into Caco-2 cells induced tyrosine phosphorylation of several host cell proteins including pp60(c-src) substrates. Using specific synthetic peptide substrates, we showed that L. monocytogenes activates, as early as 5 min after bacteria-cell contact, the pp60(c-src) family-related (srcFR) proteins by an inlAB-dependent pathway. The activation of srcFR proteins seems to be crucial in the entry of L. monocytogenes into Caco-2 cells. Indeed, specific inhibition of the srcFR signal by herbimycin A blocked the entry of L. monocytogenes strains. Taken together, our data show that L. monocytogenes enhances cell tyrosine phosphorylations and activates the pp60(c-src) family-related proteins by an inlAB-dependent pathway. 3aListeria monocytogenes 3ahuman cell lines 3aphosphorylation 3aprotein-tyrosine kinases 3aproteins 3aserotypes 3asignal transduction 3asynthetic peptides 3atyrosine 2aBacterial Proteinsxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aBenzoquinones 2aCaco-2 Cellsxenzymologyxmicrobiology. 2aEnzyme Activation 2aEnzyme Inhibitorsxpharmacology 2aHumans 2aLactams, Macrocyclic 2aListeria monocytogenesxpathogenicity 2aMembrane Proteinsxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aMutation 2aPeptidesxmetabolism 2aPhosphorylation 2aProtein-Tyrosine Kinasesxantagonists & inhibitorsxmetabolism. 2aProto-Oncogene Proteins pp60(c-src)xmetabolism 2aQuinonesxpharmacology 2aRifabutinxanalogs & derivatives 2aSignal Transductionxphysiology1 aVelge, P.1 aBottreau, E.0 tFEMS microbiology letters.g1998 May 1, v. 162, no. 1 p.169-176aFederation of European Microbiological Societies.x0378-10977nnas  aDNAL  a19990131b19990208c00000000  aINDdGK1  aNon-US 7aarticle02392naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245008900126300001600215500001500231520120300246650001701449650002101466650002201487650002501509650003001534650001701564650001501581650002001596650001501616650001001631650002201641650001901663650002001682650002601702651001501728653003301743700001601776700001701792773006901809852000901878930003301887945001301920946001301933655001201946IND2035411420221120235815.0931018e199302  vau|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND203541142DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHartz, T.K.10aSolarization is an effective soil disinfestation technique for strawberry production  ap. 104-106.  a2019-12-04  aSoil solarization, alone and combined with metam sodium (MS), was evaluated as an alternative to methyl bromide and chloropicrin (MBC) fumigation, the standard soil disinfestation technique in the California strawberry (Fragaria X ananassa Duch.) industry. Tests were conducted in two consecutive annual production cycles in Irvine, Calif., an environment representative of the coastal strawberry production area. Solarization treatments were applied from late July through September for October plantings. Treatments were equally effective in reducing baited populations of phytophthora cactorum [(Lebert and Cohn) J. Schrot] (1989-90) and P. citricola Sawada (1990-91) when compared to pathogen survival in nontreated soil. Solarization and MBC reduced Verticillium dahliae Kleb inoculum in 1989-90, but MBC gave superior control in 1990-91. Solarization significantly controlled annual weeds, but was less effective than MBC. In 1989-90, solarization alone increased strawberry yield 12% over the yield of nontreated plots; when combined with MS, yield increase was 29%, equivalent to that achieved with MBC fumigation. Treatments were equally effective in increasing yields in the 1990-91 test. 3aweed control 3asoil temperature 3aFragaria ananassa 3aVerticillium dahliae 3afungal diseases of plants 3achloropicrin 3asoil depth 3adisease control 3acrop yield 3ametam 3asoil solarization 3amethyl bromide 3asoil fumigation 3aPhytophthora cactorum 3aCalifornia 0aplant diseases and disorders1 aDeVay, J.E.1 aElmore, C.L.0 tHortScience.g1993 Feb., v. 28, no. 2 p.104-106x0018-53457nnas  aDNAL  a19931104b19931109c00000000  aINDdLJS  aOther US 7aarticle02403naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100002200128245014300150300001600293520076700309650002701076650002301103650002001126650000901146650002701155650002201182650002501204650002401229650001801253650002301271650002601294650003301320650003001353650004001383650002001423650003701443650002801480650002701508650003901535653002101574653002101595653002801616700001901644700001801663773013801681852000901819930003301828945001301861946001101874655001201885IND2196286620221120235719.0990105e19980615ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND219628662DNAL7 a96730292pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDobrowolski, M.P.10aMicrosatellites in the mitochondrial genome of Phytophthora cinnamomi failed to provide highly polymorphic markers for population genetics  ap. 243-248.  aMicrosatellites were evaluated as genetic markers for the mitochondrial genome (mtDNA) of Phytophthora cinnamomi for population studies.

Because present calculations included the effect of the variation of all indices, the new requirements for iron were increased to 2.84 mg/d in adult women and 3.21 mg/d in teen-agers (95th percentiles). Six independent estimations of whole-diet iron bioavailability were made to translate absorbed iron requirements into dietary requirements. In subjects with no iron stores, estimated dietary iron bioavailability amounted to 14% (Swedish diet), 16% (French diet), and 16.6% (US diet).

As compared with the 11 available genomes of free-living relatives, only 186 open reading frames were found to be unique to the epibiont genome. 2-D differential gel electrophoresis (2-D DIGE) of the soluble proteomes recovered 1612 protein spots of which 54 were detected exclusively in consortia but not in pure epibiont cultures. Using mass spectrometry analyses, the 13 most intense of the 54 spots could be attributed to the epibiont. Analyses of the membrane proteins of consortia, of consortia treated with cross-linkers and of pure cultures indicated that a branched chain amino acid ABC-transporter binding protein is only expressed in the symbiotic state of the epibiont. Furthermore, analyses of chlorosomes revealed that an uncharacterized 11 kDa epibiont protein is only expressed during symbiosis. This protein may be involved in the intracellular sorting of chlorosomes. Application of a novel prokaryotic cDNA suppression subtractive hybridization technique led to identification of 14 differentially regulated genes, and comparison of the transcriptomes of symbiotic and free-living epibionts indicated that 328 genes were differentially transcribed. The three approaches were mostly complementary and thereby yielded a first inventory of 352 genes that are likely to be involved in the bacterial interaction in 'C. aggregatum'. Notably, most of the regulated genes encoded components of central metabolic pathways whereas only very few (7.5%) of the unique 'symbiosis genes' turned out to be regulated under the experimental conditions tested. This pronounced regulation of central metabolic pathways may serve to fine-tune the symbiotic interaction in 'C. aggregatum' in response to environmental conditions. 3abacteria 3abinding proteins 3abiochemical pathways 3abranched chain amino acids 3acomplementary DNA 3aenvironmental factors 3agel electrophoresis 3agenes 3ahybridization 3ainventories 3amass spectrometry 3amembrane proteins 3aopen reading frames 3asulfur 3asymbiosis 2aChlorobixgeneticsxphysiology. 2aDNA, Bacterialxgenetics 2aGene Expression Regulation, Bacterial 2aGenes, Bacterial 2aGenome, Bacterial 2aMicrobial Consortiaxgenetics 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aOpen Reading Frames 2aProteome 2aSequence Analysis, DNA 2aSymbiosisxgenetics 2aTranscriptome1 aHütz, Katharina1 aDibbern, Dörte1 aLi, Tao1 aReisinger, Veronika1 aPlöscher, Matthias1 aEichacker, Lutz1 aEddie, Brian1 aHanson, Thomas1 aBryant, Donald A.1 aOvermann, Jörg0 tEnvironmental microbiology.g2010 Aug., v. 12, no. 8 p.2259-2276dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx1462-29127nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1462-2920.2010.02206.x 7aarticle02862naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001500110245009900125300001800224500002400242520184300266650001202109650002302121650002602144650002302170650001402193650001302207650002002220650002402240650002702264700001502291700001302306700002002319700002002339700001502359773011702374852000902491655001202500IND4449393920221120214228.0110215s2010    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444939392DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Meng10aEcophysiological Differentiation of Two Mosla Species in Response to Nitrogen and Water Levels  ap. 2699-2712.  aIncludes references  aTerrestrial ecosystems are experiencing increased inputs of nitrogen (N) and temporal fluctuations in precipitation, causing flooding or drought, and this could strongly affect the fate of terrestrial plant species, as they might have different abilities to adapt to the changing environment. We grew Mosla dianthera (a widespread species) and M. hangchowensis (an endangered species) under three water treatments (drought, sufficient water, and waterlogging) in combination with three levels of N supply (low, intermediate, and sufficient N) to study the ecophysiological responses of the congeneric species to those simulated environmental changes. The two species showed different responses to waterlogging and drought treatments, particularly when there was abundant N supply in the system. For example, under sufficient N but drought or waterlogging conditions, M. dianthera increased root mass ratio (RMR) and decreased leaf mass ratio (LMR), total leaf area (LA), and leaf area ratio (LAR); such changes can enhance water acquisition and reduce water loss under both drought and waterlogging conditions, in contrast to the general lack of change in those parameters with M. hangchowensis. These differentiations in traits suggest that increased N availability might worsen drought and waterlogging injury to M. hangchowensis and thus accelerate the decline of this population. However, M. dianthera maybe better adapted to high N availability and both drought and waterlogging conditions. We hypothesize that the different adaptive abilities to high N availability and drought and waterlogging conditions are partly responsible for the ecological differentiation observed between these two species in the field and may determine their fate in their native habitat. Further research should test this hypothesis in field experiments. 3adrought 3aendangered species 3afield experimentation 3aflooded conditions 3aleaf area 3anitrogen 3aplants (botany) 3apopulation dynamics 3aterrestrial ecosystems1 aChang, Jie1 aGe, Ying1 aChang, Scott X.1 aHuang, Chengcai1 aWang, Siyu0 tCommunications in soil science and plant analysis.g2010 , v. 41, no. 20-22 p.2699-2712dDekkerx0010-36247nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle02613naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002300110245010600133300001800239500002400257500001500281520152600296650001901822650001901841650001801860650000901878650001201887650000901899650001101908650001401919650002201933650001101955650002001966650001501986651001002001653001702011700001702028700001302045700001902058773011702077852000902194655001202203IND4449393820221120214346.0110215s2010    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444939382DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKaura, Guraprīta.10aZinc adsorption as Affected by Supporting Electrolyte in Benchmark Soils of Punjab in Northwest India  ap. 2685-2698.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-05  aSurface zinc (Zn) adsorption is an important process that regulates the Zn concentration in the solution. The adsorption mechanism along with interacting cations and anions controls the concentration of Zn in the soil solution, which is immediately available to the plant roots. Therefore, the effect of supporting electrolytes on Zn adsorption was studied for eight benchmark soils of Punjab in northwest India. The investigation was undertaken in the presence of 0.01 M sodium sulfate (Na2SO4), 0.03 M sodium chloride (NaCl), 0.03 M sodium nitrate (NaNO3), and 0.01 M potassium sulfate (K2SO4) to study the effect of sulfate (SO42-), chloride (Cl-), nitrate (NO3-), sodium (Na+), and potassium (K+). The greatest amount of Zn adsorbed in the presence of different anions was in the arid series (Gahri Bhagi, Jassipauwali) followed by the semi-arid series (Fatehpur, Kanjli) and subhumid series (Dhar, Chamror). The extent of adsorption in the presence of various anions in most of the soils followed the order as SO42- > Cl-> NO3- and in case of cations as Na+ > K+. The data pertaining to adsorption of Zn conformed to Freundlich and Langmuir adsorption equations both for the anions and cations. The averaged values of the distribution coefficient (K(d)) and partial molar free energy change (mean delta G) were greater in the presence of SO42- followed by Cl- and NO3-, and these values were more in the presence of Na+ as compared to K+. The bonding energy constant and Freundlich constant (K) were also determined. 3asodium nitrate 3asodium sulfate 3asoil solution 3azinc 3acations 3asoil 3aanions 3apotassium 3apotassium sulfate 3asodium 3asodium chloride 3aadsorption 3aIndia 0aelectrolytes1 aSharma, B.D.1 aSeth, A.1 aBhardwaj, S.S.0 tCommunications in soil science and plant analysis.g2010 , v. 41, no. 20-22 p.2685-2698dDekkerx0010-36247nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle02063naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002400110245007100134300001800205500002400223520101400247650001501261650002201276650001301298650001301311650001501324650001401339650002301353650002301376650001901399650001201418650001801430700002401448700001801472700001801490700002301508700002001531773011701551852000901668655001201677IND4449394220221120214223.0110215s2010    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444939422DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKariuki, Solomon K.10aTemporal Variability of Soil Property Dynamics in a Grazed Pasture  ap. 2744-2754.  aIncludes references  aThe seasonal change in soil nutrients influences when producers can accurately sample fields for fertilization and compliance with environmental regulations. The objective of this study was to determine temporal variability of soil tests in a grazed pasture system. Soil samples were collected monthly from two different pastures analyzed for soil pH, plant-available nitrogen (NO3-N), phosphorus (P), and potassium (K). Temporal variability did not exist for Mehlich 3 P and K during the study, but significant temporal variability was observed for the mobile nutrient NO3-N during the study. Similarly, significant temporal variability was found for soil pH during the study, but the differences were rather small and probably would not affect management decisions. The results of our study indicate sampling time had no significant effect on plant-available P and K and a small but significant effect on soil pH, but this is very important for NO3-N assessment when correct sampling protocols are followed. 3acompliance 3aenvironmental law 3anitrogen 3apastures 3aphosphorus 3apotassium 3aseasonal variation 3asoil heterogeneity 3asoil nutrients 3asoil pH 3asoil sampling1 aSchroder, Jackie L.1 aZhang, Hailin1 aHanks, Travis1 aMcGrath, Joshua M.1 aPayton, Mark E.0 tCommunications in soil science and plant analysis.g2010 , v. 41, no. 20-22 p.2744-2754dDekkerx0010-36247nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle04516naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001900110245012200129300001800251500002400269520315700293650001603450650001603466650001903482650001903501650002103520650001403541650002103555650002803576650002603604650001603630650001503646650002703661650001703688650001803705650003503723650001803758650001803776650002303794650001003817700002003827700001903847700002803866700002603894773011703920852000904037655001204046IND4449394320221120214236.0110215s2010    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444939432DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHussain, Amjad10aAssessment of Phosphorus Requirements of Wheat on Different Textured Alluvial Soils through Freundlich Type Equations  ap. 2413-2431.  aIncludes references  aOnce soil solution phosphorus (P) level optimum for plant growth is identified, P adsorption isotherms or their equations can further be used to estimate fertilizer P rates required to adjust this desired soil solution P level to obtain maximum yield. Surface soil samples were collected from a farmer's field area and research area. An adsorption study was conducted on Ustic Endoaquerts (S1 soil), Typic Calciargids (S2 soil), and Typic Torripsamments (S3 soil) to develop the Freundlich-type equations. Phosphorus adsorption data were obtained by equilibrating 10-g soil samples in 100 mL of 0.01 M calcium chloride (CaCl2) containing various amounts of monopotassium phosphate (KH2PO4). Values of 1/n (slope) ranged from 0.4827 to 0.6452 L kg-1. Based on 1/n values, it was inferred that each of the two S1 and S3 soils was homogeneous and S2 was not. The KF (mg P kg-1) values of S1, S2, and S3 soils were 92.45, 55.81, and 23.38, respectively. The highest amount of P (92.45 mg kg-1) was adsorbed at unit EPC in S1 soil, whereas the lowest amount (23.38 mg P kg-1) was adsorbed in S3 soil. Thereafter, 11 P fertilizer doses were calculated by these Freundlich-type equations to adjust different estimated soil solution P levels that were designated as treatments (0.05 to 0.90 mg L-1). Then field experiments on wheat (cv. Inqalab-91) were conducted according to a randomized complete block design (RCBD) on these soils to determine internal (plant tissue), external (soil solution), and fertilizer P requirements. Maximum wheat gain yield (Mg ha-1) was 6.82 with T5 (0.25 mg P L-1) on S1 soil, 5.96 with T5 (0.25 mg P L-1) on S2 soil, and 4.97 with T7 (0.40 mg P L-1) on S3 soil that was obtained by application of 196 kg P2O5 ha-1 on S1 soil, 142 kg P2O5 ha-1 on S2 soil, and 78 kg P2O5 ha-1 on S3 soil. Internal P concentration (%) associated with 95% of maximum wheat yield at booting stage was 0.32 in S1, 0.21 in S2, and 0.33 in S3 soil. In straw, it was 0.123% in S1, 0.080% in S2, and 0.108% in S3 soil. The internal P requirement of wheat grain was 0.39% in S1, 0.40% in S2, and 0.37% in S3 soil. External soil solution P requirement (ESPR) for 95% of maximum yield of wheat was 0.45 mg L-1 in S1 soil, 0.34 mg L-1 in S2 soil, and 0.44 mg L-1 in S3 soil. Quantity of P2O5 corresponding to ESPR values were 217 kg ha-1 on S1, 123 kg ha-1 on S2, and 60 kg ha-1 on S3 soil. Putting ESPR values in the respective Freundlich-type equation, P fertilizer rates (kg P2O5 ha-1) were estimated that were 282 on S1, 167 on S2, and 83 on S3 soil; Practically, 262, 156, and 78 kg P2O5 ha-1 was applied in the field to adjust soil solution P level (mg L-1) at 0.40 (T7), 0.30 (T6), and 0.40 (T7) in S1, S2, and S3 soil, respectively, that are somewhat less than determined ESPR values. Phosphorous doses applied to achieve a desired EPAS value or estimated from graphs against predicted ESPR values, or calculated from corresponding Freundlich-type equations using desired ESPR values are in close proximity to one another. Therefore, any of the techniques can be used interchangeably to estimate the P fertilizer requirement for optimum wheat yield. 3aCalciargids 3aEndoaquerts 3aTorripsamments 3aalluvial soils 3acalcium chloride 3aequations 3afertilizer rates 3afertilizer requirements 3afield experimentation 3agrain yield 3aphosphorus 3aphosphorus fertilizers 3aplant growth 3aplant tissues 3apotassium dihydrogen phosphate 3asoil sampling 3asoil solution 3asorption isotherms 3awheat1 aMurtaza, Ghulam1 aGhafoor, Abdul1 aMehdi, Shahzada Munawar1 aṢābir, Muḥammad.0 tCommunications in soil science and plant analysis.g2010 , v. 41, no. 20-22 p.2413-2431dDekkerx0010-36247nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle03079naa a2200781 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024001800097040001800115100001500133245018000148300001800328500001500346520095800361650002001319650002301339650002301362650001601385650002201401650002901423650001301452650001401465650002301479650001301502650001101515650001701526650001301543650001601556650002001572650001401592650002001606650001501626650001001641650003101651650001601682650001601698650001001714650002101724650003001745650002101775650001101796650002101807650001101828650001101839650004501850650000901895650002301904650002301927650001301950651001001963651001001973653002301983653001102006653001302017700001502030700001502045700001802060700001802078700001502096773009802111852001302209939003302222945000802255946001302263852000902276655001202285991581913910742620221120214311.0920402e199112  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI920010042DNAL7 a18355632pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSuzuki, M.10aNutritional status and daily physical activity of handicapped students in Tokyo metropolitan schools for deaf, blind, mentally retarded, and physically handicapped individuals  ap. 1101-1111.  a2019-12-04  aHeights, weights, and skinfold thicknesses of 2222 handicapped students aged 3-22 y were measured in the 1984 nutritional survey for handicapped students in Tokyo metropolitan schools for deaf, blind, mentally retarded, and physically handicapped individuals.

There were considerable differences in the mean pedometer scores among the four groups of students: deaf > blind = mentally retarded > physically handicapped. In the female students who could walk normally, pedometer scores were negatively related with both body mass index and percent body fat. The nutritional status in the handicapped students is discussed in relation to daily physical activity. 3abody mass index 3askinfold thickness 3anutritional status 3abody weight 3aphysical activity 3apeople with disabilities 3aappetite 3ablindness 3agender differences 3adeafness 3aheight 3ayoung adults 3achildren 3aadolescents 3adietary surveys 3aingestion 2aActivity Cycles 2aAdolescent 2aAdult 2aBlindnessxphysiopathology 2aBody Height 2aBody Weight 2aChild 2aChild, Preschool 2aDeafnessxphysiopathology 2aDisabled Persons 2aEating 2aFeeding Behavior 2aFemale 2aHumans 2aIntellectual Disabilityxphysiopathology 2aMale 2aNutritional Status 2aSkinfold Thickness 2aStudents 3aJapan 0aTokyo 0amental retardation 0agrowth 0abody fat1 aSaitoh, S.1 aTasaki, Y.1 aShimomura, Y.1 aMakishima, R.1 aHosoya, N.0 tAmerican journal of clinical nutrition.g1991 Dec., v. 54, no. 6 p.1101-1111x0002-91657nnas  aDNAL FNC  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aFNC  aOther US  aDNAL 7aarticle02805naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001700153245009900170300001400269500001900283500020300302520145300505650003301958650002001991650001402011650001602025650001202041650001702053650001702070650001102087651001702098700001902115700001802134700001702152773014302169856005402312856004402366852000902410655001202419IND60730334120221120214333.0210309e20200320xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073033412DNAL7 a10.17660/ActaHortic.2020.1271.32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aThipe, E.

In this study, two polyethylene covered tunnels having open-ended naturally-ventilation system (NVT) and a fan-pad evaporative cooling system (FPCT) were compared in terms of inside microclimatic conditions. Temperature and RH were monitored from the 6th May 2013 to the 23rd June 2013. Two butter-head lettuce cultivars, ‘Ballerina’ and ‘Nadine’ were used to determine the effects of two microclimates on crop growth, yield and quality. The results indicated that daytime temperature inside the tunnels was between 4 and 10°C higher than outside. The air temperature in the NVT was between 4 and 6°C higher than in the FPCT. RH was extremely low in the NVT, but was within the crop optima for most crops, including lettuce in the FPCT. The high temperatures in the NVT did not negatively influence the growth of the lettuce. The growth of the cultivar ‘Ballerina’ was faster than ‘Nadine’ under both microclimates. The yield of ‘Ballerina’ was enhanced by the optimum environmental conditions provided by the FPCT, but the cultivar was more susceptible to leaf tip-burn, which was more prevalent under the FPCT conditions, compared to the NVT conditions. With the right choice of cultivar, the NVT could be used during winter for lettuce production. 3aLactuca sativa var. capitata 3aair temperature 3acultivars 3agreenhouses 3alettuce 3amicroclimate 3apolyethylene 3awinter 3aSouth Africa1 aWorkneh, T.

  1 aReinhold-Hurek, B.13aAn endoglucanase is involved in infection of rice roots by the not-cellulose-metabolizing endophyte Azoarcus sp. strain BH72  ap. 181-188.  aThe nitrogen-fixing endophyte Azoarcus sp. strain BH72 infects roots of Kallar grass and rice inter- and intra-cellularly and can spread systemically into shoots without causing symptoms of plant disease. Although cellulose or its breakdown products do not support growth, this strain expresses an endoglucanase, which might be involved in infection. Sequence analysis of eglA places the secreted 34-kDa protein into the glycosyl hydrolases family 5, with highest relatedness (40% identity) to endoglucanases of the phytopathogenic bacteria Xanthomonas campestris and Ralstonia solanacearum. Transcriptional regulation studied by eglA:: gusA fusion was not significantly affected by cellulose or its breakdown products or by microaerobiosis. Strongest induction (threefold) was obtained in bacteria grown in close vicinity to rice roots. Visible sites of expression were the emergence points of lateral roots and root tips, which are the primary regions of ingress into the root. To study the role in endophytic colonization, eglA was inactivated by transposon mutagenesis. Systemic spreading of the eglA mutant and of a pilAB mutant into the rice shoot could no longer be detected by polymerase chain reaction. Microscopic inspection of infection revealed that the intracellular colonization of root epidermis cells was significantly reduced in the eglA-mutant BHE6 compared with the wild type and partially restored in the complementation mutant BHRE2 expressing eglA. This provides evidence that Azoarcus sp. endoglucanase is an important determinant for successful endophytic colonization of rice roots, suggesting an active bacterial colonization process. 3aAzoarcus 3aendophytes 3anitrogen-fixing bacteria 3abacterial proteins 3acellulases 3asequence analysis 3agene expression regulation 3atranscription (genetics) 3aenzyme activity 3aOryza sativa 3arice 3aseedlings 3anitrogenase 2aAzoarcusxclassificationxcytologyxenzymologyxphysiology. 2aCellulasexgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aCellulosexmetabolism 2aGene Expression Regulation, Bacterial 2aGenome, Bacterial 2aMutationxgenetics 2aNitrogenasexgenetics 2aOryzaxanatomy & histologyxmicrobiology. 2aPlant Rootsxcytologyxmicrobiologyxultrastructure. 2aReverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction 2aSeedlingsxmicrobiology. 2aSequence Analysis, DNA 0aendoglucanase1 aMaes, T.1 aGemmer, S.1 aMontagu, M. van1 aHurek, T.0 tMolecular plant-microbe interactions.g2006 Feb., v. 19, no. 2 p.181-188wJournal:jnl43555x0894-02827nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094/MPMI-19-01813Available from publisher's Web site  a20080523b20080606c00000000  aINDdRSCe2006/07/17  aOther US 7aarticle02124naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001500110245010100125300001600226520109400242650002201336650001401358650002601372650002101398650002201419650001201441650002801453650002001481650002001501650002101521653003101542700001701573700002301590773006901613852000901682930003301691945001301724946001301737655001201750IND2035409320221122054305.0931018e199302  vau|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND203540932DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLamb, M.J.10aPretreatment watermelon nutrition with various nitrate: ammonium ratios and supplemental calcium  ap. 101-103.  aWatermelon [Citrullus lanatus (Thunb.)

Five NO3:NH4 ratios and five levels of supplemental Ca were combined factorially in a 100N-31P-265K mg.liter-1 pretransplant nutrition regime. The medium was amended with CaCO3 in 1989; the medium was not amended in 1990. Dry-matter accumulation had decreased with increasing NH4-N 3 weeks after seeding both years. In 1989, increasing NH4-N also had decreased seedling growth by the last sampling date due to decreased NH4+ uptake. Shoot N concentration was higher in 1990 than 1989, but N uptake was similar. On the first sampling date in both years, increasing the Ca concentration decreased seedling growth and increased medium electrical conductivity (EC). In 1990, increasing the Ca concentration raised shoot N concentration but did not increase seedling growth or N uptake. Either N form at 100 mg N/liter and Ca at 4 to 8 mmol.liter-1 were optimal for watermelon transplant production, but Ca at > 8 mmol.liter-1 suppressed transplant growth. 3aCitrullus lanatus 3acultivars 3apreplanting treatment 3anitrate nitrogen 3aammonium nitrogen 3acalcium 3adry matter accumulation 3aseedling growth 3aplant nutrition 3aapplication rate 0apretransplanting treatment1 aClough, G.H.1 aHemphill, D.D.

The recent release of the whole mtDNA of Hypoderma lineatum and the retrieval of a 102bp noncoding region occurring between tRNASer and NADH dehydrogenase subunit 1 (nd1) genes represented the foundation for this study. The noncoding region and the two flanking mitochondrial genes (i.e., tRNASer and nd1) of the most diffused Hypoderma spp. (i.e., Hypoderma actaeon, Hypoderma bovis, Hypoderma diana, H. lineatum, Hypoderma sinense and Hypoderma tarandi) were analysed. Interspecific variations in amplicon size (from 20 to 102bp in H. tarandi and H. lineatum, respectively) and nucleotide sequences allowed a genetic discrimination of the examined species providing information instrumental to a rapid molecular identification of Hypoderma spp. 3aHypoderma 3amyiasis 3alarvae 3apathogen identification 3amitochondrial DNA 3anucleotide sequences 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aAnimals 2aBase Sequence 2aDNA, Mitochondrialxchemistryxgenetics. 2aDipteraxgenetics 2aLarvaxgenetics 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aNADH Dehydrogenasexchemistryxgenetics. 2aPhylogeny 2aPolymerase Chain Reaction 2aRNA, Transfer, Serxchemistryxgenetics. 2aSequence Alignment 2aSequence Analysis, DNA 0amolecular identification 0amolecular sequence data1 aTraversa, Donato1 aTestini, Gabriella1 aDantas-Torres, Filipe1 aParisi, Antonio1 aColwell, D.

Because of the serious problems associated with resistance to the available acaricides, this product has been used as an important alternative to control acaricide-resistant ticks. The objective of this work was to analyse the fipronil sensitivity of ticks that were collected from farms with a history of fipronil use by larval bioassays. A total of 11 Brazilian tick populations were studied: one population from Rio Grande do Sul, one population from Mato Grosso do Sul and nine populations from São Paulo. To validate the assays, susceptible reference strains, POA (Porto Alegre, Brazil) and Mozo (Dilave, Uruguay), and ticks from six different farms that never used fipronil were tested. The resistance of various tick populations to technical grade fipronil (95.3%) was primarily evaluated using the larvae immersion test (LIT) and the larval packet test (LPT), when a sufficient number of larvae was collected. Using the LIT, the resistance ratios (RR₅₀) of the tick populations from Rio Grande do Sul and Mato Grosso do Sul were 14.9 and 2.6, respectively, and the populations derived from São Paulo had RR₅₀s ranging from 2.5 to 6.9. Four populations were evaluated with the LPT, and two populations displayed lower RR₅₀, while other populations displayed higher RR₅₀ than those determined by the LIT. This article reports the first cases of fipronil resistance in Brazil and highlights the LIT as a more sensitive technique for the evaluation of fipronil resistance in R. (B) microplus ticks. We suggest the use of the LIT as an evaluation tool for monitoring fipronil resistance in the control programmes of R. (B) microplus. 3aRhipicephalus microplus 3acattle 3abioassays 3ain vitro studies 3afipronil 3adrug resistance 2aAnimals 2aBiological Assay 2aCattle 2aCattle Diseasesxdrug therapyxparasitology. 2aInsecticide Resistance 2aInsecticidesxpharmacology 2aLarvaxgrowth & development 2aPyrazolesxpharmacology 2aRhipicephalusxgrowth & development 2aTick Infestationsxdrug therapyxprevention & controlxveterinary. 3aBrazil 0aBoophilus microplus1 aMartins, J.R.1 aMendes, M.C.1 aNamindome, A.1 aKlafke, G.M.1 aSchumaker, T.T.S.0 tVeterinary parasitology.g2010 Oct. 29, v. 173, no. 3-4 p.300-306dElsevierx0304-40177nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vetpar.2010.06.0363Available from publisher's Web site  a20110417b20110507c00000000  aINDd6CTe2011/03/22  aNon-US 7aarticle04100naa a2200745 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024003100133040001800164100002500182245015100207300001800358500002400376500001500400506007600415520158100491506003702072650001802109650001602127650001402143650001002157650001402167650002102181650005202202650001702254650002002271650001002291650001902301650001902320650001202339650001502351650002402366650003102390650001102421650005202432650003102484650003802515650006402553650006902617650002602686650003102712650002702743650005202770650003902822650001402861653002702875700002202902700002502924700001902949700001902968700002302987700002603010700001903036700002303055700002303078700001703101700001903118773011503137852000903252856008103261655001203342IND4428199520221207065402.0091106e200911  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442819952DNAL7 a195870962pmid7 aPMC27730732pmcid7 a10.1104/pp.109.1420342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPucciariello, Chiara10a(Homo)glutathione Depletion Modulates Host Gene Expression during the Symbiotic Interaction between Medicago truncatula and Sinorhizobium meliloti  ap. 1186-1196.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aUnder nitrogen-limiting conditions, legumes interact with symbiotic rhizobia to produce nitrogen-fixing root nodules. We have previously shown that glutathione and homoglutathione [(h)GSH] deficiencies impaired Medicago truncatula symbiosis efficiency, showing the importance of the low Mr thiols during the nodulation process in the model legume M. truncatula. In this study, the plant transcriptomic response to Sinorhizobium meliloti infection under (h)GSH depletion was investigated using cDNA-amplified fragment length polymorphism analysis. Among 6,149 expression tags monitored, 181 genes displayed significant differential expression between inoculated control and inoculated (h)GSH depleted roots. Quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction analysis confirmed the changes in mRNA levels. This transcriptomic analysis shows a down-regulation of genes involved in meristem formation and a modulation of the expression of stress-related genes in (h)GSH-depleted plants. Promoter-β-glucuronidase histochemical analysis showed that the putative MtPIP2 aquaporin might be up-regulated during nodule meristem formation and that this up-regulation is inhibited under (h)GSH depletion. (h)GSH depletion enhances the expression of salicylic acid (SA)-regulated genes after S. meliloti infection and the expression of SA-regulated genes after exogenous SA treatment. Modification of water transport and SA signaling pathway observed under (h)GSH deficiency contribute to explain how (h)GSH depletion alters the proper development of the symbiotic interaction.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3amessenger RNA 3aglutathione 3asymbiosis 3ahosts 3ameristems 3aEnsifer meliloti 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3aroot nodules 3agene expression 3agenes 3aplant response 3asalicylic acid 3alegumes 3anodulation 3aMedicago truncatula 3agene expression regulation 3athiols 2aAmplified Fragment Length Polymorphism Analysis 2aGene Expression Profiling. 2aGene Expression Regulation, Plant 2aGlutathionexanalogs & derivativesxdeficiencyxmetabolism. 2aMedicago truncatulaxgeneticsxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aPlant Root Nodulation 2aRNA, Messengerxmetabolism 2aRNA, Plantxmetabolism 2aReverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction 2aSinorhizobium melilotixphysiology 2aSymbiosis 0aSinorhizobium meliloti1 aInnocenti, Gilles1 aVan de Velde, Willem1 aLambert, Annie1 aHopkins, Julie1 aClément, Mathilde1 aPonchet, M.q(Michel)1 aPauly, Nicolas1 aGoormachtig, Sofie1 aHolsters, Marcelle1 aPuppo, Alain1 aFrendo, Pierre0 tPlant physiology.g2009 Nov., v. 151, no. 3 p.1186-1196dAmerican Society of Plant Biologistsx0032-08897nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1104/pp.109.1420343Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle01929naa a2200505 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024001800097040001800115100001600133245005400149300001600203520063200219650001900851650001900870650001500889650002300904650001800927650002300945650001500968650001200983650001600995650001601011650001901027650001901046650001101065650001801076650002201094650001101116650001501127650001101142650001101153650001601164650000901180653002001189700001601209700001401225773010901239852000901348939003301357945000801390946001301398655001201411991581911760742620221120204827.0920330e199111  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI920009442DNAL7 a17793132pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aButte, N.F.10aHeart rates of breast-fed and formula-fed infants  ap. 391-396.  aHeart rates of 46 breast-fed and formula-fed infants were monitored continuously for approximately 18 h at 1 or 4 months of age.

One characteristic is that they induce epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT), a process that reorganizes epithelial cells to become migratory mesenchymal cells. E-cadherin is a major target gene of these transcriptional repressors, and this downregulation is considered a hallmark of EMT. In recent years, the involvement of the ZEB proteins in pathological contexts has been documented as well. Mutations in ZEB encoding genes cause severe syndromic malformations and evidence is mounting that links these factors to malignant tumor progression. In this review, we describe what is currently known on the molecular pathways these transcription factors are implicated in, and we highlight their roles in development and human diseases, with a focus on tumor malignancy. 3aabnormal development 3acadherins 3aembryogenesis 3aepithelial cells 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3ahuman development 3ahuman diseases 3amigratory behavior 3amutation 3arepressor proteins 3azinc finger motif 2aAnimals 2aDisease Progression 2aEpithelial Cellsxphysiology 2aGene Expression Regulation 2aHomeodomain Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aHumans 2aModels, Biological 2aMorphogenesisxphysiology 2aMutation 2aNeoplasmsxmetabolismxpathology. 2aProtein Isoformsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aSignal Transductionxphysiology 2aSyndrome 2aTranscription Factorsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 0aEMT 0aZEB 0adevelopment 0ainvasion 0atranscription 0amigration1 aVan Roy, F. 1 aBerx, G. 0 tCellular and molecular life sciences.g2009 Mar., v. 66, no. 5 p.773-787dBasel : Birkhäuser-Verlagx1420-682X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00018-008-8465-83Available from publisher's Web site  a20090228b20090301c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03357naa a2200601 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092040001800130072000900148072000900157072000900166100001800175245013500193300001800328500002400346500001500370520159700385650001901982650002402001650001002025650001302035650002602048650001702074650001702091650001302108650002602121650002402147650001602171650001902187650001502206650001102221650002602232650002202258650002402280650001402304650001702318651001202335653001902347653001702366653002502383653001602408653002202424700001902446773011202465852000902577856008802586930003302674945002502707946001102732655001202743IND4443516020221120163021.0101015e20101015xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444351602DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foreco.2010.08.0322doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF821 0aK001 0aF3001 aMan, Rongzhou10aResponse of aspen stands to forest tent caterpillar defoliation and subsequent overstory mortality in northeastern Ontario, Canada  ap. 1853-1860.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aOverstory mortality, understory tree recruitment, and vegetation development were assessed in trembling aspen (Populus tremuloides Michx.) stands following two recent episodes of forest tent caterpillar defoliation (Malacosoma disstria Hbn.) in northeastern Ontario. The results suggest that poplar (aspen and balsam poplar (Populus balsamifera L.)) mortality increased with consecutive years of insect defoliation occurring from the mid-1980s to mid-2000s and the proportion of poplars in the overstory, but decreased with improved pre-defoliation tree vigour (DBH increment). The first outbreak, which lasted from the mid-1980s to early 1990s, was more severe in terms of insect defoliation and contributed more to poplar mortality and decline. The decline began in the late 1990s and peaked in early 2000s. Poplar regeneration and understory shrubs responded rapidly to foliage loss to insect defoliation and mortality of overstory poplars. The regenerated poplars were able to maintain their growth under developing shrubs and residual overstory canopy and numbers were sufficient to compensate for the poplar trees lost to insect infestation. The defoliation-induced overstory decline will accelerate the transition of aspen stands to conifer dominance through enhanced conifer recruitment and growth, and reduced hardwood overstory in aspen-dominated stands, while hardwood dominance will persist in pure aspen stands. From a timber supply perspective, the decline caused by forest tent caterpillar defoliation could delay the availability of aspen stands for harvesting by 40-50 years. 3aboreal forests 3aPopulus balsamifera 3avigor 3aconifers 3astand characteristics 3ainsect pests 3aforest trees 3adiameter 3abotanical composition 3aMalacosoma disstria 3adefoliation 3atree mortality 3aunderstory 3ashrubs 3aecological succession 3aforest management 3aPopulus tremuloides 3aoverstory 3aforest pests 3aOntario 0apest outbreaks 0aplant damage 0avegetation structure 0arecruitment 0astand development1 aRice, James A.0 tForest ecology and management.g2010 Oct. 15, v. 260, no. 10 p.1853-1860dElsevier Sciencex0378-11277nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foreco.2010.08.0323Available from publisher's Web site  a20110112b20110205c00000000  aINDd2CTe2010/12/02  aNon-US 7aarticle02593naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092040001800130072000900148100002400157245009400181300001800275500002400293500001500317520110300332650001301435650001701448650001101465650002401476650001601500650002001516650002801536650002101564650002201585650001301607653001701620653003601637653003901673653001601712653003301728700001701761700002001778700002301798773011201821852000901933856008801942930003302030945002502063946001102088655001202099IND4443516320221120163114.0101015e20101015xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444351632DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foreco.2010.08.0352doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aK2501 aSaborowski, Joachim10aDouble sampling for stratification in periodic inventories—Infinite population approach  ap. 1886-1895.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aDouble sampling for stratification is a sampling design that is widely used for forest and other resource inventories in forest ecosystems. It is shown that this sampling design can be adapted to repeated inventories including estimators of net change, even for non-proportional allocation of second-phase units and periodically updated stratification. The method accounts for the transition of sampling units among strata. Moreover, it may outperform classical single phase designs if sample plots are appropriately allocated to strata with respect to predefined target variables, here: volume per ha of bigger trees of the main tree species. The latter requires a clear definition of predominant aims of the inventory and an appropriate optimization method. Access to inventory data of a state forest district from two occasions allowed for an optimization of the design based on the first occasion, which proved to be still advantageous on the following occasion. Estimators are developed under the infinite population approach, which is generally deemed more appropriate for forest inventories. 3asampling 3aforest trees 3avolume 3aexperimental design 3acalibration 3adata collection 3adry matter accumulation 3aforest inventory 3aforest ecosystems 3aaccuracy 0aoptimization 0aforest inventory stratification 0adouble sampling for stratification 0amethodology 0ainfinite population approach1 aMarx, Almuth1 aNagel, Jürgen.1 aBöckmann, Thomas.0 tForest ecology and management.g2010 Oct. 15, v. 260, no. 10 p.1886-1895dElsevier Sciencex0378-11277nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foreco.2010.08.0353Available from publisher's Web site  a20110112b20110205c00000000  aINDd2CTe2010/12/02  aNon-US 7aarticle03421naa a2200769 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001900164245012200183300001600305520098000321650002901301650001101330650001301341650001201354650001201366650001601378650001301394650001401407650002101421650002201442650001501464650001401479650001501493650002001508650001701528650004001545650002401585650002401609650002301633650002501656650002801681650002401709650002801733650002501761650004601786650002801832650002401860650002301884650002401907650004001931650005201971650008702023650001702110653003602127653002502163653002402188653002302212700002102235700001902256700001702275700002002292700001802312700001702330700001502347700001702362773012202379852000902501856008502510930003302595946001102628655001202639IND4417086120221120162956.0090228e200903  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441708612DNAL7 a192056222pmid7 a10.1007/s00018-009-8574-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMagherini, F. 10aDifferent carbon sources affect lifespan and protein redox state during Saccharomyces cerevisiae chronological ageing  ap. 933-947.  aIn this study, a proteomic approach that combines selective labelling of proteins containing reduced cysteine residues with two-dimensional electrophoresis/mass spectrometry was used to evaluate the redox state of protein cysteines during chronological ageing in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The procedure was developed on the grounds that biotinconjugated iodoacetamide (BIAM) specifically reacts with reduced cysteine residues. BIAM-labelled proteins can then be selectively isolated by streptavidin affinity capture. We compared cells grown on 2% glucose in the exponential phase and during chronological ageing and we found that many proteins undergo cysteine oxidation. The target proteins include enzymes involved in glucose metabolism. Both caloric restriction and growth on glycerol resulted in a decrease in the oxidative modification. Furthermore, in these conditions a reduced production of ROS and a more negative glutathione half cell redox potential were observed. 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3acarbon 3acysteine 3aenzymes 3aglucose 3aglutathione 3aglycerol 3alongevity 3alow calorie diet 3amass spectrometry 3ametabolism 3aoxidation 3aproteomics 3aredox potential 3astreptavidin 3atwo-dimensional gel electrophoresis 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aCaloric Restriction 2aCarbonxmetabolism 2aCysteinexmetabolism 2aCytochromesxmetabolism 2aGlucosexmetabolism 2aGlutathionexmetabolism 2aGlycerolxmetabolism 2aMitochondriaxmetabolismxultrastructure. 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aOxidation-Reduction 2aOxygen Consumption 2aProteomicsxmethods 2aReactive Oxygen Speciesxmetabolism 2aSaccharomyces cerevisiaexcytologyxphysiology. 2aSaccharomyces cerevisiae Proteinsxgeneticsxisolation & purificationxmetabolism. 2aTime Factors 0atwo-dimensional electrophoresis 0achronological ageing 0acaloric restriction 0aproteins oxidation1 aCarpentieri, A. 1 aAmoresano, A. 1 aGamberi, T. 1 aDe Filippo, C. 1 aRizzetto, L. 1 aBiagini, M. 1 aPucci, P. 1 aModesti, A. 0 tCellular and molecular life sciences.g2009 Mar., v. 66, no. 5 p.933-947dBasel : Birkhäuser-Verlagx1420-682X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00018-009-8574-z3Available from publisher's Web site  a20090228b20090301c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03826naa a2200601 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092040001800130072000900148072000900157072000900166100001900175245015400194300001800348500002400366500001500390520204900405650001202454650001802466650002202484650001602506650002902522650001302551650002402564650002002588650001002608650001802618650002402636650001702660650001702677650002402694650002102718650001202739650001402751650002002765650002602785650001402811651001602825653001402841653002202855653001202877700001902889700002602908773011202934852000903046856008803055930003303143945002503176946001103201655001203212IND4443515520221120143116.0101015e20101015xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444351552DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foreco.2010.08.0252doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aM310 0aK001 0aK1001 aReid, David J.10aResponses of stream macroinvertebrate communities to progressive forest harvesting: Influences of harvest intensity, stream size and riparian buffers  ap. 1804-1815.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aHarvesting of forests causes a range of disturbances, including changes to hydrology, nutrient inputs, water quality, food sources, habitat structure and channel morphology, which can impact streams over several years and are reflected in changes in community structure. We aimed to determine the relative magnitudes of impact and rates of recovery of benthic macroinvertebrate communities, and associated changes in biotic indices (Quantitative Macroinvertebrate Community Index and an Index of Biotic Integrity), in reaches of different sized streams within progressively logged catchments. We conducted annual summer surveys over seventeen years in fifteen New Zealand streams that differed in size (upstream catchment area between 40 and 2360ha, mean channel widths between 2.5 and 16m) and harvest intensity in the surrounding catchment. The largest post-harvest changes in biotic indices and community structures occurred in streams draining relatively small to medium catchments (<500ha) where >40% of the upstream catchment had been harvested, and particularly after harvesting of overstorey riparian vegetation adjacent to study reaches. The impacts of harvest on invertebrate communities were less evident in wider streams draining catchments over 500ha, but the largest changes from pre-harvest biotic indices and community structure still generally occurred after harvesting of riparian vegetation along these streams. The changes in community structure after harvesting of riparian vegetation typically included increases in the densities of Diptera, Mollusca and Oligochaetes, and decreases in the densities of Ephemeroptera. These results demonstrate that impacts on benthic macroinvertebrate communities increased as the proportion of upstream catchment harvested increased and/or after riparian vegetation was harvested. Some of the communities in headwater streams had largely recovered towards pre-harvest structures, whereas post-harvest recovery was less evident in relatively large streams, over the duration of the study. 3aDiptera 3aEphemeroptera 3atemperate forests 3aOligochaeta 3aanthropogenic activities 3aMollusca 3aforested watersheds 3aaquatic habitat 3awidth 3awater quality 3acommunity structure 3abenthic zone 3abiodiversity 3aaquatic communities 3ariparian buffers 3alogging 3afood webs 3astream channels 3aaquatic invertebrates 3aoverstory 3aNew Zealand 0ahydrology 0alogging intensity 0astreams1 aQuinn, John M.1 aWright-Stow, Aslan E.0 tForest ecology and management.g2010 Oct. 15, v. 260, no. 10 p.1804-1815dElsevier Sciencex0378-11277nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foreco.2010.08.0253Available from publisher's Web site  a20110112b20110205c00000000  aINDd2CTe2010/12/02  aNon-US 7aarticle02709naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092040001800130072000900148072000900157072000900166072000900175072000900184100001700193245013200210300001800342500002400360500001500384520111700399650002301516650002201539650001701561650001501578650002301593650001701616650002201633650001801655650002501673650002001698650001601718650002701734650000901761650001901770650001701789650002101806651002001827653001701847700001301864773011201877852000901989856008801998930003302086945002502119946001102144655001202155IND4443515320221120143019.0101015e20101015xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444351532DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foreco.2010.08.0232doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aK110 0aK810 0aB200 0aF300 0aX1501 aPenman, T.D.10aClimate and recent fire history affect fuel loads in Eucalyptus forests: Implications for fire management in a changing climate  ap. 1791-1797.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aPredicted changes to global climates are expected to affect natural fire regimes. Many studies suggest that the impact of these effects could be minimised by reducing fuel loads through prescribed burning. Fuel loads are dynamic and are affected by a range of factors including fire and climate. In this study, we use a 22-year dataset to examine the relative influence of climate and fire history on rates of litterfall and decomposition, and hence fuel loads, in a coastal Eucalypt forest in south-eastern Australia. Litterfall and decomposition were both affected by temperature, recent rainfall and fire history variables. Over the study period prescribed burning immediately reduced fuel loads, with fuel loads reaching pre-burn levels within 3 years of a fire. Modelling fuel loads under predicted climate change scenarios for 2070 suggests that while fuel loads are reduced, the levels are not significantly lower than those recorded in the study. Based on these predictions it is unlikely that the role or value of prescribed burning in these forests will change under the scenarios tested in this study. 3atemporal variation 3asimulation models 3aforest trees 3aEucalyptus 3aprescribed burning 3afuel loading 3atemperate forests 3aforest litter 3afuels (fire ecology) 3aair temperature 3afire regime 3aforest fire management 3arain 3abiodegradation 3aforest fires 3aclimatic factors 3aNew South Wales 0afire ecology1 aYork, A.0 tForest ecology and management.g2010 Oct. 15, v. 260, no. 10 p.1791-1797dElsevier Sciencex0378-11277nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foreco.2010.08.0233Available from publisher's Web site  a20110112b20110205c00000000  aINDd2CTe2010/12/02  aNon-US 7aarticle02535naa a2200517 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024001800097040001800115100002200133245009600155300001800251500001500269520106800284650002401352650002301376650002601399650002001425650001201445650001801457650001701475650003801492650003401530650003601564650001601600650001101616650001101627650002001638650003801658650002101696651001301717653001401730653001601744653001501760653002101775700001801796700001701814773009801831852001301929939003301942945000801975946001301983852000901996655001202005991581904900742620221120092045.0920402e199112  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI920009942DNAL7 a19578182pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLloyd-Still, J.D.10aEssential fatty acid status and fluidity of plasma phospholipids in cystic fibrosis infants  ap. 1029-1035.  a2019-12-04  aThe fatty acid (FA) patterns of cord serum phospholipids (PLs) were examined in 4 cystic fibrosis (CF) newborns, 8 non-CF siblings, and 22 normal control subjects. Plasma from 27 newly diagnosed CF infants and 38 normal infants aged < 2 y were studied for comparison. CF cord-blood PLs had patterns similar to those of CF siblings and to normal newborns, but the pattern for CF did not shift toward adult patterns during infancy as did patterns for normal infants. CF infants at diagnosis exhibited a deficiency pattern in which 18: 2 omega 6, 20:4 omega 6, 22:4 omega 6, and omega 3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) were significantly subnormal and 18:3 omega 6, total saturated fatty acids, and total monounsaturated fatty acids were significantly elevated compared with normal infants. In PLs in CF infants, although mean chain length of FAs was low, mean melting point was elevated 2.4 degrees C and double-bond index was low (both P < 0.001), implying a significantly lessened fluidity. Nutritional supplements of both omega 6 and omega 3 PUFAs are cited. 3aphysical properties 3anutritional status 3aessential fatty acids 3acystic fibrosis 3ainfants 3aphospholipids 2aAgingxblood 2aCystic Fibrosisxbloodxgenetics. 2aFatty Acids, Essentialxblood 2aFatty Acids, Unsaturatedxblood 2aFetal Blood 2aHumans 2aInfant 2aInfant, Newborn 2aPhospholipidsxbloodxphysiology. 2aReference Values 3aIllinois 0amembranes 0afatty acids 0acord blood 0afat deficiencies1 aJohnson, S.B.1 aHolman, R.T.0 tAmerican journal of clinical nutrition.g1991 Dec., v. 54, no. 6 p.1029-1035x0002-91657nnas  aDNAL FNC  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aFNC  aOther US  aDNAL 7aarticle04130naa a2200625 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092040001800130072000900148072000900157072000900166100001900175245009500194300001800289500002400307500001500331520231600346650002302662650001902685650002002704650001802724650002002742650001602762650002802778650001402806650001602820650001802836650002302854650002202877650001102899650002602910650002302936650001702959650002202976650002602998650001203024651001203036653001603048653002403064653002703088653002203115653002003137653002003157700001903177700001803196773011203214852000903326856008803335930003303423945002503456946001103481655001203492IND4443514920221120092034.0101015e20101015xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444351492DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foreco.2010.07.0562doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF300 0aK001 0aP0001 aLõhmus, Piret10aLichen communities on treefall mounds depend more on root-plate than stand characteristics  ap. 1754-1761.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aLarge uprooted trees are typical old-forest structures that provide distinct microsites for sessile organisms. While the habitat value of treefall pits for plants is relatively well known, the characteristic exposed root-plates of treefall mounds, which may require different management, have received less attention. The aim of the current study was to explore key factors of lichen incidence and their community characteristics on root-plates. We mapped and described treefall mounds in 24 stands (2ha each) in a balanced design representing mixed stands of two site types (mesotrophic; drained swamp) and two management types (old growth, mature commercial forest) in hemiboreal Estonia. First, the occurrence of any lichens and of a specialized pin lichen, Chaenotheca furfuracea, was recorded on all 1207 mounds found. According to multi-level logistic regression models, their incidence depended on every mound-scale variable tested: there were independent positive effects of root-plate area and treefall age, spruce treefall, and the absence of exposed pit. In contrast, weak stand-scale effects only appeared when their interactions with mound-scale variables were included or some main effects were eliminated. C. furfuracea also occurred more frequently where other inhabited root-plates were nearby, and such dispersal limitation interacted with habitat quality. Secondly, full lichen communities were described in detail on a subsample of 84 root-plates of Norway spruce (Picea abies). Altogether 48 lichen species were recorded, including eight red-listed or nationally rare species. The communities on large fresh root-plates and in mature drained stands had distinct species composition, while communities of older mounds and in old-growth stands converged in species composition. We conclude that lichen incidence on root-plates is mostly determined by colonization probability, and commercial forests can support a diverse lichen biota when large treefall mounds, particularly of P. abies and of >10 years age are provided. However, given some differences of lichen communities in old growth, and because treefall issues conflict with other management objectives in commercial forests, optimised management of treefall areas there should be complemented by their strict protection in reserves. 3aendangered species 3aboreal forests 3aspore dispersal 3amicrohabitats 3aforest habitats 3aChaenotheca 3ainterspecific variation 3adead wood 3aPicea abies 3amature plants 3atemporal variation 3aspecies diversity 3aswamps 3aplant available water 3aold-growth forests 3aroot systems 3aforest management 3astand characteristics 3alichens 3aEstonia 0aroot-plates 0aspecies differences 0aChaenotheca furfuracea 0acommunity ecology 0ahabitat quality 0atreefall mounds1 aTurja, Kristel1 aLõhmus, Asko0 tForest ecology and management.g2010 Oct. 15, v. 260, no. 10 p.1754-1761dElsevier Sciencex0378-11277nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foreco.2010.07.0563Available from publisher's Web site  a20110112b20110205c00000000  aINDd2CTe2010/12/02  aNon-US 7aarticle01484naa a2200493 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024001800097040001800115100001900133245010300152300001600255520020800271650001300479650001300492650001400505650001800519650000800537650001000545650001800555650003000573650001400603650003700617650001800654650001100672650001100683650001900694650001300713650000900726650001600735650001300751653001800764700001500782700001300797700001800810700001600828773007100844852000900915939003300924945000800957946001300965655001200978991581904790742620221120091921.0920401e199201  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI920009592DNAL7 a13106452pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLibrenti, M.C.10aEffect of soya and cellulose fibers on postprandial glycemic response in type II diabetic patients  ap. 111-113.  aWe studied the effect on serum glucose and insulin of a preprandial ingestion of 7 g of soya fibers or of an equal amount of purified cellulose on eight non-insulin-dependent (type II) diabetic patients. 3adiabetes 3asoybeans 3acellulose 3ablood glucose 3amen 3awomen 3adietary fiber 2aBlood Glucosexmetabolism 2aCellulose 2aDiabetes Mellitus, Type 2xblood 2aDietary Fiber 2aFemale 2aHumans 2aInsulinxblood 2aKinetics 2aMale 2aMiddle Aged 2aSoybeans 0ameal patterns1 aCocchi, M.1 aOrsi, E.1 aPozza, Guido.1 aMicossi, P.0 tDiabetes care.g1992 Jan., v. 15, no. 1 p.111-113x0149-59927nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aFNC  aOther US 7aarticle03438naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100001400154245006700168300001600235500016200251520169300413650002502106650001402131650001902145650001102164650001202175650002502187650001302212650000902225650001602234650002302250650001102273650001202284650001202296650001602308650001102324650001802335650001102353650003202364650001802396650002302414650001402437650002202451650001102473650002602484650001902510650001002529650002602539650000902565700001902574773013702593856005502730856004502785961000902830852000902839655001202848IND60675683120221120081342.0191108s2019    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067568312DNAL7 a10.17660/ActaHortic.2019.1247.152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHomer, I.10aUses of nopal biomass as a source of energy and biofertilizers  ap. 109-116.  aPaper presented at the IX International Congress on Cactus Pear and Cochineal: CAM Crops for a Hotter and Drier World held March 26-30, 2017, Coquimbo, Chile  aThe nopal (Opuntia ficus-indica), cultivated by smallholder farmers, is traditionally used for production of fruits, industrial products, forage and “cochinilla”. Cladodes can also be used for a number of other purposes. We evaluated other uses of nopal cladodes. One of the uses is for biogas production from anaerobic bio-digestion. The daily energy need for a rural family of five people can be met from 3.61 m3 day(‑1) biogas. Considering that 10 t ha(‑1) year(‑1) dried cladodes are produced and that 3 kg dried cladodes produce 1 m3 biogas, it is possible to obtain the biogas needed annually by the family from a 0.4-ha cactus plantation. This amount of biogas has an economic value of US$1078, using the price of commercial gas as a reference. Solid materials and liquid biofertilizer that contain nutrients and material can be obtained in biogas systems. One tonne of solid biofertilizer is equivalent to 40 kg urea, 50 kg potassium nitrate and 94 kg triple superphosphate. Assuming an average price of US$0.32 kg(‑1) fertilizer, each tonne of biofertilizer would be worth US$58.80. Also, dried and crushed cladodes can be used for direct burning or in combination with coal. It is also possible to obtain ethanol from the cladodes, but the production technology is more complex. On a larger scale, 8.6 L ethanol could be produced from 100 kg dried cladodes and 24.7 L ethanol from 100 kg dried fruits, for concentrations of ethanol above 98%. Another bioenergy use is the extraction of fatty acids from fruit seed residues and their transformation into biodiesel. Each fruit has between 150 and 300 seeds, and the oil content ranges between 98 and 139 g kg‑1 seed. 3aOpuntia ficus-indica 3abiodiesel 3abiofertilizers 3abiogas 3abiomass 3acacti and succulents 3acladodes 3acoal 3adried fruit 3aeconomic valuation 3aenergy 3aethanol 3afarmers 3afatty acids 3aforage 3afruit growing 3afruits 3agas production (biological) 3alipid content 3aliquid fertilizers 3anutrients 3apotassium nitrate 3aprices 3aproduction technology 3arural families 3aseeds 3atriple superphosphate 3aurea1 aVarnero, M.

This study presents an example of the investigation of peritoneal metastases by FTIR microimaging. Peritoneal malignancies are generally secondary localizations of primary visceral cancers such as ovarian, stomach or colon cancers. By analysing simultaneously both formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded and frozen specimens, we examined malignant and non-malignant (i.e. fibrotic and cicatricial) peritoneal lesions. Paraffin-embedded tissues were analysed without any previous dewaxing. Multivariate statistical approaches, based on the classification of infrared data by hierarchical cluster analysis, allowed the discrimination of these various samples. Microimaging also permits the revelation of the heterogeneity of the tissue: it was possible to localize precisely the cancerous areas, and to distinguish, on the basis of their spectral signatures, the peritumoral neighbouring connective tissue close to the carcinomatous areas from the connective tissue distant from the cancerous areas. These spectral differences could be useful as complementary information to study molecular changes associated with the malignancy. 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aanimal ovaries 3acluster analysis 3acolorectal neoplasms 3aimage analysis 3ametastasis 3aovarian neoplasms 3astomach 0aMicro Fourier transform infrared analysis 0aPeritoneal metastases 0aOptical diagnosis 0aMultivariate statistical treatment1 aPiot, Olivier 1 aDiebold, Marie-Danielle 1 aBouché, Olivier.1 aScaglia, Elodie 1 aManfait, Michel 0 tAnalytical and bioanalytical chemistry.g2009 Mar., v. 393, no. 6-7 p.1619-1627dBerlin/Heidelberg : Springer-Verlagx1618-26427nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00216-009-2630-23Available from publisher's Web site  a20090228b20090301c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02451naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002800111040001800139100001600157245009900173300001800272520133400290650002401624650001701648650001301665650001401678650001201692650002101704650001901725650003601744700001801780700001801798700001501816773008801831852000901919856007801928930003302006945001302039946001302052655001202065IND2035425020221120070911.0931018e199209  nyu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND203542502DNAL7 a242542952pmid7 a10.1007/BF009932372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNitao, J.K.10aMagnolia virginiana neolignan compounds as chemical barriers to swallowtail butterfly host use  ap. 1661-1671.  aThe role of toxins and deterrents in preventing troilus group species (Lepidoptera, Papilionidae) from feeding on magnoliaceous hosts was investigated using bioassay-directed isolation of Magnolia virginiana allelochemicals. A fraction consisting of three neolignan compounds significantly reduced survival of first instar P. palamedes, a troilus group member. Two of these compounds, magnolol and a biphenyl ether, were tested individually and were both toxic to P. palamedes. The larval survival of P. troilus, another troilus group species, was also significantly reduced by magnolol but not by the biphenyl ether. In contrast, P. glaucus, a polyphagous glaucus group species that feeds on magnoliaceous hosts, was not affected by either compound. The effect of these compounds against a polyphagous nonpapilionid was examined using the fall webworm (Hyphantria cunea, Lepidoptera: Arctiidae). The biphenyl ether but not magnolol significantly lowered webworm first-instar survival, demonstrating that polyphagy does not preadapt lepidopterans to feeding on this neolignan. These results demonstrate that although phagostimulants play a role in the specialization of the troilus group on the Lauraceae, the presence of toxins and/or deterrents in nonhosts is also important in determining food plant patterns in these species. 3aMagnolia virginiana 3aantifeedants 3atoxicity 3abioassays 3aPapilio 3aHyphantria cunea 3ainsect control 3achemical constituents of plants1 aJohnson, K.S.1 aScriber, J.M.1 aNair, M.G.0 tJournal of chemical ecology.g1992 Sept., v. 18, no. 9 p.1661-1671x0098-03317nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF009932373Available from publisher's Web site  a19931104b19931109c00000000  aINDdLDP  aOther US 7aarticle04163naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127072000900145072000900154072000900163072000900172100002000181245013800201300001600339500002400355520268300379650001603062650001903078650001003097650001403107650001503121650001403136650002203150650001503172650001903187650002403206650001903230651001003249653002403259700001603283700001603299700001603315700001503331700001803346773011803364852000903482856008503491930003303576945002503609946001103634655001203645IND4446512920221120061100.0101216e201012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444651292DNAL7 a10.1017/S00218596100004322doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aB200 0aF110 0aF200 0aF6001 aDalla Marta, A.10aAnalysis of the relationships between climate variability and grapevine phenology in the Nobile di Montepulciano wine production area  ap. 657-666.  aIncludes references  aClimate represents one of the main inputs necessary for plants to complete their vegetative–productive cycle, having a direct effect on the onset and duration of phenological stages and development of crops. Equally important are its indirect effects, affecting field operations such as the application of fertilizer, pruning and crop protection, finally determining the yield. In the present study, phenological stages of the Sangiovese grapevine for the production of Nobile di Montepulciano wine were analysed and related to historical series of meteorological information (since 1970 in Tuscany, Italy). Weather conditions were described through large-scale meteorological information; in particular geopotential height at the 500 hPa level (500 hPa GPH) and North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) index were considered. All data were provided by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration-Cooperative Institute for Research in Environmental Sciences (NOAA-CIRES) Climate Diagnostics Center, Boulder, Colorado, USA, available from the NOAA-CIRES website (http://www.cdc.noaa.gov/) and processed by the National Center for Environmental Prediction/National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCEP/NCAR) Reanalysis Project. Conventional meteorological data, such as air temperature and cumulated rainfall, from ground weather stations were also used. The effects of meteorological parameters on crop phenology (bud-break, flowering and harvest time) were investigated by means of regression analysis, while teleconnections between phenological data and large-scale meteo-climatological data were analysed through correlation maps created using the interactive plotting and analysis link from the NOAA-CIRES website (http://www.cdc.noaa.gov). All correlations were calculated on a monthly to a multi-monthly basis, and also in relation to the different physiological stages of the crop, from 1970 to 2006. The climate change and variability impact on the crop was investigated by trend analysis of meteorological information and its effect on the onset of grapevine phenological stages. The results demonstrated that large-scale meteorological information has a significant effect on the onset of the phenological stages of grapevine. In particular, winter NAO was negatively correlated with bud-break and flowering dates, while GPH of February–March, March–May and May–September were negatively correlated with bud-break, flowering and harvest dates, respectively. The trend analysis demonstrated that the change and variability of climate, due to global warming, directly affects the development of grapevine leading to an anticipation of all considered phenophases. 3awine grapes 3aVitis vinifera 3avines 3aphenology 3aprovenance 3ared wines 3aplant development 3acrop yield 3awine cultivars 3ameteorological data 3aclimatic zones 3aItaly 0aclimate variability1 aGrifoni, D.1 aMancini, M.1 aStorchi, P.1 aZipoli, G.1 aOrlandini, S.0 tJournal of agricultural science.g2010 Dec., v. 148, no. 6 p.657-666dCambridge University Pressx0021-85967nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S00218596100004323Available from publisher's Web site  a20110331b20110402c00000000  aINDd3CTe2011/01/19  aNon-US 7aarticle03542naa a2200709 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024003100133040001800164100002000182245009200202300001600294500002400310506007600334520125000410506003701660650002501697650002301722650001101745650001801756650001601774650002501790650001201815650001601827650001901843650001701862650006501879650004801944650002001992650001802012650001602030650003502046650004402081650002302125650006502148650004902213700001902262700002102281700001802302700001902320700001602339700002002355700001902375700002202394700002102416700001702437700001702454700001902471700002202490700002702512700001702539700001902556700001802575700002402593773011302617852000902730856008102739655001202820IND4448377220221207073514.0110126e201101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444837722DNAL7 a210305062pmid7 aPMC30757842pmcid7 a10.1104/pp.110.1651262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLucas, Mikaël.10aSHORT-ROOT Regulates Primary, Lateral, and Adventitious Root Development in Arabidopsis  ap. 384-398.  aIncludes references  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aSHORT-ROOT (SHR) is a well-characterized regulator of radial patterning and indeterminacy of the Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) primary root. However, its role during the elaboration of root system architecture remains unclear. We report that the indeterminate wild-type Arabidopsis root system was transformed into a determinate root system in the shr mutant when growing in soil or agar. The root growth behavior of the shr mutant results from its primary root apical meristem failing to initiate cell division following germination. The inability of shr to reactivate mitotic activity in the root apical meristem is associated with the progressive reduction in the abundance of auxin efflux carriers, PIN-FORMED1 (PIN1), PIN2, PIN3, PIN4, and PIN7. The loss of primary root growth in shr is compensated by the activation of anchor root primordia, whose tissues are radially patterned like the wild type. However, SHR function is not restricted to the primary root but is also required for the initiation and patterning of lateral root primordia. In addition, SHR is necessary to maintain the indeterminate growth of lateral and anchor roots. We conclude that SHR regulates a wide array of Arabidopsis root-related developmental processes.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3aadventitious roots 3aauxins 3acell division 3agermination 3aindeterminate growth 3amutants 3aroot growth 3aroot primordia 3aroot systems 2aArabidopsisxcytologyxgrowth & developmentxultrastructure. 2aArabidopsis Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aBody Patterning 2aCell Division 2aGermination 2aIndoleacetic Acidsxmetabolism 2aMembrane Transport Proteinsxmetabolism 2aMutationxgenetics 2aPlant Rootsxcytologyxgrowth & developmentxultrastructure. 2aTranscription Factorsxgeneticsxmetabolism.1 aSwarup, Ranjan1 aPaponov, Ivan A.1 aSwarup, Kamal1 aCasimiro, Ilda1 aLake, David1 aPeret, Benjamin1 aZappala, Susan1 aMairhofer, Stefan1 aWhitworth, Morag1 aWang, Jiehua1 aLjung, Karin1 aMarchant, Alan1 aSandberg, Göran.1 aHoldsworth, Michael J.1 aPalme, Klaus1 aPridmore, Tony1 aMooney, Sacha1 aBennett, Malcolm J.0 tPlant physiology.g2011 Jan., v. 155, no. 1 p.384-398dAmerican Society of Plant Biologistsx0032-08897nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1104/pp.110.1651263Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03174naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001200152245010900164300001800273500002400291520201300315650001102328650001902339650002302358650001702381650002002398650001802418650001902436650001302455650001902468650001502487650001502502650001602517650002702533700001702560700001702577773011802594852000902712856005502721655001202776IND4412786920221120052341.0081121e200812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441278692DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-2389.2008.01065.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRey, A.10aCarbon mineralization rates at different soil depths across a network of European forest sites (FORCAST)  ap. 1049-1062.  aIncludes references  aMost of the carbon (C) in terrestrial ecosystems is stored in the mineral soil layers. Thus, the response of the mineral soil to potential increases in temperature is crucial for the prediction of the impact of climate change on terrestrial ecosystems. Samples from three mineral soil layers were collected from eight mature forest sites in the European network CARBOEUROFLUX and were incubated at four temperatures (4, 10, 20 and 30°C) for c. 270 days. Carbon mineralization rates were related to soil and site characteristics. Soil water holding capacity, C content, nitrogen (N) content and organic matter all decreased with soil depth at all sites, with significantly larger amounts of organic matter, C and N in the top 0-5 cm of mineral soil than in the deeper layers. The conifer forest soils had significantly lower pH, higher C/N ratios and carbon contents in the top 5 cm than the broadleaf forest soils. Carbon mineralization rates decreased with soil depth and time at all sites but increased with temperature, with the highest rates measured at 30°C for all sites. Between 50 and 70% of the total C respired after 270 days of incubation came from the top 5 cm. The percentage C loss was small in all cases, ranging from 1 to 10%. A two-compartment model was fitted to all data to derive the labile/active and slow/recalcitrant fractions, as well as their decomposition constants. Although the labile fraction was small in all cases, we found significantly larger amounts of labile C in the broadleaf forest soils than in the conifer forest soils. No statistically significant differences were found in the temperature sensitivity parameter Q₁₀ among sites, soil layers or between conifer and broadleaf soils. The average Q₁₀ for all soils was 2.98 (± 0.10). We found that despite large differences among sites, C mineralization can be successfully predicted as a combined function of site leaf area index, mean annual temperature and content of labile carbon in the soil (R² = 0.93). 3acarbon 3aclimate change 3aconiferous forests 3aforest soils 3aleaf area index 3amineral soils 3amineralization 3anitrogen 3aorganic matter 3asoil depth 3asoil water 3atemperature 3awater holding capacity1 aPegoraro, E.1 aJarvis, P.G.0 tEuropean journal of soil science.g2008 Dec., v. 59, no. 6 p.1049-1062dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx1351-07547nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2389.2008.01065.x 7aarticle03566naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004300092040001800135100001500153245015500168300001600323500002400339520223100363650001702594650001102611650002302622650003702645650002202682650002202704650002202726650001902748650002302767650002202790650001102812650001402823650001702837650001002854650001302864651002202877700001302899700001502912773014002927852000903067856005603076655001203132IND4393613120180615000000.0070729e200004  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439361312DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1439-0388.2000x.00240.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDunner, S.10aGenetic structure in Atlantic brown trout (Salmo trutta L.) populations in the Iberian peninsula: evidence from mitochondrial and nuclear DNA analysis  ap. 105-120.  aIncludes references  aBrown trout (Salmo trutta L.) was sampled in rivers belonging to three different Spanish basins in order to analyse the distribution of genetic variability. The genetic analysis was performed by using two systems and techniques: nuclear DNA was screened through random amplified polymorphic DNAs (screening 2 x 10⁵ bp of the whole genome), and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) through sequencing of the hypervariable control region. Genetic distances between the populations were similar using either analysis although some differences arise. For example, some populations of the Tajo basin were very close through nuclear analysis but more distant using mtDNA. Differences between the two DNA sources could be the result of a different evolutionary rate, and the fact that mtDNA is maternally transmitted and differences in sex migration rates will influence the patterns of genetic variation between the transmitted DNAs. Total variation was partitioned using amova showing a clear subdivision among basins although intrapopulation variation remained as high as 62%. A correspondence analysis defined the differences in a three-dimensional way, clustering the populations according to their common basin. When mtDNA was sequenced, higher variability was noted in the segment between 400 and 600 bp of the whole D-loop sequence, suggesting that these 200 bp improved the analysis of the variability more than sequencing the t-RNA ends of the control region. A comparison was made between the t-RNAPro ends of the 10 populations screened here and the rest of the published sequences found in the literature, leading to a concentration of these populations in group IV which includes all trouts which originate in the Atlantic. The analyses performed suggest that a high genetic variability is present in all populations and that although there has been a probable interference from stocked strains introduced to increase population density, this was only detectable through the variance between rivers which reflect different policies according to the region where the basin is located. However, the genetic analysis using the two approaches allows the control of the natural populations avoiding a loss of their genetic potential. 3aSalmo trutta 3abasins 3agender differences 3agenetic techniques and protocols 3agenetic variation 3aissues and policy 3amitochondrial DNA 3anuclear genome 3apopulation density 3apopulation growth 3arivers 3ascreening 3atransfer RNA 3atrout 3avariance 3aIberian Peninsula1 aRoyo, L.1 aCañon, J.0 tJournal of animal breeding and genetics.g2000 Apr., v. 117, no. 2 p.105-120dBlackwell Science, LtdwJournal:jnl57793x0931-26687nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1439-0388.2000x.00240.x 7aarticle03467naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094024002200127024001900149040001800168100003200186245018400218300001600402500002000418506007600438520139700514592002801911596004701939596004701986596003102033596004202064506003702106650001302143650001102156650001302167650001002180650002402190650001102214650002602225650001502251650001202266650001302278650001802291650001302309650002202322650001402344651002602358651002402384700002002408700001902428700001802447700002102465700001902486700001702505700002702522700001602549700005702565773013102622856007902753852000902832655001202841IND60633681120221207072942.0190321e201904  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063368112DNAL7 a10.1111/1758-2229.127392doi7 aPMC68503492pmcid7 a307617732pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSacristán‐Soriano, Oriol10aOntogeny of symbiont community structure in two carotenoid‐rich, viviparous marine sponges: comparison of microbiomes and analysis of culturable pigmented heterotrophic bacteria  ap. 249-261.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aMarine sponges harbour diverse communities of microbes. Mechanisms used to establish microbial symbioses in sponges are poorly understood, and the relative contributions of horizontal and vertical transmission are unknown for most species. We examined microbial communities in adults and larvae of carotenoid‐rich Clathria prolifera and Halichondria bowerbanki from the mid‐Atlantic region of the eastern United States. We sequenced microbiomes from larvae and their mothers and seawater (16S rRNA gene sequencing), and compared microbial community characteristics between species and ambient seawater. The microbial communities in sponges were significantly different than those found in seawater, and each species harboured a distinctive microbiome. Larval microbiomes exhibited significantly lower richness compared with adults, with both sponges appearing to transfer to larvae a particular subset of the adult microbiome. We also surveyed culturable bacteria isolated from larvae of both species. Due to conspicuous coloration of adults and larvae, we focused on pigmented heterotrophic bacteria. We found that the densities of bacteria, in terms of colony‐forming units and pigmented heterotrophic bacteria, were higher in larvae than in seawater. We identified a common mode of transmission (vertical and horizontal) of microbes in both sponges that might differ between species.  aPublisher supplied data  aOCE–0647119cNational Science Foundation  aDEB–0829763cNational Science Foundation  aCTM2017‐88080cAEI/FEDER  a705464cEuropean Union's Horizon 20200 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aPorifera 3aadults 3abacteria 3acolor 3acommunity structure 3alarvae 3amicrobial communities 3amicrobiome 3amothers 3aontogeny 3aribosomal RNA 3aseawater 3asequence analysis 3asymbionts 3aEastern United States 3aMid-Atlantic region1 aWinkler, Marina1 aErwin, Patrick1 aWeisz, Jeremy1 aHarriott, Olivia1 aHeussler, Gary1 aBauer, Emily1 aWest Marsden, Brittany1 aHill, April1 aHill, Malcolm1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0925-72970 tEnvironmental microbiology reports.g2019 Apr., v. 11, no. 2 p.249-261dJohn Wiley & Sons, Inc.wJournal:2217x1758-22297nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1758-2229.127393Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02797naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245010400165300001600269520114000285592002801425650001601453650003101469650001601500650003501516650002701551650002301578650001601601650001701617650001101634650001701645650001901662650001801681650001601699650003701715650001301752650003601765650003601801650003201837653001601869653001501885653001301900653001701913700001801930700001301948700002001961700001601981700001701997700001602014773012202030856008202152852000902234655001202243IND60533058120221120124640.0160728e20140905xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053305812DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbrc.2014.08.0312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Yanzhen10aModulation of cytokine expression in human macrophages by endocrine-disrupting chemical Bisphenol-A  ap. 592-598.  aExposure to environmental endocrine-disrupting chemical Bisphenol-A (BPA) is often associated with dysregulated immune homeostasis, but the mechanisms remain unclear. In the present study, the effects of BPA on the cytokines responses of human macrophages were investigated. Treatment with BPA increased pro-inflammation cytokines tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) production, but decreased anti-inflammation cytokines interleukin-10 (IL-10) and transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) production in THP1 macrophages, as well as in primary human macrophages. BPA effected cytokines expression through estrogen receptor α/β (ERα/β)-dependent mechanism with the evidence of ERα/β antagonist reversed the expression of cytokines. We also identified that activation of extracellular regulated protein kinases (ERK)/nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) signal cascade marked the effects of BPA on cytokines expression. Our results indicated that BPA effected inflammatory responses of macrophages via modulating of cytokines expression, and provided a new insight into the link between exposure to BPA and human health.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantagonists 3aanti-inflammatory activity 3abisphenol A 3aendocrine-disrupting chemicals 3aenvironmental exposure 3aestrogen receptors 3ahomeostasis 3ahuman health 3ahumans 3ainflammation 3ainterleukin-10 3ainterleukin-6 3amacrophages 3amitogen-activated protein kinase 3anecrosis 3atranscription factor NF-kappa B 3atransforming growth factor beta 3atumor necrosis factor-alpha 0aBisphenol-A 0aMacrophage 0aCytokine 0aInflammation1 aMei, Chenfang1 aLiu, Hao1 aWang, Hongsheng1 aZeng, Guoqu1 aLin, Jianhui1 aXu, Meiying0 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2014 Sept. 05, v. 451 p.592-598dElsevier Inc.x0006-291X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2014.08.0313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03177naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245015700167300001600324520175300340592002802093650002102121650003602142650002002178650001902198650001402217650002202231650001102253650001802264650001702282650001802299650001402317650001202331650002802343650002002371650001402391650001802405650001402423700001802437700001802455700001702473700001902490773010502509856008402614852000902698655001202707IND60111951420221116154442.0141110e201109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011195142DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbagen.2011.06.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNam, Mi-Hyun10aMonocyte-endothelium-smooth muscle cell interaction in co-culture: Proliferation and cytokine productions in response to advanced glycation end products  ap. 907-912.  aBACKGROUND: During hyperglycemia, reducing sugars react with the amino groups to form Amadori products which then form advanced glycation end-products (AGEs). Studies have shown that the AGEs and the receptor binding generated reactive oxygen species, and triggered secretion of cytokines contributing to the local regulations of proliferation and inflammation in cells. Interaction of vessel wall cells and monocytes may trigger the processes leading to atherosclerosis. We evaluated the effects of AGEs on smooth muscle cell (SMC) proliferation and cytokine synthesis in co-cultures of human monocytes (THP-1), endothelial cells (HUVEC) and aortic vascular smooth muscle cell (SMC) to clarify the effects of AGEs on vascular cells and to investigate the mechanisms of arteriosclerosis. METHODS: Glycolaldehyde-induced AGEs (glycol-AGEs) was prepared. The THP-1 and HUVEC were cultured with SMC in transwell plates with 100μg/ml of glycol-AGEs for 24 to 48h. RESULTS: The proliferation of SMC was induced by glycol-AGEs in the co-culture system. Moreover, SMC treated with glycol-AGEs also expressed interleukin-6 (IL-6) and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), and the level of cytokines expression was significantly elevated in the co-culture system of HUVEC and THP-1 when treated with glycol-AGEs. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that employing a co-culture system is necessary to investigate the synergistic effects of AGEs on intercellular cellular interactions and it creates a more in vivo-like environment for AGEs implicated atherosclerosis research. GENERAL SIGNIFICANCE: All three cell types are required to be investigated together to understand the effects of AGEs on intercellular interactions occurring among these cells.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAmadori products 3aadvanced glycation end products 3aatherosclerosis 3achemokine CCL2 3acoculture 3aendothelial cells 3ahumans 3ahyperglycemia 3ainflammation 3ainterleukin-6 3amonocytes 3amuscles 3areactive oxygen species 3areducing sugars 3asecretion 3asmooth muscle 3asynergism1 aLee, Hyun-Sun1 aSeomun, Young1 aLee, Yanhouy1 aLee, Kwang-Won0 tBiochimica et biophysica acta.g2011 Sept., v. 1810, no. 9 p.907-912dElsevier B.V.x0304-41657nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbagen.2011.06.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03254naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002200139245017200161300001800333520185300351592002802204650002202232650001702254650002502271650002302296650001402319650003802333650002002371650003102391650001502422650001802437650001502455650001302470650001302483650001702496700002402513700002302537700002202560700002202582773013202604856007502736852000902811655001202820IND60539171520170621000000.0160815e20140618xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053917152DNAL7 a10.1021/ja504074g2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKnott, Brandon
C.10aCarbohydrate–Protein Interactions That Drive Processive Polysaccharide Translocation in Enzymes Revealed from a Computational Study of Cellobiohydrolase Processivity  ap. 8810-8819.  aTranslocation of carbohydrate polymers through protein tunnels and clefts is a ubiquitous biochemical phenomenon in proteins such as polysaccharide synthases, glycoside hydrolases, and carbohydrate-binding modules. Although static snapshots of carbohydrate polymer binding in proteins have long been studied via crystallography and spectroscopy, the molecular details of polysaccharide chain processivity have not been elucidated. Here, we employ simulation to examine how a cellulose chain translocates by a disaccharide unit during the processive cycle of a glycoside hydrolase family 7 cellobiohydrolase. Our results demonstrate that these biologically and industrially important enzymes employ a two-step mechanism for chain threading to form a Michaelis complex and that the free energy barrier to chain threading is significantly lower than the hydrolysis barrier. Taken with previous studies, our findings suggest that the rate-limiting step in enzymatic cellulose degradation is the glycosylation reaction, not chain processivity. Based on the simulations, we find that strong electrostatic interactions with polar residues that are conserved in GH7 cellobiohydrolases, but not in GH7 endoglucanases, at the leading glucosyl ring provide the thermodynamic driving force for polysaccharide chain translocation. Also, we consider the role of aromatic–carbohydrate interactions, which are widespread in carbohydrate-active enzymes and have long been associated with processivity. Our analysis suggests that the primary role for these aromatic residues is to provide tunnel shape and guide the carbohydrate chain to the active site. More broadly, this work elucidates the role of common protein motifs found in carbohydrate-active enzymes that synthesize or depolymerize polysaccharides by chain translocation mechanisms coupled to catalysis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGibbs free energy 3aactive sites 3acarbohydrate binding 3acatalytic activity 3acellulose 3acellulose 1,4-beta-cellobiosidase 3acrystallography 3aelectrostatic interactions 3aglycosides 3aglycosylation 3ahydrolysis 3apolymers 3aproteins 3aspectroscopy1 aCrowley, Michael F.1 aHimmel, Michael E.1 aStåhlberg, Jerry1 aBeckham, Gregg T.0 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2014 June 18, v. 136, no. 24 p.8810-8819dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-51267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fja504074g3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02973naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245010200169300001300271520180000284592002802084650001302112650001602125650001002141650001202151650001202163650002002175650000902195650001402204650001402218700002302232700002402255700001902279700003102298700002202329773010802351856008402459990002302543852000902566655001202575IND60097871520221118062414.0141104e20120815xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009787152DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ejphar.2012.05.0222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKadiri, Nabila10aDiverse effects of 5-HT₂C receptor blocking agents on c-Fos expression in the rat basal ganglia  ap. 8-16.  aSerotonin(2C) receptors (5-HT₂C) exert continuous control on the activity of specific populations of neurons in the basal ganglia. While antagonists block the effect of endogenous 5-HT at 5-HT₂C receptors, the actions of inverse agonists may also involve interruption of activity at constitutively active populations of 5-HT₂C receptors. We have evaluated the regional impact of these controls by studying, in rats, the expression of the product of the proto-oncogene c-Fos in rat basal ganglia after peripheral doses of the 5-HT₂C antagonist SB 243213 (5-methyl-1-[[2-[(2-methyl-3-pyridyl)oxy]-5-pyridyl]carbamoyl]-6-trifluoromethylindoline) and the 5-HT₂B/₂C inverse agonists SB 206553 (5-methyl-1-(3-pyridylcarbamoyl)-1,2,3,5-tetrahydropyrrolo[2,3-f]indole.hydrochloride) and S32006 (N-pyridin-3-yl-1,2-dihydro-3H-benzo[e]indole-3-carboxamide). The results show that 1 and 10mg/kg SB 243213 enhanced equally c-Fos expression in the subthalamic nucleus (STN) and dose-dependently in the striatum and nucleus accumbens core (NAcc). SB 206553 (1–10mg/kg), at 10mg/kg only, enhanced c-Fos expression in STN, striatum (except the dorsomedial part), NAcc, entopeduncular nucleus, substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr) and compacta (SNc) and ventral tegmental area. S32006 induced a similar increase in c-Fos expression in the medial parts of the striatum and NAcc at doses of 1–10mg/kg while it dose-dependently enhanced c-Fos expression in medial parts of the STN and SNr. None of these drugs induced c-Fos expression in the globus pallidus. The distinct pattern of c-Fos expression elicited by the 5-HT₂C antagonist and inverse agonists suggests the existence of cellular and functional heterogeneity in the response of the basal ganglia to drugs inhibiting 5-HT₂C receptors.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagonists 3aantagonists 3adrugs 3aganglia 3aneurons 3aproto-oncogenes 3arats 3areceptors 3aserotonin1 aLagière, Mélanie1 aLe Moine, Catherine1 aMillan, Mark J1 aDeurwaerdere, Philippe de,1 aNavailles, Sylvia0 tEuropean journal of pharmacology.g2012 Aug. 15, v. 689, no. 1-3 p.8-16dElsevier B.V.x0014-29997nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ejphar.2012.05.0223Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02998naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094024002200133024001900155040001800174100002100192245006900213300001800282506007600300520120000376592002801576596005301604596005801657596002901715596001401744596004701758596005701805596004701862596004401909596003301953596007901986506003702065650001502102650002502117650001902142650003002161650001302191650002302204700002302227700001902250700001902269773012102288856008602409852000902495655001202504IND60624954120221207125154.0191017e20180701xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062495412DNAL7 a10.1093/bioinformatics/bty2622doi7 aPMC60225612pmcid7 a299500132pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMahlich, Yannick10aHFSP: high speed homology-driven function annotation of proteins  ap. i304-i312.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe rapid drop in sequencing costs has produced many more (predicted) protein sequences than can feasibly be functionally annotated with wet-lab experiments. Thus, many computational methods have been developed for this purpose. Most of these methods employ homology-based inference, approximated via sequence alignments, to transfer functional annotations between proteins. The increase in the number of available sequences, however, has drastically increased the search space, thus significantly slowing down alignment methods. Here we describe homology-derived functional similarity of proteins (HFSP), a novel computational method that uses results of a high-speed alignment algorithm, MMseqs2, to infer functional similarity of proteins on the basis of their alignment length and sequence identity. We show that our method is accurate (85% precision) and fast (more than 40-fold speed increase over state-of-the-art). HFSP can help correct at least a 16% error in legacy curations, even for a resource of as high quality as Swiss-Prot. These findings suggest HFSP as an ideal resource for large-scale functional annotation efforts.

Combination of different solar trackers can be a feasible option to stabilize output fluctuations. The main aim of this study was to analyze the optimal capacity allocation of multiple solar trackers and storage capacity. In this regard, a multi-objective optimization model considering fluctuations and the net present value was developed. A desert area in the west of China was considered as the case study. Results indicate that: (1) horizontal-axis trackers and its bifacial modules have complementarity with other kinds of solar trackers; (2) fluctuations of the photovoltaic plant with optimal capacity allocation can be significantly reduced; (3) optimal capacity allocation is sensitive to the feed-in tariff and the adjustment value of automatic generation control; (4) energy storage is crucial to improving the stability of the photovoltaic system while its capacity is constrained by the cost. The novel capacity allocation method does not only improve the stability and benefit of the utility-scale grid-connected photovoltaic plant but also provides a valuable reference for the optimal utilization of other renewable energy resources worldwide.  aPublisher supplied data 3acase studies 3adeserts 3aenergy 3amodels 3asolar collectors 3asolar energy 3atariffs 3aChina 0aSolar trackers 0aCapacity allocation 0aEnergy storage 0aTypical weather 0aComplementary demand1 aMa, Chao1 aLian, Jijian1 aPang, Xiulan1 aYang, Weichao0 tApplied energy.g2019 Mar. 15, v. 238 p.721-733dElsevier LtdwJournal:11876x0306-26197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2019.01.0993Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02997naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245013800170300001600308520138100324592002801705650002001733650002101753650001601774650002001790650004301810650001101853650001201864650001301876650002801889650001801917650001901935650002101954650001701975650002201992650000902014650001402023700002002037700001802057700001702075700002002092700002002112700002002132700002102152700002002173700002002193700002102213700002302234773010502257856008402362852000902446655001202455IND60111951720221116154534.0141110e201109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011195172DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbagen.2011.06.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKoyama, Satoshi14aThe induction of human CL-P1 expression in hypoxia/reoxygenation culture condition and rat CL-P1 after ischemic/reperfusion treatment  ap. 836-842.  aBACKGROUND: Oxidative stress-induced endothelial dysfunction and oxidized low-density lipoprotein (LDL) might play a key role in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. We recently identified a vascular endothelial scavenger receptor, collectin placenta 1 (CL-P1), which acts as a receptor for oxidized LDL as well as for microbes. METHODS: We demonstrate how hypoxic and oxidative stress induced CL-P1 expression and compared their effects with the expression of lectin-like oxidized low-density lipoprotein receptor 1 (LOX-1), an endothelial scavenger receptor expressed by oxidative stress. RESULTS: Hypoxia/reoxygenation induced CL-P1 mRNA and protein expression in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). The expression of LOX-1 mRNA in these cells peaked slightly at 24h, while the expression of CL-P1 had an onset at 72h and was sustained for 120h after reoxygenation. Furthermore, the exposure of rat carotid artery endothelium to ischemia/reperfusion increased the maximal CL-P1 mRNA expression at 72h and expression of its protein peaked at 7days after this treatment. We demonstrate that CL-P1 up-regulation is induced in vitro and in vivo by oxidative stress. GENERAL SIGNIFICANCE: The inducible expression of CL-P1 by oxidative stress might play a crucial role in endothelial dysfunction or chronic activation leading to the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aatherosclerosis 3acarotid arteries 3aendothelium 3agene expression 3ahuman umbilical vein endothelial cells 3ahumans 3ahypoxia 3aischemia 3alow density lipoprotein 3amessenger RNA 3amicroorganisms 3aoxidative stress 3apathogenesis 3aprotein synthesis 3arats 3areceptors1 aOhtani, Katsuki1 aFukuzawa, Jun1 aYao, Naoyuki1 aFukuda, Mitsuko1 aJang, Seong-Jae1 aHasebe, Naoyuki1 aKikuchi, Kenjiro1 aItabe, Hiroyuki1 aYoshida, Itsuro1 aSuzuki, Yasuhiko1 aWakamiya, Nobutaka0 tBiochimica et biophysica acta.g2011 Sept., v. 1810, no. 9 p.836-842dElsevier B.V.x0304-41657nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbagen.2011.06.0133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04156naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001500147245014300162300001800305520260700323592002802930650002102958650001502979650001202994650002203006650001203028650001103040650002003051650001403071650001003085650002003095650001903115650001503134650001103149650000703160650001303167650001403180650002003194650001603214650002203230650002903252650000903281700001503290700001803305700001303323700001603336700001403352700001703366700001803383773011103401856008103512852000903593655001203602IND60580787220221122224728.0171001e201710  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058078722DNAL7 a10.1007/s12649-016-9722-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWu, Zhiwei10aDevelopment of Escherichia coli Strain with Enhanced Enzymatic Activity of Acetyl Esterase Using a Strategy of Tandem Repetitive Promoters  ap. 2339-2348.  aPURPOSE: Acetyl esterase (AE) plays an important role in bioconversion of lignocellulosic biomass. However, the expression of AE from wild type strains is at relatively low level. The study aims to construct an engineered Escherichia coli strain with enhanced enzymatic activity of AE by adopting the strategy of tandem repetitive promoters. METHODS: The ybaC gene that encodes AE was cloned from E. coli RB3, and then the expression vector pKK223-3-ybaC was constructed. The vector pKK223-3-ybaC was introduced into E. coli JM110. LB medium plus 50 mg L⁻¹ ampicillin was used as selective medium for transformants screening. The recombinant strain E. coli JM110 (pKK223-3-ybaC) (EcKy) was thus obtained. In-Fusion kit (Takara) was used to insert core-tac-promoter (Ctac) into the vector pKK223-3-ybaC to generate pKTRP-ybaC according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Then, the plasmid was introduced into E. coli JM110 and another recombinant strain E. coli JM110 (pKTRP-ybaC) (EcTy) was constructed. EcKy and EcTy were cultured with LB medium that contained 50 mg L⁻¹ ampicillin. IPTG was added after being cultured for 6 h. Meanwhile, for the no-induced groups, an equal amount of sterilized water was added. E. coli RB3 was cultured with LB medium similar to the above excluding ampicillin and IPTG. The activity of AE produced by EcKy, EcTy and E. coli RB3 were determined by using Colombatto’s method. Transcriptional level of ybaC in the parental strain E. coli RB3, EcKy and EcTy were analyzed. And the effect of temperature, pH and metal ions on purified AE from EcKy and EcTy were investigated. RESULTS: AE was overexpressed under the control of a strong tac promoter. The highest activity of AE from EcKy was 42.66 U mL⁻¹, which was 115 folds of that from E. coli RB3. AE activity from EcTy was 48.65 U mL⁻¹, which was 131 folds of that from E. coli RB3. The assay of transcriptional level for the engineered strains and the wild type strain E. coli RB3 showed that the transformant with tandem repetitive promoters had the highest level of transcription. Thermal stability of AE from EcKy and EcTy was improved significantly compared to the crude enzyme from the parental strain E. coli RB3. The activity of AE from the two engineered strains was promoted by Co²⁺, Ni²⁺, Ca²⁺ and Zn²⁺ at appropriate concentrations. CONCLUSIONS: EcKy and EcTy possessing higher activity of AE were constructed successfully. The results confirmed the feasibility of improving AE activity by constructing an engineered bacterial strain with tandem repetitive promoters.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3aampicillin 3abiomass 3abiotransformation 3acalcium 3acobalt 3aenzyme activity 3aesterases 3agenes 3agenetic vectors 3alignocellulose 3ametal ions 3anickel 3apH 3aplasmids 3ascreening 3aselective media 3atemperature 3athermal stability 3atranscription (genetics) 3azinc1 aChen, Jing1 aZhang, Zunhao1 aMa, Lina1 aXu, Tianhui1 aYu, Haiye1 aZhang, Qiang1 aChen, Yuxiang0 tWaste and biomass valorization.g2017 Oct., v. 8, no. 7 p.2339-2348dSpringer Netherlandsx1877-26417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12649-016-9722-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04267naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002400150245015400174500002200328520266100350592002803011650002003039650003003059650001203089650001903101650002603120650001903146650001203165650001403177650002303191650002403214650001303238650002203251650002003273650001603293650001003309651001203319653001703331653001703348653002103365653001803386653002403404653002503428653001703453653003203470653002103502653001203523700001903535773011103554856005103665852000903716655001203725IND60795516820221123032307.0221004e20220928xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079551682DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foreco.2022.1205682doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZampieri, Nicole E.14aThe effects of fire, climate, and species composition on longleaf pine stand structure and growth rates across diverse natural communities in Florida  aPre-press version  aThe longleaf pine (Pinus palustris) savanna is an endangered ecosystem within a global biodiversity hotspot. However, most studies of longleaf habitats have not considered their distinct structure and function among unique communities, which are critical for developing appropriate management strategies. We aim to assess how differences in climate, fire, and species composition interact and relate to longleaf pine densities and growth rates in distinct communities. We surveyed longleaf pine stand structure (density by size and age classes) and estimated growth rates using 516 tree cores across 5 community types (69 plots, each ≤ 160 m²). Surveys covered the range of longleaf pine in Florida, USA, including the southernmost extent of the species range, and included all communities where longleaf are dominant (sandhill, upland pine, and mesic, wet, and scrubby flatwoods). We used an NMDS ordination to classify communities by species composition. We used linear mixed-effects models to examine the effect of community type on longleaf pine density and growth rates and then used recursive partitioning and regression tree analyses to identify how climate, fire, and species composition affect density and growth rates. We found that stand structure and species composition were different across communities, with upland pine being the most species rich and having the highest density of mature trees, whereas growth rates were not statistically different across communities. Across communities, unique interactions between climate, fire, and species composition, resulted in differences in stand structure and growth rates. In general, tree and grass stage densities were best predicted by species composition and fire rather than by climate, whereas growth rates were best predicted by climate. Having included the southernmost extent of longleafs range we show that longleaf growth rates increased with higher temperatures, but this effect is reversed in dry conditions. Our results suggest that longleaf growth rates across its range will be more sensitive to current and future climate change than longleaf population density. Furthermore, while controlling competition from hardwoods has been a focus of longleaf restoration, our results suggest that species that facilitate longleaf establishment may be equally important in restoring and managing these habitats. Managers should design and apply regional and community specific plans that take into account relationships between fire and associated species composition under a changing climate, which will influence strand structure and tree growth differently in different communities.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPinus palustris 3aadministrative management 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3aendangered ecosystems 3aforest ecology 3agrasses 3ahighlands 3apopulation density 3aregression analysis 3asavannas 3aspecies diversity 3astand structure 3atree growth 3atrees 3aFlorida 0aBiodiversity 0aconservation 0adendrochronology 0adendroecology 0aecosystem processes 0aecosystem management 0afire ecology 0aglobal biodiversity hotspot 0aregression trees 0asavanna1 aPau, Stephanie0 tForest ecology and management.g2022 Sept. 28,  p.120568-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl9013x0378-11277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foreco.2022.120568  aDNAL 7aarticle02985naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002300149245007600172300001800248500002000266500000900286520148000295592002801775596003801803596005201841596006201893650001301955650001501968650000901983650001601992650001502008650001802023650002002041650002602061650001302087650001502100650001702115650001802132650001702150651001302167700002502180700002202205700001602227700002102243773013402264856008402398852000902482655001202491IND60677165420221121001220.0220805e201909  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067716542DNAL7 a10.2135/cropsci2019.04.02342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRankoth, Lalith M.10aCover Crop Effects on Corn Plant Sap Flow Rates and Soil Water Dynamics  ap. 2227-2236.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aepub  aCover crops (CC) are used for soil quality improvement. However, the effects of CC on soil water availability for cash crop is yet inconclusive. Plant sap flow measurement techniques are among the most reliable methods to evaluate water stress and water consumption by measuring the whole‐plant transpiration. The objective of the study was to quantify plant sap flow dynamics in corn (Zea mays L.), soil water dynamics, and corn yields in response to CC and no cover crop (NCC) management. The study was conducted at Bradford Research Center, University of Missouri, Columbia, in 2017 and 2018. A Dynamax Flow32‐1K sap flow measurement system and a CR1000 data logger with Dynagage sensors were used to measure sap flow rates. Volumetric soil moisture (VSM) content was estimated at 15‐min intervals by Campbell CS‐616 sensors installed at 10‐, 20‐, and 30‐cm soil depths in 2018. The NCC corn plants had greater daily average sap flow rates early and lower sap flow rates later in the season compared with CC. The CC treatment showed significantly greater VSM than NCC, with 14, 12, and 4% greater values at 10‐, 20‐, and 30‐cm depths, respectively. Corn yield in 2017 was significantly greater in NCC treatment than in the CC treatment, with values of 8.07 Mg ha⁻¹ in CC and 9.41 Mg ha⁻¹ in NCC. This study revealed that soils of CC treatment maintained greater soil moisture conditions and provided more water to corn plants for a longer period.  aPublisher supplied data  cUSDA‐NRCS Missouri State Office  cUniversity of Missouri Bradford Research Center  cCenter for Agroforestry, University of Missouri, Columbia 3aZea mays 3acash crops 3acorn 3acover crops 3acrop yield 3ahydrodynamics 3amicroprocessors 3aplant available water 3asap flow 3asoil depth 3asoil quality 3atranspiration 3awater stress 3aMissouri1 aUdawatta, Ranjith P.1 aGantzer, Clark J.1 aJose, Shibu1 aNelson, Kelly A.0 tCrop science.g2019 Sept., v. 59, no. 5 p.2227-2236dThe Crop Science Society of America, Inc.wJournal:jnl44570x0011-183X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2135/cropsci2019.04.02343Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04090naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245018600170500002200356520246900378592002802847650002102875650002402896650001702920650001702937650003002954650001102984650002302995650001903018650002103037650002203058650001403080650000903094650001503103651001903118653002203137653002803159653002003187653004403207700002003251700001803271700001903289700002203308700002503330700001903355773012603374856005103500961001203551852000903563655001203572IND60795516920221123042222.0221004e20220928xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079551692DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foreco.2022.1205692doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBrown, Shawn P.10aComparisons of interspecies field performance of Fagaceae (Castanea and Quercus) planted in the southeastern United States with attention to soil fungal impacts on plant performance  aPre-press version  aThe loss of Fagaceae species is an increasing concern globally, including in North American where American chestnut (Castanea dentata) has been virtually eliminated by non-native pathogens, and oaks (Quercus) are experiencing widespread regeneration failures and declines. Tree improvement and breeding programs are producing trees for disease resistance or improved performance traits but require field testing to refine efforts. We established a study in 2015 on a xeric pitch pine (Pinus rigida) site in the Blue Ridge Mountains of North Carolina to regenerate American chestnut and interspecies hybrids (BC₃F₃) and the co-occurring species of white oak (Q. alba) through planting bare-root, quality-graded seedlings. Chinese chestnut (C. mollissima) was also tested as a control species. We used pedigreed seed sources from open-pollinated genetic families that were nursery grown (1-0 bareroot seedlings for chestnut, 2-0 bareroot seedlings for white oak) to maximize overall size and competitive ability. Though there was variability within and among plant families in performance, American chestnut and BC₃F₃ hybrids generally outperformed Chinese chestnut (at least 13% taller) and white oak (at least 29% taller) for the first three years, but intraspecies differences among genetic families were significant for nearly all traits tested. Initial seedling root morphology poorly explained field performance (R²<0.17), but this relationship was significant for both white oak families and the only northern BC₃F₃ seed source. American chestnuts and BC₃F₃ hybrids had higher stem height to ground diameter ratios compared to white oak (at least 11% greater), indicating that white oak likely concentrates more resources to root development while chestnut concentrates more resources to maintaining above-ground competitive advantages. Additionally, we investigated soil fungal communities, both pre- and post-tree establishment and tested if these fungal communities can be used to predict plant performance or health. Soil fungi did a poor job predicting plant performance. Our results indicate that co-occurring Fagaceae species can be established in restoration plantings using well developed quality seedlings on relatively xeric sites. Managers should use diverse seed sources to avoid planting poor performing families and expect that chestnuts bred for blight resistance will outcompete planted white oak, at least in the short-term.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCastanea dentata 3aCastanea mollissima 3aPinus rigida 3aQuercus alba 3aadministrative management 3ablight 3adisease resistance 3aforest ecology 3aopen pollination 3aplant improvement 3aseedlings 3asoil 3asoil fungi 3aNorth Carolina 0aAmerican chestnut 0aArtificial regeneration 0achestnut hybrid 0areforestation, Quercus alba, soil fungi1 aClark, Stacy L.1 aFord, Emerald1 aJumpponen, Ari1 aSaxton, Arnold M.1 aSchlarbaum, Scott E.1 aBaird, Richard0 tForest ecology and management.g2022 Sept. 28,  p.120569-dElsevier B.V.aElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl9013x0378-11277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foreco.2022.120569  aUSDA/FS  aDNAL 7aarticle02909naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003800113040001800151100001700169245019700186300001600383520140400399592002801803650002501831650001301856650001201869650000901881650001301890650001201903650003701915650000901952650003801961650004601999650005102045650000902096650002502105650005402130700001802184700001602202700001802218773011102236856008402347990002302431852000902454655001202463IND60097871820221118062456.0141104e20120815xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009787182DNAL7 a226595882pmid7 a10.1016/j.ejphar.2012.05.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBai, Yunjing10aDifferential patterns of neuronal activation in rostral versus caudal ventral tegmental area involved in behavioral sensitization induced by an escalating-dose morphine administration paradigm  ap. 118-124.  aThe transition to addiction often involves a gradual process of escalated drug intake. The purpose of the present study was to characterize neuronal activation in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and substantia nigra (SN) following chronic escalating-dose morphine exposure (days 1–7, 2mg/kg/d; days 8–21, beginning at 10mg/kg/d, increasing by 2mg/kg/d), with steady-dose morphine (2mg/kg/d, i.p., for 21 days) as the comparison. Using immunohistochemical double-staining for tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and Fos, we found that the number of Fos⁺TH⁺ neurons in the rostral VTA and number of Fos⁺TH⁻ neurons in the lateral SNr were significantly increased in escalating-dose morphine-treated rats compared with steady-dose morphine-treated rats and acute morphine-treated rats. Meanwhile, this increase was associated with robust expression of behavioral sensitization after a challenge with 10mg/kg morphine. The number of Fos⁺TH⁺ neurons was significantly increased by acute morphine in the caudal VTA and SNc, but this number did not increase further with morphine pretreatment. These results demonstrate that behavioral sensitization was associated with elevated activation of dopaminergic neurons in the rostral VTA and nondopaminergic neurons in the lateral SNr, which could only be induced by chronic escalating-dose morphine rather than chronic steady-dose morphine pretreatment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aimmunohistochemistry 3amorphine 3aneurons 3arats 3atyrosine 2aAnimals 2aDose-Response Relationship, Drug 2aMale 2aMorphinexadministration & dosage 2aMotor Activityxdrug effectsxphysiology. 2aNeuronsxdrug effectsxmetabolismxphysiology. 2aRats 2aRats, Sprague-Dawley 2aVentral Tegmental Areaxdrug effectsxphysiology.1 aPeng, Yonghua1 aLiang, Jing1 aZheng, Xigeng0 tEuropean journal of pharmacology.g2012 Aug. 15, v. 689, no. 1-3 p.118-124dElsevier B.V.x0014-29997nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ejphar.2012.05.0113Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03815naa a2200661 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024003800135040001800173100002000191245007400211300001500285520178200300592002802082650001902110650003502129650001602164650002202180650002002202650003502222650001802257650000902275650001102284650001302295650001402308650001602322650000902338650001402347650001602361650001502377650001202392650004802404650006002452650004402512650002002556650000902576650000902585650002302594650002102617650004502638650004502683650004302728650002202771700002402793700001602817700001902833700002102852700002202873700002002895773011002915856008403025990002303109852000903132655001203141IND60097871920221118062419.0141104e20120815xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009787192DNAL7 a226595852pmid7 aPMC34025872pmcid7 a10.1016/j.ejphar.2012.05.0292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFitting, Sylvia10aMorphine efficacy is altered in conditional HIV-1 Tat transgenic mice  ap. 96-103.  aOpiate abuse reportedly can exaggerate complications of human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV-1) infection in the central nervous system (CNS), while opiate drugs are often indicated in the treatment of HIV-1-related neuropathic pain. Despite this quandary, few studies have assessed the relationship between the duration or extent of HIV-1 infection and the intrinsic neurobehavioral responsiveness to opioids. To address this problem, doxycycline (DOX)-inducible HIV-Tat₁₋₈₆ transgenic mice were used as a model for HIV-1-associated neurocognitive disorders, which permitted the regulation of Tat exposure and duration. The effects of continuous Tat induction on the activity of morphine were examined at weekly intervals using standard behavioral assays for nociception and motor function. In the spinal cord, Tat mRNA levels did not increase until the second and third weeks following induction, which corresponded to a significant loss of morphine antinociception as assessed in the tail-flick test. Alternatively, in the striatum, sustained increases in Tat mRNA expression during the second week of induction coincided with significant decreases in rotarod performance and interactions with morphine. Importantly, the behavioral effects of morphine differed depending on the timing and location of Tat expression, with increases in Tat transcript levels in the spinal cord and striatum corresponding to significant alterations in morphine-dependent nociception and rotarod performance, respectively. Assuming Tat levels contribute to the clinical manifestations of HIV-1, the results suggest that regional differences in viral load and opioid phenotype might influence the nature and degree that opiate responsiveness is altered in HIV-1-infected individuals.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHIV infections 3aHuman immunodeficiency virus 1 3adoxycycline 3aexposure duration 3agene expression 3agenetically modified organisms 3amessenger RNA 3amice 3amodels 3amorphine 3anarcotics 3anociception 3apain 3aphenotype 3aspinal cord 3aviral load 2aAnimals 2aBehavior, Animalxdrug effectsxphysiology. 2aGene Products, tatxbiosynthesisxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aHIV Infectionsxdrug therapyxgenetics. 2aHIV-1xgenetics 2aMale 2aMice 2aMice, Inbred C57BL 2aMice, Transgenic 2aMorphinexpharmacologyxtherapeutic use. 2aPain Measurementxdrug effectsxmethods. 2aSpinal Cordxdrug effectsxmetabolism. 2aTreatment Outcome1 aScoggins, Krista L.1 aXu, Ruqiang1 aDever, Seth M.1 aKnapp, Pamela E.1 aDewey, William L.1 aHauser, Kurt F.0 tEuropean journal of pharmacology.g2012 Aug. 15, v. 689, no. 1-3 p.96-103dElsevier B.V.x0014-29997nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ejphar.2012.05.0293Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02981naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001600150245013900166300001600305520180400321592002802125650001702153650001902170650001402189650001402203650000902217650001502226650002302241650001402264650000902278700001602287700001402303700001902317700001602336700001502352700001802367773010502385856008402490852000902574655001202583IND60111952120221116154439.0141110e201109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011195212DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbagen.2011.05.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLaw, J.K.Y.14aThe significance of chloride in the inhibitory action of disodium cromoglycate on immunologically-stimulated rat peritoneal mast cells  ap. 867-874.  aBACKGROUND: The microelectrode array (MEA) was used to investigate the pharmacological relevance of chloride (Cl⁻) ions in antigen-dependent mast cell activation and the inhibitory effect of disodium cromoglycate (DSCG) on mast cell activation. METHODS: The movements of ions across the cellular membrane and the potential relationship between Cl⁻ channels and DSCG during immunological activation were investigated using the MEA. The results were then subsequently compared with the amount of histamine released from anti-IgE activated peritoneal mast cells. RESULTS: The inclusion of charybdotoxin (ChTX) in Cl⁻-free buffer showed that the measured field potentials during antigen-stimulated peritoneal mast cell were a combination of Cl⁻ influx and K⁺ efflux. The delayed onset time of Cl⁻ influx indicated the presence of a delayed outwardly-rectifying Cl⁻ current in the antigen-stimulated peritoneal mast cells. The use of 5-nitro-2-(3-phenylpropylamino) benzoic acid demonstrated that the activated mast cell membrane potential can be stabilised, thereby reducing the amount of histamine released from the anti-IgE activated mast cells. The correlation between the results of the histamine release assay and the electrophysiological measurements demonstrated the importance of Cl⁻ to anti-IgE dependent mast cell activation. The inhibitory effect of DSCG on anti-IgE activated cells, however, did not correlate with the presumed influx of Cl⁻. CONCLUSIONS: The MEA data suggest that Cl⁻ influx is crucial to IgE-dependent mast cell degranulation. GENERAL SIGNIFICANCE: While the MEA cannot yield information about single channel properties, it is convenient to use and can provide information on the global changes in electrophysiological responses of non-excitable cells.  aPublisher supplied data 3abenzoic acid 3acell membranes 3achlorides 3ahistamine 3aions 3amast cells 3amembrane potential 3apotassium 3arats1 aYeung, C.K.1 aWan, S.P.1 aIngebrandt, S.1 aLau, H.Y.A.1 aRudd, J.A.1 aChan, Maisie,0 tBiochimica et biophysica acta.g2011 Sept., v. 1810, no. 9 p.867-874dElsevier B.V.x0304-41657nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbagen.2011.05.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02135naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001400140245007500154300001600229520095800245592002801203650001701231650002101248650002101269650001701290650001601307650001401323650002601337650002101363650000701384700001501391700001601406700001501422700001801437700001601455700001801471700001601489773013701505856007401642852000901716655001201725IND60618543520221120094037.0181030e20180117xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061854352DNAL7 a10.1039/c7tb01851g2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXu, Liang10aBiodegradable pH-responsive hydrogels for controlled dual-drug release  ap. 510-517.  aDual-drug loaded pH-responsive hydrogels were prepared as a delivery system carrying, as exemplars, both anti-cancer and anti-bacterial agents for pH controlled drug release.

This shortcoming is due to the use of numerous fitting functions to evaluate Raman spectra of carbon fibers and the inconsistencies in establishing the best fitting models in a statistically robust fashion. To address this gap, we present a comprehensive work on the Raman spectra of carbon fibers that combines a vast library of experimental data with a robust numerical analysis and a statistical evaluation of a wide range of suggested fitting models. This manuscript begins with a brief review of the commonly applied fitting models. Then, the Raman spectra of 32 commercially available polyacrylonitrile-based carbon fibers collected at excitation wavelengths 532, 633, and 785 nm are presented and the best fit for all fibers is evaluated based on several statistical criteria in conjunction with numerical calculations and physical arguments. The results suggest that high-performance fibers must be fit with at least five peaks, whereas high-tensile modulus fibers are best fit with at least six distinct peaks. Finally, we employ simultaneous fitting of the Raman spectra of specific fibers and wavelengths and demonstrate that strong correlations exist between mechanical properties and the D1 peak position and shape across the range of evaluated mechanical properties. We suggest straightforward improvements in fitting analysis procedures that can be implemented to increase coherency in the understanding of the underlying carbon fiber microstructure intuited from Raman spectroscopy.  aPublisher supplied data  aDE-AC05-00OR22725cU.S. Department of Energy 3aRaman spectroscopy 3acarbon 3acarbon fibers 3amicrostructure 3aquantitative analysis1 aLangford, J.

This study focused on the governance and management of wayuri palms (Pholidostachys synanthera robusta), whose leaves are harvested for roof thatch, in Ecuadorian Amazonia. Combining ethnographic methods with field botanic inventory, it was shown that although local institutions regulating leaf harvest had existed for longer than living memory, and the degree of compliance was high, they did not prevent exhaustion of the resource base, only delayed it.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3acompliance 3agovernance 3ainventories 3aleaves 3asocioeconomics 3athatch 3aAmazonia0 tAmbio.g2017 Nov., v. 46, no. 7 p.812-824dSpringer Netherlandsx0044-74477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13280-017-0917-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03068naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002000140245013300160300001600293520159000309592002801899650002301927650002501950650002101975650001801996650001202014650002202026650001702048650003102065650001902096650001902115650001902134650001302153650002202166650001702188650002502205650000902230700001802239700001802257700001202275700001502287700001902302700001502321700001702336773013802353856007402491852000902565655001202574IND60641883820221119104221.0190506e20170103xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064188382DNAL7 a10.1039/c6ta07567c2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSoyekwo, Faizal10aMetal in situ surface functionalization of polymer-grafted-carbon nanotube composite membranes for fast efficient nanofiltration  ap. 583-592.  aThe development of inorganic functionalized membranes with the capacity to effectively separate molecules or ions in solutions based on the size or electrostatic interactions is pivotal to purification and separation applications. Herein, we demonstrate a novel green strategy utilizing a completely aqueous process to construct an asymmetrically structured metal surface functionalized polymer–matrix nanocomposite nanofiltration membrane. Crosslinked polyethyleneimine (PEI) is grafted on a carboxylated carbon nanotube intermediate layer incorporated into the macroporous cellulose acetate substrate to form the composite membrane. The resulting membrane is subsequently inorganically modified via an in situ surface reaction of zinc nitrate with excess ammonium hydroxide to produce the hydrophilic and positively charged membrane. Crosslinking enhances the polymer interaction with the carbon nanotube interlayer which in turn endows it with mechanical strength and sustains the membrane pore structure during pressure driven filtration. The functionalized membrane displays outstanding pure water flux of 16.5 ± 1.3 L m⁻² h⁻¹ bar⁻¹ while exhibiting good nanofiltration performance of bivalent cations, which is ascribed to the electrostatic repulsion via the Donnan exclusion effect. Meanwhile the membranes exhibit excellent separation of organic molecules and long-term filtration stability. This newly developed approach presents a promising route for the construction of highly permeable nanofiltration membranes for fast purification and separation applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3aammonium hydroxide 3aasymmetric membranes 3acarbon nanotubes 3acarboxylation 3acations 3acellulose acetate 3acrosslinking 3aelectrostatic interactions 3ahydrophilicity 3ananocomposites 3ananofiltration 3anitrates 3apolyethyleneimine 3aporous media 3astrength (mechanics) 3azinc1 aZhang, Qiugen1 aGao, Runsheng1 aQu, Yan1 aLv, Ruixue1 aChen, Mengmeng1 aZhu, Aimei1 aLiu, Qinglin0 tJournal of materials chemistry A.g2017 Jan. 3, v. 5, no. 2 p.583-592dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26903x2050-74967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c6ta07567c3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03121naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024004200113040001800155100002200173242008700195245008700282300001600369520141000385592002801795650001201823650001501835650001901850650002601869650001501895650001101910650001201921650001301933650002601946650002601972650001701998650002502015650001702040650001202057650001202069650003802081650001402119650001902133650003302152650002502185650001102210650001702221651002302238651001702261651001602278700001902294700002502313700001902338773012202357856005502479852000902534655001202543IND50075014920221116234805.0140410e200802  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007501492DNAL7 a182548582pmid7 a10.1111/j.1523-1739.2007.00801.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBERTNESS, MARK D.10aEutrophication and Consumer Control of New England Salt Marsh Primary Productivity10aEutrophication and Consumer Control of New England Salt Marsh Primary Productivity  ap. 131-139.  aAlthough primary productivity in salt marshes is thought to be controlled by physical forces, recent evidence suggests that human disturbances can drive a switch to consumer control in these ecologically valuable ecosystems. We tested the hypothesis that nitrogen enrichment can trigger consumer control in salt marshes in Narragansett Bay, Rhode Island, with (1) a field experiment in which we manipulated nutrient availability (with nutrient additions) and insect herbivory (with insecticide application), (2) a survey of 20 salt marshes that examined the relationship between marsh nutrient status and herbivore pressure, and (3) insect herbivore removal at high and low nutrient input sites to directly test the hypothesis that nutrient enrichment is increasing insect herbivory in these marshes. Experimental nitrogen eutrophication initially increased plant productivity but eventually led to reduced plant biomass due to insect herbivory, and our surveys revealed that marsh nitrogen supply was a good predictor of herbivore damage to plants. Insects had minimal impacts on primary productivity in pristine marshes, but suppressed primary productivity in eutrophic salt marshes by 50–75%. Thus, eutrophication is currently triggering consumer suppression of primary productivity in New England salt marshes and may ultimately jeopardize the ecological and societal services these systems provide.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiomass 3aecosystems 3aeutrophication 3afield experimentation 3aherbivores 3ahumans 3ainsects 3anitrogen 3anutrient availability 3apesticide application 3aplant damage 3aprimary productivity 3asalt marshes 3asurveys 2aAnimals 2aConservation of Natural Resources 2aEcosystem 2aEutrophication 2aFeeding Behaviorxphysiology 2aInsectaxphysiology. 2aPlants 2aTime Factors 3aNew England region 3aRhode Island 0aNew England1 aCRAIN, CAITLIN1 aHOLDREDGE, CHRISTINE1 aSALA, NICHOLAS0 tConservation biology.g2008 Feb., v. 22, no. 1 p.131-139dBlackwell Publishing IncwJournal:jnl42603x0888-88927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1523-1739.2007.00801.x  aDNAL 7aarticle02088naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002100140245009500161300001400256520078100270592002801051650004801079650004201127650002501169650000801194650001701202650001301219650001301232650001801245650001101263650001301274650001001287650001901297650001201316650001301328650001501341650002201356650002601378650001401404700002001418700002201438773012001460856004101580852000901621655001201630IND50061734220221116231033.0130320e200301  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006173422DNAL7 a10.1007/BF032631552doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTamota, Bhaju K.10aRegulation of Expression of the prb-1b / ACC Deaminase Gene by UV-8 in Transgenic Tomatoes  ap. 25-29.  aTransgenic tomato plants with 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC) deaminase gene from Enterobacter cloacae UW4 under the control of a pathogenesis-related promoter (prb-1b) from tobacco were challenged by abiotic stresses to determine the expression patterns ofthe transgene.

The microstructure and chemical composition of the coatings were characterized by SEM, EDS, XPS and XRD. The growth characteristics of the MAO coatings on different matrix regions were analyzed. The corrosion and wear resistance of the coatings were evaluated through the immersion test, electrochemical measurements and friction test. Results showed that the MAO coatings consisted primarily of Mg₂SiO₄, MgO, little amount of MgAl₂O₄ and amorphous SiO₂. The current density influenced the thickness and structure via affecting the voltage response of the MAO process, afterward influencing the properties of the coatings. The termination voltage of the MAO process and thickness of the coatings increased with the current density. With the current density increased from 8 to 160 mA/cm², the compactness and microhardness of the coatings were increased, thereby improving the corrosion and wear resistance of the coatings. However, as the current density increased to 200 mA/cm², the generation of large through-cracks caused the friction coefficient to increase and the corrosion resistance to deteriorate.  aPublisher supplied data  aZR2019MEM020cNatural Science Foundation of Shandong Province  aZR2017LEM004cNatural Science Foundation of Shandong Province  aYCX2020083cGraduate Innovation Fund of China University of Petroleum (East China)  a2021C039-5cProject of Jilin Province Development and Reform Commission 3aalloys 3achemical composition 3acorrosion 3aelectric potential difference 3aelectrochemistry 3afriction 3aglass 3aliquids 3amicroparticles 3amicrostructure 3aoxidation1 aYu, Sirong1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7439-17511 aZhu, Guang1 aLi, Quan1 aLiu, Enyang1 aXiong, Wei1 aWang, Bingying1 aYang, Xizhen0 tJournal of materials science.g2021 Sept., v. 56, no. 27 p.15379-15396dSpringer USwJournal:jnl4392857x0022-24617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10853-021-06252-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02770naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100001700154245007900171300001600250520149300266592002801759650001501787650001301802650001101815650002901826650002101855650003101876650001501907650001601922650001101938650000701949650001901956650001701975650001101992650000902003650002102012700002802033700003002061700002502091700002802116773011602144856005502260852000902315655001202324IND50065184520221121002059.0130416e201210  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006518452DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-2389.2012.01481.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aParadelo, M.10aCoupled transport of humic acids and copper through saturated porous media  ap. 708-716.  aThe mechanism of mediated transport of copper (Cu) by humic acids (HA) in pore water was studied taking account of colloid filtration theory and by means of breakthrough experiments of HA in water‐saturated columns filled with quartz sand. The influence of pH and Cu²⁺ concentration on Cu–HA binding and retention of Cu–HA complexes in the matrix were analysed with colloid‐surface attachment models. Experiments were performed for differing Cu concentrations (0–20 mg l⁻¹) and pH (5–7). Copper binding to HA increased with pH and Cu²⁺ addition, according to ion–humic complexation theory. The zeta potential of the HA became less negative with increasing amounts of Cu, which led to less electrostatic repulsion and an increase in the retention of the HA in the column. A kinetic colloid transport model with a random sequential adsorption (RSA) blocking function was well fitted to the experimental breakthrough curves (BTCs). The model accounted for heterogeneity in the adsorption sites in the quartz sand for all of the electrochemical conditions. For pH = 7, the transport of Cu was coupled with the HA, while at pH = 5, the transport occurred mostly as free Cu²⁺. Models of the influence of dissolved soil organic matter and electrochemical conditions on the fate of trace elements in the soil may contribute to a quantitative exploration of strategies for soil remediation and disposal of contaminated soil containing excessive amounts of trace elements.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3acolloids 3acopper 3adissolved organic matter 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrostatic interactions 3afiltration 3ahumic acids 3amodels 3apH 3apolluted soils 3aporous media 3aquartz 3asand 3asoil remediation1 aPérez‐Rodríguez, P.1 aFernández‐Calviño, D.1 aArias‐Estévez, M.1 aLópez‐Periago, J.

This evolution can be analyzed considering the variations over time of the lateral stress at rest coefficient K0. This paper is focused on the evolution of the K0 in overconsolidated clay deposits submitted to the incision of natural slopes. The proposed idea is that, under specific morphological and evolutionary conditions, a value of K0<1 could be considered reliable even for medium–high OC clay deposits. This idea is here discussed with the support of in-situ and laboratory data from: i) pressuremeter tests performed in overconsolidated clay deposits in Central Italy and ii) a scaled physical modeling experiment reproducing a normally consolidated clay deposit. This study suggests that when dealing with clay deposits subjected to a simultaneous vertical and horizontal unloading due to slope incision, the K0 coefficient should be considered a parameter variable as a function of the different stress–strain evolutions experienced by each portion of the deposit. The portions involved in the slope incision had different evolutions and are represented by different K0 values. As a consequence, diverse amounts of decrease distinguish the evolution of the K0 for natural rather than artificial slopes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclay 3aengineering 3ageology 3aItaly 0aLateral stress coefficient 0aOverconsolidated clays 0aPressuremeter tests 0aPhysical modeling1 aBretschneider, Alberto1 aMartino, Salvatore1 aPrestininzi, Alberto0 tEngineering geology.g2014 Feb. 04, v. 169 p.69-79dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12441x0013-79527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enggeo.2013.11.0133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04111naa a2200829 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002800111040001800139100002100157245005300178300001600231500001500247520163400262592002801896650001001924650001201934650001101946650001501957650001801972650001901990650001102009650001002020650002002030650001702050650001302067650001102080650002202091650001102113650001702124650000902141650001002150650001902160650001102179650003702190650002002227650001402247650000902261650001302270650002602283650002202309650003002331650003602361650002502397650001202422650002302434650001902457650006102476650001302537650002602550650004902576650001602625650004502641650002702686650003302713650005402746650005302800650005302853650002402906650004002930650002202970653001602992700001603008700002203024700002303046773011303069856007803182852000903260655001203269IND4465427020221119013050.0120501e201201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446542702DNAL7 a220164292pmid7 a10.1093/jxb/err3172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWilkinson, Sally10aHow is ozone pollution reducing our food supply?  ap. 527-536.  a2019-12-06  aGround-level ozone pollution is already decreasing global crop yields (from ∼2.2–5.5% for maize to 3.9–15% and 8.5–14% for wheat and soybean, respectively), to differing extents depending on genotype and environmental conditions, and this problem is predicted to escalate given climate change and increasing ozone precursor emissions in many areas. Here a summary is provided of how ozone pollution affects yield in a variety of crops, thus impacting global food security. Ozone causes visible injury symptoms to foliage; it induces early senescence and abscission of leaves; it can reduce stomatal aperture and thereby carbon uptake, and/or directly reduce photosynthetic carbon fixation; it can moderate biomass growth via carbon availability or more directly; it can decrease translocation of fixed carbon to edible plant parts (grains, fruits, pods, roots) due either to reduced availability at source, redirection to synthesis of chemical protectants, or reduced transport capabilities via phloem; decreased carbon transport to roots reduces nutrient and water uptake and affects anchorage; ozone can moderate or bring forward flowering and induce pollen sterility; it induces ovule and/or grain abortion; and finally it reduces the ability of some genotypes to withstand other stresses such as drought, high vapour pressure deficit, and high photon flux density via effects on stomatal control. This latter point is emphasized here, given predictions that atmospheric conditions conducive to drought formation that also give rise to intense precursor emission events will become more severe over the coming decades.  aPublisher supplied data 3awheat 3adrought 3acarbon 3acrop yield 3afood security 3avapor pressure 3apollen 3aroots 3anutrient uptake 3awater stress 3agenotype 3aleaves 3astomatal movement 3aovules 3aCalvin cycle 3acorn 3aozone 3aclimate change 3aphloem 3agenotype-environment interaction 3aleaf abscission 3aemissions 3apods 3asoybeans 3aenvironmental factors 3afood availability 2aAbscisic Acidxmetabolism 2aAir Pollutantsxadverse effects 2aBiological Transport 2aBiomass 2aCarbonxmetabolism 2aClimate Change 2aCrops, Agriculturalxdrug effectsxgrowth & development. 2aDroughts 2aEthylenesxmetabolism 2aFlowersxdrug effectsxgrowth & development. 2aFood Supply 2aOxidants, Photochemicalxadverse effects 2aOzonexadverse effects 2aPhotosynthesisxdrug effects 2aPlant Leavesxdrug effectsxgrowth & development. 2aPlant Rootsxdrug effectsxgrowth & development. 2aPlant Stemsxdrug effectsxgrowth & development. 2aPlant Transpiration 2aStress, Physiologicalxdrug effects 2aWaterxmetabolism 0afood supply1 aMills, Gina1 aIllidge, Rosemary1 aDavies, William J.0 tJournal of experimental botany.g2012 Jan., v. 63, no. 2 p.527-536dOxford University Pressx0022-09577nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jxb/err3173Available from publisher's Web site  aDNAL 7aarticle02557naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002100144245014200165300001800307500002000325520115100345592002801496650001301524650001401537650001601551650004301567650001301610650002201623650002301645650001701668650002401685650001101709700001701720700001701737700001701754700002101771700002101792700002201813700001301835700001801848773013301866856007801999961001302077852000902090655001202099IND60589144820221119193219.0180202e201704  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058914482DNAL7 a10.1002/jssc.2016013102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYoung, Joshua E.10aPhenolic composition of pomegranate peel extracts using an liquid chromatography‐mass spectrometry approach with silica hydride columns  ap. 1449-1456.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe peels of different pomegranate cultivars (Molla Nepes, Parfianka, Purple Heart, Wonderful and Vkunsyi) were compared in terms of phenolic composition and total phenolics. Analyses were performed on two silica hydride based stationary phases: phenyl and undecanoic acid columns. Quantitation was accomplished by developing a liquid chromatography with mass spectrometry approach for separating different phenolic analytes, initially in the form of reference standards and then with pomegranate extracts. The high‐performance liquid chromatography columns used in the separations had the ability to retain a wide polarity range of phenolic analytes, as well as offering beneficial secondary selectivity mechanisms for resolving the isobaric compounds, catechin and epicatechin. The Vkunsyi peel extract had the highest concentration of phenolics (as determined by liquid chromatography with mass spectrometry) and was the only cultivar to contain the important compound punicalagin. The liquid chromatography with mass spectrometry data were compared to the standard total phenolics content as determined by using the Folin–Ciocalteu assay.  aPublisher supplied data 3acatechin 3acultivars 3aepicatechin 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3ahydrides 3amass spectrometry 3aphenolic compounds 3apomegranates 3areference standards 3asilica1 aPan, Zhongli1 aTeh, Hui Ean1 aMenon, Veena1 aModereger, Brent1 aPesek, Joseph J.1 aMatyska, Maria T.1 aDao, Lan1 aTakeoka, Gary0 tJournal of separation science.g2017 Apr., v. 40, no. 7 p.1449-1456dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3924049x1615-93067nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jssc.2016013103Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/ARS  aDNAL 7aarticle02543naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001600139245015000155300001800305500002000323520125200343592002801595650002901623650001601652650001001668650002501678650002601703650002301729650002001752650002301772650001401795650001201809650001601821700001701837700001301854700001401867700001801881700001801899773012201917856007302039852000902112655001202121IND60587848820221119192813.0180102e201703  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058784882DNAL7 a10.1111/are.129712doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHu, Shuixin10aEffects of dietary DHA/EPA ratios on growth performance, survival and fatty acid composition of juvenile swimming crab (Portunus trituberculatus)  ap. 1291-1301.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThis study was conducted to investigate the effects of dietary docosahexaenoic to eicosapentaenoic acid (DHA/EPA) ratios on growth performance, survival and fatty acid composition of juvenile swimming crab (Portunus trituberculatus). Four isonitrogenous and isoenergetic experimental diets were formulated to contain different DHA/EPA ratios (0.70, 0.84, 1.06 and 1.25). There were three replicates (15 crabs per replicate) for each diet treatment. The crabs were fed (about 6–8% body weight) twice daily for 8 weeks. A good growth performance and feed utilization were observed in swimming crabs fed the diets with DHA/EPA ratios of 0.70 and 0.84. Crabs fed diet with 0.70 DHA/EPA ratio showed a significantly higher weight gain (WG) compared with the crabs fed the diet with DHA/EPA ratio of 1.25 (P < 0.05). The result of this study showed that the survival increased with decreasing the ratio of DHA/EPA. The DHA/EPA ratios in polar lipid from tissues were influenced by the dietary DHA/EPA ratios. Results of this study indicated that the growth performance and survival of juvenile swimming crab are correlated to the DHA/EPA ratio in the diets, and the best growth performance and survival were achieved with the ratios of 0.70–0.84.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPortunus trituberculatus 3abody weight 3acrabs 3adocosahexaenoic acid 3aeicosapentaenoic acid 3aexperimental diets 3afeed conversion 3agrowth performance 3ajuveniles 3atissues 3aweight gain1 aWang, Jiteng1 aHan, Tao1 aLi, Xinyu1 aJiang, Yudong1 aWang, Chunlin0 tAquaculture research.g2017 Mar., v. 48, no. 3 p.1291-1301dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl53865x1355-557X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/are.129713Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02451naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002600150245016300176300001400339520111500353592002801468650001501496650001601511650001401527650002201541650001301563650001301576650002101589650001701610651000901627653002201636653001501658653001501673653002001688653001901708653002401727700002101751700002701772700002301799773010201822856008401924852000902008655001202017IND60599076820221123042442.0180702e20140204xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059907682DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enggeo.2013.11.0142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKhanlari, Gholam-Reza10aQuantification of strength anisotropy of metamorphic rocks of the Hamedan province, Iran, as determined from cylindrical punch, point load and Brazilian tests  ap. 80-90.  aIn this research, different experimental techniques have been used to determine the strength of five types of anisotropic foliated rocks, selected from different parts of the Hamedan Province, west of Iran. For this purpose, after sample preparation and assessment of mineralogical and physical properties, selected samples were subjected to Cylindrical Punch, Point Load and Brazilian tests and their strengths were evaluated with respect to different angles, beta (i.e. β=0°, 15°, 30°, 45°, 60°, 75° and 90°), between anisotropy planes and the major loading directions. Data analyses show that the types and amounts of minerals have an influence on the physical and mechanical properties of the tested anisotropic rocks. Porosity and water absorption also have a dominant control on the mechanical indices such as cylindrical punch index (CPI), point load index (Is(50)) and Brazilian tensile strength (BTS). On the basis of the test result, two empirical equations (Eqs. (3) and (5)) are proposed for calculating CPI and Is(50). Other empirical equations relating studied indices are also presented.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanisotropy 3aengineering 3aequations 3ametamorphic rocks 3aminerals 3aporosity 3atensile strength 3awater uptake 3aIran 0aMetamorphic rocks 0aAnisotropy 0aPunch test 0aPoint load test 0aBrazilian test 0aEmpirical equations1 aHeidari, Mojtaba1 aSepahigero, Ali-Asghar1 aFereidooni, Davood0 tEngineering geology.g2014 Feb. 04, v. 169 p.80-90dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12441x0013-79527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enggeo.2013.11.0143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03537naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001400150245012300164300001600287520201500303592002802318650001502346650002402361650002102385650001102406650001302417650001702430650001102447650002502458650001502483650001802498650001202516650002302528650000702551650001902558650001402577653001702591653003202608653001602640653001502656653001802671653002302689700002102712700001802733700001202751700001902763700001102782773012102793856008402914852000902998655001203007IND60122376620221120200222.0150325e20150304xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012237662DNAL7 a10.1080/03601234.2015.9824322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYe, Yulin10aEvaluation of anaerobic co-digestion of dairy manure with food wastes via bio-methane potential assay and CSTR reactor  ap. 217-227.  aThe introduction of food wastes into anaerobic digestion (AD) brings a promising scenario of increasing feedstock availability and overall energy production from AD. This study evaluated the biodegradability and methane potential from co-digestion of two typical food wastes, kitchen waste and chicken fat, with dairy manure. For single substrate, the bio-methane potential assays showed that kitchen waste had the highest methane yield of 352 L-CH ₄ kg –¹-VS added, 92% more than dairy manure alone. Chicken fat at the same Volatile Solid (VS) level (2 g L –¹) inhibited bio-methane production. Addition of kitchen waste and chicken fat to a VS percentage of up to 40% improved overall methane yield by 44% and 34%, respectively. Synergistic effect was observed when either combining two or three substrates as AD feedstock, possibly as a result of increased biodegradability of organic materials in chicken fat and kitchen waste compared with dairy manure. Addition of chicken fat improved methane yield more than kitchen waste. However, addition of chicken fat VS over 0.8 g L –¹ should be cautiously done because it may cause reactor failure due to decrease in pH. The maximum methane yield was 425 L-CH ₄ kg –¹-VS, achieved at a VS ratio of 2:2:1 for kitchen waste, chicken fat, and dairy manure. Results from batch AD experiment demonstrated that supplementing dairy manure to chicken fat and/or kitchen waste improved alkalinity of substrate due to the inclusion of more titratable bases in dairy manure, and therefore stabilized the methanogenesis and substantially improved biogas yield. A mixture of substrates of kitchen waste, chicken fat, and dairy manure at a ratio of 1:1:3 was fed to a continuously stirred tank reactor operated at organic loading rates of 3.28, 6.55, and 2.18 g-COD L –¹-day (hydraulic retention time of 20, 10, and 30 days, respectively) under mesophilic condition, and methane production rate reached 0.65, 0.95, and 0.34 L-CH ₄ L –¹-reactor-day.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalkalinity 3aanaerobic digestion 3abiodegradability 3abiogas 3achickens 3adairy manure 3aenergy 3aenvironmental health 3afeedstocks 3akitchen waste 3amethane 3amethane production 3apH 3apoultry manure 3asynergism 0aCo-digestion 0abio-methane potential (BMP) 0achicken fat 0afood waste 0akitchen waste 0asynergistic effect1 aZamalloa, Carlos1 aLin, Hongjian1 aYan, Mi1 aSchmidt, David1 aHu, Bo0 tJournal of environmental science and health.g2015 Mar. 4, v. 50, no. 3 p.217-227dTaylor & Francisx1532-41097nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/03601234.2015.9824323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02453naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002200092024001900114024003100133040001800164100002300182245009200205300001600297506007600313520112200389592002801511506003701539650002601576650002401602650001201626650002501638650002901663650002201692650001701714650001901731650002101750650003101771650001701802700002001819773011701839852000901956856007801965655001202043IND4439568420221207080229.0200426e20100201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443956842DNAL7 aPMC28841342pmcid7 a201734132pmid7 a10.4161/psb.5.2.111072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKakizaki, Tomohiro10aNew insights into the retrograde signaling pathway between the plastids and the nucleus  ap. 196-199.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aIn plant cells, the genetic information required for biological activity is divided into 3 organelles—the nucleus, plastids, and mitochondria. These organelles require tightly coordinated gene expression to accomplish the appropriate biological processes. Chloroplasts harness light energy and use it for carbon fixation in photosynthesis. However, majority of the proteins involved in photosynthesis is encoded by the nucleus genome. Thus, nuclear-encoded photosynthesis-related proteins are targeted to plastids after their synthesis in the cytosol. Therefore, it is critical to regulate nuclear gene expression in response to the functional or metabolic state of the plastids; this process relies on signals from the plastids to the nucleus that are known as retrograde signals. Our genetic studies revealed that GENOMES UNCOUPLED 1 (GUN1) and Golden2-like1 (GLK1) mediate the retrograde signal that coordinates plastid protein import and nuclear gene expression. In this study, we propose a novel signaling pathway that regulates nuclear gene expression according to the rate of protein import into the plastid.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3anet assimilation rate 3asignal transduction 3acytosol 3abiochemical pathways 3atranscription (genetics) 3aprotein transport 3acell nucleus 3aphotosynthesis 3aplant physiology 3agene expression regulation 3achloroplasts1 aInaba, Takehito0 tPlant signaling & behavior.g2010 Feb. 1, v. 5, no. 2 p.196-199dTaylor & FranciswJournal:2184x1559-23247nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.4161/psb.5.2.111073Available from publisher's site 7aarticle02744naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002100144245013500165300001800300500002000318520128800338592002801626650001601654650001501670650002201685650001601707650001601723650002101739650001501760650002001775650001701795650001201812650001301824650001401837650001101851650000701862650001601869650001301885650002701898650001601925650001701941700002101958700001901979700003201998773013302030856007802163852000902241655001202250IND60589144920221119193309.0180202e201704  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058914492DNAL7 a10.1002/jssc.2016009572doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZdolšek, Nikola10aSolid‐phase extraction disk based on multiwalled carbon nanotubes for the enrichment of targeted pesticides from aqueous samples  ap. 1564-1571.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aA sensitive method for the determination of six varying polarity pesticides (imidacloprid, acetamiprid, carbendazim, simazine, linuron, and tebufenozide) based on a solid‐phase extraction disk with multiwalled nanotubes is proposed.A dispersion of multiwalled nanotubes in a surfactant aqueous solution (Triton X‐100) was used for the preparation of the solid‐phase extraction disk. The effect of surfactant on the functional groups of multiwalled nanotubes was examined by applying temperature‐programmed desorption. It was found that this treatment increased the amount of oxygen groups of treated multiwalled nanotubes comparing with untreated ones. The factors that may influence the adsorption and recovery such as the kind and volume of eluent, volume, flow rate and pH of sample were investigated and optimized. Under the optimized conditions, the maximal enrichment factors for low polar pesticides are ranging from 4000 to 4985 and for more polar are 2250 and 2750. The linear range of calibration curves was 10–500 ng/L with correlation coefficient higher than 0.9960, and the detection limit was 6.2–23.7 ng/L. Finally optimized method was applied for determination trace level of five out of six pesticides in tap and river water samples with good recovery.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetamiprid 3aadsorption 3aaqueous solutions 3acalibration 3acarbendazim 3acarbon nanotubes 3adesorption 3adetection limit 3aimidacloprid 3alinuron 3amoieties 3aoctoxynol 3aoxygen 3apH 3ariver water 3asimazine 3asolid phase extraction 3asurfactants 3atebufenozide1 aKumrić, Ksenija1 aKalijadis, Ana1 aTrtić‐Petrović, Tatjana0 tJournal of separation science.g2017 Apr., v. 40, no. 7 p.1564-1571dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3924049x1615-93067nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jssc.2016009573Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01840naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001900152245008800171300001600259520073600275592002801011650001401039650001601053650001101069650001301080650001001093650002301103653001701126653001301143653001401156653002301170700001101193700001501204700001801219773013301237856008701370852000901457655001201466IND60605284920221120124728.0200110e201809  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060528492DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2018.04.1762doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAhmed, Shakeel12aA review on chitosan centred scaffolds and their applications in tissue engineering  ap. 849-862.  aThe diversity and availability of biopolymer and increased clinical demand for safe scaffolds lead to an increased interest in fabricating scaffolds in order to achieve fruitful progress in tissue engineering. Chitosan is a biopolymer obtained by de-acetylation of chitin extracted from shells of crustaceans and fungi. Due to the presence of reactive functionality in the molecular chain chitosan can be modified either chemically or physically to fabricate the tailor-made scaffolds having desired properties for tissue engineering centred applications.

Coatings with 0.15% (m/v) GG + 0.1% (m/v) calcium chloride + 0.1% (m/v) glycerol + 1% (m/v) GSE presented the best characteristics to uniformly coat sweet cherry surface. Quality (weight loss, decay percentage, firmness), respiration rate, nutrient components (total soluble solids, titratable acid, ascorbic acid, total phenols, anthocyanins) and malondialdehyde evaluations were performed. Coatings with GG-GSE controlled water loss and delayed loss of firmness and of titratable acid, ascorbic acid and total phenols, compared with untreated fruit. Overall, coatings developed in this study extend sweet cherries’ shelf life for about 8 days, demonstrating for the first time that the combination of guar gum and ginseng extract as edible coating materials has great potential in expanding the shelf life of fruits.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPanax 3aPrunus avium 3aanthocyanins 3aascorbic acid 3acalcium chloride 3acell respiration 3acoatings 3aedible films 3afirmness 3afruits 3aglycerol 3aguar gum 3amalondialdehyde 3ashelf life 3atitratable acidity 3atotal soluble solids 3aweight loss 0aGuar gum 0aGinseng extract 0aCoatings 0aSweet cherry1 aWang, Xiaolin0 tLebensmittel-Wissenschaft + Technologie.g2018 Mar., v. 89 p.117-122dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl1644x0023-64387nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lwt.2017.10.0353Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03520naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100006600138245012100204300001400325500002000339520163500359592002801994596008502022596008502107596008502192596007702277596007702354650001802431650001202449650002402461650001702485650001502502650001502517650001602532650001902548650001702567650001702584650001802601650001902619650001902638650001402657650001402671650001102685700006902696700006202765773010502827856007302932852000903005655001203014IND60768603820221118034139.0220225e202201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076860382DNAL7 a10.1002/yea.36672doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBizarria, Rodolfo, Jr.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4293-588610aYeasts in the attine ant–fungus mutualism: Diversity, functional roles, and putative biotechnological applications  ap. 25-39.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aInsects interact with a wide variety of yeasts, often providing a suitable substrate for their growth. Some yeast–insect interactions are tractable models for understanding the relationships between the symbionts. Attine ants are prominent insects in the Neotropics and have performed an ancient fungiculture of mutualistic basidiomycete fungi for more than 55–65 million years. Yeasts gain access to this sophisticated mutualism, prompting diversity, ecological, and biotechnological studies in this environment. We review half a century research in this field, surveying for recurrent yeast taxa and their putative ecological roles in this environment. We found that previous studies mainly covered the yeast diversity from a small fraction of attine ants, being Saccharomycetales, Tremellales, and Trichosporonales as the most frequent yeast or yeast‐like orders found. Apiotrichum, Aureobasidium, Candida, Cutaneotrichosporon, Debaryomyces, Meyerozyma, Papiliotrema, Rhodotorula, Trichomonascus, and Trichosporon are the most frequent recovered genera. On the other hand, studies of yeasts’ ecological roles on attine ant–fungus mutualism only tapped the tip of the iceberg. Previous established hypotheses in the literature cover the production of lignocellulosic enzymes, chemical detoxification, and fungus garden protection. Some of these roles have parallels in biotechnological processes. In conclusion, the attine ant environment has a hidden potential for studying yeast biodiversity, ecology, and biotechnology, which has been particularly unexplored considering the vast diversity of fungus‐growing ants.  aPublisher supplied data  a142396/2019‐2cConselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico  a305269/2018‐6cConselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico  a305341/2015‐4cConselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico  a2019/03746‐0cFundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado de São Paulo  a2019/24412‐2cFundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado de São Paulo 3aAureobasidium 3aCandida 3aCutaneotrichosporon 3aDebaryomyces 3aMeyerozyma 3aNeotropics 3aRhodotorula 3aTrichomonascus 3aTrichosporon 3abiodiversity 3abiotechnology 3afungus gardens 3alignocellulose 3amutualism 3asymbionts 3ayeasts1 aPagnocca, Fernando Carlos1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5026-19331 aRodrigues, André,1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4164-93620 tYeast.g2022 Jan., v. 39, no. 1-2 p.25-39dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl39201x0749-503X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/yea.36673Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03580naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001100153245012100164506011700285506007600402520208400478592002802562506003702590650001502627650002002642650001802662650001602680650001702696653001602713653001202729653001902741653002702760653001702787700001802804700001502822700001602837700001902853700001602872700001302888700001702901773011902918856008803037852000903125655001203134IND60767774320221207092205.0220517e20220615xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076777432DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.1538622doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Qi10aSpeciation of heavy metals in soils and their immobilization at micro-scale interfaces among diverse soil components  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aHeavy metal (HM) pollution of soils is a globally important ecological and environmental problem. Previous studies have focused on i) tracking pollution sources in HM-contaminated soils, ii) exploring the adsorption capacity and distribution of HMs, and iii) assessing phyto-uptake of HMs and their ecotoxicity. However, few reviews have systematically summarized HM pollution in soil-plant systems over the past decade. Understanding the mechanisms of interaction between HMs and solid soil components is consequently key to effectively controlling and remediating HM pollution. However, the compositions of solid soil phases are diverse, their structures are complex, and their spatial arrangements are heterogeneous, all leading to the formation of soil micro-domains that exhibit different particle sizes and surface properties. The various soil components and their interactions ultimately control the speciation, transformation, and bioavailability of HMs in soils. Over the past few decades, the extensive application of advanced instrumental techniques and methods has greatly expanded our understanding of the behavior of HMs in organic mineral assemblages. In this review, studies investigating the immobilization of HMs by minerals, organic compounds, microorganisms, and their associated complexes are summarized, with a particular emphasis on the interfacial adsorption and immobilization of HMs. In addition, methods for analyzing the speciation and distribution of HMs in aggregates of natural soils with different particle sizes are also discussed. Moreover, we also review the methods for speciating HMs at mineral-organic micro-scale interfaces. Lastly, developmental prospects for HM research at inorganic-organic interfaces are outlined. In future research, the most advanced methods should be used to characterize the interfaces and in situ characteristics of metals and metal complexes. In particular, the roles and contributions of microorganisms in the immobilization of HMs at complex mineral-organic interfaces require significant further investigation.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aadsorption 3abioavailability 3aecotoxicology 3aenvironment 3aheavy metals 0aHeavy metal 0aMineral 0aOrganic carbon 0aInterface interactions 0aDistribution1 aWang, Yanhong1 aLi, Yichun1 aLi, Linfeng1 aTang, Mingdeng1 aHu, Weifang1 aChen, Li1 aAi, Shaoying0 tScience of the total environment.g2022 June 15, v. 825 p.153862-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.1538623Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03224naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100002000184245015800204300002000362500001500382506007600397520162600473592002802099506003702127650001802164650002402182650001102206650001702217650001502234650001402249650001202263650002002275650003102295650002602326650003502352650002502387650001402412653001602426700002202442700002302464773017502487856008302662852000902745655001202754IND4465042720221207100711.0120502e20111206xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446504272DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.11045981082doi7 aPMC32417862pmcid7 a221062562pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRolig, Annah S.10aBacterial chemotaxis modulates host cell apoptosis to establish a T-helper cell, type 17 (Th17)-dominant immune response in Helicobacter pylori infection  ap. 19749-19754.  a2019-12-06  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe host inflammatory response to chronic bacterial infections often dictates the disease outcome. In the case of the gastric pathogen Helicobacter pylori, host inflammatory responses result in outcomes that range from moderate and asymptomatic to more severe with concomitant ulcer or cancers. It was found recently that H. pylori chemotaxis mutants (Che–), which lack directed motility but colonize to nearly wild-type levels, trigger less host inflammation. We used these mutants to observe host immune responses that resulted in reduced disease states. Here we report that these mutants are defective for early gastric recruitment of CD4+ T cells compared with wild-type infection. Furthermore, Che– mutant infections lack the T-helper cell, type 17 (Th17) component of the immune response, as measured by cytokine mRNA levels in gastric tissue via intracellular cytokine staining and immunofluorescence. We additionally find that a Che– mutant infection results in significantly less host cell apoptosis than does wild-type infection, in accordance with previous observations that T-helper cell, type 17 responses in Citrobacter rodentium infections are driven by concomitant bacterial and apoptotic cell signals. We propose that bacterial chemotaxis allows H. pylori to access a particular host niche that allows the bacteria to express or deliver proapoptotic host cell factors. This report indicates that chemotaxis plays a role in enhancing apoptosis, suggesting bacterial chemotaxis systems might serve as therapeutic targets for infections whose symptoms arise from host cell apoptosis and tissue damage.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3amessenger RNA 3aHelicobacter pylori 3aniches 3ainflammation 3achemotaxis 3apathogens 3amutants 3aimmune response 3aCD4-positive T-lymphocytes 3aCitrobacter rodentium 3afluorescent antibody technique 3abacterial infections 3aapoptosis 0arecruitment1 aCarter, J.

However, the diversity of Brazilian environmental conditions could be of great advantage to adapting this sector to new climatic conditions, which should be assessed as in this study on shifting Arabica coffee cultivation to the extreme south of the country. The methodology applied is the same the one used to define climatic risks in current productive regions of Brazil and their vulnerability to climatic change predicted by IPCC reports. The basic climatic parameters applied were frost probability and annual average temperature, since annual water deficit did not prove to be a restricting factor for Arabica coffee cultivation in the study area. The climatic conditions suitable for coffee production are: annual average temperature between 18°C and 22°C, annual water deficit less than 100 mm and frost probability (risk of lowest annual temperature less than 1°C) less than 25%. An area is said to have “low climatic risks” for coffee production when these three climatic conditions are met. Current climatic conditions were used and simulations of four temperature increases between 1°C and 4°C were also performed. The results indicated a substantial increase in the size of low climatic risks areas for the production of Arabica coffee in the extreme south of Brazil, mainly for mean temperature increases of 3°C in the study area in relation to present conditions. Increases of 2°C and 4°C were also favorable, but not as good as those obtained for 3°C. It should be underscored that areas with low climatic risks will be able to be found mainly in the extreme south of the study region, the border with Uruguay and North of Argentina.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCoffea arabica 3aanthropogenic activities 3aclimate change 3aclimatic zones 3acrop production 3aenvironmental factors 3afrost 3arisk 3atemperature 3aArgentina 3aBrazil 3aUruguay1 aPinto, Hilton Silveira1 aAssad, Eduardo Delgado1 ade Ávila, Ana Maria Heuminski0 tClimatic change.g2011 Dec., v. 109, no. 3-4 p.535-548dSpringer-Verlagx0165-00097nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10584-011-0058-0  aDNAL 7aarticle02786naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002300147245015100170300001600321520135300337592002801690650003401718650001901752650002501771650001401796650001801810650001901828650002301847650001201870650001001882650001001892650001301902650001601915653002101931653001901952653001201971653002801983653002902011700002602040700003202066700001902098773012102117856008102238852000902319655001202328IND60584694220221119185329.0190318e201803  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058469422DNAL7 a10.1016/j.lwt.2017.10.0392doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAntoniewska, Agata10aAntioxidative, nutritional and sensory properties of muffins with buckwheat flakes and amaranth flour blend partially substituting for wheat flour  ap. 217-223.  aEffects of partial replacement (17–50%) of wheat flour (WF) with buckwheat flakes/amaranth flour blend (B-A) on quality attributes of muffins during storage, with special attention on their antioxidative, nutritional and sensory properties, were studied. Increasing the B-A content in muffins resulted in progressing antioxidative activity, e.g. 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl scavenging by 26–51%, as well as in increased mono- and polyunsaturated fatty acid (FA) contents; e.g., linolenic acid content was 0.34 g/100 g FA in control (C-muffins), and 0.53 g/100 g FA in the muffins with the highest WF substitution. Moreover, fibre content in that latter case was 2.5-fold higher than in C-muffins. The content of secondary lipid oxidation products did not exceed the upper safety limits in muffins with higher WF substitution of by B-A. Intensities of cereal, nut aroma and taste increased with increasing B-A content, but that of buttery aroma decreased. Intensities of off-aroma and of bitter taste were low in fresh muffins but increased with storage due to increased secondary lipid oxidation products. Higher WF replacement by B-A (33 or 50%) in muffins improved their nutritional and antioxidative properties, effectively inhibiting hydroperoxide decomposition, thus preventing generation of toxic secondary lipid oxidation products.  aPublisher supplied data 3a2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl 3aamaranth flour 3aantioxidant activity 3abuckwheat 3afiber content 3alinolenic acid 3alipid peroxidation 3amuffins 3aodors 3ataste 3atoxicity 3awheat flour 0aBuckwheat flakes 0aAmaranth flour 0aMuffins 0aAntioxidative potential 0aLipid oxidation products1 aRutkowska, Jarosława1 aPineda, Montserrat Martinez1 aAdamska, Agata0 tLebensmittel-Wissenschaft + Technologie.g2018 Mar., v. 89 p.217-223dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl1644x0023-64387nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lwt.2017.10.0393Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03092naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002400153245019200177300001600369520169200385592002802077650001302105650001002118650002602128650001702154650001802171650001302189650002202202650002102224650001502245650001402260650002302274651001002297653001902307653001702326653002802343653002102371653002602392653002402418773011902442856008802561852000902649655001202658IND60563786120221119095301.0201125e20161215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056378612DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2016.08.1662doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aUrbina, Mauricio A.10aTemporal variation on environmental variables and pollution indicators in marine sediments under sea Salmon farming cages in protected and exposed zones in the Chilean inland Southern Sea  ap. 841-853.  aThe impacts of any activity on marine ecosystems will depend on the characteristics of the receptor medium and its resilience to external pressures. Salmon farming industry develops along a constant gradient of hydrodynamic conditions in the south of Chile. However, the influence of the hydrodynamic characteristics (weak or strong) on the impacts of intensive salmon farming is still poorly understood. This one year study evaluates the impacts of salmon farming on the marine sediments of both protected and exposed marine zones differing in their hydrodynamic characteristics. Six physico-chemical, five biological variables and seven indexes of marine sediments status were evaluated under the salmon farming cages and control sites. Our results identified a few key variables and indexes necessary to accurately evaluate the salmon farming impacts on both protected and exposed zones. Interestingly, the ranking of importance of the variables and the temporality of the observed changes, varied depending on the hydrodynamic characteristics. Biological variables (nematodes abundance) and environmental indexes (Simpson's dominance, Shannon's diversity and Pielou evenness) are the first to reflect detrimental impacts under the salmon farming cages. Then the physico-chemical variables such as redox, sulphurs and phosphorus in both zones also show detrimental impacts. Based on the present results we propose that the hydrodynamic regime is an important driver of the magnitude and temporality of the effects of salmon farming on marine sediments. The variables and indexes that best reflect the effects of salmon farming, in both protected and exposed zones, are also described.  aPublisher supplied data 3aNematoda 3acages 3aenvironmental factors 3afish culture 3ahydrodynamics 3aindustry 3amarine ecosystems 3amarine sediments 3aphosphorus 3apollution 3atemporal variation 3aChile 0aSalmon farming 0aFish farming 0aHydrodynamic conditions 0aMarine sediments 0aEnvironmental impacts 0aAquaculture impacts0 tScience of the total environment.g2016 Dec. 15, v. 573 p.841-853dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2016.08.1663Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02027naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245012100158300002000279520094500299592002801244650001301272650000901285650001701294650000901311650001301320650001601333650001301349650001901362650002201381650002301403650001501426700001601441773012501457856007401582852000901656655001201665IND60666949520221118193352.0190919e20141103xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066694952DNAL7 a10.1039/c4ra10785c2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHou, Xianming10aControllable fabrication and photocatalysis of ZnO/Au nanohybrids via regenerative ion exchange and reduction cycles  ap. 56945-56951.  aA facile and convenient approach was introduced to fabricate ZnO/Au nanohybrids with tunable Au contents. The repeated loading of Au nanoparticles on the surface of ZnO nanorods was achieved via 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane-mediated regenerative exchange of AuCl₄⁻ ions and subsequent reduction cycles. X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, and transmission electron microscopy were all used to characterize as-prepared ZnO/Au nanohybrids. The attachment of Au nanoparticles onto the ZnO supports significantly altered the interfacial charge transfer process and resulted in a marked decrease in the intensity of photoluminescence peaks. Owing to their special geometry, electronic structure, and particular interphase boundaries, such ZnO/Au nanohybrids exhibited enhanced photocatalytic performance, and hold promising applications in water purification and antibacterial products.  aPublisher supplied data 3ageometry 3agold 3aion exchange 3aions 3ananogold 3ananohybrids 3ananorods 3aphotocatalysis 3aphotoluminescence 3awater purification 3azinc oxide1 aWang, Lixia0 tRSC advances.g2014 Nov. 03, v. 4, no. 100 p.56945-56951dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c4ra10785c3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02767naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001300151245007900164506011700243506007600360520115800436592002801594506003701622650002701659650001901686650001401705650001301719650000901732650001101741650001101752650001501763651001001778653003801788653001901826653002901845653002601874653002501900700001901925700001801944700001501962700001201977700002001989700001902009700002002028700001702048773010102065856008602166852000902252655001202261IND60764049120221207113220.0220606e202203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076404912DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecolind.2022.1085842doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Yuan10aAnthropogenic activities accelerated the evolution of river trophic status  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aEutrophication has become one of the most serious problems facing water environments. Exploring the relationship between anthropogenic activities and river trophic status provides effective information for environmental improvement and restoration, whilst the relationship remains poorly understood. Herein, 5225 water samples were collected monthly from 12 tributaries covered upstream in the Three Gorges Reservoir, China during 2014–2020. Quantitative anthropogenic activities based on land-use covers were used to establish correlations with tributary trophic status in small-scale watershed. The results showed that tributary trophic status had significant spatio-temporal variations and was the highest in summer, especially in July and August. Quantitative anthropogenic activities can explain well the eutrophic frequency and eutrophication risk in tributaries. Furthermore, it was proved that anthropogenic activities could accelerate the evolution of trophic status. Our findings increased the understanding of the interrelationship between humans and the environment and can provide practical strategies for river environmental restoration.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aecological restoration 3aeutrophication 3aevolution 3aland use 3arisk 3arivers 3asummer 3awatersheds 3aChina 0aComprehensive trophic level index 0aEutrophication 0aHuman activity intensity 0aLand-use cover change 0aThree Gorges Project1 aFang, Lingchao1 aYuanzhu, Wang1 aMi, Wujuan1 aLi, Ji,1 aGuixiang, Zhang1 aYang, Pingheng1 aChen, Zhongbing1 aBi, Yonghong0 tEcological indicators.g2022 Mar., v. 136 p.108584-dElsevier LtdwJournal:6196x1470-160X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2022.1085843Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02934naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002700147245011900174300001600293520121200309592002801521650002601549650002701575650001501602650002901617650001201646650003901658650001901697650001801716650001901734650004101753650001601794650003701810650001101847650003301858650002001891650001701911650001001928650001401938653001801952653001201970653002901982653002702011653002002038700007002058700001902128700001802147700001602165773012102181856008102302852000902383655001202392IND60584694520221119185616.0190318e201803  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058469452DNAL7 a10.1016/j.lwt.2017.10.0422doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSadekuzzaman, Mohammad10aActivity of thyme and tea tree essential oils against selected foodborne pathogens in biofilms on abiotic surfaces  ap. 134-139.  aOwing to their preservative and antimicrobial effects, essential oils (EOs) are promising natural ingredients for the food industry. The main objective of this study was to investigate the activity of thyme and tea tree oils against selected foodborne pathogens in biofilm mode. The major compounds of these EOs were analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and their antimicrobial activity was determined by a standard broth dilution assay. Biofilms were formed by Escherichia coli O157:H7, Listeria monocytogenes, and Salmonella spp. on abiotic surfaces and were treated with EOs at the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and 0.1% (v/v) for 2 h. Our results demonstrate that EO treatment reduced biofilm cells up to 3.5 log CFU/cm2, 2.1 log CFU/cm2, and 2.5 log CFU/peg on stainless steel (SS), rubber, and minimum biofilm eradication concentration (MBEC™) surfaces, respectively. Structural changes of the biofilm after exposure to EOs was confirmed by field-emission scanning electron microscopy and viability of biofilm cells was observed using a confocal laser scanning microscope. Overall, these results suggest that EOs could be used to reduce foodborne pathogens in biofilms.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli O157 3aListeria monocytogenes 3aSalmonella 3aantimicrobial properties 3abiofilm 3aconfocal laser scanning microscopy 3aessential oils 3afood industry 3afood pathogens 3agas chromatography-mass spectrometry 3aingredients 3aminimum inhibitory concentration 3arubber 3ascanning electron microscopy 3astainless steel 3atea tree oil 3athyme 3aviability 0aEssential oil 0aBiofilm 0aEscherichia coli O157:H7 0aListeria monocytogenes 0aSalmonella spp.1 aMizan, Md Furkanur Rahaman1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1819-38271 aKim, Hyung-Suk1 aYang, Sungdae1 aHa, Sang-Do0 tLebensmittel-Wissenschaft + Technologie.g2018 Mar., v. 89 p.134-139dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl1644x0023-64387nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lwt.2017.10.0423Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02765naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002200148245016800170506011700338506007600455520103100531592002801562506003701590650002101627650003001648650001401678650001101692650002201703650001301725650000901738650001201747650001401759650001101773650001901784650001201803650001601815650000901831653002301840653002401863653001901887653002101906653001201927700001701939700001801956700002001974700001601994700001902010773011402029856008302143852000902226655001202235IND60764093320221207112606.0220606e202205  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076409332DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecmx.2022.1001842doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKhanh, Tran Quoc,10aHighly selective hydrodeoxygenation of wood pallet sawdust pyrolysis oil to methyl phenol derivatives using cobalt and iron on activated carbon supported catalysts  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe catalytic hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) processes for upgrading pyrolysis bio-oils from wood pallet sawdust (WPS) were studied using activated carbon (AC) as a support of mono- (Co/AC and Fe/AC) and bi-metallic (Co-Fe/AC) catalysts. The effects of the reaction temperature and hydrogen pressure on products and high heating value (HHV) were systematically investigated. At 350 °C and 60 bar, 20 wt% Co/AC showed the highest liquid yield (70.46 wt%) along with HHV of 34.22 MJ/Kg. Among the tested bimetallic catalysts, comparable liquid yield (68.85 wt%) and HHV (34.16 MJ/kg) were achieved with 20 wt% 4Co-1Fe/AC catalyst. Methyl phenol derivatives were found to be the main component in upgraded bio-oil. The carbon number of the upgraded bio-oil was mainly distributed in C₅–C₁₁ fraction, especially with the C₈ component (20.40 wt%). The catalysts were deactivated by the formation of carbonaceous compounds on the external surface, oxidation of metal species, and blocking of active sites on catalysts.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aactivated carbon 3aadministrative management 3acatalysts 3acobalt 3aenergy conversion 3ahydrogen 3airon 3aliquids 3aoxidation 3aphenol 3apyrolysis oils 3asawdust 3atemperature 3awood 0aHydrodeoxygenation 0aWood pallet sawdust 0aCo-Fe catalyst 0aActivated carbon 0aBio-oil1 aVu Ly, Hoang1 aAnh Vo, Thuan1 aTae Hwang, Hyun1 aKim, Jinsoo1 aKim, Seung-Soo0 tEnergy conversion and management: X.g2022 May, v. 14 p.100184-dElsevier LtdwJournal:27489x2590-17457nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecmx.2022.1001843Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02884naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245010100163300001600264520144500280592002801725650002701753650002401780650001801804650003101822650001401853650002101867650001301888650001401901650002001915650001401935650002001949650001801969650001201987650001401999650001202013650001502025653001302040653001402053653001102067653001102078653001302089700002102102700006002123773011702183856008102300852000902381655001202390IND60686783120221116235149.0200318e202003  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068678312DNAL7 a10.1017/S00311820190015502doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOno, Masaya10aBacterial feeding nematodes ingest haemocytes in the haemocoel of the insect Galleria mellonella  ap. 279-286.  aInsect parasitic nematodes have acquired mechanisms to evade their host immune response for successful parasitism. Despite the importance of understanding of the evolution of evasion mechanisms from host immunity, insect immune response against non-parasitic nematodes has not been well studied. In our previous study, we demonstrated that a non-insect parasitic nematode Caenorhabditis elegans was not encapsulated by haemocytes in the larvae of the greater wax moth Galleria mellonella. To understand how nematodes influence insect haemocytes to escape encapsulation, we examined the effect of C. elegans on haemocytes in the haemocoel of G. mellonella larvae. Injection of nematodes resulted in the decrease of haemocyte density while mortality and spreading ability of haemocytes, the haematopoietic organs were not affected. In vitro co-incubation of haemocytes with nematodes resulted in a decrease of haemocyte density and we observed feeding on haemocytes by nematodes. Injection of C. elegans feeding-delay mutants into insects did not cause the decrease of haemocyte density. The decrease of haemocyte density was due to the nematode's ingestion of haemocytes. Furthermore, an entomopathogenic nematode and other bacterial feeding nematodes also showed similar feeding behaviour. The nematode's ability to feed on haemocytes may have played an important role in the evolution of nematode parasitism in bacterial-feeding nematodes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCaenorhabditis elegans 3aGalleria mellonella 3aencapsulation 3aentomopathogenic nematodes 3aevolution 3afeeding behavior 3ahemocoel 3ahemocytes 3aimmune response 3aingestion 3ainsect immunity 3ainsect larvae 3ainsects 3amortality 3amutants 3aparasitism 0acellular 0ahaemocyte 0aimmune 0ainsect 0anematode1 aHayakawa, Yoichi1 aYoshiga, Toyoshi1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7050-26180 tParasitology.g2020 Mar., v. 147, no. 3 p.279-286dCambridge University PresswJournal:jnl45572x1469-81617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S00311820190015503Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02975naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001600150245015800166300001600324520152100340592002801861650001901889650002001908650002301928650002501951650003801976650001902014650001002033650004102043650001702084650000902101650001502110650001702125650002602142650001202168651001102180653002902191653001302220653002402233653002702257700001902284773012102303856008402424852000902508655001202517IND60122377220221120200140.0150325e20150403xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012237722DNAL7 a10.1080/03601234.2015.9996012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSun, Rui Y.13aAn indirect competitive biotin-streptavidin enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for the determination of dimethyl phthalate (DMP) in milk and milk products  ap. 275-284.  aAfter the “plasticizer event” in Taiwan, phthalic acid esters (PAEs) have been listed in “Inedible materials possibly added into food illegally” and “Commonly abused food additives.” As one of the PAEs family, DMP has long been a problem of great concern due to its potential impacts on human health. In order to detect DMP with high sensitivity and specificity, a sensitive indirect competitive biotin-streptavidin enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (BA-ELISA) has been established in this study. A high-titer rabbit polyclonal antibody (pAb-DMP) targeting DMP was obtained, and the procedures of BA-ELISA were optimized for the determination of DMP in milk and milk products. Under optimal conditions, good linearity was achieved within a range of 0.024 to 6.027 μg L ⁻¹, with low cross-reactivity values for DMP structural analogues (lower than 10%). The median inhibitory concentration (IC ₅₀) was 0.356 μg L ⁻¹ and the limit of detection (LOD) was 0.0082 μg L ⁻¹. Finally, the concentrations of DMP in milk and milk products ranged from 1.03 μg kg ⁻¹ to 7.23 μg kg ⁻¹ by BA-ELISA. Satisfactory recoveries (90.26–112.38%) and coefficient of variation (CV) values (5.08–8.46%) were obtained. These results were consistent with those using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), which further confirmed that the proposed BA-ELISA was accurate, specific, reliable and rapid for routine monitoring trace DMP residues in foodstuff, especially milk and milk products.  aPublisher supplied data 3across reaction 3adetection limit 3adimethyl phthalate 3aenvironmental health 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3afood additives 3afoods 3agas chromatography-mass spectrometry 3ahuman health 3amilk 3amonitoring 3aplasticizers 3apolyclonal antibodies 3arabbits 3aTaiwan 0aDimethyl phthalate (DMP) 0aBA-ELISA 0apolyclonal antibody 0amilk and milk products1 aZhuang, Hui S.0 tJournal of environmental science and health.g2015 Apr. 3, v. 50, no. 4 p.275-284dTaylor & Francisx1532-41097nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/03601234.2015.9996013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01961naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245008600166300001600252520072000268592002800988650001201016650002201028650002001050650001101070650001401081650001501095650001401110650002101124653001701145653001301162653001301175653002201188653002501210700002101235700001701256700007101273773011701344856008101461852000901542655001201551IND60686783220221116234740.0200318e202003  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068678322DNAL7 a10.1017/S00311820190015622doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBurrell, Alana10aLife cycle stages, specific organelles and invasion mechanisms of Eimeria species  ap. 263-278.  aApicomplexans, including species of Eimeria, pose a real threat to the health and wellbeing of animals and humans.

The purpose of this study was to develop and validate a feasible clinical assay to quantify serum hARG, arginine (ARG), asymmetric (ADMA) and symmetric dimethylarginines (SDMA) levels by LC–MS/MS and investigate their differences at different stages of pregnancy with or without preeclampsia. Serum samples were collected from 84 pregnant women without complications (controls), 84 with mild preeclampsia (MPE), and 81 with severe preeclampsia (SPE) at various gestation stages (before the 20th week, during the 20th–28th week or after the 28th week of gestation). No significant difference in ARG levels was observed between PE and controls at any stage (P > 0.05). The serum hARG levels and hARG/ADMA ratios of MPE before the 20th week were higher than those of controls (P < 0.001). ADMA levels of MPE were higher than those of controls during the 20th–28th week (P < 0.01). SDMA levels of SPE were higher than those of MPE (P < 0.01) and controls (P < 0.05) after the 28th week. Elevated serum hARG before the 20th week was identified as an independent predictor for PE (OR = 1.478, 95% CI 1.120–1.950). ROC curve analysis showed serum hARG before the 20th week had a good potential to predict MPE (AUC = 0.875, 95% CI 0.759–0.948). In conclusion, our study indicated that elevated serum hARG and dimethylarginine levels detected by LC–MS/MS might serve as potential biomarkers for the early prediction of PE.  aPublisher supplied data  a19-E-35cShanghai Baoshan District Medical and Health Project Fund  aZK2019B28cShanghai Medical Key Specialty 3aarginine 3abiomarkers 3abiosynthesis 3ablood serum 3anitric oxide 3apre-eclampsia 3aprediction 3apregnancy1 aCai, Leiming1 aHu, Fengmei1 aXie, Li1 aChen, Xiong1 aWu, Ching-Ching,1 aLi, Qian1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6427-37830 tAmino acids.g2022 Aug., v. 54, no. 8 p.1215-1227dSpringer ViennawJournal:jnl52832x0939-44517nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00726-022-03177-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02824naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001800153245009900171520130200270592002801572650002201600650002101622650001801643650001901661650001601680650001901696650001301715650002101728650001501749650002001764650002101784650002001805650001501825650002501840653002101865653002001886653001401906653002101920653002001941653001901961700002001980700001802000700001902018700001602037700001702053700002002070773011902090856008802209852000902297655001202306IND60767775020221120132608.0220816e20220610xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076777502DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.1538692doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNassar, Lobna10aDevelopment of green polylactic acid asymmetric ultrafiltration membranes for nutrient removal  aPolylactides are a prominent class of biocompatible and biodegradable polymers that can be used to fabricate membranes for wastewater treatment. Excessive nutrient (phosphorus and nitrogen) concentrations in water bodies are a serious concern that has resulted in widespread health problems and potable water shortages. In this study, ultrafiltration (UF) membranes were prepared from polylactic acid (PLA) using the phase inversion method. Scanning electron microscope (SEM), thermogravimetric analyzer (TGA), and Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) analysis were used to characterize the membranes. The hydrophilicity of the membrane surface was investigated by analyzing the water contact angle (CA). The results showed that the PLA membranes had a finger-like asymmetric morphology and various dense pore sizes. When the concentration of the PLA polymer increased from 15% to 20%, the removal of ammonium‑nitrogen (NH₄⁺-N) increased from 41.9 ± 1.3% to 95.9 ± 3.1% and from 50% to 87% for synthetic and raw wastewater samples, respectively. Up to 52% removal rates of phosphates (PO₄³⁻-P) were achieved using PLA membranes. This study revealed a great opportunity to develop green, efficient, and sustainable PLA membranes for the treatment of wastewater with high nutrient content.  aPublisher supplied data 3aammonium nitrogen 3abiodegradability 3acontact angle 3adrinking water 3aenvironment 3ahydrophilicity 3anitrogen 3anutrient content 3aphosphorus 3apolylactic acid 3athermogravimetry 3aultrafiltration 3awastewater 3awastewater treatment 0aBiodegradability 0aPolylactic acid 0aMembranes 0aNutrient removal 0aPhase inversion 0aRaw wastewater1 aHegab, Hanaa M.1 aKhalil, Hiyam1 aWadi, Vijay S.1 aNaddeo, V.,1 aBanat, Fawzi1 aHasan, Shadi W.0 tScience of the total environment.g2022 June 10, v. 824 p.153869-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.1538693Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03440naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100006700150245015600217300001400373520180700387592002802194653001402222653000702236653001402243653002802257653000902285700007102294700002802365700002802393700007802421700002802499700006402527700005902591700006202650700007202712700006102784773010302845856008502948852000903033655001203042IND60764093620221119192521.0220205s2022    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076409362DNAL7 a10.1016/j.crimmu.2021.12.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPadovani, Barbara Nunes1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1186-848110aDifferent wild type strains of zebrafish show divergent susceptibility to TNBS-induced intestinal inflammation displaying distinct immune cell profiles  ap. 13-22.  aLittle is known about the diversity in immune profile of the different wild type strains of zebrafish (Danio rerio), despite its growing popularity as an animal model to study human diseases and drug testing. In the case of data resulting from modeling human diseases, differences in the background Danio fishes have rarely been taken into consideration when interpreting results and this is potentially problematic, as many studies not even mention the source and strain of the animals. In this study, we hypothesized that different wild type zebrafish strains could present distinct immune traits. To address the differences in immune responses between two commonly used wild type strains of zebrafish, AB and Tübingen (TU), we used an intestinal inflammation model induced by 2,4,6-Trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid (TNBS) and characterized the susceptibility and immune profile in these two strains. Our data demonstrates significant differences in survival between AB and TU strains when exposed to TNBS, suggesting important physiological differences in how these strains respond to inflammatory challenges. We observed that the AB strain presented increased mortality, higher neutrophilic intestinal infiltration, decreased goblet cell numbers and decreased IL-10 expression when exposed to TNBS, compared to the TU strain. In summary, our study demonstrates strain-specific immunological responses in AB and TU animals. Finally, the significant variations in strain-related susceptibility to inflammation and the differences in the immune profile shown here, highlight that the background of each strain need to be considered when utilizing zebrafish to model diseases and for drug screening purposes, thus better immune characterization of the diverse wild type strains of zebrafish is imperative.  aPublisher supplied data 0aZebrafish 0aAB 0aTübingen 0aIntestinal inflammation 0aTNBS1 aAbrantes do Amaral, Mariana1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4625-83281 aFénero, Camila Morales1 aParedes, Lais Cavalieri1 aBoturra de Barros, Guilherme José1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2285-60991 aXavier, Izabella Karina1 aHiyane, Meire Ioshie1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1380-58711 aGhirotto, Bruno1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6835-33291 aFeijóo, Carmen G.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1128-403X1 aSaraiva Câmara, Niels Olsen1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5436-12481 aTakiishi, Tatiana1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2112-809X0 tCurrent research in immunology.g2022, v. 3 p.13-22dElsevier B.V.wJournal:27496x2590-25557nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.crimmu.2021.12.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02922naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094024002200127024001900149040001800168100001600186245004300202300001800245506007600263520121800339592002801557506003701585650002501622650001501647650001101662650001601673650001401689650001101703650001301714650004201727650003001769650001501799653002701814653002501841653001901866653002701885653001201912700002101924700001601945700001001961700001901971700001401990700001902004700002002023700001802043700002102061700001302082773017302095856007902268852000902347655001202356IND60178501220221207085612.0150604e20130129xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6017850122DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.12203491102doi7 aPMC35627982pmcid7 a233078122pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKim, Jaebum10aReference-assisted chromosome assembly  ap. 1785-1790.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aOne of the most difficult problems in modern genomics is the assembly of full-length chromosomes using next generation sequencing (NGS) data. To address this problem, we developed “reference-assisted chromosome assembly” (RACA), an algorithm to reliably order and orient sequence scaffolds generated by NGS and assemblers into longer chromosomal fragments using comparative genome information and paired-end reads. Evaluation of results using simulated and real genome assemblies indicates that our approach can substantially improve genomes generated by a wide variety of de novo assemblers if a good reference assembly of a closely related species and outgroup genomes are available. We used RACA to reconstruct 60 Tibetan antelope (Pantholops hodgsonii) chromosome fragments from 1,434 SOAPdenovo sequence scaffolds, of which 16 chromosome fragments were homologous to complete cattle chromosomes. Experimental validation by PCR showed that predictions made by RACA are highly accurate. Our results indicate that RACA will significantly facilitate the study of chromosome evolution and genome rearrangements for the large number of genomes being sequenced by NGS that do not have a genetic or physical map.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aPantholops hodgsonii 3aalgorithms 3acattle 3achromosomes 3aevolution 3agenome 3agenomics 3ahigh-throughput nucleotide sequencing 3apolymerase chain reaction 3aprediction 0acomputational genomics 0acomparative genomics 0abioinformatics 0achromosome breakpoints 0amammals1 aLarkin, Denis M.1 aCai, Qingle1 aAsan,1 aZhang, Yongfen1 aGe, Ri-Li1 aAuvil, Loretta1 aCapitanu, Boris1 aZhang, Guojie1 aLewin, Harris A.1 aMa, Jian0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2013 Jan. 29, v. 110, no. 5 p.1785-1790dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.12203491103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02392naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002000144245007700164300001800241500002000259520113300279592002801412650004401440650001501484650002201499650001301521650001501534650002401549650002601573650001101599650003301610650002301643650001701666700001801683700002201701700002101723700001801744773013301762856007801895852000901973655001201982IND60589145620221119193503.0180202e201704  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058914562DNAL7 a10.1002/jssc.2016009922doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDemirci, Binnaz10aProtein C recognition by ion‐coordinated imprinted monolithic cryogels  ap. 1610-1620.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe protein C imprinted monolithic cryogel was synthesized using 2‐hydroxyethyl methacrylate by redox cryo‐polymerization method. The prepared monolithic cryogel was characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, swelling test, surface area measurements, and scanning electron microscopy. The nonimprinted cryogel was prepared as well for control. Adsorption of protein C from aqueous solutions was investigated in a continuous mode and several parameters affecting adsorption performance were optimized. The maximum protein C adsorption amount was 30.4 mg/g. The selectivity studies were performed by monolithic column studies and fast protein liquid chromatography, using hemoglobin and human serum albumin as competing proteins. The relative selectivity coefficients were 2.37 and 8.89 for hemoglobin and human serum albumin, respectively. Reusability was tested for ten consecutive adsorption–desorption cycles, and no significant change in adsorption capacity was recorded. A pseudo‐second‐order model was suitable to interpret kinetic data, and the Langmuir model suited the adsorption isotherms well.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aadsorption 3aaqueous solutions 3acryogels 3ahemoglobin 3ahuman serum albumin 3aliquid chromatography 3amodels 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asorption isotherms 3asurface area1 aBereli, Nilay1 aAslıyüce, Sevgi1 aBaydemir, Gözde1 aDenizli, Adil0 tJournal of separation science.g2017 Apr., v. 40, no. 7 p.1610-1620dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3924049x1615-93067nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jssc.2016009923Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02926naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001900139245011300158300001800271500002000289520157000309592002801879650002401907650002501931650001601956650001601972650000901988650001201997650002002009650002502029650001502054650002002069650002602089650001202115650001602127650002602143650001202169650002502181650001602206700002002222700002202242773012202264856007302386852000902459655001202468IND60587849620221119193257.0180102e201703  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058784962DNAL7 a10.1111/are.129512doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Xiao‐qin10aCitric acid substituted the inclusion of inorganic phosphorus in diet of rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss)  ap. 1089-1098.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThis study was conducted to evaluate the effects of citric acid (CA) supplementation in diet without inorganic phosphorus (P) on growth, muscle and bone composition, proteolytic activities and serum antioxidant property of rainbow trout. Six diets were designed as the negative diet without monocalcium phosphate (MCP) supplementation, the positive diet containing 10 g kg⁻¹ MCP and CA supplementation diets with 4, 8, 12, 16 g kg⁻¹ CA supplementation in negative diet, and then were fed to rainbow trout (113.6 g) for 60 days. Results showed that the fish fed 8 g kg⁻¹ CA, 12 g kg⁻¹ CA diet had higher weight gain, higher contents of crude ash and P in bone, and lower feed conversion ratio than those of fish fed negative diet (P < 0.05), and showed the similar levels as those of fish fed positive diet (P > 0.05). The proximate composition and P level of muscle were not affected by dietary CA and MCP. The proteolytic activity in intestine, but not in stomach and gastric digesta, was significantly improved by dietary CA and MCP (P < 0.05), when compared with negative control. The activities of serum superoxide dismutase of 12 g kg⁻¹ CA and 10 g kg⁻¹ MCP groups were significantly higher, and the malondialdehyde of 8 g kg⁻¹ CA and 12 CA g kg⁻¹ groups were significantly lower than those of negative control (P < 0.05). The above results indicated that the supplementation of CA could substitute the inclusion of MCP in rainbow trout diet and the supplementation level was suggested to be 8–12 g kg⁻¹.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOncorhynchus mykiss 3aantioxidant activity 3ablood serum 3acitric acid 3adiet 3adigesta 3afeed conversion 3ainorganic phosphorus 3aintestines 3amalondialdehyde 3amonocalcium phosphate 3amuscles 3aproteolysis 3aproximate composition 3astomach 3asuperoxide dismutase 3aweight gain1 aCui, Weid‐ong1 aLeng, Xiang‐jun0 tAquaculture research.g2017 Mar., v. 48, no. 3 p.1089-1098dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl53865x1355-557X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/are.129513Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02392naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002100150245011300171300001400284520123300298592002801531650001601559650001601575650001201591650001101603650000901614650001501623650002701638650001801665653003101683653002901714653002101743653001201764653001801776700001701794773010201811856008401913852000901997655001202006IND60599077920221120121744.0180702e20140220xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059907792DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enggeo.2013.12.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSasahara, Katsuo10aDevelopment of shear deformation due to the increase of pore pressure in a sandy model slope during rainfall  ap. 43-51.  aTo examine the relationship between the increase of the shear strain and the volumetric water content, the suction, and the pore pressure in a slope under rainfall, an analysis of the measurement of the soil–water and the deformation of the sandy model slope due to rainfall infiltration is conducted. At first, the surface displacement of the slope mostly occurs due to the increase of the pore pressure. The surface displacement increases slightly under unsaturated conditions at first and later increases significantly with the increase of the pore pressure. The surface displacement increases slightly immediately after the generation of the pore pressure at first, and the ratio of the increase of the surface displacement to the increase of the pore pressure subsequently grows larger. The shear strain in the soil layer of the model slope also increases to a small amount with the increase of the volumetric water content or the decrease of the suction in unsaturated conditions at first and later increases significantly with the increment of the positive pore pressure. The relationship between the shear strain and the positive pore pressure is hyperbolic, and the maximum pore pressure is greater at a deeper layer.  aPublisher supplied data 3adeformation 3aengineering 3ageology 3amodels 3arain 3asoil water 3aunsaturated conditions 3awater content 0aRainfall-induced landslide 0aStress–strain relation 0aUnsaturated soil 0aSuction 0aPore pressure1 aSakai, Naoki0 tEngineering geology.g2014 Feb. 20, v. 170 p.43-51dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12441x0013-79527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enggeo.2013.12.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02795naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001700140245011300157300001800270520158200288592002801870650002301898650002801921650002201949650002201971650001001993650000702003650001902010650001602029650002102045650003702066650001502103650002502118700001702143700001502160700001802175773012102193856007402314852000902388655001202397IND60666950120221118193738.0190919e20141204xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066695012DNAL7 a10.1039/c4ra10797g2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Shanping10aDegradation of 2,4-dichlorophenol in wastewater by low temperature plasma coupled with TiO₂ photocatalysis  ap. 1902-1909.  aDegradation of 2,4-dichlorophenol (2,4-DCP) in wastewater was conducted in a dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) reactor coupled with TiO₂ photocatalysis. The main advantage of the system is that ultraviolet (UV) light produced by the DBD and reactive species like ozone (O₃) can be used for the treatment of wastewater. In this study, the effect of discharge voltage, initial concentration and initial pH on the degradation of 2,4-DCP was studied. TiO₂ and I–TiO₂ were introduced to enhance the removal efficiency of 2,4-DCP. We also investigated the effect of adding tert-butanol to probe the role of hydroxyl radicals in the reaction. The results indicated that 2,4-DCP could be removed effectively and hydroxyl radicals played an important role during the degradation process by the low temperature plasma. The removal efficiency of 2,4-DCP with I–TiO₂ was better than with TiO₂. The degradation efficiency with 10% I–TiO₂ was 89.59% after 120 min when the discharge voltage was 75 V, pH 5.32 and 50 mg L⁻¹ was selected as the initial concentration. The removal efficiency of 2,4-DCP decreased with the increasing concentration of tert-butanol because alcohols are excellent radical scavengers that inhibit the generation of hydroxyl radicals during the DBD process. The degradation products of 2,4-DCP were characterized qualitatively and quantitatively using Mass spectrometry and UV-Vis spectroscopy. Besides, the degradation mechanism, the degradation pathway and the structures of intermediate products were also examined and discussed in detail.  aPublisher supplied data 3a2,4-dichlorophenol 3afree radical scavengers 3ahydroxyl radicals 3amass spectrometry 3aozone 3apH 3aphotocatalysis 3atemperature 3atitanium dioxide 3aultraviolet-visible spectroscopy 3awastewater 3awastewater treatment1 aMa, Xiaolong1 aLiu, Lijun1 aCao, Xiaohong0 tRSC advances.g2014 Dec. 04, v. 5, no. 3 p.1902-1909dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c4ra10797g3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03848naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001600149245015600165300001300321506011700334506007600451520195800527592002802485506003702513650004402550650002202594650001702616650002802633650002202661650001602683650001302699650002902712650001102741650001902752650002802771650001902799650001502818650000902833650001802842650001402860653003002874653001502904653001402919653002802933653002102961653002702982700001703009700001303026700001703039700001503056773011803071856008403189852000903273655001203282IND60764093720221207101542.0220326e202203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076409372DNAL7 a10.1016/j.gaost.2022.01.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Jing14aThe impact of high hydrostatic pressure treatment time on the structure, gelatinization and thermal properties and in vitro digestibility of oat starch  ap. 1-12.  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aAs a non-thermal processing technology, high hydrostatic pressure (HHP) can be used for starch modification without affecting the quality and flavour constituents. The effect of HHP on starch is closely related to the treatment time of HHP. In this paper, we investigated the impacts of HHP treatment time (0, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30 min) on the microstructure, gelatinization and thermal properties as well as in vitro digestibility of oat starch by scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, ¹³C NMR and differential scanning calorimeter. Results showed that 5-min HHP treatment led to deformation and decreases in short-range ordered and double-helix structures of oat starch granules, and further extending the treatment time to 15 min or above caused the formation of a gelatinous connection zone, increase of particle size, disintegration of short-range ordered and double-helix structures, and crystal structure change from A type to V type, indicating gelatinization occurred. Longer treatment time also resulted in the reduction in both the viscosity and the stability of oat starch. These indicated that HHP treatment time greatly influenced the microstructure of oat starch, and the oat starch experienced crystalline destruction (5 min), crystalline disintegration (15 min) and gelatinization (> 15 min) during HHP treatment. Results of in vitro digestibility showed that the rapidly digestible starch (RDS) content declined first after treatment for 5 to 10 min then rose with the time extending from 15 to 30 min, indicating that longer pressure treatment time was unfavourable to the health benefits of oat starch for humans with diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Therefore, the 500-MPa treatment time for oat starch is recommended not more than 15 min. This study provides theoretical guidance for the application of HHP technology in starch modification and development of health foods.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aX-ray diffraction 3acalorimeters 3acardiovascular diseases 3acrystal structure 3adeformation 3adiabetes 3adigestible carbohydrates 3aflavor 3agelatinization 3ahigh pressure treatment 3amicrostructure 3aoat starch 3aoils 3aparticle size 3aviscosity 0aHigh hydrostatic pressure 0aOat starch 0aStructure 0aGelatinization property 0aThermal property 0aIn vitro digestibility1 aZhang, Meili1 aBai, Xue1 aZhang, Yakun1 aWang, Chen0 tGrain & oil science and technology.g2022 Mar., v. 5, no. 1 p.1-12dElsevier B.V.wJournal:27281x2590-25987nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gaost.2022.01.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02670naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001600140245011100156300002000267520134200287592002801629650001901657650001101676650001901687650001401706650002301720650001101743650001901754650001901773650001001792650001301802650001801815650001401833650001101847650002001858650001601878700001501894700001601909700001501925700001701940700001701957700001801974773012501992856007402117852000902191655001202200IND60666950220221118193734.0190919e20141110xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066695022DNAL7 a10.1039/c4ra10798e2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFang, Deren10aCatalytic hydrodechlorination of 4-chlorophenol over a series of Pd–Cu/γ-Al₂O₃ bimetallic catalysts  ap. 59204-59210.  aA series of Pd–Cu/γ-Al₂O₃ bimetallic catalysts was prepared using the sequentially incipient wetness impregnation method. The catalysts were characterized using X-ray diffraction, temperature programmed reduction, scanning electron microscopy-energy dispersive X-ray, and hydrogen (H₂) pulse chemisorption measurements. The influence of Cu on the Pd–Cu/γ-Al₂O₃ bimetallic catalyst in the catalytic hydrodechlorination (HDC) of 4-chlorophenol (4-CP) in an aqueous phase in a mixing glass tank reactor was studied using H₂ as the reducing agent. Compared with a Pd/γ-Al₂O₃ monometallic catalyst, adding Cu to modify the Pd catalyst changed the dispersion of Pd particles and surface area of the metals, thereby significantly influencing the catalytic performance in the HDC of 4-CP in an aqueous phase. The results demonstrated that adding Cu to the Pd catalyst improved the dispersion of Pd particles and increased the HDC catalytic activity when the Cu/Pd molar ratio was ≤0.5/1. In addition, the formation of a Pd–Cu alloy in the Pd–Cu bimetallic catalyst inhibited further hydrogenation of phenol, the hydrodechlorinated product of 4-CP. The Cu/γ-Al₂O₃ catalyst had an extremely low catalytic activity in the HDC of 4-CP; however, it did not catalyze the hydrogenation of phenol to form cyclohexanone.  aPublisher supplied data 3a4-chlorophenol 3aalloys 3aaluminum oxide 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3acopper 3acyclohexanones 3adechlorination 3aglass 3ahydrogen 3ahydrogenation 3apalladium 3aphenol 3areducing agents 3atemperature1 aLi, Wanjun1 aZhao, Jinbo1 aLiu, Shang1 aMa, Xuanxuan1 aXu, Jinguang1 aXia, Chuanhai0 tRSC advances.g2014 Nov. 10, v. 4, no. 103 p.59204-59210dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c4ra10798e3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02693naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002000144245018000164300001800344500002000362520136800382592002801750650002301778650001301801650002201814650001901836650001701855650001401872650001301886650001401899650001401913650002301927650001001950650001101960700001601971700002201987700002102009700002102030773013302051856007802184852000902262655001202271IND60589145920221119193509.0180202e201704  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058914592DNAL7 a10.1002/jssc.2016010772doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStrangl, Miriam10aCharacterization of odorous contaminants in post‐consumer plastic packaging waste using multidimensional gas chromatographic separation coupled with olfactometric resolution  ap. 1500-1507.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe increasing world population with their growing consumption of goods escalates the issue of sustainability concepts with increasing demands in recycling technologies. Recovery of post‐consumer packaging waste is a major topic in this respect. However, contamination with odorous constituents currently curtails the production of recycling products that meet the high expectations of both consumers and industry. To guarantee odor‐free recyclates, the main prerequisite is to characterize the molecular composition of the causative odorants in post‐consumer plastic packaging waste. However, targeted characterization of odorous trace contaminants among an abundance of volatiles is a major challenge and requires specialized and high‐resolution analytical approaches. For this aim, post‐consumer packaging waste was characterized by sensory analysis and two‐dimensional high resolution gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry and olfactometry. The 33 identified odorants represent various structural classes as well as a great diversity of smell impressions with some of the compounds being identified in plastics for the first time. Substances unraveled within this study provide insights into sources of odorous contamination that will require specific attention in the future in terms of screening and prevention in recycling products.  aPublisher supplied data 3agas chromatography 3aindustry 3amass spectrometry 3aodor compounds 3aolfactometry 3apackaging 3aplastics 3arecycling 3ascreening 3asensory evaluation 3asmell 3awastes1 aFell, Tanja1 aSchlummer, Martin1 aMaeurer, Andreas1 aBuettner, Andrea0 tJournal of separation science.g2017 Apr., v. 40, no. 7 p.1500-1507dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3924049x1615-93067nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jssc.2016010773Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02654naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002300140245013200163300002000295520140300315592002801718650002201746650002801768650002601796650002801822650002501850650001401875650001101889650001901900650001301919650001501932650001601947650002501963700002001988700002402008700001702032773012402049856007402173852000902247655001202256IND60666950420221118193438.0190919e20150130xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066695042DNAL7 a10.1039/c4ra10800k2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKumar, K.

A high dielectric constant of GO (∼10⁶) with low loss was observed at 1 kHz and at 30 °C, which is even very high compared to conventional dielectric materials such as CaCu₃Ti₄O₁₂. The conductivity of our GO was calculated and found to be 3.980 × 10⁻⁵ to 1.943 × 10⁻⁵ (DC) and 2.0 × 10⁻³ to 1.7 × 10⁻² (AC). The various conducting mechanisms governing the conductivity (AC and DC) of GO with varying frequency and temperature are assessed using impedance spectroscopy. The mechanistic approach and the role of functional groups, defects, temperature and frequency are elucidated and discussed with regard to the high dielectric constant. The variation of activation energy from 1.15 (1 kHz) to 0.58 (2.0 MHz) is related to the frequency dependent conductivity of the π–π conjugated electrons and their hopping has also been discussed. The present dielectric results are superior to those of GOL (with fewer defects/less sonication time). Moreover, the present findings suggest that the new GO can be used for scaling advances high performance electronic devices and high dielectric-based electronic and energy storage devices.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactivation energy 3adielectric permittivity 3adielectric properties 3adielectric spectroscopy 3aelectronic equipment 3aelectrons 3aenergy 3agraphene oxide 3amoieties 3asonication 3atemperature 3aultrasonic treatment1 aPittala, Suresh1 aSanyadanam, Srinath1 aPaik, Pradip0 tRSC advances.g2015 Jan. 30, v. 5, no. 19 p.14768-14779dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c4ra10800k3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03546naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245014600165300001600311520187200327592002802199650001802227650001802245650001902263650001702282650001302299650002902312650001102341650001802352650001602370650000902386650001202395650001102407650001402418650001502432650001902447650002302466650002202489650002202511650001902533653001902552653001102571653001502582653001602597653001902613653001402632653001902646653002102665653002202686700002302708700002402731773012102755856008302876852000902959655001202968IND60559904620221118043438.0180904e201702  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055990462DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cbpa.2016.11.0162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBolin, Greta10aIncubation relative humidity induces renal morphological and physiological remodeling in the embryo of the chicken (Gallus gallus domesticus)  ap. 185-196.  aThe metanephric kidneys of the chicken embryo, along with the chorioallantoic membrane, process water and ions to maintain osmoregulatory homeostasis. We hypothesized that changes in relative humidity (RH) and thus osmotic conditions during embryogenesis would alter the developmental trajectory of embryonic kidney function. White leghorn chicken eggs were incubated at one of 25–30% relative humidity, 55–60% relative humidity, and 85–90% relative humidity. Embryos were sampled at days 10, 12, 14, 16, and 18 to examine embryo and kidney mass, glomerular characteristics, body fluid osmolalities, hematological properties, and whole embryo oxygen consumption. Low and especially high RH elevated mortality, which was reflected in a 10–20% lower embryo mass on D18. Low RH altered several glomerular characteristics by day 18, including increased numbers of glomeruli per kidney, increased glomerular perfusion, and increased total glomerular volume, all indicating potentially increased functional kidney capacity. Hematological variables and plasma and amniotic fluid osmolalities remained within normal physiological values. However, the allantoic, amniotic and cloacal fluids had a significant increase in osmolality at most developmental points sampled. Embryonic oxygen consumption increased relative to control at both low and high relative humidities on Day 18, reflecting the increased metabolic costs of osmotic stress. Major differences in both renal structure and performance associated with changes in incubation humidity occurred after establishment of the metanephric kidney and persisted into late development, and likely into the postnatal period. These data indicate that the avian embryo deserves to be further investigated as a promising model for fetal programming of osmoregulatory function, and renal remodeling during osmotic stress.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGallus gallus 3aWhite Leghorn 3aamniotic fluid 3achicken eggs 3achickens 3achorioallantoic membrane 3acloaca 3aembryogenesis 3ahomeostasis 3aions 3akidneys 3amodels 3amortality 3aosmolality 3aosmotic stress 3aoxygen consumption 3apostpartum period 3arelative humidity 3arenal function 0aChicken embryo 0aKidney 0aGlomerulus 0aDevelopment 0aAmniotic fluid 0aAllantois 0aOsmoregulation 0aRenal remodeling 0aFetal programming1 aDubansky, Benjamin1 aBurggren, Warren W.0 tComparative biochemistry and physiology.g2017 Feb., v. 204 p.185-196dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12014x1095-64337nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cbpa.2016.11.0163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01725naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245010200167300001400269520076500283592002801048650002501076650001601101650001001117653002201127653003401149653002101183653002401204773010201228856008401330852000901414655001201423IND60599078320221120142742.0180702e20140220xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059907832DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enggeo.2013.12.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKahraman, S.14aThe determination of uniaxial compressive strength from point load strength for pyroclastic rocks  ap. 33-42.  aThe point load test has often been reported as an indirect measure of compressive strength. It has been used widely in practice due to easy testing, the simplicity of specimen preparation, and possible field applications. Many researchers have investigated the relation between uniaxial compressive strength (UCS) and point load index (Is) for different rock types. However, there are limited studies in the literature for soft rocks such as pyroclastic rocks. In this study, the relation between UCS and Is was investigated for pyroclastic rocks having UCS values are less than 50MPa. Very strong exponential relations were found for dry rocks, saturated rocks and both dry and saturated rocks. The results were also compared to the studies in the literature.  aPublisher supplied data 3acompression strength 3aengineering 3arocks 0aPyroclastic rocks 0aUniaxial compressive strength 0aPoint load index 0aRegression analysis0 tEngineering geology.g2014 Feb. 20, v. 170 p.33-42dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12441x0013-79527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enggeo.2013.12.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02907naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002100150245016500171300001600336520128400352592002801636650001801664650002001682650002001702650002101722650001501743650001001758650002401768650002601792650002801818650001901846650002401865650000901889650002001898653001801918653001501936653001501951653002001966653002501986700002102011700002802032700002702060700002302087700002202110700002202132700002102154773012102175856008402296852000902380655001202389IND60122377820221120200038.0150325e20140403xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012237782DNAL7 a10.1080/10590501.2014.9074592doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDe Flora, Silvio10aRationale and Approaches to the Prevention of Smoking-Related Diseases: Overview of Recent Studies on Chemoprevention of Smoking-Induced Tumors in Rodent Models  ap. 105-120.  aTobacco smoke plays a dominant role in the epidemiology of lung cancer, cancer at other sites, and a variety of other chronic diseases. It is the leading cause of death in developed countries, and the global burden of cancer is escalating in less developed regions. For a rational implementation of strategies exploitable for the prevention smoking-related diseases, it is crucial to elucidate both the mechanisms of action of cigarette smoke and the protective mechanisms of the host organism. The imperative primary prevention goal is to avoid any type of exposure to smoke. Epidemiological studies have shown that a decrease in the consumption of cigarettes can be successful in attenuating the epidemic of lung cancer in several countries. Chemoprevention by means of dietary and/or pharmacological agents provides a complementary strategy aimed at decreasing the risk of developing smoking-associated diseases in addicted current smokers, who are unable to quit smoking, and especially in involuntary smokers and ex-smokers. The availability of new animal models that are suitable to detect the carcinogenicity of cigarette smoke and to assess the underlying molecular mechanisms provides new tools for evaluating both safety and efficacy of putative chemopreventive agents.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal models 3acarcinogenicity 3achemoprevention 3achronic diseases 3acigarettes 3adeath 3adeveloped countries 3aenvironmental science 3aepidemiological studies 3alung neoplasms 3amechanism of action 3arisk 3asmoking (habit) 0aTobacco smoke 0amechanisms 0aprevention 0achemoprevention 0amolecular end-points1 aIzzotti, Alberto1 aD’Agostini, Francesco1 aLa Maestra, Sebastiano1 aMicale, Rosanna T.1 aCeccaroli, Chiara1 aSteele, Vernon E.1 aBalansky, Roumen0 tJournal of environmental science and health.g2014 Apr. 3, v. 32, no. 2 p.105-120dTaylor & Francisx1532-40957nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10590501.2014.9074593Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02894naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245013600164300001600300520139100316592002801707650004401735650001501779650002501794650001701819650002201836650001001858650001401868650001001882650000701892650002001899650002901919650001101948650002301959650002101982650001102003653002502014653001402039653001702053653002702070653002102097700001602118700002702134700002802161773012102189856008102310852000902391655001202400IND60584695220221119184046.0190318e201803  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058469522DNAL7 a10.1016/j.lwt.2017.10.0502doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRani, Poonam10aImpact of fermentation and extrusion processing on physicochemical, sensory and bioactive properties of rice-black gram mixed flour  ap. 155-163.  aCurrent study details about the impact of solid state fermentation and subsequent extrusion on the physicochemical, sensory and bioactive properties of the rice-black gram dough. Influence of the solid-state fermentation was evaluated, at three levels of yeast concentration (1–3%), sugar (4–8%) and fermentation time (2–6 h). Fermentation resulted in decreased pH and residual sugar, from 6.38 to 5.41 and 1.07 to 0.69%, respectively, whereas the titratable acidity was increased from 0.86 to 1.79%, after 6 h of fermentation. Moreover, solid state fermentation for 6 h leads to increased total phenolic content, antioxidant activity and protein content from 29.80 to 44.12 mg GAE/100 g, 3.38–5.10 mg GAE/100 g and 10.36–13.65%, respectively. FTIR analysis showed decreased crystallinity up on fermentation. Subsequently, dough fermented for 6 h with 3% yeast and 4% sugar (optimized condition) was considered for the extrusion processing, which leads to increased phenolic content and antioxidant activity up to 77.3 mg GAE/100 g, and 11.39 mg GAE/100 g, respectively. Expansion ratio, bulk density, water solubility and water absorption index were determined for product characterization. Furthermore, extrudate prepared from the fermented flour had slightly higher acceptability (mean score: 4.12) than the unfermented counter part (mean score: 3.75) out of 5.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aabsorption 3aantioxidant activity 3abulk density 3acrystal structure 3adough 3aextrusion 3aflour 3apH 3aprotein content 3asolid state fermentation 3asugars 3atitratable acidity 3awater solubility 3ayeasts 0aBioactive properties 0aExtrusion 0aFermentation 0aWater absorption index 0aSensory analysis1 aKumar, Amit1 aPurohit, Soumya Ranjan1 aRao, Pavuluri Srinivasa0 tLebensmittel-Wissenschaft + Technologie.g2018 Mar., v. 89 p.155-163dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl1644x0023-64387nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lwt.2017.10.0503Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02817naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100005500150245012000205520147500325592002801800650002301828650001901851650001501870650001301885650001101898650000901909650002901918650002101947650001601968651001001984653002501994653002202019653000802041653002502049653002602074700001302100700001202113700001702125700001602142700001802158773010102176856008502277852000902362655001202371IND60764050320221119111834.0220307e202203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076405032DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecocom.2022.1009792doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aQian, Dawen1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9807-809710aLandscape pattern changes across alpine shrub meadows gradient in warm-season pastures on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau  aGrassland degradation has been one of the major ecological concerns on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP) in recent years, but the degradation of alpine shrub meadows, and in particular the changes in its surface landscape pattern, has been less well assessed. This study selected a warm-season pasture on the QTP as a study area, and used an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) to collect aerial photographs along the degradation gradient from late June to early July 2018. We then classified the surface landscape as alpine shrub, alpine meadow, bare soil and plateau pika hole and analyzed the landscape pattern changes at different degradation levels. The results showed that the alpine shrub and alpine meadow dominated landscape degraded to a pattern of alpine meadow and bare soil dominance and pika hole pervasiveness, during which vegetation cover declined and the overall landscape pattern tended to fragment. Landscape pattern characteristics related to the area, density, connectivity and boundaries respond more clearly to the shrub degradation, with moderate degradation being the key stage at which the surface landscape pattern changes dramatically. Our study demonstrates a potential application of UAV technology in the study of grassland degradation. Future research should focus on the status, mechanisms and ecological effects of alpine shrub meadows degradation and the quantitative relationships between surface landscape patterns and ecological functions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOchotona curzoniae 3aalpine meadows 3alandscapes 3apastures 3ashrubs 3asoil 3aunmanned aerial vehicles 3avegetation cover 3awarm season 3aChina 0aAlpine shrub meadows 0aLandscape pattern 0aUAV 0adegradation gradient 0aQinghai-Tibet Plateau1 aLi, Qian1 aFan, Bo1 aGuo, Xiaowei1 aDu, Yangong1 aCao, Guangmin0 tEcological complexity.g2022 Mar., v. 49 p.100979-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:2171x1476-945X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecocom.2022.1009793Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02723naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001600152245006700168300001600235520138000251592002801631650003801659650002301697650001701720650002301737650001501760650001301775650002001788650001201808650001301820650001101833650001801844653001501862653001301877653002101890700002001911700005401931700001401985700002601999700002302025773013302048856008702181852000902268655001202277IND60605286120221119081554.0200110e201809  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060528612DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2018.05.0272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Peng10aExploring glycogen biosynthesis through Monte Carlo simulation  ap. 264-271.  aGlycogen, a complex branched polymer of glucose (average chain length ~10 monomer units), is the blood-sugar reservoir in humans and other animals. Certain aspects of its molecular structure relevant to its biological functions are currently unamenable to experimental exploration. Knowledge of these is needed to develop future models for quantitative data-fitting to obtain mechanistic understanding of the biosynthetic processes that give rise to glycogen structure. Monte Carlo simulations of the biosynthesis of this structure with realistic macromolecular parameters reveal how chain growth and stoppage (the latter assumed to be through both the action of glycogen branching enzyme and other degradative enzymes, and by hindrance) control structural features. The simulated chain-length, pair-distance and radial density distributions agree semi-quantitatively with the limited available data. The simulations indicate that a steady state in molecular structure and size is rapidly obtained, that molecular density reaches a maximum near the center of the particle (not at the periphery, as is the case with dendrimers), and that particle size is controlled by both enzyme activity and hindrance. This knowledge will aid in the understanding of diabetes (loss of blood-sugar control), which has been found to involve subtle differences in glycogen molecular structure.  aPublisher supplied data 3a1,4-alpha-glucan branching enzyme 3aMonte Carlo method 3abiosynthesis 3achemical structure 3adendrimers 3adiabetes 3aenzyme activity 3aglucose 3aglycogen 3amodels 3aparticle size 0aSimulation 0aGlycogen 0aBranched polymer1 aNada, Sharif S.1 aTan, Xinle1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7268-25361 aDeng, Bin1 aSullivan, Mitchell A.1 aGilbert, Robert G.0 tInternational journal of biological macromolecules.g2018 Sept., v. 116 p.264-271dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12340x0141-81307nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2018.05.0273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03036naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002100151245012500172300001800297520165500315592002801970650001401998650002202012650001002034650001402044650001802058650001602076650002002092650001402112650000902126650001802135650001302153650001602166650001302182650001702195650001602212650002102228653002002249653002102269653001902290653001702309653001702326700001902343773009802362856008502460852000902545655001202554IND60579997620221120220249.0171215e20171003xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057999762DNAL7 a10.1080/07373937.2016.12732302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWaghulde, Mrunal10aComparative study of encapsulated vildagliptin microparticles produced by spray drying and solvent evaporation technique  ap. 1644-1654.  aVildagliptin (VLG), an antihyperglycemic drug, having high water solubility and shorter elimination half-life. This leads to administer VLG frequently to maintain its therapeutic efficacy. Hence the goal of this work was to formulate sustained release polymeric VLG microparticles by spray drying technique using 3 ² full factorial design (Design-Expert Software). Ethyl cellulose (EC) and span-80 were used as encapsulating material and surfactant, respectively. This work furthermore assessed the probability of encapsulating VLG by single emulsion oil in oil (o/o) solvent evaporation technique. The resultant microparticles from these two methods were evaluated to demonstrate the significant differences in their particle size, percentage yield, drug loading (DL), encapsulation efficiency (EE), in vitro drug release, surface morphology, and drug–polymer compatibility. EE of microparticles prepared by spray drying and solvent evaporation technique was in the range of 71.42–89.87% and 51.79–64.03%, respectively. The in vitro drug release study from the microparticles prepared by both methods was conducted for 12 h. Microparticles prepared by solvent evaporation technique showed incomplete VLG release in 12 h. To visualize the effects of independent factors (polymer and surfactant amount) on dependent factors (EE and DL), 2D contour and 3D surface plots were constructed. Significant variations in microparticles’ physicochemical properties were observed with two formulation techniques. Optimum EE and sustained drug release of VLG–EC microparticles were conclusive using spray drying and solvent evaporation techniques.  aPublisher supplied data 3acellulose 3acomputer software 3adrugs 3aemulsions 3aencapsulation 3aevaporation 3aglycemic effect 3ahalf life 3aoils 3aparticle size 3apolymers 3aprobability 3asolvents 3aspray drying 3asurfactants 3awater solubility 0aEthyl cellulose 0afactorial design 0amicroparticles 0aspray drying 0avildagliptin1 aNaik, Jitendra0 tDrying technology.g2017 Oct. 3, v. 35, no. 13 p.1644-1654dTaylor & Francisx1532-23007nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/07373937.2016.12732303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03559naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245015800165300001800323520194300341592002802284650001602312650001502328650002502343650001502368650001902383650001002402650002602412650002702438650000902465650002702474650001502501650002102516650001102537650001202548650001402560650001402574650002402588650002202612650001902634650001402653650003202667650001302699650003502712650001402747700001602761700001802777700002002795773011202815856008102927852000903008655001203017IND60580784220221122075444.0171001e201709  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058078422DNAL7 a10.1007/s12649-016-9710-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHaq, Monjurul10aQuality Properties and Bio-potentiality of Edible Oils from Atlantic Salmon By-products Extracted by Supercritial Carbon Dioxide and Conventional Methods  ap. 1953-1967.  aFish processing industries produce a large amount of by-products every year which are just dumped or used for less productive purposes. This paper instructs the approaches for the production of edible oils from Atlantic salmon by-products for value addition of fish wastes and meeting the increased demand of omega polyunsaturated fatty acids. Atlantic salmon by-products (belly part, trimmed muscle, frame bone and skin) oils extracted by supercritical carbon dioxide (SC-CO₂) and n-hexane were compared with belly part oil (PBePO) obtained from traditional pressing. Oil extracted by n-hexane, was considered as total oil and the yield was higher amongst with 45.46 ± 0.57–49.26 ± 0.90 %, followed by SC-CO₂ and pressed oil with 76.12 ± 1.02–86.99 ± 1.14 and 61.83 ± 0.0.84 % (of total oil, dry matter basis), respectively. SC-CO₂ extracted oils showed attractive color and better viscosity property than PBePO and n-hexane extracted oil. The acid value, peroxide value and free fatty acid value of PBePO were lowest (6.29 ± 0.32, 0.97 ± 0.12 and 2.37 ± 0.19 respectively) followed by SC-CO₂ (7.48 ± 0.62–8.03 ± 0.35, 1.10 ± 0.2–1.25 ± 0.14 and 3.23 ± 0.31–3.89 ± 0.40 respectively) and n-hexane (10.28 ± 1.25–11.03 ± 0.52, 1.36 ± 0.28–1.68 ± 0.20 and 4.08 ± 0.22–4.74 ± 0.18 respectively) extracted oils. p-Anisidine value and total oxidation value of SC-CO₂ extracted oils were significantly (P < 0.05) lower than PBePO and n-hexane extracted oils. SC-CO₂ extracted oils displayed higher radical scavenging activity and longer oxidative stability period (1.37 ± 0.03–2.14 ± 0.03 h). There was no significance difference in fatty acid compositions among the extracted oils.

Studies in systems with multiple predator species have shown that the strength of these interactions may not be predictable and is largely dependent on individual behavioural traits, species density and habitat complexity. Although the association of prey consumption and satiation of a foraging predator has long been recognized, there has been relatively little research on how prey availability affects multiple predators’ effects. In this work, we present a framework to investigate the variation in two coexisting/competing predators’ effects on prey risk as affected by the prey availability rate. Functional responses by each predator species were first studied in single-predator treatments. Then, the intra- and inter-specific competition was investigated by employing additive and substitutative experimental designs to highlight the nature of multiple effects. Intra- and interspecific interactions were found to be similar and there was risk reduction, and risk enhancement for the prey at intermediate and high levels, respectively, according to the multiplicative risk model (MRM). The results indicated that when similar predators are concerned, the outcomes of MRM may vary according to the functional response curve of these predators. Thus, studies involving a wide range of prey densities are required to explore the nature of interactions. Moreover, this kind of experimental data can contribute to unravelling complexities in theoretical approaches by earlier studies and ultimately promote understanding the effect of multiple predators on prey population regulation.  aPublisher supplied data 3arisk 3acommunity structure 3aexperimental design 3amodels 3apredators 3ainterspecific competition 3asatiety 3arisk reduction 3aforaging 3ahabitats 0aTomato 0afunctional response 0aNesidiocoris tenuis 0aMacrolophus pygmaeus 0aMultiple predator effect 0aFunctional response 0aPrey density1 aPerdikis, Dionyssios Ch.1 aFantinou, Argyro A.0 tBasic and applied ecology.g2013 Nov., v. 14, no. 7 p.605-613dElsevier GmbHwJournal:jnl3925117x1439-17917nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.baae.2013.08.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle05001naa a2200697 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100002000154245020500174500002200379520314000401592002803541650002703569650002403596650000903620650000903629650001103638650001603649650001003665650002303675650000903698650001803707650001803725650001303743650001603756650002203772650001503794650001403809653000703823653000803830653000903838653000803847653001003855653000703865653000703872653000803879653000803887653000703895653000703902653000803909653000803917653000703925653000703932653000803939653000803947653000803955653000903963653001303972653004703985653001704032700001704049700002204066700002304088773011604111856005504227852000904282655001204291IND60795514520221122232856.0221004e20220925xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079551452DNAL7 a10.1016/j.anifeedsci.2022.1154642doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJang, Jae-Cheol12aA systematic review and meta-analysis of the growth performance effects of feeding diets containing corn distillers dried grains with solubles (cDDGS) and feed enzymes to broiler chickensRunning head:  aPre-press version  aNumerous studies have been conducted to determine the effects of feeding diets containing variable inclusion rates of corn distillers dried grains with solubles (cDDGS), with and without supplemental enzymes, on growth performance of broilers but responses among these studies are inconsistent. Therefore, a systematic review and a meta-analysis of results from studies published from 2009 to 2018 was conducted to: 1) quantitatively summarize the impact of feeding cDDGS diets on body weight gain (BWG), feed intake (FI), and gain to feed ratio (G:F); and 2) evaluate the effect of adding various types of exogenous enzymes (xylanase; complex = multi-carbohydrases; cocktail = multi-carbohydrases plus protease) without or with phytase on growth performance of broilers. Mean differences of BWG, FI, and G:F were expressed as a percentage between feeding control corn-soybean meal (SBM)-based diets and diets containing cDDGS to broilers using data from 20 studies with 71 observations. Likewise, mean differences were determined for the same growth performance variables reported in 10 studies that provided 47 observations comparing the effects of adding exogenous enzymes to corn-SBM-based diets and cDDGS diets. The heterogeneity (I²-statistic, %) across studies was calculated based on Cochran’s Q-statistic method, and was 66.7% for BWG, 63.4% for FI, and 33.1% for G:F, indicating low similarity (homogeneity) between studies. Mixed multi-variable models were applied to address the factors affecting high heterogeneity which included dietary energy system, oil content of cDDGS, and feeding period. Adding cDDGS to broiler diets resulted in a 1.0% decrease (P < 0.01) in G:F for the overall feeding period. Feeding cDDGS to finisher broilers resulted in a 0.78% improvement (P < 0.05) for BWG and 1.60% improvement (P < 0.01) for FI. However, starter broilers (1 to 21 days of age) fed cDDGS diets had 2.44% lower (P < 0.05) BWG and 3.18% less (P < 0.01) FI compared with feeding corn-SBM diets. Broilers fed diets containing less than 100g/kg cDDGS had the greatest improvement (P < 0.01) in BWG (4.52%), followed by a 2.32% improvement in BWG when fed diets containing 100 to 200g/kg cDDGS (2.32%), but BWG was reduced by 1.02% when feeding diets containing more than 200g/kg cDDGS. Similarly, feeding diets containing less than 100g/kg cDDGS had increased (P < 0.01) FI (2.83%), but including 100 to 200g/kg cDDGS, and more than 200g/kg cDDGS in the diets reduced FI by 1.30% and 2.48%, respectively. Covariance analysis indicated that each percentage unit increase in diet inclusion level of cDDGS was associated with a 0.30% decrease (P < 0.01) in BWG and 0.43% decrease in FI. Broilers had increased (P < 0.05) BWG when fed cDDGS diets containing xylanase (7.41%) and multi-carbohydrases (7.27%) for the overall feeding period. Results from this meta-analysis indicate that improvements in BWG and FI are greatest in finisher diets at inclusion rates of less than 100g/kg cDDGS, and the addition of xylanase or carbohydrase mixtures were effective in ameliorating the reduction in BWG when added to cDDGS-based diets.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanalysis of covariance 3abody weight changes 3acorn 3adiet 3aenergy 3afeed intake 3afeeds 3agrowth performance 3ahead 3alipid content 3ameta-analysis 3aphytases 3aproteinases 3asystematic review 3atechnology 3axylanases 0aAA 0aAME 0aAMEn 0aBWG 0acDDGS 0aCV 0aDM 0aEEL 0aFCR 0aFI 0aGE 0aG:F 0aGIT 0aMD 0aME 0aNSP 0aSID 0aTME 0aTMEn 0abroilers 0acorn distillers dried grains with solubles 0afeed enzymes1 aZeng, Zhikai1 aUrriola, Pedro E.1 aShurson, Gerald C.0 tAnimal feed science and technology.g2022 Sept. 25,  p.115464-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl7460x0377-84017nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.anifeedsci.2022.115464  aDNAL 7aarticle01854naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001400139245012300153300001800276520077000294592002801064650001401092650001301106650001401119650002301133700001901156700002001175700001901195700001601214700002301230700003201253773014701285856007501432852000901507655001201516IND60539169420170621000000.0160815e20140618xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053916942DNAL7 a10.1021/ja503272q2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aQin, Peng10aPerovskite Solar Cells with 12.8% Efficiency by Using Conjugated Quinolizino Acridine Based Hole Transporting Material  ap. 8516-8519.  aA low band gap quinolizino acridine based molecule was designed and synthesized as new hole transporting material for organic–inorganic hybrid lead halide perovskite solar cells.

Among the most important parameters that need to be optimized are those related to substrate lattice-matching compatibility. Here, we directly grow InGaN nanowires (NWs) on a metallic Ti/Si template, for improving the water splitting performance compared to a bare Si substrate. The open circuit potential of the epitaxially grown InGaN NWs on metallic Ti was almost two times higher than when directly grown on the Si substrate. The interfacial transfer resistance was also reduced significantly after introducing the metallic Ti interlayer. An applied-bias-photon-to-current conversion efficiency of 2.2% and almost unity faradaic efficiency for hydrogen generation were achieved using this approach. The InGaN NWs grown on Ti showed improved stability for hydrogen generation under continuous operation conditions, when compared to those grown on Si, emphasizing the role of the semiconductor-on-metal approach in enhancing the overall efficiency of water splitting devices.  aPublisher supplied data 3ahydrogen 3ahydrogen production 3ananowires 3aphotocatalysts 3aproduction technology 3arenewable energy sources 3asilicon 3atitanium1 aMin, Jung-Wook1 aZhao, Chao1 aNg, Tien Khee1 aIdriss, Hicham1 aOoi, Boon S.0 tJournal of materials chemistry.g2018 Apr. 24, v. 6, no. 16 p.6922-6930dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26903x2050-74967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c7ta11338b3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03018naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001900148245009300167300001600260500001500276520180100291592002802092650001402120650001102134650002202145650001402167650001602181650002902197651001702226653001902243653001202262653001102274653001302285653001902298653001602317653001702333700001902350773014702369856008302516852000902599655001202608IND60111949120221118010739.0190411e201312  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011194912DNAL7 a10.1016/j.baae.2013.09.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIsbell, Forest10aHuman impacts on minimum subsets of species critical for maintaining ecosystem structure  ap. 623-629.  a2019-12-04  aHumans have indirectly influenced species at lower trophic levels by driving losses of apex consumers. Furthermore, humans have indirectly influenced species at higher trophic levels by driving losses of primary producers. Beyond these broad classes of apex consumers and primary producers, it remains challenging to identify minimum subsets of species that are particularly important for maintaining ecosystem structure and functioning. Here we use a novel method at the intersection of control theory and network theory to identify a minimum set of driver node species upon which ecosystem structure strongly depends. Specifically, humans could unintentionally completely restructure ecosystems (i.e., change species abundances from any initial values to any final values, including zero) by altering the abundances of these few critical driver node species. We then quantify the proportion of these driver nodes that are influenced by humans, top predators, and primary producers in several marine food webs. We find that humans could unintentionally completely restructure marine food webs while only directly influencing less than one in four species. Additionally, humans directly influence: (1) most or all of the species necessary to completely restructure each network, (2) more driver nodes than top predators, and at least as many driver nodes as primary producers, and (3) an increasing proportion of driver nodes over time in the Adriatic Sea. We conclude that humans have potentially huge impacts on marine ecosystems while directly influencing only the relatively small subset of species that are currently fished. It may be possible to reduce unintentional and undesirable cascading human influences by decreasing human impacts on driver node species in these and other food webs.  aPublisher supplied data 3afood webs 3ahumans 3amarine ecosystems 3apredators 3amethodology 3aanthropogenic activities 3aAdriatic Sea 0aControl theory 0aFishing 0aMarine 0aFood web 0aNetwork theory 0anew methods 0aConservation1 aLoreau, Michel0 tBasic and applied ecology.g2013 Dec., v. 14, no. 8 p.623-629dElsevier GmbHaGesellschaft für ÖkologiewJournal:jnl3925117x1439-17917nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.baae.2013.09.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02153naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002000152245009300172300001600265520100500281592002801286650001501314650002801329650001601357650001501373650001901388650001101407650001501418653002001433653002401453653001601477653001701493700002001510700001901530700002401549773009801573856008701671852000901758655001201767IND60628480220221121094221.0190410e20190315xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062848022DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apenergy.2019.01.0762doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRazavi, Rouzbeh12aA practical feature-engineering framework for electricity theft detection in smart grids  ap. 481-494.  aDespite many potential advantages, Advanced Metering Infrastructures have introduced new ways to falsify meter readings and commit electricity theft.

This study further examines some important practical aspects of deploying theft detection including: the detection delay; the required size of historical demand data; the accuracy in detecting thefts of various types and intensity; detecting irregular and unseen attacks; and the computational complexity of the detection algorithm.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3aartificial intelligence 3aelectricity 3ahouseholds 3ainfrastructure 3amodels 3aprediction 0aTheft detection 0aFeature engineering 0aData mining 0aSmart meters1 aGharipour, Amin1 aFleury, Martin1 aAkpan, Ikpe Justice0 tApplied energy.g2019 Mar. 15, v. 238 p.481-494dElsevier LtdwJournal:11876x0306-26197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2019.01.0763Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02864naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094024002200127024001900149040001800168100001100186245012900197300001600326506007600342520141000418592002801828506003701856650002001893650001901913650001301932650001201945650002901957650001301986650001201999653003402011653001602045653002102061653001802082700001702100700001602117700002102133773018802154856007902342852000902421655001202430IND60230441820221207101101.0150614e20150106xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6023044182DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.14226571122doi7 aPMC42916562pmcid7 a255353792pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDu, Te10aPatterns of accumulation of miRNAs encoded by herpes simplex virus during productive infection, latency, and on reactivation  ap. E49-E55.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe key events in herpes simplex virus (HSV) infections are ( i ) replication at a portal of entry into the body modeled by infection of cultured cells; ( ii ) establishment of a latent state characterized by a sole latency-associated transcript and microRNAs (miRNAs) modeled in murine peripheral ganglia 30 d after inoculation; and ( iii ) reactivation from the latent state modeled by excision and incubation of ganglia in medium containing anti-NGF antibody for a timespan of a single viral replicative cycle. In this report, we examine the pattern of synthesis and accumulation of 18 HSV-1 miRNAs in the three models. We report the following: ( i ) H2-3P, H3-3P, H4-3P, H5-3P, H6-3P, and H7-5P accumulated in ganglia harboring latent virus. All but H4-3P were readily detected in productively infected cells, and most likely they originate from three transcriptional units. ( ii ) H8-5P, H15, H17, H18, H26, and H27 accumulated during reactivation. Of this group, only H26 and H27 could be detected in productively infected cells. ( iii ) Of the 18 we have examined, only 10 miRNAs were found to accumulate above background levels in productively infected cells. The disparity in the accumulation of miRNAs in cell culture and during reactivation may reflect differences in the patterns of regulation of viral gene expression during productive infection and during reactivation from the latent state.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3agene expression 3aherpes simplex 3amicroRNA 3aneurons 3atranscription (genetics) 3avirology 3aviruses 0aregulation of gene expression 0aalpha genes 0abeta/gamma genes 0atranscription1 aHan, Zhiyuan1 aZhou, Grace1 aRoizman, Bernard0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2015 Jan. 6, v. 112, no. 1 p.E49-E55dNational Academy of ScienceswJournal:jnl45680x0027-84247nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.14226571123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02033naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001100151245007800162300001600240520074200256592002800998650001601026650001901042650001701061650001601078650001401094650002601108650002801134650001201162650000901174653002701183653001901210653002601229653002701255653001601282700001501298700001401313700001601327700001701343700001201360773012101372856008501493852000901578655001201587IND60579997820221120220446.0170907e20170703xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057999782DNAL7 a10.1080/10590501.2017.13288282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Na10aImmunoassay approach for diagnosis of exposure to pyrrolizidine alkaloids  ap. 127-139.  aNumerous pyrrolizidine alkaloid (PA) poisoning cases have been documented worldwide. Protein covalent binding with reactive metabolites generated from metabolic activation of PAs to form pyrrole-protein adducts is suggested to be a primary mechanism of PA-induced toxicities. The present study aimed to develop antibodies for diagnosis of PA exposure. Polyclonal antibodies were raised in rabbits and proven to specifically recognize pyrrole-protein adducts regardless of amino acid residues modified by the reactive metabolites of PAs. The developed antibodies were successfully applied to detect pyrrole-protein adducts in blood samples obtained from PA-treated rats and exhibited a potential for the clinical diagnosis of PA exposure.  aPublisher supplied data 3aamino acids 3ablood sampling 3aimmunoassays 3ametabolites 3apoisoning 3apolyclonal antibodies 3apyrrolizidine alkaloids 3arabbits 3arats 0aPyrrolizidine alkaloid 0ahepatotoxicity 0apolyclonal antibodies 0apyrrole-protein adduct 0aimmunoassay1 aZhang, Fan1 aLian, Wei1 aWang, Huali1 aZheng, Jiang1 aLin, Ge0 tJournal of environmental science and health.g2017 July 3, v. 35, no. 3 p.127-139dTaylor & Francisx1532-40957nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10590501.2017.13288283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03595naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003800113040001800151100001800169245010600187300001600293520155500309592002801864650002101892650002601913650003001939650002701969650002601996650001302022650001302035650002102048650001702069650002802086650001102114650002102125650001802146650002202164650001502186650006102201650002102262650005902283650003802342650006502380650001102445650003802456650004202494650010902536650005102645650003902696650003802735700001702773773011102790856008402901990002302985852000903008655001203017IND60097869420221118063924.0141104e20120815xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009786942DNAL7 a226838722pmid7 a10.1016/j.ejphar.2012.05.0472doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCrowe, Andrew10aABCB1 (P-glycoprotein) reduces bacterial attachment to human gastrointestinal LS174T epithelial cells  ap. 204-210.  aThe aim of this project was to show elevated P-glycoprotein (P-gp) expression decreasing bacterial association with LS174T human gastrointestinal cells, and that this effect could be reversed upon blocking functional P-gp efflux. Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Lactobacillus acidophilus and numerous strains of Escherichia coli, from commensal to enteropathogenic and enterohaemorrhagic strains (O157:H7) were fluorescently labelled and incubated on LS174T cultures either with or without P-gp amplification using rifampicin. PSC-833 was used as a potent functional P-gp blocking agent. Staphylococcus and Pseudomonas displayed the greatest association with the LS174T cells. Surprisingly, lactobacilli retained more fluorescence than enteropathogenic -E. coli in this system. Irrespective of attachment differences between the bacterial species, the increase in P-gp protein expression decreased bacterial fluorescence by 25–30%. This included the GFP-labelled E. coli, and enterohaemorrhagic E. coli (O157:H7). Blocking P-gp function through the co-administration of PSC-833 increased the amount of bacteria associated with P-gp expressing LS174T cells back to control levels. As most bacteria were affected to the same degree, irrespective of pathogenicity, it is unlikely that P-gp has a direct influence on adhesion of bacteria, and instead P-gp may be playing an indirect role by secreting a bank of endogenous factors or changing the local environment to one less suited to bacterial growth in general.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3aKlebsiella pneumoniae 3aLactobacillus acidophilus 3aPseudomonas aeruginosa 3aStaphylococcus aureus 3aadhesion 3abacteria 3aepithelial cells 3afluorescence 3agastrointestinal system 3ahumans 3amicrobial growth 3apathogenicity 3aprotein synthesis 3arifampicin 2aAttachment Sites, Microbiologicalxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aCell Line, Tumor 2aEpithelial Cellsxmetabolismxmicrobiologyxpathology. 2aEscherichia coli O157xmetabolism 2aGastrointestinal Tractxmetabolismxmicrobiologyxpathology. 2aHumans 2aKlebsiella pneumoniaexmetabolism 2aLactobacillus acidophilusxmetabolism 2aATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1xantagonists & inhibitorsxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B. 2aPseudomonas aeruginosaxmetabolism 2aStaphylococcus aureusxmetabolism1 aBebawy, Mary0 tEuropean journal of pharmacology.g2012 Aug. 15, v. 689, no. 1-3 p.204-210dElsevier B.V.x0014-29997nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ejphar.2012.05.0473Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02484naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245013700165300001800302520125400320592002801574650004401602650001501646650002201661650001601683650001201699650001201711650001101723650001901734650000701753650001401760650003301774650001601807650002501823700002101848700001501869773011201884856008101996852000902077655001202086IND60580784420221122075428.0171001e201709  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058078442DNAL7 a10.1007/s12649-016-9714-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMahdi, Zainab10aInfluence of Pyrolysis Conditions on Surface Characteristics and Methylene Blue Adsorption of Biochar Derived from Date Seed Biomass  ap. 2061-2073.  aBiochar samples were prepared from date seed biomass using slow pyrolysis at different temperatures (350–550 °C) and heating time (1–3 h). The influence of pyrolysis temperature and heating time on the physiochemical properties of the biochar were studied. Methylene blue (MB) adsorption by the biochar was also studied. Biochar yield decreased with increasing pyrolysis temperature and heating time. Carbon content, ash content and pH of the biochar increased with increasing pyrolysis temperature as well as heating time. FTIR analysis and scanning electron microscopy indicated that the biochars possess various surface functional groups such as carboxylic and phenolic groups. Batch adsorption results showed that the capacity of biochar to remove MB from aqueous solutions correlated positively with pyrolysis temperature and heating time. The highest MB removal capacity was achieved by the biochar prepared at 550 °C and 3 h heating time. The equilibrium results for MB adsorption on the biochar prepared at 550 °C and 3 h was well fitted to Langmuir with maximum adsorption (qₘₐₓ) of 0.133 mM g⁻¹ (42.57 mg g⁻¹). The results suggest that date seed derived biochar can be a viable option for wastewater treatment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aadsorption 3aaqueous solutions 3aash content 3abiochar 3abiomass 3acarbon 3amethylene blue 3apH 3apyrolysis 3ascanning electron microscopy 3atemperature 3awastewater treatment1 aHanandeh, Ali El1 aYu, Qiming0 tWaste and biomass valorization.g2017 Sept., v. 8, no. 6 p.2061-2073dSpringer Netherlandsx1877-26417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12649-016-9714-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02543naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245013600158300001800294520129800312592002801610650001401638650003401652650001401686650001301700650001901713650001601732700001701748700001301765700001601778700001901794700001601813700001601829700001701845700001401862700001701876700001701893773014001910856007402050852000902124655001202133IND60618540820221120123856.0181030e20180424xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061854082DNAL7 a10.1039/c7ta11339k2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLuo, Zhenghui12aA universal nonfullerene electron acceptor matching with different band-gap polymer donors for high-performance polymer solar cells  ap. 6874-6881.  aUnlike fullerene derivatives, current nonfullerene n-type organic semiconductor (n-OS) electron acceptors can rarely work efficiently with different band-gap polymer donors in polymer solar cells (PSCs). To address this issue, we designed and synthesized a new n-OS electron acceptor, namely m-MeIC, which is proved to be effective with different band-gap polymer donors including wide band-gap J71, medium band-gap PBDB-T and low band-gap PCE-10. Photovoltaic devices based on J71:m-MeIC and PBDB-T:m-MeIC achieved power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) as high as 12.08% and 10.93%, respectively. The difference in PCEs between the devices based on J71 and PBDB-T is mainly ascribed to the gap of the open circuit voltage. It should be mentioned that the J71-based device exhibited an energy loss of 0.62 eV, which is significantly lower than the most reported energy loss. For the low band-gap polymer donor PCE-10, the device also showed a relatively high PCE of 8.34%. The different device performances are analyzed in depth from charge transport and collection, to recombination loss mechanism and morphology of blend films. This work reveals that the new n-type organic semiconductor is very promising as a universal nonfullerene acceptor, pairing with different band-gap polymer donors.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemistry 3aelectric potential difference 3afullerene 3apolymers 3asemiconductors 3asolar cells1 aLi, Guanghao1 aGao, Wei1 aWu, Kailong1 aZhang, Zhi-Guo1 aQiu, Beibei1 aBin, Haijun1 aXue, Lingwei1 aLiu, Feng1 aLi, Yongfang1 aYang, Chuluo0 tJournal of materials chemistry.g2018 Apr. 24, v. 6, no. 16 p.6874-6881dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26903x2050-74967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c7ta11339k3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02627naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002000149245007100169300001800240500002000258500000900278520165700287592002801944650001401972650001501986650001802001650001402019650001102033651001202044700001802056773013402074856008402208852000902292655001202301IND60677162720221121001143.0220805e201909  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067716272DNAL7 a10.2135/cropsci2018.11.06742doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchmitz, Andrew14aThe Dynamics of Sugarcane and Sugar Yields in Florida: 1950–2018  ap. 1880-1886.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aepub  aFlorida is the largest producer of sugarcane (Saccharum spp.) in the United States. Since 1911, the University of Florida continues to develop new sugarcane cultivars that are better adapted to the Florida environment. We use piecewise regression to determine the growth in both Florida sugarcane and sugar yields, and how new sugarcane cultivars have positively affected yields. We use breakpoints for periods between 1950 and 2018: Scenario 1 (1950–2018), Scenario 2 (1950–1980 and 1981–2018), Scenario 3 (1950–1980, 1981–2000, and 2001–2018), and Scenario 4 (1950–1968, 1969–2000, and 2001–2018). In most scenarios, new sugarcane cultivars have significantly increased sugarcane and sugar yield, as well as sugar content. For 1950 to 2018, sugarcane yield increased by 21.3 Mg ha⁻¹ (30%, P < 0.01) and sugar yield increased by 5.1 Mg ha⁻¹ (78%, P < 0.01). Sugar content also increased significantly (P < 0.01). Before 1980, sugarcane yield significantly decreased (P < 0.05), whereas sugar yield showed neither a significant increase nor decrease. For 1980 to 2018, both sugarcane and sugar yields significantly increased (P < 0.01). Sugar yield decreased from 0.16 Mg ha⁻¹ yr⁻¹ for 1950 to 1980 to 0.10 Mg ha⁻¹ yr⁻¹ for 1981 to 2000. Sugarcane yield had the same rate of increase for 1980 to 2000 (0.66 Mg ha⁻¹ yr⁻¹) and for 2001 to 2018 (0.69 Mg ha⁻¹ yr⁻¹). There was neither a significant increase nor decrease in sugarcane and sugar yields before 1968. For 1969 to 2000, the increase in sugarcane yield (0.29 Mg ha⁻¹ yr⁻¹) was less than the increase in sugar yield (0.09 Mg ha⁻¹ yr⁻¹).  aPublisher supplied data 3aSaccharum 3acrop yield 3asugar content 3asugarcane 3asugars 3aFlorida1 aZhang, Fangyi0 tCrop science.g2019 Sept., v. 59, no. 5 p.1880-1886dThe Crop Science Society of America, Inc.wJournal:jnl44570x0011-183X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2135/cropsci2018.11.06743Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03716naa a2200697 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100001400154245017200168500002200340520192100362592002802283650001302311650001302324650001002337650001702347650001202364650002302376650001102399650001802410650001702428653000902445653000902454653000902463653001002472653000802482653000802490653000802498653000802506653000802514653000802522653001102530653000802541653001002549653001102559653001002570653000802580653000902588653001002597653000902607653001802616653001702634653002602651653001202677653000602689653001702695653001902712700001502731700002302746700001502769700001402784700001402798700001402812773011602826856005502942852000902997655001203006IND60795514720221122222931.0221004e20220930xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079551472DNAL7 a10.1016/j.anifeedsci.2022.1154682doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKim, Y.R.10aRumen methane abatement by phlorotannin derivatives (phlorofucofuroeckol-A, dieckol, and 8,8’-bieckol) and its relationship with the hydroxyl group and ether linkage  aPre-press version  aBrown algae supplementation is one method for lowering rumen CH₄ production because of the ability of the brown algae's phlorotannins to mitigate enteric CH₄ emissions. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of phlorotannin derivatives, phlorofucofuroeckol-A (PFFA), dieckol (DE), and 8,8’-bieckol (BE), on rumen in vitro CH₄ emissions and to investigate the relationship between the number of their hydroxyl groups or ether linkages with CH₄ reduction rate of phlorotannin derivatives. Rumen fluid obtained from two cannulated Holstein cows were incubated in an in vitro batch culture system for 24 and 48h. Each phlorotannin derivative was added to the substrate at the five different concentrations of 0, 2, 4, 8, and 16g/kg on a dry matter basis. Methane emission was decreased by 16g/kg PFFA (linear, P <.01; quadratic, P = 0.06) and DE (linear, P <.01) supplementation and by 0.8g/kg BE (linear, P <.01; quadratic, P = 0.05) addition at 24h of incubation. There were no differences in rumen CH₄ production at 48h of fermentation. Total gas production was decreased at 24h of incubation by PFFA (linear, P <.01; quadratic, P <.01), DE (linear, P <.01), and BE (linear, P <.01; quadratic, P = 0.02). The model for total gas production and CH₄ emissions upon PFFA (r² = 0.69, P <.01, and r² = 0.65, P <.01, respectively) and BE supplementation (r² = 0.42, P = 0.04, and r² = 0.71, P <.01, respectively) showed a quadratic correlation. The CH₄ abatement rate was positively correlated with the number of hydroxyl groups and ether linkages of phlorotannin derivatives (r² = 0.46, P <.01, and r² = 0.32, P <.01, respectively). In conclusion, the three pure and individual phlorotannin derivatives (PFFA, DE, and BE) in brown algae are candidates for rumen CH₄ abatement, and their CH₄ mitigating effects could depend on the number of the hydroxyl groups and ether linkages.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHolstein 3acannulas 3afeeds 3afermentation 3amethane 3amethane production 3amodels 3aphlorotannins 3arumen fluids 0aA:P, 0aADF, 0aADL, 0aBCFA, 0aBE, 0aCA, 0aCP, 0aDE, 0aDM, 0aEE, 0aIVDMD, 0aMW, 0aaNDF, 0aNH3-N, 0aPFFA, 0aPT, 0aTGP, 0aTVFA, 0aVFA, 0arumen methane 0aphlorotannin 0aphlorofucofuroeckol-A 0adieckol 0a8 0a8’-bieckol 0ahydroxyl group1 aPark, K.Y.1 aNejad, J.

Many studies have used the land use and land cover (LULC) to model non-point pollution sources. In this article we evaluate the relationship between LULC and five water quality parameters using different zones of analysis: riparian buffers (B) and exclusive contribution areas (ECA). The five parameters are nitrate, nitrite, total ammonia nitrogen, total phosphorous and dissolved oxygen. Analyses were performed on riparian zones of different widths and ECAs to verify if the effect of the land cover on the water quality of the stream decreases with the increased distance. The urban and agricultural/pasture categories of LULC were characterized as pollution sources while vegetation (Forest and Riparian Forest) as pollution sink (filter). We proposed a Land Cover Pollution index (LCPI) which is a ratio between source and sink to substitute the individual LULC categories. The source and sink categories were selected considering our knowledge of the LULC relationship and the sign of the Pearson's Correlation Coefficient. The LCPI varied between 0.11 in the 150m buffer (higher filter effect) and a maximum of 27.99 (largest source effect). Additionally, we transformed the water quality data in incremental loads per unit area so that each station could be considered independent from the others and be compared between themselves independently of the contribution area they represent. Our method also included only data from the rain season, the beginning of which was determined using the hydrograms of discharge data. Results indicate that the index is better than the individual LULC classes to explain this relationship, especially in riparian zones. In 12 out of 15 models the coefficient of determination (R2) increased by 11 to 155%, when we use the index instead of the LULC classes. We believe that these good results can be attributed to the LCPI but also to the special processing of the water quality data making it more sound for statistical processing.  aPublisher supplied data 3aammonium nitrogen 3acatenas 3acorrelation 3adissolved oxygen 3aland cover 3aland use and land cover maps 3amodels 3anitrates 3anitrites 3apastures 3aphosphorus 3apoint source pollution 3ariparian areas 3ariparian buffers 3ariparian forests 3astreams 3awater quality 3awatersheds 3awet season 0aWater quality 0aLand use/land cover 0aDiffuse pollution 0aLCPI index 0aBrazil 0aRegression1 aMaillard, Philippe1 ade Andrade Pinto, Eber José0 tCatena.g2017 Mar., v. 150 p.124-132dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6271x0341-81627nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.catena.2016.11.0153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03839naa a2200661 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245014100169520197600310592002802286650001202314650003502326650001502361650001402376650001202390650001302402650001102415650002602426650002002452650001702472650002502489650000902514650002202523650001502545650001302560650004302573650001802616650002202634650001202656653001902668653000902687653001202696653001102708653001902719700001302738700001602751700002102767700001202788700001602800700001702816700001202833700001702845700001202862700001602874700001402890700001102904700001502915700001702930700002002947773010402967856008503071852000903156655001203165IND60685160120221120163346.0200405e202005  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068516012DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envint.2020.1055932doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFeng, Lingfang10aRibosomal DNA copy number is associated with P53 status and levels of heavy metals in gastrectomy specimens from gastric cancer patients  aThe ribosomal DNA (rDNA) can act as a sensor and responder of cancer-associated stress. Here we investigated rDNA copy number in gastric cancers and its association with existing biomarkers and metals exposure. This study was performed on paired tumor and adjacent normal tissues obtained from 65 gastric cancer patients who underwent gastrectomy. Immunohistochemistry was used to assess HER-2, E-cadherin, EGFR, CK (pan), CK20, CK7, TopoⅡ, CAM5.2, P53, and Ki-67 expression. Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) was used to detect the concentrations of 17 metals in gastric tissues. rDNA copy number was detected by qPCR in genomic DNA isolated from tissue samples. Associations between the expression of existing markers, metal concentrations, and rDNA copy number were evaluated. Within patients with gastric cancer, the copy number of the 45S rDNA components (18S, 5.8S, 28S) and the 5S rDNA in tumor tissues were significantly higher than those in adjacent normal tissues, whereas mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) copy number was significantly lower in tumor tissues than that in adjacent normal tissues. Further analysis revealed that the increase in 18S, 5.8S, and 28S rDNA copy number in tumor tissues was diminished in the context of EGFR and P53 loss. Moreover, analysis of metals revealed particularly high concentrations of As, Cd, Cr, Cu and Fe in the gastric tissues of these patients. Intriguingly, rDNA copy number variation across individuals was correlated with the concentrations of some metals. The rDNA was amplified in tumor tissues of gastric cancer patients, and its amplification may be associated with metals exposure. The expression of EGFR and P53 may influence rDNA copy number, with diminished amplification of the rDNA in cancers that were negative for these biomarkers. Our observation further our understanding of rDNA copy number in gastric cancer and its potential as a simple and useful marker in gastric cancer monitoring.  aPublisher supplied data 3aarsenic 3aatomic absorption spectrometry 3abiomarkers 3acadherins 3acadmium 3achromium 3acopper 3acopy number variation 3aerbB-2 receptor 3aheavy metals 3aimmunohistochemistry 3airon 3amitochondrial DNA 3amonitoring 3apatients 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3aribosomal DNA 3astomach neoplasms 3atissues 0aGastric cancer 0arDNA 0aMarkers 0aMetals 0aCarcinogenesis1 aDu, Jing1 aYao, Chunji1 aJiang, Zhaoqiang1 aLi, Tao1 aZhang, Quan1 aGuo, Xinnian1 aYu, Min1 aXia, Hailing1 aShi, Li1 aJia, Junlin1 aTong, Yan1 aJu, Li1 aLiu, Jiaqi1 aLou, Jianlin1 aLemos, Bernardo0 tEnvironment international.g2020 May, v. 138 p.105593-dElsevier LtdwJournal:6374x0160-41207nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envint.2020.1055933Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03355naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100002600166245015300192300001600345520167900361592002802040650001802068650002702086650002002113650001402133650001002147650001802157650001802175650001702193650001402210650003202224650002302256650001402279650002002293650001702313650001002330650001402340650003702354650004202391650001202433650004202445650001102487650004202498650001102540650001402551650000902565651001202574651001202586700002202598773011202620856004802732852000902780655001202789IND50072026820221117103606.0140118e201401  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007202682DNAL7 a240301032pmid7 a10.1007/s11250-013-0467-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAdesokan, Hezekiah K.10aKnowledge, attitudes and practices of traceability among livestock traders in south-western Nigeria: implications for sustainable livestock industry  ap. 159-165.  aLivestock diseases and other animal health events are a threat to achieving sustainable livestock industry. The knowledge of trace-back and the practice of providing feedback on diseases encountered in slaughtered animals from the abattoir to the farm can help limit the spread as well as manage potential future incidents of such diseases. We assessed the knowledge, attitudes and practices of 200 willing livestock traders on traceability in Bodija Municipal Abattoir, south-western Nigeria. The results reveal that the majority of these traders had poor knowledge (79.5 %) and practices (74.0 %) of traceability, though 89.5 % demonstrated good attitudes. While 22.9 % knew that traceability could be an effective means to control diseases, only a lower proportion (9.0 %) knew the health status of the animals being purchased. Though 29.0 % reported the diseases encountered in their animals during slaughter to the farm, only 9.5 % followed up to ensure the farmers take steps at preventing further occurrence of the reported diseases. While age (p = 0.000; 0.014) and education (p = 0.000; 0.000) were both significant for good knowledge and attitudes, frequency of condemned cases (p = 0.000) and length of years in the trade (p = 0.004) were, respectively, significant for good knowledge and attitudes with none associated with practice. These poor levels of knowledge and practices of traceability are a threat to sustainable livestock industry, food security and human health; hence, there is an urgent need to institute national feedback mechanism on slaughtered animals in order to strengthen interventions against diseases at farm levels.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal health 3aattitudes and opinions 3adisease control 3aeducation 3afarms 3afood security 3ahealth status 3ahuman health 3alivestock 3alivestock and meat industry 3alivestock diseases 3aslaughter 3aslaughterhouses 3atraceability 3atrade 2aAbattoirs 2aAgriculturexeconomicsxmethods. 2aAnimal Diseasesxprevention & control 2aAnimals 2aCommunicable Disease Controlxmethods 2aFemale 2aHealth Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice 2aHumans 2aLivestock 2aMale 3aNigeria 0aNigeria1 aOcheja, Samuel E.0 tTropical animal health and production.g2014 Jan., v. 46, no. 1 p.159-165dSpringer-Verlagx0049-47477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11250-013-0467-3  aDNAL 7aarticle03329naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245012200169300001600291520189400307592002802201650002502229650001202254650001202266650001702278650001802295650001202313650001302325650002402338650001502362650001702377650001402394650002002408650001802428650002302446651001002469653002102479653003102500653002802531653002402559653001902583700001802602700001702620700001702637773008702654856008502741852000902826655001202835IND60593517620221120142453.0190403e201703  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059351762DNAL7 a10.1016/j.catena.2016.11.0172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGuan, Fengying10aSpatial variability of soil nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium contents in Moso bamboo forests in Yong'an City, China  ap. 161-172.  aBamboo is an important forest type in Southern China, covering an area of 6.16 million ha, >70% of which is Moso bamboo (Phyllostachys heterocycla (Carr.) Mitford cv. Pubescens) forest. Moso bamboo forests are characterized by fast growth and high nutrient dynamics due to the annual timber harvest, and thus a high nutrient input is required compared with other forest types. Soil nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P) and potassium (K) are important micronutrients for plant growth and productivity. Because of the high spatial and temporal variability of soil, information on the spatial distribution of N, P and K contents in Moso bamboo forests is very limited, although this information is important for improving soil nutrient management. Therefore, in this study, soil samples at 0–20, 20–40 and 40–60cm were taken from 138 locations in Moso bamboo forests across the study area. The N, P and K contents of different soil layers ranged from 1.01 to 4.11gkg−1, from 0.025 to 0.131gkg−1 and from 0.42 to 5.40gkg−1, respectively. The coefficient of variation of N, P and K contents ranged from 26% to 43%, suggesting a moderate variability. Ordinary kriging (OK) and inverse distance weighting (IDW) approaches were applied to analyse the spatial patterns of N, P and K contents. Geostatistical analysis showed a moderate spatial dependence of N, P and K contents, indicating that N, P and K contents were controlled by both intrinsic and extrinsic factors. Cross-validation illustrated that OK performed better than IDW. OK and IDW showed a similar spatial pattern of N, P and K contents over the whole study area, demonstrating the suitability of OK and IDW in spatial interpolation. However, OK produced a smaller range of predicted N, P and K contents than IDW, highlighting the necessity of using different approaches when studying the spatial distribution of soil properties.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPhyllostachys edulis 3abamboos 3acatenas 3aforest types 3ageostatistics 3akriging 3anitrogen 3anutrient management 3aphosphorus 3aplant growth 3apotassium 3asoil properties 3asoil sampling 3atemporal variation 3aChina 0aOrdinary kriging 0aInverse distance weighting 0aGeostatistical analysis 0aSpatial variability 0aSoil nutrients1 aXia, Mingpeng1 aTang, Xiaolu1 aFan, Shaohui0 tCatena.g2017 Mar., v. 150 p.161-172dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6271x0341-81627nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.catena.2016.11.0173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02768naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245014300165500002200308520112600330592002801456650001901484650002201503650005001525650001001575650003401585650001401619650001701633650001901650650000901669650002001678653000801698653001601706653002201722653002101744653001601765653001801781653000801799653000801807653000701815653000701822653000701829653000701836653000801843653000801851653000701859653000801866653000701874653000701881700001501888700001401903700001601917700001401933700001401947700001401961700001401975773008301989856004902072852000902121655001202130IND60795515020221123005444.0221004e20220915xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079551502DNAL7 a10.1016/j.gene.2022.1469052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShi, Bozhang10aGenome-wide analysis of the CSN genes in land plants and their expression under various abiotic stress and phytohormone conditions in rice  aPre-press version  aThe CONSTITUTIVE PHOTOMORPHOGENIC9 (COP9) signalosome (CSN) is a multi-functional protein complex, which is involved in plant growth and abiotic stress response. However, the evolution and function of the CSN genes in land plants are still largely unclear. Here, we have identified 124 CSN genes and constructed phylogenetic trees of these CSN proteins to elucidate their feature and evolution in twelve land plants. Analysis of gene structure, protein property and protein motif composition shows the evolutional conservation and variation of the CSN proteins in land plants. These CSN genes might evolve through whole genome duplication (WGD)/segmental duplication (SD) and tandem duplication (TD). Analysis of promoter cis-elements shows that the CSN genes are implicated in diverse biological processes and different signaling pathways. RT-qPCR indicates that the transcript abundance of the OsCSN genes is up-regulated or down-regulated in response to abiotic stress and treatment with various hormones in rice. These results provide new insights into the CSN gene evolution and its possible function in land plants.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabiotic stress 3aamino acid motifs 3aconstitutive photomorphogenesis 9 signalosome 3agenes 3agenome-wide association study 3aphylogeny 3aplant growth 3aplant hormones 3arice 3astress response 0aCSN 0aLand plants 0aPhylogenetic tree 0aGene duplication 0aCis-element 0aPhytohormones 0aCSN 0aWGD 0aSD 0aTD 0aKa 0aKs 0aABA 0aIAA 0aSA 0aACC 0aGA 0aJA1 aHou, Jiaqi1 aYang, Jin1 aHan, Il-Jin1 aTu, Daoyi1 aYe, Shiqi1 aYu, Jinfu1 aLi, Lijia0 tGene.g2022 Sept. 15,  p.146905-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6378x0378-11197nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gene.2022.146905  aDNAL 7aarticle01894naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002100151245013200172300001600304520069400320592002801014650001401042650002901056650001501085650002401100650003101124650002001155653002001175653002401195653002401219653003201243653002101275700002101296773012101317856008501438852000901523655001201532IND60579998120221120220352.0170907e20170703xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057999812DNAL7 a10.1080/10590501.2017.13288442doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKrishnan, Kannan12aA decision tree approach to screen drinking water contaminants for multiroute exposure potential in developing guideline values  ap. 173-187.  aThe consideration of inhalation and dermal routes of exposures in developing guideline values for drinking water contaminants is important.

Here, side-chain sulfonated poly(ether ether ketone) (SPEEK) was synthesized and prepared the poly(ether ether ketone) (PEEK) - SPEEK nanofiltration (NF) membrane by a simple dipping coating and heat treatment. Single component filtration tests of the optimized membrane showed ultrahigh pure water flux (126 Lm⁻² h⁻¹ bar⁻¹) and relatively low NaCl rejection (6.7%). Moreover, the negatively charged membrane exhibited excellent rejection of 98.8% toward Congo red (CR). The pure water flux was about 9 folds than that of commercial NF270 with comparable solutes rejection. The separation tests of CR and NaCl mixed solution at optimized conditions exhibited ultra-high permeation flux (34 Lm⁻² h⁻¹ bar⁻¹), satisfactory dye (98.8%)/salt (< 10%) rejection and the separation performance remained stable after 10 cycles. Finally, the contaminated membrane was washed with ethanol, the permeation flux and the CR rejection remained constant after several cycles, while the commercial NF1 membrane exhibited serious swelling only within one cycle. The prepared membrane exhibited good organic solvents resistance and antifouling properties. Thus, this work confirmed the PEEK-SPEEK NF membrane showed great potential in the sustainable treatment of textile wastewater.  aPublisher supplied data 3adyes 3aethanol 3aheat treatment 3aindustry 3ananofiltration 3apermeability 3atextile mill effluents 0aDye/salt separation 0aTextile wastewater 0aUltrahigh permeation flux 0aOrganic solvents resistant1 aYue, Cheng1 aLin, Allison Tzu Yu,1 aLi, Wenying1 aZhang, Haibo1 aPang, Jinhui1 aJiang, Zhenhua0 tJournal of hazardous materials.g2021 July 15, v. 414 p.125489-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6200x0304-38947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2021.1254893Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02401naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245009000166300001800256520116400274592002801438650001901466650001201485650001801497650001601515650001401531650001301545650001901558650001901577650001901596650001101615650002101626650001901647650001101666700001901677700002501696700001201721700001801733700001501751773011101766856008101877852000901958655001201967IND60580785020221122075427.0171001e201710  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058078502DNAL7 a10.1007/s12649-016-9783-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Yuanzhen10aPreparation of Photocatalytic Zn3(VO4)2/ZnWO4 from Waste V2O5–WO3/TiO2 SCR Catalyst  ap. 2423-2430.  aIn this paper, a new photocatalyst Zn₃(VO₄)₂/ZnWO₄ is synthesized via a hydrothermal-sintering process from waste V₂O₅–WO₃/TiO₂ catalysts based on sustainable perspectives. The waste V₂O₅–WO₃/TiO₂ catalyst is leached by sodium hydroxide solution in addition of Na₃PO₄·12H₂O. Target compositions, 96.5% of V₂O₅, 60.3% of WO₃, and impurities such as CaO, SiO₂, Al₂O₃ are dissolved in solution. Before vanadate and tungstate in leaching solution used to prepare Zn₃(VO₄)₂/ZnWO₄, the leachate is purified by selective precipitation to remove Ca²⁺, AlO₂ ⁻ and SiO₃ ²⁻. Afterward, Zn₃(VO₄)₂/ZnWO₄, which can be used as photocatalyst is prepared through a hydrothermal process at 180 °C and a sintering process at 680 °C. The photocatalytic activities of the prepared samples are examined by studying the degradation of methylene blue under visible-light irradiation. Results show that the Zn₃(VO₄)₂/ZnWO₄ composite exhibits a good photocatalytic activity within the range of visible light, which possibly owes to the heterojunction structure between Zn₃(VO₄)₂ and ZnWO₄.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaluminum oxide 3acalcium 3acalcium oxide 3airradiation 3aleachates 3aleaching 3amethylene blue 3aphotocatalysis 3aphotocatalysts 3asilica 3asodium hydroxide 3atungsten oxide 3awastes1 aChang, Zhidong1 aBlamo, Benjamin John1 aWu, Xue1 aLiu, Shixiang1 aLi, Wenjun0 tWaste and biomass valorization.g2017 Oct., v. 8, no. 7 p.2423-2430dSpringer Netherlandsx1877-26417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12649-016-9783-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02993naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001400148245012900162300002000291520154500311592002801856596005901884596005901943596005902002596008102061596009702142650001102239650002402250650001302274650001402287650002402301700001402325700005202339700001202391773012502403856008202528852000902610655001202619IND60744224320221118053236.0210710e202109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074422432DNAL7 a10.1007/s10853-021-06258-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, X. W.10aMagnetic and compressive properties of ternary Ni–Fe–Ti eutectic alloy processed by electromagnetic levitation technique  ap. 15407-15422.  aThe magnetic and compressive properties of the ternary Ni₄₀.₆Fe₃₆.₄Ti₂₃ eutectic alloys solidified under electromagnetic levitation condition were investigated. An undercooling range from 32 to 141 K was achieved, and a ternary eutectic consisting of a fibrous Fe₂Ti phase and lamellar γ-Fe(Ni) + Ni₃Ti phases formed. In the ternary eutectic, the γ-Fe(Ni) and Ni₃Ti phases kept cooperative growth, while the Fe₂Ti phase grew either cooperatively with these two phases or sometimes independently. Theoretical calculations showed that there existed a vertical flow field and temperature gradient in the center of the levitated alloy droplet, contributing to the directional growth behavior of eutectic grain. The growth velocity of primary Ni₃Ti dendrite increased by 2.4 times, while that of ternary eutectic increased by 77% as undercooling rose, and consequently, the microstructures were significantly refined. The temperature stability of coercivity and residual magnetization below ambient temperature was improved once alloy undercooling reached 128 K, ascribed to the enhancement of the exchange coupling effect between the magnetic domains inside refined grains. The fracture strain of the ternary eutectic alloy increased with undercooling because microcrack propagation was further hindered and the plastic deformation was more homogeneous. Meanwhile, the fracture was dominated by transgranular (TG) mode at an undercooling of 132 K because the bonding force of grain boundaries became stronger.  aPublisher supplied data  aU1806219cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a52073232cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a52088101cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a2020JC-11cScience Fund for Distinguished Young Scholars of Shaanxi Province  a2021TD-14cScience Fund for Scientific and Technological Innovation Team of Shaanxi Province 3aalloys 3aambient temperature 3adroplets 3amagnetism 3aplastic deformation1 aWu, B.

The high atherosclerotic risk in dyslipidemic patients is associated with endothelial dysfunction. During the last two decades, novel bioactive peptides have emerged as potential biomarkers of endothelial dysfunction and dyslipidemia-salusins and adropin. Salusin-alpha is likely to prevent atherosclerosis, while salusin-beta may act as a potential proatherogenic factor. Adropin was recently identified as important for energy homeostasis and lipid metabolism. Adropin is closely related to the inhibition of atherosclerosis by up-regulation of the endothelial nitric oxide synthase expression through the vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2. These peptides represent a novel target to limit diseases characterized by endothelial dysfunction and may form the basis for the development of new therapeutic agents for treating metabolic disorders associated with atherosclerosis.  aPublisher supplied data 0aAdropin 0aAtherosclerosis 0aDyslipidemia 0aEndothelium 0aSalusin-alpha 0aSalusin-beta1 aGrzegorzewska, Alicja E.0 tAdvances in Medical Sciences.g2016 Sept., v. 61 p.282-287dElsevier Urban & Partner Sp. z o.o.aMedical University of Bialystokx1896-11267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.advms.2016.03.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03673naa a2200697 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003800113040001800151100002600169245010000195300001600295520143300311592002801744650001801772650001901790650001401809650002601823650002001849650001001869650001701879650001201896650001201908650001201920650001701932650001201949650002201961650000901983650001901992650002202011650005702033650001202090650004902102650002802151650007402179650002002253650001102273650006302284650000902347650001402356650006102370650007102431650002202502650000902524650001702533700002802550700002202578700002102600700002402621700002402645700002502669700002402694700001802718773011102736856008402847990002302931852000902954655001202963IND60097869920221118063822.0141104e20120815xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009786992DNAL7 a226524292pmid7 a10.1016/j.ejphar.2012.05.0242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCorrea-Costa, Matheus10aInflammatory milieu as an early marker of kidney injury in offspring rats from diabetic mothers  ap. 233-240.  aThe present study investigated the early presence of inflammatory response in renal tissue of young offspring from diabetic mothers. The effect of l-arginine (l-arg) supplementation was also investigated. The offspring was divided into four groups: group CO (controls); group DO (diabetic offspring); group CA (CO receiving 2% l-arg solution) and group DA (DO receiving the 2% l-arg solution). Glycemia, arterial pressure and renal function were evaluated; gene and protein expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines were also measured. Blood pressure levels were significantly increased in 2 and 6 month-old DO rats, whereas l-arg administration caused a significant decrease in the DA group, at both ages. DO rats showed a significantly blunted glycemic response to exogenous insulin. In 2 month-old DO animals, renal protein expression of pro-inflammatory molecules was significantly increased. At six months of age, we also observed an increase in gene expression of pro-inflammatory molecules, whereas l-arg supplementation prevented this increase at both ages. Our data suggest that activation of inflammatory pathways is present early in the kidney of DO rats, and that l-arg can attenuate the expression of these markers of tissue inflammation. Our results also reinforce the concept that intrauterine environmental factors are a fundamental determinant in the development of metabolic and vascular diseases later in life.  aPublisher supplied data 3ablood glucose 3ablood pressure 3acytokines 3aenvironmental factors 3agene expression 3agenes 3ainflammation 3ainsulin 3akidneys 3amothers 3apharmacology 3aprogeny 3aprotein synthesis 3arats 3arenal function 3avascular diseases 2aAcute Kidney Injuryxdiagnosisxetiologyxpathology. 2aAnimals 2aArgininexadministration & dosagextoxicity. 2aBiomarkersxmetabolism. 2aDiabetes Mellitus, Experimentalxcomplicationsxdiagnosisxpathology. 2aEarly Diagnosis 2aFemale 2aInflammation Mediatorsxadministration & dosagextoxicity. 2aMale 2aPregnancy 2aPregnancy Complicationsxdiagnosisxetiologyxpathology. 2aPrenatal Exposure Delayed Effectsxdiagnosisxetiologyxpathology. 2aRandom Allocation 2aRats 2aRats, Wistar1 aLandgraf, Maristella A.1 aCavanal, Maria F.1 aSemedo, Patricia1 aVieira, Daniel A.G.1 aDe Marco, Davi T.K.1 aHirata, Aparecida E.1 aCâmara, Niels O.S.1 aGil, Frida Z.0 tEuropean journal of pharmacology.g2012 Aug. 15, v. 689, no. 1-3 p.233-240dElsevier B.V.x0014-29997nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ejphar.2012.05.0243Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03543naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005900148245010200207300001600309520212500325592002802450650001702478650002302495650001502518650001202533650001002545650001002555650001202565650001302577650001502590650001702605650002202622650001002644650001602654651001002670653000902680653001702689653001602706653001502722653001002737653001502747653001002762653001002772700002402782700002102806773011802827856008302945852000903028655001203037IND60111949620221118010722.0190411e201312  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011194962DNAL7 a10.1016/j.baae.2013.10.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNorfolk, Olivia1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2909-304X10aTraditional agricultural gardens conserve wild plants and functional richness in arid South Sinai  ap. 659-669.  aMaintaining agricultural diversity is important for the conservation of rare species and for preserving underlying ecosystem processes on which smallholder farmers rely. The positive effects of crop diversity are well documented in tropical systems, but the conservation potential of arid agricultural systems is less clear. This study assesses the impact of three arid agroforestry systems on plant diversity and functional richness in South Sinai, Egypt: (1) mountain orchard gardens, (2) modern town gardens and (3) low desert date-palm gardens. We surveyed plants (cultivated and wild) within gardens and control plots of natural habitat and allocated each plant eight biological traits that are recognised as being linked with major ecosystem processes. Species diversity was quantified using three measures (Hill's numbers) and total species diversity was significantly higher within gardens than in the surrounding habitat at all three levels of diversity and across the three agroforestry systems. Species similarity was high between gardens and the surrounding habitat, and there was a strong overlap in the functional traits of wild plants and cultivated non-tree species. Despite the clear presence of trees within the gardens, the community weighted trait means (CWMs) showed that chamaephyte perennials were the dominant life-forms in both the gardens and the natural habitat. Functional richness differed between the three agroforestry systems, but was significantly higher within the gardens. Functional richness has been linked to increased productivity and CWMs showed that plants within the gardens were considerably taller than outside, suggesting higher biomass accumulation. These findings suggest that Bedouin agricultural practices are not having a negative effect on the flora of the region and that the continuation of these indigenous farming practices can actively benefit rare wild plants in the region. On a wider scale, this study supports the view that smallholder farms and homegardens can be valuable tools in conservation, preserving local species and maintaining ecosystem functioning.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagroforestry 3abiomass production 3aecosystems 3afarmers 3afarms 3aflora 3agardens 3ahabitats 3aperennials 3arare species 3aspecies diversity 3atrees 3awild plants 3aEgypt 0aArid 0aAgroforestry 0aAgriculture 0aHomegarden 0aEgypt 0aFunctional 0aPlant 0aTrait1 aEichhorn, Markus P.1 aGilbert, Francis0 tBasic and applied ecology.g2013 Dec., v. 14, no. 8 p.659-669dElsevier GmbHwJournal:jnl3925117x1439-17917nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.baae.2013.10.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04881naa a2201441 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002600148245013300174520180900307592002802116650000802144650002602152650001902178650002002197650001402217650002002231650001002251650004002261650001502301650002002316650002802336650001102364650001802375653002102393653001002414653002002424653001002444653001802454653000802472653000802480653000802488653001402496653001402510653000802524653000802532653001002540653000802550653000902558653000702567653000802574653000902582653000902591653000802600653000802608653000902616653000802625653000902633653000702642653000802649653000702657653001302664653000802677653000802685653000702693653001002700653000702710653001102717653000902728653001102737653000802748653000802756653001002764653000802774653000902782653001202791653000802803653001102811653000702822653001002829653001102839653000802850653000702858653000802865653000702873653000802880653000802888653000902896653000902905653000802914653000802922653000802930653001102938653000902949653001002958653001102968653001102979653001102990653000903001653000903010653001203019653000803031653000803039653000903047653000903056653001003065653001003075653000703085653001303092653000803105653000903113653001103122653001203133653001103145653000903156653000803165653000903173653000803182653000703190653000903197653000803206653000703214700001703221700001903238700002403257773008803281856004903369852000903418655001203427IND60795515120221123005510.0221004e20230115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079551512DNAL7 a10.1016/j.gene.2022.1469192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChattopadhyay, Trisha10aGenome-wide profiling of dysregulated piRNAs and their target genes implicated in oncogenicity of tongue squamous cell carcinoma  aPIWI-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) are single-stranded, 23–36 nucleotide long RNAs that regulate gene expression in the germline but are also detected in some cancers. However, there are no reports yet on piRNA expression in tongue squamous cell carcinoma (TSCC), the most common oral cancer (80–90% percent of all oral cancers). We performed small RNA and whole transcriptome sequencing in H357 tongue cancer and HOK cells (GEO database accession numbers: GSE196674 and GSE196688). We also examined nine published sets of gene expression array data of TSCC tissues from the GEO database to decode piRNAs and their putative targets that may be involved in tumorigenesis. We identified a pool of 16,058 and 25,677 piRNAs in H357 and HOK, respectively, among which 406 are differentially expressed. We also found that 2094 protein-coding genes are differentially expressed in either TSCC tissues or cell lines. We performed target predictions for these piRNAs, pathway and disease function (DF) analyses, as well as qRT-PCR validation of piRNA-target pairs. These experiments revealed one up-regulated (FDFT1) and four down-regulated (OGA, BDH1, TAT, HYAL4) target genes that are enriched in 11 canonical pathways (CPs), with postulated roles in the initiation and progression of TSCC. Downregulation of piR-33422 is predicted to upregulate the FDFT1 gene, which encodes a mevalonate/cholesterol-pathway related farnesyl-diphosphate farnesyltransferase. The FDFT1 appears to be involved in the largest number of oncogenesis-related processes and is interacting with statins, which is a classical cancer drug. This study provides the first evidence of the piRNome of TSCC, which could be investigated further to decode piRNA-mediated gene regulations in malignancy and potential drug targets, such as FDFT1.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRNA 3aantineoplastic agents 3acarcinogenesis 3acarcinogenicity 3adatabases 3agene expression 3agenes 3ageranylgeranyl diphosphate synthase 3agerm cells 3amouth neoplasms 3asquamous cell carcinoma 3atongue 3atranscriptome 0aGene regulations 0aFDFT1 0aNon-coding RNAs 0apiRNA 0aTongue cancer 0aµM 0aµg 0aµl 0a3′-5′ 0a5′-3′ 0aAEC 0aAlu 0aANOVA 0aBCA 0aBDH1 0abp 0aBSA 0aCD44 0acDNA 0aCDS 0aCPs 0aCPSS 0aCRC 0aDAPI 0aDE 0aDEG 0aDF 0aDMEM-F12 0aEMT 0aFBS 0aFC 0aFDFT1 0aGO 0aGRCh37 0ahg19 0aHISAT2 0aHOK 0aHRP 0aHYAL4 0aJAK 0aLINE 0alncRNAs 0aLTR 0amiRNAs 0aMM 0amRNAs 0ancRNAs 0aNEB 0ang 0aNGS 0anM 0ants 0aOGA 0aOSCC 0aPARP 0aPBS 0aPCG 0aPCR 0apiRNAs 0aPIWI 0aPIWIL 0aPIWIL1 0aPIWIL2 0aPIWIL4 0aPKM2 0aPVDF 0aqRT-PCR 0aRCC 0aRIN 0aRIPA 0aRNAi 0aRPL13 0arRNAs 0aRT 0aSDS-PAGE 0aSEM 0aSINE 0asiRNAs 0asnoRNAs 0asnRNAs 0aSTAT 0aTAT 0aTBST 0aTCA 0aTE 0aTSCC 0aUTR 0aWB1 aGupta, Pooja1 aNayak, Rojalin1 aMallick, Bibekanand0 tGene.g2023 Jan. 15, v. 849 p.146919-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6378x0378-11197nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gene.2022.146919  aDNAL 7aarticle02592naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002400149245011500173300001600288520133600304592002801640653002101668653002501689653003101714700001801745700001801763700002201781700002101803700002901824700003401853700002101887700002201908700002401930700002201954773015001976856008302126852000902209655001202218IND60554764420221119005525.0161103e201609  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055476442DNAL7 a10.1016/j.advms.2016.03.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWoźniak, Grzegorz,10aCell-cycle gene expression analysis using real time PCR in locally advanced squamous-cell head and neck cancer  ap. 293-299.  aThe analysis of gene expression, especially those involved in cell cycle control, can help to discover mechanisms determining the outcome of radiation treatment. The main purpose of this study was to examine the expression level of genes responsible for cell cycle regulation in samples of the head and neck cancer, obtained during surgery.Postsurgical samples of SCC of head and neck region were collected. Over 80 genes were analysed using cell cycle quantitative real-time RT-PCR Array method. Presence of 14 high-risk HPV types DNA in frozen or paraffin-embedded tumour pathological samples was also assessed. To correlate gene expression with selected pathological features and clinical outcome we used different hierarchical clustering method.Hierarchical clustering demonstrated the association between gene expression within certain clusters and gender, tumour site, T stage, N stage, grade, pathological subtype or tumour recurrence.Despite some limitations we were able to identify gene clusters that allowed to classify patients according to selected clinical features and occurrence of tumour recurrence. The results of the analysis also confirm that the incidence of HPV infection among the patients from Upper Silesia is relatively low, whereas HPV negative tumours, likely associated with smoking, appeared dominant.  aPublisher supplied data 0aCell cycle genes 0aHead and neck cancer 0aQuantitative real-time PCR1 aHerok, Robert1 aJaksik, Roman1 aMisiołek, Maciej1 aKolebacz, Bogdan1 aFiszer-Kierzkowska, Anna1 aMiśkiewicz-Orczyk, Katarzyna1 aSzymczyk, Cezary1 aMaciejewski, Adam1 aGłowacki, Grzegorz1 aSuwiński, Rafał0 tAdvances in Medical Sciences.g2016 Sept., v. 61 p.293-299dElsevier Urban & Partner Sp. z o.o.aMedical University of Bialystokx1896-11267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.advms.2016.03.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04175naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003800113040001800151100002200169245019200191300001600383520187500399592002802274650003302302650002402335650002102359650003102380650001302411650002702424650001402451650002102465650001802486650003602504650001702540650002302557650002202580650001302602650004302615650005202658650003602710650001802746650003202764650004602796650001202842650001402854650008202868650006402950650000903014650002403023650007703047650007403124650006903198700001803267700001803285700001903303773011103322856008403433990002303517852000903540655001203549IND60097870020221118062623.0141104e20120815xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009787002DNAL7 a226838702pmid7 a10.1016/j.ejphar.2012.05.0332doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCheng, Hsueh-Ling10aEMCD, a hypoglycemic triterpene isolated from Momordica charantia wild variant, attenuates TNF-α-induced inflammation in FL83B cells in an AMP-activated protein kinase-independent manner  ap. 241-248.  aInsulin resistance is a causative factor for type 2 diabetes, whereas the development of insulin resistance is closely related to chronic inflammation induced by factors such as tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α). Momordica charantia, also known as bitter melon, has been used as an herbal medicine and reported to ameliorate inflammation and hyperglycemia. Previously, a triterpene 5β,19-epoxy-25-methoxy-cucurbita-6,23-diene-3β,19-diol (EMCD), purified from M. charantia L. wild variant WB24, was found to activate AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and have a hypoglycaemic effect in TNF-α-treated FL83B cells. AMPK has been a target for developing anti-diabetic medicine and suggested to play a role in anti-inflammation. The current study aims to investigate if EMCD might repress TNF-α-induced inflammation via AMPK. TNF-α-induced inflammation in FL83B cells was characterized using Western blotting and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. Consequently, the expression of inflammatory markers including inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), the p65 subunit of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB), protein-tyrosine phosphatase-1B, TNF-α and interleukin-1β were significantly elevated by TNF-α in the cell, and EMCD obviously suppressed the TNF-α-induced expression of these markers. When the effect of EMCD was tested simultaneously with epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), a catechin from green tea reported to be anti-inflammatory, EMCD showed a more obvious anti-inflammatory activity than EGCG did. Investigation of the underlying mechanism suggested that EMCD inhibited the activation of the IκB kinase (IKK) complex and the NF-κB pathway, and the effect was likely independent of AMPK. Collectively, the multiple functions of EMCD suggest it to be a potential agent in treating diabetic complications and other inflammation-related disorders.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAMP-activated protein kinase 3aMomordica charantia 3aWestern blotting 3aanti-inflammatory activity 3acatechin 3adiabetic complications 3agreen tea 3aherbal medicines 3ahyperglycemia 3ainducible nitric oxide synthase 3ainflammation 3ainsulin resistance 3ainterleukin-1beta 3amedicine 3anoninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3atranscription factor NF-kappa B 3atriterpenoids 3atumor necrosis factor-alpha 2aAMP-Activated Protein Kinasesxphysiology 2aAnimals 2aCell Line 2aHypoglycemic Agentsxisolation & purificationxpharmacologyxtherapeutic use. 2aInflammation Mediatorsxantagonists & inhibitorsxtoxicity. 2aMice 2aMomordica charantia 2aPlant Extractsxisolation & purificationxpharmacologyxtherapeutic use. 2aTriterpenesxisolation & purificationxpharmacologyxtherapeutic use. 2aTumor Necrosis Factor-alphaxantagonists & inhibitorsxtoxicity.1 aKuo, Ching-Yi1 aLiao, Yun-Wen1 aLin, Chen-Chen0 tEuropean journal of pharmacology.g2012 Aug. 15, v. 689, no. 1-3 p.241-248dElsevier B.V.x0014-29997nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ejphar.2012.05.0333Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02231naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245010400166300001600270520081500286592002801101650002301129650001401152650001801166650001101184650002101195650001901216650001401235650002001249650002201269650002401291650001801315653001701333653000801350653000901358653001401367653001401381700002001395700001401415700002001429700001801449700001901467700002001486700001901506773012101525856008201646852000901728655001201737IND60533056920221117184854.0160728e20140829xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053305692DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbrc.2014.08.0182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWoo, Seon Min10aAxl is a novel target of withaferin A in the induction of apoptosis and the suppression of invasion  ap. 455-460.  aWithaferin A, a withanolide derived from the medicinal plant Withania somnifera, has been reported to exhibit anti-tumorigenic activity against various cancer cells. In this study, we show that withaferin A inhibits the constitutive and recombinant human growth-arrest-specific protein 6 (rhGas6)-induced phosphorylation of Axl and STAT3. In addition, withaferin A also induces the down-regulation of Axl protein expression in a lysosome-dependent manner and inhibits rhGas6-induced wound healing and cell migration. Furthermore, the overexpression of Axl attenuates withaferin A-induced apoptosis. Taken together, the data from the present study indicate that the withaferin A-mediated down-regulation of the Gas6/Axl signaling pathway mediates the inhibition of cell migration and the induction of apoptosis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aWithania somnifera 3aapoptosis 3acell movement 3ahumans 3amedicinal plants 3aneoplasm cells 3aneoplasms 3aphosphorylation 3aprotein synthesis 3asignal transduction 3atissue repair 0aWithaferin A 0aAxl 0aGas6 0aMigration 0aApoptosis1 aMin, Kyoung-jin1 aKim, Shin1 aPark, Jong-Wook1 aKim, Dong Eun1 aKim, Sang Hyun1 aChoi, Yung Hyun1 aKwon, Taeg Kyu0 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2014 Aug. 29, v. 451 p.455-460dElsevier Inc.x0006-291X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2014.08.0183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02610naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001600148245013000164520113900294592002801433650002401461650001001485650002401495650002201519650002301541650001501564650001801579650001101597650002701608650002601635653001201661653002101673653000901694653001001703653000801713653000801721653000901729653000801738653000801746653000901754653000901763653001001772653001101782653001401793653001201807700001501819700001801834700001501852700001501867700001601882773008801898856004901986852000902035655001202044IND60795515220221123005449.0221004e20230120xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079551522DNAL7 a10.1016/j.gene.2022.1469222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPeng, Bohao12aA novel Dmrt gene of crustacean: Functional analysis of idmrt-2 gene in the male reproductive system from Scylla paramamosain  aThe Dmrt (double-sex and mab-3 related transcription factor) gene family is considered to be a highly conserved gene family related to sex determination and sexual differentiation across species. In order to better understand the role of the idmrt-2 gene in gonad development in Scylla paramamosain, the idmrt-2 gene was cloned and analyzed. The cDNA contains a 1659 bp ORF region encoding 552 amino acids. The qRT-PCR results showed that idmrt-2 was significantly more expressed in the testis than in other tissues (p < 0.05). The expression of idmrt-2 was highest in the spermatids stage (T2 stage), followed by the mature sperms stage (T3 stage) and significantly higher than in the spermatocytes stage (T1 stage) (p < 0.05) during testicular development and the expression difference was not significant in different stages of ovarian development. RNAi studies revealed that after idmrt-2 was knocked down, the expression of Dmrt-like and foxl-2 genes in the testis decreased, as well as IAG expression in the androgenic gland. The findings suggest that idmrt-2 may be an IAG regulator and involved in testicular development.  aPublisher supplied data 3aScylla paramamosain 3agenes 3aovarian development 3asex determination 3asexual development 3aspermatids 3aspermatocytes 3atestes 3atesticular development 3atranscription factors 0aidmrt-2 0aRNA interference 0aDmrt 0aidmrt 0aIAG 0aGSI 0acDNA 0aORF 0aUTR 0aEGFP 0aRNAi 0adsRNA 0adsEGFP 0adsidmrt-2 0aqRT-PCR1 aWan, Haifu1 aZhang, Ziping1 aJia, Xiwei1 aLiu, Chang1 aWang, Yilei0 tGene.g2023 Jan. 20, v. 850 p.146922-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6378x0378-11197nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gene.2022.146922  aDNAL 7aarticle03404naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002500148245008500173300001600258520208200274592002802356650001202384650001302396650001302409650001202422650001502434650001702449650001502466650000902481650001002490653003202500653002502532653001602557653001402573653003102587700001502618700001502633700001502648700001702663700001302680700001402693773014702707856008302854852000902937655001202946IND60111949820221118010737.0190411e201312  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011194982DNAL7 a10.1016/j.baae.2013.09.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTsegai, Awet Tekeste10aEffects of spatial distribution on plant associational defense against herbivory  ap. 680-686.  aSeveral studies have shown that consumption of a focal plant by herbivores depends not only on its own defense traits but also on the characteristics of the neighboring plants. A number of studies have reported on plant associational defense in relation to neighboring plant palatability but the effect of the spatial distribution of the focal plant within patches of different neighboring plants has received less attention. We conducted a manipulative experiment to determine whether and how spatial distribution of focal plants affects the associational defense between plant species. In our experimental setup sheep encountered two patches varying in spatial distribution of the focal plant within patches (dispersed or clumped) and patch quality, good patch and bad patch, where the focal plant, Lathyrus quinquenervius, was neighbored to high- (Chloris virgata) or low-palatable (Kalimeris integrifolia) species, respectively. Results showed that, when focal plants were dispersed within both patches, the risk of attack was significantly lower for focal plants in the patches with low- than high-palatable neighbors, indicating associational defense. Alternatively, when focal plants were clumped within both patches, they were consumed in bad-patch as much as in good-patch plots, which indicates the absence of associational defense. However, if the focal plants have different spatial distributions in the two patches (dispersed in good-patch and clumped in bad-patch or vice versa), sheep foraging success for focal plants was greatly reduced in dispersed spatial pattern irrespective of the palatability of neighboring plants. Therefore, we concluded that spatial distribution is as important as traits of neighboring plants in predicting vulnerability of the focal plant to grazing by generalist herbivores. The outcome of plant associational defense for different types of neighborhood strongly depends on the magnitude of herbivore foraging selectivity between and within patches, which further depended on the contrasts between plant species or between patches.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChloris 3aLathyrus 3aforaging 3agrazing 3aherbivores 3apalatability 3aprediction 3arisk 3asheep 0aAssociational plant defense 0aSpatial distribution 0aSelectivity 0aHerbivory 0aNeighboring plant contrast1 aWang, Ling1 aWang, Deli1 aHuang, Yue1 aLin, Haijiao1 aLi, Jing1 aLiu, Chen0 tBasic and applied ecology.g2013 Dec., v. 14, no. 8 p.680-686dElsevier GmbHaGesellschaft für ÖkologiewJournal:jnl3925117x1439-17917nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.baae.2013.09.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01619naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002100150245009800171520047700269592002800746650001100774650002400785650001200809653001500821653002800836653001400864653002100878653002100899700002600920700002000946700001900966700002400985700001601009700002201025773010401047856008501151852000901236655001201245IND60791525820221119012831.0220929e20220928xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079152582DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tetlet.2022.1541012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPrudhvi Raju, N.10aBF3*OEt2 catalyzed synthesis of spiropyrrolidine frameworks via (3,5)-oxonium-ene cyclization  aγ-Hydroxyolefin derived from proline undergoes a smooth ene cyclization with aldehydes to produce the 7-oxa-1-azaspiro[4.5]decane scaffolds in good yields.

Test products were specially developed luncheon meat, meat replacers and sweets. Each food consisted of a “hard” and “soft” version, expected to lead to different eating rates and consequently to differences in oral sensory exposure time. One hundred and six subjects participated in 7 sessions. During the first sessions, subjects consumed the products ad libitum while watching a movie in a cinema. During the last session, eating rate of all products was measured. Mean intake did not differ significantly between the hard and soft version for any of the products, but subjects who ate more of the soft luncheon meat significantly outnumbered subjects who ate more of the hard version. Eating rate was significantly slower for the hard than for the soft luncheon meat (21±10 vs. 25±13g/min); no differences were found for the other food types. Ad libitum intake was twice as high in the highest versus the lowest quartile of eating rate (p <0.001). Texture differences between the hard and soft versions may have been too subtle to lead to differences in eating rate for meat replacers and sweets and consequently to differences in food intake. 3afood intake 3afoods 3atexture 3asolids 3ahardness 3asensory properties 3aviscosity 3asatiety 3afood choices 3amastication 3aadults 0aeating habits 0asolid foods1 aMars, Monica1 aStafleu, Annette1 ade Graaf, Cees0 tAppetite.g2010 Dec., v. 55, no. 3 p.490-497dAcademic Pressx0195-66637nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.appet.2010.08.0143Available from publisher's Web site  a20110416b20110507c00000000  aINDd3CTe2011/03/09  aNon-US 7aarticle02093naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003700092040001800129100002200147245003500169300001600204500002400220520093700244650002301181650002301204650001101227650000801238650001001246650002001256650002301276650002401299650002001323650002101343650001701364650002101381653003401402773008201436852000901518856008701527930003301614945002501647946001101672655001201683IND4445923220221118063805.0101203e201012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444592322DNAL7 a10.1016/j.appet.2010.07.0162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDunbar, Georgius.10aTask-based nutrition labelling  ap. 431-435.  aIncludes references  aTask-based interface design principles (TBI) were evaluated as a framework for designing effective nutritional labels. In two experiments a total of 123 people assembled a packed lunch, selecting components using labels in GDA or TBI format, or when given only the names of the foods. Study 1 found that a GDA label helped people make healthier choices than the product name alone, but that for a number of types of food, most people would make the same decision with or without a GDA label. Moreover, decisions were much faster when made with the name alone. Study 2 introduced a TBI label in the context of the more specific task of keeping the salt in the lunch under 1g. TBI and GDA labels reduced salt equally, but only the TBI label was as quick as the name alone. Labels that are aligned with people's specific objectives are more efficient. TBI is a potentially useful framework, that can be deployed using mobile computing. 3anutrition labeling 3aDietary Guidelines 3adesign 3amen 3awomen 3adecision making 3aconsumer education 3anutrition education 3anutritive value 3anutrient content 3aserving size 3afood composition 0atask-based nutrition labeling0 tAppetite.g2010 Dec., v. 55, no. 3 p.431-435dAcademic Pressx0195-66637nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.appet.2010.07.0163Available from publisher's Web site  a20110416b20110507c00000000  aINDd3CTe2011/03/09  aNon-US 7aarticle01331naa a2200313 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100002200115245006900137300001400206300002800220520045500248650002000703650001200723650001200735650001900747653001900766653002400785653003000809653003200839773007100871852000900942939003300951945000800984946001300992655001201005991630060390742620221118063721.0800521e197904  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI800006762DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMaurer, Arthur J.10aExtrusion and texturizing in the manufacture of poultry products  ap. 48-51.  ap. 48-51. ill., charts.  aMechanically deboned poultry meat (MDPM), which resembles a very fine meat puree, can be given shape and texture by mixing various textured soy protein ingredients or by the process of extrusion.

Materials and methods: Ten months of initial field work in Ethiopia, three follow up field work, archival work in Ethiopia and Europe, as well as study of available relevant literature. Results: The debut of khat in the West in the 1980s was initially greeted with disdain and indifference. Authorities dismissed it on grounds that the mode of consumption, chewing the leaves for an extended period of time to extract a miniscule amount of the active ingredient, would not be appealing to Western users. Following the Mogadishu debacle of 1993, as depicted in the movie Black Hawk Down, authorities in the West began to express concern that khat was a new drug of abuse. Its trade was increasingly linked with terrorism because of its association with immigrants from the traditional khat use countries in the Horn of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula. Amid hysteria and moral panic, many Western countries classified khat as a highly potent controlled substance, rendering its possession, cultivation, and trade illegal. Conclusion: This article argues that more and more Western governments, out of panic rather than definitive evidence of harm, will be instituting national laws banning the leaves, but khat will not be placed under international control because the scientific evidence of harm is unlikely to rise to a critical mass that would justify its illegalization. States in the source countries would continue to tolerate khat because banning it would be disastrous from an economic and social welfare standpoint. Because of its ambiguous legal position and the unstable nature of its active ingredient, cathinone, khat would not be successfully commoditized as a global commodity or transformed into a highly concentrated illicit drug. In this situation, khat would continue to be chewed in the traditional-use areas of the Red Sea littoral marketed by local syndicates who work with a large network of petty commodity traders. 3alaws and regulations 3ageographical distribution 3ahistory 3asocial welfare 3aconsumption (economics) 3aeconomic impact 3ainternational trade 3anonfood plant products 3aleaves 3acultural heritage 3adomestic trade 3aterrorism 3astimulant plants 3aimmigration 3aCatha edulis 3aEurope 3aEthiopia 0aillicit drugs 0akhat use 0acontrolled substances 0aimmigrants 0acathinone0 tJournal of ethnopharmacology.g2010 Dec. 1, v. 132, no. 3 p.607-614dElsevierx0378-87417nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jep.2010.01.0633Available from publisher's Web site  a20110613b20110701c00000000  aINDd2CTe2011/03/24  aNon-US 7aarticle03770naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001700145245008300162300001600245500017700261500002400438500001500462520214000477650000802617650002802625650002002653650001502673650001302688650002702701650001602728650001902744650001802763650002102781650001602802650001702818651001902835651001002854653003302864653001302897653002902910653001502939700001802954700001802972773009902990852000903089856008503098930003303183945002503216946001103241655001203252IND4445939020221118064046.0101203e20101201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444593902DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jep.2010.09.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKassim, Saba10aValidity and reliability of a Severity of Dependence Scale for khat (SDS-khat)  ap. 570-577.  aIn the special issue: The use and misuse of khat (Catha edulis) in a changing world: Tradition, trade and tragedy / edited by Michael Odenwald, Nasir Warfa, and Axel Klein.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aAims of the study: (1) To assess psychological khat dependence and (2) to assess the validity and reliability of the Severity Dependence Scale () amended for khat use (SDS-khat), in a sample of UK-resident male adult Yemeni khat chewers. Materials and methods: A cross-sectional study using a face to face structured interview schedule was conducted amongst purposively sampled UK-resident adult Yemeni male khat chewers, aged 18 years and above, selected during random visits to places of khat sale. A factor analysis with principal components extraction was conducted to explore the construct validity of the proposed SDS-khat. Reliability of the proposed scale was assessed using test-retest and internal reliability tests. The concurrent validity of the proposed SDS-khat was assessed in relation to individual measures and a composite index of khat chewing behaviours using univariate analyses. Results: Two hundred and four Yemeni male adult khat chewers were interviewed. The mean score of the proposed SDS-khat was 5.52 (SD ±4.03). Forty nine percent of respondents (95% CI=43-55%) with ≤5 scores were more likely not psychologically dependent. A single factor, uni-dimensional solution identifying the five items making up the scale accounted for 52.33% of variance. The internal reliability was good (Cronbach's alpha coefficient=0.76) and the test retest intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) was 0.93 (95% CI=0.80-0.97). Many individual aspects of the khat chewing were significantly related to the scale. Assessment of the proposed SDS-khat's concurrent validity with individual items of khat chewing identified several significant relationships (p ≤0.05) whilst the composite index of khat behaviour also identified a significant relationship (OR=14.40, 95% CI=6.71-30.89). The proposed SDS-khat also correlated with self-reported reasons for khat chewing (p ≤0.001, OR=3.54; 95% CI=1.80-6.96). Conclusions: In this sample of Yemeni khat chewers the SDS-khat is recommended as a valid and reliable research tool for measuring psychological dependence upon khat. Further validation in other samples is indicated. 3amen 3across-sectional studies 3asubstance abuse 3ainterviews 3avalidity 3anonfood plant products 3areliability 3ahuman behavior 3amental health 3astimulant plants 3aimmigration 3aCatha edulis 3aUnited Kingdom 3aYemen 0aSeverity of Dependence scale 0akhat use 0apsychological dependency 0aimmigrants1 aIslam, Sharif1 aCroucher, Ray0 tJournal of ethnopharmacology.g2010 Dec. 1, v. 132, no. 3 p.570-577dElsevierx0378-87417nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jep.2010.09.0093Available from publisher's Web site  a20110613b20110701c00000000  aINDd2CTe2011/03/24  aNon-US 7aarticle02653naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003700092040001800129100002700147245014400174300001600318500002400334520132600358650003301684650002501717650002101742650002601763650002601789650001801815650002201833650002301855651001801878653002801896653002701924700002101951700002401972773008201996852000902078856008702087930003302174945002502207946001102232655001202243IND4445927920221118064026.0101203e201012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444592792DNAL7 a10.1016/j.appet.2010.10.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGarden-Robinson, Julie10aUse of electronic group method in assessing food safety training needs and delivery methods among international college students in the U.S  ap. 746-749.  aIncludes references  aThe purpose of this study was to determine the types of unfamiliar foods international students in the U.S. encounter and to assess food safety information that international students would like to receive for mitigating risks associated with handling and preparing unfamiliar foods. The study identified preferred instructional delivery methods and media for receiving food safety training or information. An electronic group method was used for this study. The electronic group method was chosen to maximize group efficiency by allowing participants to share ideas simultaneously and anonymously with minimal use of time and resources.Types of different (unfamiliar) foods were grouped into major categories. Fast and ready-to-eat foods, and processed and frozen foods constituted a major change for some international students, who were accustomed to homemade and fresh foods in their countries. Participants were interested in receiving information about how to safely handle and prepare unfamiliar foods in their new environment. Preferred methods for receiving food safety information included written materials, online publications, presentations, and materials provided during student orientation. Food packages, websites, and television programs were other preferred methods of receiving food safety information. 3aelectronic discussion groups 3ainformation exchange 3acollege students 3afood safety education 3anutrition information 3afood handling 3afoodborne illness 3adisease prevention 3aUnited States 0aelectronic group method 0ainternational students1 aEighmy, Myron A.1 aLyonga, Agnes Ngale0 tAppetite.g2010 Dec., v. 55, no. 3 p.746-749dAcademic Pressx0195-66637nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.appet.2010.10.0073Available from publisher's Web site  a20110416b20110507c00000000  aINDd3CTe2011/03/09  aNon-US 7aarticle01843naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001500152245010900167300001600276500002400292520052400316650000900840650002400849650002800873650003000901650002200931650002200953650002200975650001700997650002301014650001701037650001701054650002701071653002301098700001301121773011701134852000901251856009201260930003301352945002501385946001101410655001201421IND4446139420221118063942.0101208e201012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444613942DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1748-5827.2010.01000.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMorgan, E.10aAngiostrongylus vasorum infection in dogs: continuing spread and developments in diagnosis and treatment  ap. 616-621.  aIncludes references  aDisease caused by Angiostrongylus vasorum is increasingly diagnosed in dogs, as the geographic range of the parasite increases along with awareness among clinicians.

This study was aimed to evaluate the status of oxidative stress indices in blood of camels naturally infested with S. scabiei. Forty-seven male camels (Camelus dromedaries) were divided according to the extent of the infested area with Sarcoptes scabiei into four groups, mild (MID, n = 12), moderate (MOD, n = 10), severely infested (SEV, n = 10) and healthy control group (n = 15). Blood was used for determination of red cell count (RBC), hemoglobin (Hb), packed cell volume (PCV), serum nitric oxide (NO•, a free radical), ascorbate and albumin concentrations, and erythrocytic values of malondialdehyde (MDA, a marker of lipid peroxidation), protein carbonyls (PC, an indicator of protein oxidation), glutathione (GSH) superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT). Decreased levels (P < 0.05) of RBC, Hb, PCV, albumin and ascorbate were noticed in MOD and SEV compared to controls with the lowest values (P < 0.05) in SEV except for ascorbate, where MOD did not differ from SEV. Compared to controls, NO• gradually increased (P < 0.05) in MID followed by MOD and SEV, whereas MDA and PC were higher (P < 0.05) in MOD and SEV. PC was higher (P < 0.05) in MOD than SEV. In addition, the antioxidants GSH, SOD and CAT were higher (P < 0.05) in MID and lower (P < 0.05) in MOD and SEV compared to controls. GSH was lower (P < 0.05) in SEV compared to MOD. Besides, Hb was negatively correlated with NO• (r = −0.68, P < 0.001), MDA (r = −0.53, P < 0.001) and PC (r = −0.73, P < 0.001). In conclusion, dromedary sarcoptosis is accompanied by a state of oxidative stress process, which increased by increasing the area of infestation, and may contribute to the pathogenesis of the disease. 3ablood chemistry 3adisease course 3ahematologic tests 3abiomarkers 3areactive oxygen species 3avalidity 3aSarcoptes scabiei 3aCamelus dromedarius 3ascabies 3apathogenesis 3abiochemical mechanisms 3aoxidative stress 0adromedaries1 aMahran, Osman M. 1 aBassam Al-Salahy, M. 0 tVeterinary research communications.g2011 Jan., v. 35, no. 1 p.35-45dSpringer Netherlandsx0165-73807nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11259-010-9450-x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20110417b20110507c00000000  aINDd4CTe2011/03/27  aNon-US 7aarticle01230naa a2200277 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097245003300115300001400148300002200162520053200184650001300716650001800729650001600747650001900763650001500782650000900797773007100806852000900877939003300886945000800919946001300927655001200940991630050650742620221118063856.0860915e198606  xx ||||go|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI860111352DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL10aSulfites as food ingredients  ap. 47-52.  ap. 47-52. charts.  aA scientific summary is presented on the use of sulfiting agents in foods, the rationale for their use, their chemical and metabolic fate, and their safety to humans.

However, the regulatory mechanism of NMS on LH in pigs remains unexplored. In the present study, we confirmed the hypothesis that the effect of NMS on LH could be mediated via hypothalamic melanocyte-stimulating hormones (MSH) neurons of ovariectomized pigs. In an immunohistological experiment, NMS receptor NMU2R-positive neurons were found in the paraventricular nucleus of hypothalamus, widely distributed in the anterior pituitary, and sparsely observed in the posterior pituitary. We also found that serum LH level was declined at between 12 and 60min with the lowest level at 24min after NMS injection. The decreased LH secretion induced by NMS could be completely abolished by pretreatment with melanocortin receptor-4 antagonist SHU9119, while a signal injection of 1.0nM SHU9119 per se did not affect the serum LH level. Real time quantitative RT-PCR results showed that the expression of GnRH and LH mRNAs were down-regulated by NMS treatment, but their reduction was restored to normal level by SHU9119 treatments. The expression of NMU2R and PR mRNAs were up-regulated by NMS treatment, but their effects were blocked by SHU9119 treatments. The expression of the estrogen receptor mRNA in the pig hypothalamus and pituitary was unchanged under the NMS and SHU9119+NMS treatments. In summary, all results suggest that the inhibitory effect of NMS on LH is at least in part through its receptor NMU2R and mediated via MSH neurons in hypothalamus-pituitary axis of ovariectomized pigs. 3aanterior pituitary 3amessenger RNA 3ahypothalamus 3ahormone secretion 3aneurons 3ablood serum 3aposterior pituitary 3anormal values 3aovariectomy 3ainjection 3asows 3aluteinizing hormone 3amelanocyte-stimulating hormone 0apituitary gland 0aneuromedin S 0amelanocortin receptor-4 antagonist SHU9119 0aestrogen receptor1 aSu, Juan1 aYao, Yuan1 aLei, Zhihai1 aZhang, Guorui1 aLi, Xun0 tAnimal reproduction science.g2010 Dec., v. 122, no. 3-4 p.367-374dElsevier Sciencex0378-43207nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.anireprosci.2010.10.0113Available from publisher's Web site  a20110625b20110701c00000000  aINDd6CTe2011/02/20  aNon-US 7aarticle02636naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004300092040001800135072000900153072000900162100001400171245008100185300001600266500002400282520130700306650001901613650003301632650003401665650001801699650001001717650001701727651001001744653003201754700001901786700001701805700001201822700001501834700001901849700001601868700001701884773010601901852000902007856009302016930003302109945002502142946001102167655001202178IND4446302220221118064010.0101210e201012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444630222DNAL7 a10.1016/j.anireprosci.2010.10.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL210 0aL2001 aHu, Junhe10aFSH is superior to eCG for promoting ovarian response in Chinese Bamei gilts  ap. 313-316.  aIncludes references  aThe Bamei gilt is a Chinese native breed located in northwest China, which adapts to the extremely dry and cold environment and is distinguished for its excellent reproductive and maternal characters. To ensure sufficient numbers of embryos for transgenic and nuclear transfer research, hormonal induction of gilt estrus and superovulation may be necessary. The objective of this study was to compare the superovulation effects of equine chorionic gonadotropin (eCG, Group A) and FSH (Groups B-D) in Chinese Bamei gilts. The results show that though eCG could produce more corpora lutea (CL, 14.3) than the control (CL, 9.2), and the FSH treatments had significantly increased the number of CL compared with the eCG treatment. Within the different FSH protocols, the numbers of CL were significantly greater in Groups B (CL, 77.8) and C (CL, 66.8) than in Group D (CL, 42.7), however, ovarian cysts were observed in Groups B and C, but not in Group D. These data suggest that Group D (280IU FSH) is a suitable protocol to facilitate the development of ovarian follicles and increase the number of useful embryos per gilt for embryos recovery. The optimal FSH protocol of superovulation in Bamei gilts appears to be: D13/100IU, D14/80IU, D15/60IU, D16/40IU plus prostaglandin (PG) 0.2mg, D17/hCG 1000IU. 3asuperovulation 3afollicle-stimulating hormone 3aequine chorionic gonadotropin 3acorpus luteum 3agilts 3aswine breeds 3aChina 0aChinese Bamei (swine breed)1 aBao, Jianchang1 aMa, Xiaoling1 aLi, Wei1 aLei, Anmin1 aYang, Chunrong1 aGao, Zhimin1 aWang, Huayan0 tAnimal reproduction science.g2010 Dec., v. 122, no. 3-4 p.313-316dElsevier Sciencex0378-43207nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.anireprosci.2010.10.0043Available from publisher's Web site  a20110407b20110507c00000000  aINDd6CTe2011/02/20  aNon-US 7aarticle03590naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004300092040001800135072000900153100001800162245019100180300001600371500002400387500001500411520213600426650001202562650001202574650001902586650001602605650001002621650001202631650001402643650001802657650002102675650002002696653002302716653001202739653003802751700001902789700001602808700001902824773010602843852000902949856009302958930003303051945002503084946001103109655001203120IND4446301920221118063943.0101210e201012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444630192DNAL7 a10.1016/j.anireprosci.2010.09.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL2101 aZabuli, Jahid10aIntermittent nutritional stimulus by short-term treatment of high-energy diet promotes ovarian performance together with increases in blood levels of glucose and insulin in cycling goats  ap. 288-293.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThe aim of this study was to determine if short-term intermittent treatments of high-energy diet have any stimulatory effects on ovarian function and metabolic status in goat. Cycling Shiba goats were divided into treatment (TG; n =6) and control (CG; n =6) groups. After the detection of ovulation (1st ovulation, Day 0) by ultrasonography, a high-energy diet (250% of maintenance) was fed to the TG from Day 12 to Day 15 (4 days) and from Day 18 to Day 21 (4 days). The high-energy diet comprised 1000g hay-cubes and 300g of concentrated feed/head/day (approximately 15MJ of digestible energy/day). The CG was offered maintenance diet throughout the experiment. Transrectal ultrasound examinations were conducted every other day during the luteal phase and were conducted daily during the follicular phase. Blood samples were collected daily from Day −2 to 7 days after ovulation (2nd ovulation) following the nutritional treatment for analysis of follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), progesterone, oestradiol, glucose and insulin in plasma. Two wave-like rises in the concentrations of glucose and insulin appeared in response to the intermittent nutritional stimulus. Mean plasma concentrations of glucose and insulin were significantly (P <0.05) higher in the TG than in the CG on almost all days during each treatment period. For ovarian performance, the total number of follicles that developed on the day prior to the 2nd ovulation in the TG (7.5±2.7) was significantly higher than that of the CG (4.5±2.6). Ovulation rate of the 2nd ovulation (4.5±1.0) in the TG was significantly higher than that of the 1st ovulation (3.0±0.6) of the TG and than both 1st (2.5±0.5) and 2nd (2.7±0.5) ovulations of the CG. No significant difference was detected in the concentrations of FSH, progesterone and oestradiol throughout the experiment between TG and CG. The present experiment demonstrated that short-term intermittent nutritional stimulus from the luteal phase increased the total number of ovulatory follicles and the ovulation rate in association with increasing plasma concentrations of glucose and insulin in goats. 3afemales 3aglucose 3ablood sampling 3agoat breeds 3agoats 3ainsulin 3aovulation 3aestrous cycle 3ahigh energy diet 3aultrasonography 0aShiba (goat breed) 0aovaries 0aintermittent nutritional stimulus1 aTanaka, Tomomi1 aLu, Wengeng1 aKamomae, Hideo0 tAnimal reproduction science.g2010 Dec., v. 122, no. 3-4 p.288-293dElsevier Sciencex0378-43207nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.anireprosci.2010.09.0053Available from publisher's Web site  a20110407b20110507c00000000  aINDd6CTe2011/02/20  aNon-US 7aarticle01711naa a2200325 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100001500115245007800130300001600208300002400224520078500248650002001033650002001053650001601073650001901089650002301108651001001131653002401141653002701165700002001192773010001212852000901312939003301321945000801354946001101362655001201373991630043950742620221118064058.0821207e198110  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI820013332DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGujral, S.10aDietary habits and infant feeding practices of Nepalese lactating mothers  ap. 365-371.  ap. 365-371. charts.  aA dietary survey on 100 lactating Nepalese mothers with infants under 12 months showed diet variations according to the length of the breastfeeding period.

However, the diet was adequate in all nutrients except calcium, carotene, and vitamin A. Low income mothers consumed fewer nutrients than high income mothers. Mothers felt that breastfeeding should be continued until 12 to 24 months. Seventy-three percent of the mothers felt that supplementation should begin during the period from 6 weeks to 6 months.

The leaf-derived callus induced on 2.26 μM 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2, 4-D) + 2.32 μM Kinetin (Kin) upon transfer to medium containing thidiazuron (TDZ) exhibited higher shoot regeneration (32.4 ± 1.3 shoots per culture). Four-week-old shoots rooted readily on 1.5 μM Indol acetic acid (IAA)-containing medium and were successfully acclimatized with 98% survival. The lignans, Phyllanthin (PH) and Hypohyllanthin (HPH), of leaf extracts from naturally grown plants were identified by using TLC, HPLC and H1-NMR. The PH and HPH production in the regenerated shoots was compared to their production in callus cultures, plants under field conditions and in naturally grown plants. The regenerated shoots on MS + 2.27 μM TDZ produced about two times higher PH and HPH than the leaves of naturally grown plant. The present study provides a useful system for further studies on in vitro morphogenesis, elicitor-assisted production of PH and HPH and A. rhizogenes-mediated genetic transformation in Phyllanthus amarus. 3akinetin 3ain vitro regeneration 3aquantitative analysis 3amorphogenesis 3aexplants 3amedicinal plants 3astem nodes 3aacclimation 3aplant extracts 3arooting 3alignans 3acallus culture 3aleaves 3aindole acetic acid 3a2,4-D 3aculture media 3aPhyllanthus amarus 3ahepatoprotective effect 0athidiazuron 0amedicinal properties 0aphytochemicals1 aNaik, D.

However, the price of lime varies widely between high and low yield-months due to the large difference of supply in the market. Under the tropics, the flowering of lime is promoted by a dry period while it is limited by a rainy period; therefore the flowering and yields of limes are mainly dependent upon the yearly distribution of rainfall. Around fifteen years ago, research on growing limes in cement containers in the aim of controlling flowering by covering the container with plastic during rainfall was undertaken. Since then, growing lime in containers was progressively developed as a commercial practice. At present different kinds of containers are used commercially such as used tires, clay pots, bamboo baskets, plastic buckets and plastic bags of different sizes. When lime trees are grown in a container the size of tree canopy is reduced, therefore a high density planting was adopted. Efficient irrigation and fertilizing systems have been also developed along with pruning practices according to the plant spacing. Nowadays, growing lime in containers is widely spread to every region of Thailand as it provides a model for the control of flowering time and canopy size under tropical conditions. The varietal cultivation techniques will be shown and discussed. 3aCitrus aurantiifolia 3abamboos 3abuckets 3acanopy 3acement 3aclay 3aflowering date 3ahigh density planting 3airrigation 3alimes 3amarkets 3amodels 3aplastic bags 3aplastics 3aprices 3apruning 3arain 3asoft drinks 3atires 3atrees 3atropics 3awet season 3aThailand0 tActa horticulturae.g2018 June 30, , no. 1205 p.289-292dInternational Society for Horticultural Science.wJournal:jnl46289x0567-75727nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.17660/ActaHortic.2018.1205.33  aDNAL 7aarticle02223naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110100001700127245011700144300001400261500007400275500001500349520113700364650002601501650003301527650002301560650001201583650002001595650001701615650002501632650001001657653001801667700002201685773006401707852000901771930003301780945002501813946001101838655001201849IND4374502620221118064318.0050919e200508  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437450262DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

In this article we draw on insights from discursive psychology to demonstrate how members of an online forum on food pleasure handle the hedonic appreciation of food in everyday interaction. We examined 40 discussions consisting of 1715 e-mails related to culinary topics. The analysis focuses on the way in which the participants of this forum work up and establish their identities as 'gourmets'. A dominant tool in performing this identity work is the discursive construction of independent access to knowledge of and experience with food items, so as to compete with or resist the epistemic superiority of a preceding evaluation. Data are presented with nine examples of the 73 manifestations of the construction of independent access. Contrary to sensory approaches to food choice, this study depicts the enjoyment of food as an interactional achievement rather than a pure physiological sensation. Wider implications of this study for the relation between food, identity and taste are discussed. 3acommunication (human) 3aelectronic discussion groups 3asensory properties 3acuisine 3asocial behavior 3afood choices 3aqualitative analysis 3ataste 0aeating habits1 aMolder, H.F.M. te0 tAppetite.g2005 Aug., v. 45, no. 1 p.51-61x0195-66637nnas  aDNAL  a20080708b20080801c00000000  aINDd3CTe2005/11/15  aNon-US 7aarticle02325naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111072001700129100002000146245006000166300001600226520096500242650002501207650002401232650001401256650002001270650002001290650001001310650001901320650001201339650001001351650002601361650003101387650002301418650001801441650001101459650001101470650002301481650001701504650002901521650001801550650001801568653004001586700001801626700001901644773006601663852000901729930003301738945002501771946001101796655001201807IND4377716220221118064211.0060207e200512  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437771622DNAL7 a161719012pmid  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aBrunstrom, J.M.10aDietary restraint and cognitive performance in children  ap. 235-241.  aAdults who attempt to restrict their dietary intake also tend to perform worse on a range of cognitive tasks. However, the extent to which this finding generalises to children has remained unclear. Following studies involving adults, we asked 44 girls (mean age=10.1 years) to complete a simple reaction-time task and the Tower of London task. This group was selected from a local community school in the East Midlands (UK). Dietary restraint was measured using a version of the Dutch Eating Behaviour Questionnaire that had been adapted for use by children. Our results indicate that children with high restraint scores have longer reaction times and they also tend to perform worse on the TOL task. Other aspects of our data also suggest the dietary restraint may be correlated negatively with a measure of academic ability. We discuss reasons why restraint and performance might be related causally and we conclude that this issue warrants further scrutiny. 3aacademic achievement 3adietary restriction 3acognition 3achild nutrition 3aschool children 3agirls 3aquestionnaires 3adieting 2aChild 2aCognitionxphysiology 2aDiet, Reducingxpsychology 2aEatingxpsychology 2aEnergy Intake 2aFemale 2aHumans 2aMemory, Short-Term 2aMotor Skills 2aNeuropsychological Tests 2aPsychometrics 2aReaction Time 0aDutch Eating Behavior Questionnaire1 aDavison, C.J.1 aMitchell, G.L.0 tAppetite.g2005 Dec., v. 45, no. 3 p.235-241x0195-66637nnas  aDNAL  a20060413b20060529c00000000  aINDd3CTe2006/02/21  aNon-US 7aarticle02413naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111072001700129100001900146245016300165300001600328500001500344520101400359650001701373650001801390650001801408650001601426650002701442650001801469650001801487650000901505650002301514650001201537650002601549650001701575650001801592650003301610650000901643650000901652650002101661650003101682653001601713700001601729700001801745773006601763852000901829930003301838945002501871946001101896655001201907IND4375636820221118064346.0051031e200510  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437563682DNAL7 a159224892pmid  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aSynowski, S.J.10aMeal size of high-fat food is reliably greater than high-carbohydrate food across externally-evoked single-meal tests and long-term spontaneous feeding in rat  ap. 191-194.  a2019-12-05  aA series of studies in rat using isoenergetic (kcal/ml) liquid diets differing in fat content has previously found dietary fat to dose-dependently increase daily caloric intake. In single-meal tests in which meal initiation was externally evoked in feeding-associated environments, the behavioral expression of this overeating was found to be larger meal intake. The present studies confirmed the ecological validity of this larger meal size of high-fat diet (HF) relative to high-carbohydrate diet (HC): meal size of HF>HC in home-cage testing (Experiment 1), and during undisturbed, spontaneous feeding in which ingestive behavior was continuously monitored (Experiments 2 and 3). These findings demonstrate that single-meal paradigms yield results consistent with spontaneous feeding of high-fat and high-carbohydrate liquid diets, thus supporting the use of single-meal studies to better understand the physiological bases of elevated caloric intake associated with chronic consumption of a high-fat diet. 3aportion size 3ahigh fat diet 3aeating habits 3adietary fat 3ahigh carbohydrate diet 3aenergy intake 3aanimal models 3arats 3aad libitum feeding 2aAnimals 2aDietary Carbohydrates 2aDietary Fats 2aEnergy Intake 2aFeeding Behaviorxpsychology 2aMale 2aRats 2aRats, Long-Evans 2aReproducibility of Results 0afood intake1 aSmart, A.B.1 aWarwick, Z.S.0 tAppetite.g2005 Oct., v. 45, no. 2 p.191-194x0195-66637nnas  aDNAL  a20080321b20080404c00000000  aINDd2CTe2005/12/16  aNon-US 7aarticle03113naa a2200637 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111072001700129072001700146100001600163245009000179300001600269500001500285520146600300650001901766650000901785650000801794650001001802650002701812650002501839650001601864650002301880650002201903650002501925650001801950650001701968650001501985650001102000650001602011650002802027650001502055650000902070650001702079650002102096650002702117650001002144650001102154650001202165650001902177650001502196653001302211653001802224653002502242700001602267700001902283700001702302773006602319852000902385930003302394945002502427946001102452655001202463IND4375637020221118064316.0051031e200510  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437563702DNAL7 a159273032pmid  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aPearson, T.10aDo 'food deserts' influence fruit and vegetable consumption?--a cross sectional study  ap. 195-197.  a2019-12-05  aLack of access to affordable healthy foods has been suggested to be a contributory factor to poor diet. This study investigated associations between diet and access to supermarkets, transport, fruit and vegetable price and deprivation, in a region divergent in geography and socio-economic indices. A postal survey of 1000 addresses (response rate 42%) gathered information on family demographics, supermarket and shop use, car ownership, mobility and previous day's fruit and vegetable intake. Postcode information was used to derive road travel distance to nearest supermarket and deprivation index. Fruit and vegetable prices were assessed using a shopping basket survey. Generalised linear regression models were used to ascertain predictors of fruit and vegetable intake. Male grocery shoppers ate less fruit than female grocery shoppers. Consumption of vegetables increased slightly with age. Deprivation, supermarket fruit and vegetable price, distance to nearest supermarket and potential difficulties with grocery shopping were not significantly associated with either fruit or vegetable consumption. These data suggest that the three key elements of a food desert, fruit and vegetable price, socio-economic deprivation and a lack of locally available supermarkets, were not factors influencing fruit or vegetable intake. We suggest that food policies aimed at improving diet should be orientated towards changing socio-cultural attitudes towards food. 3agrocery stores 3adiet 3amen 3awomen 3ageographical variation 3anutritional adequacy 3aautomobiles 3agender differences 3afood availability 3asocioeconomic status 3afood security 3afood choices 3avegetables 3aadults 3afood prices 2aCross-Sectional Studies 2aDemography 2aDiet 2aDiet Surveys 2aFeeding Behavior 2aFood Supplyxeconomics 2aFruit 2aHumans 2aPoverty 2aTransportation 2aVegetables 0amobility 0afruits (food) 0aautomobile ownership1 aRussell, J.1 aCampbell, M.J.1 aBarker, M.E.0 tAppetite.g2005 Oct., v. 45, no. 2 p.195-197x0195-66637nnas  aDNAL  a20080321b20080404c00000000  aINDd2CTe2005/12/16  aNon-US 7aarticle02266naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111072001700129100001700146245005800163300001600221500001500237520081700252650001701069650001601086650002201102650002701124650001101151650001301162650001701175650002001192650001501212650001001227650000901237650002201246650001301268650000901281650001701290650002101307650001101328650001101339650000901350650001601359650002601375650001201401651001101413651001101424653001801435653001701453653001501470700001601485700001901501773006601520852000901586930003301595945002501628946001101653655001201664IND4375635820221118064213.0051031e200510  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437563582DNAL7 a160118592pmid  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aHonkanen, P.10aIntention to consume seafood--the importance of habit  ap. 161-168.  a2019-12-05  aThe role of habit strength and past behaviour were studied in order to gain a better understanding of seafood consumption behaviour. A sample of Norwegian adults (N=1579) responded to a self-administered questionnaire about seafood consumption habits, past frequency of seafood consumption, and attitude towards and intention to eat seafood. Structural equation modelling revealed that past behaviour and habit, rather than attitudes, were found to explain differences in intention, indicating that forming intention does not necessarily have to be reasoned. The results also indicated that when a strong habit is present, the expression of an intention might be guided by the salience of past behaviour rather than by attitudes. The findings of this study might thus have consequences for dietary interventions. 3afood beliefs 3afood intake 3asimulation models 3aattitudes and opinions 3ahumans 3aseafoods 3afood choices 3adietary surveys 2aAdolescent 2aAdult 2aAged 2aAged, 80 and over 2aAttitude 2aDiet 2aDiet Surveys 2aFeeding Behavior 2aFemale 2aHumans 2aMale 2aMiddle Aged 2aModels, Psychological 2aSeafood 3aNorway 0aNorway 0aeating habits 0apat behavior 0aintentions1 aOlsen, S.O.1 aVerplanken, B.0 tAppetite.g2005 Oct., v. 45, no. 2 p.161-168x0195-66637nnas  aDNAL  a20080321b20080404c00000000  aINDd2CTe2005/12/16  aNon-US 7aarticle02874naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110100001500127245011100142300001600253500001500269520159000284650001601874650001701890650001801907650001401925650001101939650001001950650001801960650002101978650002101999650001602020650001402036650001802050650001202068650001602080650000902096650001902105650002202124653002002146653001402166700001402180700001502194700001502209773006602224852000902290930003302299945002502332946001102357655001202368IND4375635120221118064208.0051031e200510  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437563512DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aLukats, B.10aHomeostatic alterations induced by interleukin-1β microinjection into the orbitofrontal cortex in the rat  ap. 137-147.  a2019-12-05  aThe present experiments were designed to elucidate the effect of direct orbitofrontal cortical administration of interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) on the homeostatic regulation. Short- and long-term food intakes (FI), water intakes and body temperature (BT) were measured before and after a bilateral microinjection of IL-1beta (with or without paracetamol /P/ pretreatment) into the orbitofrontal cortex (OBF) of Wistar rats, and the effects were compared with those found in vehicle-treated and i.p. injected IL-1beta, IL-1beta+P or control animals. In addition, blood glucose levels (BGLs), along a glucose tolerance test, and plasma concentrations of insulin, leptin, cholesterol, triglycerides and urate were determined in cytokine treated and control rats. Short-term FI was suppressed after orbitofrontal cortical or peripheral application of IL-1beta. In the long-term FI, however, there was no significant difference among the groups. Cytokine microinjection into the OBF, similar to the i.p. administration, was also followed by a significant increase in BT. Pretreatment with P failed to influence the anorexigenic and hyperthermic effects of the centrally administered IL-1beta. The sugar load led to a diabetes-like prolonged elevation of BGL in the IL-1beta treated animals. Following cytokine administration, plasma levels of insulin and that of triglycerides were found decreased, whereas that of uric acid increased. The present findings confirm that the OBF is one of the neural routes through which IL-1beta exerts modulatory effect on the central homeostatic regulation. 3afood intake 3ablood lipids 3ainterleukin-1 3auric acid 3aleptin 3abrain 3ablood glucose 3atriacylglycerols 3abody temperature 3acholesterol 3ainjection 3aanimal models 3ainsulin 3ahomeostasis 3arats 3adrinking water 3aglucose tolerance 0ablood chemistry 0acytokines1 aEgyed, R.1 aLenard, L.1 aKaradi, Z.0 tAppetite.g2005 Oct., v. 45, no. 2 p.137-147x0195-66637nnas  aDNAL  a20080321b20080404c00000000  aINDd2CTe2005/12/16  aNon-US 7aarticle02482naa a2200613 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111072001700129072001700146100001800163245002300181300001400204500010500218500001500323520074900338650001301087650001601100650001001116650001601126650001801142650002601160650002401186650002801210650001301238650001701251650001701268650002201285650001401307650003601321650003001357650003301387650003301420650001301453650001101466650003901477650003101516650002201547650002801569653001801597653001701615653002301632653001701655653002601672700001601698773006401714852000901778930003301787945002501820946001101845655001201856IND4378068920221118064324.0060223e200601  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437806892DNAL7 a162574742pmid  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

The reinforcing value of food is mediated in part by dopaminergic activity. Genotypes that influence dopamine transport and the density of dopamine D2 receptors interact with food reinforcement to influence eating behavior, and D2 receptor genotypes may influence food reinforcement and weight gain after smoking cessation. Inhibition of dopamine transport increases brain dopamine concentrations, which may influence weight gain after smoking cessation and can reduce energy intake in obese adults. 3adopamine 3afood intake 3afoods 3aweight gain 3aenergy intake 3abehavior modification 3adietary restriction 3aphysiological transport 3agenotype 3apalatability 3afood choices 3agenetic variation 3areceptors 2aDopaminexgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aEnergy Intakexphysiology 2aFood Deprivationxphysiology 2aFood Preferencesxphysiology 2aGenotype 2aHumans 2aReceptors, Dopamine D2xmetabolism 2aReinforcement, Psychology. 2aSmoking Cessation 2aWeight Gainxphysiology 0aeating habits 0afood variety 0aliterature reviews 0afood rewards 0adopaminergic activity1 aLeddy, J.J.0 tAppetite.g2006 Jan., v. 46, no. 1 p.22-25x0195-66637nnas  aDNAL  a20060914b20061003c00000000  aINDd2CTe2006/09/07  aNon-US 7aarticle02420naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111072001700129100001500146245008800161300001400249500010500263520103300368650001101401650002401412650001601436650001701452650002501469650002201494650001701516650001601533650001901549650003601568650003001604650002101634650001101655650003001666650005601696650001601752653002301768700001701791773006401808852000901872930003301881945002501914946001101939655001201950IND4378068820221118064212.0060223e200601  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437806882DNAL7 a161718982pmid  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aLowe, M.R.10aStress-induced eating in restrained eaters may not be caused by stress or restraint  ap. 16-21.  aPaper presented at the meeting "Eating Disorders & Obesity", July 18-20, 2004, College Corner, Ohio.  aRestrained eaters tend to increase and unrestrained eaters to decrease their food intake when stressed. This relationship, though robust, does not appear to be caused by restrained eating or by stress per se. For restraint, evidence indicates that none of the common operationalizations of restraint can account for restraint-related effects that have been examined to date. It is therefore unlikely that restraint is responsible for stress-induced eating in restrained eaters. Rather, behavioral and physiological data suggest that restrained eating may be a proxy risk factor for vulnerability to weight gain. For stress, a variety of minimally stressful perturbations (e.g. nonthreatening cognitive loads) have been shown to elicit increased intake in restrained eaters. Thus, the negative affect created by manipulations used to create stress (e.g. scary movies, failure at a task) does not appear to be necessary to provoke overeating. An adequate explanation for stress-induced eating in restrained eaters remains elusive. 3ahumans 3adietary restriction 3afood intake 3afood choices 3apsychological stress 3astress management 3arisk factors 3aweight gain 3aweight control 2aEatingxphysiologyxpsychology. 2aEnergy Intakexphysiology 2aFeeding Behavior 2aHumans 2aInternal-External Control 2aStress, Psychologicalxphysiopathologyxpsychology. 2aWeight Gain 0aliterature reviews1 aKral, T.V.E.0 tAppetite.g2006 Jan., v. 46, no. 1 p.16-21x0195-66637nnas  aDNAL  a20060913b20061003c00000000  aINDd2CTe2006/09/07  aNon-US 7aarticle02607naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111072001700129100002200146245012000168300001600288500001500304520112300319650001301442650001001455650002201465650001101487650001801498650002101516650001201537650005201549650001501601650004901616650002901665650004201694650000901736650003901745650002201784650003701806650003701843653002001880700002301900700001801923700001601941773006601957852000902023930003302032945002502065946001102090655001202101IND4377717820221118064214.0060207e200512  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437771782DNAL7 a161127772pmid  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Three groups of 10 hamsters were pre-exposed to 5 mM dulcin, 50 mM potassium L-glutamate (KGlu) or 1 mM 5'guanosine monophosphate (5'GMP). In the fourth group, the tongue was rinsed with 5'GMP for 20 min just prior to recording from the chorda tympani. The tastants were novel to the fifth group (naive control). A series of 17 stimuli was repeated six times and responses were quantified relative to the initial response of each of the 50 hamsters. The responses of the chorda tympani increased with repetition in the control group. In contrast, no increase in amplitude of response to the pre-exposed tastants or to stimuli with qualitatively related tastes was observed in the group familiarized with either KGlu or 5'GMP. These results indicate that the response of the chorda tympani depends on previous exposure to a tastant. The sensitivity of taste cells appears to be modulated, possibly by stimulus-induced supplementary receptors. 3ahamsters 3abrain 3ataste sensitivity 3aflavor 3aanimal models 3aflavor compounds 2aAnimals 2aChorda Tympani Nervexdrug effectsxphysiology. 2aCricetinae 2aEvoked Potentials, Somatosensoryxphysiology 2aGlutamatesxpharmacology 2aGuanosine Monophosphatexpharmacology 2aMale 2aPhenylurea Compoundsxpharmacology 2aRandom Allocation 2aTastexdrug effectsxphysiology. 2aTonguexinnervationxphysiology. 0aneurophysiology1 aBoireau-Ducept, N.1 aPillias, A.M.1 aFaurion, A.0 tAppetite.g2005 Dec., v. 45, no. 3 p.324-333x0195-66637nnas  aDNAL  a20060413b20060529c00000000  aINDd3CTe2006/02/21  aNon-US 7aarticle02336naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111072001700129100001800146245006700164300001600231520093600247650001201183650001701195650002801212650002001240650001701260650000801277650001001285650002301295650001901318650002401337650001101361650001501372650001001387650002501397650002401422650001101446650002501457650003301482650001101515650002801526650000901554650001801563650003301581650002201614700001401636773006601650852000901716930003301725945002501758946001101783655001201794IND4377717620221118064305.0060207e200512  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437771762DNAL7 a161127762pmid  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aTiggemann, M.14aThe phenomenology of food cravings: the role of mental imagery  ap. 305-313.  aThe study aimed to investigate the role of mental imagery in the experience of food cravings. A sample of 130 undergraduate students was first asked to recall and rate a previous food craving experience. Second, they were asked to imagine themselves eating their favourite food and to rate the involvement of different sensory modalities. It was found that mental imagery was a key element in both the retrospective craving experience and the current food induction. In particular, craving intensity was related to the vividness of the food image (r=.46). The specific sensory modalities most involved were visual (39.7%) and gustatory (30.6%), followed by olfactory (15.8%). There was little involvement of auditory or tactile modalities. It was concluded that cognitive experimental techniques aimed at reducing the vividness of visual, gustatory or olfactory imagery, might usefully be deployed to reduce unwanted food cravings. 3acraving 3afood choices 3aperceptions (cognitive) 3aneurophysiology 3ayoung adults 3amen 3awomen 3asensory properties 3aquestionnaires 3adietary restriction 3ahunger 2aAdolescent 2aAdult 2aAppetitexphysiology 2aArousalxphysiology 2aFemale 2aFoodxclassification 2aFood Preferencesxpsychology 2aHumans 2aImaginationxphysiology 2aMale 2aMental Recall 2aSatiety Responsexphysiology 2aTastexphysiology1 aKemps, E.0 tAppetite.g2005 Dec., v. 45, no. 3 p.305-313x0195-66637nnas  aDNAL  a20060413b20060529c00000000  aINDd3CTe2006/02/21  aNon-US 7aarticle02538naa a2200385 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100001900115245011000134300001400244300002200258500001500280520150800295650001601803650000901819650001101828650000901839650001501848650001301863651001001876653001301886653002101899653001301920653001501933700002101948773009701969852001302066939003302079945000802112946001102120852000902131655001202140991630037730742620221118064518.0860113e198402  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI860087192DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMalhotra, A.K.12aA Study of anaemia and nutritive adequacies of the rural school children of district Wardha (Maharashtra)  ap. 46-53.  ap. 46-53. charts.  a2019-12-05  aAn investigation was carried out among school children in rural Sevagram of district Wardha to determine the prevalence of anemia and its relationship to nutrient intake. Anemia was defined as a hemoglobin level less than 12 grams per 100 ml. Diet surveys based on 24-hour recalls were used to estimate the nutrient content of the diet (particularly calories, protein, and iron) and were compared to recommended daily allowances for Indians. Hemoglobin values were determined for 496 children, aged 6-14 years; diet surveys were conducted on every 5th child in the sample. Two-thirds of the children had hemoglobin levels below 12 grams per 100 ml. Diets were based mainly on millets and pulses and were below recommended intakes for green leafy vegetables, milk, fruits, and fats and oils. Protein intakes were adequate in children 6-9 years of age, but were low in the diets of 10-15 year olds. Iron intakes were adequate for all groups except 13-15 year old females, but the predominant iron source was millet, for which the iron absorption is 1.4 percent. Total calories were inadequate for all sex and age groups, ranging from 33 to 39 percent below recommendations. Differences in intakes of calories, protein, and iron were significant between those with hemoglobin levels greater than and less than 12 g/100ml for some age group s.

Paper presented at a topical session titled "The Impact of Mercury on the Global Environment" at the 2000 Annual Meeting of the Geological Society of America, held in Reno, Nevada.  aThe Palawan Quicksilver mine, Philippines, produced about 2,900 t of mercury during mining of cinnabar ore from 1953 to 1976. More than 2,000,000 t of mine-waste calcines (retorted ore) were produced during mining, much of which were used to construct a jetty in nearby Honda Bay. Since 1995, high Hg contents have been found in several people living near the mine, and 21 of these people were treated for mercury poisoning. Samples of mine-waste calcine contain high total Hg concentrations ranging from 43-660 microgram/g, whereas total Hg concentrations in sediment samples collected from a mine pit lake and local stream vary from 3.7-400 microgram/g. Mine water flowing through the calcines is acidic, pH 3.1-4.3, and total Hg concentrations ranging from 18-31 microgram/l in this water significantly exceed the 1.0-microgram/l drinking water standard for Hg recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO). Total Hg contents are generally lower in water samples collected from surrounding domestic wells, the mine pit lake, Honda Bay, and the nearby stream, varying from 0.008-1.4 microgram/l. Methylmercury concentrations in water draining mine calcines range from <0.02-1.4 ng/l, but methylmercury is highest in the pit lake water, ranging from 1.7 3.1 ng/l. Mercury methylation at the Palawan mine is similar to or higher than that found in other mercury mines worldwide. Much of the methylmercury generated in Palawan mine-waste calcines and those in Honda Bay is transferred to water, and then to marine fish and seafood. A food source pathway of Hg to humans is most likely in this coastal, high fish-consuming population. 3amine spoil 3aPhilippines 0acontamination 0acontaminants1 aGreaves, I.A.1 aBustos, D.M.1 aKrabbenhoft, D.P.0 tEnvironmental geology.g2003 Jan., v. 43, no. 3 p.298-307aEnvironmental geology (New York, N.Y. : 1993)x1073-91067nnas  aDNAL  a20030508b20030509c00000000  aINDdGK1  aNon-US 7aarticle03301naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127072001700144100001800161245013100179300001600310500001500326520188200341650002102223650002202244650002302266650001902289650001102308650003002319650002202349650002802371650003602399650001602435650002002451650002102471651001102492653002802503700001502531700001802546700001602564773007002580852000902650856009102659930003302750945002502783946001102808655001202819IND4399750020221118064338.0080107e200710  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439975002DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Fifteen commercial broiler chicken flocks were vaccinated twice against NDV and once against IBDV. Clinical signs of Newcastle disease appeared at 23-25 days of age, mortality and morbidity rates were 30-50% and 65-75% respectively. IBDV maternal derived antibody levels were determined at one day old using commercial Enzyme linked immunossorbant assay (ELISA) kit. Samples of bursas of Fabricius in acute stage were collected and evaluated histologically and the average bursa/body weight ratios were calculated and analyzed statistically. Newcastle disease virus antibody levels at acute and convalescent stages of disease were determined using hemagglutination inhibition (HI) test. Tracheas were also collected in the acute stage for performing NDV reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). ELISA results at 1 day of age indicated that all tested flocks had low IBD maternal antibody titers. Histopathological examination of the bursas of Fabricius showed lesions characteristic of subclinical IBDV infection, ranged from moderate to severe lymphoid depletion of follicular lymphocytes, or minimal to absence of follicular lymphocytic presence as a sequel to necrosis. The HI titers for NDV from acute and convalescent sera were 1.9 to 3.3 and 5.3 to 6.9 respectively. Newcastle disease gene was also confirmed in tracheas using RT-PCR test. The results obtained from this study indicate that subclinical IBDV infection at an early age is a significant cause of decreased immune response to NDV vaccine, therefore leading to NDV infection in commercial broiler chicken flocks despite the fact that these flocks were vaccinated twice against NDV. 3abroiler chickens 3aNewcastle disease 3abursa of Fabricius 3adisease course 3aflocks 3ainfectious bursal disease 3adisease outbreaks 3aAvian orthoavulavirus 1 3aInfectious bursal disease virus 3avaccination 3aimmune response 3acommercial farms 3aJordan 0aNewcastle disease virus1 aHaddad, R.1 aKhawaldeh, G.1 aShaheen, I.0 pJ. poult. scig2007 Oct., v. 44, no. 4 p.446-452x1346-73957nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/browse/jpsa/-char/en/3Available from publisher's Web site  a20080415b20080502c00000000  aINDd3CTe2008/03/26  aNon-US 7aarticle01467naa a2200409 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024001800097024003600115040001800151100001600169245010700185300001600292520014300308650001700451650001900468650001000487650003600497650006500533650001100598650007000609650000900679650001700688650003100705653002300736700001600759700001700775773008100792852000900873856008600882939003300968945000801001946001301009990002301022655001201045991630026830742620221118064208.0830609e198212  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aPAR830057902DNAL7 a71430702pmid7 a10.3171/jns.1982.57.6.08372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVaquero, J.10aGrowth of hydatid cysts evaluated by CT scanning after presumed cerebral hydatid embolism.

The results showed that the greatest hurdle to acetic acid bacteria growth is the high sugar concentration, since the majority of the isolated strains are inhibited by 25% of glucose. Sugar tolerance is an important technological trait because Traditional Balsamic Vinegar is made with concentrated cooked must. On the contrary, ethanol concentration of the cooked and fermented must is less significant for acetic acid bacteria growth. A tentative identification of the isolated strains was done by 16S-23S-5S rDNA PCR/RFLP technique and the isolated strains were clustered: 32 strains belong to Gluconacetobacter xylinus group, two strains to Acetobacter pasteurianus group and one to Acetobacter aceti. 3arestriction fragment length polymorphism 3aacetic acid bacteria 3avinegars 3apolymerase chain reaction 3afood microbiology 3amolecular systematics 3atraditional foods 3acooking 3aethanol 3aglucose tolerance 3agrape must 0acooked must 0afermented foods 0aisolation1 aCaggia, C.1 aDe Vero, L.1 aGiudici, P.0 tInternational journal of food microbiology.g2006 Feb. 1, v. 106, no. 2 p.209-212dElsevier Sciencex0168-16057nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijfoodmicro.2005.06.0243electronic resource  a20060713b20060804c00000000  aINDdPNNe2006/07/13  aNon-US 7aarticle03543naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024003000133040001800163072000900181100002900190245009800219300001800317500002400335506007600359520159900435506003702034650002302071650001202094650002602106650001702132650001402149650001702163650002602180650001102206650003102217650001602248650002002264650001802284650002602302650002402328650001302352650006802365650002402433650003602457653002502493653003002518700002302548700002002571773013302591852000902724856008002733856006902813930003302882945002502915946001302940655001202953IND4380768820221207144537.0060607e200606  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438076882DNAL7 a167515412pmid7 aPMC14896752pmcid7 a10.1128/AEM.00448-062doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ1211 aGanesan, Balasubramanian10aIdentification of the Leucine-to-2-Methylbutyric Acid Catabolic Pathway of Lactococcus lactis  ap. 4264-4273.  aIncludes references  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aNutrient starvation and nonculturability in bacteria lead to changes in metabolism not found during the logarithmic phase. Substrates alternate to those used during growth are metabolized in these physiological states, yielding secondary metabolites. In firmicutes and actinobacteria, amino acid catabolic pathways are induced during starvation and nonculturability. Examination of lactococci showed that the population entered a nonculturable state after carbohydrate depletion and was incapable of growth on solid media; however, the cells gained the ability to produce branched-chain fatty acids from amino acids. Gene expression profiling and in silico pathway analysis coupled with nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy were used to delineate the leucine catabolic pathway. Lactococci produced acetic and propionic acid during logarithmic growth and starvation. At the onset of nonculturability, 2-methylbutyric acid was produced via hydroxymethyl-glutaryl-coenzyme A (CoA) and acetyl-CoA, along with ATP and oxidation/reduction precursors. Gene expression profiling and genome sequence analysis showed that lactococci contained redundant genes for branched-chain fatty acid production that were regulated by an unknown mechanism linked to carbon metabolism. This work demonstrated the ability of a firmicute to induce new metabolic capabilities in the nonculturable state for producing energy and intermediates needed for transcription and translation. Phylogenetic analyses showed that homologues of these enzymes and their functional motifs were widespread across the domains of life.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aLactococcus lactis 3aleucine 3aamino acid metabolism 3abiosynthesis 3abutyrates 3acell culture 3anutrient deficiencies 3asugars 3abranched chain fatty acids 3ametabolites 3agene expression 3amessenger RNA 2aButyratesxmetabolism 2aGlucosexmetabolism 2aKinetics 2aLactococcus lactisxcytologyxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aLeucinexmetabolism 2aMagnetic Resonance Spectroscopy 0a2-methylbutyric acid 0agene expression profiling1 aDobrowolski, Piotr1 aWeimer, Bart C.0 tApplied and environmental microbiology.g2006 June, v. 72, no. 6 p.4264-4273dAmerican Society for Microbiologyx0099-22407nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1128/AEM.00448-063Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://aem.asm.org/contents-by-date.0.shtml3electronic resource  a20060724b20060804c00000000  aINDdRHFe2006/07/20  aOther US 7aarticle04258naa a2200757 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024003000133040001800163072000900181072000900190100002900199245010300228300001800331500002400349500001500373506007600388520176200464506003702226650002502263650001802288650001902306650001802325650001802343650001602361650003002377650002002407650001002427650002502437650001902462650001502481650002202496650001602518650001502534650001902549650007402568650003402642650001602676650002902692650004002721650001302761650002802774650001402802650005002816650003002866650003402896653003702930653001702967653003002984653002803014700002003042700002003062700002103082700002303103773013303126852000903259856008003268856006903348930003303417945002503450946001303475655001203488IND4380766520221207141253.0060607e200606  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438076652DNAL7 a167515182pmid7 aPMC14896062pmcid7 a10.1128/AEM.02969-052doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aW000 0aJ1001 aNí Chadhain, Sinéad M.10aMicrobial Dioxygenase Gene Population Shifts during Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbon Biodegradation  ap. 4078-4087.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe degradation of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) by bacteria has been widely studied. While many pure cultures have been isolated and characterized for their ability to grow on PAHs, limited information is available on the diversity of microbes involved in PAH degradation in the environment. We have designed generic PCR primers targeting the gene fragment encoding the Rieske iron sulfur center common to all PAH dioxygenase enzymes. These Rieske primers were employed to track dioxygenase gene population shifts in soil enrichment cultures following exposure to naphthalene, phenanthrene, or pyrene. PAH degradation was monitored by gas chromatograph with flame ionization detection. DNA was extracted from the enrichment cultures following PAH degradation. 16S rRNA and Rieske gene fragments were PCR amplified from DNA extracted from each enrichment culture and an unamended treatment. The PCR products were cloned and sequenced. Molecular monitoring of the enrichment cultures before and after PAH degradation using denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and 16S rRNA gene libraries suggests that specific phylotypes of bacteria were associated with the degradation of each PAH. Sequencing of the cloned Rieske gene fragments showed that different suites of genes were present in soil microbe populations under each enrichment culture condition. Many of the Rieske gene fragment sequences fell into clades which are distinct from the reference dioxygenase gene sequences used to design the PCR primers. The ability to profile not only the bacterial community but also the dioxygenases which they encode provides a powerful tool for both assessing bioremediation potential in the environment and for the discovery of novel dioxygenase genes.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3apyrene (hydrocarbon) 3asoil bacteria 3asoil pollution 3aribosomal RNA 3aphenanthrenes 3aDNA primers 3apolymerase chain reaction 3agene expression 3agenes 3anucleotide sequences 3abiodegradation 3aloam soils 3aspecies diversity 3anaphthalene 3aoxygenases 3apolluted soils 2aBacteriaxclassificationxgeneticsxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aBiodegradation, Environmental 2aDNA Primers 2aDNA, Ribosomalxgenetics 2aDioxygenasesxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aKinetics 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPhylogeny 2aPolycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbonsxmetabolism. 2aPolymerase Chain Reaction 2aRNA, Ribosomal, 16Sxgenetics 0apolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons 0aphenanthrene 0aRieske iron sulfur center 0amolecular sequence data1 aNorman, R.

Paper presented at a topical session titled "The Impact of Mercury on the Global Environment" at the 2000 Annual Meeting of the Geological Society of America, held in Reno, Nevada.  aSan Pablo Bay is an estuary, within northern San Francisco Bay, containing elevated sediment mercury (Hg) levels because of historic loading of hydraulic mining debris during the California gold-rush of the late 1800s. A preliminary investigation of benthic microbial Hg cycling was conducted in surface sediment (0-4 cm) collected from one salt-marsh and three open-water sites. A deeper profile (0-26 cm) was evaluated at one of the open-water locations. Radiolabeled model Hg-compounds were used to measure rates of both methylmercury (MeHg) production and degradation by bacteria. While all sites and depths had similar total-Hg concentrations (0.3-0.6 ppm), and geochemical signatures of mining debris (as epsilondNd, range: -3.08 to -4.37), in-situ MeHg was highest in the marsh (5.4 +/- 3.5 ppb) and less than or equal to 0.7 ppb in all open-water sites. Microbial MeHg production (potential rate) in 0-4 surface sediments was also highest in the marsh (3.1 ng g-1 wet sediment day-1) and below detection (<0.06 ng g-1 wet sediment day-1) in open-water locations. The marsh exhibited a methylation/demethylation (M/D) ratio more than 25x that of all open-water locations. Only below the surface 0-4-cm horizon was significant MeHg production potential evident in the open-water sediment profile (0.2-1.1 ng g-1 wet sediment day-1). In-situ Hg methylation rates, calculated from radiotracer rate constants, and in-situ inorganic Hg(II) concentrations compared well with potential rates. However, similarly calculated in-situ rates of MeHg degradation were much lower than potential rates. These preliminary data indicate that wetlands surrounding San Pablo Bay represent important zones of MeHg production, more so than similarly Hg-contaminated adjacent open-water areas. This has significant implications for this and other Hg-impacted systems, where wetland expansion is currently planned. 3awetlands 3amercury 3amethylation 3asediments 3amethylmercury compounds 3aCalifornia 0acontaminants 0aopen water 0amercury methylation 0apelagic sediment1 aAgee, J.L.1 aBouse, R.M.1 aJaffe, B.E.0 tEnvironmental geology.g2003 Jan., v. 43, no. 3 p.260-267aEnvironmental geology (New York, N.Y. : 1993)x1073-91067nnas  aDNAL  a20030508b20030509c00000000  aINDdGK1  aNon-US 7aarticle02543naa a2200301 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245009200127300001600219520164400235650001301879650001601892650003001908650001501938650001501953650003001968651002501998653001202023773012802035852000902163930003302172945001302205946001102218655001202229IND2331303220221118062528.0030311e200212  gw |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233130322DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAl-Zabet, T.10aEvaluation of aquifer vulnerability to contamination potential using the DRASTIC method  ap. 203-208.  aThe unconfined shallow aquifer in the Eastern District of Abu Dhabi Emirate in the United Arab Emirates is showing signs of contamination from a wide variety of non-point sources (NPS). Assessing the fate and behavior of the NPS pollutants is a complex environmental problem due to heterogeneity of the subsurface system and the spread of NPS over large areas in relatively low concentrations. Vulnerability maps are used in this case as a tool to determine areas where groundwater protection or monitoring is critical. One of the widely used groundwater vulnerability mapping methods is DRASTIC. In the DRASTIC method, seven hydrogeological data layers are required, i.e., depth to groundwater, net recharge, soil texture, topography (slope), lithology of vadose zone, lithology of the aquifer, and hydraulic conductivity. For each cell, the DRASTIC rating for each input layer was multiplied by the DRASTIC and pesticide DRASTIC weight for that layer and summed to determine the DRASTIC index. The resulting pesticide DRASTIC vulnerability map indicates that the highest potential sites for contamination are along the area between the Jabel Hafit and Oman Mountains and in the northwest of the study area. To the northeast there is a small, rounded area which shows fairly high potential. Elsewhere, low to medium DRASTIC index values are observed, indicating areas of low vulnerability potential. The general DRASTIC index indicates that the potential for polluting groundwater is low. The pesticide DRASTIC index shows that the potential for polluting groundwater with pesticides is greater than with general DRASTIC index pollutants. 3aaquifers 3agroundwater 3agroundwater contamination 3apollutants 3apesticides 3anonpoint source pollution 3aUnited Arab Emirates 0amapping0 tEnvironmental geology.g2002 Dec., v. 43, no. 1/2 p.203-208aEnvironmental geology (New York, N.Y. : 1993)x1073-91067nnas  aDNAL  a20030401b20030408c00000000  aINDdGK1  aNon-US 7aarticle02276naa a2200277 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245018800126300001600314520137500330650001601705651001201721700001701733700001401750700001401764700001501778773012701793852000901920930003301929945001301962946001101975655001201986IND2330045920221118062459.0021210e200209  gw |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233004592DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHsissou, Y.10aUse of chemical tracing to study acquisition modalities of the mineralization and behaviour of unconfined groundwaters under a semi-arid climate: the case of the Souss plain (Morocco)  ap. 672-680.  aThe chemical content of the Souss unconfined groundwater displays spatial variations in conductivity (between 400 and 6,000 microSiemens cm-1). The chemical tracers (Cl-, SO4(-2), Sr2+, Br-), which characterize the different components of the groundwater, allowed the determination of the origin of water salinity. Cl- and SO4(-2), reaching respectively 2,000 and 1,650 mg L-1, display localized salinity anomalies. Br-/Cl- ratio distinguishes marine-influenced impoverished zones versus the oceanic domain. Thus, salinity anomalies can be attributed: (1) downstream, to a currently existing salt-encroachment (with added waste water) and sedimentary palaeosalinity, (2) in the middle-Souss, to High Atlas evaporites and to irrigation water recycling. Sr2+/Ca2+ ratio (evaporites if >1 per thousand), confirms the evaporitic origin of the anomalies along the right bank of oued Souss. Furthermore, it facilitates the distinction between the different aquifer contributions (Cretaceous, Jurassic and Triassic), and it highlights leakage from deep Turonian limestones in the groundwater recharge system. To the south, recharge is from the Anti Atlas (evaporite-free) waters. Oxygen-18 measurements confirm the groundwater recharge from the High and Anti Atlas as piezometric maps and chemical tracers suggested, plus from leakage from the Turonian and the marine aquifers. 3agroundwater 3aMorocco1 aBouchaou, L.1 aMudry, J.1 aMania, J.1 aChauve, P.0 tEnvironmental geology.g2002 Sept., v. 42, no. 6 p.672-680aEnvironmental geology (New York, N.Y. : 1993)x1073-91067nnas  aDNAL  a20030304b20030311c00000000  aINDdGK1  aNon-US 7aarticle02589naa a2200277 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001400110245009200124300001600216520177900232650001902011650001602030650001502046700001502061700001502076700001502091773012702106852000902233930003302242945001302275946001102288655001202299IND2330045620221118062727.0021210e200209  gw |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233004562DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKim, J.G.10aReduction of hexavalent chromium by pyrite-rich andesite in different anionic solutions  ap. 642-648.  aIntroduction of Cr(VI) to the environment has been of environmental concern due to its toxicity and mobility. In treatment processes for wastewater, groundwater, and soil contaminated with Cr(VI), the reduction of Cr(VI) to Cr(III) and the subsequent precipitation of insoluble Cr(III) compounds are generally employed. Finely ground, hydrothermally altered andesite containing 11.8% of pyrite reacted with Cr(VI) solutions (0 to 400 mg l-1) in the presence of dissolved oxygen and 0.01 to 0.1 M of KCl, K2SO4, and KH2PO4. Before and after the reaction, the morphology of the pyrite was also examined with a scanning electron microscope. The altered andesite was an effective Cr reductant in KCl and K2SO solutions, but KH2PO decreased the Cr(VI) reduction capacity of the altered andesite. The higher the initial concentration of Cr(VI), the more Cr(VI) reduced to Cr(III) in KCl and K2SO4 solutions, but no relationship between the initial concentration of Cr(VI) and the amount of reduced Cr(VI) in KH2PO solutions was observed. The final solution pH for KCl and K2SO4 increased with an increasing initial concentration of Cr(VI). For KH2PO4, the pH was not significantly changed by changing the initial concentration of Cr(VI), but it did increase with an increasing KH2PO4 concentration. A concentration of aqueous ferrous iron [Fe(II)] nonstoichiometrically decreased with an increasing amount of reduced Cr. The changes in solution pH and concentrations of Fe(II) and Cr(VI) indicate that the reduction of Cr(VI), both at solid-solution interface and in solution, occurred simultaneously. Pyrite had relatively smooth surfaces and sharp edges before the Cr reduction, but showed rough surfaces, dissolution pits on surfaces, and smoothed edges after the Cr reduction. 3apolluted soils 3agroundwater 3awastewater1 aJung, P.K.1 aMoon, H.S.1 aChon, C.M.0 tEnvironmental geology.g2002 Sept., v. 42, no. 6 p.642-648aEnvironmental geology (New York, N.Y. : 1993)x1073-91067nnas  aDNAL  a20030304b20030311c00000000  aINDdGK1  aNon-US 7aarticle01709naa a2200289 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245012800127300001600255520082300271650001701094650001401111650002001125650002001145651001001165653002201175700001801197773012601215852000901341930003301350945001301383946001101396655001201407IND2328397720221118062609.0020807e200203  gw |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232839772DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNagaraju, A.10aAccumulation of elements in plants and soils in and around Nellore mica belt, Andhra Pradesh, India--a biogeochemical study  ap. 852-860.  aThe accumulation of elements in three dominant plant species, Jatropha curcas, Dodonea viscosa and Cassia auriculata, and their associated soils were studied.

The BAC is the ratio of the concentration of an element in plant ash to that of its substrate. The results show the presence and/or absence of some elements in plants and soils, which can be explained on the basis of biogeochemical cycling of elements.

Laboratory column experiments  ap. 922-932.  a2019-12-05  aThis paper deals with sorption and anaerobic biodegradation of the soluble aromatic fraction of jet fuel and how it is influenced by porewater velocity during transport in a groundwater aquifer. The study was carried out as controlled laboratory column experiments. A binary mixture of toluene and 1,2,4-trimethylbenzene with a concentration ratio of 2:1 was used through the entire investigations. The column experiments were conducted with contaminated sediments and groundwater, taken from wells at a field research site. The columns were operated anaerobically under continuous-flow conditions at 10 degrees C in a temperature-controlled refrigerator. Two percent sodium azide was added to the injection solution of two of the columns to prevent biodegradation of the studied organic mixture. Chloride was used as a conservative tracer to characterize the hydrodynamic parameters such as dispersivity and porosity of the columns. The results showed that both compounds in the mixture were attenuated because of sorption and biodegradation processes in the columns. 1,2,4-trimethylbenzene was attenuated more significantly than toluene. Biodegradation of toluene was coupled mainly with the microbial reduction of ferric iron, whereas 1,2,4-trimethylbenzene, in contrast, was mostly sorbed. Their sorption and biodegradation were studied with different pore-water velocities, and a mass balance approach was applied to calculate biodegradation rates. The biodegradation rates of toluene were -0.16, -0.21, and -0.26 (unit: mM day-1) for pore-water velocities of 96, 82.4, and 54.9 (unit: cm day-1), respectively. This indicates that a decrease in the pore-water velocity significantly enhanced the biodegradation of toluene, consistent with other reports in the literature. For 1,2,4-trimethylbenzene the biodegradation rates were -0.05, -0.13 (unit: mM day-1) for pore-water velocities of 96 and 82.4 (unit: cm day-1), respectively. The biodegradation rate of 1,2,4-trimethylbenzene did not increase at the lowest pore water velocity as expected. This might be a result of substrate competition. 3apetroleum 3aaromatic hydrocarbons 0ahydrocarbons 0acontaminants1 aAagaard, P.1 aBreedveld, G.D.0 tEnvironmental geology.g2002 Apr., v. 41, no. 8 p.922-932aEnvironmental geology (New York, N.Y. : 1993)x1073-91067nnas  aDNAL  a20021104b20021107c00000000  aINDdGK1  aNon-US 7aarticle01754naa a2200253 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002500110245007100135300001800206520100900224650001201233651001101245700001901256700001701275773013001292852000901422930003301431945001301464946001101477655001201488IND2326314520221118062703.0020402e200109  gw |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232631452DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPlaner-Friedrich, B.10aOrigin of arsenic in the groundwater of the Rioverde basin, Mexico  ap. 1290-1298.  aGroundwater in the semiarid Rioverde basin in the northern part of Mexico was investigated with respect to major and minor elements including arsenic, as well as As(III) and As(V). The total arsenic concentrations varied from less than 5 to 50 g/L. The in situ arsenic determination method produced reliable results with deviations from -5.6 to 2.2 g/L compared to laboratory HGAAS. Since arsenic and barium were found to be inversely correlated, it was suspected that precipitation of barium arsenate controlled arsenic solubility. Thermodynamically modeling by means of PHREEQC indicated that BaHAsO4(.)H2O (not BaAsO4) might be a limiting phase, however only at higher concentrations than those determined in this study. Increased arsenic groundwater concentrations were found with lacustrine sediments and decreased concentrations with fluvial Quaternary sediments. Increased total arsenic concentrations correlate with increased As(III) concentrations in the groundwater of the lacustrine sediments. 3aarsenic 3aMexico1 aArmienta, M.A.1 aMerkel, B.J.0 tEnvironmental geology.g2001 Sept., v. 40, no. 10 p.1290-1298aEnvironmental geology (New York, N.Y. : 1993)x1073-91067nnas  aDNAL  a20020602b20020610c00000000  aINDdGK1  aNon-US 7aarticle01753naa a2200241 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001900110245009300129300001600222520102300238651001101261700001901272700001701291773012501308852000901433930003301442945001301475946001101488655001201499IND2322504320221118062638.0010813e200105  gw |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232250432DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHygelund, B.N.10aTracing the source of mercury contamination in the Dorena Lake watershed, Western Oregon  ap. 853-859.  aAlthough fish in Dorena Lake are contaminated with mercury, the source of pollution in the watershed was unconfirmed until the present study. To trace the mercury to its source, fine-grained sediment samples were collected from the major streams of the watershed. A few samples of mine waste/tailings were also obtained from the Bohemia Mining District where mercury was historically used in processing gold and silver ore. Mercury concentrations in sediment from streams that do not drain the central mining district average 0.066 ppm, whereas samples taken downstream of the district contain 0.140-1.339 ppm. Mine waste/tailings contain 13.441 to >50 ppm mercury. The source of mercury contamination in the Dorena Lake watershed is thus the Bohemia Mining District. Historical and geological evidence strongly suggests that the mercury problem in the district resulted from gold-mercury amalgamation practices, but naturally high mercury content in mineralized areas cannot be ruled out with the data presented here. 3aOregon1 aAmbers, R.K.R.1 aAmbers, C.P.0 tEnvironmental geology.g2001 May, v. 40, no. 7 p.853-859aEnvironmental geology (New York, N.Y. : 1993)x1073-91067nnas  aDNAL  a20010929b20011005c00000000  aINDdGK1  aNon-US 7aarticle03229naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004300092040001800135072000900153100001600162245009600178300001400274500002400288500001500312520168200327650002202009650002802031650001202059650002802071650001402099650003002113650001402143650001802157650001902175650002402194650002102218650002602239650002002265650001502285650001002300650001302310650002302323653002802346653002302374653001402397700001302411773012002424852000902544856007702553930003302630945002502663946001102688655001202699IND4380692120221118062503.0060606e20051115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438069212DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijfoodmicro.2005.05.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ2051 aCocolin, L.10aUse of a culture-independent molecular method to study the ecology of Yersinia spp. in food  ap. 71-82.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aA culture-independent method for the direct detection in food of Yersinia spp. was developed in this study. It is based on the amplification of a 359 bp PCR product from the RNA polymerase beta-subunit gene (rpoB) and subsequent analysis by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE). Direct detection of Yersinia spp. by PCR-DGGE was carried out in ready-to-eat vegetables and the results compared with the results of the traditional, culture-dependent method. The DGGE profiles were determined to be species-specific. As a matter of fact, Yersinia enterocolitica, Yersinia intermedia, Yersinia frederiskenii and Yersinia kristensenii showed differential migrations in the gels. Moreover, Y. enterocolitica serotypes O:3, O:5 and O:9 were distinguishable, as well. Only for a limited number of traditionally isolated strains, the biochemical and molecular identification agree. In particular, an overestimation of Y. enterocolitica, as determined biochemically, was observed. Finally when the protocol was applied to 27 food samples, a good correlation was obtained when the results of traditional and direct methods were analyzed. The molecular method was able to identify Y. enterocolitica, not detected by plating analysis. However, for 4 samples, that, by plating analysis, were determined to contain Yersinia spp., no PCR product could be obtained after enrichment, probably due to low numbers of target cells, thereby not allowing the possibility to perform DGGE analysis. The protocol described here represents a reliable tool for the detection of Yersinia spp. in food, which can be used to obtain the needed results faster than with traditional culturing methods. 3asequence analysis 3abacterial contamination 3abiofilm 3apsychrotrophic bacteria 3aserotypes 3apolymerase chain reaction 3avirulence 3arapid methods 3afood pathogens 3amicrobial detection 3amicrobial growth 3amolecular systematics 3afresh-cut foods 3avegetables 3agenes 3aYersinia 3aready-to-eat foods 0amolecular sequence data 0amolecular genetics 0aisolation1 aComi, G.0 tInternational journal of food microbiology.g2005 Nov. 15, v. 105, no. 1 p.71-82dElsevier Sciencex0168-16057nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijfoodmicro.2005.05.0063electronic resource  a20060628b20060702c00000000  aINDdPNNe2006/06/28  aNon-US 7aarticle03378naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127072000900145072000900154072000900163100001700172245015500189300001600344500002400360520200100384650002502385650002002410650001202430650002002442650001502462650002102477650002102498650002002519650002402539650002902563650002002592650002802612650001102640700001902651773010302670852000902773856006902782930003302851945002502884946001102909655001202920IND4380686020221118062547.0060606e200601  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438068602DNAL7 a10.1007/s11104-005-2360-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF600 0aF500 0aJ5001 aO'Dell, R.E.10aSerpentine and nonserpentine Achillea millefolium accessions differ in serpentine substrate tolerance and response to organic and inorganic amendments  ap. 253-269.  aIncludes references  aSubgrade serpentine substrates are exceptionally difficult to revegetate due to multiple limitations including low N, P, and K, low Ca:Mg molar ratios, high levels of heavy metals including Ni, Cr, and Co, low organic matter, low CEC, and low water holding capacity. To examine the influence of plant origin on the success of the revegetation of serpentine substrates, granite and serpentine accessions of Achillea millefolium were grown on subgrade serpentine substrate amended with yard waste compost, slow-release NPK fertilizer, and/or CaSO₄ · 2H₂O (gypsum). The goals of this study were to: (1) identify the substrate amendment combination that maximized establishment of A. millefolium on serpentine substrate, (2) compare seedling establishment, survival, and growth of the serpentine and granite A. millefolium accessions in order to determine if a serpentine edaphic ecotype of A. millefolium exists and if this ecotype is superior to the granite accession for the establishment of vegetation on serpentine substrate and (3) if a serpentine edaphic ecotype of A. millefolium does exist, what physiological features with respect to mineral nutrition convey a higher tolerance of serpentine for this ecotype than the nonserpentine ecotype. Seedling establishment, survival, and growth were greatest for A. millefolium when the subgrade serpentine substrate was amended with 30% (v/v) compost and 220 mg kg substrate-¹ each of N, P, and K. The serpentine A. millefolium accession displayed a greater tolerance of the subgrade serpentine substrate, serpentine topsoil, and the amended subgrade serpentine substrate than the granite accession. Higher capacity of the serpentine A. millefolium accession for selective Ca translocation from roots to the shoot resulted in a significantly higher shoot Ca:Mg molar ratio than the granite accession and appeared to be the most important physiological feature conveying greater tolerance of the serpentine accession for serpentine substrates. 3aAchillea millefolium 3aseedling growth 3abiomass 3aplant nutrition 3aserpentine 3aserpentine soils 3aland restoration 3asoil amendments 3ayard waste composts 3aslow-release fertilizers 3aNPK fertilizers 3asoil-plant interactions 3agypsum1 aClaassen, V.P.0 tPlant and soil.g2006 Jan., v. 279, no. 1-2 p.253-269dKluwer Academic Publishersx0032-079X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11104-005-2360-y3electronic resource  a20061210b20070102c00000000  aINDdRSCe2006/07/12  aNon-US 7aarticle03239naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092040001800119072000900137100001600146245012800162300001800290500002400308520188900332650001802221650002502239650001902264650001302283650001502296650002002311650001802331650002502349653001902374653003802393653002902431700002502460700001302485773016202498852000902660856007702669930003302746945002502779946001302804655001202817IND4380698420221118062559.0060606e20060517xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438069842DNAL7 a10.1021/jf05276052doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aS2001 aTessier, B.10aSelective separation of peptides contained in a rapeseed (Brassica campestris L.) protein hydrolysate using UF/NF membranes  ap. 3578-3584.  aIncludes references  aThe ability of a charged UF membrane to fractionate the small peptides found in a rapeseed protein enzymatic hydrolysate, according to their charge characteristics, was investigated. The complexity of such a hydrolysate has required the setting up of technological alternatives to isolate the small peptides, to obtain a more efficient separation among the numerous peptide species. A preliminary step consisted of precipitation followed by filtration with a 3000 g/mol molecular weight cutoff (MWCO) membrane to obtain a solution concentrated in small peptides. The possibility of fractionating these small peptides by a charged 1000 g/mol MWCO membrane was investigated. The study enabled us to assess the contribution of electrostatic interactions during fractionation. The effect of pH and ionic strength on the peptide transmission was studied. The ionic strength contribution was considered by studying the effect on the selectivity of a desalting step by nanofiltration on a 500 g/mol MWCO membrane. Peptide transmission was lower at pH 9 than pH 4, and it was the lowest at pH 9 and low ionic strength. Ionic strength had a significant influence at pH 9 but showed no influence at pH 4. The amino acid analysis and capillary electrophoresis revealed that negatively charged (acid) peptides were found in lower proportions in the permeate. The opposite trend was observed for basic peptides, whereas neutral peptides were found in the same proportion in the retentate and the permeate. These results can be explained, according to the Donnan theory, by the existence of attractive and repulsive forces at the membrane-solution interface. Selectivity between basic and acid peptides was as high as 1.90 at pH 9 and low ionic strength. A rough sketch of a membrane-based process is proposed to fractionate rapeseed peptide mixtures.

Shellfish consumption has always been one of the major risk factors for hepatitis A infection, especially when these products are eaten raw or slightly cooked. Moreover, the cooking does not always guarantee the harmlessness of shellfish. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the hepatitis A virus (HAV) resistance in experimentally contaminated mussels, subjected to domestic cooking. Three different domestic preparations (mussel hors-d'oevre, mussel au gratin, mussels with tomato sauce) were performed according to the traditional Italian cookery using different time and temperature conditions. To detect HAV-RNA, RT-nested-PCR was used; the presence of the infectious virus in the positive samples was confirmed by an integrated cell culture-RT-PCR method. The infectious virus was completely inactivated only in “mussels in tomato sauce”, while it was still present, even if not quantitatively determinable, in the other preparations. The study confirmed that some factors can influence the HAV sensitivity to thermal inactivation preventing a complete decontamination of the product. 3aheat inactivation 3amussels 3atraditional technology 3aheat tolerance 3ainactivation temperature 3aHepatovirus A 3afood contamination 3apolymerase chain reaction 3aseafoods 3aviral hepatitis 3afood pathogens 3acooking 3ashellfish 3aItaly 0aHepatitis A virus1 aDe Medici, D.1 aDi Pasquale, S.1 aToti, L.0 tInternational journal of food microbiology.g2005 Nov. 25, v. 105, no. 2 p.139-144dElsevier Sciencex0168-16057nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijfoodmicro.2005.04.0083electronic resource  a20060630b20060702c00000000  aINDdPNNe2006/06/29  aNon-US 7aarticle04201naa a2200709 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024002800133040001800161072000900179072000900188072000900197100001100206245014000217300001800357500002400375500001500399506007600414520200700490506003702497650001402534650001102548650002202559650003002581650001402611650001502625650002102640650001502661650001302676650001802689650002702707650002302734650002202757650003002779650002402809650003002833650003302863650002802896650001902924650002902943650003402972653001703006653001303023653001903036653002703055653001803082700001503100700001303115700001703128700002403145773010103169852000903270856007803279856005303357930003303410945002503443946001103468655001203479IND4380680120221207140323.0060606e200606  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438068012DNAL7 a165338312pmid7 aPMC28033982pmcid7 a10.1093/aob/mcl0622doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF831 0aF600 0aF2001 aLi, H.10aEnhanced pathogenicity of Leptosphaeria maculans pycnidiospores from paired co-inoculation of Brassica napus cotyledons with ascospores  ap. 1151-1156.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND AND AIMS: Blackleg, caused by Leptosphaeria maculans, is a major disease of oilseed rape (Brassica napus) worldwide, including Australia. In most cases, the severity of the disease in the field is related to infections caused by airborne ascospores. In contrast, pycnidiospores originating from leaf and stem lesions and stubble are widely assumed to play only a relatively minor role in the epidemiology of blackleg. It is not clear whether, under certain conditions, pycnidiospores can cause severe disease in the field. The aim of the work reported was to determine if the pathogenicity of pycnidiospores is enhanced by paired co-inoculation of B. napus cotyledons with ascospores. METHODS: Three investigations were carried out under controlled-environment conditions using various L. maculans isolates and B. napus cultivars with different levels of host resistance to blackleg. KEY RESULTS: In all three experiments, co-inoculation with ascospores increased the ability of pycnidiospores to cause more disease on B. napus than when inoculations consisted of pycnidiospores alone. This effect was significantly influenced by the host resistance of the cultivar, but overall was independent of the L. maculans isolate used in the different experiments. This effect was also independent of timing of inoculation with the ascospores, with increased disease from pycnidiospores occurring on the cotyledon of the seedling in situations where inoculations with ascospores were carried out 0, 1 or 2 d after pycnidiospore inoculation. This enhanced pathogenicity of pycnidiospores was evident even when low concentrations of pycnidiospores were applied to the other cotyledon of the same seedling. CONCLUSIONS: These results may explain continuing severe blackleg disease cycles throughout the cropping season even when ascospore fallout was low or constrained only to a brief period or phase of the cropping season, and suggest that disease epidemics may be polycyclic rather than monocyclic.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3acultivars 3acanola 3aPlenodomus lingam 3afungal diseases of plants 3aseedlings 3aascospores 3ainoculum density 3acotyledons 3apycnidia 3apathogenicity 3aplant pathogenic fungi 3adisease resistance 3agenetic variation 3aBrassica napus var. napus 3ainoculation methods 2aAscomycotaxpathogenicity 2aBrassica napusxmicrobiology 2aCotyledonxmicrobiology 2aPlant Diseases 2aSeedlingsxmicrobiology. 2aSpores, Fungalxpathogenicity 0aepidemiology 0asymptoms 0apycnidiospores 0aLeptosphaeria maculans 0afungal spores1 aTapper, N.1 aDean, N.1 aBarbetti, M.1 aSivasithamparam, K.0 tAnnals of botany.g2006 June, v. 97, no. 6 p.1151-1156dOxford University Pressx0305-73647nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/aob/mcl0623Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://aob.oupjournals.org/3electronic resource  a20060725b20060804c00000000  aINDdMKSe2006/07/25  aNon-US 7aarticle03330naa a2200649 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024002800133040001800161072000900179072000900188072000900197100001600206245013700222300001800359500002400377500001500401506007600416520134200492506003701834650002201871650001801893650001901911650001201930650000801942650002501950650001201975650001101987650002301998650003202021650001702053650001902070650002702089650002702116650003002143650002202173650002902195650000902224650002302233653001802256653002302274653001602297653001402313700001502327700001602342773010102358852000902459856007802468856005302546930003302599945002502632946001102657655001202668IND4380679920221207141427.0060606e200606  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438067992DNAL7 a166218592pmid7 aPMC28033942pmcid7 a10.1093/aob/mcl0722doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF600 0aF200 0aF4001 aHoshino, Y.10aIsolation of individual egg cells and zygotes in Alstroemeria followed by manual selection with a microcapillary-connected micropump  ap. 1139-1144.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aAIMS: To develop a procedure for isolating living egg cells and zygotes from Alstroemeria ovules. SCOPE: An attempt was made to isolate egg cells and zygotes from the ovules of Alstroemeria aurea. The ovules were histologically observed using a clearing procedure which revealed the localization and sizes of the embryo sacs and egg apparatus within the ovules. For the isolation of egg cells, ovules were cut into sections with a surgical blade and treated with an enzyme solution. Subsequently, these ovule sections were dissected using a glass needle under an inverted microscope. Egg cells successfully isolated by this procedure were collected using microcapillaries connected to a micropump. For zygote isolation, ovules were excised from ovaries 24 h after self-pollination. By treating excised ovules with an enzyme solution and subsequently dissecting them using a glass needle, zygotes were successfully isolated from the ovules and collected with a microcapillary. The isolated zygotes were associated with pollen tubes and one of the synergids. Egg cells and zygotes were viable for up to 2 h following isolation, as determined by fluorescein diacetate staining. CONCLUSIONS: The procedures for isolating egg cells and zygotes in Alstroemeria were established, and each egg cell and zygote was captured with a microcapillary.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aornamental plants 3agene transfer 3aplant breeding 3ahybrids 3aova 3adevelopmental stages 3aflowers 3azygote 3aplant reproduction 3ainterspecific hybridization 3aAlstroemeria 3aultrastructure 3ain vitro fertilization 2aAlstroemeriaxcytology 2aFertilizationxphysiology 2aFlowersxcytology 2aMicrodissectionxmethods 2aOvum 2aPollenxphysiology 0aplant anatomy 0aAlstroemeria aurea 0amethodology 0aisolation1 aMurata, N.1 aShinoda, K.0 tAnnals of botany.g2006 June, v. 97, no. 6 p.1139-1144dOxford University Pressx0305-73647nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/aob/mcl0723Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://aob.oupjournals.org/3electronic resource  a20060725b20060804c00000000  aINDdMKSe2006/07/25  aNon-US 7aarticle03471naa a2200625 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024002800133040001800161072000900179072000900188100001200197245014400209300001800353500002400371500001500395506007600410520145400486506003701940650001001977650001001987650003101997650001402028650001702042650002202059650002202081650002502103650002202128650001102150650002602161650002602187650002302213650004202236650003202278650002802310650003802338650002502376650002302401653004302424653001802467700001302485700001102498700001402509773010102523852000902624856007802633856005302711930003302764945002502797946001102822655001202833IND4380679420221207141421.0060606e200606  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438067942DNAL7 a165338322pmid7 aPMC28034022pmcid7 a10.1093/aob/mcl0592doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF600 0aF4001 aCao, Y.12aA raman-scattering study on the net orientation of biomacromolecules in the outer epidermal walls of mature wheat stems (Triticum aestivum)  ap. 1091-1094.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND AND AIMS: Raman spectroscopy can be used to examine the orientation of biomacromolecules using relatively thick samples of material, whereas more traditional means of analysing molecular structure require prior isolation of the components, which often destroys morphological features. In this study, Raman spectroscopy was used to examine the outer epidermal cell walls of wheat stems. METHODS: Polarized Raman spectra from the epidermal cell walls of wheat stem were obtained using near-infrared-Fourier transform Raman scattering. By comparing spectra taken with Raman light polarized perpendicular or parallel to the longitudinal axis of the cell, the orientation of macromolecules in the cell wall was investigated. KEY RESULTS: The net orientation of macromolecules varies in the epidermal cell walls of the different components of wheat stem. The net orientation of cellulose is parallel to the longitudinal axis of the cells, whereas the xylan and the phenylpropane units of lignin tend to lie perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the cells, i.e. perpendicular to the net orientation of cellulose in the epidermal cell walls. CONCLUSIONS: The results imply that cellulose, lignin and xylan form a relatively ordered network that defines the mechanical and structural properties of the cell wall.

For phreatophytic plants, deep roots are necessary to access the water table, but given that most nutrients in many desert ecosystems are stored in the upper soil layers, viable shallow roots may be equally necessary for nutrient uptake. We sought to better understand the interaction between water and nutrient uptake from soil horizons differing in the relative abundance of these resources. To this end, we monitored plant water and nutrient status before and after applying flood irrigation to four phreatophytic perennial plant species in the remote hyperarid Taklamakan desert in western China. Sap flow in the roots of five plants of the perennial desert species Alhagi sparsifolia Shap., Karelina caspica (Pall.) Less., Calligonum caput medusea Schrenk, and Eleagnus angustifolia Hill. was monitored using the heat ratio method (HRM). Additionally we measured predawn and midday water potential, foliar nitrate reductase activity (NRA), xylem sap nutrient concentration and the concentration of total solutes in the leaves before, 12 and 96 h after flooding to investigate possible short-term physiological effects on water and nutrient status. Rates of sap flow measured during the day and at night in the absence of transpiration did not change after flooding. Moderately high rates of sap flow (HRM heat pulse velocity, 5-25 cm h-¹) detected during the day in soils that had a near zero water content at the surface indicated that all species had contact to groundwater. There was no evidence from sap flow data that plants had utilised flood water to increase maximum rates of transpiration under similar climatic conditions, and there was no evidence of a process to improve the efficiency of water or nutrient uptake, such as hydraulic redistribution (i.e. the passive movement of water from moist soil to very dry soil via roots). Measurements of plant water status, xylem sap nutrient status, foliar NRA and the concentration of osmotically active substances were also unaffected by flood irrigation. Our results clearly show that groundwater acts as the major source of water and nutrients for these plants. The inability of plants to utilise abundant surface soil-water or newly available nutrients following irrigation was attributed to the absence of fine roots in the topsoil layer. 3axerophytes 3aAlhagi 3aplant response 3aphysiological response 3awater potential 3asap flow 3anitrate reductase (NADH) 3aplant nutrition 3asoil horizons 3asoil nutrients 3anitrates 3aammonia 3asulfates 3aphosphates 3anutrient availability 3auptake mechanisms 3aflooded conditions 3aflood irrigation 3asoil water content 3adeserts 3aarid zones 3aplant-water relations 3aChina 0aphreatophytic plants 0aAlhagi sparsifolia 0aKarelina caspica 0aCalligonum caput medusea 0aEleagnus angustifolia1 aBleby, T.M.1 aLandman, P.A.1 aAdams, M.A.1 aArndt, S.K.0 tPlant and soil.g2006 Jan., v. 279, no. 1-2 p.129-139dKluwer Academic Publishersx0032-079X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11104-005-0498-23electronic resource  a20061210b20070102c00000000  aINDdRSCe2006/07/12  aNon-US 7aarticle03038naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127072000900145072000900154072000900163100002000172245014200192300001600334500002400350520171400374650001902088650001902107650001602126650001802142650001702160650001902177650001302196650001202209650001302221650001502234650001502249650002202264650002802286700001602314773010302330852000902433856006902442930003302511945002502544946001102569655001202580IND4380684720221118062641.0060606e200601  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438068472DNAL7 a10.1007/s11104-005-0838-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF500 0aF600 0aJ5001 aMcFarlane, K.J.10aMeasuring nitrogen and phosphorus uptake by intact roots of mature Acer saccharum Marsh., Pinus resinosa Ait., and Picea abies (L.) Karst  ap. 163-172.  aIncludes references  aA common method for measuring uptake by intact roots in situ is the depletion method, wherein intact fine roots are separated from soil and placed in nutrient solution. The difference between initial and final amounts of nutrient in solution is attributed to root uptake. Variations on this method include applying pretreatment solutions, training roots to grow into bags or trays, and varying concentrations of nutrient solution. We tested whether variations in methods affected measured net uptake rates of NH ₄ ⁺ , NO ₃ - , and PO ₄ ³- . Intact roots of 60 year-old sugar maple (Acer saccharum Marsh.), red pine (Pinus resinosa Ait.), and Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.) were given one of four treatments prior to measuring net uptake. “Trained” roots were grown in a sand-soil mixture. “Recovered” roots were excavated and allowed to recover in nutrient solution for two or four days (“two-day recovery” and “four-day recovery”, respectively). “No recovery” roots were excavated and used immediately in experiments. We exposed roots to three concentrations of nutrient solutions to observe the effects of initial nutrient solution concentration. Initial nutrient solution concentration was an important source of variation in measured uptake rates, and N uptake was stimulated by low antecedent concentrations. We found no significant differences in net uptake rates between pretreatments for any of the species studied, indicating that our pretreatments were not effective in improving measurement of uptake. Such pretreatments may not be necessary for measuring net uptake and may not hinder the comparison of rates measured using variations of the depletion method. 3aAcer saccharum 3aPinus resinosa 3aPicea abies 3amature plants 3aroot systems 3asoil nutrients 3anitrogen 3aammonia 3anitrates 3aphosphorus 3aphosphates 3auptake mechanisms 3asoil-plant interactions1 aYanai, R.D.0 tPlant and soil.g2006 Jan., v. 279, no. 1-2 p.163-172dKluwer Academic Publishersx0032-079X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11104-005-0838-23electronic resource  a20061210b20070102c00000000  aINDdRSCe2006/07/12  aNon-US 7aarticle03068naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127072000900145072000900154072000900163072000900172100001300181245015600194300001600350500002400366520160500390650001801995650001202013650002202025650001502047650002002062650001202082650001602094650001902110650001902129650001202148650001902160650000902179650002602188650002602214700001602240700001502256700001502271700001402286773010302300852000902403856006902412930003302481945002502514946001102539655001202550IND4380684520221118062520.0060606e200601  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438068452DNAL7 a10.1007/s11104-005-0616-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aJ500 0aJ200 0aF500 0aF2001 aTang, C.10aInteractions between high pH and iron supply on nodulation and iron nutrition of Lupinus albus L. genotypes differing in sensitivity to iron deficiency  ap. 153-162.  aIncludes references  aPoor growth of white lupin (Lupinus albus L.) on alkaline soils may result from its sensitivity to iron deficiency and poor nodulation. This study examined interactive effects of iron supply and high pH on the growth and nodulation of three genotypes differing in their sensitivity to iron deficiency. Three genotypes (P27486, Ultra and WTD180) were grown for 17 days in buffered solutions with Fe supply of 0.2, 2 and 20 μM. Solution pH was adjusted to 5.2, 6.5 or 7.5. Plant growth, nodulation and nutrient concentrations in plants were measured. Decreasing Fe supply decreased chlorophyll concentration in young leaves by up to 92%. Increasing pH decreased chlorophyll concentration by an average of 40% at pH 6.5 and by 47% at pH 7.5. The decrease of chlorophyll was less obvious in P27485 than in Ultra or WTD180. Shoot biomass was reduced by up to 18% by Fe deficiency, with such decrease being less for P27486. Increasing pH exacerbated the effect of Fe deficiency on shoot biomass only of Ultra. Decreasing Fe supply decreased nodule number by an average of 54%, and increasing pH decreased nodule number by 80%. P27486 formed the greatest number of nodules while WTD180 the least. P27486 had high Fe uptake and low internal requirement. Irrespective of genotype, leaf chlorosis positively correlated with cluster root formation. The results suggest that a combination of Fe deficiency and high pH impaired nodulation in L. albus, and that selection of genotypes for both tolerance of iron deficiency and good nodulation at high pH is important for a successful lupin crop on alkaline soils. 3aLupinus albus 3alegumes 3agenetic variation 3anodulation 3aplant nutrition 3acations 3achlorophyll 3aBradyrhizobium 3aalkaline soils 3asoil pH 3asoil nutrients 3airon 3anutrient availability 3anutrient deficiencies1 aZheng, S.J.1 aQiao, Y.F.1 aWang, G.H.1 aHan, X.Z.0 tPlant and soil.g2006 Jan., v. 279, no. 1-2 p.153-162dKluwer Academic Publishersx0032-079X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11104-005-0616-13electronic resource  a20061210b20070102c00000000  aINDdRSCe2006/07/12  aNon-US 7aarticle02544naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127072000900145072000900154072000900163100001300172245011100185300001600296500002400312520131900336650001801655650001901673650002501692650002601717650001301743650002301756653002801779653003601807653002101843700002001864773010301884852000901987856006901996930003302065945002502098946001102123655001202134IND4380683920221118062549.0060606e200601  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438068392DNAL7 a10.1007/s11104-005-0437-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aJ500 0aJ200 0aX1001 aSato, S.10aAssessing methods for developing phosphorus desorption isotherms from soils using anion exchange membranes  ap. 107-117.  aIncludes references  aDeveloping desorption isotherms for inorganic phosphorus (P) is a time-consuming and non-standardized procedure. Anion exchange membranes (AEMs) have been successfully used in studies of P desorption kinetics and total membrane-desorbable P, but rarely have they been used for developing P desorption isotherms. Our study had two objectives: (1) to evaluate the suitability of using multiple strips of AEMs (termed the Multiple AEM Method) to develop P desorption isotherms; and (2) to compare the Multiple AEM Method with a sequential-extraction approach using AEMs (termed the Sequential AEM Method) to determine if the manner in which AEMs were used would influence the slope of the desorption isotherm, i.e. the partition coefficient. Both methods yielded well-defined, but numerically different desorption isotherms for all levels of sorbed P. However, estimated K d values among methods were equivalent in the low and medium levels of P sorbed. The Multiple AEM method was quicker than the Sequential AEM method, but both gave similar K d values in an agriculturally significant range of soil solution concentrations. These methods should be tested on a range of soil type to determine their suitability in developing P desorption isotherms and to move toward method standardization for desorption isotherms. 3asoil solution 3asoil nutrients 3ainorganic phosphorus 3anutrient availability 3akinetics 3astatistical models 0aanion exchange membrane 0aphosphorus desorption isotherms 0aFreundlich model1 aComerford, N.B.0 tPlant and soil.g2006 Jan., v. 279, no. 1-2 p.107-117dKluwer Academic Publishersx0032-079X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11104-005-0437-23electronic resource  a20061210b20070102c00000000  aINDdRSCe2006/07/12  aNon-US 7aarticle01482naa a2200325 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024003800097040001800135100001700153245006900170300001400239520053900253650002500792650002400817650001200841651001200853653001300865653002600878700001700904700001600921773009500937852000901032856005101041939003301092945000801125946001101133655001201144991630006940742620221118062624.0850123e198408  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aADL850002842DNAL7 a10.1016/0304-3800(84)90055-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLorber, M.N.10aModeling and analysis of waterhyacinth biomass [Eutrophic lakes]  ap. 61-77.  aA model of waterhyacinth growth and yield was developed, calibrated, and validated for Florida conditions.

Another strategy evaluated, in which the waterhyacinths were harvested at a uniform rate all year, had a maximum yield of 48 t/ha. 3aEichhornia crassipes 3amathematical models 3amethane 3aFlorida 0aanalysis 0abiomass determination1 aMishoe, J.W.1 aReddy, P.R.0 tEcological modelling.g1984 Aug., v. 24, no. 1/2 p.61-77wJournal:jnl6191x0304-38007nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0304-3800(84)90055-3  a00000000b19850123c00000000  aENE  aNon-US 7aarticle02730naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127072000900145072000900154072000900163100001300172245008700185300001400272500011400286500002400400500001500424520104500439650002501484650003001509650003701539650001701576650002201593650002301615650001301638650002701651650001701678650002601695650002601721650002201747650002301769650001901792650001201811650002801823653002001851700001901871700001301890700002501903773010101928852000902029856006902038930003302107945002502140946001102165655001202176IND4380683420221118062513.0060606e200601  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438068342DNAL7 a10.1007/s11104-005-6333-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aJ200 0aF500 0aF6001 aNeto, D.10aHow do mycorrhizas affect C and N relationships in flooded Aster tripolium plants?  ap. 51-63.  aPaper presented at the X Iberian Symposium on Plant Mineral Nutrition, held September 2004, Lisbon, Portugal.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThe mycorrhizal associations established between plants and fungi have multiple effects on plant growth, directly affecting stress tolerance. This work aimed to explore arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) effects on carbon and nitrogen relationships of Aster tripolium L. and consequently on its flooding tolerance. Mycorrhizal and non-mycorrhizal juvenile plants were submitted to non-flooding and tidal flooding conditions for 56 d. Tidal flooding reduced biomass, but the presence of mycorrhiza had an ameliorating effect. The AM symbioses seem to have, like flooding, a stressful effect on A. tripolium at an early stage of plant development. However, once the plant was established, an improvement of growth performance of plants with mycorrhiza under flooding conditions was observed. The better tolerance of AM plants to flooding was mediated through an improvement of the osmotic adjustment of the plant tissues (higher concentrations of soluble sugars and proline) and through the increment of nitrogen acquisition in tidal-flooded plants. 3aTripolium pannonicum 3aassimilation (physiology) 3avesicular arbuscular mycorrhizae 3aplant stress 3amycorrhizal fungi 3asoil water content 3anitrogen 3amicrobial colonization 3awater stress 3aplant-water relations 3acarbon nitrogen ratio 3auptake mechanisms 3aflooded conditions 3aphotosynthesis 3abiomass 3asoil-plant interactions 0aAster tripolium1 aCarvalho, L.M.1 aCruz, C.1 aMartins-Loucao, M.A.0 tPlant and soil.g2006 Jan., v. 279, no. 1-2 p.51-63dKluwer Academic Publishersx0032-079X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11104-005-6333-y3electronic resource  a20061212b20070102c00000000  aINDdRSCe2006/07/12  aNon-US 7aarticle04044naa a2200721 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024003000133040001800163072000900181072000900190100001700199245008200216300001800298500002400316500001500340506007600355520177000431506003702201650002502238650001802263650001102281650001702292650002002309650003002329650002902359650002002388650001802408650001602426650001002442650001202452650001002464650001802474650001602492650005302508650003702561650003002598650002302628650003902651650001802690650003002708650002602738653002002764653002402784653001402808700002302822700001902845700002602864700002102890700001602911700002102927773013302948852000903081856008003090856006903170930003303239945002503272946001303297655001203310IND4380764520221207143852.0060607e200606  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438076452DNAL7 a167514982pmid7 aPMC14896472pmcid7 a10.1128/AEM.00963-052doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF831 0aF2001 aLysøe, Erik14aThe PKS4 Gene of Fusarium graminearum Is Essential for Zearalenone Production  ap. 3924-3932.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aZearalenones are produced by several Fusarium species and can cause reproductive problems in animals. Some aurofusarin mutants of Fusarium pseudograminearum produce elevated levels of zearalenone (ZON), one of the estrogenic mycotoxins comprising the zearalenones. An analysis of transcripts from polyketide synthase genes identified in the Fusarium graminearum database was carried out for these mutants. PKS4 was the only gene with an enoyl reductase domain that had a higher level of transcription in the aurofusarin mutants than in the wild type. An Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated transformation protocol was used to replace the central part of the PKS4 gene with a hygB resistance gene through double homologous recombination in an F. graminearum strain producing a high level of ZON. PCR and Southern analysis of transformants were used to identify isolates with single insertional replacements of PKS4. High-performance liquid chromatography analysis showed that the PKS4 replacement mutant did not produce ZON. Thus, PKS4 encodes an enzyme required for the production of ZON in F. graminearum. Barley root infection studies revealed no alteration in the pathogenicity of the PKS4 mutant compared to the pathogenicity of the wild type. The expression of PKS13, which is located in the same cluster as PKS4, decreased dramatically in the mutant, while transcription of PKS4 was unchanged. This differential expression may indicate that ZON or its derivatives do not regulate expression of PKS4 and that the PKS4-encoded protein or its product stimulates expression of PKS13. Furthermore, both the lack of aurofusarin and ZON influenced the expression of other polyketide synthases, demonstrating that one polyketide can influence the expression of others.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aFusarium graminearum 3amessenger RNA 3abarley 3abiosynthesis 3aHordeum vulgare 3afungal diseases of plants 3atranscription (genetics) 3agene expression 3apathogenicity 3azearalenone 3agenes 3amutants 3aroots 2aBase Sequence 2aDNA Primers 2aDNA, Fungalxgeneticsxisolation & purification. 2aFatty Acid Desaturasesxgenetics 2aFungal Proteinsxgenetics 2aFusariumxgenetics 2aGene Expression Regulation, Fungal 2aGenes, Fungal 2aPolymerase Chain Reaction 2aZearalenonexgenetics 0aGibberella zeae 0apolyketide synthase 0aPKS4 gene1 aKlemsdal, Sonja S.1 aBone, Karen R.1 aFrandsen, Rasmus J.N.1 aJohansen, Thomas1 aThrane, Ulf1 aGiese, Henriette0 tApplied and environmental microbiology.g2006 June, v. 72, no. 6 p.3924-3932dAmerican Society for Microbiologyx0099-22407nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1128/AEM.00963-053Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://aem.asm.org/contents-by-date.0.shtml3electronic resource  a20060720b20060804c00000000  aINDdRHFe2006/07/20  aOther US 7aarticle01974naa a2200313 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100001800115245003700133300002400170520110900194650001201303650001601315650001401331650001901345650002601364653002301390653002101413700001801434711006601452773006701518852000901585939003301594945000801627946001301635655001201648991630004410742620221118062704.0840917s1981    xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI840055342DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNichols, B.L.10aHuman milk: Nutritional resource  ap. 109-146. charts.  aThe nutrients which occur in human milk are individually discussed with reference to literature findings. The aspects of failure to thrive, and supplementation to enhance the viability of nutritional needs of infants on mother's milk, also are discussed. The human milk nutrients elaborated include: lipids, protein, carbohydrate, salt, minerals (calcium, phosphorus, iron, zinc, copper, manganese, iodine, fluoride), vitamins (D, K, A, E, C, thiamine, riboflavin, niacin, pantothenic acid, pyridoxine (B6), biotin, folate, cyanocobalamine (B12)), and water content. Maternal diet and nutritional status influence both the quantity and quality of human milk, with lactation also having a profound influence on maternal nutrient physiology. The nutritional needs of the lactating mother have been established, but, when related to caloric intake, the increased requirement is not uniform. The breastfeeding infant requires vitamin K supplementation in the newborn period, with vitamin D and fluoride, and iron supplementations suggested in the first and second breastfeeding semesters, respectively.

For this, the presence of VT1, VT2 and eaeA genes in 26 strains of E. coli O157:H7 and 6 strains of O157 was investigated by multiplex-PCR. The results have shown that eaeA gene was detected in all O157 and O157:H7 strains tested. Both VT2 and eaeA genes were detected in 4 (80%) of 5 strains of E. coli O157 and eaeA alone in 1 strain of O157. In 27 strains of O157:H7, 5 (18.5%) strains were found to be positive for VT1, VT2 and eaeA genes, 19 (70.3%) strains for both VT2 and eaeA and, 3 (11.1%) strains for only eaeA gene. Either VT1 alone or VT2 alone was not detected in any strains tested. eaeA gene alone in 2 strains, VT2-eaeA genes in 9 strains and VT1-VT2-eaeA genes in 2 strains were detected in 13 of E. coli O157:H7 strains isolated from cattle. eaeA alone in 1 strain, VT2-eaeA genes in 5 strains and VT1-VT2-eaeA genes in 2 strains were detected in 8 of E. coli O157:H7 strains isolated from carcasses. VT2-eaeA genes in 5 strains (isolated from hands, apron, knife and floor) and VT1-VT2-eaeA genes in 1 strain (isolated from knife) were also detected in 6 of E. coli O157:H7 strains isolated from environmental samples. This study reveals that most of the strains are found to be toxigenic and it is most likely that strains isolated from carcasses and abattoir environment originated from cattle feces. Therefore, HACCP systems are necessary from farm to table especially in the abattoirs to prevent contamination of meat and abattoir environment with intestinal content. 3aShiga-like toxins 3aslaughterhouses 3abeef carcasses 3abacterial contamination 3afood contamination 3apolymerase chain reaction 3abeef cattle 3afeces 3afood pathogens 3agenes 3agene frequency 3aEscherichia coli O157 3adetection 3avirulence 3aintimin 3aTurkey (country) 0aEscherichia coli O157:H7 0aisolation1 aGun, H.1 aUgur, M.1 aTuran, N.1 aYılmaz, H.0 tInternational journal of food microbiology.g2006 Feb. 1, v. 106, no. 2 p.213-217dElsevier Sciencex0168-16057nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijfoodmicro.2005.05.0183electronic resource  a20060713b20060804c00000000  aINDdPNNe2006/07/13  aNon-US 7aarticle03014naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004300092040001800135072000900153072000900162100001500171245015700186300001600343500002400359500001500383520126900398650002101667650001701688650003201705650002201737650002601759650001401785650002301799650001101822650002901833650002601862650001901888650002101907650001801928650001701946650001801963650002201981650001702003650001802020650001102038650002602049653002202075653002502097653002002122700001802142773012102160852000902281856007702290930003302367945002502400946001102425655001202436IND4380762420221118062515.0060607e20060201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438076242DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijfoodmicro.2005.06.0152doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ120 0aQ2001 aMasoud, W.14aThe effects of yeasts involved in the fermentation of Coffea arabica in East Africa on growth and ochratoxin A (OTA) production by Aspergillus ochraceus  ap. 229-234.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThe effects of Pichia anomala, Pichia kluyveri and Hanseniaspora uvarum predominant during coffee processing on growth of Aspergillus ochraceus and production of ochratoxin A (OTA) on malt extract agar (MEA) and on coffee agar (CA) were studied. The three yeasts were able to inhibit growth of A. ochraceus when co-cultured in MEA and CA. Growth inhibition was significantly higher on MEA than on CA. Furthermore, P. anomala and P. kluyveri were found to have a stronger effect on growth of A. ochraceus than H. uvarum. The three yeasts were able to prevent spore germination of A. ochraceus in yeast glucose peptone (MYGP) broth. In yeast-free supernatant of MYGP broth after an incubation period of 72 h, spores of A. ochraceus were able to germinate with very short germ tubes, but further development of the germ tubes was inhibited. The three yeasts decreased the pH of MYGP broth from 5.6 to a range of 4.4-4.7, which was found to have no effect on spore germination of A. ochraceus. P. anomala, P. kluyveri and H. uvarum were able to prevent production of OTA by A. ochraceus when co-cultured on MEA. On CA medium, P. anomala and P. kluyveri prevented A. ochraceus from producing OTA. H. uvarum did not affect production of OTA by A. ochraceus on CA medium. 3astarter cultures 3afermentation 3aCoffea arabica var. arabica 3atoxigenic strains 3aAspergillus alutaceus 3acoculture 3afood contamination 3ayeasts 3aWickerhamomyces anomalus 3asecondary metabolites 3afood pathogens 3amicrobial growth 3afungal spores 3acoffee beans 3amixed culture 3aspore germination 3aochratoxin A 3aculture media 3aPichia 3aantifungal properties 0aHansenula anomala 0aHanseniaspora uvarum 0aPichia kluyveri1 aKaltoft, C.H.0 tInternational journal of food microbiology.g2006 Feb. 1, v. 106, no. 2 p.229-234dElsevier Sciencex0168-16057nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijfoodmicro.2005.06.0153electronic resource  a20060713b20060804c00000000  aINDdPNNe2006/07/13  aNon-US 7aarticle03721naa a2200745 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111072001700129072001700146100001500163245009100178300001800269520130300287650002001590650001101610650001601621650001101637650001101648650001601659650001301675650001701688650001901705650002201724650001801746650003101764650002901795650003001824650002501854650002501879650003401904650002801938650005201966650004302018650008402061650002002145650004402165650002502209650003502234650003302269650002802302650008702330650001402417650004002431650006802471650003102539650002502570650004602595650003802641653002802679700001402707700001502721700001502736700001702751700001602768700001802784773008302802852000902885930003302894945002502927946001102952655001202963IND4364532020221118062413.0040917e200408  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436453202DNAL7 a153563292pmid  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aWatari, J.10aIdentification of sorbitol transporters expressed in the phloem of apple source leaves  ap. 1032-1041.  aSorbitol is a major photosynthetic product and a major phloem-translocated component in Rosaceae (e.g. apple, pear, peach, and cherry). We isolated the three cDNAs, MdSOT3, MdSOT4, and MdSOT5 from apple (Malus domestica) source leaves, which are homologous to plant polyol transporters. Yeasts transformed with the MdSOTs took up sorbitol significantly. MdSOT3- and MdSOT5-dependent sorbitol uptake was strongly inhibited by xylitol and myo-inositol, but not or only weakly by mannitol and dulcitol. Apparent K(m) values of MdSOT3 and MdSOT5 for sorbitol were estimated to be 0.71 mM and 3.2 mM, respectively. The protonophore, carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP), strongly inhibited the sorbitol transport. MdSOT3 was expressed specifically in source leaves, whereas MdSOT4 and MdSOT5 were expressed in source leaves and also in some sink organs. MdSOT4 and MdSOT5 expressions were highest in flowers. Fruits showed no or only weak MdSOT expression. Although MdSOT4 and MdSOT5 were also expressed in immature leaves, MdSOT expressions increased with leaf maturation. In addition, in situ hybridization revealed that all MdSOTs were expressed to high levels in phloem of minor veins in source leaves. These results suggest that these MdSOTs are involved in sorbitol loading in Rosaceae. 3aMalus domestica 3aapples 3afruit crops 3aleaves 3aphloem 3aplant veins 3asorbitol 3atransporters 3aplant proteins 3acomplementary DNA 3amessenger RNA 3agene expression regulation 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3asource-sink relationships 3aamino acid sequences 3anucleotide sequences 2aAmino Acid Sequencexgenetics 2aBase Sequencexgenetics 2aBinding, Competitivexdrug effectsxphysiology. 2aBiological Transport, Activexgenetics 2aCarbonyl Cyanide m-Chlorophenyl Hydrazonexanalogs & derivativesxpharmacology. 2aCells, Cultured 2aDNA, Complementaryxanalysisxgenetics. 2aEvolution, Molecular 2aFlowersxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aMalusxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aMonosaccharide Transport Proteinsxgeneticsxisolation & purificationxmetabolism. 2aPhylogeny 2aPlant Leavesxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aPlant Proteinsxgeneticsxisolation & purificationxmetabolism. 2aRNA, Messengerxmetabolism 2aSorbitolxmetabolism 2aSugar Alcoholsxmetabolismxpharmacology. 2aYeastsxdrug effectsxmetabolism. 0amolecular sequence data1 aKobae, Y.1 aYamaki, S.1 aYamada, K.1 aToyofuku, K.1 aTabuchi, T.1 aShiratake, K.0 tPlant & cell physiology.g2004 Aug., v. 45, no. 8 p.1032-1041x0032-07817nnas  aDNAL  a20040928b20041003c00000000  aINDdRSCe2004/09/28  aNon-US 7aarticle02830naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092040001800119072000900137100001400146245015000160300001800310500002400328500001500352520114500367650001701512650001701529650002301546650002801569650001501597650001301612650002201625650001501647650003601662650002801698650002101726650001401747650002301761653001501784653002301799653002701822653001501849700001401864700001501878700001501893700001601908700001801924700001501942773016201957852000902119856007702128930003302205945002502238946001302263655001202276IND4380700820221118062617.0060606e20060517xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438070082DNAL7 a10.1021/jf060299q2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF6001 aHudec, J.10aContent of phenolic compounds and free polyamines in black chokeberry (Aronia melanocarpa) after application of polyamine biosynthesis regulators  ap. 3625-3628.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThe total contents of anthocyanins, flavonoids, and phenolics in 60 samples of black chokeberries (Aronia melanocarpa), after treating with catabolites of polyamine biosynthesis (KPAb) and ornithine decarboxylase inhibitor, were analyzed spectrophotometrically, and quercetin and free polyamine contents were analyzed by RP-HPLC with UV detection. The average total contents of the individual substances and phenolic subgroups in control berries were as follows (mg.kg(-1)): anthocyanines, 6408; flavonoids, 664; phenolics, 37 600; quercetin, 349. KPAb decreased total contents of anthocyanines and phenolics only slightly but significantly increased the content of flavonoids. This caused an important change in the abundance of flavonoids in the pigment complex. The absolute content of quercetin was increased, but its ratio to flavonoids content was decreased. Ornithine decarboxylase inhibitor had a markedly different effect as it significantly increased total content of anthocyanins and total phenolics, inhibited the total content of free polyamines, and stimulated the processes of saccharides transformation to phenolic pigments. 3aanthocyanins 3asmall fruits 3aAronia melanocarpa 3aornithine decarboxylase 3aspermidine 3aspermine 3aenzyme inhibitors 3aputrescine 3achemical constituents of plants 3agamma-aminobutyric acid 3aplant physiology 3aquercetin 3aphenolic compounds 0apolyamines 0a1,3-propanediamine 0afruits (plant anatomy) 0aflavonoids1 aBakos, D.1 aMravec, D.1 aKobida, L.1 aBurdova, M.1 aTurianica, I.1 aHlusek, J.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2006 May 17, v. 54, no. 10 p.3625-3628dAmerican Chemical Society, Books and Journals Division]x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf060299q3Available from publisher's Web site  a20060804b20060906c00000000  aINDdRHFe2006/07/25  aOther US 7aarticle02418naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004300092040001800135072000900153072000900162100002100171245010300192300001600295500002400311500001500335520085700350650000901207650002001216650002801236650001801264650002301282650002701305650001801332650001001350650001301360650001801373650001901391650001601410650002801426650002401454650002001478653002701498700002301525700002001548700001901568700002401587773012201611852000901733856007701742930003301819945002501852946001101877655001201888IND4380705120221118062725.0060606e20051125xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438070512DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijfoodmicro.2005.04.0162doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL832 0aQ2021 aOliveira, C.J.B.10aPrevalence of pigs infected by Salmonella Typhimurium at slaughter after an enterocolitis outbreak  ap. 267-271.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aA cross-sectional study was performed to estimate the prevalence of slaughter pigs infected by Salmonella typhimurium after an enterocolitis outbreak in a commercial pig farm, which was characterised by diarrhoea during the growing phase. Anatomopathological and histopathological findings were suggestive of salmonellosis, which was further confirmed by isolation of S. typhimurium from organs and faeces samples from diseased animals. Ileocolic lymph nodes were aseptically collected from 43 pigs during slaughter procedures. The estimated prevalence of Salmonella-infected pigs was 53.48% [confidence interval (CI): 42.94:64.02%]. This finding demonstrates that the carriage of S. typhimurium at slaughter might be high if pigs originate from a batch previously affected by Salmonella-enterocolitis outbreak at the pre-harvest pork production chain. 3apork 3aslaughterhouses 3abacterial contamination 3aenterocolitis 3afood contamination 3aSalmonella Typhimurium 3apig carcasses 3aswine 3apandemic 3asalmonellosis 3afood pathogens 3alymph nodes 3across-sectional studies 3aon-farm food safety 3aanimal diseases 0aSalmonella typhimurium1 aCarvalho, L.F.O.S.1 aFernandes, S.A.1 aTavechio, A.T.1 aDomingues, F.J.

Thirty samples of sour cassava starch were collected from two factories in the state of Minas Gerais. The samples were examined for the presence of lactic acid bacteria, yeasts, mesophilic microorganisms, Bacillus cereus and faecal coliforms. Lactic acid bacteria and yeasts isolates were identified by biochemical tests, and the identities were confirmed by molecular methods. Lactobacillus plantarum and Lactobacillus fermentum were the prevalent lactic acid bacteria in product from both factories, at numbers between 6.0 and 9.0 log cfu g-1. Lactobacillus perolans and Lactobacillus brevis were minor fractions of the population. Galactomyces geothricum and Issatchenkia sp. were the prevalent yeasts at numbers of 5.0 log cfu g-1. A species similar to Candida ethanolica was frequently isolated from one factory. Mesophilic bacteria and amylolytic microorganisms were recovered in high numbers at all stages of the fermentation. B. cereus was found at low numbers in product at both factories. The spontaneous fermentations associated with the production of sour cassava starch involve a few species of lactic acid bacteria at high numbers and a variety of yeasts at relatively low numbers. 3astarter cultures 3acoliform bacteria 3afermentation 3afermented foods 3atapioca 3ayeasts 3alactic acid bacteria 3aplate count 3atraditional foods 3aBacillus cereus 3amolecular conformation 3achemotaxonomy 3aBrazil 0afood microbiology1 aMiranda, R.L.1 aBorelli, B.M.1 aNunes, A.C.1 aNardi, R.M.D.1 aLachance, M.A.1 aRosa, C.A.0 tInternational journal of food microbiology.g2005 Nov. 25, v. 105, no. 2 p.213-219dElsevier Sciencex0168-16057nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijfoodmicro.2005.04.0103electronic resource  a20060629b20060702c00000000  aINDdPNNe2006/06/29  aNon-US 7aarticle02084naa a2200313 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100002300115245003600138300002800174520118300202650001601385650002101401650001201422650002301434650002301457650002501480650003201505653002501537711006601562773006701628852000901695939003301704945000801737946001301745655001201758991629996640742620221118062651.0840914s1981    xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI840055312DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aForbes, Gilbert B.10aBody composition in adolescence  ap. 55-72. ill., charts.  aA brief introduction discusses currently used methods of assessing aspects of human body composition, and considers the implications for adolescent males and females. The methods discussed include: tissue density measurements; isotope dilution methodology using isotopes of hydrogen (e.g., labelled water), sodium, and potassium; the use of an isotope not bound by neutral fat (potassium-40); anthropometry; roentgenometry; and other techniques, such as urinary creatinine excretion. Topics of discussion include: data on lean body mass (LBM) growth; changes in body fat and calcium with subject age; the Frisch hypothesis (on menarche and body weight); pregnant adolescents; childhood obesity; the effects of vigorous training and exercise; and adolescent nutrient requirements. Lean weight, skeletal weight, and fat weight appear to possess independent individual growth curves.' Body fat is shown to be the source of most body weight variability between subjects, while the magnitude of LBM is important in assessing nutritional needs. The sex difference in LBM, the manifestation of which becomes clear at adolescence, is an important dimorphism at this stage in life.

  1 aMashiguchi, K.10aIsolation and identification of glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored arabinogalactan proteins and novelβ-glucosyl Yariv-reactive proteins from seeds of rice (Oryza sativa)  ap. 1817-1829.  a2019-12-05  aArabinogalactan proteins (AGPs) are highly glycosylated extracellular glycoproteins playing important roles in plant growth and development. We have previously reported the possibility that AGPs are involved in the induction of [alpha]-amylase by gibberellin (GA) in barley aleurone layers by using the [beta]-glucosyl Yariv reagent ([beta]-GlcY), which has been presumed to specifically bind AGPs. In this present study, we isolated [beta]-GlcY-reactive proteins from rice bran rich in aleurone cells. The N-terminal sequences of classical AGP and AG peptides were determined from hydrophilic fractions obtained by reversed phase HPLC. Interestingly, a novel non-specific lipid transfer protein-like protein (OsLTPL1) and a novel early nodulin-like protein (OsENODL1) were also identified in the more hydrophobic fractions from HPLC as [beta]-GlcY-reactive proteins. Expression analysis of the genes coding for these proteins was performed. While classical AGP, AG peptides and OsLTPL1 were expressed in various parts of rice, OsENODL1 showed temporally and spatially specific expression in the aleurone layers. This new [beta]-GlcY-reactive protein is a promising candidate for the extracellular signaling factors of GA action in cereal seeds. Furthermore, the possibility that proteins with the AG glycomodule might react with [beta]-GlcY may broaden the definition of AGPs. 3atransport proteins 3arice 3abarley 3aHordeum vulgare 3anodulins 3aOryza sativa 3arice bran 3afield crops 3atissue distribution 3aamino acid sequences 3agene expression 3aaleurone layer 3aphospholipase C 3aarabinogalactans 3aphosphatidylinositols 3aglycoproteins 3aseed development 0aYariv reagents 0aplant proteins 0anon-specific lipid transfer protein-like protein 0abeta-glucosyl yariv-reactive protein 0aphosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C 0aarabinogalactan proteins 0aglycosylphosphatidylinositol1 aYamaguchi, I.1 aSuzuki, Y.0 tPlant & cell physiology.g2004 Dec., v. 45, no. 12 p.1817-1829x0032-07817nnas  aDNAL  a20050912b00000000c00000000  aINDdRSCe2005/02/04  aNon-US 7aarticle03297naa a2200733 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111072001700129072001700146100001700163245007600180300001800256500001500274520098400289650000901273650001801282650002201300650002301322650001701345650002201362650003201384650001601416650002401432650002501456650002501481650003401506650002001540650003101560650003301591650001701624650001901641650002401660650003701684650001801721650004001739650004401779650004801823650002701871650002801898650003301926650003701959650003601996650006202032650004002094650006802134650003902202653001202241653003002253653002102283653002802304700001702332700001302349700001202362700001502374773008402389852000902473930003302482945002502515946001102540655001202551IND4366693420221118062832.0050118e200412  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436669342DNAL7 a156537952pmid  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aSugiyama, K.10aInteraction of N-acetylglutamate kinase with a PII-like protein in rice  ap. 1768-1778.  a2019-12-05  aPII protein in bacteria is a sensor for 2-oxoglutarate and a transmitter for glutamine signaling. We identified an OsGlnB gene that encoded a bacterial PII-like protein in rice. Yeast two-hybrid analysis showed that an OsGlnB gene product interacted with N-acetylglutamate kinase 1 (OsNAGK1) and PII-like protein (OsGlnB) itself in rice. In cyanobacteria, NAGK is a key enzyme in arginine biosynthesis. Transient expression of OsGlnB cDNA or OsNAGK1 cDNA fused with sGFP in rice leaf blades strongly suggested that the PII-like protein as well as OsNAGK1 protein is located in chloroplasts. Both OsGlnB and OsNAGK1 genes were expressed in roots, leaf blades, leaf sheaths and spikelets of rice, and these two genes were coordinately expressed in leaf blades during the life span. Thus, PII-like protein in rice plants is potentially able to interact with OsNAGK1 protein in vivo. This finding will provide a clue to the precise physiological function of PII-like protein in rice. 3arice 3amessenger RNA 3acomplementary DNA 3asequence alignment 3aOryza sativa 3atransgenic plants 3arecombinant fusion proteins 3afield crops 3atissue distribution 3aamino acid sequences 3anucleotide sequences 3aphosphotransferases (kinases) 3aprotein content 3agene expression regulation 3aprotein-protein interactions 3achloroplasts 3aplant proteins 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aArabidopsis Proteinsxmetabolism 2aBase Sequence 2aChloroplastsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aDNA, Complementaryxanalysisxgenetics. 2aGene Expression Regulation, Plantxgenetics 2aGlutamatesxmetabolism 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aOryzaxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aPII Nitrogen Regulatory Proteins 2aPhosphotransferasesxmetabolism 2aPhosphotransferases (Carboxyl Group Acceptor)xmetabolism 2aPlant Leavesxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aPlant Proteinsxgeneticsxisolation & purificationxmetabolism. 2aPlant Rootsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 0akinases 0aN-acetylgluttamate kinase 0aPII-like protein 0amolecular sequence data1 aHayakawa, T.1 aKudo, T.1 aIto, T.1 aYamaya, T.0 tPlant & cell physiology.g2004 Dec., v. 45, no. 12 p.1768-1778x0032-07817nnas  aDNAL  a20050912b00000000c00000000  aINDdRSCe2005/02/04  aNon-US 7aarticle03295naa a2200601 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127100001100144245017000155300001800325520151500343650002501858650002201883650001901905650002701924650002001951650001901971650002601990650003202016650002402048650003102072650001902103650001702122650001202139650001202151650001702163650002102180650001302201650001602214650002502230653001502255653002702270653005102297653002702348653002802375700001902403700001702422700001202439700001302451700002002464700001702484700001802501773008402519852000902603930003302612945002502645946001102670655001202681IND4366693620221118062702.0050118e200412  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436669362DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aLi, Y.10aOverexpression of phytochelatin synthase in Arabidopsis leads to enhanced arsenic tolerance and cadmium hypersensitivity. [Erratum: 2005 Feb., v. 46, no. 2, p. 387.]  ap. 1787-1797.  aPhytochelatin synthase (PCS) catalyzes the final step in the biosynthesis of phytochelatins, which are a family of cysteine-rich thiol-reactive peptides believed to play important roles in processing many thiol-reactive toxicants. A modified Arabidopsis thaliana PCS sequence (AtPCS1) was active in Escherichia coli. When AtPCS1 was overexpressed in Arabidopsis from a strong constitutive Arabidopsis actin regulatory sequence (A2), the A2::AtPCS1 plants were highly resistant to arsenic, accumulating 20-100 times more biomass on 250 and 300 [micro]M arsenate than wild type (WT); however, they were hypersensitive to Cd(II). After exposure to cadmium and arsenic, the overall accumulation of thiol-peptides increased to 10-fold higher levels in the A2::AtPCS1 plants compared with WT, as determined by fluorescent HPLC. Whereas cadmium induced greater increases in traditional PCs (PC₂, PC₃, PC₄), arsenic exposure resulted in the expression of many unknown thiol products. Unexpectedly, after arsenate or cadmium exposure, levels of the dipeptide substrate for PC synthesis, [gamma]-glutamyl cysteine ([gamma]-EC), were also dramatically increased. Despite these high thiol-peptide concentrations, there were no significant increases in concentrations of arsenic and cadmium in above-ground tissues in the AtPCS1 plants relative to WT plants. The potential for AtPCS1 overexpression to be useful in strategies for phytoremediating arsenic and to compound the negative effects of cadmium are discussed. 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3atransgenic plants 3aplant response 3aphysiological response 3ametal tolerance 3aplant proteins 3aaminoacyltransferases 3arecombinant fusion proteins 3agene overexpression 3agene expression regulation 3aphytochelatins 3abiosynthesis 3aarsenic 3acadmium 3aheavy metals 3aEscherichia coli 3acysteine 3aglutathione 3anucleotide sequences 0ametalloids 0aphytochelatin synthase 0aglutathione gamma-glutamylcysteinyltransferase 0agamma-glutamylcysteine 0amolecular sequence data1 aDhankher, O.P.1 aCarreira, L.1 aLee, D.1 aChen, A.1 aSchroeder, J.I.1 aBalish, R.S.1 aMeagher, R.B.0 tPlant & cell physiology.g2004 Dec., v. 45, no. 12 p.1787-1797x0032-07817nnas  aDNAL  a20050912b00000000c00000000  aINDdRSCe2005/02/04  aNon-US 7aarticle03290naa a2200613 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111072001700129072001700146100001800163245013500181300001800316520136800334650001701702650000901719650001601728650001401744650001301758650001901771650001101790650002801801650002001829650001501849650002601864650002501890650002401915650001801939650004401957650006802001650006002069650002802129650002302157650005202180650001902232650003402251650005602285650002102341651001002362651001002372653004402382653002802426700001702454700001502471700001602486773008402502852000902586930003302595945002502628946001102653655001202664IND4366694220221118062722.0050118e200412  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436669422DNAL7 a156538032pmid  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aTeranishi, M.10aUltraviolet-B sensitivities in Japanese lowland rice cultivars: cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer photolyase activity and gene mutation  ap. 1848-1856.  aThere is a cultivar difference in the response to ultraviolet-B (UVB: 280-320 nm) in rice (Oryza sativa L.). Among Japanese lowland rice cultivars, Sasanishiki, a leading Japanese rice cultivar, is resistant to the damaging effects of UVB while Norin 1, a close relative, is less resistant. We found previously that Norin 1 was deficient in cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer (CPD) photorepair ability and suggested that the UVB sensitivity in rice depends largely on CPD photorepair ability. In order to verify that suggestion, we examined the correlation between UVB sensitivity and CPD photolyase activity in 17 rice cultivars of progenitors and relatives in breeding of UV-resistant Sasanishiki and UV-sensitive Norin 1. The amino acid at position 126 of the deduced amino acid sequence of CPD photolyase in cultivars including such as Norin 1 was found to be arginine, the CPD photolyase activities of which were lower. The amino acid at that position in cultivars including such as Sasanishiki was glutamine. Furthermore, cultivars more resistant to UVB were found to exhibit higher photolyase activities than less resistant cultivars. These results emphasize that single amino acid alteration from glutamine to arginine leads to a deficit of CPD photolyase activity and that CPD photolyase activity is one of the main factors determining UVB sensitivity in rice. 3aOryza sativa 3arice 3afield crops 3acultivars 3alowlands 3aplant proteins 3alyases 3aamino acid substitution 3aenzyme activity 3aDNA repair 3aultraviolet radiation 3anucleotide sequences 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aBase Sequence 2aDNA, Complementaryxanalysisxgenetics. 2aGene Expression Regulation, Plantxgeneticsxradiation effects. 2aLyasesxgeneticsxisolation & purificationxmetabolism. 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aMutationxgenetics 2aOryzaxenzymologyxgeneticsxradiation effects. 2aPhotochemistry 2aPyrimidine Dimersxmetabolism 2aSeedlingsxenzymologyxgeneticsxradiation effects. 2aUltraviolet Rays 3aJapan 0aJapan 0acyclobutane pyrimidine dimer photolyase 0amolecular sequence data1 aIwamatsu, Y.1 aHidema, J.1 aKumagai, T.0 tPlant & cell physiology.g2004 Dec., v. 45, no. 12 p.1848-1856x0032-07817nnas  aDNAL  a20050912b00000000c00000000  aINDdRSCe2005/02/04  aNon-US 7aarticle03018naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111072001700129072001700146100001600163245014500179300001800324500001500342520130600357650001301663650001801676650001601694650000901710650002401719650001401743650001201757650002501769650000901794650002601803650002101829650006501850650002901915650003201944650003101976650004302007650005802050650001902108653001002127653002802137653002102165653001902186700001502205700001602220700002602236700001602262773008402278852000902362930003302371945002502404946001102429655001202440IND4366694020221118062831.0050118e200412  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436669402DNAL7 a156538012pmid  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Developing maize seeds synthesize and accumulate prolamin (zein) and 11S globulin (legumin-1) type proteins, which are sequestered in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) lumen and storage vacuoles, respectively. Immunofluorescence studies showed that the lumenal chaperone BiP was not randomly distributed within the ER in developing maize endosperm but concentrated within the zein-containing protein bodies. Analysis of the spatial distribution of RNAs in maize endosperm sections by in situ RT-PCR showed that, contrary to the conclusions made in an earlier study [Kim et al. (2002) Plant Cell 14: 655-672], the zein and legumin-1 RNAs are not symmetrically distributed on the ER but, instead, targeted to specific ER subdomains. RNAs coding for 22 kDa α-zein, 15 kDa β-zein, 27 kDa γ-zein and 10 kDa delta-zein were localized to ER-bounded zein protein bodies, whereas 51 kDa legumin-1 RNAs were distributed on adjacent cisternal ER proximal to the zein protein bodies. These results indicate that the maize storage protein RNAs are targeted to specific ER subdomains in developing maize endosperm and that RNA localization may be a prevalent mechanism to sort proteins within plant cells. 3aZea mays 3amessenger RNA 3agrain crops 3acorn 3atissue distribution 3aendosperm 3alegumin 3anucleotide sequences 3azein 3aendoplasmic reticulum 3aseed development 2aEndoplasmic Reticulumxgeneticsxmetabolismxultrastructure. 2aPlant Proteinsxgenetics 2aProtein Transportxgenetics 2aRNA, Messengerxmetabolism 2aSeedsxcytologyxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aZea maysxcytologyxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aZeinxgenetics 0aseeds 0amolecular sequence data 0astorage proteins 0aplant proteins1 aSugino, A.1 aMessing, J.1 aJesens, A.q(Andrejs)1 aOkita, T.W.0 tPlant & cell physiology.g2004 Dec., v. 45, no. 12 p.1830-1837x0032-07817nnas  aDNAL  a20060103b20060202c00000000  aINDdRSCe2005/02/04  aNon-US 7aarticle03218naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111072001700129072001700146100001700163245011100180300001800291520165700309650001701966650000901983650001601992650001902008650002402027650002202051650001802073650002002091650002202111650001402133650002102147650002502168650002402193650002102217650002502238650002802263650003302291650003402324653003102358653002102389653002802410700001702438700001402455700001802469700001502487773008402502852000902586930003302595945002502628946001102653655001202664IND4363404320221118062506.0040715e200311  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436340432DNAL7 a146341612pmid  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aMurakami, M.14aThe evolutionarily conserved OsPRR quintet: rice pseudo-response regulators implicated in circadian rhythm  ap. 1229-1236.  aIn Arabidopsis thaliana, a number of circadian-associated factors have been identified, including TOC1 (TIMING OF CAB EXPRESSION 1) that is believed to be a component of the central oscillator. TOC1 is a member of a small family of proteins, designated as ARABIDOPSIS PSEUDO-RESPONSE REGULATORS (APRR1/TOC1, APRR3, APRR5, APRR7, and APRR9). As demonstrated previously, these APRR1/TOC1 quintet members are crucial for a better understanding of the molecular links between circadian rhythms, control of flowering time through photoperiodic pathways, and also photosensory signal transduction in this dicotyledonous plant. In this respect, both the dicotyledonous (e.g. A. thaliana) and monocotyledonous (e.g. Oryza sativa) plants might share the evolutionarily conserved molecular mechanism underlying the circadian rhythm. Based on such an assumption, and as the main objective of this study, we asked the question of whether rice also has a set of pseudo-response regulators, and if so, whether or not they are associated with the circadian rhythm. Here we showed that rice has five members of the OsPRR family (Oryza sativa Pseudo-Response Regulator), and also that the expressions of these OsPRR genes are under the control of circadian rhythm. They are expressed in a diurnal and sequential manner in the order of OsPRR73 (OsPRR37) leads to OsPRR95 (OsPRR59) leads to OsPRR1, which is reminiscent of the circadian waves of the APRR1/TOC1 quintet in A. thaliana. These and other results of this study suggested that the OsPRR quintet, including the ortholog of APRR1/TOC1, might play important roles within, or close to, the circadian clock of rice. 3aOryza sativa 3arice 3agrain crops 3aplant proteins 3aconserved sequences 3acomplementary DNA 3amessenger RNA 3agene expression 3adiurnal variation 3aevolution 3acircadian rhythm 3aamino acid sequences 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aCircadian Rhythm 2aEvolution, Molecular 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aOryzaxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aSequence Homology, Amino Acid 0apseudo-response regulators 0abiological clock 0amolecular sequence data1 aAshikari, M.1 aMiura, K.1 aYamashino, T.1 aMizuno, T.0 tPlant & cell physiology.g2003 Nov., v. 44, no. 11 p.1229-1236x0032-07817nnas  aDNAL  a20050420b20050501c00000000  aINDdCMMe2005/03/10  aNon-US 7aarticle04113naa a2200685 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111072001700129100001500146245012800161300001800289500001500307520205800322650002202380650002302402650001202425650002002437650001502457650001402472650001902486650002502505650001502530650002302545650002302568650001002591650001102601650001502612650001902627650003902646650002402685650003102709650007702740650002502817650002802842650002102870650006902891650002302960650003402983653003603017653002203053653002803075653001103103653002903114700001503143700001703158700001503175700001303190700001703203700001703220700001603237773008403253852000903337930003303346945002503379946001103404655001203415IND4363413120221118062412.0040715e200310  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436341312DNAL7 a145816342pmid  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aYokota, E.10aPlant 115-kDa actin-filament bundling protein, P-115-ABP, is a homologue of plant villin and is widely distributed in cells  ap. 1088-1099.  a2019-12-05  aIn many cases, actin filaments are arranged into bundles and serve as tracks for cytoplasmic streaming in plant cells. We have isolated an actin-filament bundling protein, which is composed of 115-kDa polypeptide (P-115-ABP), from the germinating pollen of lily, Lilium longiflorum [Nakayasu et al. (1998) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 249: 61]. P-115-ABP shared similar antigenicity with a plant 135-kDa actin-filament bundling protein (P-135-ABP), a plant homologue of villin. A full-length cDNA clone (ABP115; accession no. AB097407) was isolated from an expression cDNA library of lily pollen by immuno-screening using antisera against P-115-ABP and P-135-ABP. The amino acid sequence of P-115-ABP deduced from this clone showed high homology with those of P-135-ABP and four villin isoforms of Arabidopsis thaliana (AtVLN1, AtVLN2, AtVLN3 and AtVLN4), especially AtVLN4, indicating that P-115-ABP can also be classified as a plant villin. The P-115-ABP isolated biochemically from the germinating lily pollen was able to arrange F-actin filaments with uniform polarity into bundles and this bundling activity was suppressed by Ca(2+)-calmodulin (CaM), similar to the actin-filament bundling properties of P-135-ABP. The P-115-ABP type of plant villin was widely distributed in plant cells, from algae to land plants. In root hair cells of Hydrocharis dubia, this type of plant villin was co-localized with actin-filament bundles in the transvacuolar strands and the subcortical regions. Microinjection of the antiserum against P-115-ABP into living root hair cells caused the disappearance of transvaculor strands and alteration of the route of cytoplasmic streaming. In internodal cells of Chara corallina in which the P-135-ABP type of plant villin is lacking, the P-115-ABP type showed co-localization with actin-filament cables anchored on the intracellular surface of chloroplasts. These results indicated that plant villins are widely distributed and involved in the organization of actin filaments into bundles throughout the plant kingdom. 3acomplementary DNA 3asequence alignment 3acalcium 3aChara corallina 3ainternodes 3aphylogeny 3amicrofilaments 3aamino acid sequences 3aroot hairs 3aLilium longiflorum 3apollen germination 3aactin 3apollen 3acalmodulin 3aplant proteins 2aActin Cytoskeletonxultrastructure 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aCarrier Proteinsxanalysis 2aMicrofilament Proteinsxanalysisxchemistryxmetabolismxultrastructure. 2aMicroscopy, Electron 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aMolecular Weight 2aPlant Proteinsxanalysisxchemistryxmetabolismxultrastructure. 2aSequence Alignment 2aSequence Homology, Amino Acid 0aactin-filament bundling protein 0aHydrocharis dubia 0amolecular sequence data 0avillin 0acalcium-binding proteins1 aVidali, L.1 aTominaga, M.1 aTahara, H.1 aOrii, H.1 aMorizane, Y.1 aHepler, P.K.1 aShimmen, T.0 tPlant & cell physiology.g2003 Oct., v. 44, no. 10 p.1088-1099x0032-07817nnas  aDNAL  a20050426b20050501c00000000  aINDdCMMe2005/03/22  aNon-US 7aarticle02076naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127072001700144100001800161245007100179300001800250500001500268520113200283650001001415650001301425650001201438650001901450650003001469653002301499700001501522700001501537773008401552852000901636930003301645945002501678946001101703655001201714IND4363413320221118062509.0040715e200310  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436341332DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aYoshimura, K.10aGravitaxis in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii studies with novel mutants  ap. 1112-1118.  a2019-12-05  aMany free-swimming unicellular organisms show negative gravitaxis, i.e. tend to swim upward, although their specific densities are higher than the medium density. To obtain clues to the mechanism of this behavior, we examined how a mutation in motility or behavior affects the gravitaxis in Chlamydomonas. A phototaxis mutant, ptx3, deficient in membrane excitability showed weakened gravitaxis, whereas another phototaxis mutant, ptx1, deficient in regulation of flagellar dominance displayed normal gravitaxis. Two mutants that swim backwards only, mbo1 and mbo2, did not show any clear gravitaxis. We also isolated two novel mutants deficient in gravitaxis, gtx1 and gtx2. These mutants displayed normal motility and physical characteristics of cell body as assessed by the behavior of anesthetized cells. However, these cells were found to have defects in physiological responses involving membrane excitation. These observations are consistent with the idea that the gravitaxis in Chlamydomonas involves a physiological signal transduction system, which is at least partially independent of the system used for phototaxis. 3aalgae 3ageotaxis 3amutants 3aplant response 3aChlamydomonas reinhardtii 0aalgae and seaweeds1 aMatsuo, Y.1 aKamiya, R.0 tPlant & cell physiology.g2003 Oct., v. 44, no. 10 p.1112-1118x0032-07817nnas  aDNAL  a20050426b20050501c00000000  aINDdCMMe2005/03/22  aNon-US 7aarticle02965naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127100001500144245020800159300001600367500001500383520141500398650002201813650003401835650001701869650001701886650002501903650002201928650002501950650003301975650002202008650002002030650002002050650001902070650002502089650002002114650001902134650001702153653002002170653002802190700001802218700001602236700001802252700001802270773008102288852000902369930003302378945002502411946001102436655001202447IND4363646520221118062357.0040731e200306  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436364652DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aSlesak, I.10aRedox changes in the chloroplast and hydrogen peroxide are essential for regulation of C₃-CAM transition and photooxidative stress responses in the facultative CAM plant Mesembryanthemum crystallinum L  ap. 573-581.  a2019-12-05  aMesembryanthemum crystallinum, a facultative halophyte and C3-Crassulacean acid metabolism (CAM) intermediate plant, has become a favoured plant for studying stress response mechanisms during C3-CAM shifts. One hour of exposure to excess light (EL) caused inhibition of photosynthetic electron transport in M. crystallinum leaves as indicated by chlorophyll a fluorescence measurements. This was accompanied by an increase in NADP-malic enzyme (ME), one of the key cytosolic enzymes involved in CAM, and by a general increase in superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity. In contrast, NAD-ME activity (the mitochondrial form of ME) was not affected by EL. Exposure to EL and 2,5-dibromo-3-methyl-6-isopropyl-p-benzoquinone (DBMIB) treatment of a whole plant in low light induced hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and C3 to CAM transition. In contrast, treatment with 3-3,4-dichlorophenyl-1,1-dimethyl urea (DCMU) has blocked high light-induced H2O2 accumulation and C3-CAM transition. Moreover, the abundance of transcripts encoding different SODs, ascorbate peroxidase and SOD activity was differently regulated by DCMU and DBMIB. Results of applying EL or high light, H2O2 and photosynthetic electron transport inhibitors suggest that the redox events in the vicinity of PSII and/or PSI and photo-produced H2O2 play a major role in the regulation of C3-CAM transition and photooxidative stress responses in M. crystallinum. 3aC3 photosynthesis 3aMesembryanthemum crystallinum 3amalic enzyme 3aplant stress 3aascorbate peroxidase 3ahydrogen peroxide 3asuperoxide dismutase 3aCrassulacean acid metabolism 3aelectron transfer 3alight intensity 3agene expression 3aplant response 3anucleotide sequences 3aenzyme activity 3aphotooxidation 3achloroplasts 0aredox reactions 0amolecular sequence data1 aKarpinska, B.1 aSurowka, E.1 aMiszalski, Z.1 aKarpinski, S.0 tPlant & cell physiology.g2003 June, v. 44, no. 6 p.573-581x0032-07817nnas  aDNAL  a20050325b20050401c00000000  aINDdCMMe2005/03/24  aNon-US 7aarticle03481naa a2200745 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111072001700129072001700146072001700163072001700180100001400197245007800211300001600289500001500305520106700320650002501387650001701412650001801429650001401447650001601461650001501477650002001492650001701512650002401529650002301553650001201576650001901588650002501607650001601632650003101648650002101679650002301700650004901723650006801772650002501840650005401865650006801919650005601987650001002043650003902053650004302092650002302135650009402158650003502252650004602287650001802333650001902351650004502370650005402415653003302469653001902502700001502521700001402536700001402550773008102564852000902645930003302654945002502687946001102712655001202723IND4363646420221118062401.0040731e200306  xx |||||o|||||||||||ind||7 aIND436364642DNAL7 a128266212pmid  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Plants with the fin5-1 mutation exhibited a long hypocotyl phenotype when grown under far-red (FR) light, but not under red light. Physiological analyses implied that FIN5 might be differentially involved in diverse responses that are regulated by phyA under continuous FR light. Anthocyanin accumulation, gravitropic response of hypocotyl growth, and FR light-pre-conditioned blocking of greening were also impaired in the fin5-1 mutant, whereas photoperiodic floral induction was not, if at all, significantly affected. Moreover, light-regulated expression of the CHS, PORA and PsbS genes was attenuated in fin5-1 mutant plants, while the light-induced expression of CAB was normal. The mutation exhibited semi-dominance regarding control of hypocotyl growth in FR light. We suggest that FIN5 defines a novel branch in the network of phyA signaling in Arabidopsis. 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3aanthocyanins 3afar-red light 3aflowering 3aapoproteins 3ahypocotyls 3abioaccumulation 3agravitropism 3asignal transduction 3achromosome mapping 3amutants 3aplant response 3aphenotypic variation 3aphytochrome 3agene expression regulation 2aAcyltransferases 2aAdaptation, Ocular 2aAnthocyaninsxmetabolismxradiation effects. 2aArabidopsisxgeneticsxgrowth & developmentxradiation effects. 2aArabidopsis Proteins 2aFlowersxgrowth & developmentxradiation effects. 2aGene Expression Regulation, Plantxgeneticsxradiation effects. 2aHypocotylxgrowth & developmentxradiation effects. 2aLight 2aLight-Harvesting Protein Complexes 2aMutationxgeneticsxradiation effects. 2aPhotic Stimulation 2aPhotosynthetic Reaction Center Complex Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolismxradiation effects. 2aPhotosystem II Protein Complex 2aPhytochromexgeneticsxradiation effects. 2aPhytochrome A 2aPlant Proteins 2aProteinsxmetabolismxradiation effects. 2aSignal Transductionxgeneticsxradiation effects. 0afar-red insensitive 5-1 gene 0aplant proteins1 aHong, S.H.1 aNam, H.G.1 aSoh, M.S.0 tPlant & cell physiology.g2003 June, v. 44, no. 6 p.565-572x0032-07817nnas  aDNAL  a20050325b20050401c00000000  aINDdCMMe2005/03/24  aNon-US 7aarticle03832naa a2200721 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111072001700129072001700146100001300163245011700176300001600293500001500309520141400324650002801738650001901766650001201785650002001797650002801817650002801845650005201873650002001925650002001945650002801965650001901993650003802012650002102050650001002071650002102081650001902102650002802121650003502149650004402184650005402228650004802282650001802330650002002348650004402368650003502412650003502447650005702482650002802539650004002567650006102607650006202668650003102730650002502761650002402786650002802810653003402838653002802872653002502900700001402925773008102939852000903020930003303029945002503062946001103087655001203098IND4363647120221118062549.0040731e200306  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436364712DNAL7 a128266282pmid  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aLi, X.Q.10aGene expression activity and pathway selection for sucrose metabolism in developing storage root of sweet potato  ap. 630-636.  a2019-12-05  aDevelopment of sweet potato (Ipomoea batatas) storage root coincides with starch accumulation made using cleaved products of imported photoassimilate sucrose. The genes and pathways are predominantly active for sucrose metabolism in developing storage root were unknown. In this study, we used both an expressed sequence tag (EST) approach and a reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) approach to answer this question. Sucrose synthase (SuSy) was found to be significantly more frequent in storage root ESTs than in fibrous root ESTs. SuSy was the most abundant carbohydrate-metabolism gene in the storage-root ESTs. RT-PCR results confirmed this by showing that invertase was active in fibrous roots but rapidly decreased to an undetectable level during storage root development while SuSy became predominant. Invertase expression was also detectable in young immature storage root and shoot tips, suggesting an involvement in cell formation. SuSy expression pattern showed considerable similarity to that of ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase, an essential enzyme for starch synthesis. The results indicated that (i) SuSy was the most actively expressed enzyme in sucrose metabolism in developing storage root and was correlated with sink strength, and (ii) whereas invertase was active at cell formation stages, SuSy pathway was predominant for sucrose cleavage related to starch-accumulation. 3acarbohydrate metabolism 3asweet potatoes 3asucrose 3avegetable crops 3aexpressed sequence tags 3adry matter accumulation 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3aIpomoea batatas 3agene expression 3abeta-fructofuranosidase 3astorage organs 3aadenine phosphoribosyltransferase 3aplant morphology 3aroots 3asucrose synthase 3aplant proteins 2aBase Sequencexgenetics 2aCell Differentiationxgenetics 2aDNA, Complementaryxanalysisxgenetics. 2aGene Expression Regulation, Enzymologicxgenetics 2aGene Expression Regulation, Plantxgenetics 2aGenome, Plant 2aGenomic Library 2aGlucose-1-Phosphate Adenylyltransferase 2aGlucosyltransferasesxgenetics 2aGlycoside Hydrolasesxgenetics 2aIpomoeaxgeneticsxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aNucleotidyltransferasesxmetabolism 2aPlant Rootsxgeneticsxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aPlant Shootsxgeneticsxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aRNA, Messengerxmetabolism 2aStarchxbiosynthesis 2aSucrosexmetabolism 2abeta-Fructofuranosidase 0aADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase 0amolecular sequence data 0anucleotide sequences1 aZhang, D.0 tPlant & cell physiology.g2003 June, v. 44, no. 6 p.630-636x0032-07817nnas  aDNAL  a20050330b20050401c00000000  aINDdCMMe2005/03/25  aNon-US 7aarticle00842naa a2200265 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100001500115245001700130300001400147520019500161650000900356650001300365650001200378650001900390653001900409773007300428852000900501939003300510945000800543946001300551655001200564991629985380742620221118062601.0890714e198708  xx ||||go|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI890011742DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEberly, N.14aThe new wave  ap. 40-42.  aThis article discusses the health benefits of fish and seafood in the diabetic diet.

  1 aChoi, D.10aWhole genome analysis of the OsGRF gene family encoding plant-specific putative transcription activators in rice (Oryza sativa L.)  ap. 897-904.  a2019-12-05  aOsGRF1 (Oryza sativa GROWTH-REGULATING FACTOR1) is a rice gene encoding a putative novel transcriptional regulator. We identified and characterized eleven homologs of OsGRF1 in the rice genome. All twelve OsGRF proteins have two highly conserved regions, the QLQ (Gln, Leu, Gln) and WRC (Trp, Arg, Cys) domains, and sequences reminiscent of transcription factors. OsGRF genes were preferentially expressed in young and growing tissues, and applied gibberellic acid (GA3) enhanced the expression of seven OsGRF genes. In situ hybridization showed high levels of OsGRF1 transcripts in the shoot apical meristem and in cells surrounding the vasculature of the intercalary meristem. In a GAL4-based yeast assay, the C-terminal region of OsGRF1 was found to have transactivation activity. These results indicate that OsGRF1 acts as a transcriptional activator. Based on the in situ expression pattern of OsGRF1, we postulate that it may be involved in regulating vegetative growth in rice. 3atranscription factors 3asequence analysis 3arice 3amessenger RNA 3agrain crops 3atranscriptional activation 3aOryza sativa 3agenome 3agibberellic acid 3aconserved sequences 3aamino acid sequences 3agenomics 3anucleotide sequences 3aplant proteins 2aDNA, Complementaryxanalysisxgenetics. 2aEvolution, Molecular 2aGene Expression Regulation, Plantxgenetics 2aGenome, Plant 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aMultigene Familyxgenetics 2aOryzaxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aPhylogeny 2aPlant Growth Regulatorsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aPlant Proteinsxgeneticsxisolation & purificationxmetabolism. 2aProtein Structure, Tertiaryxgenetics 2aRNA, Messengerxmetabolism 2aSequence Homology, Amino Acid 2aSequence Homology, Nucleic Acid 2aTrans-Activatorsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aTranscriptional Activationxgenetics 0agrowth-regulating factor1 gene 0amolecular sequence data 0agibberellins 0agene expression regulation1 aKim, J.H.1 aKende, H.0 tPlant & cell physiology.g2004 July, v. 45, no. 7 p.897-904x0032-07817nnas  aDNAL  a20040830b20040901c00000000  aINDdRSCe2004/08/28  aNon-US 7aarticle03666naa a2200673 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111072001700129072001700146100001700163245015300180300001600333500001500349520146600364650000901830650002701839650001601866650001701882650001401899650002901913650002501942650003101967650001701998650001902015650003502034650002702069650004302096650003002139650004802169650003102217650006202248650002802310650002302338650005302361650002902414650004402443650003602487650003502523650006102558650004902619653002802668653001302696653002102709700001502730700001502745700001502760700001802775700001602793700001202809773008102821852000902902930003302911945002502944946001102969655001202980IND4364531420221118062738.0040917e200408  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436453142DNAL7 a153563242pmid  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aSugimoto, H.14aThe virescent-2 mutation inhibits translation of plastid transcripts for the plastid genetic system at an early stage of chloroplast differentiation  ap. 985-996.  a2019-12-05  aThe rice virescent-2 mutant (v2) is temperature conditional and develops chlorotic, chloroplast-deficient leaves at the restrictive temperature. In the v2 mutant, plastid-encoded proteins involved in photosynthesis and plastid transcriptional regulation were not detectable at any time during chloroplast differentiation. However, the plastid transcripts for these two classes of proteins behaved differently in the mutant, with those for the plastid transcription/translation apparatus accumulating to wild-type levels and those for photosynthetic apparatus being suppressed. Polysome analysis showed that translation of the plastid transcripts encoding the plastid transcription/translation apparatus was blocked at an early stage of chloroplast differentiation. Accumulation of transcripts of nuclear-encoded photosynthetic genes, such as cab and rbcS, was strongly suppressed in the mutant at later stages of chloroplast differentiation, whereas transcripts of genes for the plastid transcription apparatus, such as OsRpoTp and OsSIG2A, accumulated to abnormally high levels at these stages. These results suggest that activation of the plastid translation machinery at an early stage of chloroplast differentiation is important for triggering the transmission of information about plastid developmental state to the nucleus, which in turn is required for the induction of nuclear-encoded chloroplast proteins at later stages of chloroplast differentiation. 3arice 3atranslation (genetics) 3agrain crops 3aOryza sativa 3aribosomes 3atranscription (genetics) 3anucleotide sequences 3agene expression regulation 3achloroplasts 3aplant proteins 2aCell Differentiationxgenetics 2aCell Nucleusxgenetics 2aDNA-Directed RNA Polymerasesxgenetics 2aDown-Regulationxgenetics 2aGene Expression Regulation, Plantxgenetics 2aGenes, Regulatorxgenetics 2aLight-Harvesting Protein Complexesxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aMutationxgenetics 2aOryzaxcytologyxgeneticsxgrowth & development. 2aPhotosynthesisxgenetics 2aPlant Proteinsxbiosynthesisxgenetics. 2aPlastidsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aProtein Biosynthesisxgenetics 2aRibulose-Bisphosphate Carboxylasexgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aSilencer Elements, Transcriptionalxgenetics 0amolecular sequence data 0aplastids 0avirescent-2 gene1 aKusumi, K.1 aTozawa, Y.1 aYazaki, J.1 aKishimoto, N.1 aKikuchi, S.1 aIba, K.0 tPlant & cell physiology.g2004 Aug., v. 45, no. 8 p.985-996x0032-07817nnas  aDNAL  a20040927b20041003c00000000  aINDdRSCe2004/09/27  aNon-US 7aarticle03075naa a2200601 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111072001700129072001700146072001700163100001400180245011000194300001600304500001500320520127900335650002501614650001701639650002101656650001301677650002501690650002201715650002501737650001101762650001201773650002501785650002001810650002101830650002101851650002101872650003901893650003501932650003501967650005402002650004802056650002302104650003102127650005002158653001502208653002002223653001702243700001402260700001402274700001402288773008102302852000902383930003302392945002502425946001102450655001202461IND4363982220221118062931.0040818e200407  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436398222DNAL7 a152950762pmid  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Genetic studies of these organisms have revealed that extended longevity is frequently associated with an increased resistance to stress. However, the relationship between life span and oxidative stress tolerance in plants is poorly understood. We have investigated the responses to oxidative stress in the delayed leaf senescence mutants of Arabidopsis thaliana, ore1, ore3, and ore9. The detached leaves of these mutants exhibit increased tolerance to various types of oxidative stress. The ore1, ore3, and ore9 mutants were also more tolerant to oxidative stress at the level of the whole plant, as determined by measuring physiological and molecular changes associated with oxidative stress. However, the activities of antioxidant enzymes were similar or lower in the mutants, as compared to wild type. These results suggest that the increased resistance to oxidative stress in the ore1, ore3, and ore9 mutants is not due to enhanced activities of these antioxidant enzymes. Taken together, our findings provide genetic evidence that oxidative stress tolerance is linked to control of leaf longevity in plants. 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3aplant stress 3aoxidative stress 3acatalase 3aascorbate peroxidase 3ahydrogen peroxide 3asuperoxide dismutase 3aleaves 3amutants 3aphenotypic variation 3aenzyme activity 3aplant morphology 3aleaf development 3astress tolerance 2aArabidopsisxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aCellular Senescencexgenetics. 2aEnzymesxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aGene Expression Regulation, Enzymologicxgenetics 2aGene Expression Regulation, Plantxgenetics 2aMutationxgenetics 2aOxidative Stressxgenetics 2aPlant Leavesxcytologyxgeneticsxmetabolism. 0asenescence 0amethyl viologen 0aantioxidants1 aKim, J.H.1 aNam, H.G.1 aLim, P.O.0 tPlant & cell physiology.g2004 July, v. 45, no. 7 p.923-932x0032-07817nnas  aDNAL  a20040830b20040901c00000000  aINDdRSCe2004/08/28  aNon-US 7aarticle03371naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002800092040001800120072001700138072001700155072001700172100001400189245014300203300001600346500002300362500001500385520190700400650002002307650001302327650001802340650002402358650002202382650002302404650001802427650002502445650001702470651003002487653001402517653003302531653001302564700001702577700001302594700001502607700001502622773007202637852000902709856007802718930003302796945002502829946001102854655001202865IND4394180220221118063124.0070816e200703  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439418022DNAL7 a10.5558/tfc83207-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aTobin, A.10aForestry Water Quality Index - A planning tool for the assessment and communication of the impacts of forestry activities on water quality  ap. 207-214.  aSummary in French.  a2019-12-04  aThe assessment of the impacts of forestry activities on water quality is a critical component of forestry management and planning, especially when watersheds are being used for different water uses by different stakeholders. Traditional methodologies for assessing these impacts, while accurate, often do not take into account the intended use of water.Water quality data are inherently technical and are not conducive to communication to all stakeholders--especially the public. There is a need for a communications-based assessment tool that assesses the impact of forestry activities on water quality from the perspective of different water uses. This paper describes the development and application of such a tool, the Forestry Water Quality Index (FWQI). The FWQI has been developed specifically to capture, evaluate and communicate the impact of forestry activities on water quality to multiple stakeholders. Initially based on the Canadian Council of Ministers of the Environment's Water Quality Index, the FWQI was specifically adapted for applications in forestry management. Details of this adaptation and its methodology are outlined. Case studies from Newfoundland and Labrador illustrate the use of the FWQI for communication, performance evaluation, and planning and technical data analysis. The FWQI tool has the ability to compare pre- and post-forestry water quality data (communication), determine the effectiveness of best management practices (performance evaluation), predict water quality after forestry activities (planning) and evaluate seasonal variations in water quality (data analysis). These components provide useful information for the evaluation of the effects of forestry activities on water quality and to ensure sustainable forest management. It can be utilized by both forestry and water resources management to ensure sustainable development of the forestry sector. 3awater pollution 3aplanning 3awater quality 3aforested watersheds 3aforest management 3aseasonal variation 3adata analysis 3aenvironmental impact 3acase studies 3aNewfoundland and Labrador 0awater use 0aForestry Water Quality Index 0aforestry1 aAli Khan, A.1 aKhan, H.1 aMoores, L.1 aTaylor, J.0 tForestry chronicle.g2007 , v. 83, no. 2 p.207-214x0015-75467nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.5558/tfc83207-23Available from publisher's Web site  a20071205b20080102c00000000  aINDd2CTe2007/11/16  aNon-US 7aarticle03221naa a2200541 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024001800097040001800115100002300133245011900156300001600275520164200291650003101933650001601964650001801980650002001998650001402018650001002032650000902042650001002051650000902061650003802070650004602108650001902154650003402173650001802207650003302225650003302258650001102291650001102302650001402313650001602327650002602343650001802369650002402387650001702411650002902428653002302457700002202480773010202502852000902604939003302613945000802646946001302654655001202667991629972040742620221118061705.0930825e199308  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI930024382DNAL7 a84091012pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBarrett-Connor, E.10aDietary fat, calories, and the risk of breast cancer in postmenopausal women: a prospective population-based study  ap. 390-399.  aWe tested the hypothesis that a high-fat diet increases the risk of breast cancer in a population-based study of 590 women aged 40-79 years who were without known breast cancer when they provided a quantitative 24-hour diet recall. Fifteen postmenopausal women were diagnosed with incident breast cancer during the next 15 years (approximately 7600 person-years of follow-up). These women had significantly higher age-adjusted intake of afl fats (monounsaturated, polyunsaturated, and saturated), and oleic, linoleic, and linolenic acids, with a stepwise increase in risk across tertiles of intake. Fat intake was associated with total calories, protein, and carbohydrates, and women with incident breast cancer consumed more calories, protein, and carbohydrates than did other subjects. When each nutrient variable (calories, fats, protein, and carbohydrates) was adjusted for age, body mass index, age at menopause, parity, and alcohol consumption, the strongest risks for incident breast cancer were associated with total calories (relative risk per standard deviation = 2.72, 95% confidence interval = 1.51-4.89, p = 0.002) and total fats (relative risk per standard deviation = 2.01, 95% confidence interval = 1.19-3.41, p = 0.0 1). Fat composition of the diet, expressed either as percent of energy or as fat intake adjusted for calories by regression analysis, was not significantly associated with risk of breast cancer. These results support the hypothesis that total calorie consumption, as well as dietary fat consumption, is a risk factor for breast cancer in postmenopausal women, and parallel observations in animal models. 3amammary neoplasms (animal) 3adietary fat 3aenergy intake 3anutrient intake 3amenopause 3awomen 3arisk 2aAdult 2aAged 2aAlcohol Drinkingxadverse effects 2aBreast Neoplasmsxepidemiologyxetiology. 2aCohort Studies 2aDietary Fatsxadverse effects 2aEnergy Intake 2aEstrogen Replacement Therapy 2aFatty Acidsxadverse effects 2aFemale 2aHumans 2aIncidence 2aMiddle Aged 2aMultivariate Analysis 2aPostmenopause 2aProspective Studies 2aRisk Factors 2aSmokingxadverse effects 0aliterature reviews1 aFriedlander, N.J.0 tJournal of the American College of Nutrition.g1993 Aug., v. 12, no. 4 p.390-399x0731-57247nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aFNC  aOther US 7aarticle02697naa a2200577 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024001800097040001800115100001900133245006300152300001600215500001500231520114000246650000901386650002801395650001001423650001701433650001901450650001801469650001601487650001201503650001701515650002001532650001901552650002301571650001901594650001001613650002801623650001901651650002101670650002201691650002001713650003801733650002801771650002801799650001101827650001101838650001601849650002101865650001701886650002301903653001601926773010201942852000902044939003302053945000802086946001302094655001202107991629971890742620221118061616.0930825e199308  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI930024342DNAL7 a84090952pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGarrison, R.J.10aHealthy adiposity in women: the Framingham Offspring Study  ap. 357-362.  a2019-12-04  aThis report estimates a threshold for 'healthy adiposity' by determining the relationship between subscapular skinfolds thickness, a direct measure of adiposity, and cardiovascular disease risk factors in 1254 nonsmoking adult women who participated in the Framingham Offspring Study. Cardiovascular disease risk factors, including blood pressure, fasting plasma lipoprotein cholesterol, plasma glucose and echocardiographically measured left ventricular mass, were included. The optimal subscapular skinfold for 20-39-year-old women was determined to be < 15 mm. Women aged 20-59 whose subscapular skinfolds were below this level had a mean body mass index (BMI) of 21.1 kg/M2. Weight-for-height estimates for these women corresponded closely to the 1959 Metropolitan Life Insurance Company Desirable Weight table. The probability of having unhealthy adiposity was estimated for all women aged 20-59 for each (rounded) integer value grouping of BMI. The probability of being above the healthy adiposity threshold rises rapidly across BMI levels >20 and plateaus >24. Thus, only women with BMI <24 need assessment for adiposity status. 3arisk 3acardiovascular diseases 3awomen 3alipoproteins 3aadipose tissue 3ablood glucose 3acholesterol 3aobesity 3ablood plasma 3abody mass index 3ablood pressure 3askinfold thickness 2aAdipose Tissue 2aAdult 2aBlood Glucosexanalysis 2aBlood Pressure 2aBody Composition 2aBody Constitution 2aBody Mass Index 2aCardiovascular Diseasesxetiology 2aCholesterol, HDLxblood 2aCholesterol, LDLxblood 2aFemale 2aHumans 2aMiddle Aged 2aReference Values 2aRisk Factors 2aSkinfold Thickness 0abody weight0 tJournal of the American College of Nutrition.g1993 Aug., v. 12, no. 4 p.357-362x0731-57247nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aFNC  aOther US 7aarticle02962naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002800092040001800120100001500138245009200153300001600245500002300261520154400284650002001828650001801848650001201866650001101878650002001889650001101909650002601920650002101946650002301967650001801990650001302008650002302021651001002044651001802054651001602072651002502088653001602113653001602129653001202145653001402157653001702171700002502188773008702213852000902300856007802309930003302387945001302420946001102433655001202444IND2049323520221118061849.0951226e199509  onc|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204932352DNAL7 a10.5558/tfc71639-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChui, Y.H.10aWood properties of exotic larch grown in eastern Canada and north-eastern United States  ap. 639-646.  aSummary in French.  aThe rapid growth performance of exotic larch such as Japanese larch (Larix leptolepis (Sieb. et Zucc) Gord.) and European larch (Larix decidua Mill.) has attracted the attention of the forestry sector in eastern Canada and north-eastern United States for lumber and pulp production. While growth performance of these species in North America has been well documented, little is known with regards to their wood properties. The objective of this study was to evaluate the primary lumber grade yields, mechanical properties, fiber length, specific gravity and cold-water soluble extractives of larch from plantations in Maine, Nova Scotia, New Brunswick and Prince Edward Island. Samples were obtained from a Japanese (age 31), three European (age 17, 34 and 63) and one Japanese X European hybrid (age 22-27) larch stands. It was found that the structural grade yields of these species were relatively low because of the influence of knots. The mechanical properties (modulus of rupture and modulus of elasticity) of the mature European larch appeared to be comparable with published data for some native softwood species. Fiber length, specific gravity and cold-water soluble extractive content of all samples were similar to those found for other softwood species which are used for pulp production. Fiber length of the juvenile wood of European larch was significantly shorter than that of mature wood. Extractive content was highest in newly formed heartwood. Contrary to common belief, extractive content in young trees may not be low. 3aLarix kaempferi 3aLarix decidua 3ahybrids 3alumber 3awood properties 3ayields 3amodulus of elasticity 3aspecific gravity 3aforest plantations 3ajuvenile wood 3atree age 3amodulus of rupture 3aMaine 3aNew Brunswick 3aNova Scotia 3aPrince Edward Island 0acomparisons 0aextractives 0abending 0alog grade 0afiber length1 aMacKinnon-Peters, G.0 tForestry chronicle.g1995 , v. 71, no. 5 p.639-646wJournal:12176x0015-75467nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.5558/tfc71639-53Available from publisher's Web site  a19960202b19960208c00000000  aINDdNZM  aNon-US 7aarticle02021naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002800092040001800120100001900138245013500157300001600292500002300308520088300331650001301214650002401227650001701251650001201268651001101280653003001291653001101321653002301332653001201355653002401367700001301391773008701404852000901491856007801500930003301578945001301611946001101624655001201635IND2049636420221118061735.0960129e199403  onc|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204963642DNAL7 a10.5558/tfc70148-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBrassard, G.R.10aMeasuring the quantity and quality of Canadian forestry research through a survey of publications in Forestry Abstracts, 1978-1992  ap. 148-150.  aSummary in French.  aConcerns have recently been expressed that Canada's forestry research effort may have declined in terms of quantity and/or quality of output. To investigate this we conducted a comprehensive survey of all Canadian forestry-related publications listed in Forestry Abstracts from 1978 to 1992 inclusive. Results showed that overall Canadian output has remained steady at about 6% of the world total, and that its quality, as measured by the proportion of articles in scientific journals, has increased rather than decreased. Over the 15-year survey period, the most frequent origin of those publications has shifted from the Canadian Forest Service (52% of the total in 1978-82, 29% in 1988-92) to the universities (22% in 1978-82, 48% in 1988-92), and the subject-matter focus of Canadian forestry publications has changed in keeping with new research and operational priorities. 3aforestry 3auniversity research 3apublications 3asurveys 3aCanada 0ainternational comparisons 0atrends 0asecondary journals 0aquality 0agovernment research1 aPage, G.0 tForestry chronicle.g1994 , v. 70, no. 2 p.148-150wJournal:12176x0015-75467nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.5558/tfc70148-23Available from publisher's Web site  a19960202b19960208c00000000  aINDdNZM  aNon-US 7aarticle02316naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002800092040001800120100001900138245005600157300001600213500002300229520106500252650001201317650002601329650001501355650003501370650002201405650002501427650001201452650001301464650002101477653002101498653003501519653001401554653002601568653002101594653002101615700001801636773007201654852000901726856007801735930003301813945001301846946001101859655001201870IND2049452920221118061405.0960116e199412  onc|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204945292DNAL7 a10.5558/tfc70768-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWightman, R.A.10aForest neighbourhoods for timber harvest scheduling  ap. 768-772.  aSummary in French.  aForest management involves exploring through time the scheduling opportunities for timber and non-timber values within a forest. The ability to identify and form neighbourhoods--areas of suitable stand conditions and locations--is critical to this endeavour. This paper presents a GIS-based algorithm for identifying and forming forest neighbourhoods suitable for timber harvest scheduling. The resulting neighbourhoods are contiguous and overlapping, composed of stands sharing similar attributes. Similarity is based on a definable similarity list where stand conditions closest to one another in the list are most similar to one another. The algorithm is demonstrated with a single stand example and then a small forest example. Control of neighbourhood size is limited using a vector data model, except in forests composed of small stands. The examples illustrate that neighbourhood inclusion is dependent on both a forest stand's condition and relative position in the forest. The paper concludes with suggestions for further development of the algorithm. 3aforests 3astand characteristics 3aalgorithms 3ageographic information systems 3asimulation models 3aspatial distribution 3alogging 3aplanning 3aforest inventory 0amanagement units 0aneighborhood forming algorithm 0agisforman 0aharvest neighborhoods 0asimilarity index 0alogging schedule1 aBaskent, E.Z.0 tForestry chronicle.g1994 , v. 70, no. 6 p.768-772x0015-75467nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.5558/tfc70768-63Available from publisher's Web site  a19960202b19960208c00000000  aINDdNZM  aNon-US 7aarticle02576naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002800092040001800120100001800138245008900156300001600245500002300261520128200284650001101566650002601577650002001603650002401623650001101647650001701658650001401675650002001689650001301709650002101722650001701743650002301760650001801783651001201801653002501813653002201838653001001860700001601870773007601886852000901962856007801971930003302049945001302082946001102095655001202106IND2049325420221118061402.0951226e199006  onc|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204932542DNAL7 a10.5558/tfc66281-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMagnussen, S.10aGenetic improvement of volume and wood properties of jack pine: selection strategies  ap. 281-286.  aSummary in French.  aSix selection strategies aimed at genetically improving volume production and wood quality factors such as density, heartwood content, and stem taper are compared in a 20-year-old jack pine progeny trial. Selection indices were computed under various assumptions about economic values of the traits under selection and with constraints on the magnitude and direction of expected genetic gain. Stem taper, wood density, and heartwood content were under strong genetic control; however, the low phenotypic variation of wood density limits its potential for genetic improvement. Heartwood content emerged as a trait amenable for rapid genetic improvement. Despite low heritabilities the prospect of improving size-related traits was promising due to substantial phenotypic variation. Economic weights were important for the selection outcome and good progress was reported in all traits when volume received the highest weight. It was feasible to limit genetic gain in individual traits to predetermined relative levels but the cost in terms of reduced gain in unrestricted traits was economically debilitating. Concerns about undesirable concomitant changes in wood density, heartwood, and stem taper when breeding is based solely on growth traits were not confirmed by our data. 3aheight 3aplant characteristics 3aPinus banksiana 3agenetic improvement 3avolume 3awood density 3aheartwood 3aselection index 3adiameter 3agenetic variance 3aheritability 3aselection criteria 3atree breeding 3aOntario 0aphenotypic selection 0acorrelated traits 0ataper1 aKeith, C.T.0 tForestry chronicle.g1990 June, v. 66, no. 3 p.281-286x0015-75467nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.5558/tfc66281-33Available from publisher's Web site  a19960202b19960208c00000000  aINDdNZM  aNon-US 7aarticle01562naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002800092040001800120100001600138245006800154300001600222500014000238500002300378520045700401650001700858650002600875650002000901650001700921650001900938650001300957651001100970773008700981852000901068856007801077930003301155945001301188946001101201655001201212IND2059886220221118061138.0970925e199607  onc|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205988622DNAL7 a10.5558/tfc72370-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aQuiring, D.10aMechanisms of resistance of white spruce to the spruce bud moth  ap. 370-373.  aPaper presented at the workshop on "Silvicultural Approaches to Integrated Insect Management," October 16-19, 1994, Winnipeg, Manitoba.  aSummary in French.  aThere is a genetic basis to resistance of open-grown white spruce trees to their primary pest, the spruce bud moth, Zeiraphera canadensis Mutt. & Free. Resistance is attributable to late bud-burst and unknown factors associated with higher predation and parasitism of eggs and mortality of old larvae. Results suggest that tree resistance could be incorporated with other silvicultural procedures into an integrated management program for white spruce. 3aPicea glauca 3aZeiraphera canadensis 3apest resistance 3asilviculture 3ainsect control 3agenotype 3aCanada0 tForestry chronicle.g1996 , v. 72, no. 4 p.370-373wJournal:12176x0015-75467nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.5558/tfc72370-43Available from publisher's Web site  a19971102b19971106c00000000  aINDdJYB  aNon-US 7aarticle02578naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245012100169300001600290520128800306592002801594650001501622650003001637650001301667650001401680650001301694650001501707650001301722650001701735650002101752653001401773653001301787653001301800653001201813653000801825653001701833653001901850700005601869700001601925773010801941856008602049852000902135655001202144IND60540742720221122005349.0190318e20140215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054074272DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbpol.2013.10.0532doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSweeney, I.R.10aAbsorbent alginate fibres modified with hydrolysed chitosan for wound care dressings – II. Pilot scale development  ap. 920-927.  aFibres have been used extensively in wound dressing applications as they provide a high surface area for absorption, ease of fabrication and softness. It is common practice for commercial wound dressings to be produced from natural materials, such a marine polysaccharides, as they are predominantly biocompatible, non-toxic, and often display bioactive properties, such as inherent antimicrobial activity. In this study hydrolysed chitosans were utilised as a sole coagulant for the production of alginate–chitosan fibres via a one-step, direct wet-spinning extrusion process. The levels of chitosan incorporated into the fibres were analysed quantitatively via elemental analysis and qualitatively by staining using Amido Black 10B. It was estimated that the fibres contained between 4.50 and 5.10% (wt.%) chitosan. The presence of chitosan improved tensile properties such as elongation and tenacity of the base alginate fibres. The increased incorporation of chitosan into the fibres also improved the absorption of the fibres in both saline and distilled water; reaching maximum of >30g/g and >50g/g, respectively. This work suggests that the observed hydrolysed chitosan content within the fibre may be optimal for the preparation of a novel fibre for wound care application.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3aanti-infective properties 3achitosan 3aextrusion 3ahardness 3ahydrolysis 3astaining 3asurface area 3atensile strength 0aAbsorbent 0aAlginate 0aChitosan 0aGelling 0aPEC 0aWet-spinning 0aWound dressing1 aMiraftab, M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6333-38521 aCollyer, G.0 tCarbohydrate polymers.g2014 Feb. 15, v. 102 p.920-927dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl47819x0144-86177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbpol.2013.10.0533Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02789naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001300152245011700165300001600282520143200298592002801730650001301758650002601771650002501797650001701822650001001839650001001849650002801859650002401887653002101911653002201932653002101954653002201975653002301997653003002020700001502050700001802065700001902083700005302102773010402155856008702259852000902346655001202355IND60557492320221121232019.0180904e201611  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055749232DNAL7 a10.1016/j.atmosenv.2016.09.0572doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Yi13aAn experimental kinetic study and products research of the reactions of O3 with a series of unsaturated alcohols  ap. 455-467.  aThe gas-phase reactions of unsaturated alcohols with O3 were investigated in FEP Teflon film chamber at 298 K and 760 torr of atmosphere pressure. The rate constants of the reactions of C6-C8 alkenols with O3 were determined using both the absolute and the relative rate method, and the measured values were (5.96 ± 0.35) × 10⁻¹⁷ cm³ molecule⁻¹ s⁻¹ for (Z)-3-hexen-1-ol, (5.12 ± 0.30) × 10⁻¹⁷ cm³ molecule⁻¹ s⁻¹ for (Z)-3-hepten-1-ol, and (5.66 ± 0.52) × 10⁻¹⁷ cm³ molecule⁻¹ s⁻¹ for (Z)-3-octen-1-ol, respectively. The gas-phase products of these reactions mentioned above were detected using proton-transfer-reaction mass spectrum (PTR-MS). HOCH2CH2CHO, CH2CH2CHO, HCHO and CH3CHO were identified as the main gas products for (Z)-3-hexen-1-ol. HOCH2CH2CHO and CH3(CH2)2CHO dominated the gaseous products for (Z)-3-hepten-1-ol. And for (Z)-3-octen-1-ol, CH3(CH2)3CHO, CH3(CH2)2CHO and HOCH2CH2CHO were the main gaseous products. The SOA yields were monitored at the same time, which were 0.184 ± 0.013, 0.213 ± 0.017, 0.232 ± 0.021 for (Z)-3-hexen-1-ol, (Z)-3-hepten-1-ol and (Z)-3-octen-1-ol, respectively. The possible reaction mechanisms were proposed and discussed. The kinetic data presented here has been used to estimate their atmosphere lifetimes and the reaction reactivity. The atmosphere implication of these reactions has also been discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalcohols 3aatmospheric chemistry 3aatmospheric pressure 3aformaldehyde 3agases 3aozone 3apolytetrafluoroethylene 3areaction mechanisms 0a(Z)-3-hexen-1-ol 0a(Z)-3-hepten-1-ol 0a(Z)-3-octen-1-ol 0aRate coefficients 0aGas-phase products 0aSecondary organic aerosol1 aWang, Jing1 aZhao, Sanping1 aTong, Shengrui1 aGe, Maofa1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7763-70160 tAtmospheric environment.g2016 Nov., v. 145 p.455-467dElsevier LtdwJournal:12031x1352-23107nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.atmosenv.2016.09.0573Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01825naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245013000159300002000289520085600309592002801165650001401193650002301207650002601230650001101256650001401267700001901281700001501300773012401315856007501439852000901514655001201523IND60636130320221120193239.0190505e20170323xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063613032DNAL7 a10.1039/c6ra28743c2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTāhera, Ābu,10aHighly efficient metal organic framework (MOF)-based copper catalysts for the base-free aerobic oxidation of various alcohols  ap. 17806-17812.  aCopper (Cu) containing metal organic frameworks (MOFs) are found to be highly efficient heterogeneous catalysts for oxidation of various alcohols. A wide range of alcohols, including alcohols containing inactive hetero-aryl and long-chain alkyl units, are selectively converted into their corresponding products. The catalytic efficiency of the Cu containing MOFs, along with the co-catalyst 2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-piperidyl-1-oxy (TEMPO), was demonstrated by the high conversion of the reactants with 100% selectivity under base-free conditions. The use of an inexpensive copper containing catalyst, the broad substrate scope, and the open air conditions and absence of base additive make this protocol very practical. The catalyst maintained a unique structural framework and it could be reused at least five times without significant loss of activity.  aPublisher supplied data 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3acoordination polymers 3acopper 3aoxidation1 aKim, Dong Wook1 aLee, Ik-Mo0 tRSC advances.g2017 Mar. 23, v. 7, no. 29 p.17806-17812dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c6ra28743c3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01767naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002200149245014700171300001600318520053900334592002800873650001200901650002300913650002300936650001300959650001600972650001700988650001801005650001401023700001901037700006401056700002101120700005401141773011801195856008301313852000901396655001201405IND60681736520221119015259.0200117e20191231xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068173652DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.orglett.9b043142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYamamoto, Keitaro10aQuinoidal Oligothiophenes Having Full Benzene Annelation: Synthesis, Properties, Structures, and Acceptor Application in Organic Photovoltaics  ap. 547-551.  aTo achieve a complete closed-shell quinoidal state, bis(dicyanomethylene)-substituted quinoidal terthiophenes bearing benzene annelation at all thiophene rings were synthesized using a retro-Diels–Alder reaction as the key step.

In this study an experimental design was performed to find the optimal refolding condition for reteplase. The influence of 14 chemical additives was assessed by one factor at a time method and then Taguchi design followed by response surface methodology was employed to find compounds with most significant effects on reteplase refolding and their optimum concentration. We found that 0.13 M histidine, 1.64 M methionine, 0.33 M cysteine, and 0.34 M arginine in addition to the GSH/GSSG is the optimal condition for refolding of reteplase. We also investigated the refolding yield for inclusion bodies obtained from different E. coli strains and found that BL21 (DE3) has the best recovery yield in comparison to Rosetta-gami and Shuffle T7.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3aarginine 3acysteine 3adisulfides 3aexperimental design 3ahistidine 3ahumans 3amethionine 3aresponse surface methodology 3at-plasminogen activator 0aReteplase 0aRefolding 0aChemical chaperon1 aMaghsoudi, Amirhossein1 aMaghsoudi, Nader1 aNiazi, Sepideh1 aSoleiman, Morvarid0 tInternational journal of biological macromolecules.g2020 Dec. 01, v. 164 p.1321-1327dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12340x0141-81307nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2020.07.1833Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02405naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001900148245010700167300001200274500001900286520109500305592002801400650002401428650001701452650001701469650002401486650004301510650001201553650001401565650001101579650000701590700002001597700002401617700002201641700002201663700005901685700001501744700001501759773011701774856008301891852000901974655001201983IND60705282420221121043150.0201024e202008  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070528242DNAL7 a10.1007/s13205-020-02363-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSrinivasan, P.10aChlorpyrifos degradation efficiency of Bacillus sp. laccase immobilized on iron magnetic nanoparticles  ap. 366.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe present study explored the immobilization of laccase onto iron magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) to enhance its enzymatic properties and applications. The immobilization process was optimized using Box–Behnken design (BBD). BBD showed significance towards the quadratic model with experimental data. Maximum laccase activity recovery (99%) of the predicted model was observed at 0.75 mg/mL of laccase concentration, 200 mg/mL of MNPs, 0.3% cross linking with carbodiimide, and 3 h of cross-linking time. The magnetization activity of MNPs (8 emu/g) and the immobilized laccase with MNPs (4 emu/g) was analyzed using vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM). Maximum activity of immobilized laccase was observed at pH 7.0 and 55 °C. The immobilized laccase has greater stability (100 h) and significant chlorpyrifos (pesticide) degradation activity. High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) results confirmed the degraded metabolic products of chlorpyrifos. In all, the immobilized laccase was superior to free laccase, showing promising structural and application characteristics.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacillus (bacteria) 3achlorpyrifos 3acrosslinking 3aexperimental design 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3alaccase 3amagnetism 3amodels 3apH1 aSelvankumar, T.1 aParay, Bilal Ahamad1 aRehman, Muneeb U.1 aKamala-Kannan, S.1 aGovarthanan, M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8725-30591 aKim, Woong1 aSelvam, K.0 t3 Biotech.g2020 Aug., v. 10, no. 8 p.366-366dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:22884x2190-572X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13205-020-02363-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02813naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100002400142245010100166300001600267520148000283592002801763650002001791650002301811650003101834650001301865650001401878650002201892650002101914650001401935650000901949650001601958650001901974650001301993651000902006653002202015653002702037653002302064653001902087653001802106700002102124700002002145773010502165856007602270852000902346655001202355IND60682080020221118045151.0200124e20200123xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068208002DNAL7 a10.1675/063.042.04082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKawasaki, Martha T.10aFrequent Use of Upland Habitats by the Endangered Hawaiian Stilt (Himantopus mexicanus knudseni)  ap. 431-438.  aThe Hawaiian Stilt, or Ae'o (Himantopus mexicanus knudseni), is an endangered waterbird endemic to the Hawaiian Islands. Loss of suitable wetland habitats due to anthropogenic development is a leading cause for decline, as well as the introduction of non-native predators and invasive wetland plants. This study fitted four Hawaiian Stilts with GPS satellite tags to document their use of wetland and surrounding habitats on Oahu Island. While other Hawaiian waterbirds are largely restricted to wetlands, we detected Hawaiian Stilts using heavily modified upland habitats, including developed areas, undeveloped fields, sports fields, as well as wetland habitats over a 6-month period. Overall, a high use of non-wetland habitat was observed (up to 58%), with significant differences in habitat occupancy among individual stilts and across different times of day. Wetlands were the dominant habitat occupied from morning to early afternoon, but non-wetland habitats were occupied at higher frequencies in the evening and early morning hours. Although only four birds were tracked, the extensive use of non-wetland habitat by these individuals indicates non-wetland habitats may be important for the conservation of this subspecies. However, more research is needed to understand how applicable these results are to other stilt populations across the Hawaiian Islands, and better understand the potential risks and benefits of these non-wetland habitats to stilt populations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aathletic fields 3aendangered species 3aglobal positioning systems 3ahabitats 3ahighlands 3aintroduced plants 3ainvasive species 3apredators 3arisk 3awater birds 3awetland plants 3awetlands 3aOahu 0aendemic waterbird 0aGPS satellite tracking 0ahabitat occurrence 0aHawaiian Stilt 0aurban habitat1 aHart, Patrick J.1 aPaxton, Eben H.0 tWaterbirds.g2020 Jan. 23, v. 42, no. 4 p.431-438dWaterbirds SocietywJournal:6297x1524-46957nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1675/063.042.04083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03198naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245014200167300001800309520181200327592002802139650000802167650002202175650001602197650001702213650001702230650002202247650001402269650001002283650001102293650002202304650001402326650001802340650001302358650005202371650002202423650001202445650003102457650002902488650001102517700001802528773010402546856008102650852000902731655001202740IND60080222420221119200335.0150216e201408  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008022242DNAL7 a10.1007/s11738-014-1604-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTaneja, Dhakshi10aMolecular cloning, sequence analyses, and expression studies of sucrose-phosphate synthase in the potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) cultivars  ap. 2253-2269.  aSucrose-phosphate synthase (SPS, EC 2.4.1.14) refers to a key enzyme in sucrose biosynthesis in both photosynthetic and nonphotosynthetic tissues of plants. It is encoded by different gene families. SPS exists in multiple forms which show differential distributions and functional specializations in the plant tissues. SPS activity is highly regulated by hierarchy of mechanisms including transcriptional control. Here, we report an isolation of a cDNA clone (3,591 bp) encoding full-length SPS A form consisting of 1,054 amino acids (designated KC-SPS1) from a commercially important Indian potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) cultivar, Kufri Chipsona-1 by RT-PCR approach from tuber total RNA. KC-SPS1 shared 99 % sequence identity with 1,053-amino acid SPS from potato cv. Desiree. Apart from some prominent amino acid substitutions, one extra Met residue at position 235 made KC-SPS1 a distinct member of SPS A family in potato. Full-length SPS sequences from taxonomically different plant species were used in making a phylogenetic tree which showed both evolutionary relatedness, and also their grouping into different SPS families. Hydropathy characters and secondary structures were predicted in various SPS forms. Sequence analyses and comparison of the SPS sequences from the Solanaceae family members revealed many distinct features within and between the SPS gene families which were not documented earlier. SPS A form-specific expression patterns were studied in the leaves and tubers of different potato cultivars based on semi-quantitative RT-PCR and protein blot analyses. SPS activities particularly in the cold-stored tubers were probably due to altered kinetic properties. This report would be useful for in-depth studies on various SPS isoforms in potato and other Solanaceae family members.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRNA 3aSolanum tuberosum 3aamino acids 3abiosynthesis 3acold storage 3acomplementary DNA 3acultivars 3agenes 3aleaves 3amolecular cloning 3aphylogeny 3aplant tissues 3apotatoes 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3asequence analysis 3asucrose 3asucrose-phosphate synthase 3atranscription (genetics) 3atubers1 aDas, Niranjan0 tActa physiologiae plantarum.g2014 Aug., v. 36, no. 8 p.2253-2269dSpringer-Verlagx0137-58817nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11738-014-1604-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03425naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002200151245013800173300001600311520180700327592002802134650001502162650001702177650002002194650001502214650001602229650001802245650001802263650001302281650001102294650003102305650002802336650002302364650002002387650001302407650001302420653004002433653002802473653003102501653002402532653002902556653002202585700001702607700002302624700002202647700001902669700002402688773008902712856008502801852000902886655001202895IND60599398520221119210934.0180702e201403  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059939852DNAL7 a10.1016/j.talanta.2013.11.0722doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchaefer, Cédric12aA Process Analytical Technology (PAT) approach to control a new API manufacturing process: Development, validation and implementation  ap. 114-125.  aPharmaceutical companies are progressively adopting and introducing Process Analytical Technology (PAT) and Quality-by-Design (QbD) concepts promoted by the regulatory agencies, aiming the building of the quality directly into the product by combining thorough scientific understanding and quality risk management. An analytical method based on near infrared (NIR) spectroscopy was developed as a PAT tool to control on-line an API (active pharmaceutical ingredient) manufacturing crystallization step during which the API and residual solvent contents need to be precisely determined to reach the predefined seeding point. An original methodology based on the QbD principles was designed to conduct the development and validation of the NIR method and to ensure that it is fitted for its intended use. On this basis, Partial least squares (PLS) models were developed and optimized using chemometrics methods. The method was fully validated according to the ICH Q2(R1) guideline and using the accuracy profile approach. The dosing ranges were evaluated to 9.0–12.0% w/w for the API and 0.18–1.50% w/w for the residual methanol. As by nature the variability of the sampling method and the reference method are included in the variability obtained for the NIR method during the validation phase, a real-time process monitoring exercise was performed to prove its fit for purpose. The implementation of this in-process control (IPC) method on the industrial plant from the launch of the new API synthesis process will enable automatic control of the final crystallization step in order to ensure a predefined quality level of the API. In addition, several valuable benefits are expected including reduction of the process time, suppression of a rather difficult sampling and tedious off-line analyses.  aPublisher supplied data 3aautomation 3achemometrics 3acrystallization 3aguidelines 3aingredients 3aleast squares 3amanufacturing 3amethanol 3amodels 3anear-infrared spectroscopy 3apharmaceutical industry 3aprocess monitoring 3arisk management 3asampling 3asolvents 0aProcess Analytical Technology (PAT) 0aQuality-by-Design (QbD) 0aNear infrared spectroscopy 0aAPI crystallization 0aIn-process control (IPC) 0aMethod validation1 aClicq, David1 aLecomte, Clémence1 aMerschaert, Alain1 aNorrant, Edith1 aFotiadu, Frédéric0 tTalanta.g2014 Mar., v. 120 p.114-125dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11742x0039-91407nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.talanta.2013.11.0723Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02856naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001500152245012300167300001600290500001900306520110200325592002801427650001501455650001501470650001701485650001301502650001101515650001601526650001801542650001101560650003001571650001501601650001101616650001401627650001501641650002101656653004301677653003401720653001601754653002301770653004901793653001901842700002001861700002301881700002001904700001701924700002201941700002101963700002001984700002402004700001902028773013502047856008702182852000902269655001202278IND60704761320221116193142.0201111e20201201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070476132DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2020.07.1842doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGoto, Miwa10aEffects of surface-deacetylated chitin nanofibers on non-alcoholic steatohepatitis model rats and their gut microbiota  ap. 659-666.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aNonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), a more advanced form of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), is associated with increased cardiovascular and liver-related mortality. Stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRSP5/Dmcr) that are fed a high-fat and high-cholesterol diet develop hepatic lesions that are similar to those observed in human NASH pathology. We investigated the hepatic protective and antioxidant effects of surface-deacetylated chitin nanofibers (SDACNFs) that were administered to SHRSP5/Dmcr rats for 8 weeks. The administration of SDACNFs (80 mg/kg/day) resulted in a significant decrease in hepatic injury, oxidative stress, compared with the non-treatment. The SDACNFs also caused a reduction in the population of harmful members of the Morganella and Prevotella genus, and increased the abundance of the Blautia genus, a useful bacterium in gut microbiota. We therefore conclude that SDACNF exerts anti-hepatic and antioxidative effects not only by adsorbing lipid substances but also by reforming the community of intestinal microflora in the intestinal tract.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMorganella 3aPrevotella 3aantioxidants 3abacteria 3achitin 3afatty liver 3ahigh fat diet 3ahumans 3aintestinal microorganisms 3aintestines 3alipids 3amortality 3ananofibers 3aoxidative stress 0aSurface-deacetylated chitin nanofibers 0aNon-alcoholic steatohepatitis 0aAntioxidant 0aHepatic protection 0aStroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats 0aGut microbiota1 aIohara, Daisuke1 aMichihara, Akihiro1 aIfuku, Shinsuke1 aAzuma, Kazuo1 aKadowaki, Daisuke1 aMaruyama, Tōru,1 aOtagiri, Masaki1 aHirayama, Fumitoshi1 aAnraku, Makoto0 tInternational journal of biological macromolecules.g2020 Dec. 01, v. 164 p.659-666dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12340x0141-81307nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2020.07.1843Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02485naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245010200169300001800271520097400289592002801263650002901291650001401320650001501334650001701349650001501366650001101381650001701392650001501409650002001424650001101444653002301455653002701478653002501505653002301530653002501553653002701578700001601605700001601621700001501637700001401652700001801666700005601684700001801740700001601758773011001774856008601884852000901970655001201979IND60540742920221122005302.0220326e20140130xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054074292DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbpol.2013.10.0552doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFortunati, E.10aNano-biocomposite films with modified cellulose nanocrystals and synthesized silver nanoparticles  ap. 1122-1133.  aTernary nano-biocomposite films based on poly(lactic acid) (PLA) with modified cellulose nanocrystals (s-CNC) and synthesized silver nanoparticles (Ag) have been prepared and characterized.

The positive effects of the addition of cellulose and silver on the PLA barrier properties were confirmed by reductions in the water permeability (WVP) and oxygen transmission rate (OTR) of the films tested. The migration level of all nano-biocomposites in contact with food simulants were below the permitted limits in both non-polar and polar simulants.

Field surveys and greenhouse experiments were carried out to explore, using spatial analysis, how a strong invader, namely Spartina alterniflora, is assisted by such activities as constructing levees and digging trenches, ditches, and pits in a tidal salt marsh. These activities changed the lateral hydrological connectivity of a salt marsh. The invasibility was then estimated based on the probability of seed dispersal and retention using the classical probabilistic method, and the rate of seedling emergence using threshold analysis. Changes in lateral hydrological connectivity led to more seeds of the invading species being retained, especially in high marshes, and promoted the emergence of its seedlings by making the soil more moist and less saline. The results suggest that changes in the lateral hydrological connectivity in a salt marsh can make it more prone to being invaded. The results have important implications for the control of invasive plants by limiting human activity and thereby regulating lateral hydrological connectivity in coastal ecosystems.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSpartina alterniflora 3aecological invasion 3agreenhouses 3ahabitats 3ahumans 3ahydrology 3ainvasive species 3aprobability 3ariver deltas 3asalt marshes 3aseed dispersal 3aseedling emergence 3asoil 3aChina 3aYellow River 0aPlant invasion 0aTidal inundation1 aWang, Qing1 aNing, Zhonghua1 aChen, Cong1 aCui, Baoshan1 aBai, Junhong1 aShi, Wei1 aPang, Bo0 tScience of the total environment.g2021 May 15, v. 769 p.144476-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.1444763Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02474naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100002000142245009400162300001600256520127800272592002801550650001901578650001201597650001901609650001201628650001001640650001001650650001601660650001301676651001601689653002601705653002201731653001501753653002101768653002401789700001601813700001601829700001701845773010501862856007601967852000902043655001202052IND60682080120221118044923.0200124e20200123xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068208012DNAL7 a10.1675/063.042.04092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPark, Jong-Hyun10aVariation in Biparental Incubation Patterns of the Black-Faced Spoonbill (Platalea minor)  ap. 439-445.  aThis study was conducted using wildlife cameras at nests in a colony of Black-faced Spoonbill (Platalea minor) on Mae-do Islet (37° 34′ 07.17″ N, 126° 35′ 08.10″ E), Incheon, South Korea to monitor and examine the variation in incubation patterns between males and females among four different stages of incubation (Egg-laying, Early-, Mid-, and Late-incubation stage). Mean egg-incubation bout length was longer for females (Egg-laying stage = 6.55 ± 0.44 hr SE; Early-incubation = 7.34 ± 0.48 hr; Mid-incubation = 7.22 ± 0.44 hr; Late-incubation = 7.89 ± 0.58 hr) than for males (Egg-Laying = 4.55 ± 0.39 hr; Early-incubation = 6.35 ± 0.46 hr; Mid-incubation = 6.94 ± 0.40 hr; Late-incubation = 7.07 ± 0.51 hr), but the differences in average incubation bout length between females and males decreased after the Egg-laying stage. Females incubated a greater proportion of time during nighttime (Females: 88.21 ± 3.73%; Males: 11.79 ± 3.73%), and males incubated a greater proportion of time during daytime (Female: 25.19 ± 3.48%, Male: 74.80 ± 3.48%) after the egg-laying stage.

Thus, the invasive species Callidiellum villosulum (Fairmaire) (tribe Callidiini) and a second species, Xylotrechus buqueti (Castelnau & Gory) (tribe Clytini), were specifically attracted to the blend of 3-hydroxy-hexan-2-one and the pyrrole. In contrast, Allotreus asiaticus (Schwarzer) (tribe Phoracanthini) and Semanotus bifasciatus Motschulsky (tribe Callidiini) were specifically attracted to the pyrrole as a single component. In most cases, both males and females were attracted, indicating that the compounds are likely to be aggregation-sex pheromones. The results indicate that the two compounds are conserved as pheromone components among species within at least three tribes within the subfamily Cerambycinae. For practical purposes, the attractants could find immediate use in surveillance programs aimed at detecting incursions of these species into new areas of the world, including the United States.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCallidiellum 3aSemanotus 3aXylotrechus 3aattractants 3afemales 3afield experimentation 3ainvasive species 3amales 3amonitoring 3apheromones 3apyrroles 3aChina 3aUnited States 0a3-hydroxyhexan-2-one 0a1-(1H-pyrrol-2-yl)-1,2-propanedione 0aaggregation-sex pheromone 0aattractant1 aLu, Wen1 aZhang, Long-Wa1 aChen, Yi1 aZou, Yunfan1 aHanks, Lawrence M.1 aMillar, Jocelyn G.0 tJournal of economic entomology.g2016 Aug. 27, v. 109, no. 5 p.2243-2246dEntomological Society of AmericawJournal:jnl46276x0022-04937nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jee/tow1873Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02865naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002600151245015700177300001600334520114900350592002801499650001601527650001701543650002201560650001301582650001401595650001101609650001501620650001701635650001401652650001301666650001601679650001201695650000901707650001701716650001501733653001201748653001701760653001301777653001601790653001901806653001001825700002801835700002801863700002101891700002701912700001801939700002401957700002101981700002602002700001902028700001502047773011802062856008602180852000902266655001202275IND60581679320221121092916.0220830e20161201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058167932DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jenvman.2016.09.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aImatiāza, Muhammada,10aSilicon occurrence, uptake, transport and mechanisms of heavy metals, minerals and salinity enhanced tolerance in plants with future prospects: A review  ap. 521-529.  aRecently, heavy metals pollution due to industrialization and urbanization, use of untreated wastewater and unreasonable use of pesticides and fertilizers is increasing rapidly, resulting in major threat to the environment and contaminate soils. Silicon (Si) is the second most abundant element in the earth crust after oxygen. Although it's higher accumulation in plants, yet Si has not been listed as essential nutrient however, considered as beneficial element for growth of plants particularly in stressed environment. Research to date has demonstrated that silicon helps the plants to alleviate the various biotic and abiotic stresses. This review article presents a comprehensive update about Si and heavy metals, minerals and salinity stresses, and contained the progress about Si so far done worldwide in the light of previous studies to evaluate the ecological importance of Si. Moreover, this review will also be helpful to understand the Si uptake ability and its benefits on plants grown under stressed environment. Further research needs for Si-mediated mitigation of heavy metals and mineral nutrients stresses are also discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3afertilizers 3aheavy metals 3aindustrialization 3aminerals 3anutrients 3aoxygen 3apesticides 3aplant growth 3apollution 3asalinity 3asalt stress 3asilicon 3asoil 3aurbanization 3awastewater 0aSilicon 0aHeavy metals 0aSalinity 0aAlleviation 0aAbiotic stress 0aPlant1 aRizwan, Muhammad Shahid1 aMushtaq, Muhammad Adnan1 aAshraf, Muhammad1 aShahzad, Sher Muhammad1 aYousaf, Balal1 aSaeed, Dawood Anser1 aRizwan, Muhammad1 aNawaz, Muhammad Azher1 aMehmood, Sajid1 aTu, Shuxin0 tJournal of environmental management.g2016 Dec. 01, v. 183 p.521-529dElsevier LtdwJournal:2018x0301-47977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2016.09.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03651naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100002000141245009500161300001600256520192900272592002802201650001302229650001302242650002002255650002302275650003002298650001702328650002602345650001002371650001202381650001302393650002302406650002302429650002102452650002002473650002002493650001902513650001202532651001202544651001202556651001002568651001202578651001202590651001102602651002902613651001202642651002302654651001402677653001802691653001802709653001202727653001702739700002102756700002102777773015502798856007502953852000903028655001203037IND60682080320221118044917.0200124e20200122xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068208032DNAL7 a10.1017/inp.2019.242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlomran, Maryam10aVentenata dubia's native range and consideration of plant pathogens for biological control  ap. 242-245.  aVentenata [Ventenata dubia (Leers) Coss.] is a nonindigenous, invasive grass in the inland Pacific Northwest (PNW) of the United States. It appears to be present in the PNW without any evidence of disease expression. Surveys of V. dubia in the PNW (Idaho, Montana, Oregon, and Washington) were entirely negative for fungi, including types of pathogens that might be expected in grasses (e.g., rust, powdery mildew, choke). In Europe, where V. dubia is native, fungi were documented (i.e., Septoria ventenatae Sandu, Tilletia fusca Ellis & Everh., and Tilletia elisabethae T. Denchev & Denchev) on V. dubia. In its native range there likely are natural enemies that may limit V. dubia abundance, and these may include fungal pathogens. Pathogens of V. dubia from its native range may hold potential for use as classical biological control agents in North America, and if deemed safe, could be introduced. To ascertain V. dubia's native range, we compiled data from herbarium specimens, consulted with herbarium curators in the region, and searched relevant literature. We found that V. dubia primarily is reported in southern Europe and western Asia. Ventenata dubia has been reported only occasionally from North Africa in Algeria and Morocco. The common name “North Africa grass” likely originated from references to V. dubia in the 19th-century botanical explorations in Algeria of the French botanist, Ernest Cosson, who published the current scientific name based on a preexisting name in 1854. Another finding of interest is that the latitudinal range of collections from Europe and North Africa of V. dubia spans Tunisia to Finland. The plant may thus be adapted to a range of environments, indicating it could become more widely distributed in North America. Efforts to search its native range for pathogens should also consider the range of environmental conditions found within its native and introduced ranges.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSeptoria 3aTilletia 3aVentenata dubia 3abiological control 3abiological control agents 3acommon names 3aenvironmental factors 3afungi 3agrasses 3aherbaria 3aindigenous species 3aintroduced species 3ainvasive species 3anatural enemies 3aplant pathogens 3apowdery mildew 3asurveys 3aAlgeria 3aFinland 3aIdaho 3aMontana 3aMorocco 3aOregon 3aSouthern European region 3aTunisia 3aWashington (state) 3aWest Asia 0adistributions 0aenemy release 0ainvader 0anative range1 aNewcombe, George1 aPrather, Timothy0 tInvasive plant science and management.g2020 Jan. 22, v. 12, no. 4 p.242-245dThe Weed Science Society of AmericawJournal:jnl4194316x1939-747X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/inp.2019.243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02322naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001400143245014800157300001800305520102900323592002801352650001801380650000901398650001501407650001601422650001601438650001001454650002101464650001101485650001401496650001101510650002101521650003001542700001601572700001201588700001301600700001101613700001301624700001301637700001601650700001301666773009901679856007701778852000901855655001201864IND60083325420221121103506.0141101e201104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008332542DNAL7 a10.3168/jds.2010-38012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGuo, C.F.10aShort communication: A sensitive method for qualitative screening of bile salt hydrolase-active lactobacilli based on thin-layer chromatography  ap. 1732-1737.  aA sensitive protocol based on thin-layer chromatography (TLC) was developed to screen qualitatively bile salt hydrolase (BSH)-active lactobacilli. The sodium salts of glycocholic acid and taurocholic acid were used as substrates, and bacterial BSH activity was confirmed by detecting cholic acid as a product of the bile conjugates using a TLC assay with direct visual observation. Forty-five lactobacilli isolated from human fecal samples were tested for BSH activity by the TLC assay, a conventional plate assay, and a quantitative colorimetric assay. With the TLC and quantitative colorimetric assays, the same 24 BSH-positive strains were detected. No false-positive or false-negative results were detected by the TLC assay. However, only 20 BSH-positive strains were detected with the conventional plate assay. Compared with the conventional plate assay, the TLC assay is more sensitive for the detection of BSH activity of lactobacilli and, thus, more suitable for screening of BSH-active lactobacilli of human origin.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLactobacillus 3abile 3abile salts 3acholic acid 3acolorimetry 3afeces 3aglycocholic acid 3ahumans 3ascreening 3asodium 3ataurocholic acid 3athin layer chromatography1 aZhang, L.W.1 aHan, X.1 aLi, J.Y.1 aDu, M.1 aYi, H.X.1 aFeng, Z.1 aZhang, Y.C.1 aXu, X.R.0 tJournal of dairy science.g2011 Apr., v. 94, no. 4 p.1732-1737dElsevier Inc.x0022-03027nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3168/jds.2010-38013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02737naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001700152245009800169300001600267520131500283592002801598650001301626650001101639650001301650650001201663650001801675650001901693650002501712650001601737650001101753650001901764650001101783650001701794650002101811650001501832650001301847650001001860650002401870650002801894650001001922650001201932700001701944700002201961700002301983773014102006856008702147852000902234655001202243IND60608436320221120035428.0200511e20100101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060843632DNAL7 a10.1080/14620316.2010.115126882doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKumar, Phani12aA carbon sequestration strategy involving temperate fruit crops in the trans-Himalayan region  ap. 405-409.  aA current major concern is increasing levels of atmospheric CO₂ which may be responsible for global warming or climate change. Fruit tree orchards have received attention in recent years by virtue of their potential to act as carbon pools. The trans-Himalayan valley (i.e., the Nubra Valley) at an altitude of 3,048 m, is covered by > 60,000 temperate fruit trees. The focus of this paper is on the potential of these fruit-yielding trees as a means of carbon sequestration in the Nubra Valley. The valley produces approx. 4,650 metric tonnes (MT) of apricot, apple, walnut, mulberry, grape, and plum fruit. It was observed that the total biomass of the temperate fruit trees (i.e., apricot, apple, and walnut) in the area surveyed was 40,000 MT dry weight (DW). Thus, 22,300 MT of carbon has been sequestered by these fruit species. This study revealed that the cultivation of temperate fruit crops species such as apricot, apple, and walnut could be exploited more efficiently for carbon sequestration which subsequently helps in mitigating global CO₂ levels and restoring degraded land in these cold, arid areas by improving soil organic carbon (SOC) contents. These results concluded, in part, that growing biomass to sequester carbon is a beneficial grow-and-store process for sustainable development.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaltitude 3aapples 3aapricots 3abiomass 3abiotechnology 3acarbon dioxide 3acarbon sequestration 3afruit crops 3afruits 3aglobal warming 3agrapes 3ahorticulture 3aland degradation 3amulberries 3aorchards 3aplums 3asoil organic carbon 3asustainable development 3atrees 3awalnuts1 aMurugan, Pal1 aMurkute, Ashutosh1 aBala Singh, SHashi0 tJournal of horticultural science & biotechnology.g2010 Jan. 1, v. 85, no. 5 p.405-409dTaylor & FranciswJournal:12181x2380-40847nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/14620316.2010.115126883Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02199naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001500140245009000155300001800245520089600263592002801159650001801187650001601205650001601221650001501237650001001252650001601262650001701278650001001295650001001305650001001315650001001325650002301335650001301358650001301371651000901384653002301393653001401416653001701430700002001447700001501467700001801482773014601500856007401646852000901720655001201729IND60680455620221122172748.0200105e20160827xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068045562DNAL7 a10.1093/jee/tow1952doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHejazi, M.10aNovel Chemo-Attractants for Trapping Tomato Leafminer Moth (Lepidoptera: Gelechiidae)  ap. 2074-2081.  aThe tomato leafminer moth, Tuta absoluta (Meyrick), is a devastating pest for tomatoes in Iran and throughout the world. This pest reduces tomato yields in farms and greenhouses. It appears some floral odors are significant attractants for tomato leafminer moth. In this study, the effects of three floral compounds, phenylacetaldehyde (PAA), acetic acid (AA), and 3-methyl-1-butanol (MB), were evaluated as trap attractants for tomato leafminer moth. The attractants were tested separately, combined, and blended in binary and tertiary. Lures were tested in delta and water pan traps under field conditions and compared with unbaited traps as controls. Results indicated that water pan traps caught more moths than delta traps. Also treatments with PAA + AA combined and the AA + MB blend were strongly attractive to tomato leafminer moth males compared with other treatments in this study.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTuta absoluta 3aacetic acid 3aattractants 3acrop yield 3afarms 3agreenhouses 3ainsect traps 3amales 3amoths 3aodors 3apests 3aphenylacetaldehyde 3atomatoes 3atrapping 3aIran 0a3-methyl-1-butanol 0atrap type 0anatural lure1 aMovahedi, M.

Migration counts from points strategically located on the coast can be a reliable and effective method of reaching this goal. We propose a consistent and statistically robust method for estimating such numbers by generalized additive modeling of the numbers passing during periods when counts are interrupted. This procedure has the advantage of accounting for the effects of covariates, such as wind, on the counts in a flexible manner, potentially increasing accuracy and precision. We develop a reliable method of estimating precision, based on a parametric bootstrap, and applied a sensitivity analysis to our models to test their accuracy. We demonstrate the method with three species of seabirds migrating through the Strait of Gibraltar. Estimated numbers of the Northern Gannet (Morus bassanus) are similar to the estimated Atlantic population that winters in the western Mediterranean Sea, while for both Cory's (Calonectris diomedea) and Balearic (Puffinus mauretanicus) Shearwaters they are greater than the current population estimates. These results have important implications in conservation and highlight the necessity for reestimation of the latter two species' global population. Potential sources of biases include the constraint on detectability due to distance and the possibility of double counting due to local movements. To avoid overestimates, we suggest that values imputed for the gaps in counts be conservative.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCalonectris diomedea 3aMorus bassanus 3aPuffinus 3acoasts 3amodels 3aseabirds 3awind 3awind farms 3awinter 3aMediterranean Sea 3aStrait of Gibraltar 0abird-migration volume 0aCalonectris diomedea 0amigration counts 0amigratory passage 0aMorus bassanus 0aparametric bootstrap 0aPuffinus mauretanicus 0atime gaps1 aThomas, Len1 aArroyo, Gonzalo M.0 tCondor.g2012 Aug., v. 114, no. 3 p.513-522dUniversity of California PresswJournal:19632x0010-54227nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1525/cond.2012.1000533Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02216naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001900152245011000171300001400281520099700295592002801292650002601320650001801346650001301364650001101377650001701388650001401405653002601419653001901445653001901464653002301483653001401506700006101520700006301581773010201644856008701746852000901833655001201842IND60557493020221120092624.0180904e201612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055749302DNAL7 a10.1016/j.atmosenv.2016.09.0642doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKnap, Hasse C.10aHydrogen shift reactions in four methyl-buten-ol (MBO) peroxy radicals and their impact on the atmosphere  ap. 79-87.  aWe investigate the hydrogen shift (H-shift) reactions in the peroxy radicals derived from four different methyl-buten-ol (MBO) molecules; 2-methyl-3-buten-2-ol (MBO232), 2-methyl-3-buten-1-ol (MBO231), 3-Methyl-3-buten-2-ol (MBO332) and 3-methyl-3-buten-1-ol (MBO331), with quantum mechanical calculations. The rate constants of the 1,5 H-shift reactions in all four MBO peroxy radicals are greater than the rate constants of the 1,4 or 1,6 H-shift reactions. The rate constants for the 1,5 H-shift reaction from either a CH group or an OH group are approximately 1 s⁻¹ and 10⁻³ s⁻¹, respectively. The atmospheric impact of the MBO232 oxidation is investigated with the global chemical transport model (GEOS-Chem). The 1,4-CH and 1,5-OH H-shift reactions in the MBO232 peroxy radical play a minor role with a total yield of about 2%.

Using a turbimetric methodology, concentration dependent suppression of phase transition temperature of HPMC was observed for phenol and its derivatives, including methyl-, nitro- and chloro-substituted molecules. Although no strong direct relationship between single molecular physicochemical properties of the phenolic compounds (such as pKₐ, LogP and other molecular descriptors) and ΔCPT was found for the compounds tested, a successful prediction of behaviour could be obtained by using a combination of parameters. This suggested that the interaction mechanism between HPMC and the substituted aromatic moiety is a complex summation of the different molecular physicochemical properties. Identification of these potentially deleterious chemical moieties may be of value in a pharmaceutical context when considering preformulation of drug structures containing them. An incompatibility between drug and polymer may be indicative of deleterious effects resulting from formulation with hydrophilic matrix dosage forms containing cellulose ethers such as HPMC.  aPublisher supplied data 3aphase transition 3amethylcellulose 3aaqueous solutions 3adrugs 3aphenol 3ahydrophilicity 3aethers 3agels 3adrug formulations 3apolymers 3atemperature 3aprediction 0aHPMC 0aPhase transition 0aAdditive 0aPhenol 0aInteraction 0aHydrophilic matrix 0aCarrier material1 aPygall, Samuel R.1 aBajwa, Gurjit S.1 aDoughty, Stephen W.1 aTimmins, Peter1 aMelia, Colin D.0 tCarbohydrate polymers.g2014 Jan. 30, v. 101 p.1198-1204dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl47819x0144-86177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbpol.2013.10.0613Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02694naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002000153245012700173520133200300592002801632650001001660650001601670650001001686650001601696650002101712650001801733650001401751650001701765650001901782650001701801650001301818651001001831653002701841653001201868653002301880653001601903700001601919700001601935700001201951700001601963700001501979700001501994773011802009856008802127852000902215655001202224IND60722749220221121094858.0220103e20210510xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072274922DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.1444842doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Xiangnan10aNeglected microplastics pollution in the nearshore surface waters derived from coastal fishery activities in Weihai, China  aPlastic fishing gears have been widely used in marine fishing and mariculture, which could cause serious microplastics pollution but receive little attention. To further figure out the effect of fishery activities on microplastics, the occurrence and sources of microplastics contamination in the nearshore surface seawater of Weihai (a coastal fishery city of China) were studied. All the collected microplastics were sorted and counted based on their size, shape, and color. The distribution of microplastics pollution in this study areas was mapped. The results showed that the mean concentration of all sampling sites was 5.9±3.5 particles/m³; the concentration in the mariculture areas was 11.49 particles/m³, much higher than that in other areas without mariculture 1.57 particles/m³. Fragment and fiber accounted for 45.4% and 28.2% of the total microplastics, respectively. Most fibers and fragments were identified as polyethylene (PE) and polypropylene (PP), mainly originated from the fishing nets/ropes. Polystyrene (PS) was also generally detected in the samples due to the foam floating balls used in the mariculture area. Our research strongly suggested that marine fishery activities, especially for mariculture, could be an underestimated sea-based microplastics source and more attentions should be given.  aPublisher supplied data 3acolor 3aenvironment 3afoams 3amariculture 3amarine fisheries 3amicroplastics 3apollution 3apolyethylene 3apolypropylenes 3apolystyrenes 3aseawater 3aChina 0aMicroplastic pollution 0aSources 0aFishery activities 0aMariculture1 aLi, Shuqian1 aLiu, Yuning1 aYu, Kai1 aZhang, Hong1 aYu, Haibin1 aJiang, Jie0 tScience of the total environment.g2021 May 10, v. 768 p.144484-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.1444843Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02496naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002500151245012500176300001300301500001900314520125100333592002801584650002001612650001301632650001101645650001101656650001501667650001101682650001401693650001701707650001401724653003701738653002601775653002901801700002801830700002001858773012601878856008502004852000902089655001202098IND60725454920221117203837.0210125e20210102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072545492DNAL7 a10.1080/09715010.2018.15055612doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSingh, Prateek Kumar10aFlow resistance in straight gravel bed inbank flow with analytical solution for velocity and boundary shear distribution  ap. 9-22.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aIn the present investigation, the roughness characteristics of the gravel bed is tested and modelled for the no-load condition. A straight trapezoidal channel having gravel bed surface of grain size D₅₀ as 13.5 mm for no-load condition is used to carry out the investigation. Depth averaged velocity (DAV) and boundary shear stress (BSS) have been measured for five different depths. An improved model for prediction of friction factor is derived as the function of corresponding hydraulic radius and average diameter of the gravel. This improved model is validated with the models of past investigators. Furthermore, BSS is then calculated using Shiono and Knight Method (SKM), which is dependent on the following hydraulic parameters, such as friction factor f, coefficient of eddy viscosity λ and secondary flow term Г. Since friction factor is modelled for the given channel, same model is used to calculate the value of f over the bed, which tests the reliability of the model while using numerical method. The lateral distribution of DAV and BSS is shown for five different flow depths, which elaborate the bed friction due to the no-load condition. Finally, friction factor model is corroborated on two reaches of the natural river.  aPublisher supplied data 3aflow resistance 3afriction 3agravel 3amodels 3aprediction 3arivers 3aroughness 3ashear stress 3aviscosity 0aDarcy–Weisbach friction factor 0aboundary shear stress 0aShiono and Knight Method1 aKhatua, Kishanjit Kumar1 aBanerjee, Sumit0 tISH journal of hydraulic engineering.g2021 Jan. 02, v. 27, no. 1 p.9-22dTaylor & FranciswJournal:6329x2164-30407nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09715010.2018.15055613Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03338naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002900140245014100169300001600310520194800326592002802274650002602302650003002328650002502358650002202383650002402405650002302429650001102452650001702463650003102480650002002511650001302531653001602544653002102560653001402581653001502595700003102610700002302641773014402664856007402808961001302882852000902895655001202904IND60680455920221122221327.0200105e20170110xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068045592DNAL7 a10.1093/jee/tow2132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAthanassiou, Christos G.10aEffect of the Presence of Live or Dead Insects on Subsequent Captures of Six Stored-Product Beetle Species: The Relative Species Matters  ap. 770-775.  aIn trapping programs prior capture of individuals of the same or different species may influence subsequent attractiveness of the trap. To evaluate this process with stored-product insects, the effect of the presence of dead or alive adults in traps on the behavioral responses of six stored-product insect species, Tribolium confusum Jacquelin du Val, T. castaneum (Herbst) (Coleoptera: Tenebrionidae), Sitophilus oryzae (L.), S. granarius (L.) (Coleoptera: Curculionidae), Oryzaephilus surinamensis (L.) and O. mercator (Fauvel) (Coleoptera: Silvanidae), was studied in choice tests under laboratory conditions. Two series of tests were carried out. In the first series, the choice was between either alive or dead adults of same species and blank (no adults). Overall, dead adults had the strongest influence, increasing the response of S. oryzae, S. granarius, O. surinamensis, and O. mercator and decreasing the response of the two Tribolium species. Presence of alive adults generally did not result in a response different from blank, except for T. castaneum and O. surinamensis that had a reduced response. In the second series of tests, the choice was between alive or dead individuals of the species vs. alive or dead individuals of its relative cogeneric species. For choices between alive individuals, S. oryzae, S. granarius, and O. surinamensis showed a preference for alive individuals of the same species vs. the cogeneric species, and for all the other species there was no preference. For choices between dead individuals, T. castaneum exhibited a preference for individuals of the same species, while S. oryzae, S. granarius, and O. mercator showed a preference for individuals of the cogeneric species, and all other combinations did exhibit a preference. Our results suggest that traps containing alive and dead individuals of the same and other species can seriously affect the response and capture of additional insects.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOryzaephilus mercator 3aOryzaephilus surinamensis 3aSitophilus granarius 3aSitophilus oryzae 3aTribolium castaneum 3aTribolium confusum 3aadults 3ainsect traps 3alaboratory experimentation 3astorage insects 3atrapping 0achoice test 0aprevious capture 0aTribolium 0aSitophilus1 aKavallieratos, Nickolas G.1 aCampbell, James F.0 tJournal of economic entomology.g2017 Jan. 10, v. 110, no. 2 p.770-775dentomological society of americawJournal:jnl46276x0022-04937nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jee/tow2133Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/ARS  aDNAL 7aarticle02040naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001200151245013800163300001400301520074100315592002801056650001501084650002201099650004301121650001901164650001501183650002701198650001301225650001401238653002601252653002701278653002101305653002601326653001201352700001901364700001501383700002001398700001901418773008701437856008501524852000901609655001201618IND60599399220221119210614.0180702e201403  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059939922DNAL7 a10.1016/j.talanta.2013.11.0792doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLuo, Xi10aGraphene nanoplatelets as a highly efficient solid-phase extraction sorbent for determination of phthalate esters in aqueous solution  ap. 71-75.  aGraphene nanoplatelet (GN) as a solid-phase extraction (SPE) sorbent in combination with high performance liquid chromatography has been used for the determination of five phthalate esters (PAEs) in aqueous solution.

As such, achieving highly efficient conversion of CO₂ to value-added fuels using renewable energy has been extensively studied in order to achieve net carbon emission and reduce our dependence on fossil fuels. Among the various CO₂ conversion approaches, methanation of CO₂ through hydrogenation, giving the generation of artificial CH₄, has attracted lots of interest from both the research community and industry since CH₄ can be further used as a chemical feedstock to produce highly value-added chemical products and act as an efficient medium to store energy in high-energy bonds for storage and transportation. Thermal catalytic CO₂ methanation has been utilized commercially on a large scale, while its high energy consumption and harsh reaction conditions suggest that using renewable energy to promote the reaction in a milder way is a more promising strategy. Currently, photopromoted catalytic methanation of CO₂ has been extensively reported, especially in the aspects of catalyst design, reactor design, and mechanism research, as this technology can be easily integrated into the currently running Sabatier reaction systems in industry. Nevertheless, comprehensive reviews of photopromoted CO₂ methanation through hydrogenation are still lacking, which we believe is very important for the future design of efficient catalysts and reaction systems for this reaction. Herein, we first show the significance of the Sabatier reaction and briefly introduce the current commercial thermal catalytic reaction systems. By prescreening this, we know that the high consumption of fossil fuels and safety concerns drive us to turn attention to photopromoted catalysis. As such, second, the research progress including catalysts development and mechanism investigations for photopromoted CO₂ methanation is highlighted. Last but not least, we describe the crucial challenges at the current stage and propose future prospects for photopromoted CO₂ hydrogenation technologies. We hope the readers can gain basic knowledge on this topic and obtain theoretical guidance for the future design of efficient catalytic systems for the photopromoted Sabatier reaction to meet the growing need for artificial methane production.  aPublisher supplied data  a21902085cNational Natural Science Foundation of Chinadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100001809  a51572157cNational Natural Science Foundation of Chinadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100001809  aJCYJ20190807093205660cShenzhen Fundamental Research Programdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100017607 3acarbon 3acarbon dioxide 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3aenergy 3afeedstocks 3ahydrogenation 3aindustry 3amethane production 3atransportation 3avalue added1 aYang, Zhengyi1 aTang, Yunxiang1 aLiu, Jiurong1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3180-002X1 aWang, Fenglong1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9834-98490 tEnergy & fuels.g2022 June 21, v. 36, no. 13 p.6711-6735dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23338x1520-50297nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.energyfuels.2c015073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02214naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002500151245010900176300001400285500001900299520103000318592002801348650001201376650002201388650001101410650002401421650001701445653002201462653002601484653002701510700002001537700001801557700001601575700002801591773012701619856008501746852000901831655001201840IND60725455020221117204023.0210125e20210102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072545502DNAL7 a10.1080/09715010.2018.15055622doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSingh, Prateek Kumar10aLateral distribution of depth average velocity & boundary shear stress in a gravel bed open channel flow  ap. 23-37.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aGravel bed flow is so generic condition that its study becomes fascinating as well as critical to apprehend flow characteristic.

Furthermore, the distribution of streamwise depth-averaged velocity and boundary shear stress at different flow depths of gravel bed are also calculated using different hydraulic software packages such as CES & ANSYS FLUENT. These numerical simulation results have shown reasonably good agreement with experimental data over main channel in inbank flow. Finally, results obtained are corroborated through error analysis.

To identify various homologues in the matrix of medicinal plant samples, a method for simultaneous determination was developed using ESI(+)-LC-MS3. A complete separation of each homologue was achieved within 20 min using a PFP column and an isocratic elution system of water/methanol (10:90, v/v) at a flow rate of 0.5 mL/min. The ESI-MS condition for each homologue was optimized, and the m/z value and the fragmentation pathway of each homologue were summarized. This LC-MS3 method made it possible to detect the homologues without the effect of matrix; therefore, high sensitive analysis was established, and then, the MS3 makes it possible to extract from plants with methanol only. The LC-MS3 method was applied to identify the eight vitamin E homologues in 11 medicinal plants.  aPublisher supplied data 3amedicinal plants 3amethanol 3avitamin E 0aESI(+)-LC-MS3 0asimultaneous analysis 0atocopherol 0atocotrienol 0afragmentation pattern 0amatrix effect1 aTatemori, Satoko1 aMuranaka, Natsumi1 aHirahara, Yoshichika1 aHomma, Seiichi1 aNakane, Takahisa1 aTakano, Akihito1 aNomi, Yuri1 aOtsuka, Yuzuru0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2012 Sept. 26, v. 60, no. 38 p.9581-9588dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-51187nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fjf302425z3Available from publisher's site 7aarticle03009naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100002700141245010100168300001600269520164600285592002801931650001001959650002501969650001901994650001102013650001802024650001402042650001202056650001402068650001502082650001602097650002502113650001702138650001502155650001302170650001002183650001902193653002002212653002402232700003002256700005902286773012202345856007502467852000902542655001202551IND60682081120221118044913.0200124e20190712xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068208112DNAL7 a10.1017/wet.2019.512doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZangoueinejad, Rouzbeh10aEvaluation of auxin tolerance in selected tomato germplasm under greenhouse and field conditions  ap. 815-822.  aTomato is injured by low doses of 2,4-D, dicamba, quinclorac, and glyphosate. New crop varieties resistant to 2,4-D and dicamba are likely to increase use of these herbicides and may increase drift problems. There is a diverse germplasm of tomato available that includes wild relatives known to be tolerant to numerous biotic and abiotic stresses. A greenhouse and field study was conducted to investigate auxin tolerance in three wild tomato accessions (TOM199, TOM198, and TOM300) and compare them with two commercial tomato cultivars (‘Money Maker' and ‘Better Boy'). Auxin herbicides, which included 2,4-D, dicamba, and quinclorac, were applied at doses of 11, 3, and 39 g ae ha–¹, respectively. Visible injury ratings of each accession for each herbicide treatment were recorded at 7, 14, 21, and 28 d after treatment (DAT) on a 0% to 100% scale. Results indicate that all three wild tomato accessions exhibited less than 15% injury compared with 100% injury for two commercial cultivars after application of dicamba. The three wild accessions (TOM199, TOM198, and TOM300) did not show any significant reduction in plant height compared with nontreated plants. At 28 DAT, plant heights of TOM199, TOM198, and TOM300 were 25, 25, and 28 cm when treated with dicamba and 31, 30, and 31 cm nontreated, respectively. Based on these results, the identified lines can serve as a genetic resource for developing herbicide-tolerant tomato, thus minimizing or eliminating the negative impacts of drift from nonlabeled herbicides tested in this project.

We characterized three virulent bacteriophages, Bastille, W.Ph. and CP-51, that infect various strains of these three species. We have determined the complete genome sequences of CP-51, W.Ph. and Bastille, and their physical genome structures. The CP-51 genome sequence could only be obtained using a combination of conventional and second and third next generation sequencing technologies – illustrating the problems associated with sequencing highly modified DNA. We present evidence that the generalized transduction facilitated by CP-51 is independent of a specific genome structure, but likely due to sporadic packaging errors of the terminase. There is clear correlation of the genetic and morphological features of these phages validating their placement in the Spounavirinae subfamily (SPO1-related phages) of the Myoviridae. This study also provides tools for the development of phage-based diagnostics/therapeutics for this group of pathogens.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aMyoviridae 3abacteriophages 3adiagnostic techniques 3agenome 3ahigh-throughput nucleotide sequencing 3anucleotide sequences 3apathogens 3atherapeutics 3avirulence 0aSpounavirinae 0aGenome sequencing 0aTransduction 0aBiocontrol 0aHybrid sequencing1 aSchmuki, Martina1 aSozhamannan, Shanmuga1 aBeyer, Wolfgang1 aFouts, Derrick E.1 aBernbach, Vanessa1 aCalendar, Richard1 aLoessner, Martin J.0 tVirology.g2014 Aug., v. 462-463 p.299-308dElsevier Inc.aElsevier Inc.wJournal:2802x0042-68227nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.virol.2014.06.0123Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03642naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005600148245014600204300001600350500001400366520168700380592002802067596005802095596005902153596005902212596005802271596006402329650001302393650002302406650000902429650003102438650001102469650001702480650001802497650000902515650001102524650002102535650001302556650001402569650001002583650001202593650003402605650001302639650001302652650002302665650001402688650001202702700001502714700001802729700001902747700001602766700001702782700001402799773013602813856008202949852000903031655001203040IND60705284020221119231446.0200803e202009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070528402DNAL7 a10.1007/s13562-020-00570-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShi, Fenghua1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8351-452X10aApplication of the phosphomannose-isomerase/mannose selection system in the Agrobacterium-mediated transformation of Lonicera hypoglauca Miq.  ap. 528-538.  aNAL-light  aThe dried buds of Lonicera hypoglauca Miq. have antipyretic, antidotal and anti-inflammatory properties and as Flos lonicerae are widely used in Chinese patent medicine. Because of its medicinal value, there is a need to establish its transformation system in order to study the biosynthesis pathway of its active substances. The phosphomannose isomerase (PMI) gene is probably the most effective selection maker for the transformation system of plants. To establish PMI selection system for transformation of L. hypoglauca, explants were cultured on the induction medium (MS + 0.1 mg/L NAA + 1.0 mg/L 6-BA + 6 g/L agar) supplemented with different ratios of mannose and sucrose, and data on callus formation were collected. After the concentration of mannose and sucrose was determined, 172 leaf explants, 61 leafstalks and 53 stem segment explants were infected with Agrobactrium containing pCAMBIA1301-PMI. The putatively transformed calluses induced from these explants were detected by PCR, RT-PCR and chlorophenol red assay (CPR). We found that callus formation was effectively suppressed on the induction medium supplemented with mannose. The appropriate concentration of mannose and sucrose in the selection medium was 8 g/L and 22 g/L, under which the transformation frequency of leaf from L. hypoglauca was 15.96%. CPR assay for callus induced from leafstalk and stem have a moderate false negative rate when RT-PCR used as criterion. Taken together, it was concluded that PMI/mannose selection system could be used in the transformation of L. hypoglauca, and CPR assay might be suited for the preliminary screening of the transformation of L. hypoglauca.  aPublisher supplied data  a3126035cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a31760422cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a31200305cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a2012GXNSFDA053019cGuangxi Natural Science Foundation  aGuikeAD16380013cTechnology Base and Talent Special Project 3aLonicera 3aactive ingredients 3aagar 3aanti-inflammatory activity 3aassays 3abiosynthesis 3abiotechnology 3abuds 3acallus 3acallus formation 3aexplants 3afrequency 3agenes 3amannose 3amannose-6-phosphate isomerase 3amedicine 3apetioles 3aplant biochemistry 3ascreening 3asucrose1 aTan, Muxiu1 aMo, Qiaocheng1 aChen, Xiaoying1 aZhao, Yimin1 aGuo, Xiaoyun1 aJiang, Ni0 tJournal of plant biochemistry and biotechnology.g2020 Sept., v. 29, no. 3 p.528-538dSpringer IndiawJournal:2089x0971-78117nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13562-020-00570-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03414naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100003200140245012500172300001300297520177000310592002802080650001802108650002302126650002302149650001102172650000902183650002602192650001402218650001702232650002102249650002302270650001602293650001502309650001702324650001202341650001402353650002002367650001302387650003102400650001702431650002602448650001502474650002802489650001902517650001302536650002002549653002302569653002402592700002002616773014102636856007402777852000902851655001202860IND60680456220221122152313.0200105e20191231xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068045622DNAL7 a10.1093/jee/tow2192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchmidt-Jeffris, Rebecca A.10aAnthranilic Diamide Insecticides Delivered via Multiple Approaches to Control Vegetable Pests: A Case Study in Snap Bean  ap. 1-10.  aMany vegetable insect pests are managed using neonicotinoid and pyrethroid insecticides. Unfortunately, these insecticides are toxic to many bees and natural enemies and no longer control some pests that have developed resistance. Anthranilic diamide insecticides provide systemic control of many herbivorous arthropod pests, but exhibit low toxicity to beneficial arthropods and mammals, and may be a promising alternative to neonicotinoids and pyrethroids. Anthranilic diamides may be delivered to vegetable crops via seed, in-furrow, or foliar treatments; therefore, it would be desirable to identify which application method provides high levels of pest control while minimizing the amount of active ingredient. As a case study, chlorantraniliprole and cyantraniliprole applied via the methods listed above were evaluated for managing seedcorn maggot, Delia platura (Meigen) (Diptera: Anthomyiidae), and European corn borer, Ostrinia nubilalis (Hübner) (Lepidoptera: Crambidae), in snap bean. Chlorantraniliprole and cyantraniliprole delivered as seed and in-furrow treatments reduced D. platura damage to the same level as the standard neonicotinoid seed treatment. Both diamides applied via all three methods significantly reduced O. nubilalis damage, but only the foliar application provided similar control as the standard pyrethroid spray. Results from laboratory bioassays revealed that both diamides applied as seed and in-furrow treatments caused high O. nubilalis neonate mortality up to 44 d after application. While the diamides provided equivalent control of these pests as the neonicotinoid and pyrethroid standards when applied in the same manner, chlorantraniliprole delivered as a seed treatment showed the most promise for managing both pests.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDelia platura 3aOstrinia nubilalis 3aactive ingredients 3aamides 3abees 3abeneficial arthropods 3abioassays 3acase studies 3acyantraniliprole 3afoliar application 3agreen beans 3aherbivores 3ainsect pests 3amammals 3amortality 3anatural enemies 3aneonates 3aneonicotinoid insecticides 3apest control 3apesticide application 3apyrethrins 3apyrethroid insecticides 3aseed treatment 3atoxicity 3avegetable crops 0aPhaseolus vulgaris 0achlorantraniliprole1 aNault, Brian A.0 tJournal of economic entomology.g2019 Dec. 31, v. 109, no. 6 p.1-10dEntomological Society of AmericawJournal:jnl46276x0022-04937nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jee/tow2193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03254naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100007300148245014600221300001600367500001400383520166800397592002802065650002002093650001202113650001802125650002202143650001402165650001402179650002102193650002002214650002202234650001302256650001402269650001602283650000902299650001402308650002302322650002502345650001502370650001302385650001502398651001102413700007802424700003102502773013602533856008202669852000902751655001202760IND60705284120221119231638.0200803e202009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070528412DNAL7 a10.1007/s13562-019-00532-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aValadez Moctezuma, Ernestina,1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8765-661310aGenetic variability and population structure of Mexican chickpea (Cicer arietinum L.) germplasm accessions revealed by microsatellite markers  ap. 357-367.  aNAL-light  aGlobally, the chickpea is the second most important dried grain legume after bean. Mexico occupies eighth place as producer and fourth as exporter of this legume. The cultivated genotypes are selected from advanced lines obtained from breeding programs, whose main genetic materials have come from international germplasm centers. Despite the limited number of chickpea cultivars in Mexico, there are no scientific reports on its molecular characterization and genetic variability and structure. Therefore, the present research was carried out to estimate the genetic variability of the main cultivars developed in Mexico, and others donated by International Centers (ICARDA and ICRISAT). With the analysis of ten SSR markers, a total of 51 alleles were obtained, with individual values ranging from 3 to 9 alleles per locus. The average value of PIC was estimated at 0.70, while the average value of Shannon's Information Index was 1.365, indicating the presence of a high level of genetic variability in the collection. The UPGMA and PCoA analysis showed the trend of separation of the Mexican genotypes from those of ICARDA and ICRISAT. The genetic distance was close (0.292) between the ICARDA and ICRISAT groups, while a greater distance (0.718) was obtained between the ICARDA and Mexican groups. In conclusion, the present work revealed that the most of the Mexican cultivars were grouped together and diverged from the other accessions revealing a distinct genetic nature. The accessions from ICARDA and ICRISAT did not strictly follow the grouping according to their geographical origins, maybe because the exchange of germplasm between research centers.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCicer arietinum 3aalleles 3abiotechnology 3abreeding programs 3achickpeas 3acultivars 3agenetic distance 3agenetic markers 3agenetic variation 3agenotype 3agermplasm 3ainformation 3aloci 3amaterials 3aplant biochemistry 3apopulation structure 3aprovenance 3aresearch 3aseparation 3aMexico1 aCabrera-Hidalgo, Anselmo de Jesús1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9644-00751 aArreguin-Espinosa, Roberto0 tJournal of plant biochemistry and biotechnology.g2020 Sept., v. 29, no. 3 p.357-367dSpringer IndiawJournal:2089x0971-78117nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13562-019-00532-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03502naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004400094040001800138100006100156245017200217500001900389520192000408592002802328650002102356650002802377650001002405650001102415650001102426650001302437650002302450650001202473650001302485653001502498653001802513653001802531653002102549653001902570653001502589653002502604700005902629700005702688700001802745700001602763700006002779773009302839856009102932852000903023655001203032IND60704762420221116193539.0201023e202011  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070476242DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biomaterials.2020.1201632doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAgrahari, Vibhuti1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1884-164410aIntelligent micro-/nanorobots as drug and cell carrier devices for biomedical therapeutic advancement: Promising development opportunities and translational challenges  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aNanotechnology and microfabrication approaches are playing instrumental roles in the development of innovative technologies to fight human diseases. Because of promising in vitro and preclinical outcomes, micro-/nanorobots (MNRs), are increasingly being considered for personalized and precision therapeutic diagnoses, sensing, drug delivery, and surgery. Today, designing MNR-based devices to improve the safety and efficacy of drugs for targeted cells and tissues represents a novel and promising area of therapeutic development. Progress has primarily been due to many scientific breakthroughs made in design, fabrication, and operational technologies, which greatly enhanced the capabilities of MNRs to meet the requirements of biomedical applications. This review focuses on the development and emerging biomedical applications of micro-/nanostructures encompassing nanoswimmers, nanoengines, 3D-motion nanomachines, and biologically inspired microbots, nanofish, nanorockets, etc. Promising applications of these novel devices in various therapeutic areas are discussed. We examine the impacts of the rapid progress made in developing these novel devices for drug delivery applications. We also summarize the current fabrication, scale-up development and clinical translational challenges and the main roadblocks that need to be overcome, particularly those related to patient safety and personalized medicine approaches, areas that require the design of safe innovative materials. As MNRs are new, scientists should systematically investigate their behavior, functionality, biocompatibility, toxicity, biodistribution, and efficacy before considering any potential clinical evaluations, while also ensuing that they comply with ethical principles. Although still an emerging area, MNRs are steadily becoming a realistic prospect as vital future therapeutic tools for a vast array of biomedical applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiocompatibility 3abiocompatible materials 3adrugs 3aethics 3ahumans 3apatients 3aprecision medicine 3asurgery 3atoxicity 0aNanorobots 0aDrug delivery 0aCell delivery 0aMicrofabrication 0aNanotechnology 0aNanomotors 0aClinical translation1 aAgrahari, Vivek1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3837-17771 aChou, Ming-Li1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6996-53321 aChew, Chew Ho1 aNoll, James1 aBurnouf, Thierry1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0507-92430 tBiomaterials.g2020 Nov., v. 260 p.120163-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11782x0142-96127nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biomaterials.2020.1201633Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02949naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002300148245012800171300001600299500001400315520137100329592002801700650002201728650002101750650002301771650001301794650002901807650002901836650001601865650001101881650002401892650001801916650001501934650001401949650001801963650001301981650004101994650001102035650001302046650001902059650002802078650002302106650001002129650001402139650003002153700002102183773013602204856008202340852000902422655001202431IND60705284220221119231437.0200803e202009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070528422DNAL7 a10.1007/s13562-020-00572-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKharnaior, Suklang10aPreliminary screening of Houttuynia cordata for biological potential and chemical components using TLC and GC–MS analysis  ap. 539-552.  aNAL-light  aThe objective of the study is to ascertain the biological potential and to identify the bioactive compounds of the four crude extract hexane, chloroform, ethyl acetate, and methanol from the roots of Houttuynia cordata. The chemical compounds of the extracts have analyzed by Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GC–MS) and Thin Layer Chromatography.

The thermophoretic deposition efficiencies under varying Reynolds (Re) numbers and temperature differences are obtained from the direct numerical simulation of the submicron particle flowing around the droplet. Comparison of the results calculated under the same conditions through the classical thermophoretic deposition efficiency formula and by numerical simulation shows that the Davenport formula always returns greater values than the numerical simulation, by a relative deviation of 19.8%–63.8%. The relative deviation decreased first and then increased with increasing difference in temperature, and increased gradually with increasing Re. The deviation resulted from the assumption that the particle concentration on the droplet surface is equal to that of the incoming flow in the formula deduction process. The convection of the gas and the thermophoresis of the particles together determined the migration of the particles in the boundary layer, and so determined the particle concentration distribution on the surface of droplets. Thus, the particle concentrations on the surface of droplets are actually lower than those of the incoming flow and are distributed bimodally on the surface. The dimensionless particle concentration on the surface of droplets decreased with increasing Re, and increased first then decreased later with increasing difference in temperature. The dimensionless thermophoretic driving velocity and Re were adopted to correct the formula. The results calculated by the corrected formula were consistent with the numerical simulation employed in this paper, such that the maximum relative deviation was reduced from the original 66.8% to less than 8%.  aPublisher supplied data 3aatmospheric chemistry 3aconvection 3adroplets 3amathematical models 3atemperature 0aParticulate matter 0aDroplet 0aThermophoresis 0aDeposition efficiency1 aSong, Qiang1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5484-35941 aYao, Qiang0 tAtmospheric environment.g2016 Dec., v. 147 p.157-165dElsevier LtdwJournal:12031x1352-23107nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.atmosenv.2016.10.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02091naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001700140245012500157300002000282520088700302592002801189650001101217650001101228650002801239650002201267650001501289650001101304650001201315700001701327700001901344700001601363700001301379700001501392700001701407700001301424700001801437700001901455773012401474856007401598852000901672655001201681IND60675739120221121173115.0191108e20191101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067573912DNAL7 a10.1039/c9ra06576h2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLin, Yangfan10aStructure and conductivity enhanced treble-shelled porous silicon as an anode for high-performance lithium-ion batteries  ap. 35392-35400.  aSilicon is regarded as the next generation anode material for lithium-ion batteries because of its high specific capacity, low intercalation potential and abundant reserves. However, huge volume changes during the lithiation and delithiation processes and low electrical conductivity obstruct the practical applications of silicon anodes. In this study, a treble-shelled porous silicon (TS-P-Si) structure was synthesized via a three-step approach. The TS-P-Si anode delivered a capacity of 858.94 mA h g⁻¹ and a capacity retention of 87.8% (753.99 mA h g⁻¹) after being subjected to 400 cycles at a current density of 400 mA g⁻¹. The good cycling performance was due to the unique structure of the inner silicon oxide layer, middle silver nano-particle layer and outer carbon layer, leading to a good conductivity and a decreased volume change of this silicon-based anode.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanodes 3acarbon 3aelectrical conductivity 3alithium batteries 3ananosilver 3asilica 3asilicon1 aLin, Hanqing1 aJiang, Jingwei1 aYang, Deren1 aDu, Ning1 aHe, Xueqin1 aRen, Jianguo1 aHe, Peng1 aPang, Chunlei1 aXiao, Chengmao0 tRSC advances.g2019 Nov. 01, v. 9, no. 61 p.35392-35400dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c9ra06576h3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03070naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100003300147245021500180520168100395592002802076650002702104650001602131650001202147650001502159650001002174650002202184650000902206650001402215650003102229650001402260650002002274650002002294650001002314651001102324700002702335700002202362700002602384700002302410773012402433856008202557852000902639655001202648IND60757891220221120175031.0211125e20211022xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075789122DNAL7 a10.3390/pathogens101113682doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShedleur-Bourguignon, Fanie 10aUse of an Ecosystem-Based Approach to Shed Light on the Heterogeneity of the Contamination Pattern of Listeria monocytogenes on Conveyor Belt Surfaces in a Swine Slaughterhouse in the Province of Quebec, Canada  aThe role of the accompanying microbiota in the presence of Listeria monocytogenes on meat processing surfaces is not yet understood, especially in industrial production conditions. In this study, 300 conveyor belt samples from the cutting room of a swine slaughterhouse were collected during production. The samples were subjected to the detection of L. monocytogenes. Recovered strains were characterized by serogrouping-PCR, InlA Sanger sequencing and for their ability to form biofilm. A selection of isolates was compared with core genome multi-locus sequence typing analysis (cgMLST). The sequencing of the V4 region of the 16S RNA gene of the microorganisms harvested from each sample was carried out in parallel using the Illumina MiSeq platform. Diversity analyses were performed and MaAsLin analysis was used to assess the link between L. monocytogenes detection and the surrounding bacteria. The 72 isolates collected showed a low genetic diversity and important persistence characteristics. L. monocytogenes isolates were not stochastically distributed on the surfaces: the isolates were detected on three out of six production lines, each associated with a specific meat cut: the half carcasses, the bostons and the picnics. MaAsLin biomarker analysis identified the taxa Veillonella (p ≤ 0.0397) as a bacterial determinant of the presence of L. monocytogenes on processing surfaces. The results of this study revealed a heterogenous contamination pattern of the processing surfaces by L. monocytogenes and targeted a bacterial indicator of the presence of the pathogen. These results could lead to a better risk assessment of the contamination of meat products.  aPublisher supplied data 3aListeria monocytogenes 3aVeillonella 3abiofilm 3abiomarkers 3agenes 3agenetic variation 3ameat 3ameat cuts 3amultilocus sequence typing 3apathogens 3arisk assessment 3aslaughterhouses 3aswine 3aQuebec1 aThériault, William P.1 aLongpré, Jessie 1 aThibodeau, Alexandre 1 aFravalo, Philippe 0 tPathogens.g2021 Oct. 22, v. 10, no. 11dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27146x2076-08177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/pathogens101113683Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01966naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100002200188245012000210300001600330520100500346592002801351653001501379653002501394653002201419653001401441653002301455653000901478773007301487856008301560852000901643655001201652IND60124565120221123003119.0151025e201103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012456512DNAL7 a10.1007/s13280-010-0128-y2doi7 aPMC33577852pmcid7 a214463952pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHassler, Bjöörn10aAccidental Versus Operational Oil Spills from Shipping in the Baltic Sea: Risk Governance and Management Strategies  ap. 170-178.  aMarine governance of oil transportation is complex. Due to difficulties in effectively monitoring procedures on vessels en voyage, incentives to save costs by not following established regulations on issues such as cleaning of tanks, crew size, and safe navigation may be substantial. The issue of problem structure is placed in focus, that is, to what degree the specific characteristics and complexity of intentional versus accidental oil spill risks affect institutional responses. It is shown that whereas the risk of accidental oil spills primarily has been met by technical requirements on the vessels in combination with Port State control, attempts have been made to curb intentional pollution by for example increased surveillance and smart governance mechanisms such as the No-Special-Fee system. It is suggested that environmental safety could be improved by increased use of smart governance mechanisms tightly adapted to key actors' incentives to alter behavior in preferable directions.  aPublisher supplied data 0aBaltic Sea 0aEnvironmental hazard 0aMarine governance 0aOil spill 0aOil transportation 0aRisk0 tAmbio.g2011 Mar., v. 40, no. 2 p.170-178dSpringerx0044-74477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007%2Fs13280-010-0128-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02786naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245013700163300001600300520135800316592002801674650001601702650001201718650003101730650001301761650000901774650001101783650002301794650001801817650002701835650001101862650001301873650001401886650001901900653002301919653000901942653001301951653001101964700005301975700001802028700001402046700001702060700001602077773012102093856008102214852000902295655001202304IND60632813120221120201658.0190318e201807  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063281312DNAL7 a10.1016/j.lwt.2018.03.0722doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Lingjin10aSynergistic effect of sodium dodecyl sulfate and salts on the gelation properties of acid-hydrolyzed-hydroxypropylated potato starch  ap. 556-562.  aAppropriate modifications of starch are necessary to meet the industrial demand for high-quality hard capsule materials as an alternative to gelatin. In the present study, the influence of sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) and salts on the gelation properties of acid-hydrolyzed-hydroxypropylated potato starch (AHP) was characterized using dynamic rheological tests. A significant phenomenon was discovered in terms of a synergistic effect between SDS and salts, and was further explored using blue-value and zeta-potential analyses. In particular, the gelation temperature of the AHP pastes increased with increasing concentrations of KCl until there was not enough SDS available to achieve a cooperative effect. Formation of a starch-SDS inclusion complex led to a weakened combination of starch-iodine, and increased the surface charge of starch molecules. Moreover, a decrease in zeta-potential value was observed along with the addition of KCl. Considering the charged sulfate groups of complex starch-SDS, which was provided by SDS, were similar to that of carrageenan, we put forward a hypothesis that the observed synergistic effect of SDS and salts is mainly attributed to the electronic interactions between salt ions. The current study provides a necessary strategy for applying AHP as a gelatin alternative in the manufacturing of hard capsules.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarrageenan 3agelatin 3agelatinization temperature 3agelation 3aions 3apastes 3apotassium chloride 3apotato starch 3asodium dodecyl sulfate 3astarch 3asulfates 3asynergism 3azeta potential 0aSynergistic effect 0aSalt 0aGelation 0aStarch1 aHong, Yan1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8206-905X1 aGu, Zhengbiao1 aCheng, Li1 aLi, Zhaofeng1 aLi, Caiming0 tLebensmittel-Wissenschaft + Technologie.g2018 July, v. 93 p.556-562dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl1644x0023-64387nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lwt.2018.03.0723Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03844naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024003500135040001800170100002600188245019100214300001200405506007600417520195200493592002802445596002502473596002402498506003702522650003002559650002602589650001002615650002502625650001402650650001002664650001302674650001702687650002802704650001102732650002502743650002102768650001102789650001002800650002002810650002102830650001102851650001402862650001902876700003002895700003202925700003502957700002802992700002403020773013103044856008203175852000903257655001203266IND60660418620221207094946.0201028e201912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066041862DNAL7 a314389472pmid7 aPMC67044962pmcid7 a10.1186/s12906-019-2591-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 ada Silva, Caio Mateus10aCellular and molecular effects of Baccharis dracunculifolia D.C. and Plectranthus barbatus Andrews medicinal plant extracts on retinoid metabolism in the human hepatic stellate cell LX-2  ap. 222.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: Chronic hepatic diseases are serious problems worldwide, which may lead to the development of fibrosis and eventually cirrhosis. Despite the significant number of people affected by hepatic fibrosis, no effective treatment is available. In the liver, hepatic stellate cells are the major fibrogenic cell type that play a relevant function in chronic liver diseases. Thus, the characterization of components that control the fibrogenesis in the hepatic stellate cells is relevant in supporting the development of innovative therapies to treat and/or control liver fibrosis. The present study investigated the effects of Baccharis dracunculifolia D.C. and Plectranthus barbatus Andrews medicinal plant extracts in LX-2 transdifferentiation. METHODS: LX-2 is a human immortalized hepatic stellate cell that can transdifferentiate in vitro from a quiescent-like phenotype to a more proliferative and activated behavior, and it provides a useful platform to assess antifibrotic drugs. Then, the antifibrotic effects of hydroalcoholic extracts of Baccharis dracunculifolia and Plectranthus barbatus medicinal plants on LX-2 were evaluated. RESULTS: The results in our cellular analyses, under the investigated concentrations of the plant extracts, indicate no deleterious effects on LX-2 metabolism, such as toxicity, genotoxicity, or apoptosis. Moreover, the extracts induced changes in actin filament distribution of activated LX-2, despite not affecting the cellular markers of transdifferentiation. Consistent effects in cellular retinoid metabolism were observed, supporting the presumed activity of the plant extracts in hepatic lipids metabolism, which corroborated the traditional knowledge about their uses for liver dysfunction. CONCLUSION: The combined results suggested a potential hepatoprotective effect of the investigated plant extracts reinforcing their safe use as coadjuvants in treating imbalanced liver lipid metabolism.  aPublisher supplied data  a2013/21186-5cFAPESP  a474060/2012-8cCNPq0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aBaccharis dracunculifolia 3aPlectranthus barbatus 3aactin 3aalternative medicine 3aapoptosis 3adrugs 3afibrosis 3agenotoxicity 3ahepatoprotective effect 3ahumans 3aindigenous knowledge 3alipid metabolism 3alipids 3aliver 3aliver cirrhosis 3amedicinal plants 3apeople 3aphenotype 3aplant extracts1 aCaetano, Flávio Henrique1 aPereira, Franco Dani Campos1 aMorales, Maria Aparecida Marin1 aSakane, Kumiko Koibuchi1 aMoraes, Karen C.

Coffee pulp is 29% of the dry weight of coffee cherries and contains caffeine, chlorogenic acid, trigonelline, diterpenes and fibre. We investigated the attenuation of signs of metabolic syndrome induced by high-carbohydrate, high-fat diet in rats by dietary supplementation with 5% freeze-dried coffee pulp for the final 8 weeks of a 16-week protocol. Coffee pulp decreased body weight, feed efficiency and abdominal fat; normalised systolic blood pressure, left ventricular diastolic stiffness, and plasma concentrations of triglycerides and non-esterified fatty acids; and improved glucose tolerance in rats fed high-carbohydrate, high-fat diet. Further, the gut microbiota was modulated with high-carbohydrate, high-fat diet and coffee pulp supplementation and 14 physiological parameters were correlated with the changes in bacterial community structures. This study suggested that coffee pulp, as a waste from the coffee industry, is useful as a functional food for improving obesity-associated metabolic, cardiovascular and liver structure and function, and gut microbiota.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabdominal fat 3abacterial communities 3abeverage industry 3abody weight 3abyproducts 3acaffeine 3achlorogenic acid 3acoffee pulp 3adietary supplements 3aditerpenoids 3afeed conversion 3afood production 3afreeze drying 3afunctional foods 3aglucose tolerance 3ahigh fat diet 3aindustrial wastes 3aintestinal microorganisms 3aliver 3ametabolic syndrome 3araw materials 3asystolic blood pressure 3atrigonelline1 aMouatt, Peter 1 aMajzoub, Marwan E.1 aThomas, Torsten 1 aBrown, Lindsay 1 aPanchal, Sunil K.0 tPathogens.g2021 Oct. 22, v. 10, no. 11dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27146x2076-08177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/pathogens101113693Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02886naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100001700112245014600129300001600275520143400291592002801725650001301753650000801766650001401774650001901788650001601807650001501823650002301838650001801861650001001879650001001889650001001899650001101909650002501920650001401945650003001959650002201989650001202011650001002023653000902033653003102042653002202073653000902095653001102104700002302115700002102138700002402159700002602183700001702209773012102226852000902347655001202356IND60128926420221122231711.0151124e201407  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012892642DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKeskin, Adem10aFirst Record of Ixodes arboricola (Ixodida: Ixodidae) From Turkey With Presence of Candidatus Rickettsia vini (Rickettsiales: Rickettsiaceae)  ap. 864-867.  aBirds are the specific hosts of many tick species and may contribute to the dissemination of ticks and tick-borne pathogens throughout the world. Determination of ticks infesting birds and their pathogens are important for the detection of natural foci of human pathogens. Unfortunately, there is very limited information about the occurrence of ticks on birds and associated pathogens in Turkey. We performed a tick survey on three passerine bird species; Parus major, Sylvia atricapilla, and Turdus merula. Ticks collected from these birds were identified to species and tested for the presence of Borrelia, Ehrlichia, and Rickettsia species. Ixodes arboricola Schulze & Schlottke, Ixodes frontalis Panzer, and Ixodes ricinus L. were found on the birds. This is the first study reporting the presence of I. frontalis and I. arboricola on S. atricapilla and P. major, respectively, in Turkey. In addition, the results of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with primers specific for gltA and ompA genes and DNA sequence analysis of positive PCR products indicated the presence of Candidatus Rickettsia vini in I. arboricola ticks. In conclusion, this is the first record of both I. arboricola and Candidatus Rickettsia vini in Turkey. Therefore, future studies needed to be conducted on the ticks infesting birds and their pathogens to elucidate the role of birds in the dispersal of tick species and tick-borne pathogens in Turkey.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBorrelia 3aDNA 3aEhrlichia 3aIxodes ricinus 3aParus major 3aRickettsia 3aSylvia atricapilla 3aTurdus merula 3abirds 3agenes 3ahosts 3ahumans 3anucleotide sequences 3apathogens 3apolymerase chain reaction 3asequence analysis 3asurveys 3aticks 0abird 0aCandidatus Rickettsia vini 0aIxodes arboricola 0atick 0aTurkey1 aKoprulu, Tugba Kul1 aBursalı, Ahmet,1 aOzsemir, Arif Cemal1 aErciyas Yavuz, Kiraz,1 aTekin, Saban0 tJournal of medical entomology.g2014 July, v. 51, no. 4 p.864-867dEntomological Society of Americax0022-25857nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle02937naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001600151245018200167520148600349592002801835650002701863650001201890650001901902650001501921650002001936650001801956650001101974650001501985650002502000650002402025650002502049653002002074653002602094653002102120653003502141700001502176700001402191700001202205700001602217700001602233700001702249773011802266856008602384852000902470655001202479IND60705561020221122005721.0210708e20201101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070556102DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jenvman.2020.1111282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLv, Junping10aHarvesting biomass of an oil-rich microalga Parachlorella kessleri TY02 by ferric chloride: Effects on harvesting efficiency, lipid production and municipal wastewater treatment  aInorganic coagulants have been widely used to harvest microalgal biomass. A great deal of attention has been mainly focused on the response of harvesting efficiency, lipid production and feasibility of the reuse of medium to inorganic coagulants. The physiological state of harvested cells and feasibility of wastewater treatment remain unclear. In this context, the effect of ferric chloride as a conventional inorganic coagulant on the harvesting efficiency, physiological state and lipid content of an oil-rich microalga Parachlorella kessleri TY02 was evaluated. Moreover, the performance of harvested cells for municipal wastewater treatment was also evaluated. When the dosage of iron ions was 0.077 mg/mg dry biomass and the sedimentation time was 5 min, the microalga had good harvesting efficiency and cell viability. As the dosage of iron ions was up to 0.15 mg/mg dry biomass, cell viability notably decreased. Cells harvested by 0.077 and 0.15 mg/mg dry biomass of iron ions showed good wastewater treatment efficiency. It was also found that long sedimentation time (40 min) not only did not promote harvesting efficiency, but also reduced cell viability. Iron ions had no notable effect on lipid content of the microalga. Through comprehensive evaluation of harvesting efficiency, lipid production, physiological state and wastewater treatment efficiency, it indicated that 0.077 mg/mg dry biomass of iron ions could be used to harvest biomass of the microalga.  aPublisher supplied data 3aParachlorella kessleri 3abiomass 3acell viability 3acoagulants 3aferric chloride 3alipid content 3alipids 3amicroalgae 3amunicipal wastewater 3aphysiological state 3awastewater treatment 0aFerric chloride 0aHarvesting efficiency 0aLipid production 0aMunicipal wastewater treatment1 aLiu, Guoji1 aFeng, Jia1 aLiu, Qi1 aNan, Fangru1 aLiu, Xudong1 aXie, Shulian0 tJournal of environmental management.g2020 Nov. 01, v. 273 p.111128-dElsevier LtdwJournal:2018x0301-47977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2020.1111283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03766naa a2200757 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001700094024002300111024002800134024002300162024004000185024002500225040001800250100001800268245014600286300001400432500002000446520118800466592002801654596005301682650002201735650002601757650002601783650001601809650002801825650002301853650001701876650001501893650001401908650001001922650002301932650002201955650002201977650002601999650001802025650001302043650001602056650001302072650001702085651001302102700002402115700005802139700002002197700002102217700001902238700002002257700006402277700005902341700003002400700001802430700001502448700001602463700002302479700006102502700005502563700002002618700002302638773012402661856011402785856007502899961001302974852000902987655001202996IND60694957220221214225006.0220819e202001  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069495722DNAL7 a3643842aris7 a10113/69495722hdl7 a10.1002/plr2.200182doi7 a3643842seq_no_1157 a6066-21220-014-00D2aris_project_no7 a4352732aris_accn_no  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Pengyin10aRegistration of ‘S14‐15146GT’ soybean, a high‐yielding RR1 cultivar with high oil content and broad disease resistance and adaptation  ap. 35-42.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aS14‐15146GT (Reg. no. CV‐534, PI 691841) is a late‐maturity group IV (relative maturity 4.6) indeterminate glyphosate‐tolerant soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] cultivar developed and released by the University of Missouri Fisher Delta Research Center Soybean Breeding program. High global demand for soybean oil and US southern growers’ preference for taller soybean plants with early maturity led to the release of this cultivar. S14‐15146GT was evaluated in 130 environments across 10 states and showed high yield potential and wide adaptation in Missouri and other southern states. It is resistant to Phytophthora root rot, stem canker, sudden death syndrome, frogeye leaf spot, and charcoal rot. S14‐15146GT has white flowers, tawny pubescence, and tan pod walls. Seeds of S14‐15146GT have black hilum, yellow cotyledon, and intermediate luster. S14‐15146 GT seed averages 235.5 and 390.8 g kg⁻¹ oil and protein content, respectively. The early maturity with the first‐generation Roundup Ready trait, high yield potential, high oil content, broad disease resistance package, and wide adaptation make S14‐15146GT an excellent choice for southern growers.  aPublisher supplied data  aMSMC 301cMissouri Soybean Merchandising Council 3aCercospora sojina 3aDiaporthe phaseolorum 3aFusarium virguliforme 3aGlycine max 3aMacrophomina phaseolina 3aPhytophthora sojae 3acharcoal rot 3acotyledons 3acultivars 3adeath 3adisease resistance 3aearly development 3afrogeye leaf spot 3aglyphosate resistance 3alipid content 3aroot rot 3asoybean oil 3asoybeans 3astem cankers 3aMissouri1 aShannon, J.

The unknown mechanism of controlling tree transpiration under different drought conditions restricted the development of farmland shelterbelt. In this study, we applied sap flow to measure stand transpiration, coupled with calculating canopy conductance, aerodynamic conductance and the decoupling coefficient, to identify the effect of environmental change on farmland shelterbelt transpiration and protection. Results showed stand transpiration of the farmland shelterbelt increased with soil water content rising, the stand transpiration was 7.69 L d⁻¹, 10.48 L d⁻¹ and 15.96 L d⁻¹ at heavy drought, medium drought and wet period, respectively; the daily canopy conductance ranged from 5.32 × 10⁻⁵ to 5.24 × 10⁻⁴ ms⁻¹. Climate change and water stress affected farmland shelterbelt transpiration by changing stomata and leaf area index. Stomata controls most of the stand transpiration in heavy dry and wet periods, while temperature, relative humid and solar radiation play more important roles in moderately dry periods. In the shelterbelt, it is the atmospheric demand and vapor pressure deficit that control farmland shelterbelt stand transpiration. This investigation provides a preliminary interpretation of the mechanism of the motion of shelterbelt transpiration in China’s semi-arid region.  aPublisher supplied data  a2017M612161cChina Postdoctoral Science Foundation  a2017KY05cjiangxi postdoctoral science foundation  a41390461cNational Natural Science Foundation of China 3aPopulus simonii 3aaerodynamics 3aagricultural land 3aagroforestry 3acanopy 3aclimate change 3adrought 3aecosystems 3aleaf area index 3aoases 3asap flow 3asemiarid zones 3asoil water content 3asolar radiation 3atemperature 3atranspiration 3atrees 3avapor pressure deficit 3awater stress 3aChina1 aXiao, Yuan1 aLuo, Yi1 aSun, Lin1 aWu, Daishe0 tAgroforestry systems.g2020 June, v. 94, no. 3 p.719-731dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl34245x0167-43667nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10457-019-00440-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02090naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100002000188245014400208300001600352520105300368592002801421653002301449653002601472653002201498653001601520653002301536653002001559700002001579773007301599856008301672852000901755655001201764IND60124565420221123020602.0151025e201103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012456542DNAL7 a10.1007/s13280-010-0131-32doi7 aPMC33577942pmcid7 a214463982pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGarrelts, Heiko10aPath Dependencies and Path Change in Complex Fields of Action: Climate Adaptation Policies in Germany in the Realm of Flood Risk Management  ap. 200-209.  aThe spatial and temporal repercussions of climate change are of an extremely complex nature. Coping with climate change is, first and foremost, a challenge to political decision making and, considering the long-term effects of the climate system, to planning. However, there have never been more doubts that the political-administrative system is able to meet these requirements. Although much evidence has been put forward in favor of such skepticism, sometimes, it is dangerous to overstate the existing limits. Drawing on two case studies in the area of flood risk management in Germany, the article illustrates how and why significant path change came about. In both cases, the state proved to still being a pivotal actor, due to a number of functions that cannot be assumed by other actors. However, other actor groups——such as actors from science, the media, NGOs, and citizen groups——play a significant role as well by providing relevant expertise and influencing the public discourse, thus mobilizing significant political pressure.  aPublisher supplied data 0aClimate adaptation 0aFlood risk management 0aNorthwest Germany 0aPath change 0aPolitical steering 0aPolicy analysis1 aLange, Hellmuth0 tAmbio.g2011 Mar., v. 40, no. 2 p.200-209dSpringerx0044-74477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007%2Fs13280-010-0131-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02733naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245015600169300001800325520115300343592002801496650002601524650001801550650001101568650001901579650001001598650001401608650001201622650003001634650001201664650002301676650001101699650004301710650001901753650001301772650001101785650001501796653001901811653001201830653002201842653001901864653002501883700002301908700002501931700001701956773016401973856008102137852000902218655001202227IND60531413820221118173618.0170320e201611  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053141382DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apr.2016.06.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPérez, Isidro A.10aFeatures of the annual evolution of CO2 and CH4 in the atmosphere of a Mediterranean climate site studied using a nonparametric and a harmonic function  ap. 1013-1021.  aConcentrations of CO2 and CH4 measured over 3 years at a rural site in the Spanish northern plateau were investigated together with vegetation and meteorological variables. Two procedures were implemented to study the annual evolution. Kernel estimation provided a detailed time description, and the harmonic model may be fitted easily. The site was characterised by grass from autumn to spring. However, vigorous growth was observed during the latter season due to the biological cycle of plants under favourable meteorological conditions. A CO2 peak was observed a fortnight before the time of maximum NDVI, and was attributed to the prevalence of respiration over photosynthesis. A pronounced trough was apparent in summer and was explained by the death of vegetation and active dispersion in a highly developed boundary layer. CH4 evolution was characterised by a deficit period from May to October, indicating that meteorological evolution played a key role. The harmonic model showed that annual and half-annual cycles evidenced a similar contribution for CO2, whereas said weight for the half-annual cycle was considerably smaller for CH4.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMediterranean climate 3aair pollution 3aautumn 3acarbon dioxide 3adeath 3aevolution 3agrasses 3ameteorological parameters 3amethane 3amethane production 3amodels 3anormalized difference vegetation index 3aphotosynthesis 3aplateaus 3asummer 3avegetation 0aCarbon dioxide 0aMethane 0aKernel regression 0aHarmonic model 0aSouth-western Europe1 aSánchez, M.

Two wheat cultivars were grown in three locations, and glyphosate was applied at the recommended rate at the soft dough stage (early application) and the ripe stage (recommended application time). When glyphosate was applied at the soft dough stage, kernel weight, wheat protein and wet gluten decreased significantly (p ≤ 0.05), however, gluten index significantly increased (p ≤ 0.05). Dough quality, farinograph stability, and quality number were significantly (p ≤ 0.05) higher when glyphosate was applied at the soft dough stage, and absorption and the mixing tolerance index were lower. As for baking quality, loaf volume and mix time were significantly (p ≤ 0.05) higher in the treated samples in comparison to the untreated control, and other baking quality characteristics did not show any significant difference. Overall, the results indicate that spring wheat quality characteristics are impacted to the greatest degree when glyphosate is applied earlier than recommended at the soft dough stage, as opposed to the recommended application at the ripe stage of physiological development.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTriticum 3aabsorption 3aapplication rate 3aapplication timing 3abaking quality 3acultivars 3adough quality 3agluten 3aglyphosate 3aloaves 3amixing 3aseeds 3asoft dough stage 3aspring wheat 3awheat protein1 1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5407-54841 aOhm, Jae-Bom 1 aRansom, Joel K.,1 aHowatt, Kirk 1 aSimsek, Senay 0 tAgriculture (Basel).g2020 Apr. 04, v. 10, no. 4dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:12387x2077-04727nnas40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/69495733Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agriculture100401113Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/ARSUSDA  aDNAL 7aarticle03848naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004400094040001800138100002000156245009500176300001400271500001100285520280100296592002803097650002903125650001503154650001403169650001203183650001903195650001703214650002403231650001103255700002303266773012203289856009003411852000903501655001203510IND60744081020221117160843.0210709e198909  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074408102DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-3164.1990.tb00072.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aScott, Danny W.10aEpidermal Dysplasia And Malassezia pachydermatis Infection In West Highland White Terriers  ap. 25-36.  aREVIEW  a— A chronic, severely pruritic, seborrhoeic skin disorder of West Highland White terriers is reported. The dermatosis has no apparent sex predilection, often begins in animals less than one year of age and is probably genetically programmed. This syndrome is characteristically refractory to standard therapeutic regimens. Histologically the dermatosis is characterized by variable degrees of hyperplastic superficial perivascular dermatitis with a keratinization defect, epidermal dysplasia and the presence of budding yeast in surface and follicular keratin. Malassezia pachydermatis is isolated in pure culture from the skin lesions. Because of the unique histological findings in this syndrome, we propose that the disorder be called “epidermal dysplasia and Malassezia pachydermatis infection in the West Highland White terrier”. Résumé— Une affection cutanée chronique, sévèrement, prurigineuse, séborrhéique, est décrite chez des West Highland White terriers. La dermatose, sans prédisposition apparente de sexe, débute souvent sur des animaux agés de moins d'un an et reconnait probablement une origine héréditaire. La caractéristique de ce syndrome est d'étre résistant aux thérapeutiques habituelles. A l'histologie, la dermatose est caractérisée par des degrés variables de dermatite hyperplasique superficielle périvasculaire avec un défaut de kératinisation une dysplasie épidermique et la présence de levures bourgeonnantes dans la kératine superficielle et folliculaire. Malassezia pachydermatis est isolée en culture pure à partir des lésions cutanées. En raison de l'aspect histologique univoque dans ce syndrome, nous proposons que cette affection soit appelée: “Dysplasie épidermique et infection àMalassezia pachydermatis du West Highland White terrier”. Zusammenfassung— Eine chronische, hochgradig pruriginÖse, seborrhoische Hauterkrankung des Westhighland‐White‐Terriers wird beschrieben. Die Dermatose zeigt keine deutliche Geschlechtsdisposition, beginnt oft im Alter unter einem Jahr und ist wahrscheinlich genetisch bedingt. Dieses Syndrom spricht auf die üblichen therapeatischen Maßnahmen nicht an (Diagnostik durch Biopsie). Histologisch ist diese Dermatose gekennzeichnet durch unterschiedliche Grade einer hyperplastischen, superfiziellen, perivaskulären Dermatitis mit Keratinisierungsdefekt, durch epidermale Dysplasie und die Anwesenheit von Sproßpilzen (Hefen) im oberflächlichen und follikulären Keratin. Aus den Hautveränderungen wird Malassezia pachydermatis in Reinkultur isoliert. Wegen der einzigartigen histologischen Befunde bei diesem Syndrom schlagen wir vor, diese Erkrankung “Epidermale Dysplasie und Malassezia pachydermatis—Infektion beim Westhighland‐White‐Terrier” zu nennen.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMalassezia pachydermatis 3adermatitis 3ahistology 3akeratin 3akeratinization 3atherapeutics 3aveterinary medicine 3ayeasts1 aMiller, William H.0 tVeterinary dermatology.g1989 Sept., v. 1, no. 1 p.25-36dBlackwell Publishing LtdwJournal:jnl46684x0959-44937nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-3164.1990.tb00072.x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02301naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024005500094040001800149100002000167245010700187300001600294520124600310592002801556653001101584653002301595653002301618653002601641653002401667653002601691653002001717700002501737773010101762856011501863852000901978655001201987IND60128531420151115000000.0151115e200704  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012853142DNAL7 a10.3120/0024-9637(2007)54[180:ANVOPG]2.0.CO;22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aErtter, Barbara12aA new variety of potentilla gracilis (rosaceae) and re-evaluation of the potentilla drummondii complex  ap. 180-186.  aField studies and herbarium analyses of populations of Potentilla L. sect. Graciles (Rydb.) A. Nels. with atypical petiole vestiture result in the description of Potentilla gracilis Douglas ex Hook. var. owyheensis as a new variety, differing from var. elmeri and var. flabelliformis in having cottony-tomentose vestiture on the petioles instead of appressed to spreading straight hairs. The new variety grows in mid-montane meadows from the Owyhee Mountains in southwestern Idaho to the Ochoco Mountains in northeastern Oregon. It is conceivably of hybrid origin, with Potentilla breweri S. Watson providing the petiole vestiture that is otherwise unknown in Potentilla sect. Graciles. The study also resulted in the improved understanding of Potentilla bruceae Rydb. as a relatively coherent taxon centered in meadows around Lake Tahoe, California. As a result, Potentilla bruceae, Potentilla drummondii Lehm., and Potentilla breweri are recognized as distinct species, with Potentilla subvillosa Rydb. and Potentilla anomalofolia M.

Although vitamin D is well-known for its promotion in bone health, little is known on its effects directly on bone cells. The objective of this study was to understand the effects of vitamin D₃ release from 3D printed calcium phosphate scaffolds towards bone cell proliferation. In this study, cholecalciferol, a common intake form of vitamin D₃, was successfully able to release from the scaffold matrix via the use of polyethylene glycol. Results showed a decrease in osteoclast resorption pits and healthier osteoblast cellular morphology compared to the control. Additively manufactured tricalcium phosphate scaffolds with designed porosity were loaded with vitamin D₃ and showed controlled release profiles in phosphate buffer and acetate buffer solutions. The release kinetics of vitamin D₃ from calcium phosphate scaffolds enabling osteoblast proliferation and inhibiting osteoclastic resorption can enhance healing for low load bearing applications for bone defects or permeate voids left by tumor resection.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetates 3abone health 3abone resorption 3abones 3acell proliferation 3acholecalciferol 3ahydrophobicity 3aligands 3aneoplasms 3aosteoblasts 3aosteoclasts 3apolyethylene glycol 3aporosity 3aresection 3aresorption 3athree-dimensional printing 3atissue engineering 3atranscription factor NF-kappa B 3atricalcium phosphate1 aBose, Susmita0 tRSC advances.g2019 Oct. 29, v. 9, no. 60 p.34847-34853dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c9ra06630f3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02047naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131100001900149245008800168300001400256520085500270592002801125650002401153650001201177650001101189650002501200650001201225650001101237650003101248650001601279650002801295650001801323650001101341650002301352651001301375700002101388700002001409700002001429773009401449856008501543852000901628655001201637IND4468601620221123003455.0141111e201209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446860162DNAL7 a10.1016/j.indcrop.2012.01.0262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGominho, Jorge10aChemical and fuel properties of stumps biomass from Eucalyptus globulus plantations  ap. 12-16.  aEucalyptus globulus Labill. is managed in commercial plantations for the pulp and paper industry as a coppice system.

Since no reference method is provided, there is a need to develop tools for its quantitative assessment. In this paper we test a recently developed methodology for spatial representativeness area assessment, based on the analysis of time series of model concentrations by means of a Concentration Similarity Frequency (CSF) function, on the Taranto-via Machiavelli industrial monitoring station, located in a mid-size city in Southern Italy. The complex territorial context, the peculiar anthropogenic emissions features, dominated by the contribution of the largest steelworks in Europe, and the critical situation of human health in the city make this application an interesting case study to assess the portability of the CSF approach, so far applied only to background stations, to industrial sites that experience high concentration variability. A comprehensive characterization of the main anthropogenic emissions of the area was carried out, with detailed treatment of dust emission by wind erosion from industrial mineral piles; a Lagrangian modelling approach was chosen to simulate PM10 dispersion patterns, to achieve a reliable and high resolution description of concentration variability around the site. The resulting representativeness area of the station is 0.067 km², fulfilling EU prescriptions for industrial stations. The comprehensive evaluation results, through the comparison with the observed data, showed good performances pointing out the reliability of the estimated concentration fields around the site and consequently of the assessment of its representativeness area.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair pollution 3aair quality 3acase studies 3adust emissions 3ahuman health 3amodels 3amonitoring 3aparticulates 3atime series analysis 3aItaly 0aAir pollution 0aIndustrial emissions 0aMonitoring networks 0aSpatial representativeness 0aLagrangian modelling1 aMorabito, Angela1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0678-58361 aAdani, Mario1 aAssennato, Giorgio1 aCiancarella, L.q(Luisella),1 aCremona, Giuseppe1 aGiua, Roberto1 aPastore, Tiziano1 aPiersanti, Antonio1 aRighini, Gaia1 aRusso, Felicita1 aSpagnolo, Stefano1 aTanzarella, Annalisa1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5324-22521 aTinarelli, Gianni1 aZanini, Gabriele0 tAtmospheric pollution research journal.g2016 Nov., v. 7, no. 6 p.990-1003dElsevier B.V.aTurkish National Committee for Air Pollution Research and ControlwJournal:23231x1309-10427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apr.2016.06.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02077naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001500140245011800155300002000273520092100293592002801214650001201242650001101254650002601265650001101291650001801302650001701320650000901337650000901346650001201355650001101367650000701378650001201385700001601397700001801413700001401431700001501445773012401460856007401584852000901658655001201667IND60675739620221121103647.0191108e20191029xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067573962DNAL7 a10.1039/c9ra06639j2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWu, Yuandi10aTwo-dimensional Cd(ii) coordination polymer encapsulated by Tb³⁺ as a reversible luminescent probe for Fe³⁺  ap. 34949-34957.  aA two-dimensional luminescent cadmium(ii) coordination polymer, [Cd(modbc)₂]ₙ (Cd-P); modbc = 2-methyl-6-oxygen-1,6-dihydro-3,4′-bipyridine-5-carbonitrile, was successfully synthesized by a solvothermal reaction and fully characterized. Cd-P exhibited excellent luminescence emission, and detected Cu²⁺, Co²⁺, Fe²⁺, Hg²⁺, Ni²⁺ and Fe³⁺ ions with high sensitivity and showed good anti-interference performance. After encapsulation of Tb³⁺ ions in Cd-P, the as-obtained fluorescent functionalized Tb³⁺@Cd-P maintained distinct chemical stabilities in different pHs and metal salt solutions. Subsequently, we explored the potential application of Tb³⁺@Cd-P as a probe for Fe³⁺ ions. A new and convenient method for individual identification of Fe³⁺ ions by the combination of Cd-P and Tb³⁺@Cd-P was successfully established. A possible sensing mechanism is discussed in detail.  aPublisher supplied data 3acadmium 3acobalt 3acoordination polymers 3acopper 3aencapsulation 3afluorescence 3aions 3airon 3amercury 3anickel 3apH 3aterbium1 aLin, Meihua1 aLiu, Dongyang1 aLiu, Ming1 aQian, Jing0 tRSC advances.g2019 Oct. 29, v. 9, no. 60 p.34949-34957dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c9ra06639j3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03877naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024003500135040001800170100001700188245017000205300001200375506007600387520213000463592002802593596006902621596012702690506003702817650002502854650001602879650002402895650001402919650001702933650001802950650001802968650003102986650003103017650002203048700001503070700001703085700001503102700001203117700005603129773013103185856008203316852000903398655001203407IND60660419020221207063548.0201028e201912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066041902DNAL7 a314389202pmid7 aPMC67047182pmcid7 a10.1186/s12906-019-2633-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Shaonan10aComparative effectiveness of six Chinese herb formulas for acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: a systematic review and network meta-analysis  ap. 226.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: Six Chinese herb formulas, namely, the Weijing decoction (WJ), the Maxingshigan decoction (MXSG), the Yuebijiabanxia decoction (YBBX), the Qingqihuatan decoction (QQHT), the Dingchuan decoction (DC) and the Sangbaipi decoction (SBP), are commonly used, along with routine pharmacotherapy, to manage the acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (AECOPD). In this study, we conducted a systematic review to summarize the efficacy of these six formulas, and we also conducted a network meta-analysis (NMA) to rank these formulas. METHODS: We searched five English databases and four Chinese databases, with dates ranging from the starting dates of these databases to December 2016. Randomized controlled trials that evaluated any of the six Chinese herb formulas combined with the use of pharmacotherapy for AECOPD were identified. RESULTS: Fifty-five studies involving 4560 participants were included. The pairwise meta-analyses showed that WJ and QQHT had superior effects on the improvement of lung function (forced expiratory volume in 1 seconds; FEV1) (mean difference (MD): 0.25, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.19–0.30 and 0.34, 95%CI: 0.10–0.58). MXSG, WJ and QQHT were found to be more effective for improving arterial blood gases (PaO2 and PaCO2). In terms of effective rates, all of these formulas had additional favourable effects compared to routine pharmacotherapy. The results of the NMA analyses indicated that only MXSG showed superior add-on effects for the improvement of FEV1 (MD: 0.37, 95% credible interval (CrI): 0.03–0.72). Most of the formulas combined with routine pharmacotherapy were superior to pharmacotherapy alone for the improvement of arterial blood gases and effective rates. The ranking tests suggested that QQHT and MXSG combined with routine pharmacotherapy might be optimal options for the treatment of AECOPD. CONCLUSIONS: This NMA indicated that QQHT and MXSG might be more effective treatment regimens for AECOPD. Further well-designed studies that specifically examine the direct comparisons of these formulas are needed to support our conclusions.  aPublisher supplied data  a2014A020221020cGuangdong Science and Technology Department (CN)  aYN2016QL09cthe Specific Research Fund for TCM Science and Technology of Guangdong Provincial Hospital of Chinese Medicine0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aalternative medicine 3ablood gases 3aconfidence interval 3adatabases 3adrug therapy 3alung function 3ameta-analysis 3arandomized clinical trials 3arespiratory tract diseases 3asystematic review1 aChen, Jing1 aZuo, Jinhong1 aLai, Jiaqi1 aWu, Lei1 aGuo, Xinfeng1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2699-97400 tBMC complementary and alternative medicine.g2019 Dec., v. 19, no. 1 p.226-226dBioMed CentralwJournal:21388x1472-68827nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12906-019-2633-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02531naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001500139245010200154300001800256520139900274592002801673650001501701650002301716650001201739650001301751650004401764650001901808650001101827700001701838700001601855700001301871700001601884700002401900700001801924700001401942773010501956856007502061852000902136655001202145IND60577990420221116164712.0170811e20140722xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057799042DNAL7 a10.1021/ma500664u2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLu, Jiawei10aFrom Polymer Sequence Control to Protein Recognition: Synthesis, Self-Assembly and Lectin Binding  ap. 4676-4683.  aA novel, highly efficient methodology to synthesize gradient glycopolymers has been successfully developed involving concurrent enzymatic monomer transformation and reversible addition–fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) polymerization. By synchronizing enzymatic monomer transformation with polymerization, a continuous supply of the second monomer (glycomonomer) is achieved during the polymerization, resulting in a gradient sugar distribution in the final polymer. Detailed studies of the process using GPC and NMR indicate that the gradient glycopolymers synthesized by RAFT were well controlled. Subsequently, 1,2:3,4-di-O-isopropylidene-6-O-methacryloyl-α-d-galactopyranose (DIMAG) moieties were deprotected to regenerate the sugar and achieve amphiphilic bioactive glycopolymers. We demonstrate the synthesis of a set of glycopolymers with different sequential structures, such as statistical, gradient and block glycopolymers. The glycopolymers with block structure show higher affinities toward the RCA₁₂₀ lectin receptor compared with other structural counterparts. Furthermore, simulation of the self-assembly of three types of copolymers and their binding to lectins provides fundamental insight into this result, revealing the mechanisms underlying the dependence of self-assembling structures and protein adsorption kinetics on the molecular architectures of copolymers.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3acomposite polymers 3alectins 3amoieties 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3apolymerization 3asugars1 aFu, Changkui1 aWang, Shiqi1 aTao, Lei1 aYan, Litang1 aHaddleton, David M.1 aChen, Gaojian1 aWei, Yan,0 tMacromolecules.g2014 July 22, v. 47, no. 14 p.4676-4683dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-58357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fma500664u3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03215naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024003200133040001800165100001800183245015200201300001600353506007600369520134800445592002801793506003701821650003801858650001201896650002201908650003301930650001301963650001701976650003701993650007202030650002902102650003802131650003302169650004702202650002802249650001302277650002802290650003302318650007002351650002602421650002402447650001402471700002002485700002002505773010602525856004502631852000902676655001202685IND4473413620221207082124.0120502e201202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447341362DNAL7 a223379182pmid7 aPMC33152482pmcid7 a10.1105/tpc.111.0918272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTakeda, Naoya10aNuclear-Localized and Deregulated Calcium- and Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinase Activates Rhizobial and Mycorrhizal Responses in Lotus japonicus  ap. 810-822.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe common symbiosis pathway is at the core of symbiosis signaling between plants and soil microbes. In this pathway, calcium- and calmodulin-dependent protein kinase (CCaMK) plays a crucial role in integrating the signals both in arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis (AMS) and in root nodule symbiosis (RNS). However, the molecular mechanism by which CCaMK coordinates AMS and RNS is largely unknown. Here, we report that the gain-of-function (GOF) variants of CCaMK without the regulatory domains activate both AMS and RNS signaling pathways in the absence of symbiotic partners. This activation requires nuclear localization of CCaMK. Enforced nuclear localization of the GOF-CCaMK variants by fusion with a canonical nuclear localization signal enhances signaling activity of AMS and RNS. The GOF-CCaMK variant triggers formation of a structure similar to the prepenetration apparatus, which guides infection of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi to host root cells. In addition, the GOF-CCaMK variants without the regulatory domains partly restore AMS but fail to support rhizobial infection in ccamk mutants. These data indicate that AMS, the more ancient type of symbiosis, can be mainly regulated by the kinase activity of CCaMK, whereas RNS, which evolved more recently, requires complex regulation performed by the regulatory domains of CCaMK.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aLotus corniculatus var. japonicus 3amutants 3amycorrhizal fungi 3anuclear localization signals 3aproteins 3aroot nodules 3avesicular arbuscular mycorrhizae 2aCalcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinasesxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aCell Nucleusxenzymology 2aGene Expression Regulation, Plant 2aGenetic Complementation Test 2aLotusxenzymologyxgeneticsxmicrobiology. 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aMutation 2aMycorrhizaexphysiology 2aNuclear Localization Signals 2aPlants, Genetically Modifiedxenzymologyxgeneticsxmicrobiology. 2aRhizobiumxphysiology 2aSignal Transduction 2aSymbiosis1 aMaekawa, Takaki1 aHayashi, Makoto0 tplant cell.g2012 Feb., v. 24, no. 2 p.810-822dAmerican Society of Plant Biologistsx1040-46517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1105/tpc.111.091827  aDNAL 7aarticle02739naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100005700149245006200206520145300268592002801721650001301749650002501762650002701787650001101814650001801825650001101843650001501854650001501869653001801884653001801902653003001920653001901950653002101969653001401990700006502004700001902069700002202088700001902110773009502129856008402224852000902308655001202317IND60771607420221120235025.0220614e20220701xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077160742DNAL7 a10.1016/j.appet.2022.1060102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBleakley, Amy1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4539-442412aA content analysis of sports and energy drink advertising  aThis study identifies constructs from key persuasion theories that are present in popular sports and energy drink advertising. A theory-driven content analysis was conducted on 315 popular television and social media sports and energy drink advertisements from top selling brands. The advertisements were analyzed for the presence of persuasive cues as per the Elaboration Likelihood Model (e.g, onscreen consumption, presence of celebrities) as well as Reasoned Action behavioral expectancies and normative beliefs Approach related to consumption. Descriptive statistics were calculated. Differences between sports and energy drinks were assessed and reliability statistics for all codes were calculated. Advertisements relied on peripheral cues like sports and celebrities that were not related to the drinks themselves. Theory-relevant beliefs about improved athletic performance and consumption of the drinks onscreen were common. Sports drinks were more likely to focus on mainstream sports; energy drinks featured extreme sports, and energy drink advertisements promoted the drinks for use beyond sports (e.g., work settings). The cues and beliefs identified in these ads help to clarify the role of advertising in beliefs about sports drinks being healthy and energy drinks being helpful to achieve goals. Future research is needed that links exposure to coded advertisement features to adolescents’ beliefs about sports and energy drinks.  aPublisher supplied data 3aappetite 3aathletic performance 3adescriptive statistics 3aenergy 3aenergy drinks 3amodels 3apersuasion 3atelevision 0aSports drinks 0aEnergy drinks 0aSugar sweetened beverages 0aAdvertisements 0aContent analysis 0aMarketing1 aEllithorpe, Morgan E.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0317-92671 aJordan, Amy B.1 aHennessy, Michael1 aStevens, Robin0 tAppetite.g2022 July 01, v. 174 p.106010-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl31756x0195-66637nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.appet.2022.1060103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03351naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100002100112245020900133300001600342520166400358592002802022650003202050650002402082650002702106650002302133650002002156650000902176650000902185650001502194650001602209650001802225650002602243650001402269650002102283650001402304650001902318650001802337650001202355650001302367650001302380651001602393653002402409653002702433653002302460653001302483653001602496700002102512700001802533700002002551700001802571700001702589700001702606700002002623773012102643852000902764655001202773IND60128926920221120150628.0151124e201407  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012892692DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChae, Seong Chun10aPredation and Control Efficacies of Misgurnus mizolepis (Cypriniformes: Cobitidae) Toward Culex pipiens molestus (Diptera: Culicidae) and Fish Toxicity of Temephos in Laboratory and Septic Tank Conditions  ap. 817-823.  aCulex pipiens molestus Forskal (Diptera: Culicidae) is the dominant mosquito species in septic tanks in South Korea. An assessment was made of the biological control potential of mud loaches, Misgurnus mizolepis Günther (Cypriniformes: Cobitidae), toward Cx. p. molestus larvae in laboratory and septic tanks. Results were compared with those of temephos 20% emulsifiable concentrate. In laboratory tests, all mud loaches survived on sedimentation chamber- and effluent chamber-collected water of aerobic septic tanks (ASTs), whereas all mud loaches died within 3–12 h after introduction into sedimentation chamber- and effluent chamber-collected water of anaerobic septic tanks. Gill hyperplasia and hemorrhages at the bases of pectoral fins were detected in all dead mud loaches. These appeared to have been caused by bacterial disease, rather than the physical and chemical characteristics of the septic tank water. A mud loach consumed an average range of 1,072–1,058 larvae of Cx. p. molestus in the AST water at 24 h. At the manufacturer's recommended rate (10 ml/ton) in the AST water, the temephos formulation did not cause fish mortality. In the AST experiment, predation of mosquito larvae by mud loaches at a release rate of one fish per 900 mosquito larvae resulted in complete mosquito control from the third day after treatment throughout the 18-wk survey period, compared with temephos 20% emulsifiable concentrate-treated AST water (reduction rate, 40% at 28 days after treatment). Reasonable mosquito control in aerobic septic tanks can be achieved by mosquito breeding season stocking of a rate of one mud loach per 900 mosquito larvae.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCulex pipiens form molestus 3aMisgurnus mizolepis 3aaspartate transaminase 3abiological control 3abreeding season 3afins 3afish 3ahemorrhage 3ahyperplasia 3ainsect larvae 3alaboratory techniques 3amortality 3amosquito control 3apredation 3aseptic systems 3astocking rate 3asurveys 3atemephos 3atoxicity 3aSouth Korea 0aMisgurnus mizolepis 0aCulex pipiens molestus 0abiological control 0atemephos 0aseptic tank1 aKwon, Young Hyun1 aMin, Kyung Il1 aKim, Hyŏng-su,1 aKim, Nam-jin,1 aKim, Jun-Ran1 aSon, Bong Gi1 aAhn, Young-Joon0 tJournal of medical entomology.g2014 July, v. 51, no. 4 p.817-823dEntomological Society of Americax0022-25857nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle02644naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100005700150245010000207300001800307520113200325592002801457650002001485650001501505650002001520650002001540650001501560650001801575650000701593650001801600650002701618650002101645650002501666650001901691653001501710653001801725653001401743653002501757653002701782700001501809700001601824700001801840700001401858700001501872700001801887700002401905700001501929773008901944856008402033852000902117655001202126IND60603673920221120163456.0180716e201509  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060367392DNAL7 a10.1016/j.energy.2015.06.1052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSolangi, K.H.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6708-562512aA comprehensive review of thermo-physical properties and convective heat transfer to nanofluids  ap. 1065-1086.  aNanofluids are fluid nanoparticle suspensions that exhibit enhanced properties at modest nanoparticle concentrations. Nanofluids have unique heat transfer properties and are utilized in high heat flux systems (e.g., electronic cooling systems, heat exchanger liquids, solar collectors, and nuclear reactors). However, suspension stability is critical in the development and application of these heat transfer fluids. Reynolds number, mass concentration, and particle size control the heat transfer behavior of fluids. Sedimentation and agglomeration of nanoparticles in nanofluids and their dispersion have rarely been investigated. Therefore, this paper explains the parameters that affect the stability of nanofluids and the different techniques used to evaluate the stability of nanofluids. This paper also presents an updated review of properties of nanofluids, such as physical (thermal conductivity) and rheological properties, with emphasis on their heat transfer enhancement characteristics. Studies on zeta potential as a function of pH are discussed and extended further to identify opportunities for future research.  aPublisher supplied data 3aReynolds number 3aconvection 3acooling systems 3aheat exchangers 3ananofluids 3ananoparticles 3apH 3aparticle size 3arheological properties 3asolar collectors 3athermal conductivity 3azeta potential 0aNanofluids 0aHeat transfer 0aStability 0aThermal conductivity 0aRheological properties1 aKazi, S.N.1 aLuhur, M.R.1 aBadarudin, A.1 aAmiri, A.1 aSadri, Rad1 aZubir, M.N.M.1 aGharehkhani, Samira1 aTeng, K.H.0 tEnergy.g2015 Sept., v. 89 p.1065-1086dElsevier LtdwJournal:12436x0360-54427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2015.06.1053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02925naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245009100169300001800260520152300278592002801801650002901829650001201858650001501870650001401885650002301899650001501922650002201937650002001959650000901979650002601988650001602014650002302030651002002053651001502073653002502088653002502113653001702138653001402155700006002169700001502229700001702244773009902261856008602360852000902446655001202455IND60648507320221120065537.0190719e20190726xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064850732DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vaccine.2019.06.0792doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBriggs, Lynne10aPerceptions of influenza and pneumococcal vaccine uptake by older persons in Australia  ap. 4454-4459.  aInfluenza and pneumococcal vaccinations reduce adverse health outcomes in older adults. The Australian National Immunisation Program (NIP) provides free seasonal influenza and pneumococcal vaccinations for adults ≥65 y. Guidelines recommend all adults ≥65 y receive one dose of 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (23vPPV) regardless of their risk of invasive pneumococcal disease. However, the reported rate of vaccination against pneumococcal disease is much lower than seasonal influenza. Identifying and understanding the perspective of older people on vaccination is important to informing effective promotional strategies for this age group.Using a purposive and snowball recruitment strategy, 36 participants aged between 65 and 84 years of age were recruited in south-east Queensland and northern New South Wales. Face-to-face qualitative interviews conducted between July 2017 and January 2018 were recorded, transcribed and thematically analysed.In this sample, the uptake of the influenza vaccine (n = 28, 78%) was greater than for the pneumococcal vaccine (n = 14, 39%). Five key themes identified were health practitioner influence; anti-vaccination influence; social responsibility; work-based vaccination; and perceptions of age. The influences on uptake were complex and multi-faceted.Findings provide new insights, in particular, the role of social responsibility, the long-term impact of workplace vaccinations, and how older people do not necessarily consider themselves old.  aPublisher supplied data 3aStreptococcus pneumoniae 3aelderly 3aguidelines 3ainfluenza 3ainfluenza vaccines 3ainterviews 3along term effects 3apolysaccharides 3arisk 3asocial responsibility 3avaccination 3aworking conditions 3aNew South Wales 3aQueensland 0aPneumococcal disease 0aImmunisation program 0aOlder adults 0aAustralia1 aFronek, Patricia1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0454-71481 aQuinn, Val1 aWilde, Tracy0 tVaccine.g2019 July 26, v. 37, no. 32 p.4454-4459dElsevier LtdwJournal:6210x0264-410X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2019.06.0793Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02280naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001600140245012200156300002000278520105300298592002801351650002401379650002601403650001101429650001901440650001101459650003401470650001201504650001401516700002101530700001401551700002401565700001901589700002501608700002601633700001601659773012401675856007401799852000901873655001201882IND60675740020221121210701.0191108e20191104xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067574002DNAL7 a10.1039/c9ra06764g2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAbb, Sabine10aPolymorphism in carbohydrate self-assembly at surfaces: STM imaging and theoretical modelling of trehalose on Cu(100)  ap. 35813-35819.  aSaccharides, also commonly known as carbohydrates, are ubiquitous biomolecules, but little is known about their interaction with surfaces. Soft-landing electrospray ion beam deposition in conjunction with high-resolution imaging by scanning tunneling microscopy now provides access to the molecular details of the surface assembly of this important class of bio-molecules. Among carbohydrates, the disaccharide trehalose is outstanding as it enables strong anhydrobiotic effects in biosystems. This ability is closely related to the observed polymorphism. In this work, we explore the self-assembly of trehalose on the Cu(100) surface. Molecular imaging reveals the details of the assembly properties in this reduced symmetry environment. Already at room temperature, we observe a variety of self-assembled motifs, in contrast to other disaccharides like e.g. sucrose. Using a multistage modeling approach, we rationalize the conformation of trehalose on the copper surface as well as the intermolecular interactions and the self-assembly behavior.  aPublisher supplied data 3aambient temperature 3achemical interactions 3acopper 3aimage analysis 3amodels 3ascanning tunneling microscopy 3asucrose 3atrehalose1 aTarrat, Nathalie1 aDuquende,1 aAndriyevsky, Bohdan1 aHarnau, Ludger1 aSchön, J.

An urban riparian restoration project along Strawberry Creek (Berkeley, CA) began with the goal of removing exotic vegetation and restoring native plant coverage. However, through the involvement of local high school and college students, the project accomplished an additional goal of educating the local community about restoration and conservation. Undergraduate students at the University of California, Berkeley conducted pre-restoration vegetation surveys of species richness and cover in order to assess initial species composition at the restoration site. Berkeley High School students, under the guidance of UC Berkeley graduate student mentors, removed exotic vegetation from an 800 m² area of the riparian zone and replaced exotics with over 500 individual native plants. Post-restoration vegetation surveys found that this project succeeded in reducing the cover of exotic vegetation and increasing native species richness. A smaller area adjacent to the student plantings was more intensively maintained by the University of California, Berkeley Office of Environment, Health & Safety and had a higher survival rate among the natives planted. Student attitudinal surveys indicated that students' involvement in the restoration activities increased their awareness and appreciation of the creek's value and educated them about scientific concepts of restoration and conservation. In spite of the various challenges of coordinating several interest groups, the involvement of local students has the potential to increase the likelihood that the project will succeed in the long term, especially if such involvement signals greater appreciation for the creek habitat.  aPublisher supplied data 0aexotic vegetation removal 0ariparian 0arestoration 0astudents 0aurban1 aCorbin, Jeffrey D.1 aHans, Karl E.0 tMadroño.g2007 July 5, v. 54, no. 3 p.258-267dCalifornia Botanical Society, Incx0024-96377nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3120%2F0024-9637%282007%2954%5B258%3AURRAOC%5D2.0.CO%3B23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02953naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002000139245016200159300001800321500002000339520133300359592002801692596004401720650001401764650001801778650001501796650002401811650001601835650001001851650001201861650003101873650001001904650001301914650001501927650001501942650001201957650001001969650001201979650001301991650001102004700001402015700002502029700006902054700002102123700002402144700006102168773012302229856007402352852000902426655001202435IND60793574420221120194834.0220919e202210  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079357442DNAL7 a10.1111/are.160082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHaldar, Chandan10aStudies on the Indian catfish Clarias magur reveal Insulin‐Like Growth Factor II to be the major type and its upregulation in high‐growth performing fish  ap. 5253-5260.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aExpression of three growth‐associated genes, IGF‐I, IGF‐II and IGF acid‐labile subunit (IGFALS), was compared between highest and lowest growth performing families of Clarias magur being genetically selected for growth. Only IGF‐II and IGFALS showed 3.50‐ and 2.10‐fold differential expression, respectively, in RNASeq data of five pooled tissues, brain, liver, muscle, kidney and gonads. Relative expression profiling in brain, liver and muscle by qPCR showed 3.4‐fold and 2.8‐fold upregulation of IGF‐II in muscle and liver, respectively, in higher performing family compared with the lower ones, while IGF‐I was invariant and also the less expressed gene in all tissues. IGFALS expression was found to vary in accordance with IGF‐II. Genotyping of one non‐synonymous SNP (valine to isoleucine) identified in IGFALS revealed a significantly higher frequency of the isoleucine genotype in the high‐performing group. Present study shows that in magur, IGF‐Is significantly expressed not only in the liver but also in the muscle. Unlike other teleosts like cyprinids and cichlids where IGF‐I has been reported to be the major component in the somatotropic axis, IGF‐II is seen to be the major type in catfish, as also reported in Channel catfish, and is upregulated in high‐growth individuals.  aPublisher supplied data  cIndian Council of Agricultural Research 3aCichlidae 3aClarias magur 3aCyprinidae 3aIctalurus punctatus 3aaquaculture 3abrain 3acatfish 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3agenotype 3agenotyping 3aisoleucine 3akidneys 3aliver 3amuscles 3aresearch 3avaline1 aRam, Raju1 aAnnam, Pavan‐Kumar1 aPathakota, Gireesh‐Babu1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6249-16241 aKoringa, Prakash1 aJoshi, Chaitanya G.1 aChaudhari, Aparna1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3782-47510 tAquaculture research.g2022 Oct., v. 53, no. 15 p.5253-5260dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl53865x1355-557X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/are.160083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02293naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245007200166520119700238592002801435650001401463650002501477650001401502650001101516650001601527650001701543650001101560650001701571650001501588650001001603650002601613650002301639700001801662700002401680773012401704856008201828852000901910655001201919IND60757892120221119102431.0211125e20211024xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075789212DNAL7 a10.3390/pathogens101113762doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJaved, Nouman 10aAdvances in Understanding Vector Behavioural Traits after Infection  aVector behavioural traits, such as fitness, host-seeking, and host-feeding, are key determinants of vectorial capacity, pathogen transmission, and epidemiology of the vector-borne disease. Several studies have shown that infection with pathogens can alter these behavioural traits of the arthropod vector. Here, we review relevant publications to assess how pathogens modulate the behaviour of mosquitoes and ticks, major vectors for human diseases. The research has shown that infection with pathogens alter the mosquito’s flight activity, mating, fecundity, host-seeking, blood-feeding, and adaptations to insecticide bed nets, and similarly modify the tick’s locomotion, questing heights, vertical and horizontal walks, tendency to overcome obstacles, and host-seeking ability. Although some of these behavioural changes may theoretically increase transmission potential of the pathogens, their effect on the disease epidemiology remains to be verified. This study will not only help in understanding virus–vector interactions but will also benefit in establishing role of these behavioural changes in improved epidemiological models and in devising new vector management strategies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCulicidae 3adisease transmission 3afecundity 3aflight 3ahematophagy 3ahost seeking 3ahumans 3ainsecticides 3alocomotion 3aticks 3avector-borne diseases 3avectorial capacity1 aBhatti, Asim 1 aParadkar, Prasad N.0 tPathogens.g2021 Oct. 24, v. 10, no. 11dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27146x2076-08177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/pathogens101113763Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04322naa a2200733 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094024002300134024001700157024003700174024002500211024004000236024002300276040001800299100002000317245010800337500001500445506002800460506005400488506007600542506003100618520159200649596006402241596008702305596008702392596008102479596004402560596004502604596007102649506003702720650002802757650001402785650001102799650001302810650001102823650001302834650001502847650001902862650001202881650003202893650000902925700001802934700001602952700006202968700002903030700001903059700002203078700002303100700002303123700002203146700002403168700002203192700002303214700002503237700002503262773010403287856008403391903002203475961007003497852000903567655001203576IND60694960120221214225547.0200515e201806  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069496012DNAL7 a10.1093/gigascience/giaa0292chorus7 a10113/69496012hdl7 a3740412aris7 a10.1093/gigascience/giaa0292doi7 a4339922aris_accn_no7 a3040-31000-100-00D2aris_project_no7 a3740412seq_no_115  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRice, Edward S.10aContinuous chromosome-scale haplotypes assembled from a single interspecies F1 hybrid of yak and cattle  agolden set  aResource is Open Access  aOxford University Press (OUP) License Information  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aCHORUS License Information  aBackground: The development of trio binning as an approach for assembling diploid genomes has enabled the creation of fully haplotype-resolved reference genomes. Unlike other methods of assembly for diploid genomes, this approach is enhanced, rather than hindered, by the heterozygosity of the individual sequenced. To maximize heterozygosity and simultaneously assemble reference genomes for 2 species, we applied trio binning to an interspecies F1 hybrid of yak (Bos grunniens) and cattle (Bos taurus), 2 species that diverged nearly 5 million years ago. The genomes of both of these species are composed of acrocentric autosomes. Results: We produced the most continuous haplotype-resolved assemblies for a diploid animal yet reported. Both the maternal (yak) and paternal (cattle) assemblies have the largest 2 chromosomes in single haplotigs, and more than one-third of the autosomes similarly lack gaps. The maximum length haplotig produced was 153 Mb without any scaffolding or gap-filling steps and represents the longest haplotig reported for any species. The assemblies are also more complete and accurate than those reported for most other vertebrates, with 97% of mammalian universal single-copy orthologs present. Conclusions: The high heterozygosity inherent to interspecies crosses maximizes the effectiveness of the trio binning method. The interspecies trio binning approach we describe is likely to provide the highest-quality assemblies for any pair of species that can interbreed to produce hybrid offspring that develop to sufficient cell numbers for DNA extraction.  cAmerican Radium Societydhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100011983  cInstitute of Agriculture and Natural Resourcesdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100011140  cKorea Health Industry Development Institutedhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100003710  cNational Human Genome Research Institutedhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100000051  cNIHdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100000002  cUSDAdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100000199  cUniversity of Nebraska-Lincolndhttps://doi.org/10.13039/1000081140 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aacrocentric chromosomes 3aautosomes 3acattle 3adiploidy 3agenome 3agenomics 3ahaplotypes 3aheterozygosity 3ahybrids 3ainterspecific hybridization 3ayaks1 aKoren, Sergey1 aRhie, Arang1 aHeaton, Michael P.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1386-12081 aKalbfleisch, Theodore S.1 aHardy, Timothy1 aHackett, Peter H.1 aBickhart, Derek M.1 aRosen, Benjamin D.1 aVander Ley, Brian1 aMaurer, Nicholas W.1 aGreen, Richard E.1 aPhillippy, Adam M.1 aPetersen, Jessica L.1 aSmith, Timothy P.

Six isonitrogenous and isocaloric diets were prepared using native and pregelatinized corn, sago and tapioca starches. Each diet was randomly assigned to triplicate groups of 20 fish (3.32 ± 0.02 g). Results revealed an interactive influence of starch source and pregelatinization (p < 0.05) on pellet expansion, sinking velocity, durability, water absorption index and water stability. However, the diets did not affect feed intake, growth and feed efficiency of fish. Accordingly, whole‐body composition, nutrient retention and body indices were also insignificant. Digestibility of dry matter, protein and carbohydrate depended on both starch sources and forms (p < 0.05) while α‐amylase activity varied with starch sources and gut regions (p < 0.05). Intestinal villus height of fish varied (p < 0.05) with starch sources and forms, whereas villus width and area differed among combinations of starch sources and forms (p < 0.05). Likewise, hepatocyte size of fish was different among dietary starch source and form combinations. However, the diets did not alter the plasma biochemical composition of fish. Overall, it was concluded that though pregelatinized starch improved pellet quality and nutrient digestibility, tinfoil barb juveniles could equally utilize 19.25% native and pregelatinized corn, tapioca and sago starches.  aPublisher supplied data  aFRGS/1/2020/STG03/UPM/01/2cMinistry of Higher Education, Malaysia 3aBarbonymus 3aalpha-amylase 3aaquaculture 3achemical composition 3acorn 3adietary carbohydrate 3adigestibility 3adurability 3afeed conversion 3afeed intake 3afeed quality 3afish 3ahistology 3aintestines 3ajuveniles 3aliver 3anutrient retention 3aresearch 3asago 3astarch 3atapioca 3avilli 3awater uptake1 aKamarudin, Mohd Salleh1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1698-74631 aKarim, Murni1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6639-66561 aHassan, Mohd Zafri1 ade Cruz, Clement Roy0 tAquaculture research.g2022 Oct., v. 53, no. 15 p.5142-5158dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl53865x1355-557X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/are.159983Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02016naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100002600188245010500214300001600319520104700335592002801382653001701410653001701427653001601444653001101460653001801471653001301489700002401502773007201526856008301598852000901681655001201690IND60124566320221120183210.0151025e201105  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012456632DNAL7 a10.1007/s13280-010-0114-42doi7 aPMC33578032pmcid7 a216444572pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMontagnini, Florencia10aPayments for Environmental Services in Latin America as a Tool for Restoration and Rural Development  ap. 285-297.  aPayments for Environmental Services (PES) can encourage projects that enhance restoration, production, and rural development. When projects promote differentiated systems by paying farmers for the provision of services, the application of PES requires evaluation of the environmental services provided by each system. We present evaluations of carbon stocks and biodiversity in pure and mixed native tree plantations in Costa Rica. To illustrate how monetary values can be assigned, we discuss a project that awarded PES to silvopastoral systems in Costa Rica, Nicaragua, and Colombia based on carbon stocks and biodiversity. PES can promote positive environmental attitudes in farmers. Currently this project is being scaled up in Colombia based on their positive experiences with PES as a tool to promote adoption. Compared to PES systems that include only one environmental service, systems that incorporate bundling or layering of multiple services can make sustainable land uses more attractive to farmers and reduce perverse incentives.  aPublisher supplied data 0aAdoptability 0aBiodiversity 0aBundled PES 0aCarbon 0aDegraded land 0aLayering1 aFinney, Christopher0 tAmbio.g2011 May, v. 40, no. 3 p.285-297dSpringerx0044-74477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007%2Fs13280-010-0114-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01966naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002800148245006600176300001600242500001900258520109900277592002801376650001201404650001801416650002201434650001101456773013001467856008201597852000901679655001201688IND60698256620221119204602.0200610e202006  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069825662DNAL7 a10.1007/s10739-020-09601-w2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGramelsberger, Gabriele10aSynthetic Morphology: A Vision of Engineering Biological Form  ap. 295-309.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aMorphological engineering is an emerging research area in synthetic biology. In 2008 “synthetic morphology” was proposed as a prospective approach to engineering self-constructing anatomies by Jamie A. Davies of the University of Edinburgh. Synthetic morphology can establish a new paradigm, according to Davies, insofar as “cells can be programmed to organize themselves into specific, designed arrangements, structures and tissues.” It is obvious that this new approach will extrapolate morphology into a new realm beyond the traditional logic of morphological research. However, synthetic morphology is a highly idealized vision of morphology which derives its visionary ideas from morphological engineering and mathematical idealizations in order to understand the principles of molecular morphology. Thus, the question is, if this approach will help to understand morphogenesis better or if it will just enable biologists to engineer morphogenesis. The paper investigates the development of synthetic morphology and its relation to synthetic biology as well as its epistemic gains.  aPublisher supplied data 3ahistory 3amorphogenesis 3asynthetic biology 3avision0 tJournal of the history of biology.g2020 June, v. 53, no. 2 p.295-309dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl3996x0022-50107nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10739-020-09601-w3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02000naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245010500169300001600274520096100290592002801251650001501279650002001294650002201314650001101336650001601347653001901363653001701382653000901399700002301408700001601431700002401447773008601471856008401557852000901641655001201650IND60603674420221120043855.0180716e201508  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060367442DNAL7 a10.1016/j.energy.2015.07.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDíaz, Guzmán10aJoint cost of energy under an optimal economic policy of hybrid power systems subject to uncertainty  ap. 837-848.  aEconomical optimization of hybrid systems is usually performed by means of LCoE (levelized cost of energy) calculation. Previous works deal with the LCoE calculation of the whole hybrid system disregarding an important issue: the stochastic component of the system units must be jointly considered. This paper deals with this issue and proposes a new fast optimal policy that properly calculates the LCoE of a hybrid system and finds the lowest LCoE. This proposed policy also considers the implied competition among power sources when variability of gas and electricity prices are taken into account. Additionally, it presents a comparative between the LCoE of the hybrid system and its individual technologies of generation by means of a fast and robust algorithm based on vector logical computation. Numerical case analyses based on realistic data are presented that valuate the contribution of technologies in a hybrid power system to the joint LCoE.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3aeconomic policy 3aelectricity costs 3aenergy 3auncertainty 0aHybrid systems 0aOptimization 0aLCoE1 aPlanas, Estefanía1 aAndreu, Jon1 aKortabarria, Iñigo0 tEnergy.g2015 Aug., v. 88 p.837-848dElsevier LtdwJournal:12436x0360-54427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2015.07.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02734naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002200094024001900116024003200135040001800167100002600185245013500211300001100346506007600357520122800433592002801661506003701689650002701726650003601753650000801789650001401797650001701811650001401828650003001842650000901872650001001881650001001891700002001901700002101921700002201942700003401964700002001998700002302018700002102041773011402062856007902176852000902255655001202264IND50064501320221207091429.0210217e201312  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006450132DNAL7 aPMC36144472pmcid7 a235142362pmid7 a10.1186/1746-6148-9-512doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMoustacas, Valéria S10aSpecies-specific multiplex PCR for the diagnosis of Brucella ovis, Actinobacillus seminis, and Histophilus somni infection in rams  ap. 51.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: Infectious ovine epididymitis results in substantial economic losses worldwide due to reproductive failure and culling of breeders. The most common causative agents of these infections are Brucella ovis, Actinobacillus seminis, and Histophilus somni. The aim of this study was to develop a multiplex PCR assay for simultaneous detection of Brucella ovis, Actinobacillus seminis, and Histophilus somni with species-specific primers applied to biological samples for molecular diagnosis of these infections. RESULTS: The multiplex assay was capable of detecting B. ovis, A. seminis, and H. somni DNA simultaneously from genomic bacterial DNA samples and pool of semen samples from experimentally infected rams. The method was highly specific since it did not amplify DNA from other bacterial species that can potentially cause epididymitis in rams as well as species phylogenetically related to B. ovis. All negative control samples were negative in PCR multiplex assay. Urine can be used as an alternative to semen samples. CONCLUSIONS: The species-specific multiplex PCR assay developed in this study can be successfully used for the detection of three of the most common bacterial causes of ovine epididymitis.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aActinobacillus seminis 3aBrucella melitensis biovar Ovis 3aDNA 3aeconomics 3aepididymitis 3aphylogeny 3apolymerase chain reaction 3arams 3asemen 3aurine1 aSilva, Teane MA1 aCosta, Luciana F1 aXavier, Mariana N1 aCarvalho, Custódio A, JrcJr1 aCosta, Érica A1 aPaixão, Tatiane A1 aSantos, Renato L0 tBMC veterinary research.g2013 Dec., v. 9, no. 1 p.51-51dBioMed CentralwJournal:jnl4152735x1746-61487nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1746-6148-9-513Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02596naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100005500147245008400202300001600286520122900302592002801531650005301559650002801612650001601640650001601656650004301672650001201715650001001727651002101737653001801758653000901776653002701785653002801812653002001840700002001860700001501880700001801895700001901913700001901932773012101951856008102072852000902153655001202162IND60632814120221121045646.0190318e201807  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063281412DNAL7 a10.1016/j.lwt.2018.04.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLim, Ho Soo1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7632-430910aAssessment of ferrocyanide intake from food-grade salt in the Korean population  ap. 620-627.  aA simple high-performance liquid chromatography-ultraviolet (HPLC-UV) method for estimating the daily intake of ferrocyanide (FeCN) ion from food-grade salts was developed and validated. The levels of FeCN ion in food-grade salts available in Korean markets were analysed. FeCN ion was detected in 8.9% of 801 samples, with concentrations ranging from ND (not detected) to 9.6 mg/kg. The FeCN-ion levels were below the legal limit (10 mg/kg) specified by the Korean Food Code. The FeCN-ion intake of the Korean population was evaluated by combining food-intake data from the 2012–2014 Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (KNHANES), and the concentration data. The mean estimated daily intakes (EDIs) of the general population and consumers were 0.010 and 0.012 μg/kg bodyweight (bw)/day, respectively, when the mean values from the tested samples were used. The 95th percentile intake levels of both groups were 0.036 and 0.039 μg/kg bw/day, respectively. The EDIs of FeCN ion for all groups were much lower than the acceptable daily intake (ADI) of 0.025 mg/kg bw/day. These results provide useful information about the use of FeCNs as anticaking agents for consumers and manufacturers.  aPublisher supplied data 3aNational Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 3aacceptable daily intake 3abody weight 3afood intake 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3amarkets 3asalts 3aKorean Peninsula 0aFerrocyanides 0aHPLC 0aEstimated daily intake 0aAcceptable daily intake 0aFood-grade salt1 aHwang, Ju Young1 aChoi, EunA1 aLee, Gunyoung1 aYun, Sang Soon1 aKim, Meekyung,0 tLebensmittel-Wissenschaft + Technologie.g2018 July, v. 93 p.620-627dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl1644x0023-64387nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lwt.2018.04.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02774naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245011600169520180300285592002802088650001602116650001002132650001902142650001102161650001402172650001302186650001202199700001702211700001702228773012402245856008202369852000902451655001202460IND60757892520221119102356.0211125e20211020xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075789252DNAL7 a10.3390/pathogens101113522doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNuñez, Ivette A.10aNext-Generation Computationally Designed Influenza Hemagglutinin Vaccines Protect against H5Nx Virus Infections  aH5N1 COBRA hemagglutinin (HA) sequences, termed human COBRA-2 HA, were constructed through layering of HA sequences from viruses isolated from humans collected between 2004–2007 using only clade 2 strains. These COBRA HA proteins, when expressed on the surface of virus-like particles (VLP), elicited protective immune responses in mice, ferrets, and non-human primates. However, these vaccines were not as effective at inducing neutralizing antibodies against newly circulating viruses. Therefore, COBRA HA-based vaccines were updated in order to elicit protective antibodies against the current circulating clades of H5Nx viruses. Next-generation COBRA HA vaccines were designed to encompass the newly emerging viruses circulating in wild avian populations. HA amino acid sequences from avian and human H5 influenza viruses isolated between 2011–2017 were downloaded from the GISAID (Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data). Mice were vaccinated with H5 COBRA rHA that elicited antibodies with hemagglutinin inhibition (HAI) activity against H5Nx viruses from five clades. The H5 COBRA rHA vaccine, termed IAN8, elicited protective immune responses against mice challenged with A/Sichuan/26621/2014 and A/Vietnam/1203/2004. This vaccine elicited antibodies with HAI activity against viruses from clades 2.2, 2.3.2.1, 2.3.4.2, 2.2.1 and 2.2.2. Lungs from vaccinated mice had decreased viral titers and the levels of cellular infiltration in mice vaccinated with IAN-8 rHA were similar to mice vaccinated with wild-type HA comparator vaccines or mock vaccinated controls. Overall, these next-generation H5 COBRA HA vaccines elicited protective antibodies against both historical H5Nx influenza viruses, as well as currently circulating clades of H5N1, H5N6, and H5N8 influenza viruses.  aPublisher supplied data 3aamino acids 3abirds 3ahemagglutinins 3ahumans 3ainfluenza 3avaccines 3aviruses1 aHuang, Ying 1 aRoss, Ted M.0 tPathogens.g2021 Oct. 20, v. 10, no. 11dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27146x2076-08177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/pathogens101113523Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03202naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001400151245013000165520176500295592002802060650001602088650001502104650003902119650001302158650001602171650001302187650001602200650001702216650001702233650001802250650001902268650001302287650000702300650001802307650001302325650002502338650002002363650002502383653001302408653001302421653001202434653001802446653002402464700002402488773010102512856008602613852000902699655001202708IND60648507820221120065644.0200220e201912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064850782DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodhyd.2019.1051792doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Min14aThe influence of protein/phospholipid ratio on the physicochemical and interfacial properties of biomimetic milk fat globules  aThe effect of protein/phospholipid ratio on the physicochemical and interfacial properties of biomimetic milk fat globules (BMFGs) was investigated. Butter milk phospholipid (BMP) vesicles prepared with ultrasonication were mixed with whey protein isolate (WPI) at different protein/phospholipid ratios (w/w). After emulsification, the Turbiscan stability index (TSI) was used to quantify the initial stability of BMFGs. At different pH values, visual observation and CLSM were performed to obtain the macro stability and microstructure of BMFGs. In addition, large amplitude oscillatory surface rheology was applied and analysed with Lissajous curves, to explore the oil/water interfacial properties of BMFGs in the nonlinear viscoelastic regime. The TSI indicated a faster creaming rate of BMP stabilized droplets compared to those stabilized by WPI. The macro stability of WPI/BMP co-stabilized BMFGs at different pH was dominated by WPI and BMFGs prepared at the WPI/BMP ratio of 20:80 phase separated from pH 3.0 to 5.0. At acidic pH, the WPI/BMP ratios strongly affected the coalescence and flocculation of BMFGs at the micro level. The surface elasticity indicated that WPI dominated the rheological properties of WPI/BMP co-stabilized oil/water interfaces. Besides, the significant dependence of surface elasticity on deformation amplitudes within the nonlinear regime of WPI stabilized oil/water interfaces indicated a clearly different structure from BMP stabilized interfaces. Conclusively, results of this study showed that the physicochemical and interfacial properties of BMFGs were significantly influenced by the protein/phospholipid ratio in the bulk, which needs to be considered in the design and application of biomimetic milk fat globules.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiomimetics 3abuttermilk 3aconfocal laser scanning microscopy 3acreaming 3adeformation 3adroplets 3aemulsifying 3afat globules 3aflocculation 3ahydrocolloids 3amicrostructure 3amilk fat 3apH 3aphospholipids 3arheology 3aultrasonic treatment 3aviscoelasticity 3awhey protein isolate 0aEmulsion 0aMilk fat 0aProtein 0aPhospholipids 0aOil/water interface1 aSagis, Leonard M.C.0 tFood hydrocolloids.g2019 Dec., v. 97 p.105179-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46643x0268-005X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodhyd.2019.1051793Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03455naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001600139245021000155300001800365500002000383520154700403592002801950596006501978596009502043596002502138596001902163596002102182596001002203596007302213650002502286650002202311650001902333650001602352650001002368650001602378650001602394650002102410650001002431650001202441650001302453650001502466650002402481650001102505700001402516700001902530700001602549700001702565700005902582700005402641773012302695856007402818852000902892655001202901IND60793574920221120194809.0220919e202210  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079357492DNAL7 a10.1111/are.160222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Dixin10aTissue distribution and nutritional regulation of peroxisomal fatty acid β‐oxidation genes: A preliminary study in two marine teleosts, turbot (Scophthalmus maximus) and tiger puffer (Takifugu rubripes)  ap. 5434-5443.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aPeroxisome plays an important role in the modulation of lipid catabolism in fish. The present study investigated the tissue distribution of five peroxisomal fatty acid β‐oxidation genes, including vlcs, acox1, acox3, ehhadh and acaa1, in turbot and tiger puffer. Their expressions in response to different nutritional status (starvation and change in dietary lipid levels) were also studied. Both fish were fed diets with graded lipid levels (8%, 12% and 16%) for 9 weeks, followed by 1‐month of starvation. The five genes were highly expressed in the liver, intestine and pyloric caecum of turbot, and tiger puffer intestine. High‐lipid diets up‐regulated the expression of vlcs and acox3 in tiger puffer liver, whereas did not affect the expression of all genes investigated in turbot. During the starvation, expression of acox1, acox3 and acaa1 in turbot liver was increased firstly from day 0 to day 10, and then was decreased, while expression of vlcs in muscle, and acaa1 in muscle and subcutaneous adipose tissue was linearly increased. In tiger puffer liver, the expression of peroxisomal β‐oxidation genes increased linearly with starvation time, but the expression of acox3, ehhadh and acaa1 in the muscle firstly increased from day 0 to day 4–9, and thereafter decreased. In conclusion, the peroxisomal fatty acid β‐oxidation genes were highly expressed in the liver and intestine of both turbot and tiger puffer, and starvation could stimulate and high dietary lipid levels have less impact on their expression.  aPublisher supplied data  aCARS‐47cChina Agriculture Research System of MOF and MARA  aZR2021YQ24cNatural Science Foundation of Shandong Province‐Outstanding Youth Foundation  a20603022022004cCAFS  a2020TD48cCAFS  a2022XT0403cCAFS  cYSFRI  cCentral Public‐Interest Scientific Institution Basal Research Fund 3aScophthalmus maximus 3aTakifugu rubripes 3aadipose tissue 3aaquaculture 3acecum 3adietary fat 3afatty acids 3alipid metabolism 3aliver 3amuscles 3aresearch 3astarvation 3atissue distribution 3aturbot1 aMa, Qiang1 aLiao, Zhangbin1 aBi, Qingzhu1 aWei, Yuliang1 aLiang, Mengqing1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3241-414X1 aXu, Houguo1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1000-99280 tAquaculture research.g2022 Oct., v. 53, no. 15 p.5434-5443dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl53865x1355-557X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/are.160223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02296naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002400148245012300172300001600295520074300311592002801054650002201082650001901104650003801123650003501161650001801196650001801214650001101232650001301243650001801256653002001274653001201294653001601306653000801322653002901330653003201359653001401391653000901405700002201414700001901436700002801455700006301483700001701546700002401563773012401587856008201711852000901793655001201802IND60599283920221120085502.0180702e20140501xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059928392DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcis.2014.01.0402doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSarpietro, Maria G.10aCalorimetry and Langmuir–Blodgett studies on the interaction of a lipophilic prodrug of LHRH with biomembrane models  ap. 122-131.  aThe interaction between an amphiphilic luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) prodrug that incorporated a lipoamino acid moiety (C12-LAA) with biological membrane models that consisted of multilamellar liposomes (MLVs) and phospholipid monolayers, was studied using Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) and Langmuir–Blodgett film techniques.

Two identical SAH: conventional and modified SAH are tested with different Reynolds number ranging from 6000 to 12,000. Circular and V-shape turbulators are fixed in the absorber plate of modified SAH at six different configurations; inline arrangements with 4 × 4 (type-a), 5 × 4 (type-b), 6 × 4 (type-c) and 6 × 4 zigzag arrangement of circular inserts (type-d). Experiments are extended by introducing V-type inserts in convex (type-e) and concave shape (type-f) to create additional turbulence motion. Experiment results revealed that the system efficiency increases with Reynolds number and number of turbulators in absorber plate. Air temperature reaches an upper value of 66 °C in type-f with the mass flow rate of 57.7 kg/hr. Nusselt number increases with the Reynolds number and reaches the maximum of 210 for type-f turbulators at Reynolds number of 11615. Thermal enhancement factor decreases with increase in Reynolds number for all modifications. First law, thermohydraulic and second law efficiency increases up to 85%, 63% and 45% respectively for type-f at Reynolds number of 11615. Theoretical analysis also carried out and agrees well with experimental results.  aPublisher supplied data 3aReynolds number 3aair temperature 3amass flow 3aturbulent flow 0aSolar air heater 0aCircular turbulator 0aV-shape turbulator 0aExergy analysis 0aThermal enhancement factor 0aPerformance study1 aSrinivasan, S.1 aSrithar, K.0 tEnergy.g2015 Aug., v. 88 p.863-873dElsevier LtdwJournal:12436x0360-54427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2015.07.0203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03449naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001800139245017900157300001600336500002000352520160200372592002801974650002502002650001202027650001002039650002602049650001002075650002102085650001802106650002202124650001502146650001202161650001302173650001402186650001702200650002602217650002102243650002502264650002302289650001802312650001602330650001702346700001702363700002302380700001902403700002202422700002402444700001802468700001802486700001702504700002102521700002402542700001902566700002402585700001902609773011302628856007302741852000902814655001202823IND60592027120221119073250.0180327e201804  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059202712DNAL7 a10.1111/tpj.138472doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJeong, In Sil10aPurification and characterization of Arabidopsis thaliana oligosaccharyltransferase complexes from the native host: a protein super‐expression system for structural studies  ap. 131-145.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe oligosaccharyltransferase (OT) complex catalyzes N‐glycosylation of nascent secretory polypeptides in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum. Despite their importance, little is known about the structure and function of plant OT complexes, mainly due to lack of efficient recombinant protein production systems suitable for studies on large plant protein complexes. Here, we purified Arabidopsis OT complexes using the tandem affinity‐tagged OT subunit STAUROSPORINE AND TEMPERATURE SENSITIVE3a (STT3a) expressed by an Arabidopsis protein super‐expression platform. Mass‐spectrometry analysis of the purified complexes identified three essential OT subunits, OLIGOSACCHARYLTRANSFERASE1 (OST1), HAPLESS6 (HAP6), DEFECTIVE GLYCOSYLATION1 (DGL1), and a number of ribosomal subunits. Transmission‐electron microscopy showed that STT3a becomes incorporated into OT–ribosome super‐complexes formed in vivo, demonstrating that this expression/purification platform is suitable for analysis of large protein complexes. Pairwise in planta interaction analyses of individual OT subunits demonstrated that all subunits identified in animal OT complexes are conserved in Arabidopsis and physically interact with STT3a. Genetic analysis of newly established OT subunit mutants for OST1 and DEFENDER AGAINST APOTOTIC DEATH (DAD) family genes revealed that OST1 and DAD1/2 subunits are essential for the plant life cycle. However, mutations in these individual isoforms produced much milder growth/underglycosylation phenotypes than previously reported for mutations in DGL1, OST3/6 and STT3a.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3aanimals 3adeath 3aendoplasmic reticulum 3agenes 3agenetic analysis 3aglycosylation 3amass spectrometry 3amicroscopy 3amutants 3amutation 3aphenotype 3apolypeptides 3aproduction technology 3aprotein subunits 3arecombinant proteins 3aribosomal proteins 3astaurosporine 3atemperature 3atransferases1 aLee, Sangmin1 aBonkhofer, Florian1 aTolley, Jordan1 aFukudome, Akihito1 aNagashima, Yukihiro1 aMay, Kimberly1 aRips, Stephan1 aLee, Sang Y.1 aGallois, Patrick1 aRussell, William K.1 aJung, Hyun Suk1 avon Schaewen, Antje1 aKoiwa, Hisashi0 tplant journal.g2018 Apr., v. 94, no. 1 p.131-145dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl47643x0960-74127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/tpj.138473Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03852naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100002000188245011500208300001100323506007600334520232800410592002802738506003702766650002502803650001302828650001802841650002802859650001202887650001002899650001102909650001202920650001602932650002102948650001002969650001902979650002002998650001903018650002103037650002203058650001603080700001503096700001403111773014303125856008103268852000903349655001203358IND60660419920221207062234.0200104e201912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066041992DNAL7 a10.1186/s12970-019-0302-y2doi7 aPMC67045182pmcid7 a314389922pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChappell, A.

Cohorts of professional (PRO) natural bodybuilders offer insights into how these strategies are implemented by elite competitors, and are undocumented in the scientific literature. METHODS: Forty-seven competitors (33 male (8 PRO, 25 amateur (AMA), 14 female (5 PRO, 9 AMA) participated in the study. All PROs were eligible to compete with the Drug Free Athletes Coalition (DFAC), and all AMAs were recruited from the British Natural Bodybuilding Federation (BNBF). Competitors in these organisations are subject to a polygraph and are drug tested in accordance with the World Anti-Doping Agency. We report the results of a cross-sectional study of drug free bodybuilders competing at BNBF qualifying events, and the DFAC and World Natural Bodybuilding Federation finals. Participants completed a 34-item questionnaire assessing dietary intake at three time points (start, middle and end) of competition preparation. Participants recorded their food intake over a 24-h period in grams and/or portions. Dietary intakes of PRO and AMA competitors were then compared. Repeated measures ANOVA was used to test if nutrient intake changed over time, and for associations with division. RESULTS: Male PROs reported significantly (p < 0.05) more bodybuilding experience than AMAs (PRO: 12.3 +/− 9.2, AMA: 2.4 +/− 1.4 yrs). Male PROs lost less body mass per week (PRO: 0.5 +/− 0.1, AMA: 0.7 +/− 0.2%, p < 0.05), and reported more weeks dieting (PRO: 28.1 +/− 8.1, AMA: 21.0 +/− 9.4 wks, P = 0.06). Significant differences (p < 0.05) of carbohydrate and energy were also recorded, as well as a difference (p = 0.03) in the estimated energy deficit (EED), between male PRO (2.0 +/− 5.5 kcal) and AMA (− 3.4 +/− 5.5 kcal) competitors. CONCLUSIONS: Longer diets and slower weight loss utilized by PROs likely contributed towards a lower EED compared to the AMAs. Slower weight loss may constitute an effective strategy for maintaining energy availability and muscle mass during an energy deficit. These findings require corroboration, but will interest bodybuilders and coaches.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aanalysis of variance 3aathletes 3acarbohydrates 3across-sectional studies 3adieting 3adrugs 3aenergy 3afemales 3afood intake 3alow calorie diet 3amales 3amuscle tissues 3anutrient intake 3aquestionnaires 3asports nutrition 3astrength training 3aweight loss1 aSimper, T.1 aHelms, E.0 tJournal of the International Society of Sports Nutrition.g2019 Dec., v. 16, no. 1 p.35-35dBioMed CentralwJournal:21397x1550-27837nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12970-019-0302-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03107naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100001600112245016100128300001600289520176200305592002802067650001002095650001702105650000802122650001602130650001102146650001202157650002102169650001102190650001502201650000902216650000902225650001602234651001102250653001802261653001702279653002902296653001202325700003102337700002702368700004102395700002102436700002002457700003002477773012102507852000902628655001202637IND60128927920221120131020.0151124e201407  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012892792DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEisen, Lars10aTemporal Correlations between Mosquito-Based Dengue Virus Surveillance Measures or Indoor Mosquito Abundance and Dengue Case Numbers in Mérida City, Mexico  ap. 885-890.  aSurveillance of dengue virus (DENV) in Aedes (Stegomyia) aegypti (L.) females is of potential interest because human DENV infections are commonly asymptomatic, which decreases the effectiveness of dengue case surveillance to provide early warning of building outbreaks. Our primary aim was to examine if mosquito-based virological measures—monthly percentages of examined Ae. aegypti females infected with DENV or examined homes from which at least one DENV-infected Ae. aegypti female was collected—are correlated with reported dengue cases in the same or subsequent months within study neighborhoods in Mérida City, México. The study encompassed ≈30 neighborhoods in the southern and eastern parts of the city. Mosquitoes were collected monthly over a 15-mo period within study homes (average of 145 homes examined per month); this produced ≈5,800 Ae. aegypti females subsequently examined for DENV RNA. Although monthly dengue case numbers in the study neighborhoods varied >100-fold during the study period, we did not find statistically significant positive correlations between monthly data for mosquito-based DENV surveillance measures and reported dengue cases in the same or subsequent months. Monthly average temperature, rainfall, and indoor abundance of Ae. aegypti females were positively correlated (P ≤ 0.001) with dengue case numbers in subsequent months with lag times of 3–5, 2, and 1–2 mo, respectively. However, because dengue outbreak risk is strongly influenced by serotype-specific susceptibility of the human population to DENV, the value of weather conditions and entomological indices to predict outbreaks is very limited. Potential ways to improve the sensitivity of mosquito-based DENV surveillance are discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAedes 3aDengue virus 3aRNA 3acorrelation 3adengue 3afemales 3ahuman population 3ahumans 3amonitoring 3arain 3arisk 3atemperature 3aMexico 0aAedes aegypti 0adengue virus 0avirological surveillance 0aMéxico1 aGarcía-Rejón, Julián E.1 aGómez-Carro, Salvador1 aVázquez, María Del Rosario Nájera1 aKeefe, Thomas J.1 aBeaty, Barry J.1 aLoroño-Pino, María Alba0 tJournal of medical entomology.g2014 July, v. 51, no. 4 p.885-890dEntomological Society of Americax0022-25857nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle02772naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100006000150245013400210300001600344520147600360592002801836650001301864650001601877650002501893650001101918650001201929650002901941650002101970650001301991651001902004653002002023653001402043653001602057653002202073653001802095653000702113700002702120700002402147773008602171856008402257852000902341655001202350IND60603674820221123044236.0180716e201508  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060367482DNAL7 a10.1016/j.energy.2015.07.0212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aByers, Edward A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0349-574212aA framework for the exergy analysis of future transport pathways: Application for the United Kingdom transport system 2010–2050  ap. 849-862.  aExergy analysis has been used to quantify the historical resource use efficiency and environmental impact of transport systems. However, few exergy studies have explored future transport pathways. This study aims to, (a) develop a conceptual framework for the exergy analysis of multiple future transport and electricity pathways, (b) apply this framework to quantify future resource consumption and service delivery patterns, (c) discuss the policy-relevant results that exergy studies of future transport systems can offer. Multiple transport and electricity pathways developed by the UK Government are used to explore changes in energy use, useful work delivery and greenhouse gas emissions. In passenger transport, ambitious electrification results in a 20% increase of useful work delivery, whilst reducing GHG emissions and energy consumption by 65%. For freight, international shipping and aviation, smaller exergy efficiency improvements make useful work delivery and greenhouse gas emissions highly dependent on transport demand. Passenger transport electrification brings a step-change in useful work delivery, which if accompanied by low-carbon electricity, significantly reduces greenhouse gas emissions. The efficiency of low-carbon electricity systems is significant for useful work delivery, but not dominant across the scenarios explored. High penetration of renewables and electrified transport is the most resource-efficient combination in this context.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaviation 3aelectricity 3aenvironmental impact 3aexergy 3afreight 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3agreenhouse gases 3ashipping 3aUnited Kingdom 0aExergy analysis 0aTransport 0aUseful work 0aScenario analysis 0aGHG emissions 0aUK1 aGasparatos, Alexandros1 aSerrenho, André C.0 tEnergy.g2015 Aug., v. 88 p.849-862dElsevier LtdwJournal:12436x0360-54427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2015.07.0213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02105naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024005500094040001800149100002000167245017600187300001600363520093400379592002801313653002101341653002501362653001801387653002201405653002301427653001601450653001801466653002101484653001501505700001901520773010401539856011501643852000901758655001201767IND60128532920151116000000.0151116e20071018xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012853292DNAL7 a10.3120/0024-9637(2007)54[334:CVOANR]2.0.CO;22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFairbarns, Matt10aCastilleja victoriae (Orobanchaceae): a New Rare Species from Southeastern Vancouver Island, British Columbia, Canada, and the Adjacent San Juan Islands, Washington, U.S.A  ap. 334-342.  aCastilleja victoriae is described from the vicinity of southwestern Victoria, southern Vancouver Island, British Columbia, Canada and from San Juan Co., Washington, U.S.A. It is an annual member of subg. Colacus (Jeps.) T.I. Chuang & Heckard, sect. Oncorhynchus (Lehm.) T.I. Chuang & Heckard, formerly placed in the genus Orthocarpus Nutt. It is apparently most closely related to either Castilleja ambigua Hook. & Arn. or Castilleja tenuis (A. Heller) T.I. Chuang & Heckard. The new species differs primarily in its uniformly dull reddish-brown floral bracts and calyces, bicolored and unspotted corollas, and restrictive habitat requirements. Several historic populations are extirpated, and of the three extant populations only one consists of enough individuals in a protected location to be considered reasonably secure. We advocate additional surveys of its limited habitat and conservation measures to protect the species.  aPublisher supplied data 0aBritish Columbia 0aCastilleja victoriae 0aCastillejinae 0achromosome number 0aendangered species 0anew species 0aOrobanchaceae 0aScrophulariaceae 0aWashington1 aMark Egger, J.0 tMadroño.g2007 Oct. 18, v. 54, no. 4 p.334-342dCalifornia Botanical Society, Incx0024-96377nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3120%2F0024-9637%282007%2954%5B334%3ACVOANR%5D2.0.CO%3B23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03270naa a2200649 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245006500163520143500228592002801663650000901691650001801700650001901718650002501737650001601762650001301778650001501791650001001806650002001816650001601836650002701852650001501879650001801894650001201912650002301924650000901947650001301956650001401969650001601983650002601999650002202025650002302047650002502070650001202095650001202107650003602119650003202155650001802187650001002205653001002215653001102225653001602236653001702252653001902269700002102288700002102309700001802330700005702348773011202405856008202517852000902599655001202608IND60648508120221120213251.0190705e201910  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064850812DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fct.2019.1106512doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLee, Wonhwa10aRenal protective effects of aloin in a mouse model of sepsis  aAloin is the major anthraquinone glycoside obtained from the Aloe species and exhibits anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative activities. However, the renal protective effects of aloin and underlying molecular mechanism remain unclear. This study was initiated to determine whether aloin could modulate renal functional damage in a mouse model of sepsis and to elucidate the underlying mechanisms. The potential of aloin treatment to reduce renal damage induced by cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) surgery in mice was measured by assessment of serum creatinine, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), lipid peroxidation, total glutathione, glutathione peroxidase activity, catalase activity, and superoxide dismutase activity. Post-treatment with aloin resulted in a significant reduction in the deleterious renal functions by CLP, such as elevated BUN, creatinine, and urine protein. Moreover, aloin inhibited nuclear factor-κB activation and reduced the induction of nitric oxide synthase and excessive production of nitric acid. Aloin treatment also reduced the plasma levels of interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor-α, reduced lethality due to CLP-induced sepsis, increased lipid peroxidation, and markedly enhanced the antioxidant defense system by restoring the levels of superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase, and catalase in kidney tissues. Our study suggested that aloin protects mice against sepsis-triggered renal injury.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAloe 3aanimal models 3aanthraquinones 3aantioxidant activity 3ablood serum 3acatalase 3acreatinine 3adeath 3aenzyme activity 3aglutathione 3aglutathione peroxidase 3aglycosides 3ainterleukin-6 3akidneys 3alipid peroxidation 3amice 3anecrosis 3aneoplasms 3anitric acid 3anitric oxide synthase 3aprotective effect 3asepsis (infection) 3asuperoxide dismutase 3asurgery 3atissues 3atranscription factor NF-kappa B 3atumor necrosis factor-alpha 3aurea nitrogen 3aurine 0aAloin 0aSepsis 0aAntioxidant 0aRenal injury 0aRenal toxicity1 aJeong, Gil-Saeng1 aBaek, Moon-Chang1 aKu, Sae-Kwang1 aBae, Jong-Sup1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5756-93670 tFood and chemical toxicology.g2019 Oct., v. 132 p.110651-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl33424x0278-69157nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fct.2019.1106513Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02684naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100006100146245008800207300001600295500001900311520104100330536012001371592002801491650003201519650000801551650001801559650001301577650000901590650001501599650001801614650000901632650001001641650002501651650001401676650001201690650001101702650003301713650001201746651001401758653004001772653001501812653001301827700002601840700002201866700006101888773014001949856008002089852000902169655001202178IND60694960820221120093046.0200515e202005  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069496082DNAL7 a10.1177/10406387209122292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWünschmann, Arno1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4292-489610aCerebellar hypoplasia and dysplasia in a juvenile raccoon with parvoviral infection  ap. 463-466.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aA juvenile raccoon (Procyon lotor) was submitted dead to the Minnesota Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory for rabies testing without history. The animal had marked hypoplasia of the cerebellum. Histology demonstrated that most folia lacked granule cells and had randomly misplaced Purkinje cells. Immunohistochemistry revealed the presence of parvoviral antigen in a few neurons and cell processes. PCR targeting feline and canine parvovirus yielded a positive signal. Sequencing analyses from a fragment of the nonstructural protein 1 (NS1) gene and a portion of the viral capsid protein 2 (VP2) gene confirmed the presence of DNA of a recent canine parvovirus variant (CPV-2a–like virus) in the cerebellum. Our study provides evidence that (canine) parvovirus may be associated with cerebellar hypoplasia and dysplasia in raccoons, similar to the disease that occurs naturally and has been reproduced experimentally by feline parvoviral infection of pregnant cats, with subsequent intrauterine or neonatal infections of the offspring.  aFunding The authors received no financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCarnivore protoparvovirus 1 3aDNA 3aProcyon lotor 3aantigens 3acats 3acerebellum 3acoat proteins 3adogs 3agenes 3aimmunohistochemistry 3ajuveniles 3aprogeny 3arabies 3aviral nonstructural proteins 3aviruses 3aMinnesota 0acerebellar hypoplasia and dysplasia 0aparvovirus 0araccoons1 aLopez-Astacio, Robert1 aArmien, Anibal G.1 aParrish, Colin R.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1836-66550 tJournal of veterinary diagnostic investigation.g2020 May, v. 32, no. 3 p.463-466dSAGE PublicationswJournal:jnl43656x1943-49367nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/10406387209122293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03040naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100001900112245016700131300001600298520165000314592002801964650001701992650001102009650002202020650001502042650001602057650002602073650001202099650002102111650001202132650001102144650001302155650001502168650001802183650001302201650000902214650001202223650001502235650001602250650001302266650001502279653001302294653001402307653001302321653001102334653001202345700001502357700002002372773012102392852000902513655001202522IND60128928120221123035431.0151124e201407  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012892812DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGarzón, M. J.10aEnvironmental Factors Related to the Abundance and Activity of Ochlerotatus albifasciatus (Diptera: Culicidae) in an Agricultural Landscape of Steppe Arid Climate  ap. 733-741.  aOchlerotatus albifasciatus (Macquart) is a flood water mosquito whose highest density has been found associated both with natural landscapes (prairies or grazing fields) in temperate and subtropical regions and with rainfall events. In the current study, we aimed to find out how the marked differences between environmental factors of agricultural landscape patches in a steppe arid region affect the relative abundance of this species. In wetland patches, the high activity of adults was closely associated with the flood irrigation system, suggesting that the agricultural activity contributes to the proliferation of this mosquito. The steppe patches would constitute an adverse environment reflected by the abrupt decrease in abundance. Multiple linear regression showed that some explanatory variables, such as wetland patches and moment of the day (midday), did not contribute significantly to the relative abundance variation. In contrast, temperature, wind, and cloud cover seemed to regulate the biting activity of females. Temperature affected the activity of mosquitoes in the steppe but seemed to have no effect in wetland patches, where the activity of mosquitoes was permanent and more stable against changes in temperature. In the steppe, which presents low levels of humidity, scarce vegetation, and greater wind exposure, the activity seemed to be unstable against small thermal variations. The variability of the relative abundance of Oc. albifasciatus in an agricultural landscape was widely explained by temperature in combination with the microenvironment type, wind speed, and cloud cover and indirectly by human activity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOchlerotatus 3aadults 3aagricultural land 3aarid zones 3acloud cover 3aenvironmental factors 3afemales 3aflood irrigation 3agrazing 3ahumans 3ahumidity 3alandscapes 3alinear models 3aprairies 3arain 3asteppes 3asubtropics 3atemperature 3awetlands 3awind speed 0aactivity 0aanthropic 0aflooding 0asteppe 0awetland1 aJensen, O.1 aSchweigmann, N.0 tJournal of medical entomology.g2014 July, v. 51, no. 4 p.733-741dEntomological Society of Americax0022-25857nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle01775naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001500147245007900162520076700241592002801008650001401036650001501050650001901065650002001084650001101104650001801115700001801133700001501151700002001166700001801186700001801204773012401222856008201346852000901428655001201437IND60757892920221119102608.0211125e20211026xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075789292DNAL7 a10.3390/pathogens101113832doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Nan 10aAdvances and Future Perspective on Detection Technology of Human Norovirus  aHuman norovirus (HuNoV) is a food-borne pathogen that causes acute gastroenteritis in people of all ages worldwide.

This paper reviewed the research progress on HuNoV detection, including immunological methods, molecular detection and biosensor technology. Immunological methods and molecular detection technologies are still widely used for HuNoV detection. Furthermore, biosensors will become an emerging developmental direction for the rapid detection of HuNoVs because of their high sensitivity, low cost, easy operation and suitability for onsite detection.  aPublisher supplied data 3aNorovirus 3abiosensors 3afood pathogens 3agastroenteritis 3ahumans 3arapid methods1 aPan, Guiying 1 aLiu, Ping 1 aRong, Shaofeng 1 aGao, Zhiyong 1 aLi, Qianqian 0 tPathogens.g2021 Oct. 26, v. 10, no. 11dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27146x2076-08177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/pathogens101113833Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03398naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001900139245021200158300001500370500001900385500002000404520178400424592002802208596004702236650001302283650001802296650002002314650001402334650002802348650001402376650002102390650001302411650001202424650002302436650001002459650004302469650001302512650002102525650000902546700001902555700002002574700001602594700001802610700005502628773013902683856007302822852000902895655001202904IND60725452120221117211453.0210125e202102  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072545212DNAL7 a10.1111/jhn.128222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSanders, L.

This randomised, cross‐over pilot trial evaluated the effect of consuming cooked, then chilled potatoes, a source of RS, compared to isoenergetic, carbohydrate (CHO)‐containing control foods, on insulin sensitivity and related markers. METHODS: Nineteen adults with body mass index 27.0‐39.9 kg m⁻² consumed 300 g day⁻¹ RS‐enriched potatoes (approximately two potatoes; ~18 g RS) or CHO‐based control foods, as part of lunch, evening and snack meals, over a 24‐h period. After an overnight fast, insulin sensitivity, CHO metabolism markers, free fatty acids, breath hydrogen levels and appetite were assessed for up to 5 h after the intake of a standard breakfast. The primary endpoint was insulin sensitivity, assessed with the Matsuda index. P < 0.05 (one‐sided) was considered statistically significant. RESULTS: Insulin sensitivity was not significantly different between the potato and control conditions. The potato intervention resulted in higher postprandial breath hydrogen (P = 0.037), lower postprandial free fatty acid concentrations (P = 0.039) and lower fasting plasma glucose (P = 0.043) compared to the control condition. Fullness ratings were significantly lower after potato versus control (P = 0.002). No other significant effects were observed; however, there was a trend toward lower fasting insulin (P = 0.077) in the potato versus the control condition.

These mitogenomes vary from 15,401 bp to 17,136 bp in size. The nucleotide compositions of Osmylinae mitogenomes are biased towards A/T. The gene arrangement of five mitogenomes is congruent with the putative ancestral pattern of the insects. Most of PCGs initiate with typical start codon ATN and terminate with TAA as the stop codon. All tRNA genes are folded into the typical cloverleaf secondary structure with an exception of tRNASᵉʳ⁽ᴬᴳᴺ⁾. The phylogenetic relationship was reconstructed by both maximum likelihood and Bayesian methods based on 13 PCGs and two rRNA genes. The sister group relationships between Osmylinae and the clade of Spilosmylinae and Protosmylinae were recovered as expected. The monophyly of Osmylinae was corroborated, but within the subfamily, three species (P. atomatus, P. zheanus, and Plethosmylus sp.) originally belonging to Plethosmylus (transferred to Osmylus by Winterton) were restored as a clade and sister to the clade of Osmylus. The current results implied that it is necessary to reassess the systematic status of Plethosmylus in the future.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBayesian theory 3aNeuroptera 3amitochondrial genome 3amonophyly 3astart codon 3astatistical analysis 3astop codon 0aOsmylinae 0aMitogenome 0aPhylogeny1 aWu, Yunfei1 aWang, Yongjie1 aLiu, Zhiqi0 tInternational journal of biological macromolecules.g2020 Dec. 01, v. 164 p.447-455dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12340x0141-81307nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2020.07.1503Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03801naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100006100153245011000214300001800324520223100342592002802573650001502601650002802616650002202644650001102666650001102677650001802688650001502706650001502721650001102736650002502747700001602772700001802788700002202806700005702828700006302885700001802948700001602966700001602982700006002998700003003058700002603088773012003114856008803234852000903322655001203331IND60782335120220707000000.0220707e20220613xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078233512DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.energyfuels.2c010062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSharma, Prabhakar1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7585-669310aRecent Advances in Machine Learning Research for Nanofluid-Based Heat Transfer in Renewable Energy System  ap. 6626-6658.  aNanofluids have gained significant popularity in the field of sustainable and renewable energy systems. The heat transfer capacity of the working fluid has a huge impact on the efficiency of the renewable energy system. The addition of a small amount of high thermal conductivity solid nanoparticles to a base fluid improves heat transfer. Even though a large amount of research data is available in the literature, some results are contradictory. Many influencing factors, as well as nonlinearity and refutations, make nanofluid research highly challenging and obstruct its potentially valuable uses. On the other hand, data-driven machine learning techniques would be very useful in nanofluid research for forecasting thermophysical features and heat transfer rate, identifying the most influential factors, and assessing the efficiencies of different renewable energy systems. The primary aim of this review study is to look at the features and applications of different machine learning techniques employed in the nanofluid-based renewable energy system, as well as to reveal new developments in machine learning research. A variety of modern machine learning algorithms for nanofluid-based heat transfer studies in renewable and sustainable energy systems are examined, along with their advantages and disadvantages. Artificial neural networks-based model prediction using contemporary commercial software is simple to develop and the most popular. The prognostic capacity may be further improved by combining a marine predator algorithm, genetic algorithm, swarm intelligence optimization, and other intelligent optimization approaches. In addition to the well-known neural networks and fuzzy- and gene-based machine learning techniques, newer ensemble machine learning techniques such as Boosted regression techniques, K-means, K-nearest neighbor (KNN), CatBoost, and XGBoost are gaining popularity due to their improved architectures and adaptabilities to diverse data types. The regularly used neural networks and fuzzy-based algorithms are mostly black-box methods, with the user having little or no understanding of how they function. This is the reason for concern, and ethical artificial intelligence is required.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3aartificial intelligence 3acomputer software 3aenergy 3aethics 3aheat transfer 3ananofluids 3aprediction 3aswarms 3athermal conductivity1 aSaid, Zafar1 aKumar, Anurag1 aNižetić, Sandro1 aPandey, Ashok1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1626-35291 aHoàng, Anh Tuấn,1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1767-80401 aHuang, Zuohua1 aAfzal, Asif1 aLi, Changhe1 aLê, Anh Tuấn,1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4609-03821 aNguyễn, Xuân Phương,1 aTrần, Việt Dũng,0 tEnergy & fuels.g2022 June 13, v. 36, no. 13 p.6626-6658dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23338x1520-50297nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.energyfuels.2c010063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03050naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245013500158300001800293520153400311592002801845650001901873650002901892650001101921650002301932650001601955650000901971650001401980650000801994650003102002650001902033650001002052650001402062650001102076650002802087650001702115650001002132650002402142650001602166653002402182653003102206653001402237653001802251700002102269700002502290773014602315856007402461852000902535655001202544IND60680453320221122224424.0200105e20160724xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068045332DNAL7 a10.1093/jee/tow1592doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAbbar, Salehe10aTime–Mortality Relationships to Control Tyrophagus putrescentiae (Sarcoptiformes: Acaridae) Exposed to High and Low Temperatures  ap. 2215-2220.  aTyrophagus putrescentiae (Schrank) (Sarcoptiformes: Acaridae) is a widely distributed pest species that is of significant economic importance for dry-cured country hams. Methyl bromide was used for decades in country ham plants to control this pest, but now this fumigant is recognized as an atmospheric ozone-depleting compound and will be phased out for all uses in the near future. Of various chemical and nonchemical alternatives to methyl bromide, extreme temperatures are viable and straightforward nonchemical methods to control pests. This study evaluated the efficacy of high and low temperatures on mortality of mold mite in the laboratory. Ten eggs and a mixture of 40 adults and nymphs were separately exposed to different high and low temperatures, ranging from +35 to 45 °C and from –20 to +5 °C, for several periods of time. Mortality was assessed after a recovery period for each life stage. Tyrophagus putrescentiae eggs were found to be more tolerant to both high and low temperatures than were the mobile stages. Results showed that high temperatures from 40-45 °C killed all mites within 4 to 1 d, respectively, while –10 °C or lower killed all mites in less than 1 d. Regression analyses of mortality data as a function of exposure predicted times for achieving desired levels of mite mortality. This study suggests that extreme temperature treatment can play an important role in integrated pest management programs for dry-cured ham as an alternative to methyl bromide or other chemical treatments.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSarcoptiformes 3aTyrophagus putrescentiae 3aadults 3achemical treatment 3acured meats 3aeggs 3afumigants 3aham 3aintegrated pest management 3amethyl bromide 3amites 3amortality 3anymphs 3aorganobromine compounds 3apest control 3apests 3aregression analysis 3atemperature 0aextreme temperature 0amethyl bromide alternative 0amold mite 0adry-cured ham1 aSchilling, M.

In contrast to drugs possessing a well-defined molecular mechanism of action, food-derived components act in subtle and pleiotropic ways by nature. Moreover, dietary compounds are mainly not intended to cure a disease but to prevent or beneficially affect situations when the physiology gets slightly out of homeostasis. By the example of a recent clinical pilot study, this paper illustrates an endeavor to find new strategies for the detection of health effects of flavonoids in the human vasculature. Integration of a meticulously selected cluster of relevant biomarkers eventually enabled the beneficial vascular health effects of flavonoids to be revealed. A critical appraisal of this approach for the future is provided.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiomarkers 3adrugs 3aflavonoids 3ahealth effects assessments 3ahumans 3amechanism of action 3anutrients 3aphysiology 2aClinical Trials as Topic 2aFlavonoidsxpharmacology 2aHumans 2aIntegrative Medicine 2aVascular Diseasesxdrug therapyxprevention & control. 0aflavonoids 0anutrients 0aantioxidants 0avascular health 0ainflammation 0aintegration 0abiomarkers 0arisk factors 0aend points 0ahealth index 0aclinical study1 aBast, Aalt0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2012 Sept. 12, v. 60, no. 36 p.8941-8946dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-51187nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fjf30003733Available from publisher's site 7aarticle01884naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002700140245012500167300001800292520085500310592002801165650001701193650001201210650001301222650002601235650001301261650001101274650001101285700003101296700002501327773012201352856007501474852000901549655001201558IND60636128520221118032531.0190505e20170130xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063612852DNAL7 a10.1039/c6ra28626g2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIanovska, Margaryta A.10aDevelopment of small-volume, microfluidic chaotic mixers for future application in two-dimensional liquid chromatography  ap. 9090-9099.  aWe report a microfluidic chaotic micromixer with staggered herringbone grooves having a geometry optimized for fast mobile-phase modification at the interface of a two-dimensional liquid chromatography system.

Natural colors are obtained from plants or microorganisms. Pigments produced by microorganisms have advantages over plant pigments, due to their ease of use and reliability. In the present study, a blue pigment producing actinomycete klmp33 was isolated from the Gulbarga region in India. The isolate was identified based on morphologic, microscopic, and biochemical characterization, and 16S rRNA sequencing. Phylogenetic analysis of the isolates showed a close relationship with Streptomyces coelicolor. Pigment produced by the isolate was analyzed using UV–visible spectroscopy, thin-layer chromatography, Fourier transform infrared and liquid chromatography/mass spectroscopy analysis, and was identified as γ actinorhodin. γ-Actinorhodin is used as a pH indicator which deviates from acid to non-acid. Moreover, it subrogates synthetic dye.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aStreptomyces coelicolor 3acarcinogenicity 3acolor 3afungi 3amass spectrometry 3apH 3aphylogeny 3aplant pigments 3aribosomal RNA 3athin layer chromatography 3aultraviolet-visible spectroscopy 3aIndia 0aStreptomyces coelicolor 0aBlue pigment 0aγ Actinorhodin 0apH indicator 0aSynthetic color1 aLingappa, K.0 tSaudi Journal of Biological Sciences.g2013 Apr., v. 20 p.163-168dElsevier B.V.x1319-562X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.sjbs.2013.01.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01953naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001300150245010300163300001600266520091400282592002801196650001501224650001101239650002401250650002901274653003301303653002301336653001201359653002101371700001301392700001901405773009701424856008501521852000901606655001201615IND60735762620221122220523.0220816e202108  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073576262DNAL7 a10.1016/j.renene.2021.04.0532doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMa, Qiyu12aA study on the influence of schooling patterns on the energy harvest of double undulatory airfoils  ap. 674-687.  aUndulatory flexible bodies can harvest energy from fluid flow under certain motion parameters. In order to reveal how schooling patterns affect the energy absorption efficiency of undulatory fishlike airfoils, several parameters have been considered, such as spacing and phase differences between the two airfoils. The object of this study is to employ NACA0012 airfoil as a two-dimensional simplified model, by means of numerical simulation, to investigate the influence of spacing and phase differences on energy harvest of double undulatory airfoils in different patterns. For convenience of analysis, the efficiency of energy harvest, also called energy absorption efficiency, has been calculated separately for each of the double airfoils. The results indicate that energy absorption efficiency, whether in a tandem or staggered pattern, will change significantly, compared with that in a single airfoil.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3aenergy 3amathematical models 3arenewable energy sources 0aEnergy absorption efficiency 0aSchooling patterns 0aSpacing 0aPhase difference1 aDing, Li1 aHuang, Diangui0 tRenewable energy.g2021 Aug., v. 174 p.674-687dElsevier LtdwJournal:11970x0960-14817nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.renene.2021.04.0533Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02677naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100003400142245013200176300001600308520101100324592002801335650002701363650002601390650002701416650001301443650002301456650002301479650002101502650000901523650001501532650001001547650003501557650001301592650001801605650001701623650001301640650001101653653001801664653002001682653003701702700002401739700002101763700003001784700002201814700002901836700003601865700003001901773013101931856007602062852000902138655001202147IND60682078320221120195758.0200124e20200123xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068207832DNAL7 a10.1653/024.102.04092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTeixeira Silva, Cinthia Luzia10aInteraction between Corn Genotypes with Bt Protein and Management Strategies for Spodoptera frugiperda (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae)  ap. 725-730.  aInsect pests, including caterpillars, cause losses in maize (Zea mays L.; Poaceae) which is one of the most important agricultural crops in the world.

The textural observations of the recovered samples and rim growth kinetic data revealed that the reaction is controlled by coupled grain boundary diffusion of MgO and grain coarsening in the perovskite reaction layer. Assuming a high diffusivity of O compared with Mg, the grain boundary diffusivity of Mg in the perovskite was determined to be δDgb ᴹᵍ[m³/s]=10⁻¹⁵.¹exp{−[176,000+(P−24)×3.8×10³]/RT}, which is ∼3–5 orders of magnitude faster than that of Si. We found that the bulk diffusivity of Mg in polycrystalline perovskite is affected by the grain boundary when we consider the possible grain sizes and temperatures in the lower mantle. Accordingly, grain boundary diffusion in perovskite may be an effective mechanism for chemical transportation of divalent cations in the lower mantle.  aPublisher supplied data 3acations 3adiffusivity 3amagnesium 3amagnesium oxide 3asilicon 3atemperature1 aNishihara, Yu1 aIrifune, Tetsuo0 tEarth and planetary science letters.g2013 Sept., v. 377-378 p.191-198dElsevier B.V.x0012-821X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.epsl.2013.06.0453Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03358naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002300144245013900167300001600306500001900322520195100341592002802292650001702320650001902337650001802356650001602374650001702390650001302407650002402420650001202444650001902456650002202475650003202497650001602529650001002545650000902555651001302564653002602577653002402603653001702627653001702644700002102661773011902682856007802801852000902879655001202888IND60708623720221121221152.0200828e20200901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070862372DNAL7 a10.2478/forj-2020-00102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aŠebeň, Vladimír10aTree height and species composition of young forest stands fifteen years after the large-scale wind disturbance in Tatra National Park  ap. 131-140.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aIn November 2004, the windstorm Alžbeta damaged over 12 thousand ha of forests in the High Tatra Mts. It was the largest wind disaster in the modern forestry history of Slovakia. The process of forest regeneration at the post-disturbance area has to be monitored together with the effectiveness of implemented forestry measures. Therefore, we focused on tree measurements at 90 monitoring plots (MP) in 1 × 1 km net placed in the post-disturbance area in the Tatra National Park. We recorded tree species, number of trees (density) and tree heights. Besides that, stem diameters of trees with breast height diameter over 7 cm were measured. The field work was performed in the growing season of 2019, i.e. about 15 years after the wind disturbance. In total, 20 tree species, 15 broadleaves and 5 coniferous ones, were recorded at MP. The most frequent (28.9% of all trees) species was Norway spruce followed by silver birch (18.6%), rowan (16.9%) and goat willow (15.2%). Four species, i.e. European larch, wild cherry, grey alder and common alder contributed to the total number of trees between 1.8 and 4.8% each. Share of all other species together was about 5%. Tree height frequency was left-sided for the whole sampling set (all species together), as well as for individual species. Most of young trees were less than 1m high, but some of them exceeded 10 m. Further, tree density of over 100 individuals per are (100 m²) was found at 1/3 of all MPs. As many as 25% of MPs were characterized with tree densities between 61 and 90 individuals. At 23% of MPs, the number of trees was up to 30 individuals per are, and 20% of MPs had between 31 and 60 small trees per are. The results suggested that the post-disturbance forest stands in the High Tatras would be more resistant to wind storms and very probably also to bark beetles after reaching maturity than those, which were destructed and declined at the beginning of 21ˢᵗ century.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAlnus incana 3aBetula pendula 3aLarix decidua 3aPicea abies 3aSalix caprea 3acherries 3aforest regeneration 3aforests 3anational parks 3aspecies diversity 3atree and stand measurements 3atree height 3atrees 3awind 3aSlovakia 0apost-disturbance area 0ayoung forest stands 0atree density 0atree species1 aKonôpka, Bohdan0 tCentral European Forestry Journal.g2020 Sept. 01, v. 66, no. 3 p.131-140dSciendowJournal:23614x2454-03587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2478/forj-2020-00103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01972naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002500149245008300174300001300257520098600270592002801256653003101284653001401315653001301329653003401342700002501376700002001401700002501421700001901446700002401465773006501489856008301554852000901637655001201646IND60587112820221119232138.0171214s2017    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058711282DNAL7 a10.1016/j.onano.2016.11.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSharma, Sudhir Kumar10aProduction of nanostructured molecular liquids by supercritical CO2 processing  ap. 9-18.  aStable molecular clusters of ibuprofen and naproxen were prepared in dry ice, by supersonic jet expansion of their supercritical CO2 drug formulations into a liquid nitrogen cooled collection vessel, with up to 80% yield.

We have practically little knowledge of facilitation effects in different intercropping systems and their importance in creating soil legacies that can indirectly affect the succeeding crop in a crop rotation through plant-soil feedback (PSF) effects. METHODS: To test this, we used a two-phased field experiment where we combined intercropping and crop rotation. During intercropping, we grew maize, faba bean, and lupine in monocultures or two-species crop combinations. The following season, we grew winter barley on the soil previously used for intercropping to test PSF effects under field conditions. RESULTS: We found evidence for facilitative effects on aboveground biomass production that were species-specific with faba bean and maize biomass benefitting when intercropped compared to their expected biomasses in monocultures. Lupine, in contrast, performed best in monocultures. After the intercropping phase, total soil mineral nitrogen was higher in legume monocultures creating soil legacies but this did not affect soil microbial parameters and barley biomass production in the follow-up rotation phase. CONCLUSIONS: We found support for species-specific positive and negative interactions in intercropping. Our results also demonstrated that soil legacies play no significant role under moderately high nutrient environments.  aPublisher supplied data  a031B0508HcBundesministerium für Bildung und Forschung  a031B0508FcBundesministerium für Bildung und Forschung 3aLupinus 3aaboveground biomass 3abiomass production 3acorn 3acrop rotation 3afaba beans 3afield experimentation 3anitrogen 3asoil 3asoil minerals 3asoil-plant interactions 3awinter barley1 aRosinger, Christoph1 aChen, Hao1 aProtic, Siobhan1 aBonkowski, Michael1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2656-11831 aTemperton, Vicky M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0543-45210 tPlant and soil.g2021 Oct., v. 467, no. 1-2 p.405-419dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:jnl49373x0032-079X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11104-021-05104-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02369naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002900148245011500177300001600292520140200308592002801710650001801738650001601756650001101772651001801783700001601801700002901817773010701846856008201953990002302035852000902058655001202067IND60095273020221123031622.0141104e201309  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009527302DNAL7 a10.1016/j.epsl.2013.06.0432doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTabares-Rodenas, Pascual10aCosmic wabi-sabi: Tell-tale morphological imperfections in impact crater shapes revealed by numerical analysis  ap. 211-217.  aGeomorphological features result from a combination of factors such as material strength, structure, and the forces of nature. An impact crater is a good example. In an ideally simple situation (e.g., a vertical impact of a spherical object into a homogeneous target), the resulting crater will obtain a perfectly circular shape. Any deviation from the perfect circle can reveal important information about the cratering process, target properties, and even the surficial environment in which the impact occurred (e.g. the presence of an atmosphere). However, irregularities in the crater shape are not always obvious. What appears to be a perfect circle may hide subtle information undetectable to the naked eye. Here we present a new method of numerical aspect classification that allows even the slightest morphological irregularities to be detected. Our method is based on a numerical analysis of dip directions of segments within a digital terrain model (DTM) of the crater rim. We show the successful application of our method on a crater with well-known polygonal shape (Meteor Crater, USA) as well as two apparently circular Martian impact craters. Our Crater Aspect Classification (CAC) can be applied on any other micro- to mega-scale structures for which a DTM can be produced, thus allowing applications to fields of science and technology within and beyond the scope of geomorphology.  aPublisher supplied data 3ageomorphology 3amethodology 3amodels 3aUnited States1 aOrmö, Jens1 aKing, David T., Jr.cJr.0 tEarth and planetary science letters.g2013 Sept., v. 377-378 p.211-217dElsevier B.V.x0012-821X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.epsl.2013.06.0433Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02867naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100001600166245008800182300001600270520139400286592002801680650004301708650001601751650002001767650001601787650000901803650002601812650001301838650004201851650003801893650003801931650004301969653001102012653002102023653002202044653001102066653003802077700001802115700001502133700001102148700001602159700002002175773010002195856008102295852000902376655001202385IND60113430120221122064244.0161024e20131120xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011343012DNAL7 a242386102pmid7 a10.1016/j.jgg.2013.08.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKong, Danyu10aSequence Diversity and Enzyme Activity of Ferric-Chelate Reductase LeFRO1 in Tomato  ap. 565-573.  aFerric-chelate reductase which functions in the reduction of ferric to ferrous iron on root surface is a critical protein for iron homeostasis in strategy I plants. LeFRO1 is a major ferric-chelate reductase involved in iron uptake in tomato. To identify the natural variations of LeFRO1 and to assess their effect on the ferric-chelate reductase activity, we cloned the coding sequences of LeFRO1 from 16 tomato varieties collected from different regions, and detected three types of LeFRO1 (LeFRO1MM, LeFRO1Ailsa and LeFRO1Monita) with five amino acid variations at the positions 21, 24, 112, 195 and 582. Enzyme activity assay revealed that the three types of LeFRO1 possessed different ferric-chelate reductase activity (LeFRO1Ailsa > LeFRO1MM > LeFRO1Monita). The 112th amino acid residue Ala of LeFRO1 is critical for maintaining the high activity of ferric-chelate reductase, because modification of this amino acid resulted in a significant reduction of enzyme activity. Further, we showed that the combination of the amino acid residue Ile at the site 24 with Lys at the site 582 played a positive role in the enzyme activity of LeFRO1. In conclusion, the findings are helpful to understand the natural adaptation mechanisms of plants to iron-limiting stress, and may provide new knowledge to select and manipulate LeFRO1 for improving the iron deficiency tolerance in tomato.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSolanum lycopersicum var. lycopersicum 3aamino acids 3aenzyme activity 3ahomeostasis 3airon 3anutrient deficiencies 3atomatoes 2aFMN Reductasexchemistryxmetabolism. 2aGene Expression Regulation, Plant 2aSolanum lycopersicumxenzymology. 2aPlant Proteinsxchemistryxmetabolism. 0aTomato 0aIron homeostasis 0aNatural variation 0aLeFRO1 0aFerric-chelate reductase activity1 aChen, Chunlin1 aWu, Huilan1 aLi, Ye1 aLi, Junming1 aLing, Hong-Qing0 tJournal of genetics and genomics.g2013 Nov. 20, v. 40 p.565-573dElsevier Ltdx1673-85277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jgg.2013.08.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02120naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001900152245011000171300001400281520078500295592002801080650001601108650003701124650001501161650001501176650002301191650002101214650001701235650001801252650001401270650001101284700001801295700001901313700001701332700002001349700001801369700001901387700001901406700001901425773011201444856008601556990002301642852000901665655001201674IND60113195320221120140828.0141111e20111101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011319532DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jelechem.2011.03.0232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJeon, Tae-Yeol10aEnhanced activity of Pt-based electrocatalysts for oxygen reduction via a selective Pt deposition process  ap. 70-79.  aCarbon-supported Pt nanoparticles with various loading of Pt are prepared by a novel seed-mediated growth method using hydroquinone (HQ) assisted selective deposition.

However, relatively few investigations have focussed on the identification of natural variation in comparable modern populations, particularly within the Australian context. In this paper, we present the first modern isotopic reference dataset for Tasmanian bare-nosed wombat teeth (Vombatus ursinus tasmaniensis).Samples for δ13Cbioapatite and δ18Obioapatite measurements were recovered sequentially at sub-monthly resolution from all tooth types. δ13Cbioapatite showed little variation within a seasonal sinusoidal pattern within the sample set (n = 24 wombats; 35 teeth) due to the homogeneous C3 distribution of plants in Tasmania. In contrast, δ18Obioapatite profiles varied seasonally, representing time periods of between 0.9 and 2.1 years in 95% of the sample. Significant differences between tooth types were found from intra-individual to inter-regional scales for both dental growth rates and isotopic values. The accuracy of season-of-death assessments differed across the island; those in eastern Tasmania were accurate in all instances whereas those in the west showed substantial inaccuracies. We suggest that this may be due to the elodont form of wombat dentition and the ecologically influenced seasonally varied diet in western Tasmania. As the rate of dental growth is positively correlated with the proportion of coarse vegetation within the diet, this seasonal variation is therefore likely to change how annual isotopic signals are incorporated into the enamel. These results highlight the need to understand the degree of species-specific isotopic variation at a range of scales before applying this technique to archaeological or palaeontological assemblages.  aPublisher supplied data 3aVombatus ursinus 3acarbon 3adata collection 3adiet 3aenamel 3afossils 3ahumans 3aoxygen 3apaleoecology 3aseasonal variation 3astable isotopes 3atooth enamel 3avegetation 3aTasmania 0aModern reference data 0aδ13C 0aδ18O 0aMarsupial 0aAustralia1 aTowers, Jacqueline1 aGagan, Michael K.1 aCosgrove, Richard1 aSmith, Colin0 tPalaeogeography, palaeoclimatology, palaeoecology.g2019 June 01, v. 523 p.97-115dElsevier B.V.wJournal:2694x0031-01827nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.palaeo.2019.03.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03680naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001300147245009500160520198800255592002802243650003402271650001402305650002002319650002702339650001902366650001602385650001502401650002202416650002602438650002202464650001802486650002102504650001302525650001502538650002202553650001702575650001802592650002002610650001302630653002402643653001802667653002502685653003202710700001502742700001602757700001302773700001802786700001602804700001702820700001302837700001602850700001702866773011602883856008202999852000903081655001203090IND60654458620221122160928.0190801e20191028xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065445862DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jep.2019.1121012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWu, Yali10aTranscriptomic-proteomics-anticoagulant bioactivity integrated study of Pheretima guillemi  aEarthworms, a type of animal drugs from traditional Chinese medicine, have been used to treat coagulation for many years with less adverse effects and similar anticoagulant effects compared to the commonly used anticoagulants. There are four species of earthworms recorded in Chinese Pharmacopoeia, while few of them were studied and deficient information were involved in the NCBI and UniProt earthworm protein database. We have adopted a transcriptomic-proteomics-anticoagulant bioactivity integrated approach to investigate a seldom-studied Chinese Pharmacopoeia recorded species, Pheretima guillelmi.In the present study, we aimed to reveal the anticoagulant bioactivity of Pheretima guillelmi, and identify its functional proteins via LC-MS/MS-transcriptome cross identification.With the aid of fibrinogen-thrombin time assay, Pheretima guillelmi was found to possess strong anticoagulant activity, and the bioactivity was quite stable under 30–50 °C and near-neutral conditions. A comprehensive non-reference transcriptome assembly of P. guillelmi was first established to supplement the currently inadequate earthworm protein database and to illustrate the active proteins. Illumina RNA sequencing generated 25,931,175 of clean reads with over 97% high-quality clean reads (Q20) and assembled an average of 133,228 of transcript and 106,717 of unigenes. A total of 11,259 coding sequences were predicted via ESTScan (3.0.3). The P. guillelmi unigenes were searched and annotated against public database. The bioactive proteins in P. guillelmi were with broad distribution of molecular weight. With bottom-up proteomics analysis, ten proteins were identified against UniProt and NCBI earthworm database; and 31 proteins with high-confidence were matched against transcriptomic established P. guillelmi database.This study illuminated the therapeutic potency of P. guillelmi for antithrombus and provide a new strategy to investigate animal drugs of Chinese materia medica.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOriental traditional medicine 3aPheretima 3aadverse effects 3aanticoagulant activity 3aanticoagulants 3acoagulation 3aearthworms 3ahomeopathic drugs 3aliquid chromatography 3amass spectrometry 3amessenger RNA 3amolecular weight 3aproteins 3aproteomics 3asequence analysis 3atherapeutics 3atranscriptome 3atranscriptomics 3aunigenes 0aPheretima guillelmi 0aAnticoagulant 0aBottom-up proteomics 0aNon-reference transcriptome1 aMa, Yunnan1 aHu, Shaonan1 aZhao, Bo1 aYang, Wanqing1 aSun, Zongxi1 aZhu, Baochen1 aLu, Yang1 aLi, Pengyue1 aDu, Shouying0 tJournal of ethnopharmacology.g2019 Oct. 28, v. 243 p.112101-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl30651x0378-87417nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jep.2019.1121013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01383naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001800144245008400162300001600246500002000262520050100282592002800783650002600811650001300837650002600850650000900876773013300885856007801018852000901096655001201105IND60576987420171026000000.0170806e201708  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057698742DNAL7 a10.1002/jpln.2017001842doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNunan, Naoise14aThe microbial habitat in soil: Scale, heterogeneity and functional consequences  ap. 425-429.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe microbial habitat is rarely studied in soil microbial ecology even though microbial cells are exposed and adapt to their local environmental conditions.

In plants, H₂S is synthesized via cysteine degradation catalyzed by D‐/L‐cysteine desulfhydrase (D‐/L‐CDes). AtD‐/L‐CDes::GUS transgenic Arabidopsis thaliana (L.) Heynh. plants were generated and used to investigate gene expression patterns, and results showed that AtD‐/L‐CDes can be expressed in guard cells. We also determined the subcellular localization of AtD‐/L‐CDes using transgenic plants of AtD‐/L‐CDes::GFP, and the results showed that AtD‐CDes and AtL‐CDes are located in the chloroplast and in the cytoplasm, respectively. The transcript levels of AtD‐CDes and AtL‐CDes were affected by the chemicals that cause stomatal closure. Among these factors, ACC, a precursor of ethylene, has the most significant effect, which indicates that the H₂S generated from D‐/L‐CDes may play an important role in ethylene‐induced stomatal closure. Meanwhile, H₂S synthetic inhibitors significantly inhibited ethylene‐induced stomatal closure in Arabidopsis. Ethylene treatment caused an increase of H₂S production and of AtD‐/L‐CDes activity in Arabidopsis leaves. AtD‐/L‐CDes over‐expressing plants exhibited enhanced induction of stomatal closure compared to the wild‐type after ethylene treatment; however, the effect was not observed in the Atd‐cdes and Atl‐cdes mutants.

There is precedent for evolution of glyphosate resistance in similar situations, raising concerns over the sustainability of glyphosate use in the UK. We used dose–response experiments to examine variation in glyphosate sensitivity amongst 40 field‐collected A. myosuroides populations. No populations were resistant to glyphosate, but ED₉₀ values ranged between 354 and 610 g a.i. ha⁻¹. Five populations had ED₉₀ values significantly higher than the unexposed control population collected from a site at Rothamsted Research with no previous glyphosate exposure. Recurrent selection experiments were performed to determine whether variation in glyphosate sensitivity had a heritable basis. Following two rounds of selection, five of six field populations evolved significantly reduced sensitivity to glyphosate, with R/S ratios, based on estimated ED₅₀ values, ranging from 1.2 to 1.5. These results confirm that there is a heritable basis to variation in glyphosate sensitivity. The response to selection was modest. Evolved populations were not highly resistant to glyphosate, although some twice‐selected individuals survived recommended field rates. These results do not represent definitive proof of the potential of A. myosuroides to evolve glyphosate resistance, although they do indicate caution is needed when considering the sustainability of increased glyphosate use to control this herbicide resistance‐prone species.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aAlopecurus myosuroides 3adose response 3aevolution 3aglyphosate 3aherbicide resistance 3aherbicide-resistant weeds 3arecurrent selection 3aUnited Kingdom1 aNeve, P0 tWeed research.g2017 Oct., v. 57, no. 5 p.323-332dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltdx0043-17377nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/wre.122643Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01807naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002700147245012100174300001600295520075300311592002801064650002701092650000901119650002601128650002001154650001501174650001201189650001001201651001401211651001401225700002201239773011801261856008101379852000901460655001201469IND60548248120221116171427.0160903e201109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054824812DNAL7 a10.1007/s11676-011-0114-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHathurusingha, Subhash10aVariations in bark thickness and sapwood density of Calophyllum inophyllum provenances in Australia and in Sri Lanka  ap. 399-402.  aSapwood density and bark thickness of Calophyllum inophyllum L. (a multipurpose durable timber species) were studied in various locations in Northern Australia and in Sri Lanka. Measurements were taken non-destructively by using core sampling and bark gauge. From each provenance, 4–15 mature trees having girth at breast height over bark (GBHOB) at 100–150 cm were selected on the basis of the population size. Significant (p<0.05) hemispheric and provenance variations in bark thickness were found. Variations in the bark thickness are influenced by environmental variables. Variations in sapwood density were less pronounced compared to that of bark thickness. Variations in sapwood density are likely to be governed by genotypic variations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCalophyllum inophyllum 3abark 3aenvironmental factors 3apopulation size 3aprovenance 3asapwood 3atrees 3aAustralia 3aSri Lanka1 aAshwath, Nanjappa0 tJournal of forestry research.g2011 Sept., v. 22, no. 3 p.399-402dNortheast Forestry Universityx1007-662X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11676-011-0114-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01899naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001600152245009300168300001400261520081500275592002801090650002301118650002101141650001701162650000901179650001601188650002101204650001801225650002301243650003401266700001901300773011201319856008601431990002301517852000901540655001201549IND60113195820221120150705.0141111e20111101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011319582DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jelechem.2011.01.0462doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMa, Xinzhou10aLocally enhanced cathodoluminescence of electrochemically fabricated gold nanostructures  ap. 12-16.  aThree dimensional structures of Au with submicron sizes and high aspect ratios were fabricated by electrochemical micromachining with short voltage pulses.

Careful adjustment of the machining parameters like rest potentials of tool and workpiece and pulse amplitude allowed for the routine fabrication of Au microstructures. The optical properties of such structures were investigated by measuring their cathodoluminescence upon electron irradiation in a scanning electron microscope.

However, existing products are not biodegradable. Conventional plastics, manufactured from fossil fuels, not only consume non-renewable and finite resources, but also impact heavily on waste disposal. For this reason, a new multilayer film has been developed in the Multibio Project for the production of food packaging. In this paper, the environmental impacts of the new biodegradable multilayer film—based on modified starch and polylactic acid (PLA)—and those of the conventional multilayer film—based on PP and PA6—are quantified in the categories of climate change, fossil fuel depletion, acidification and eutrophication. Conventional multilayer film has a 90% higher impact than the Multibio multilayer film. The main difference between the LCA presented and the cited literature is the inventory data obtained in the phase of polymer processing to obtain multilayer film, and the assessment of the disposal phase of the multilayer film wastes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacidification 3abiodegradability 3aclimate change 3aenvironmental assessment 3aenvironmental impact 3aeutrophication 3afood packaging 3afossil fuels 3alife cycle assessment 3amodified starch 3aplastics 3apolylactic acid 3awaste disposal 3awastes1 aMartínez, Pilar,1 aMulet, Elena1 aGonzález, Rosa,1 aLópez-Mesa, Belinda,1 aFowler, Paul1 aFang, J.

Recently, a RICE6K SNP array has been developed based on the Illumina Bead Array platform and Infinium SNP assay technology for genome-wide evaluation of allelic variations and breeding applications. In this study, the RICE6K SNP array was used to genotype a recombinant inbred line (RIL) population derived from the cross between the indica variety, Zhenshan 97, and the japonica variety, Xizang 2. A total of 3324 SNP markers of high quality were identified and were grouped into 1495 recombination bins in the RIL population. A high-density linkage map, consisting of the 1495 bins, was developed, covering 1591.2 cM and with average length of 1.1 cM per bin. Segregation distortions were observed in 24 regions of the 11 chromosomes in the RILs. One half of the distorted regions contained fertility genes that had been previously reported. A total of 23 QTLs were identified for yield. Seven QTLs were firstly detected in this study. The positive alleles from about half of the identified QTLs came from Zhenshan 97 and they had lower phenotypic values than Xizang 2. This indicated that favorable alleles for breeding were dispersed in both parents and pyramiding favorable alleles could develop elite lines. The size of the mapping population for QTL analysis using high throughput SNP genotyping platform is also discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalleles 3abreeding 3achromosome mapping 3achromosomes 3agenotype 3agenotyping 3agrain yield 3ainbred lines 3aparents 3aquantitative trait loci 3arice 3asegregation distortion 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism 2aGenetic Linkagexgenetics 2aGenome, Plantxgenetics 2aGenomics 2aInbreeding 2aOligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis. 2aOryzaxgeneticsxgrowth & development. 2aPhenotype 2aPolymorphism, Single Nucleotide 2aQuantitative Trait Locixgenetics 0aRILs 0aRICE6K SNP array 0aBin map 0aSegregation distortion 0aQTL1 aHan, Zhongmin1 aYu, Huihui1 aZhan, Wei1 aXie, Weibo1 aChen, Xun1 aZhao, Hu1 aZhou, Fasong1 aXing, Yongzhong0 tJournal of genetics and genomics.g2013 Dec. 20, v. 40 p.629-638dElsevier Ltdx1673-85277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jgg.2013.06.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03521naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245016300165300001600328520200000344592002802344650002402372650001802396650002102414650001002435650001402445650001402459650001202473650001202485650001302497650002002510650002102530650001102551650001202562650001402574650001602588650002202604650002902626650002402655650001302679650002002692650002502712650001402737650001602751651001002767700001802777773011802795856008102913852000902994655001203003IND60548248320221116171109.0160903e201109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054824832DNAL7 a10.1007/s11676-011-0115-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVenugopal, N.10aRelationship between age, size, fecundity and climatic factors in Panax wangianus an endangered medicinal plant in the sacred grove forest of North-East India  ap. 427-435.  aPanax wangianus (Syn. Panax pseudoginseng) S. C. Sun (Araliaceae) is a critically endangered, medicinal plant of North-East India. The objective of this study was to determine how plant size affects flowering phenology and to evaluate the effect of climatic factors on flowering, fruiting and seed production. Data on vegetative and reproductive characters were monitored from 2016 individuals of Panax wangianus population in Law Lyngdoh, Smit sacred grove in Nongkrem, Shillong, India. Leaflet area was measured by a planimeter. Size variables of both vegetative and reproductive traits in different age classes were measured. Climatic factors were recorded from 2007 to 2009. Age was recorded by counting the number of bud scale scars on the rhizome. Light intensity and relative humidity were measured using a photometer, LiCor Model LI-189 and thermohygrometer respectively. Different climatic variables are correlated with vegetative and reproductive phenological events. Statistical analysis revealed that a strong positive correlation was observed between the age versus vegetative and reproductive characters, except 1%–2% plants showed neoteny. Morphological variations were observed in natural conditions on the basis of the number of prong and carpellate conditions. Phenological status revealed that most of the individuals of the age class 35–50 years and above 50 years contributed the most to flowering, fruiting and seed production. Age class was significant to predict the size of the plant and its reproductive capacity. Climatic factors such as temperature, precipitation and relative humidity show synergistic effect on both the vegetative and reproductive phases in Panax wangianus in the undisturbed Nongkrem sacred grove. The color of flowers of P. wangianus also varied depending upon the sunlight intensity. Therefore, in the view of conservation and management, the age class of 35–50 years and above 50 years is the most important for population sustainability.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPanax pseudoginseng 3aage structure 3aclimatic factors 3acolor 3afecundity 3aflowering 3aflowers 3aforests 3afruiting 3alight intensity 3amedicinal plants 3amodels 3aneoteny 3aphenology 3aphotometers 3arelative humidity 3areproductive performance 3areproductive traits 3arhizomes 3asolar radiation 3astatistical analysis 3asynergism 3atemperature 3aIndia1 aAhuja, Preeti0 tJournal of forestry research.g2011 Sept., v. 22, no. 3 p.427-435dNortheast Forestry Universityx1007-662X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11676-011-0115-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02495naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245010900168520136900277592002801646650001301674650002701687650002801714650002001742650002201762650001101784650001601795653001701811653004301828653002301871700001501894700001401909700001501923773010001938856008602038852000902124655001202133IND60654458920221122164454.0190725e201909  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065445892DNAL7 a10.1016/j.firesaf.2019.1028522doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Xuzheng10aInspection, materials testing and field testing of a prestressed concrete box bridge after fire exposure  aThis paper presents inspection, materials testing, field testing and parametric finite element analysis of a prestressed concrete box girder bridge after fire exposure. A detailed inspection of the fire-exposed bridge was performed through visual checking, photo examinations, and hammer detection. Samples of the concrete cores and reinforcing bars were tested; the residual strengths of the building materials (concrete, reinforcing bars and prestressed strands) were estimated. Furthermore, the temperatures at various depths were estimated. The data from field studies were used to validate finite element models. The structural behaviors of the original bridge prior to fire exposure were obtained via instrumentation from a reference bridge not exposed to fire. The static proof load test deflection results indicate that the stiffness decreased by approximately 23% after fire exposure and no longer satisfied the design requirement. The measured fundamental frequency of the fire-exposed span was approximately 97% of that of the original span and the theoretical fundamental frequency, indicating that the fire had little influence on the frequency of the concrete structure. Based on this work, the repair requirements of the bridge were determined and undertaken, and the repairs were proven to be effective via a field loading test after strengthening.  aPublisher supplied data 3aconcrete 3aconstruction materials 3afinite element analysis 3ainstrumentation 3amaterials testing 3amodels 3atemperature 0aBridge fires 0aPrestressed concrete box girder bridge 0aField loading test1 aYu, Chenxi1 aQuan, Wei1 aMa, Yukun,0 tFire safety journal.g2019 Sept., v. 108 p.102852-dElsevier LtdwJournal:3526x0379-71127nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.firesaf.2019.1028523Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01902naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245008000166300001600246520096400262592002801226650002901254650002001283650002301303650001501326650001001341700002301351700002601374773010901400856008201509852000901591655001201600IND60113430720221120094345.0141111e201212  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011343072DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jher.2012.05.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKumar, Ashish10aFlow structure and scour around circular compound bridge piers – A review  ap. 251-265.  aLarge amount of literature is presently available on the topic of scour around uniform piers and its control. However, relatively fewer studies have been carried out so far on the topic of flow field and scour around compound piers. The state of art on the topic of flow structure and scour around circular compound piers is presented herein. The available literature reveals that variations in foundation and pier geometry significantly affect the maximum depth of scour and its temporal variation. In case of compound piers the scour depth is highly sensitive to the change in elevation of the top surface of the foundation well. As compared to uniform piers, a reduction is observed in maximum depth of scour around compound pier when the top surface of the well is kept below the general level of river bed. These observations however are yet to be quantified. Results from an experimental study on flow field around the compound piers are also presented.  aPublisher supplied data 3abridges (infrastructure) 3astream channels 3atemporal variation 3awater flow 3awells1 aKothyari, Umesh C.1 aRanga Raju, Kittur G.0 tJournal of hydro-environment research.g2012 Dec., v. 6, no. 4 p.251-265dElsevier B.V.x1570-64437nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jher.2012.05.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03079naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006600148245012100214300001600335520167900351592002802030596008602058596010302144650002602247650001502273650002002288650002202308650001702330650001002347700006502357700006202422700002502484773012802509856008302637852000902720655001202729IND60753129520221118043113.0220814e202110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075312952DNAL7 a10.1007/s11104-021-05088-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPiazza, Maria-Victoria1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6185-419510aLong-term impact of domestic ungulates versus the local controls of the litter decomposition process in arid steppes  ap. 483-497.  aAIMS: Soil processes in arid ecosystems are strongly controlled by resource scarcity. Grazing intensification can induce changes in ecosystem processes through multiple pathways, adding new constraints to those of local conditions. We focus on grazing-induced changes in litter traits and soil environment that may affect litter decomposition and N dynamics in temperate grass-shrub steppes. METHODS: We performed three litterbag decomposition experiments to evaluate: i) the effect of litter traits in a common garden (ex situ), ii) the effect of soil environment using a foreign common litter substrate (in situ), and iii) the interactive effects of litter traits and soil environment (grazed vs. exclosure communities, reciprocal transplants in situ). Field experiments were replicated in three blocks with paired plots under a long-term exclosure (> 25 years) and under year-round sheep grazing. Local litter included mixtures of species of grasses and shrubs, separately. RESULTS: Grazing exclusion did not alter litter decomposition rates, either through changes in litter traits or in soil environment. Nevertheless, N released during grass litter decomposition was 286% higher in exclosures than in grazing communities. The difference was associated to changes in litter C:N ratio. The effects were maintained when results were integrated to the entire litter community. CONCLUSION: Our study suggests that litter decomposition rates in arid steppes are strongly controlled by local drivers. Ungulate grazing does not have an important influence on litter mass loss, but it can exert a strong control on N flux during decomposition, by changing grass litter traits.  aPublisher supplied data  aBID-PICT Redes 2007-0284cFondo para la Investigación Científica y Tecnológica  adoctoral and postdoctoral fellowshipcConsejo Nacional de Investigaciones Científicas y Técnicas 3acarbon nitrogen ratio 3aecosystems 3aedaphic factors 3along term effects 3aplant litter 3asheep1 aOñatibia, Gastón R.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2329-66011 aAguiar, Martín R.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1213-40281 aChaneton, Enrique J.0 tPlant and soil.g2021 Oct., v. 467, no. 1-2 p.483-497dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:jnl49373x0032-079X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11104-021-05088-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03810naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245014100170300001600311520214000327592002802467650001102495650001602506650002502522650001502547650002802562650001802590650001102608650001502619650001702634650001302651650001002664650001502674650001802689650001802707650002202725650001502747650001202762651001702774653001802791653003002809653002502839653002702864653002002891700001602911700001902927700001802946700001702964700001902981700001703000700001603017773010403033856008603137852000903223655001203232IND60526486320221118042907.0190408e201609  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052648632DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecoleng.2016.05.0372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Guangming10aGIS-mapping spatial distribution of soil salinity for Eco-restoring the Yellow River Delta in combination with Electromagnetic Induction  ap. 306-314.  aSoil salinization is one of serious ecological problems around the world, which seriously restricts the stability of ecosystem and the economic development of agriculture. Mapping and monitoring spatial distribution of soil salinity is important for management of ecology and agriculture. This study was carried out to explore the spatial distribution of soil salinity in the Yellow River Delta using the portable device EM38-MK2 with geostatistical analysis. Apparent soil electrical conductivities were measured under four kinds of measurement modes (0.5H, 0.5V, 1.0H and 1.0V, respectively). The results revealed that electrical conductivity of 1:5 soil to water extract (ECe) varied from 0.965 to 1.872dSm−1 for all sampled soil profiles, and the salinity of topsoil was the highest, which indicated that soil soluble salts accumulated to the surface. The salinity in the top layer showed strong spatial variability while salinities of other layers were moderate. Soil salinity displayed a significant zonal distribution, gradually decreasing with the increase of distance to the coastline. The regions with high ECa values were located in the north and the east of the study area, whereas regions with low ECa values were located in the south and the west parts. The correlation coefficient showed that salinities of adjacent two soil layers reached a significant level of 0.01, and gradually decreased with increasing soil depth. The linear interpretation models with ECa as independent variables and ECe as dependent variables for each depth were with R2 between 0.828 and 0.919. The interpretation models, taking ECa and ECe of 0- 15cm depth as independent variables, and ECe of each layer in 15–100cm depth as dependent variables, were with higher R2 between 0.930 and 0.953. The mean error (ME) showed that there was small positive deviation in 40–100cm whereas a high positive deviation in the topsoil (0–40cm). The scatter plots also indicated that the models had better accuracy of salinity estimation in the top soil layers (0–80cm). The results provides solid basis for eco-restoring in the Yellow River delta.  aPublisher supplied data 3acoasts 3acorrelation 3aeconomic development 3aecosystems 3aelectrical conductivity 3ageostatistics 3amodels 3amonitoring 3ariver deltas 3asalinity 3asalts 3asoil depth 3asoil profiles 3asoil salinity 3asoil salinization 3asoil water 3atopsoil 3aYellow River 0aSoil salinity 0aElectromagnetic induction 0aSpatial distribution 0aThe Yellow River delta 0aEco-restoration1 aLi, Jinbiao1 aZhang, Xuechen1 aWang, Xiuping1 aLv, Zhenzhen1 aYang, Jingsong1 aShao, Hongbo1 aYu, Shipeng0 tEcological engineering.g2016 Sept., v. 94 p.306-314dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11630x0925-85747nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoleng.2016.05.0373Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02090naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002200148245006000170300001600230520114700246592002801393650001401421650001301435650001101448650000901459651001901468700002801487700002701515700003401542773010901576856008201685852000901767655001201776IND60113430920221120094354.0141111e201212  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011343092DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jher.2012.05.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYapa, Poojitha D.10aHow does oil and gas behave when released in deepwater?  ap. 275-285.  aDeepwater oil and gas releases have come to greater attention of the scientists as well as general public in the recent past, especially after the Deepwater Horizon spill in Gulf of Mexico in 2010. In this short paper we show the general behavior of an oil and gas spill in deepwater. A model, CDOG, developed by Zheng et al. (2003) and had undergone successive improvements is used for the simulations to illustrate the oil behavior. The impact of the oil droplet sizes are demonstrated. Although cases are not specific to a particular spill, through the use of a state-of-the-art model, we show the key parameters that affect the behavior of oil. In this paper we show oil and gas behavior that has not been clearly explained in previous papers and address newly found concerns brought on by the recent awareness. This paper also shows how the oil behavior changes when additives like dispersants are applied. Results of the simulations reveal that the “underwater plumes” with low concentrations of oil can be formed and stay submerged for long periods of time when very small (less than 0.5 mm in diameter) oil droplets are present.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadditives 3adroplets 3amodels 3aoils 3aGulf of Mexico1 aWimalaratne, Malinda R.1 aDissanayake, Anusha L.1 aDeGraff, Jeffrey A., Jr.cJr.0 tJournal of hydro-environment research.g2012 Dec., v. 6, no. 4 p.275-285dElsevier B.V.x1570-64437nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jher.2012.05.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02452naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001300147245011000160520115500270592002801425650001301453650001501466650003901481650001201520650001701532650001901549650001301568650001501581650002001596650001401616650001801630653001501648653002001663653002101683653002101704700001801725700001501743700001801758700001301776700001701789773010901806856008201915852000901997655001202006IND60654459220221122232624.0190807e201909  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065445922DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcs.2019.1028102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Xu10aInvestigation of water migration and its impacts on eating qualities of black rice during cooking process  aThe migration of water molecules and its impacts on eating qualities of cooking black rice was investigated using a LF-NMR, CLSM, Rheometer and TPA. LF-NMR images showed that embryo of rice grain possessed high water content and water molecules gradually migrated from outer to interior of the grain during cooking process. During gelatinization, the changes of starch granules could be divided into three periods: granule swelling, short chains leaching out and granule adhesion. As a consequence of water migration, the amylose and amylopectin chains in the leachate created an opportunity for bonding and molecular interaction with water molecules, causing a low hardness, chewiness and a high adhesiveness, stickiness. The apparent viscosity of the cooking solution increased markedly with the extension of cooking time, which may attribute to starch components gradually leaching out from cooking black rice. These several techniques paved the way for a much deeper understanding the role of water molecules in cooking process and they also offered new insights for understanding changes of eating quality of black rice during cooking treatment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadhesion 3ablack rice 3aconfocal laser scanning microscopy 3acooking 3afood quality 3agelatinization 3aleaching 3arheometers 3astarch granules 3aviscosity 3awater content 0aBlack rice 0aWater migration 0aEndosperm starch 0aEating qualities1 aZhang, Xiuxiu1 aWang, Biyu1 aChen, Peirong1 aXu, Yang1 aDu, Xianfeng0 tJournal of cereal science.g2019 Sept., v. 89 p.102810-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46803x0733-52107nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcs.2019.1028103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02384naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245012300169300001600292520117700308592002801485650001501513650002101528650002001549650001701569650002601586650002601612650001401638653003001652653002701682653002101709653002501730700001701755700002001772700002001792773009201812856008501904852000901989655001201998IND60603235620221118180228.0180713e20150301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060323562DNAL7 a10.1016/j.talanta.2014.11.0312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLei, Kin Fong10aPaper-based microfluidic sensing device for label-free immunoassay demonstrated by biotin–avidin binding interaction  ap. 264-270.  aEfficient diagnosis is very important for the prevention and treatment of diseases. Rapid disease screening in ambulatory environment is one of the most pressing needs for disease control. Despite there are many methods to detect the results of immunoassays, quantitative measurement for rapid disease screening is still a great challenge for point-of-care applications. In this study, a fabrication method for depositing carbon nanotube bundles has been successfully developed for realization of functional paper-based microfluidic sensing device. Quantitative detection of label-free immunoassay, i.e., biotin–avidin binding interaction, was demonstrated by direct measurement of the current change of the biosensor after single application of the target analyte. Sensitivity of 0.33μA/ngmL⁻¹ and minimal detectable analyte concentration of 25ng/mL were achieved. The time necessary for the detection was 500s which is a large reduction compared with the conventional immunoassay. Such paper-based biosensor has the benefits of portability, fast response, simple operation, and low cost and has the potential for the development of rapid disease screening devices.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiosensors 3acarbon nanotubes 3adisease control 3aimmunoassays 3apoint-of-care systems 3aquantitative analysis 3ascreening 0aPaper-based microfluidics 0aLabel-free immunoassay 0aCarbon nanotubes 0aPortable diagnostics1 aYang, Shiyi,1 aTsai, Shiao-Wen1 aHsu, Hsiao-Ting0 tTalanta.g2015 Mar. 01, v. 134 p.264-270dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11742x0039-91407nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.talanta.2014.11.0313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02311naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001800155245009300173300001600266520112900282592002801411650000901439650001701448650001601465650001301481650001301494650001801507650001101525650001301536650001901549651001801568653002001586653001901606653001501625653001301640653002301653700001701676700002201693773007601715856008901791852000901880655001201889IND60545425020221117235652.0160902e201505  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054542502DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2015.01.0542doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHe, Y. Thomas10aInvestigation of MCHM transport mechanisms and fate: Implications for coal beneficiation  ap. 158-163.  a4-Methyl cyclohexane methanol (MCHM) is a flotation reagent often used in fine coal beneficiation and notably involved in the January 9, 2014 Elk River chemical spill in Charleston, WV. This study investigates the mechanisms controlling the transport and fate of MCHM in coal beneficiation plants and surrounding environments. Processes such as volatilization, sorption, and leaching were evaluated through laboratory batch and column experiments. The results indicate volatilization and sorption are important mechanisms which influence the removal of MCHM from water, with sorption being the most significant removal mechanism over short time scales (<1h). Additionally, leaching experiments show both coal and tailings have high affinity for MCHM, and this reagent does not desorb readily. Overall, the results from these experiments indicate that MCHM is either volatilized or sorbed during coal beneficiation, and it is not likely to transport out of coal beneficiation plant. Thus, use of MCHM in coal beneficiation plant is not likely to pose threat to either surface or groundwater under normal operating conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3acoal 3acyclohexanes 3agroundwater 3aleaching 3amethanol 3amine tailings 3arivers 3asorption 3avolatilization 3aWest Virginia 0aMCHM solubility 0aVolatilization 0aAdsorption 0aLeaching 0aEnvironmental fate1 aNoble, Aaron1 aZiemkiewicz, Paul0 tChemosphere.g2015 May, v. 127 p.158-163dElsevier Ltdx0045-65357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2015.01.0543Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02097naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245006500165300001600230520101000246592002801256650001801284650002201302650001701324650001401341650002001355650001401375650001201389650002001401650002701421650000901448650002301457700002201480700002001502773011101522856008101633852000901714655001201723IND60439856120221123020507.0151024e201509  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6043985612DNAL7 a10.1007/s10924-014-0668-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJoseph, Seena10aStudies on Melt Processable Biocomposites of Polylactic Acid  ap. 321-333.  aMelt processable microcrystalline cellulose (MCC)/poly(lactic acid) (PLA) composites were successfully prepared by twin-screw extrusion. Several characterization techniques were used to investigate the effect of MCC on rheological behavior, morphology, crystallization and melting behavior of the PLA and structure–property correlation of the MCC/PLA composites has been established. Rheological measurements showed that the addition of MCC has a dramatic influence on the low frequency relaxations of PLA chains and above 5 % of MCC, it forms percolated network structure. Differential scanning calorimeter analysis showed that MCC acted as nucleating agent enhancing crystallization below the percolation concentration. Properties of MCC/PLA composites have been compared with that of talc and CaCO₃ filled composites. Talc is found to be more effective in crystallizing PLA than MCC and CaCO₃. MCC/PLA composites are found be melt processable like that of talc and CaCO₃ filled PLA composites.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiocomposites 3acalcium carbonate 3acalorimeters 3acellulose 3acrystallization 3aextrusion 3amelting 3apolylactic acid 3arheological properties 3atalc 3athermal properties1 aDeenadayalan, E.,1 aMahanwar, P.

The changes of disinfection byproducts (DBPs) precursors of trihalomethanes (THMs), haloacetic acids (HAAs) and halogenated acetaldehydes (HALs) in the RWDS in Taihu Basin were investigated by formation potentials. Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FT-ICR MS) method and 454-pyrosequencing were employed to study the variation of molecular characteristics of low molecular weight-dissolved organic matter (LMW-DOM) and microbial communities of pipeline biofilms respectively, which played crucial roles in the variation of DBPs precursors. The results showed that both DBPs precursors and the molecular characteristics of LMW-DOM in the RWDS had changed. Moreover, the LMW-DOM could be an indicator due to the good positive correlation with precursors of HAAs and HALs. Specifically, the LMW-DOM showed continuous accumulation in the RWDS. The LMW-DOM tended to possess higher m/z and more CH₂ or long alkyl chains while pre-chlorination controlled this trend. The LMW-DOM in the pre-chlorinated pipe section also possessed higher saturation. Additionally, lignins served as an important part of DBPs precursors and dominated the LMW-DOM. The microbial diversity decreased in the RWDS, and the abundance and diversity of the microbial community in the pre-chlorinated section were significantly lower than those in the no-chlorinated section. Finally, most DBPs precursors had positive correlation with dominant phylum and genus in RWDS. This study reveals variation of DBPs precursors, LMW-DOM and microbial pipeline biofilms as well, and provide important data for further research on raw water safety and stability in RWDSs.  aPublisher supplied data 3abasins 3abiofilm 3adisinfection 3adissolved organic matter 3ahigh-throughput nucleotide sequencing 3alignin 3amass spectrometry 3amicrobial communities 3awater distribution 3awater supply 0aDisinfection byproducts precursors 0aRWDS 0aLMW-DOM 0aMicrobial pipeline biofilms1 aXu, Hang1 aShen, Zhen1 aLiu, Chenwei1 aDing, Mingmei1 aLin, Tao1 aTao, Hui1 aChen, Wei0 tChemosphere.g2021 Nov., v. 283 p.131180-dElsevier LtdwJournal:1969x0045-65357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2021.1311803Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02566naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002400147245010800171500002200279520116600301592002801467650001101495650002401506650001101530650001001541650002201551650001601573650001701589650001201606650001101618650000901629650001501638650002701653650001301680650000801693650001401701650001601715653002101731653001601752653001201768653001901780700002801799700002001827700002801847773010601875856008201981852000902063655001202072IND60654459820221121062421.0190726e20190722xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065445982DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcs.2019.1028122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTorbica, Aleksandra10aQuality prediction of bread made from composite flours using different parameters of empirical rheology  aPre-press version  aThe aim of this study was to explore the possibility of predicting quality of bread from composite flours on the basis of empirical rheological parameters. Composite flours were contained wheat flour partially substituted (10 and 30%) by flours of durum wheat, rye, triticale, barley, oat, millet and sorghum. Dough rheological properties of all composite flours were determined using Farinograph, Mixolab and Micro-doughLAB. Breadmaking was conducted at two mixing speeds and two fermentation times.Farinograph stability and dough development time can be used to predict bread quality at lower level of substitution (10%). C2 point by Mixolab can be used to predict specific volume of bread in all conditions. PCA performed on Mixolab parameters showed grouping of samples by culture used for substitution of wheat flours. Based on Mixolab results it can be concluded that this device is more sensitive to the separation of the samples by culture, compared to the Farinograph. Most of the Micro-doughLAB parameters of high mixing speed could predict quality of bread prepared using high speed mixer at both fermentation regimes and both levels of substitution.  aPublisher supplied data 3abarley 3abreadmaking quality 3abreads 3adough 3adough development 3adurum wheat 3afermentation 3amillets 3amixing 3aoats 3aprediction 3arheological properties 3arheology 3arye 3atriticale 3awheat flour 0aComposite flours 0aFarinograph 0aMixolab 0aMicro-doughLAB1 aBlažek, Karolina Mocko1 aBelović, Miona1 aHajnal, Elizabet Janić0 tJournal of cereal science.g2019 July 22,  p.102812-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46803x0733-52107nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcs.2019.1028123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02618naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001400147245011200161300001600273520139600289592002801685650002101713650001801734650002001752650003801772650002101810650002601831650001301857650003301870650001601903650001601919700001901935700001301954700001801967700001301985700002101998773011102019856008102130852000902211655001202220IND60439856220221123020435.0151024e201509  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6043985622DNAL7 a10.1007/s10924-014-0686-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBai, Yang10aMiscibility, Thermal and Mechanical Properties of Poly(para-dioxanone)/Poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) Blends  ap. 367-373.  aA series of biodegradable polymers was prepared by solution co-precipitation of poly(para-dioxanone) (PPDO) and poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) in various blend ratios. Samples were compression-molded into bars using a platen vulcanizing press. The miscibility, thermal and mechanical properties of the materials were investigated using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), polarized optical microscopy, and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Dynamic contact angle was used to characterize the water wettability of PLGA/PPDO blends. The mechanical properties of blends and pure polymers were measured by tensile tests. The position of the glass transition temperatures (T g) was dependent upon composition. When 10 % PLGA was added into PPDO, the DSC curve revealed only one T g (−7.35 °C) which was located between the T g values of PPDO and PLGA. When 20 % PLGA was added into the blend, two independent T g values for PPDO/PLGA blends were observed, and such characteristics improved further upon addition of 30 % PLGA. SEM images of fractured surfaces displayed evidence of the morphology of PPDO/PLGA blends that were consistent with the DSC results. Hence, a relationship was found between homogeneity and the contents of PLGA in the blend. The compatibility of the blends increased with addition of small amounts of PLGA, followed by a leveling-off at higher content.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiodegradability 3acontact angle 3acoprecipitation 3adifferential scanning calorimetry 3aglass transition 3amechanical properties 3apolymers 3ascanning electron microscopy 3atemperature 3awettability1 aWang, Pingquan1 aBai, Wei1 aZhang, Lifang1 aLi, Qing1 aXiong, Chengdong0 tJournal of polymers and the environment.g2015 Sept., v. 23, no. 3 p.367-373dSpringer USx1566-25437nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10924-014-0686-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02844naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002500150245014500175300001600320520152500336592002801861650002201889650002201911650001501933650001401948650001701962650001301979650001601992650001102008650001102019653002402030653000902054653002202063653001902085653000802104700002602112700001902138700006302157773010802220856008502328852000902413655001202422IND60571044620221119051425.0180830e201711  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057104462DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fuproc.2017.06.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSattayanon, Chanchai10aReaction and free-energy pathways of hydrogen activation on partially promoted metal edge of CoMoS and NiMoS: A DFT and thermodynamics study  ap. 217-227.  aUnderstanding of molecular hydrogen (H2) activation mechanism on MoS2-based catalysts is crucial for enhancement of catalytic hydrotreating processes. In this work, H2 activation reaction pathways including adsorption, dissociation, and diffusion phases on metal edge of partially Co-promoted MoS2 (CoMoS) and partially Ni-promoted MoS2 (NiMoS) catalysts under hydrotreating conditions have been investigated using density functional theory and thermodynamic calculations. Here, investigation of H2 adsorption on CoMoS and NiMoS catalysts shows that H2 molecule prefers to adsorb on the promoter site rather than the sulfur site, while the H2 molecule adsorbs firmly on CoMoS but substantially weaker on NiMoS. H2 dissociation is the rate-determining step for both CoMoS and NiMoS catalysts and the activation energy (Ea) of rate-determining step for both catalysts is identical (Ea=0.79eV). However, thermodynamic result indicates that CoMoS is more reactive toward H2 activation than NiMoS (free energy of activation (ΔG‡) at 575K=0.65 and 1.14eV for CoMoS and NiMoS, respectively). In terms of diffusion, hydrogen atom migrates relatively easy (Ea<0.55eV) on both CoMoS and NiMoS surfaces. Partial charge analysis reveals that both heterolytic and homolytic H2 dissociation characteristics are observed on CoMoS and NiMoS depending on the reaction site. In addition, dissociated hydrogen atoms are more stable in terms of thiol group (SH) on CoMoS while metal-hydrogen pairs (MoH and NiH) are more stable on NiMoS.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGibbs free energy 3aactivation energy 3aadsorption 3acatalysts 3adissociation 3ahydrogen 3amethodology 3asulfur 3athiols 0aHydrogen activation 0aMoS2 0aReaction pathways 0aThermodynamics 0aDFT1 aNamuangruk, Supawadee1 aKungwan, Nawee1 aKunaseth, Manaschai1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1327-25020 tFuel processing technology.g2017 Nov., v. 166 p.217-227dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12445x0378-38207nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fuproc.2017.06.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01467naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245006600169300001400235500001100249520044100260592002800701650002400729650002300753650002500776650001000801650001800811650001000829651001500839651001300854700002600867700002000893773011300913856008201026852000901108655001201117IND60588976920221120122311.0200423e201801  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058897692DNAL7 a10.1007/s11418-017-1146-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSugimoto, Sachiko10aBiological activity of Entada phaseoloides and Entada rheedei  ap. 12-19.  aReview  aThe aim of our study is to find functional compounds from natural resources.

The effects of nonoxidized tannic acid (nTA), oxidized tannic acid (OTA), and CNC on the physical, antioxidant, and antimicrobial properties of gelatin films were investigated. Rheological and ultraviolet (UV)–visible measurements showed that gelatin films with nTA and CNC presented a lower chemical cross-linking and more noncovalent intermolecular interactions in comparison with those containing OTA. When compared to the film containing only nTA, the one with nTA and CNC presented substantial increases in the antioxidant capacity (52%), UV barrier (76%), tensile strength (79%), and water vapor barrier (67%) properties of gelatin. This evidence suggested that noncovalent interactions from nTA molecules and CNC play an important role in the modification of gelatin. The gelatin films designed with nTA and CNC also exhibited antimicrobial effects against Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli. Overall, the incorporation of CNC and nTA as active components to gelatin films is a suitable approach for producing sustainable, multifunctional materials for food packaging and other applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3aStaphylococcus aureus 3aantioxidant activity 3aantioxidants 3acellulose 3acrosslinking 3agelatin 3agreen chemistry 3ananocrystals 3atannins 3atensile strength 3awater vapor 0atannic acid 0acellulose nanocrystal 0afilm 0anatural antioxidant properties 0aantimicrobial activity1 aPham, Cynthia1 aBilatto, Stanley1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9566-62751 aAzeredo, Henriette M.C.1 aCranston, Emily D.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4210-97871 aMoreira, Francys Kley1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6368-31771 aMattoso, Luiz Henrique C.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7586-10141 aBras, Julien1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2023-54350 tACS sustainable chemistry & engineering.g2021 June 16, v. 9, no. 25 p.8539-8549dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23317x2168-04857nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acssuschemeng.1c017743Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01765naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002100145245014100166300001800307520053800325592002800863650002300891650002100914650001800935650000900953650002200962650002200984650001401006650000701020650002001027650001901047700002001066700002201086700006101108773013401169856007901303852000901382655001201391IND60605125520221120092351.0180720e20171128xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060512552DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.joc.7b025472doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGerken, James B.10aStructural Effects on the pH-Dependent Redox Properties of Organic Nitroxyls: Pourbaix Diagrams for TEMPO, ABNO, and Three TEMPO Analogs  ap. 7323-7330.  aElectrochemical studies of the reduction and oxidation reactions of five different organic nitroxyls have been performed across a wide pH range (0–13).

The observed self-assembly is described by an isodesmic model, as shown by temperature-dependent UV–vis investigations. Linear dichroism (LD) studies, combined with computational modeling using time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT), suggests that TANI-PTAB molecules are ordered in an antiparallel arrangement within nanowires, with the long axis of TANI-PTAB arranged perpendicular to the nanowire long axis. Addition of either S- or R- camphorsulfonic acid (CSA) to TANI-PTAB converted TANI to the emeraldine salt (ES), which retained the ability to form nanowires. Acid doping of TANI-PTAB had a profound effect on the nanowire morphology, as the CSA counterions’ chirality translated into helical twisting of the nanowires, as observed by circular dichroism (CD). Finally, the electrical conductivity of CSA-doped helical nanowire thin films processed from aqueous solution was 2.7 mS cm–¹. The conductivity, control over self-assembled 1D structure and water-solubility demonstrate these materials’ promise as processable and addressable functional materials for molecular electronics, redox-controlled materials and sensing.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aaniline 3aaqueous solutions 3acircular dichroism spectroscopy 3aelectrical conductivity 3aelectronics 3amodels 3ananowires 3astereoisomerism 3awater solubility1 aWu, Guanglu1 aHaataja, Johannes S.1 aBrömmel, Felicitas1 aFey, Natalie1 aSeddon, Annela M.1 aHarniman, Robert

A broad variety of commercial diets are available containing either hydrolysed protein or novel ingredients which claim to be suitable for elimination diets. Contamination may be one factor accounting for the failure of commercial elimination diet trials. HYPOTHESIS/OBJECTIVES: To test commercial diets labelled as suitable for elimination diets for dogs, for DNA of animal origin other than that declared on the label. METHODS: Twelve commercial dry and tinned dog food products were investigated for DNA of animal origin (chicken, turkey, beef, mutton and pork) using PCR testing. RESULTS: In nine of 10 over‐the‐counter diets, DNA of one or more animal species other than declared on the label was identified. The DNA most frequently detected was derived from beef (n = 8) and pork (n = 6). Two hydrolysed diets only contained DNA of the declared animal source. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: Over‐the‐counter “single protein diets” or canned meat products cannot be recommended for the diagnosis of dogs with AFR because contamination may cause the elimination diet to fail.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3abeef 3acanned meat 3achickens 3adogs 3aelimination diets 3ahydrolysis 3aingredients 3amutton 3apet foods 3apolymerase chain reaction 3apork 3aprotein hydrolysates 3aveterinary medicine1 aWidmann, Karoline1 aHandl, Stefanie0 tVeterinary dermatology.g2017 Aug., v. 28, no. 4 p.373-e86dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl46684x0959-44937nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/vde.124313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02818naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100006200153245011900215300001600334520134800350592002801698650001301726650002501739650001101764650001901775650001201794650001501806650002001821650001801841650002101859650001701880650002801897653001701925653003201942653003501974653002802009653002502037653003302062700003302095700002702128773012002155856008802275852000902363655001202372IND60625570820221118062117.0190131e201903  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062557082DNAL7 a10.1016/j.resconrec.2018.12.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAdjei-Bamfo, Peter1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5009-257814aThe role of e-government in sustainable public procurement in developing countries: A systematic literature review  ap. 189-203.  aDespite their relatively lower national income, studies suggest that developing countries have consistently advanced their e-government structures. However, there is little knowledge on how governments’ deployment of electronic and internet technologies may be leveraged to stimulate sustainable supply chain management, particularly Sustainable Public Procurement (SPP) practices. From a Systematic Literature Review (SLR), this paper affirms such allusions by scholars and reports that government deployment of electronic and internet tools indeed promotes SPP towards the bigger agenda of sustainable development (SDG 12.7). In this paper, 68 articles of heterogeneous research methods published in peer-review journals since 2001–2017 are systematically reviewed. This paper concludes that efforts in building a robust ICT infrastructure, online portals, and human capacity to use ICT offer developing countries inter alia an informative platform for sharing and communicating SPP requirements. E-government also facilitates a wider sample for market readiness assessment and an integrated e-procurement system towards effective SPP monitoring and evaluation. This study has significant implications for promoting sustainability in the downstream supply chain practices in public sector organizations in the developing country context.  aPublisher supplied data 3aInternet 3adeveloping countries 3ahumans 3ainfrastructure 3amarkets 3amonitoring 3anational income 3apublic sector 3aresearch methods 3asupply chain 3asustainable development 0ae-Government 0aPublic sector e-procurement 0aSustainable public procurement 0aSustainable development 0aDeveloping countries 0aSystematic literature review1 aMaloreh-Nyamekye, Theophilus1 aAhenkan, A.q(Albert),0 tResources, conservation, and recycling.g2019 Mar., v. 142 p.189-203dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11928x0921-34497nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.resconrec.2018.12.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01749naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094024002200122024001900144040001800163100002300181245013400204300002000338506007600358520040100434592002800835506003700863650001400900650002700914650002300941650001500964650001500979650001200994700002401006700002801030700002901058700002501087700001901112773013601131856007501267852000901342655001201351IND60659127220221207105528.0190827e20111129xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065912722DNAL7 a10.1039/c1cc15451f2doi7 aPMC32365972pmcid7 a220449292pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGanguly, Tanushree14aThe hydrazide/hydrazone click reaction as a biomolecule labeling strategy for M(CO)₃ (M = Re, ⁹⁹ᵐTc) radiopharmaceuticals  ap. 12846-12848.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aFacile reactivity of hydrazides and aldehydes was explored as potential coupling partners for incorporation into M(CO)₃ (M = Re, ⁹⁹ᵐTc) based radiopharmaceuticals.

Thermally unstable acyl azide, prone to Curtius rearrangement, was found to be controllable under mechanochemical ball milling conditions. Investigation of the mechanochemical process window of acyl azide led us to define highly selective Cp*Ir(III)-catalyzed acyl azide activation to acyl nitrene species and direct C–H amidation protocol. In addition to the expected merits of mechanochemistry, the newly developed high-speed ball milling method allows for carbamoyl azide utilization, which showed a limited scope under thermal solution conditions, registering to a list of mechanochemically preferred reactions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aazides 3agreen chemistry 3amechanochemistry 0aBall milling 0aAcyl azides 0aCarbamoyl azide 0aC−H amidation 0aSolvent-free synthesis1 aHong, Eun Ji1 aHuynh, Thang Quoc1 aKim, Byeong-Su1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6419-30541 aKim, Jeung Gon1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1685-28330 tACS sustainable chemistry & engineering.g2021 June 22, v. 9, no. 26 p.8679-8685dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23317x2168-04857nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acssuschemeng.1c017863Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02548naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001600148245015000164300001600314520096500330592002801295650001501323650001901338650002001357650002901377650003101406650002201437650001601459650001901475650001501494650002101509650001401530650003501544650002601579653002901605653002801634653002501662653003801687700001901725700001201744700001501756700002001771700001601791700001801807700001401825773011101839856008301950852000902033655001202042IND60557324820221119054413.0180831e20170615xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055732482DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bios.2016.10.0262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXu, Huifeng10aEnhanced electrogenerated chemiluminescence behavior of C3N4 QDs@ C3N4 nanosheet and its signal-on aptasensing for platelet derived growth factor  ap. 695-701.  aA novel g-C3N4 nanosheets embedded with C3N4 QDs nanocomposites (QD@CNNS) was prepared by simple oxidation using hydrogen peroxide and UV light irradiation. This nanocomposite exhibits more stable and stronger electrochemiluminescent (ECL) behavior compared with CNNS. Coupling this nanocomposite with Fc-labeled aptamer, a signal-on aptasensor for platelet derived growth factor BB (PDGF-BB) is fabricated. Initially, the Fc-labeled aptamer binds onto QD@CNNS via π-π conjugation and electrostatic interaction, quenching ECL emission from QD@CNNS. The introduction of target efficiently recovers the ECL signal by the formation of PDGF-BB/aptamer complex. The ECL intensity is proportion to the concentration of PDGF-BB in the range of 0.02–80nM with a detection limit of 0.013nM. This work demonstrates a simple synthesis method to obtain QD@CNNS with excellent ECL behavior, and opens up the application of g-C3N4 nanocomposite in signal-on aptasensing.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiosensors 3acarbon nitride 3adetection limit 3aelectrochemiluminescence 3aelectrostatic interactions 3ahydrogen peroxide 3airradiation 3ananocomposites 3ananosheets 3aoligonucleotides 3aoxidation 3aplatelet-derived growth factor 3aultraviolet radiation 0aC3N4 QDs@ C3N4 nanosheet 0aElectrochemiluminescent 0aSignal-on aptasensor 0aPlatelet derived growth factor BB1 aLiang, Shijing1 aZhu, Xi1 aWu, Xiuqin1 aDong, Yongqiang1 aWu, Haishan1 aZhang, Wenxia1 aChi, Yuwu0 tBiosensors & bioelectronics.g2017 June 15, v. 92 p.695-701dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11631x0956-56637nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bios.2016.10.0263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03694naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002100140245007700161520247600238592002802714650001302742650001402755650002302769650002602792650001302818650002202831650001302853650000902866650001602875650000902891650002502900650001902925650001702944651001002961700002202971700002202993700002203015700002403037773012803061856007403189852000903263655001203272IND60652607920221122151954.0190713e20180913xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065260792DNAL7 a10.3390/su100932742doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSaganeiti, Lucia10aAssessing Urban Fragmentation at Regional Scale Using Sprinkling Indexes  aArtificial land use trends could represent an effective indicator of the settlement process quality and could also provide information about the efficacy of protection and exploitation policies in natural and rural areas. This work discusses an analytic procedure for the time series investigation of urban settlement development at the regional scale to verify the nexus between urban growth and demographic trends connected with the phenomenon of land take. In Italy, since 1950, the land take phenomenon has been a consequence of several factors: urbanization, realization of transport infrastructures including ports, airports, and highways, and the enhancement of industrial and productive systems. We analyzed all these territorial transformations that create waterproof soil, and more generally, a transition from natural and semi-natural uses toward artificial land use. After World War II, the demographic growth and the consequent housing demand generated a strong urbanization process in the main poles of economic development areas in Italy. Since the early 2000s, the situation has completely changed and the land take phenomenon is no longer mainly based on real need for new urban expansion areas based on effective urban planning tools, but is strongly related to a scattered demand for new housing in a weak territorial spatial planning system not able to drive effective urban development that minimizes speculative real estate initiatives. This uncontrolled occupation of soil generated, in Italy, a landscape fragmentation called the urban sprinkling phenomenon, different from urban sprawl, which is a wider phenomenon characterized by disordered urban growth. The present document aims to assess how uncontrolled expansion in areas characterized by low settlement density can generate fragmentation. To define if the territory is affected by the urban sprinkling phenomenon, two 50-year time series concerning urban expansion of buildings and demographic trends are analyzed calculating population and building density indices and their variation over the years. The sprinkling index is used to analyze the variation in the fragmentation degree at two different scales (regional and municipal). Finally, we discuss the context where this phenomenon has developed, analyzing the buildings located in hydrogeological risk zones and protected areas, and the correlation between demographic changes and the degree of territorial fragmentation variation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aairports 3abuildings 3aconservation areas 3ahabitat fragmentation 3ahighways 3aissues and policy 3aland use 3arisk 3arural areas 3asoil 3atime series analysis 3aurban planning 3aurbanization 3aItaly1 aFavale, Antonella1 aPilogallo, Angela1 aScorza, Francesco1 aMurgante, Beniamino0 tSustainability.g2018 Sept. 13, v. 10, no. 9dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2270x2071-10507nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su100932743Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02892naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245013300166300001600299520162800315592002801943650002801971650001701999650001902016650001702035650001402052650002202066650001202088650003102100650001202131650001702143650002202160650001302182700001802195700001602213700001902229700001602248773012702264856008202391852000902473655001202482IND60089573620221123031408.0141102e20120511xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008957362DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbrc.2012.04.0412doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHan, Jeong-Ho14aThe functional analysis of the CHMP2B missense mutation associated with neurodegenerative diseases in the endo-lysosomal pathway  ap. 544-549.  aEndosomal sorting complexes required for transport (ESCRTs) regulate a key sorting step of protein trafficking between endosomal compartments in lysosomal degradation. Interestingly, mutations in charged multivesicular body protein 2B (CHMP2B), which is a core subunit of ESCRT-III, have been identified in some neurodegenerative diseases. However, the cellular pathogenesis resulting from CHMP2B missense mutations is unclear. Furthermore, little is known about their functional analysis in post-mitotic neurons. In order to examine their cellular pathogenesis, we analyzed their effects in the endo-lysosomal pathway in post-mitotic neurons. Interestingly, of the missense mutant proteins, CHMP2Bᵀ¹⁰⁴ᴺ mostly accumulated in the Rab5- and Rab7-positive endosomes and caused delayed degradation of EGFR as compared to CHMP2Bᵂᵀ. Furthermore, CHMP2Bᵀ¹⁰⁴ᴺ showed less association with Vps4 ATPase and was avidly associated with Snf7-2, a core component of ESCRT-III, suggesting that it may cause defects in the process of dissociation from ESCRT. Of the missense variants, CHMP2Bᵀ¹⁰⁴ᴺ caused prominent accumulation of autophagosomes. However, neuronal cell survival was not dramatically affected by expression of CHMP2Bᵀ¹⁰⁴ᴺ. These findings suggested that, from among the various missense mutants, CHMP2Bᵀ¹⁰⁴ᴺ was associated with relatively mild cellular pathogenesis in post-mitotic neurons. This study provided a better understanding of the cellular pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases associated with various missense mutations of CHMP2B as well as endocytic defects.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadenosinetriphosphatase 3abody protein 3acell viability 3adissociation 3aendosomes 3amissense mutation 3amutants 3aneurodegenerative diseases 3aneurons 3apathogenesis 3aprotein transport 3aproteins1 aRyu, Hyun-Hee1 aJun, Mi-Hee1 aJang, Deok-Jin1 aLee, Jin-A.0 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2012 May 11, v. 421, no. 3 p.544-549dElsevier Inc.x0006-291X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2012.04.0413Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02241naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001700144245015300161300002000314520081500334592002801149650001901177650001901196650002501215653001701240653003201257653002901289653002801318653002801346653003301374700001601407700001401423700001601437700001501453700002001468700005801488700005501546773014201601856007901743852000901822655001201831IND60758711220221118065906.0211202e20211116xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075871122DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.1c162992doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhu, Yongbin10aEnhanced Thermoelectric Performance by Strong Phonon Scattering at the Heterogeneous Interfaces of the Mg₂Sn/Mg₃Sb₂ High-Content Nanocomposite  ap. 56164-56170.  aNano approaches are practical strategies to boost the thermoelectric figure of merit due to the strong phonon scattering from the grain boundaries and nanoinclusions. Here, we have reported a strong phonon scattering at the heterogeneous interfaces of Mg₂Sn/Mg₃Sb₂ high-content nanocomposites (HCnCs). As a result, a significantly reduced lattice thermal conductivity of 1.09 W m–¹ K–¹ was observed in the equimolar Mg₂Sn/Mg₃Sb₂ HCnC, 80% lower than pure Mg₂Sn and 25% lower than pure Mg₃Sb₂. As a result, a high ZT ∼ 1.13 at 773 K was achieved in the Mg₂Sn/Mg₃Sb₂ HCnC. Furthermore, various defects, including solid solutions, nanoinclusions, and misfit dislocations, were observed in both the Mg₃Sb₂ phase and the Mg₂Sn phase through the microstructure characterization.  aPublisher supplied data 3amicrostructure 3ananocomposites 3athermal conductivity 0aMg2Sn/Mg3Sb2 0ahigh-content nanocomposites 0aheterogeneous interfaces 0aeffective medium theory 0ahigh Kapitza resistance 0alattice thermal conductivity1 aHan, Zhijia1 aHan, Bing1 aJiang, Feng1 aWu, Xinzhi1 aHan, Cheng-Gong1 aDeng, Yonghong1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0898-45721 aLiu, Weishu1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8643-822X0 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2021 Nov. 16, v. 13, no. 47 p.56164-56170dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.1c162993Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02605naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245012300169300001400292520149300306592002801799650002901827650000801856650002701864650001601891650002301907650001401930650001101944650001601955650001301971650002001984650001202004700002202016700001902038773008402057856008102141852000902222655001202231IND60121523620221118234540.0150414e201502  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012152362DNAL7 a10.1007/s11262-014-1142-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGell, Gyöngyvér10aRecombination analysis of Maize dwarf mosaic virus (MDMV) in the Sugarcane mosaic virus (SCMV) subgroup of potyviruses  ap. 79-86.  aRecombination among RNA viruses is a natural phenomenon that appears to have played a significant role in the species development and the evolution of many strains. It also has particular significance for the risk assessment of plants which have been genetically modified for disease resistance by incorporating viral sequences into their genomes. However, the exact recombination events taking place in viral genomes are not investigated in detail for many virus groups. In this analysis, different single-stranded positive-sense RNA potyviruses were compared using various in silico recombination detection methods and new recombination events in the Sugarcane mosaic virus (SCMV) subgroup were detected. For an extended in silico recombination analysis, two of the analyzed Maize dwarf mosaic virus full-length genomes were sequenced additionally during this work. These results strengthen the evidence that recombination is a major driving force in virus evolution, and the emergence of new virus variants in the SCMV subgroup, paired with mutations, could generate viruses with altered biological properties. The intra- and interspecific homolog recombinations seem to be a general trait in this virus group, causing little or no changes to the amino acid of the progenies. However, we found a few breakpoints between the members of SCMV subgroup and the weed-infecting distant relatives, but only a few methods of the RDP3 package predicted these events with low significance level.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMaize dwarf mosaic virus 3aRNA 3aSugarcane mosaic virus 3aamino acids 3adisease resistance 3aevolution 3agenome 3amethodology 3amutation 3arisk assessment 3aviruses1 aSebestyén, Endre1 aBalázs, Ervin0 tVirus genes.g2015 Feb., v. 50, no. 1 p.79-86dSpringer-Verlagx0920-85697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11262-014-1142-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02988naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002500145245012700170300001800297520148700315592002801802650002201830650001201852650002501864650002301889650001301912650002201925650004401947650002201991650001402013650000702027650001502034650001602049650001402065650002202079650001402101650001302115700002802128700006202156700003102218700005902249773013402308856007902442852000902521655001202530IND60605125920221120103026.0180720e20180126xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060512592DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.joc.7b029712doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTeixeira, Mariana L.10aInvestigation of Chemical Stability of Dihalogenated Organotelluranes in Organic–Aqueous Media: The Protagonism of Water  ap. 7341-7346.  aThe biological activity of tellurium compounds is closely related to the tellurium oxidation state or some of their structural features. Hypervalent dihalogenated organotelluranes 1-[butyl(dichloro)-λ⁴-tellanyl]-2-(methoxymethyl)benzene (1a) and 1-[butyl(dibromide)-λ⁴-tellanyl]-2-(methoxymethyl)benzene (1b) have been described as inhibitors of proteases (cysteine and threonine) and tyrosine phosphatases. However, poor attention has been given to their physicochemical properties. Here, a detailed investigation of the stability in water of these organotelluranes is reported using ¹²⁵Te NMR analysis. Dihalogenated organotelluranes 1a and 1b were both stable in DMSO-d₆ (from 25 to 75 °C), demonstrating their thermal stability. However, the addition of a phosphate buffer solution (pH 2–8) to 1a or 1b resulted in an immediate conversion to a new Te species, assumed to be the corresponding telluroxide. Similar behavior was observed in pure water, demonstrating the low chemical stability of these dihalogenated species in the presence of water. These results allow concluding that previous biological activity reported for dihalogenated organotelluranes 1a and 1b could be attributed to the corresponding derivatives from the reaction with water. In the same way as for AS-101, we demonstrated that organotelluranes 1a and 1b are not stable in aqueous solution. It suggests a proactive role of these organotelluranes in previously reported biological activity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaqueous solutions 3abenzene 3abioactive properties 3achemical structure 3acysteine 3aenzyme inhibitors 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aorganic chemistry 3aoxidation 3apH 3aphosphates 3aproteinases 3atellurium 3athermal stability 3athreonine 3atyrosine1 aMenezes, Leociley R.

Previously, a genome‐wide significant risk locus on canine chromosome 27 for CAD was identified in German shepherd dogs (GSDs) and Plakophilin‐2 (PKP2) was defined as the top candidate gene. PKP2 constitutes a crucial component of desmosomes and also is important in signalling, metabolic and transcriptional activities. OBJECTIVES: The main objective was to evaluate the role of PKP2 in CAD by investigating PKP2 expression and desmosome structure in nonlesional skin from CAD‐affected (carrying the top GWAS SNP risk allele) and healthy GSDs. We also aimed at defining the cell types in the skin that express PKP2 and its intracellular location. ANIMALS/METHODS: Skin biopsies were collected from nine CAD‐affected and five control GSDs. The biopsies were frozen for immunofluorescence and fixed for electron microscopy immunolabelling and morphology. RESULTS: We observed the novel finding of PKP2 expression in dendritic cells and T cells in dog skin. Moreover, we detected that PKP2 was more evenly expressed within keratinocytes compared to its desmosomal binding‐partner plakoglobin. PKP2 protein was located in the nucleus and on keratin filaments attached to desmosomes. No difference in PKP2 abundance between CAD cases and controls was observed. CONCLUSION: Plakophilin‐2 protein in dog skin is expressed in both epithelial and immune cells; based on its subcellular location its functional role is implicated in both nuclear and structural processes.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aGerman Shepherd 3aT-lymphocytes 3aalleles 3aatopic dermatitis 3abiopsy 3adendritic cells 3adesmosomes 3adog diseases 3adogs 3aelectron microscopy 3aenvironmental factors 3aepithelium 3afluorescent antibody technique 3agamma catenin 3akeratin 3akeratinocytes 3aloci 3arisk 3atranscription (genetics) 3aveterinary medicine1 aTengvall, Katarina1 aBergvall, Kerstin1 aFarias, Fabiana H.G.1 aWang, Liya1 aHedhammar, Åke1 aLindblad‐Toh, Kerstin1 aAndersson, Göran,0 tVeterinary dermatology.g2017 Aug., v. 28, no. 4 p.377-e88dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl46684x0959-44937nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/vde.124413Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03935naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094024002200128024001900150040001800169100001800187245021600205300001200421506007600433520204500509592002802554506003702582650005302619650000902672650001402681650001802695650001202713650001602725650002102741650001302762650001602775650001802791650001802809650001602827650001602843650002102859650002002880650001402900650002002914650001802934650001202952650000902964650002602973650001102999650001103010650001403021651001803035700003203053700001903085700001703104700001903121773009203140856008003232852000903312655001203321IND50068791120221207055106.0140728e201312  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006879112DNAL7 a10.1186/1475-2891-12-1162doi7 aPMC37513112pmcid7 a239277182pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuth, Peter J10aMajor food sources of calories, added sugars, and saturated fat and their contribution to essential nutrient intakes in the U.S. diet: data from the national health and nutrition examination survey (2003–2006)  ap. 695.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe risk of chronic disease cannot be predicted simply by the content of a single nutrient in a food or food group in the diet. The contribution of food sources of calories, added sugars and saturated fat (SFA) to intakes of dietary fiber and micronutrients of public health importance is also relevant to understanding the overall dietary impact of these foods. Identify the top food sources of calories, added sugars and SFA in the U.S. diet and quantify their contribution to fiber and micronutrient intakes. Single 24-hour dietary recalls (Day 1) collected from participants ≥2 years (n = 16,822) of the What We Eat in America, National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (WWEIA/NHANES 2003-2006) were analyzed. All analyses included sample weights to account for the survey design. Calorie and nutrient intakes from foods included contributions from disaggregated food mixtures and tabulated by rank order. No one food category contributes more than 7.2% of calories to the overall U.S. diet, but half of the top 10 contribute 10% or more of total dietary fiber and micronutrients. Three of the top 10 sources of calories and SFA (beef, milk and cheese) contribute 46.3% of the calcium, 49.5% of the vitamin D, 42.3% of the vitamin B12 as well as other essential nutrients to the American diet. On the other hand, foods categorized as desserts, snacks, or beverages, contribute 13.6% of total calories, 83% of added sugar intake, and provide little or no nutritional value. Including food components of disaggregated recipes more accurately estimated the contribution of foods like beef, milk or cheese to overall nutrient intake compared to "as consumed" food categorizations. Some food sources of calories, added sugars and SFA make major contributions to American dietary fiber and micronutrient intakes. Dietary modifications targeting reductions in calories, added sugar, or SFA need to take these key micronutrient sources into account so as not to have the unintended consequence of lowering overall dietary quality.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aNational Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 3abeef 3abeverages 3ablended foods 3acalcium 3acheese milk 3achronic diseases 3adesserts 3adiet recall 3adietary fiber 3aenergy intake 3afood groups 3afood intake 3anutrient content 3anutrient intake 3anutrients 3anutritive value 3apublic health 3arecipes 3arisk 3asaturated fatty acids 3asnacks 3asugars 3avitamin D 3aUnited States1 aFulgoni, Victor L, IIIcIII1 aKeast, Debra R1 aPark, Keigan1 aAuestad, Nancy0 tNutrition journal.g2013 Dec., v. 12, no. 1 p.695-695dSpringer-Verlagx1475-28917nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1475-2891-12-1163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04015naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001600149245012200165300001600287520139800303592002801701596009801729596009801827596009801925596009802023596009802121596009802219596008102317596008702398596012102485650001002606650000902616650001602625650001002641650001102651650001402662650001702676650001402693650002202707650001502729651001002744653001002754653003202764653001402796653002202810700001802832700005602850700001902906700001502925700001302940700001702953700005302970700001903023700005303042700005703095773014403152856008403296852000903380655001203389IND60773371120221121111409.0220413e20220328xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077337112DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.estlett.2c001442doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZuo, Peijie10aStable Iron Isotopic Signature Reveals Multiple Sources of Magnetic Particulate Matter in the 2021 Beijing Sandstorms  ap. 299-305.  aAirborne magnetic particulate matters (MPs) in PM₂.₅ have been observed in human tissues, for example, the brain, heart, and pleural effusion, which have attracted widespread concern. Here, we show that the pollution level of MPs in PM₂.₅ (MPsPM₂.₅) increased remarkably during the 2021 Beijing sandstorm episodes. Moreover, the stable Fe isotopic compositions of MPsPM₂.₅ were investigated to identify and constrain the origins of the increased MPsPM₂.₅ pollution. We presented that the fine MPs pollution in PM₂.₅ during the Beijing sandstorm episodes in 2021 was emitted from a mixture of natural dust and anthropogenic emissions, rather than only a natural origin. More importantly, anthropogenic emissions played a more important role in MPsPM₂.₅ during most of the 2021 Beijing sandstorm episodes. Our results were essential for further evaluation of the health risks and climatic impacts of PM₂.₅, particularly for MPsPM₂.₅, during the sandstorm episodes. Furthermore, this study indicated that the sources and characteristics of PM₂.₅ during the 2021 Beijing sandstorms were more complex than previously expected (PM₂.₅ during the sandstorms was dominated by lithogenic material from arid regions), and hence, high-precision characterizations of their sources, chemical compositions, and toxicologies are needed for future pollution control.  aPublisher supplied data  a21825403cNational Natural Science Foundation of Chinadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100001809  a21904134cNational Natural Science Foundation of Chinadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100001809  a22188102cNational Natural Science Foundation of Chinadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100001809  a22193051cNational Natural Science Foundation of Chinadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100001809  a92143201cNational Natural Science Foundation of Chinadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100001809  a92143301cNational Natural Science Foundation of Chinadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100001809  aXDPB2003cChinese Academy of Sciencesdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100002367  aZDBS-LY-DQC030cChinese Academy of Sciencesdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100002367  aNAcYouth Innovation Promotion Association of the Chinese Academy of Sciencesdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100004739 3abrain 3adust 3adust storms 3aheart 3ahumans 3amagnetism 3aparticulates 3apollution 3apollution control 3atechnology 3aChina 0aPM2.5 0aMagnetic particulate matter 0aSandstorm 0aFe stable isotope1 aHuang, Yuming1 aLiu, Pengfei1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6237-37591 aZhang, Jingwei1 aYang, Hang1 aLiu, Lin1 aBi, Jianzhou1 aLu, Dawei1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8128-63671 aZhang, Qinghua1 aLiu, Qian1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8525-79611 aJiang, Guibin1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6335-39170 tEnvironmental science & technology letters.g2022 Mar. 28, v. 9, no. 4 p.299-305dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23341x2328-89307nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.estlett.2c001443Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02552naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001700144245011100161300002000272520135100292592002801643650002201671650002301693650003001716650002401746650001401770653001301784653000901797653000801806653000801814653003401822653002001856700001601876700005601892773014201948856007902090852000902169655001202178IND60758711420221118065840.0211202e20211118xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075871142DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.1c164492doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFeng, Shuang10aHexagonal MBene (Hf₂BO₂): A Promising Platform for the Electrocatalysis of Hydrogen Evolution Reaction  ap. 56131-56139.  aHexagonal MAB (h-MAB) phases and their two-dimensional (2-D) derivatives (h-MBenes) have emerged as promising materials since the discovery of Ti₂InB₂. Herein, we identified that a possible h-MBene, 2-D Hf₂BO₂, can be an excellent platform for the electrocatalysis of hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) by density functional theory calculations. We proposed two approaches of transition metal (TM) modifications by atom deposition and implanting to optimize the HER performance of 2-D Hf₂BO₂. It is revealed that a moderate charge reduction of surface O, which is induced by the introduction of TM atoms, is conductive to a higher catalytic performance. The synergistic effect between implanted TM atoms and Hf₂BO₂ matrix can efficiently activate the surface by broadening O-p orbitals and shifting up p-band center, especially for V, Cr, and Mo as dopants, which can reduce the Gibbs free energy (ΔGH*) from 0.939 to −0.04, 0.05 and −0.04 eV, respectively. Interestingly, this effect works within a local region and the activity can also be evaluated by bond length of Hf–O, in addition to ΔGH*. This work suggests that due to its excellent electrocatalysis properties, h-MBenes can open up a new area for 2-D materials and will stimulate researchers to explore the synthesis of h-MAB phases and the stripping of h-MBenes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGibbs free energy 3acatalytic activity 3adensity functional theory 3ahydrogen production 3asynergism 0ah-MBenes 0aHf2B 0aHER 0aDFT 0atransition metal modification 0acharge transfer1 aMiao, Nanxi1 aWang, Junjie1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6428-22330 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2021 Nov. 18, v. 13, no. 47 p.56131-56139dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.1c164493Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01712naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100005900150245009800209300001600307520065700323592002800980650002001008650001501028650002401043650002601067651001701093653001701110653001301127653001301140653002701153773011201180856008501292852000901377655001201386IND60714145220221122223445.0220124e20220220xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071414522DNAL7 a10.1016/j.quaint.2020.09.0382doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJimenez, Raevin1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3924-141310aFood production, environment, and mobility among Late Iron Age Nguni-speakers of South Africa  ap. 211-219.  aDuring the Late Iron Age, early Nguni-speaking farmers entered and moved across the region of the lower Thukela uplands through frequent, short-range episodes of population movement.

These findings raised the possibility that sIECs play an important role in inducing immune responses against luminal antigens, especially those of intestinal intraepithelial lymphocytes (IELs) and lamina propria lymphocytes (LPLs). We herein showed that antigenic stimulation with sIECs induced markedly greater secretion of interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) by CD4+ IELs, but not interleukin (IL)-4, IL-10 and IL-17 although the proliferative response was prominently lower than that with T cell-depleted splenic APCs. In contrast, no enhanced IFN-γ secretion by CD4+ LPLs and primed splenic CD4+ T cells was observed when stimulated with sIECs. Taken together, these results suggest that sIECs uniquely activate CD4+ IELs and induce remarkable IFN-γ secretion upon antigenic stimulation in vivo.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCD4-positive T-lymphocytes 3aantigen presentation 3aantigen-presenting cells 3aantigens 3aimmune response 3ainterferon-gamma 3ainterleukin-10 3ainterleukin-17 3aintestinal mucosa 3amajor histocompatibility complex 3asecretion 0aSmall intestinal epithelial cells 0aCD4+ intestinal intraepithelial lymphocytes 0aInterferon-γ 0aMajor histocompatibility complex class II molecule 0aAntigen specific activation1 aYamada, K.q(Kiyoshi),1 aIwamoto, Taku1 aMaeda, Nana1 aEmoto, Tetsuro1 aShimizu, Makoto1 aTotsuka, Mamoru0 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2013 June 14, v. 435 p.592-596dElsevier Inc.x0006-291X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2013.05.0243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03441naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245014900170300001400319520167600333592002802009650002502037650001702062650002402079650003102103650001702134650002102151650001502172650001602187650001102203650004402214650001302258650001402271650001802285650001902303653003202322653001902354653003502373653002702408653002202435653001502457653001002472653001102482653000902493653001002502653001102512653001102523653001002534653000902544653001102553700002002564700002302584700001902607773011902626856008502745852000902830655001202839IND60674373620221118000530.0200128e202002  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067437362DNAL7 a10.1016/j.pestbp.2019.10.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDahiya, Vandana10aIn vitro interaction of organophosphate metabolites with bovine serum albumin: A comparative 1H NMR, fluorescence and molecular docking analysis  ap. 39-50.  aSince the exposure of organophosphate pesticides are known to cause severe health consequences, it is important to understand the molecular interaction of these pesticides metabolites with vital biomolecules, especially with the proteins. Here, considering bovine serum albumin (BSA) as a model protein, we have examined its interaction with two selected organophosphate metabolites, 3,5,6-trichloro-2-pyridinol (TCPy) and paraoxon methyl (PM). TCPy and PM are resultant metabolites of two most widely used organophosphate pesticides chlorpyrifos and parathion respectively. ¹H NMR line broadening, selective spin-lattice relaxation rate measurements, saturation transfer difference (STD) NMR of both TCPy and PM were carried out in the presence and absence of BSA. The obtained values of the affinity index (A), binding constants (Kₐ) and thermodynamic parameters indicated strong organophosphates-BSA interaction. Further, fluorescence quenching data on TCPy-BSA and PM-BSA interactions strongly supported the NMR results, besides providing the stoichiometry of these complexes. Molecular docking analysis unraveled viable, strong hydrogen bonds and electrostatic interactions in TCPy-BSA and PM-BSA complexes. This study also revealed substantial time-dependent changes in the ¹H NMR intensity of PM in the presence of BSA, which suggests faster degradation of PM with increasing protein concentration during protein-metabolite interactions. The hydrolysis is attributed to the esterase-like action of BSA. The result provides key insights into the direct interaction of the organophosphate metabolites with a biologically important carrier protein, serum albumin.  aPublisher supplied data 3abovine serum albumin 3achlorpyrifos 3acomputer simulation 3aelectrostatic interactions 3afluorescence 3ahydrogen bonding 3ahydrolysis 3ametabolites 3amodels 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aparaoxon 3aparathion 3astoichiometry 3athermodynamics 0aNMR spin-lattice relaxation 0aAffinity index 0aSaturation transfer difference 0aFluorescence quenching 0aMolecular docking 0aHydrolysis 0a(NMR) 0a(TCPy) 0a(PM) 0a(BSA) 0a(R1SE) 0a(R1NS) 0a(STD) 0a(Kq) 0a(Ksv).1 aAnand, Bibin G.1 aKar, Karuṇākar,1 aPal, Samanwita0 tPesticide biochemistry and physiology.g2020 Feb., v. 163 p.39-50dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl1414x0048-35757nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.pestbp.2019.10.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02502naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001700140245011000157520150300267592002801770650002501798650002001823650001801843650002801861650001601889651001101905700001701916700002401933700002001957773012801977856007402105852000902179655001202188IND60652608120221122152007.0190713e20180913xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065260812DNAL7 a10.3390/su100932752doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLee, Zon-Yau10aIdentifying Comprehensive Key Criteria of Sustainable Development for Traditional Manufacturing in Taiwan  aThe traditional manufacturing industry has suffered from changing global demands and rapid technology upgrades. It is critical to incorporate innovation into contemporary manufacturing for sustainable development. A comprehensive interpretation of the determinants and directions of technical change is greatly needed. Therefore, this study aims to explore innovative applications that can enhance the value of manufacturing and examine the key factors associated with these innovations. In this paper, three traditional manufacturing industries are analyzed using the research methodologies analytic hierarchy processing (AHP) and Decision Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (DEMATEL), resulting in a set of six key criteria for innovative manufacturing. The causal relationships considering the six criteria in three industries are analyzed. The main contribution of this study is to establish a new framework for the sustainable development of traditional manufacturing industries. This could help to support conceptual innovation in these industries and establish a pragmatic approach to increase sustainable development. From the research results, the following suggestions can be made. The traditional manufacturing industries in Taiwan should focus on design and innovation. This can enhance the value-added and international competitiveness of industrial chains, enterprises, and products. Ultimately, it can lead to the sustainable development of Taiwan&rsquo;s traditional industries.  aPublisher supplied data 3abusiness enterprises 3adecision making 3amanufacturing 3asustainable development 3avalue added 3aTaiwan1 aChu, Mei-Tai1 aChen, Shiuann-Shuoh1 aTsai, Chih-Hung0 tSustainability.g2018 Sept. 13, v. 10, no. 9dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2270x2071-10507nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su100932753Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02752naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245005500168300001600223500001100239520134400250592002801594596008601622596010901708650000901817650002601826650000901852650001201861650001001873650001401883650001501897650001501912650001201927650001601939650001201955650003301967651001002000700002202010700001702032700001602049700002302065773011502088856008202203852000902285655001202294IND60588977820221120172302.0200423e201801  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058897782DNAL7 a10.1007/s11418-017-1153-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSarangowa, Ochir10aBotanical origin of Mei-gui Hua in Chinese markets  ap. 375-380.  aLetter  aThe petals or buds of Rosa species have been used as an important Chinese crude drug called “Mei-gui Hua” and also an ingredient for herbal tea in China. The 15 flavonol glycosides in 34 commercially available “Mei-gui Hua” were quantitatively determined by UPLC, and the data were compared with those of known Rosa sp. belong to Cinnamomeae, Gallicanae, Caninae and Synstylae by principal component analysis for the estimation of original plants of these “Mei-gui Hua”. Seven samples were classified into two groups (Types A and B) composed of species in Gallicae and Synstilae and 11 samples into a group (Type D) composed of species in Cinnamomeae. Six samples were plotted among Types B, C and D. However, nine samples were shown to form a new group (Type F), and the original plants of these samples were assumed to be more complex hybrids of Rosa species including other sections than Cinnamomeae, Gallicanae, Caninae and Synstylae. This method must be useful and convenient to estimate the origin of crude drug “Mei-gui Hua” commercially available in markets. The results of this study also demonstrated that “Mei-gui Hua” commercially available in Chinese market must be prepared from hybrids of various species of Rosa, and it is not reasonable to assign only R. rugosa as scientific name of the origin plants.  aPublisher supplied data  a2015BS0809cNatural Science Foundation of Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, China  aYKD2014KJBW011c"Science and Technology Baiwan Project" Foundation of Inner Mongolian Medical University 3aRosa 3abotanical composition 3abuds 3acorolla 3adrugs 3aflavonols 3aglycosides 3aherbal tea 3ahybrids 3aingredients 3amarkets 3aprincipal component analysis 3aChina1 aNishizawa, Makoto1 aMyoda, Takao1 aMa, Chunjie1 aYamagishi, Takashi0 tNatural medicines.g2018 Jan., v. 72, no. 1 p.375-380dSpringer SingaporewJournal:jnl4059015x1340-34437nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11418-017-1153-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03232naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001800149245015000167300001600317520136100333592002801694596008701722596009801809596012801907650002602035650001702061650001402078650001902092650001302111650001802124650001402142650001302156650003202169653001602201653001002217653001302227653002102240653003202261700005602293700006202349700005602411700005802467773014402525856008402669852000902753655001202762IND60773371320221120112204.0220413e20220331xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077337132DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.estlett.2c001582doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Haotian10aIn-Tube Passive Dosing of Hydrophobic Organic Chemicals: Controlling Freely Dissolved Concentrations in Flow-Through and Large-Volume Experiments  ap. 339-344.  aPassive dosing is increasingly used to control exposure concentrations of hydrophobic organic chemicals (HOCs) in small-sized aquatic tests. This study introduces in-tube passive dosing to control HOC exposure in larger test volumes and flow-through experiments. Water was dosed by passing it through a tube holding HOC-loaded silicone rods. We equipped a 6 m PTFE tube (ID 10 mm) with four parallel silicone rods (OD 3 mm) to accommodate water flows from 0.2 to 120 L/h and developed a mass transfer kinetic model to capture the chemodynamics in the system. The first experiment was conducted with fluoranthene to determine the dosing kinetics, reproducibility, and long-term performance of the system. Aqueous concentrations were measured by molecular fluorescence at different flows and positions within the tube. The second experiment was conducted with a complex petroleum mixture (cracked gas oil). Concentrations of 22 mixture constituents were measured by solid phase microextraction coupled to GC-MS. Overall, the system provided stable and reproducible water concentrations, which were at equilibrium for flows less than 10 mL/min and at steady state for higher flows. Fluoranthene concentrations declined less than 20% when dosing 1 m³ during 1 week. The mass transfer kinetic model can now be used to scale the system for various applications.  aPublisher supplied data  aLRI ECO 42cEuropean Chemical Industry Councildhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100009420  a52039001cNational Natural Science Foundation of Chinadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100001809  a2017YFA0605001cMinistry of Science and Technology of the People's Republic of Chinadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100002855 3aenvironmental science 3afluorescence 3afuel oils 3ahydrophobicity 3akinetics 3amass transfer 3apetroleum 3asilicone 3asolid phase microextraction 0axenobiotics 0aUVCBs 0aexposure 0agenerator system 0amass transfer kinetic model1 aBirch, Heidi1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7152-38321 aSjøholm, Karina K1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2964-38491 aXia, Xinghui1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8663-63461 aMayer, Philipp1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5138-75060 tEnvironmental science & technology letters.g2022 Mar. 31, v. 9, no. 4 p.339-344dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23341x2328-89307nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.estlett.2c001583Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03139naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002100139245009200160300001600252500002000268520182500288592002802113650001802141650002002159650002102179650000902200650001902209650001302228650001102241650002102252650001402273650001302287650001202300650002402312700002302336700002002359700002002379700002002399700002102419700001902440700001802459773012202477856007302599852000902672655001202681IND60587455820221117031928.0180102e201708  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058745582DNAL7 a10.1111/vde.124382doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTarpataki, Noemi14aThe effects of cryopreservation on the expression of canine regulatory T‐cell markers  ap. 396-e93.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aBACKGROUND: Regulatory T (Treg) cells have been described as key regulators in various immunological processes and are of growing interest in veterinary allergy. Cryopreservation of immune cells is performed routinely in human basic science research and in clinical studies. As such, it allows batch testing of collected samples at a single time point, resulting in a significant reduction in sample variability. Data which describe the effects of cryopreservation on Treg cell frequency and functionality in the canine species are important to inform future research. HYPOTHESIS/OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to establish a robust freeze/thaw procedure and flow cytometric staining protocol for canine Treg cells, and to compare the frequencies of different canine Treg cell phenotypes before and after cryopreservation. ANIMALS: Nine privately owned dogs. METHODS: Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were isolated and Treg cells stained and analysed by flow cytometry, before and after three months of cryopreservation. The recovery percentages and the corresponding correlations (fresh versus cryopreserved) for CD4⁺CD25⁺, CD4⁺FOXP3⁺ and CD4⁺CD25⁺FOXP3⁺ cell populations were calculated. RESULTS: A high recovery rate of 97.2 (r = 0.94, P < 0.0001), 93.9 (r = 0.77, P < 0.01) and 101.7% (r = 0.99, P < 0.0001) for CD4⁺CD25⁺, CD4⁺FOXP3⁺ and CD4⁺CD25⁺FOXP3⁺ cell populations, respectively, was observed. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates an optimized protocol for freezing, thawing and quantifying canine Treg cells. These results indicate that cryopreservation does not substantially affect the expression of surface and intracellular markers of canine Treg cells; however, additional studies will be necessary to assess whether functionality of the cells is also maintained.  aPublisher supplied data 3aT-lymphocytes 3aclinical trials 3acryopreservation 3adogs 3aflow cytometry 3afreezing 3ahumans 3ahypersensitivity 3aphenotype 3astaining 3athawing 3aveterinary medicine1 aWawrzyniak, Marcin1 aAkdis, Cezmi A.1 aRückert, Beate1 aMeli, Marina L.1 aFischer, Nina M.1 aFavrot, Claude1 aRostaher, Ana0 tVeterinary dermatology.g2017 Aug., v. 28, no. 4 p.396-e93dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl46684x0959-44937nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/vde.124383Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02643naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001400151245009900165300001800264520122900282592002801511650002101539650001401560650001801574650000901592650002001601650001101621650002601632650002001658650001801678650002101696650002201717653000801739653000801747653001901755653002201774700001501796700001801811700001901829700001301848700002001861700005401881773014401935856008502079852000902164655001202173IND60743303920221121025743.0210707e20210616xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074330392DNAL7 a10.1021/acssuschemeng.1c019622doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhou, Xin12aA Novel Network-Structured Compatibilizer for Improving the Interfacial Behavior of PBS/Lignin  ap. 8592-8602.  aA green poly(butylene succinate) (PBS)–lignin gel compatibilizer with novel network structure was successfully synthesized for the first time via dicumyl peroxide (DCP) initiating free radical grafting of PBS and lignin during melt extrusion. FT-IR confirmed that the PBS and lignin were grafted successfully in the extracted gel. Moreover, the mechanical properties of the gel compatibilizer were greatly affected by the concentration of DCP, and we chose the gel compatibilizer with the best mechanical properties as additives. Thus, the PBS/Lignin/gel compatibilizer alloys (abbreviated to P/L/G) based on PBS, lignin, and gel compatibilizer were obtained. Compared with the PBS/lignin₁₅% blend (P/L), the elongation at break and tensile strength of P/L/G samples increased by 16.7 and 207.8% with the inclusion of 15 wt % gel compatibilizer. Also, the thermal stability, storage modulus, and elastic modulus of the P/L/G samples were simultaneously enhanced as a consequence of the improved interfacial interaction, evidenced by FT-IR and SEM. The study opens up a pathway to improve the compatibility by a novel network-structured gel compatibilizer for fabricating renewable lignin-based biodegradable materials.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiodegradability 3aextrusion 3afree radicals 3agels 3agreen chemistry 3alignin 3amodulus of elasticity 3astorage modulus 3asuccinic acid 3atensile strength 3athermal stability 0aPBS 0aGel 0aCompatibilizer 0aNetwork structure1 aHe, Taizhi1 aJiang, Yinkui1 aChang, Suichao1 aYu, Yang1 aFang, Xiangchen1 aZhang, Yan1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5022-362X0 tACS sustainable chemistry & engineering.g2021 June 16, v. 9, no. 25 p.8592-8602dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23317x2168-04857nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acssuschemeng.1c019623Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02072naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245010500166300001600271520089900287592002801186650001701214650003101231650004301262650001101305650001501316650001401331650001701345650002001362650002401382700001801406700001901424700002001443700001701463773012701480856008201607852000901689655001201698IND60089574020221122043229.0141102e20120511xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008957402DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbrc.2012.04.0462doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Shuaiyu10aAntiangiogenic properties of cafestol, a coffee diterpene, in human umbilical vein endothelial cells  ap. 567-571.  aAs angiogenesis plays important roles in tumor growth and metastasis, searching for antiangiogenic compounds is a promising tactic for treating cancers. Cafestol, a diterpene found mainly in unfiltered coffee, provides benefit through varied biological activity, including antitumorigenic, antioxidative, and anti-inflammatory effects. This study aimed to investigate the effects of cafestol on angiogenesis and to uncover the associated mechanism. We show that cafestol inhibits angiogenesis of human umbilical vascular endothelial cells. This inhibition affects the following specific steps of the angiogenic process: proliferation, migration, and tube formation. The inhibitory effects of cafestol are accompanied by decreasing phosphorylation of FAK and Akt and by a decrease in nitric oxide production. Overall, cafestol inhibits angiogenesis by affecting the angiogenic signaling pathway.  aPublisher supplied data 3aangiogenesis 3aanti-inflammatory activity 3ahuman umbilical vein endothelial cells 3ahumans 3ametastasis 3aneoplasms 3anitric oxide 3aphosphorylation 3asignal transduction1 aYoon, Yeo Cho1 aSung, Mi-Jeong1 aHur, Haeng-Jeon1 aPark, Jae-Ho0 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2012 May 11, v. 421, no. 3 p.567-571dElsevier Inc.x0006-291X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2012.04.0463Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03109naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100003100148245014600179300001600325520156000341592002801901650001501929650002501944650002001969650002801989650002002017650002102037650001502058650002202073650001802095650001802113650000902131650001302140650001302153650001902166650002102185650001102206653002202217653001502239653002602254653002102280653003802301700002402339700001602363700002102379773011102400856008302511852000902594655001202603IND60557325420221119054351.0180831e20170615xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055732542DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bios.2016.10.0422doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHashkavayi, Ayemeh Bagheri10aUltrasensitive electrochemical aptasensor based on sandwich architecture for selective label-free detection of colorectal cancer (CT26) cells  ap. 630-637.  aColorectal cancer is one of the most common cancers in the world and has no effective treatment. Therefore, development of new methods for early diagnosis is instantly required. Biological recognition probes such as synthetic receptor and aptamer is one of the candidate recognition layers to detect important biomolecules. In this work, an electrochemical aptasensor was developed by fabricating an aptamer–cell–aptamer sandwich architecture on an SBA-15-3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane (SBA-15-pr-NH2) and Au nanoparticles (AuNPs) modified graphite screen printed electrode (GSPE) surface for the selective, label-free detection of CT26 cancer cells. Based on the incubation of the thiolated aptamer with CT26 cells, the electron-transfer resistance of Fe (CN)6³⁻/⁴⁻ redox couple increased considerably on the aptasensor surface. The results obtained from cyclic voltammetry and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy studies showed that the fabricated aptasensor can specifically identify CT26 cells in the concentration ranges of 10–1.0×10⁵cells/mL and 1.0×10⁵–6.0×10⁶ cells/mL, respectively, with a detection limit of 2cells/mL. Applying the thiol terminated aptamer (5TR1) as a recognition layer led to a sensor with high affinity for CT26 cancer cells, compared to control cancer cells of AGS cells, VERO Cells, PC3 cells and SKOV-3 cells. Therefore a simple, rapid, label free, inexpensive, excellent, sensitive and selective electrochemical aptasensor based on sandwich architecture was developed for detection of CT26 Cells.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiosensors 3acolorectal neoplasms 3adetection limit 3adielectric spectroscopy 3aearly diagnosis 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrodes 3aelectron transfer 3aferricyanides 3aferrocyanides 3agold 3agraphene 3ananogold 3aneoplasm cells 3aoligonucleotides 3athiols 0aColorectal cancer 0aAptasensor 0aSandwich architecture 0aAu nanoparticles 0aGraphite screen printed electrode1 aRaoof, Jahan Bakhsh1 aOjani, Reza1 aKavoosian, Saeid0 tBiosensors & bioelectronics.g2017 June 15, v. 92 p.630-637dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11631x0956-56637nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bios.2016.10.0423Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02856naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002000139245011100159300001600270500002000286520153300306592002801839650003601867650001501903650002301918650000901941650002001950650001401970650001401984650001301998650001102011650002402022700002102046700002102067700001702088700001602105700001702121700002302138700001902161700002602180773012202206856007302328852000902401655001202410IND60587455920221117031349.0180102e201708  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058745592DNAL7 a10.1111/vde.123792doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKnight, Evie C.10aIn vitro comparison of the dermal penetration of three different topical formulations containing lasalocid  ap. 342-e74.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aBACKGROUND: Topical antimicrobial preparations are of utmost importance in treating suspected and confirmed meticillin‐resistant Staphylococcus pseudintermedius (MRSP) infections due to the increasing incidence of widespread resistance to systemic antimicrobials. Lasalocid is active against MRSP in vitro and this may become an important topical antimicrobial for the treatment of canine pyoderma. HYPOTHESIS/OBJECTIVES: To determine effects of various formulation types on penetration and retention of lasalocid applied to canine skin in vitro. ANIMALS: Normal canine skin was collected from the thorax of five dogs that had been euthanized on the basis of health and/or intractable behavioural issues. METHODS: Solution, lotion and ointment containing 2% lasalocid were applied to ex vivo canine skin. Transdermal penetration was assessed for a 24 h period and retention of lasalocid was assessed at the conclusion of the study. RESULTS: The solution had significantly higher skin retention of lasalocid and proportion of applied dose retained in skin than lotion and ointment (Tukey–Kramer Honest Significant Difference test, P < 0.01). Lasalocid could not be detected in the receptor fluid of any Franz cell at any time point. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: Lasalocid was not identified in the receptor fluid of any sample, indicating that systemic absorption of the active ingredient in vivo is unlikely. Lasalocid may be useful in the treatment of MRSP infections if in vivo studies support safety and efficacy.  aPublisher supplied data 3aStaphylococcus pseudintermedius 3aabsorption 3aactive ingredients 3adogs 3ain vivo studies 3alasalocid 3aointments 3apyoderma 3athorax 3aveterinary medicine1 aTrott, Darren J.1 aPage, Stephen W.1 aGarg, Sanjay1 aZhang, Qian1 aSong, Yunmei1 aEbrahimie, Esmaeil1 aMills, Paul C.1 aShipstone, Michael A.0 tVeterinary dermatology.g2017 Aug., v. 28, no. 4 p.342-e74dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl46684x0959-44937nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/vde.123793Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02809naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001600139245011400155520154200269592002801811650002701839650002701866650002501893650001401918650001401932650002001946650002501966650001301991650001902004650001502023650002502038650001902063650001002082700001502092700001902107700001702126700002102143700002002164773012002184856007402304852000902378655001202387IND60782515220221120193842.0220708e20220704xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078251522DNAL7 a10.3390/w141321292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhou, Qing 14aThe Effect of Algicidal and Denitrifying Bacteria on the Vertical Distribution of Cyanobacteria and Nutrients  aAlgicidal bacteria combined with the ability of aerobic denitrification is considered to be a promising way to control harmful cyanobacterial bloom and remove nitrogen. However, the effect of these bacteria on the vertical distribution of colonial cyanobacteria and nutrients remained unknown. In this study, two algicidal and denitrifying bacteria were respectively co-cultured with the colonial Microcystis aeruginosa to construct the microcosm systems, and then the cyanobacteria number, the ratio of bacterial to cyanobacterial abundance, the content of dissolved nitrogen, phosphorus and organic carbon in different water layers were investigated. The results showed that the distribution difference of Microcystis among the vertical water layers was further enlarged due to the short-term influence of algicidal bacteria Brevundimonas diminuta and Pseudomonas stutzeri. The number of Microcystis in the lower layer was further reduced by the inhibitory effect of the algicidal bacteria. However, there was a dramatic increase in the number of Microcystis in the upper layer, even when the ratio of algicidal bacteria to cyanobacteria increased significantly. B. diminuta and P. stutzeri both greatly promoted the removal of dissolved total nitrogen in the upper and middle layers of cyanobacteria blooming water, but they also boosted the release of dissolved phosphorus in all layers. These results enable us to better understand the possible limitations of algicidal bacteria in their application to control cyanobacteria blooms.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBrevundimonas diminuta 3aMicrocystis aeruginosa 3aPseudomonas stutzeri 3aalgicides 3acoculture 3adenitrification 3adissolved phosphorus 3anitrogen 3aorganic carbon 3aphosphorus 3aspatial distribution 3atotal nitrogen 3awater1 aWang, Yan 1 aWen, Xuezheng 1 aLiu, Haiqin 1 aZhang, Yingying 1 aZhang, Zhiyong 0 tWater.g2022 July 04, v. 14, no. 13dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21688x2073-44417nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w141321293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01759naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094024002200124024001900146040001800165100002100183245006800204300002000272506007600292520071100368592002801079506003701107650002301144650001301167650001901180700002501199773013401224856007801358852000901436655001201445IND60541661020221207144323.0161109e20151118xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054166102DNAL7 a10.1021/jacs.5b086352doi7 aPMC46727432pmcid7 a265497332pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBiswas, Bibaswan10aControlling Selectivity by Controlling the Path of Trajectories  ap. 14244-14247.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aConsideration of the role of dynamic trajectories in [1,2]- and [2,3]-sigmatropic rearrangements suggests a counterintuitive approach to controlling the selectivity. In our hypothesis, [2,3] selectivity can be promoted by reaction conditions that thermodynamically disfavor the [2,3] rearrangement step and thereby make the transition state later. The application of this idea has led to a successful prescription for dictating the selectivity in Stevens/Sommelet-Hauser rearrangements of ammonium ylides. A combination of kinetic isotope effects, crossover experiments, and computational dynamic trajectories support the idea that the selectivity is controlled through control of the path of trajectories.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aammonium compounds 3aisotopes 3athermodynamics1 aSingleton, Daniel A.0 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2015 Nov. 18, v. 137, no. 45 p.14244-14247dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-51267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fjacs.5b086353Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02385naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100006100150245012200211300001400333500001900347520122900366592002801595650001301623650001101636650001401647650001701661651001101678653001501689653003701704653001801741653002401759653001801783700002301801773010501824856008501929852000902014655001202023IND60714145720221122223433.0210408e20210520xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071414572DNAL7 a10.1016/j.quaint.2020.09.0432doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDupont, Catherine1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2323-392610aNew paradigms in the exploitation of Mesolithic shell middens in Atlantic France: The example of Beg-er-Vil, Brittany  ap. 59-71.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe Atlantic coast of north-west France is one of the classic shell-midden regions of the European Mesolithic, made famous by the excavations of Téviec and Hoedic in the first half of the 20th century. At this time, there was a lack of interest in the food refuse component of shell middens. By the end of the 1990s new study methods and techniques had also contributed to a better description of the varied activities of these coastal populations. In Atlantic France, new excavations have demonstrated that shell middens are not a site type but rather one of a variety of stratigraphic units that make up the total settlement pattern. Our perception of the Mesolithic hunter-gatherers of the French Atlantic coast has now changed from a population pre-occupied with day-to-day survival and forced to eat shellfish out of necessity, to fisher-hunter-gatherers involved in varied activities. Their knowledge of marine biotopes is revealed by the diversity of marine animals dedicated to food, but also by the collection of other raw materials washed up on the beach , including flint or shells devoid of flesh. The latter give us access to the symbolic sphere and were clearly and carefully selected for ornamental purposes.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiotopes 3acoasts 3ashellfish 3asolid wastes 3aFrance 0aMesolithic 0aMaritime Fisher-hunter-gatherers 0aShell middens 0aDwelling structures 0aHuman burials1 aMarchand, Grégor,0 tQuaternary international.g2021 May 20, v. 584 p.59-71dElsevier LtdwJournal:12411x1040-61827nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.quaint.2020.09.0433Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01833naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001500147245008600162300001400248520079800262592002801060650002101088650003001109650001501139650001801154650001401172650001101186650002801197650001101225700001701236700001601253700001301269700001501282773008401297856008101381852000901462655001201471IND60121524420221118234449.0150414e201502  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012152442DNAL7 a10.1007/s11262-014-1126-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLin, Fanyu10aCharacterization of white spot syndrome virus VP52B and its interaction with VP26  ap. 46-51.  aWhite spot syndrome virus (WSSV) is one of the major pathogens of cultured shrimp.

Immunogold-electron microscopy revealed that VP52B was located on the outside surface of WSSV virions. Far-Western blotting analysis suggested that VP52B might directly interact with a major viral envelope protein VP26, and their interaction was confirmed by GST pull-down assay. Further investigation showed that the VP52B binding domain was located between residues 135–170 of VP26.

Various management practices have been developed and widely implemented as conservation management strategies to combat water pollution originating from agricultural activities. In the last ten years, there has also been a widespread recognition of the need for nutrient harvesting from wastewaters and resource recovery. In Europe’s Northern Periphery and Arctic (NPA) areas, the expertise in water and runoff management is sporadic and needs to be improved. Therefore, the objective of this research was to perform a comprehensive review of the state of the art of Good Agricultural Practices (GAPs) for the NPA region. A set of questionnaires was distributed to project partners combined with a comprehensive literature review of GAPs focusing on those relevant and/or implemented in the NPA region. Twenty-four GAPs were included in the inventory. This review reveals that there is a large level of uncertainty, inconsistency, and a gap in the knowledge regarding the effectiveness of GAPs in nutrient reduction (NRE), their potential for nutrient recycling and recovery (NRR), and their operation and maintenance requirements (OMR) and costs. Although the contribution of GAPs to water quality improvement could not be quantified, this inventory provides a comprehensive and first-of-its-kind guide on available measures and practices to assist regional and local authorities and communities in the NAP region. A recommendation for incorporating and retrofitting phosphorus retaining media (PRMs) in some of the GAPs, and/or the implementation of passive filtration systems and trenches filled with PRMs to intercept surface and subsurface farm flows, would result in the enhancement of both NRE and NRR.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural runoff 3afarms 3afiltration 3ainventories 3aphosphorus 3auncertainty 3awastewater 3awater pollution 3awater quality 3aArctic region 3aEurope1 aJohnston, Chris 1 aJón Guðmundsson,0 tWater.g2022 July 04, v. 14, no. 13dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21688x2073-44417nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w141321323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02262naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002400140245007800164520115900242592002801401650002601429650002701455650001101482650001901493650001101512650001101523650001101534650001301545650001701558650002201575651001401597700002701611700001901638700002001657773012801677856007401805852000901879655001201888IND60652608620221122084612.0190713e20180914xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065260862DNAL7 a10.3390/su100932802doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPearce, Tristan  D.10aHow Is Australia Adapting to Climate Change Based on a Systematic Review?  aWe develop and apply a systematic literature review methodology to identify and characterize the ways in which the peer-reviewed literature depicts how climate change adaptation is occurring in Australia. We reviewed the peer-reviewed, English-language literature between January 2005 and January 2018 for examples of documented human adaptation initiatives in Australia. Our results challenge previous assumptions that adaptation actions are not happening in Australia and describes adaptation processes that are underway. For the most part, actions can be described as preliminary or groundwork, with a particular focus on documenting stakeholder perspectives on climate change and attitudes towards adaptation, and modelling or scenario planning in the coastal zone, agriculture, and health sectors. Where concrete adaptations are reported, they are usually in the agricultural sector and are most common in the Murray&ndash;Darling Basin, Australia&rsquo;s food basket. The findings of the review advance our understanding of adaptation to climate change as a process and the need to consider different stages in the process when tracking adaptation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural industry 3aattitudes and opinions 3abasins 3aclimate change 3acoasts 3ahumans 3amodels 3aplanning 3astakeholders 3asystematic review 3aAustralia1 aRodríguez, Evelyn  H.1 aFawcett, David1 aFord, James D.,0 tSustainability.g2018 Sept. 14, v. 10, no. 9dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2270x2071-10507nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su100932803Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02650naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002300139245013900162520147700301592002801778650002301806650001501829650001901844650001001863650000701873650001501880650002001895650001101915650001501926650002601941650001301967651001401980700002201994700002502016700002002041773012002061856007402181852000902255655001202264IND60782515520221120172756.0220708e20220704xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078251552DNAL7 a10.3390/w141321352doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKuster, Anthony C.10aField Application of Spent Lime Water Treatment Residual for the Removal of Phosphorus and other Pollutants in Urban Stormwater Runoff  aThe threat of anthropogenic eutrophication and harmful algal blooms in lakes requires the development of innovative stormwater best management practices (BMPs) to reduce the external loading of phosphorus (P). This paper presents the findings of a 5-year study of a full-scale P removal structure constructed in Minnesota, USA with spent lime drinking water treatment residual (DWTR), a by-product of water softening at a local water treatment plant. Influent and effluent water samples were collected by auto-samplers during 43 storm events during the growing season. Samples were analyzed for P constituents, heavy metals, total suspended solids (TSS), and pH. Toxicity of the effluent was assessed using Ceriodaphnia dubia. Flow-weighted removal effectiveness was calculated for each storm event. Overall, the spent lime DWTR reduced total P loading by 70.9%, dissolved reactive P by 78.5%, dissolved P by 74.7%, and TSS by 58.5%. A significant reduction in heavy metals was also observed. Toxicity tests indicated the aquatic toxicity of the effluent treated with spent lime DWTR was not different from untreated stormwater. This study provided long-term real-world data that demonstrated that a full-scale P removal structure with spent lime DWTR significantly reduced P and other pollutants in stormwater discharging to an urban lake. Therefore, spent lime DWTR, which is currently treated as a waste product, is a promising filter material for stormwater treatment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCeriodaphnia dubia 3abyproducts 3aeutrophication 3alakes 3apH 3aphosphorus 3apoisonous algae 3astorms 3astormwater 3astormwater management 3atoxicity 3aMinnesota1 aPilgrim, Keith M.1 aKuster, Anootnara T.1 aHuser, Brian J.0 tWater.g2022 July 04, v. 14, no. 13dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21688x2073-44417nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w141321353Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01285naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001400140245007100154300002000225520018400245592002800429650001200457650002700469650002300496650002300519650001400542650001300556650000700569700002000576700001700596700001800613700001800631700002300649700001900672773013600691856007500827852000900902655001200911IND60659128320221119125120.0190827e20111031xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065912832DNAL7 a10.1039/c1cc15474e2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Lin10aSalt-induced hydrogelation of functionalised-dipeptides at high pH  ap. 12071-12073.  aAddition of divalent cations to a solution of a naphthalene-diphenylalanine that forms worm-like micelles at high pH results in the formation of a rigid, self-supporting hydrogel.  aPublisher supplied data 3acations 3achemical communication 3achemical compounds 3achemical reactions 3ahydrogels 3amicelles 3apH1 aPont, Guillaume1 aMorris, Kyle1 aLotze, Gudrun1 aSquires, Adam1 aSerpell, Louise C.1 aAdams, Dave J.0 tChemical communications.g2011 Oct. 31, v. 47, no. 44 p.12071-12073dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26910x1364-548X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c1cc15474e3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03203naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002500150245010500175300001400280500001900294520186100313592002802174650001602202650001302218650001502231650001702246650001402263650001502277651001002292653002102302653002002323653002002343653002502363700001802388700002102406700001902427700006002446700001802506700001702524700001702541773010502558856008502663852000902748655001202757IND60714146020221117230008.0210415e20210530xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071414602DNAL7 a10.1016/j.quaint.2020.09.0462doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGill, Hitander Singh10aActive transfer faulting in the NW Sub-Himalaya (India) observed by space-borne topographic analyses  ap. 15-26.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe results of surface morphology and InSAR analyses carried out along a NNE-SSW oriented (~7 km-long) transfer fault are presented. This structure actively accommodates differential motion across two blocks in the western Sub-Himalayan belt of India. Segmentation is most pronounced in this sector of the accretionary wedge, where minimal climatic variations and a three-fold sub-division (Kangra Renetrant-Nahan Salient-Dehradun Reentrant) are well recognized. Segmentation is here clearly elucidated by variation in surface topography, geologic structure and recorded seismicity over the last few decades. However, the transition from one segment to another is poorly documented and understood. This article primarily documents surface topography and drainage anomalies within the transition zone between the Kangra Reentrant and the Nahan Salient through the study of space imageries spanning nearly six-decades (i.e. early 1960's to present). Geomorphic observations and InSAR analyses demonstrate that the segmentation is largely governed by lateral variation in geological structure, deformation patterns and mechanical stratigraphy and accommodated by transverse movement along the transfer fault. It should be noted that transfer faults commonly represent a privileged pathway for the major drainage and therefore surface manifestations are rarely preserved, e.g. Yamuna Tear, Ganga Tear etc. A rare instance of preserved surface topography associated with the recent activity along the Sabilpur transfer fault at the transition between the Kangra Renetrant and the Nahan Salient is documented here. Our investigations demonstrate that the Sabilpur Active Fault (SAF) accommodates differential tectonic convergence between the two blocks predominantly by left-lateral strike-slip kinematics with a component of uplift related to thrusting at HFT.  aPublisher supplied data 3adeformation 3adrainage 3akinematics 3astratigraphy 3atectonics 3atopography 3aIndia 0aActive tectonics 0aTransfer faults 0aNW Sub-himalaya 0aTopographic analyses1 aTejpal Singh,1 aSingh, Sarabjeet1 aKim, Jung-Rack1 aCaputo, Riccardo1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8884-89911 aGurmeet Kaur,1 aSingh, Seema1 aKhosla, Ashu0 tQuaternary international.g2021 May 30, v. 585 p.15-26dElsevier LtdwJournal:12411x1040-61827nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.quaint.2020.09.0463Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02541naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100006100153245006900214300001600283520128100299592002801580650001001608650001701618650001001635650001201645650002201657650001301679650001001692650001301702650001301715650001401728653002401742653002101766653003101787653002801818700002201846700002001868700002301888773011101911856008802022852000902110655001202119IND60571046020221119045505.0180830e201708  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057104602DNAL7 a10.1016/j.forsciint.2017.05.0172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPlenzig, Stefanie1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8312-723910aPost-operative fatal blood aspiration after routine lung surgery  ap. e11-e15.  aA routine question encountered in medicolegal practice is whether the death of a patient in proximity to a surgical procedure is due to medical malpractice. The case of a 62-year-old man who died two weeks after undergoing a VATS sleeve resection of the upper right lung lobe in conjunction with radical lymphadenectomy, a routine surgical procedure, is reported. To address the issue of medical malpractice, a forensic autopsy was ordered by the investigative authority. During the autopsy, the lungs were removed as a whole and fixed in formalin and were later dissected in cooperation with a thoracic surgeon. In the course of this dissection, a bronchovascular fistula, which had led to the occlusion of the bronchial system with clotted blood, was discovered. Bronchovascular fistulas are a rare complication of bronchial sleeve resections. Because this surgical complication is essentially always fatal, it is highly pertinent to medicolegal practice. The presented case report also lists other important complications associated with bronchial anastomosis and elucidates a pragmatic approach to obtaining an expert clinical assessment of possible medical malpractice after operations through the example of a dissection performed in cooperation with a thoracic surgeon.  aPublisher supplied data 3ablood 3acase studies 3adeath 3afistula 3aforensic sciences 3aformalin 3alungs 3anecropsy 3apatients 3aresection 0aMedical malpractice 0aBlood aspiration 0aBronchial sleeve resection 0aBronchovascular fistula1 aSoriano, Mauricio1 aHeld, Hannelore1 aVerhoff, Marcel A.0 tForensic science international.g2017 Aug., v. 277 p.e11-e15dElsevier B.V.wJournal:3523x0379-07387nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.forsciint.2017.05.0173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02515naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001800139245011600157520132500273592002801598650001001626650001201636650001901648650001201667650003101679650001401710650001001724650001801734650001401752650001501766650001501781650001101796650001001807700002401817700001801841700002201859700002101881773012001902856007402022852000902096655001202105IND60782515620221120172730.0220708e20220705xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078251562DNAL7 a10.3390/w141321362doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPage, Maycee 10aFilamentous Algae Blooms in a Large, Clear-Water Lake: Potential Drivers and Reduced Benthic Primary Production  aAn apparent proliferation of filamentous algal blooms (FABs) in pristine lakes around the world is a source of concern. However, little is known about the predominant drivers and effects of such FABs on lake ecosystems. We observed FABs in a large clear-water lake (Bear Lake, UT/ID, USA) and analyzed long-term lake monitoring data and algal stable isotopes for changes in climate, food webs and anthropogenic nutrient loading, respectively, as potential local drivers of FAB formation. Furthermore, we quantified in situ metabolism rates on rocks with and without FABs at two locations. Long-term monitoring data revealed increasing summer water temperatures (2009 to 2020) and decreasing winter ice cover (1923 to 2021). The FABs had δ¹⁵N values that were higher than 0 ‰, indicating a potential nutrient influx to Bear Lake from livestock or human waste. Climate change and anthropogenic nutrients may thus have facilitated FAB occurrence. Contrary to expectation, the FABs exhibited significantly lower gross primary production rates compared to low-biomass periphyton communities, indicating potentially negative effects of FAB proliferations on lake food webs. Our results highlight the need for expanding lake monitoring programs to include littoral zones to detect and mitigate changes occurring in lakes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgae 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3aexcreta 3agross primary productivity 3aice cover 3alakes 3alittoral zone 3alivestock 3ametabolism 3aperiphyton 3asummer 3awater1 aGoldhammer, Tobias 1 aHilt, Sabine 1 aTolentino, Scott 1 aBrothers, Soren 0 tWater.g2022 July 05, v. 14, no. 13dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21688x2073-44417nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w141321363Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01480naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001900145245011400164300001800278520031400296592002800610650001700638650002200655650002300677650002300700650002200723700001600745700002000761700001500781700001700796700001500813700005600828700001200884773013400896856007901030852000901109655001201118IND60605126620221120193947.0180720e20180426xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060512662DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.joc.8b002292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJin, Xiao-Yang10aRuthenium-Catalyzed Decarboxylative C–H Alkenylation in Aqueous Media: Synthesis of Tetrahydropyridoindoles  ap. 7514-7522.  aWe disclose herein a Ru(II)-catalyzed decarboxylative and oxidative coupling of N-substituted indolyl carboxylic acids with broad substrate scope in an aqueous solution.

The RB J-aggregate with a slippage angle θ = 30.4°, estimated from the monomeric transition dipole moment directions, exhibited a broad fwhm of 1073 cm–¹ and a 5 nm red-shifted absorption band carrying a transition dipole moment (M⃗λₐgg = 1.80 D) almost equivalent to the monomeric dye (M⃗λₘₒₙ = 1.89 D). A significantly low magnitude of exciton coupling energy, ΔEₑₓc = −358 cm–¹ for the rhombic-RB colloidal J-aggregates resulted owing to the weaker electronic communication between the largely separated RB subunits (r = 7.2 Å) and a restricted exciton delocalization over the RB J-dimer (N = 2). The RB J-dimer exhibited a perfect balance between the computed singlet (2.53 eV) and the triplet (1.29 eV) exciton energies for singlet fission (SF). Supporting this, the PL decay profile of the J-aggregates revealed a delayed fluorescence, substantiating triplet pair formation via SF. The experimental evidence for the long-lived triplet formation was furthermore confirmed by its transient absorption (T₁ → TN) at 530 nm. Consequently, a high probability for SF and a low probability for triplet–triplet recombination, leading to a dramatic lowering in photoluminescence quantum yield from 0.172 down to 0.035 was noted. The electronic structure calculations for the RB J-dimer followed TD-DFT-M062X/6-31G+(d,p) level of theory following integral equation formalism polarizable continuum model (IEFPCM) in water. S₁ excited state for RB J-dimer was carefully analyzed using integral overlap of electron and hole density distribution (ϕ) and the defined t-indexes along all three spatial directions, and was found to be of locally excited in character.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3aenergy 3aequations 3afluorescence 3amodels 3aphotoluminescence 3aprobability 3aspectroscopy1 aPatnaik, Archita0 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2017 Apr. 13, v. 121, no. 14 p.3190-3201dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-52077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.jpcb.7b020723Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02901naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002100139245012100160300001600281500002000297520178000317592002802097650001402125650000902139650001902148650001402167650000902181650001402190650001802204650001302222650002302235651001802258700002602276700002102302773012202323856007302445852000902518655001202527IND60587456220221117031028.0180102e201708  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058745622DNAL7 a10.1111/vde.124262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTater, Kathy Chu10aAllergen‐specific immunotherapy prescription patterns in veterinary practice: a US population‐based cohort study  ap. 362-e82.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aBACKGROUND: Poor adherence to continuing allergen‐specific immunotherapy treatment (ASIT) may be an issue in veterinary medicine. No studies describe how allergen tests are used in general veterinary practice, including the percentage of patients that receive ASIT after allergen testing. HYPOTHESIS/OBJECTIVES: Assess veterinary ASIT patterns in United States general practices. ANIMALS: Dogs (n = 2,557) and 121 cats allergen‐tested at 177 hospitals (173 general practice and four specialty practices) in 44 states. METHODS: Invoiced service descriptions of allergen tests and ASIT orders were retrieved from an aggregated database of veterinary practices. RESULTS: In general practice, 42% (992 of 2,360) of patients did not begin ASIT after allergen testing. ASIT was not refilled for 29% (398 of 1,368) of patients after the initial order. ASIT was initiated and refilled more often in dogs (56.6%, 71.4%, respectively) than cats (38%, 67.4%). Specialty practice patients had the highest ASIT initiation (94.4%) and refill (92.7%) percentages in comparison to general practices (P < 0.001). Size, age, geographical region and type of practice were associated with whether dogs were started on ASIT. Geographical region was also associated with refilling a prescription for ASIT, which was considered to be evidence of adherence to continuing treatment. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: Almost one third of clients failed to continue ASIT beyond the initial order, which is a much shorter duration of therapy than the 12 months recommended for determining ASIT efficacy. A large number of general practice patients did not begin ASIT after allergen testing, likely due to differences in how clinicians in general and dermatology practices use allergen tests.  aPublisher supplied data 3aallergens 3acats 3acohort studies 3adatabases 3adogs 3ahospitals 3aimmunotherapy 3apatients 3aveterinary clinics 3aUnited States1 aCole, William Elliott1 aPion, Paul David0 tVeterinary dermatology.g2017 Aug., v. 28, no. 4 p.362-e82dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl46684x0959-44937nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/vde.124263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02903naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100002600188245010400214300001400318506007600332520135900408592002801767506003701795650001601832650000901848650002501857650001501882650001301897650001401910650001101924650000901935650001301944650004401957650002202001650003702023700002102060700002002081700002002101700002302121700001902144700002202163700002002185773011302205856008202318852000902400655001202409IND60588978420221207091950.0200423e201801  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058897842DNAL7 a10.1007/s11418-017-1109-22doi7 aPMC64599692pmcid7 a288220302pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNugroho, Alfarius Eko10aCeramicines M–P from Chisocheton ceramicus: isolation and structure–activity relationship study  ap. 64-72.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aCeramicines are a series of limonoids which were isolated from the bark of Malaysian Chisocheton ceramicus (Meliaceae) and show various biological activities. Ceramicine B, in particular, has been reported to show a strong lipid droplet accumulation (LDA) inhibitory activity on a mouse pre-adipocyte cell line (MC3T3-G2/PA6). With the purpose of discovering compounds with stronger activity than ceramicine B, we further investigated the constituents of C. ceramicus. As a result, from the bark of C. ceramicus four new ceramicines (ceramicines M–P, 1–4) were isolated, and their structures were determined on the basis of NMR and mass spectroscopic analyses in combination with NMR chemical shift calculations. LDA inhibitory activity of 1–4 was evaluated. Compounds 1–3 showed LDA inhibitory activity, and 3 showed better selectivity than ceramicine B while showing activity at the same order of magnitude as ceramicine B. Since 3, which possess a carbonyl group at C-7, showed better selectivity than 5, which possess a 7α-OH group, while showing activity at the same order of magnitude as 5, we also investigated the effect of the substituent at C-7 by synthesizing several derivatives and evaluating their LDA inhibitory activity. Accordingly, we confirmed the importance of the presence of a 7α-OH group to the LDA inhibitory activity.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aChisocheton 3abark 3abioactive properties 3acell lines 3adroplets 3alimonoids 3alipids 3amice 3amoieties 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aspectral analysis 3astructure-activity relationships1 aHashimoto, Akiyo1 aWong, Chin-Piow1 aYokoe, Hiromasa1 aTsubuki, Masayoshi1 aKaneda, Toshio1 aHadi, A.

A detailed mechanistic investigation of this reaction is presented, which involves a combination of several methods such as EPR, ESI-MS, X-ray, in situ IR kinetics, and DFT calculations. Our findings reveal that C–C bond formation is turnover-limiting and occurs by a catalyst-controlled radical combination involving two titanium(III) species. The resting state is identified as a cationic titanocene-nitrile complex and the beneficial effect of added Et₃N·HCl on yield and enantioselectivity is elucidated: chloride coordination initiates the radical coupling. The results are fundamental for the understanding of titanium(III)-catalysis and of relevance for other metal-catalyzed radical reactions. Our conclusions might apply to a number of reductive coupling reactions for which conventional mechanisms were proposed before.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-radiation 3achemical bonding 3achlorides 3aelectrospray ionization mass spectrometry 3aenantiomers 3ahydrochloric acid 3aketones 3anitriles 3astereochemistry 3atitanium 3atrimethylamine1 aFeurer, Markus1 aFrey, Georg1 aSteffani, Alberto1 aKacprzak, Sylwia1 aWeweler, Jens1 aLeijendekker, Leonardus

Bees are known to respond to and learn multimodal and multicomponent floral cues, whereas, historically, studies of learning in butterflies have focused on a single visual stimulus component, most often color. In this study, we examine whether Monarch butterflies (Danaus plexippus L.) can learn to associate a compound visual stimulus, i.e., color and shape together, with a nectar reward. We also examine the relative importance of color and shape as cues for foraging butterflies. Our results indicate that within the visual modality, foraging Monarchs learn color more readily than shape. Monarchs, however, are capable of learning to associate shape with a sugar reward independent of color, and they may also be capable of learning the compound stimulus of color and shape in the context of foraging. We suggest that the hierarchical importance of cues is likely to vary depending on ecological context, and that although color may be most relevant for a nectar-foraging butterfly, shape may be a more useful cue for a butterfly searching for an oviposition substrate.  aPublisher supplied data 3aApoidea 3aDanaus plexippus 3abutterflies 3acolor 3aflowers 3aforaging 3ainsect behavior 3alearning 3anectar 3aodors 3aoviposition 3apollinators 3asugars1 aRosenwald, Laura C.1 aWeiss, Martha R.0 tJournal of insect behavior.g2015 July, v. 28, no. 4 p.499-511dSpringer USx0892-75537nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10905-015-9519-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02541naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024003600110040001800146100001900164245010400183300001600287520119800303592002801501650000901529650001001538650001601548650001501564650002001579650001601599650001201615650002101627650002801648650000901676650001101685650003801696650002801734650002101762650003801783650004301821650000901864650002501873773010601898852000902004856008202013655001202095IND8602808820221120222344.0181009e198509  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND860280882DNAL7 a40496722pmid7 a10.1177/0300985885022005012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBergman, J.

Macroscopically visible nodules were present in 35 of 50 dogs (70%), and the prevalence was related to age. The earliest age at which nodules were found was between 6 and 8 years. They were present in all dogs older than 14 or more years. The lesions were focal, multiple and consistently had evidence of a lobular pattern. There was no liver fibrosis. No direct association between previous drug administration or specific extrahepatic disease was found. Changes in the perisinusoidal fat storing cells (Ito cells) were observed in the dogs in this study. These changes comprised proliferation and hypertrophy and were recorded predominantly in dogs with hepatic nodules. The presence of a ceroid pigment was correlated with these changes. The pigment, together with lipid and macrophages, was present in the form of lipogranulomata. Lipogranulomata were observed in the parenchyma and in the portal areas of dogs with hepatic nodules. These changes may play a role in the pathogenesis of nodular hyperplasia in the liver of the dog.  aPublisher supplied data 3adogs 3aliver 3ahyperplasia 3amicroscopy 3acell structures 2aAge Factors 2aAnimals 2aCeroidxanalysis 2aDog Diseasesxpathology 2aDogs 2aFemale 2aGranulomaxpathologyxveterinary. 2aHyperplasiaxveterinary 2aLipidsxanalysis 2aLiverxpathologyxultrastructure. 2aLiver Diseasesxpathologyxveterinary. 2aMale 2aMicroscopy, Electron0 tVeterinary pathology.g, v. 22, no. 5 p.427-438dSAGE PublicationswJournal:jnl13945x1544-22177nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0300985885022005013Available from publisher's site 7aarticle02235naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100003500155245007000190520105100260592002801311650002401339650002201363650001501385650001501400650001701415650002201432650001801454650002501472653002001497653001501517653004201532653002101574653001801595700002301613700002301636773009101659856009001750852000901840655001201849IND60741679520221120051605.0210904e202111  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074167952DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2021.1311512doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVivekanand, Aashlesha Chekkala10aMicroplastics in aquatic environment: Challenges and perspectives  aThe occurrence of microplastics in the aquatic environment has become a growing concern globally. Microplastics pose a hazard to the ecological system, and their presence, particularly in the water, has an adverse impact on human health and the ecosystem. Microplastics are released into the environment directly from everyday used plastic items, degradation of plastics, industries, and wastewater treatment plants. Once these contaminants enter the water, aquatic life feeds on them, and microplastics enter the food chain and cause severe health hazards. An assessment of microplastics' ecological risks is essential; however, it is challenging in the present scenario due to limited information available. To fill these knowledge gaps, this paper comprehensively reviews the sources and transport of microplastics in the water environment and their environmental and health effects, global policy frameworks, analytical techniques for microplastic detection, and control strategies to prevent microplastics release in the aquatic environment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaquatic environment 3aaquatic organisms 3aecosystems 3afood chain 3ahuman health 3aissues and policy 3amicroplastics 3awastewater treatment 0aAquatic ecology 0aFood chain 0aHuman and environmental health hazard 0aEcological risks 0aMicroplastics1 aMohapatra, Sanjeeb1 aTyagi, Vinay Kumar0 tChemosphere.g2021 Nov., v. 282 p.131151-dElsevier LtdwJournal:1969x0045-65357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2021.1311513Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03136naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245015300166300001600319520195600335592002802291650001802319650001302337650001402350650001402364650001202378650001302390650002002403650001002423650002002433650001402453650001402467650001902481650001602500700001802516700001702534773009702551856008102648852000902729655001202738IND60439852720221120165557.0151024e201507  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6043985272DNAL7 a10.1007/s10905-015-9509-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSevgili, Hasan10aMating Behavior and Spermatophore Characteristics in Two Closely Related Bushcricket Species of the Genus Phonochorion (Orthoptera: Phaneropterinae)  ap. 369-386.  aBushcrickets comprise an important group of model organisms, which are intensively studied to understand the evolution of mating behavior. During the mating process, the male bushcricket transfers a costly and edible spermatophore consisting of two parts to the female. This unique behavior makes bushcricket species appropriate study organisms for investigating spermatophore size variations across entire bushcricket family (Tettigoniidae). The functions of the spermatophylax and the ampulla, which constitute the spermatophore, have been addressed in many studies. Although the costs and benefits of mating for male and female bushcrickets may vary depending on species, there are some common evolutionary traits. In the present study, mating behaviors and spermatophore characteristics of two endemic bushcricket species, Phonochorion uvarovi and P. artvinensis, distributed at the high altitudes of the Kaçkar Mountains, northeastern Turkey, were examined. The data on two closely related species belonging to the genus of Phonochorion show that they have different reproductive investments in terms of spermatophore and sperm numbers in spite of similar habitat and nutritional preferences. P. artvinensis had a larger spermatophore, spermatophylax and ampulla, but transferred fewer sperm. Male age and weight had a significant effect on spermatophore, spermatophylax and ampulla investments in P. uvarovi while only male weight was a significant factor in P. artvinensis. A positive relationship between the spermatophylax and the ampulla weights in both species supports the ejaculate protection hypothesis in the Phonochorion species. Even though further studies on Phonochorion should be conducted to provide a more clear comparison with other groups in the barbitistine, this study demonstrates that both P. uvarovi and P. artvinensis make little spermatophore investment relative to their body size in comparison to other barbitistines.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTettigoniidae 3aaltitude 3abody size 3aevolution 3afemales 3ahabitats 3ainsect behavior 3amales 3amating behavior 3amountains 3aorganisms 3aspermatophores 3aspermatozoa1 aÖnal, Hülya1 aYiğit, Arzu0 tJournal of insect behavior.g2015 July, v. 28, no. 4 p.369-386dSpringer USx0892-75537nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10905-015-9509-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03252naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002200151245019400173300001600367520168300383592002802066650002602094650001502120650001902135650001502154650002602169650002602195650001902221650001102240650002602251650003102277650001802308650001602326653001802342653002602360653003102386653001202417653001102429700002102440700002502461700002102486700002202507700002002529700002302549773009202572856008502664852000902749655001202758IND60603233120221119201626.0180713e20150301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060323312DNAL7 a10.1016/j.talanta.2014.11.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMarques, Aline S.10aRapid discrimination of klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase 2 – producing and non-producing klebsiella pneumoniae strains using near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) and multivariate analysis  ap. 126-131.  aKlebsiella pneumoniae Carbapenemase (KPC–2)-producing and non-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae (KP) have rapidly disseminated worldwide, challenging the diagnostics of Gram-negative infections. We evaluate the potential of a novel non-destructive and rapid method based on Near-Infrared Spectroscopic (NIRS) and multivariate analysis for distinguishing KPC-2 – producing and non-producing KP. Thirty-nine NIRS spectra (24 KPC-2-producing KP, 15 KPC-2 non-producing KP) were acquired; different pre-processing methods such as baseline correction, derivative and Savitzky–Golay smoothing were performed. A spectral region fingerprint was achieved after using genetic algorithm–linear discriminant analysis (GA–LDA) and successive projection algorithm (SPA–LDA) algorithms for variable selection. The variables selected were then used for discriminating the microorganisms.Accuracy test results including sensitivity and specificity were determined. Sensitivity in KPC-2 producing and non-producing KP categories was 66.7% and 75%, respectively, using a SPA-LDA model with 66 wavenumbers. The resulting GA-LDA model successfully classified both microorganisms with respect to their “fingerprints” using only 39 wavelengths. Sensitivity in KPC-2 producing category was moderate(≈66.7%) using a GA-LDA model. However, sensitivity in KPC-2 non-producing category using GA-LDA accurately predicted the correct class (with 100% accuracy). As100% accuracy was achieved, this novel approach identifies potential biochemical markers that may have a relation with microbial functional roles and means of rapid identification of KPC-2 producing and non-producing KP strains.  aPublisher supplied data 3aKlebsiella pneumoniae 3aalgorithms 3abeta-lactamase 3abiomarkers 3adiagnostic techniques 3adiscriminant analysis 3amicroorganisms 3amodels 3amultivariate analysis 3anear-infrared spectroscopy 3arapid methods 3awavelengths 0aCarbapenemase 0aKlebsiella pneumoniae 0aNear infrared spectroscopy 0aSPA-LDA 0aGA-LDA1 aMoraes, Edgar P.1 aJúnior, Miguel A.A.1 aMoura, Andrew D.1 aNeto, Valter F.A.1 aNeto, Renato M.1 aLima, Kássio M.G.0 tTalanta.g2015 Mar. 01, v. 134 p.126-131dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11742x0039-91407nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.talanta.2014.11.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03026naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245011600167300001600283520163300299592002801932650002101960650001801981650001401999650001902013650001502032650001602047650002002063650001902083650001002102650001902112650001102131650001802142650000902160650001302169650001402182650002202196650001002218650001402228700001802242700001802260700001702278700001902295700001602314773011202330856008102442852000902523655001202532IND60548246020221116170810.0160903e201608  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054824602DNAL7 a10.1007/s11626-016-0026-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKim, Young June10aComplete reduction of p53 expression by RNA interference following heterozygous knockout in porcine fibroblasts  ap. 736-741.  aTumor suppressor p53 plays a critical role in the regulation of cell cycle and apoptosis in mammals. Mutations of p53 often cause various cancers. Murine models have improved our understanding on tumorigenesis associated with p53 mutations. However, mice and humans are different in many ways. For example, the short lifespans of mice limit the clinical application of the data obtained from this species. Porcine model could be an alternative as pigs share many anatomical and physiological similarities with humans. Here, we modified the expression levels of p53 messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein in porcine fetal fibroblasts using a combination of gene targeting and RNA interference. First, we disrupted the p53 gene to produce p53 knockout (KO) cells. Second, the p53 shRNA expression vector was introduced into fibroblasts to isolate p53 knockdown (KD) cells. We obtained p53 KO, KD, and KO + KD fibroblasts which involve p53 KO and KD either separately or simultaneously. The mRNA expression of p53 in p53 KO fibroblasts was similar to that in the wild-type control. However, the mRNA expression levels of p53 in KD and KO + KD cells were significantly decreased. The p53 protein level significant reduced in p53 KD. Interestingly, no p53 protein was detected in KO + KD, suggesting a complete reduction of the protein by synergistic effect of KO and KD. This study demonstrated that various expression levels of p53 in porcine fibroblasts could be achieved by gene targeting and RNA interference. Moreover, complete abolishment of protein expression is feasible using a combination of gene targeting and RNA interference.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRNA interference 3aanimal models 3aapoptosis 3acarcinogenesis 3acell cycle 3afibroblasts 3agene expression 3agene targeting 3agenes 3aheterozygosity 3ahumans 3amessenger RNA 3amice 3amutation 3aneoplasms 3aprotein synthesis 3aswine 3asynergism1 aKim, Tae-Hyun1 aKim, Minjeong1 aKim, Min-ju,1 aKim, Hae-wŏn,1 aShim, Hosup0 tIn vitro cellular & developmental biology.g2016 Aug., v. 52, no. 7 p.736-741dSpringer USx1071-26907nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11626-016-0026-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02842naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100001800166245010100184300001600285520104600301592002801347650001601375650002501391650001001416650001101426650003501437650001301472650001401485650001301499650002401512650001201536650003701548650002501585650001101610650002801621650002101649650006901670650001401739650003901753650003201792650002301824650005501847653000901902653003401911653001501945653001301960653002601973700001501999700001702014700001302031700001802044773010002062856008102162852000902243655001202252IND60113428820221119125858.0161024e20130820xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011342882DNAL7 a239692492pmid7 a10.1016/j.jgg.2013.04.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Xinmin10aEvolutionary and Functional Analysis of the Key Pluripotency Factor Oct4 and Its Family Proteins  ap. 399-412.  aOct4 is one of the key pluripotent factors essential for embryonic stem cells and induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells. Oct4 belongs to the POU domain family, which contains multiples genes with various important functions. Although the function of Oct4 has been extensively studied, detailed comparison of Oct4 with other POU family genes and their evolutionary analysis are still lacking. Here, we systematically identified POU family genes from lower to higher animal species. We observed an expansion of POU family genes in vertebrates, with an additional increment in mammalian genomes. We analyzed the phylogenetic relationship, tissue specific expression profiles and regulatory networks of POU family genes of the human genome, and predicted the putative binding microRNAs of human POU family genes. These results provide the first comprehensive evolutionary and comparative analysis of POU family genes, which will help to better understand the relationships among POU family genes and shed light on their future functional studies.  aPublisher supplied data 3acorrelation 3aembryonic stem cells 3agenes 3ahumans 3ainduced pluripotent stem cells 3amicroRNA 3aphylogeny 3aproteins 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aAnimals 2aEmbryonic Stem Cellsxmetabolism 2aEvolution, Molecular 2aHumans 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aMultigene Family 2aOctamer Transcription Factor-3xchemistryxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aPhylogeny 2aPluripotent Stem Cellsxmetabolism 2aProtein Structure, Tertiary 2aSequence Alignment 2aVertebratesxclassificationxgeneticsxmetabolism. 0aOct4 0aInduced pluripotent stem cell 0aPOU family 0aMicroRNA 0aEvolutionary analysis1 aMa, Yuzhen1 aLiu, Xiuying1 aZhou, Qi1 aWang, Xiu-Jie0 tJournal of genetics and genomics.g2013 Aug. 20, v. 40 p.399-412dElsevier Ltdx1673-85277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jgg.2013.04.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03252naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002200151245025400173300001500427520154600442592002801988650001702016650001602033650003902049650001902088650001602107650003302123650001402156650001302170650001302183650000902196650001802205650001502223650002702238650001302265653001702278653004702295653005402342653003902396653004302435700002502478700002102503700002202524700002702546773009102573856008502664852000902749655001202758IND60603233220221119201107.0180713e20150301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060323322DNAL7 a10.1016/j.talanta.2014.11.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAmoli-Diva, Mitra10aApplication of dispersive liquid–liquid microextraction coupled with vortex-assisted hydrophobic magnetic nanoparticles based solid-phase extraction for determination of aflatoxin M1 in milk samples by sensitive micelle enhanced spectrofluorimetry  ap. 98-104.  aAn efficient, simple and fast low-density solvent based dispersive liquid–liquid microextraction (LDS-DLLME) followed by vortex-assisted dispersive solid phase extraction (VA-D-SPE) has been developed as a new approach for extraction and preconcentration of aflatoxin M1 in milk samples prior to its micelle enhanced spectrofluorimetic determination. In this LDS-DLLME coupled VA-D-SPE method, milk samples were first treated with methanol/water (80:20, v/v) after removing the fat layer. This solvent was directly used as the dispersing solvent in DLLME along with using 1-heptanol (as a low-density solvent with respect to water) as the extracting solvent. In VA-D-SPE approach, hydrophobic oleic acid modified Fe3O4 nanoparticles were used to retrieve the analyte from the DLLME step. It is considerably that the target of VA-D-SPE was 1-heptanol rather than the aflatoxin M1 directly. The main parameters affecting the efficiency of LDS-DLLME and VA-D-SPE procedures and signal enhancement of aflatoxin M1 were investigated and optimized. Under the optimum conditions, the method was linear in the range from 0.02 to 200µgL⁻¹ with the correlation coefficient (R²) of 0.9989 and detection limit of 13ngL⁻¹. The intra-day precision was 2.9 and 4.3% and the inter-day precision was 2.1 and 3.3% for concentration of 2 and 50µgL⁻¹ respectively. The developed method was applied for extraction and preconcentration of AFM1 in three commercially available milk samples and the results were compared with the official AOAC method.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaflatoxin M1 3acorrelation 3afluorescence emission spectroscopy 3ahydrophobicity 3airon oxides 3aliquid-phase microextraction 3amagnetism 3amethanol 3amicelles 3amilk 3ananoparticles 3aoleic acid 3asolid phase extraction 3asolvents 0aAflatoxin M1 0aDispersive liquid–liquid microextraction 0aVortex-assisted dispersive-solid phase extraction 0aHydrophobic magnetic nanoparticles 0aSurfactant enhanced spectrofluorimetry1 aTaherimaslak, Zohreh1 aAllahyari, Mehdi1 aPourghazi, Kamyar1 aManafi, Mohammad Hanif0 tTalanta.g2015 Mar. 01, v. 134 p.98-104dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11742x0039-91407nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.talanta.2014.11.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03464naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001800139245004600157300001800203500002000221520199300241592002802234650001602262650002002278650001402298650001902312650001602331650001102347650002002358650001402378650001602392650001302408650002202421650001502443650001402458650002102472650001602493650001202509651001402521651002302535700002302558700002302581700002302604700002102627700002402648700001802672700001902690700002502709773010602734856007302840852000902913655001202922IND60576985720221120124150.0170806e201709  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057698572DNAL7 a10.1111/gcb.137072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOsborne, Kate10aDelayed coral recovery in a warming ocean  ap. 3869-3881.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aClimate change threatens coral reefs across the world. Intense bleaching has caused dramatic coral mortality in many tropical regions in recent decades, but less obvious chronic effects of temperature and other stressors can be equally threatening to the long‐term persistence of diverse coral‐dominated reef systems. Coral reefs persist if coral recovery rates equal or exceed average rates of mortality. While mortality from acute destructive events is often obvious and easy to measure, estimating recovery rates and investigating the factors that influence them requires long‐term commitment. Coastal development is increasing in many regions, and sea surface temperatures are also rising. The resulting chronic stresses have predictable, adverse effects on coral recovery, but the lack of consistent long‐term data sets has prevented measurement of how much coral recovery rates are actually changing. Using long‐term monitoring data from 47 reefs spread over 10 degrees of latitude on Australia's Great Barrier Reef (GBR), we used a modified Gompertz equation to estimate coral recovery rates following disturbance. We compared coral recovery rates in two periods: 7 years before and 7 years after an acute and widespread heat stress event on the GBR in 2002. From 2003 to 2009, there were few acute disturbances in the region, allowing us to attribute the observed shortfall in coral recovery rates to residual effects of acute heat stress plus other chronic stressors. Compared with the period before 2002, the recovery of fast‐growing Acroporidae and of “Other” slower growing hard corals slowed after 2002, doubling the time taken for modest levels of recovery. If this persists, recovery times will be increasing at a time when acute disturbances are predicted to become more frequent and intense. Our study supports the need for management actions to protect reefs from locally generated stresses, as well as urgent global action to mitigate climate change.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAcroporidae 3aadverse effects 3ableaching 3aclimate change 3acoral reefs 3acorals 3adata collection 3aequations 3aheat stress 3alatitude 3along term effects 3amonitoring 3amortality 3aresidual effects 3atemperature 3atropics 3aAustralia 3aGreat Barrier Reef1 aThompson, Angus A.1 aCheal, Alistair J.1 aEmslie, Michael J.1 aJohns, Kerryn A.1 aJonker, Michelle J.1 aLogan, Murray1 aMiller, Ian R.1 aSweatman, Hugh P.

Except for ADL (P = 0.06) highly significant (P < 0.0001) differences were observed for all traits. The observed cultivar-depend variations were substantial with GY varying by 1.8-fold and SY by 2.3-fold and HI by 1.6-fold. Important straw fodder quality traits such straw N varied by 1.5-fold and the cultivar with the highest IVOMD differed from the poorest one by 6.1 percentage points. With the exceptions of N and ADL, year had a significant effect on traits. Broad sense heritability (H2) for SY and IVOMD were substantial (>0.73) and intermediate (>0.49) for GY, NDF, ADF and ME and poor (<0.17) for Silica, N and ADL.Possible trade-offs between traits were investigated. GY and SY were unrelated (P = 0.52). Nitrogen content of rice straw tended (P = 0.08) to be inversely related with GY but not with SY (P = 0.89). NDF content was unrelated to GY (P = 0.52) but was significantly (P = 0.01) positively correlated with SY. The reverse was observed for ADF, which was significantly (P = 0.02) positively correlated with GY but unrelated to SY (P = 0.48). ADL was not correlated (P = 0.79) with GY but was positively associated (P = 0.01) with SY. Silica content was also unrelated (P = 0.17) to GY but was inversely (P = 0.03) associated with SY. IVOMD and GY were inversely associated (P = 0.07) as was ME and GY (P = 0.09. IVOMD tended (P = 0.1) to also inversely related to SY but ME and SY were not related (P = 0.24). To summarize, considerable cultivars-dependent variations in food and fodder traits exist among released cultivars, though key positive straw quality traits could inversely (P < 0.10) associated with GY. Straw storage influenced straw quality, though an unexpected one since quality tended to improve. Key straw quality traits at harvest and after storage were still significantly correlated but the correlation coefficients could fall substantially below 1.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOryza sativa 3aacid insoluble lignin 3acultivars 3adetergents 3adigestibility 3agrain yield 3aharvest index 3aheritability 3ametabolizable energy 3anitrogen content 3aorganic matter 3arice 3arice straw 3asilica 0aDual purpose rice cultivars 0agrain-straw relationships1 aSubba Rao, I.V1 aJyothi, B1 aŚārada, Pōlaṃrāju,1 aVenkateswarlu, G1 aReddy Ch, R.

Two cultivars of gerbera (red ‘Stanza’ and yellow ‘Double Dutch’) were supplemented with four different NO₃ ⁻:NH₄ ⁺ ratios (100:0, 80:20, 60:40, and 40:60). Replacing 20% nitrate in the nutrient solution with ammonium resulted in the higher number of leaves per plant, highest fresh and dry weights of roots and shoots, greatest number of flowers, highest flower stalk diameter and flower disk diameter, longest vase life, highest fresh and dry weight of inflorescences, and highest relative water contents in petals compared with the control. Decreasing the NO₃ ⁻:NH₄ ⁺ ratio to 60:40 caused a considerable reduction in plant growth and biomass. The chlorophyll and carotenoid contents, as well as catalase (CAT) and peroxidase (POX) activity, increased with increasing proportion of ammonium-to-nitrate in the nutrient solution. The results suggest that a NO₃ ⁻:NH₄ ⁺ ratio of 80:20 should be used for gerbera cut flower production to achieve the highest growth and quality.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGerbera jamesonii 3aammonium 3abiomass 3acarotenoids 3acatalase 3achlorophyll 3acorolla 3acultivars 3acut flowers 3aleaves 3anitrates 3anutrient solutions 3aperoxidase 3aplant growth 3aroots 3ashoots 3asoilless culture 3avase life1 aKiani, Shahram1 aKhoshgoftarmanesh, Amir Hosein1 aAmoaghaie, Reihaneh0 tHorticulture, environment and biotechnology.g2017 Aug., v. 58, no. 4 p.313-323dKorean Society for Horticultural Sciencex2211-34527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13580-017-0067-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02744naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100001500166245010900181300001600290520106400306592002801370650000801398650001601406650003901422650002001461650001201481650001501493650001201508650000801520650002301528650001401551650002501565650002201590650002701612650003301639650002301672650003001695650002701725650002201752650002301774653002901797653003001826653002501856653002001881653002001901700001701921700001501938700001901953700001601972773010001988856008102088852000902169655001202178IND60113428920221119125816.0161024e20130820xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011342892DNAL7 a239692502pmid7 a10.1016/j.jgg.2013.05.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFu, Shulan10aAlteration of Terminal Heterochromatin and Chromosome Rearrangements in Derivatives of Wheat-Rye Hybrids  ap. 413-420.  aWheat-rye addition and substitution lines and their self progenies revealed variations in telomeric heterochromatin and centromeres.

An unstable multicentric chromosome was found in the progeny of a 6R/6D substitution line. Drastic variation of terminal heterochromatin including movement and disappearance of terminal heterochromatin occurred in the progeny of wheat-rye addition line 3R, and the 5RS ditelosomic addition line. Highly stable minichromosomes were observed in the progeny of a monosomic 4R addition line, a ditelosomic 5RS addition line and a 6R/6D substitution line. Minichromosomes, with and without the FISH signals for telomeric DNA (TTTAGGG)n, derived from a monosomic 4R addition line are stable and transmissible to the next generation.

If diverse species mixtures contain species with phenological differences in growth and reproduction, this could enhance ecosystem functioning by increasing the duration over which a valuable process operates. Phenological complementarity describes a species mixture where plant growth or reproduction is more evenly spread over time among species than predicted by chance. Here we report general phenological patterns of growth and reproduction from the third year of a four-year modular green roof experiment involving 13 species from five life form groups, planted in mixtures and monocultures. The relationships between phenological complementarity in canopy density (a surrogate for aboveground biomass) in species mixtures and thermal and hydrological functions were determined for the fourth year of the study.Timing of peak growth occurred from May to July, differing greatly among species. Flowering times also differed among species and occurred from May to October. Six species showed variation in phenology depending on whether they were planted in monocultures or species mixtures, suggesting competitive or facilitative interactions with other species. Phenological complementarity in canopy density was observed in four of the species mixture treatments, with mixtures of species from the same life form tending to have the highest complementarity values. Phenological complementarity was weakly negatively correlated with the temporal coefficient of variation in stormwater capture, indicating the potential for greater process stability over time in complementary mixtures.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaboveground biomass 3aaesthetics 3acanopy 3acorrelation 3aecosystem services 3aecosystems 3aflowering 3agreen roofs 3aphenology 3aplant growth 3aplanting 3areproduction 3astormwater 0aEcosystem services 0aPhenology 0aFlowering 0aGrowth rate 0aBiodiversity 0aPlant community1 aLundholm, Jeremy0 tEcological engineering.g2016 Sept., v. 94 p.82-87dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11630x0925-85747nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoleng.2016.05.0183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02798naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002300152245011600175300001600291520166700307592002801974650001502002650001502017650001102032650002102043650001502064650002102079650003402100650001702134700001502151700001902166700001902185773011402204856008602318990002302404852000902427655001202436IND60113193820221121165348.0141111e20111101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011319382DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jelechem.2011.07.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRöefzaad, Melanie10aPotential dependent structure transitions of heptyl viologen layers on Cu(100) studied by in situ STM and IRRAS  ap. 219-228.  aThe redox behavior and potential dependent adsorption structure of heptyl viologen (1,1′-Diheptyl-4,4′-bipyridinium dichloride, DHV²⁺) on a Cu(100) electrode have been investigated by Cyclic Voltammetry (CV), in situ Electrochemical Scanning Tunneling Microscopy (EC-STM) and Infrared Reflection Absorption Spectroscopy (IRRAS). Current peaks in CV measurements of the redox-active DHV molecule are ascribed to two one-electron transfer steps and phase transformation processes. A highly ordered 2D dot-array structure emerges on the c(2×2)-Cl modified Cu(100) electrode surface between +200 and −100mV in STM images. One-electron reduction of the dications DHV²⁺ around −150mV causes a phase transition from a dot to a stripe pattern which has a bi-layer structure in the STM images. With a further decrease of the applied potential, the structure of the adlayer undergoes a further change from the bi-layer phase to a close-packed monolayer of stripes. An IRRAS analysis on the orientation of the bipyridine moieties reveals a slight tilt of the long molecular axis with respect to the surface in the dicationic phase, but a parallel orientation in the monocationic striped phases. Additionally a large fraction of the hydrocarbon chains are in gauche conformation with low order among them. Only in the bi-layer stripe phase evidence for a marginal order between the alkyl chains was found. Calculation of the average angle of the alkyl chains with respect to the surface normal reveals an orientation along the surface within the dot structure but an outward tilt within the closed packed monolayer due to space limitation between the stripes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3aadsorption 3acopper 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrodes 3aphase transition 3ascanning tunneling microscopy 3aspectroscopy1 aJiang, Min1 aZamlynny, Vlad1 aWandelt, Klaus0 tJournal of electroanalytical chemistry.g2011 Nov. 1, v. 662, no. 1 p.219-228dElsevier B.V.x1572-66577nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jelechem.2011.07.0063Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03346naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002500151245019100176300001600367520177000383592002802153650001502181650001502196650001202211650003502223650001602258650000902274650001402283650001502297650001402312650001402326650001302340650001602353653002202369653001802391653001202409653003302421653002502454700006702479700002302546700003002569700002602599700001902625700002202644773009202666856008502758852000902843655001202852IND60603233420221119201249.0180713e20150301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060323342DNAL7 a10.1016/j.talanta.2014.11.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZmozinski, Ariane V.10aDirect solid sample analysis with graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrometry—A fast and reliable screening procedure for the determination of inorganic arsenic in fish and seafood  ap. 224-231.  aDirect solid sample analysis with graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrometry (SS-GF AAS) was investigated initially with the intention of developing a method for the determination of total As in fish and other seafood. A mixture of 0.1% Pd+0.06% Mg+0.06% Triton X-100 was used as the chemical modifier, added in solution over the solid samples, making possible the use of pyrolysis and atomization temperatures of 1200°C and 2400°C, respectively. The sample mass had to be limited to 0.25mg, as the integrated absorbance did not increase further with increasing sample mass. Nevertheless, the recovery of As from several certified reference materials was of the order of 50% lower than the certified value. Strong molecular absorption due to the phosphorus monoxide molecule (PO) was observed with high-resolution continuum source AAS (HR CS AAS), which, however, did not cause any spectral interference. A microwave-assisted digestion with HNO3/H2O2 was also investigated to solve the problem; however, the results obtained for several certified reference materials were statistically not different from those found with direct SS-GF AAS. Accurate values were obtained using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) to analyze the digested samples, which suggested that organic As compounds are responsible for the low recoveries. HPLC–ICP-MS was used to determine the arsenobetaine (AB) concentration. Accurate results that were not different from the certified values were obtained when the AB concentration was added to the As concentration found by SS-GF AAS for most certified reference materials (CRM) and samples, suggesting that SS-GF AAS could be used as a fast screening procedure for inorganic As determination in fish and seafood.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorbance 3aabsorption 3aarsenic 3aatomic absorption spectrometry 3aatomization 3afish 3aoctoxynol 3aphosphorus 3apyrolysis 3ascreening 3aseafoods 3atemperature 0aInorganic arsenic 0aArsenobetaine 0aSeafood 0aDirect solid sample analysis 0aGraphite furnace AAS1 aLlorente-Mirandes, Toni1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4335-424X1 aDamin, Isabel C.F.1 aLópez-Sánchez, José F.1 aVale, Maria Goreti R.1 aWelz, Bernhard1 aSilva, Márcia M.0 tTalanta.g2015 Mar. 01, v. 134 p.224-231dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11742x0039-91407nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.talanta.2014.11.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01257naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002100139245014000160300001400300500002000314520010800334592002800442650002900470650000900499650001300508650001500521650001500536700001700551700001900568700001900587700002600606700002500632700002300657700001900680773010200699856007300801852000900874655001200883IND60576985920221120124105.0170806e201709  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057698592DNAL7 a10.1111/gcb.137582doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMusolff, Andreas10aDoes iron reduction control the release of dissolved organic carbon and phosphate at catchment scales?

We conducted a series of experiments and observations with the aim of determining the dispersal mode of the African root and tuber scale Stictococcus vayssierei, a pest on cassava in the Congo Basin. We monitored the main options of dispersal that occurred in scale insects: wandering of first-instar nymphs (crawlers), active dispersal by ant workers, phoresis on colony-founding queen ants, and passive dispersal by wind. Results showed that A. tenella workers are actively involved in the transport and dissemination of scale crawlers. When ants were excluded, crawlers could move by themselves for a short distance to find the host plant. In the presence of ants, crawlers were transported by ant workers for longer distance across the bridge and established on scale-free plants. Scales transport increased with the duration of the experiment and ant density. Neither a case of phoresis nor dispersal by wind was recorded, suggesting that passive dispersal is rare. These results outline the active role of A. tenella workers in the dispersal of immature stages of S. vayssierei in Southern Cameroon and have implication in the management of the scale on cassava.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAnoplolepis 3aHemiptera 3abasins 3acassava 3ahost plants 3aimmatures 3ainsect behavior 3anymphs 3ascale insects 3awind 3aCameroon 3aRepublic of the Congo1 aHanna, Rachid1 aTindo, Maurice1 aNagel, Peter0 tJournal of insect behavior.g2015 July, v. 28, no. 4 p.426-435dSpringer USx0892-75537nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10905-015-9513-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02528naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002900151245014600180300001600326520107500342592002801417650001501445650001501460650000901475650003401484650001301518650000901531650001301540650001401553650002001567650002401587650001101611650002001622653001301642653003301655653002301688653003401711653003801745700002501783700002101808700002301829700002001852773009201872856008501964852000902049655001202058IND60603233520221119201234.0180713e20150301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060323352DNAL7 a10.1016/j.talanta.2014.11.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIvandini, Tribidasari A.10aAnodic stripping voltammetry of gold nanoparticles at boron-doped diamond electrodes and its application in immunochromatographic strip tests  ap. 136-143.  aAnodic stripping voltammetry (ASV) of colloidal gold-nanoparticles (AuNPs) was investigated at boron-doped diamond (BDD) electrodes in 50mM HClO4. A deposition time of 300s at−0.2V (vs. Ag/AgCl) was fixed as the condition for the ASV. The voltammograms showed oxidation peaks that could be attributed to the oxidation of gold. These oxidation peaks were then investigated for potential application in immunochromatographic strip tests for the selective and quantitative detection of melamine, in which AuNPs were used as the label for the antibody of melamine. Linear regression of the oxidation peak currents appeared in the concentration range from 0.05–0.6μg/mL melamine standard, with an estimated LOD of 0.069μg/mL and an average relative standard deviation of 8.0%. This indicated that the method could be considered as an alternative method for selective and quantitative immunochromatographic applications. The validity was examined by the measurements of melamine injected into milk samples, which showed good recovery percentages during the measurements.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantibodies 3aelectrodes 3agold 3aimmunoaffinity chromatography 3amelamine 3amilk 3ananogold 3aoxidation 3aperchloric acid 3aregression analysis 3asilver 3asilver chloride 0aMelamine 0aAnodic stripping voltammetry 0aGold nanoparticles 0aBoron-doped diamond electrode 0aImmunochromatographic strip tests1 aWicaksono, Wiyogo P.1 aSaepudin, Endang1 aRismetov, Bakhadir1 aEinaga, Yasuaki0 tTalanta.g2015 Mar. 01, v. 134 p.136-143dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11742x0039-91407nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.talanta.2014.11.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03210naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002600151245018100177300001600358520163100374592002802005650002502033650001402058650001402072650001302086650001502099650002002114650004302134650002102177650002502198650001502223650001002238650002302248650003202271650001302303650002002316653003402336653003202370653002002402653001602422653001502438700002302453700002502476700002902501773009202530856008502622852000902707655001202716IND60603233620221119201219.0180713e20150301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060323362DNAL7 a10.1016/j.talanta.2014.11.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMoein, Mohammad Mahdi10aMolecularly imprinted sol-gel nanofibers based solid phase microextraction coupled on-line with high performance liquid chromatography for selective determination of acesulfame  ap. 340-347.  aSol-gel based molecularly imprinted polymer (MIP) nanofiber was successfully fabricated by electrospinning technique on the surface of a stainless steel bar. The manufactured tool was applied for on-line selective solid phase microextraction (SPME) and determination of acesulfame (ACF) as an artificial sweetener with high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The selective ability of method for the extraction of ACF was investigated in the presence of some selected sweeteners such as saccharine (SCH), aspartame (ASP) and caffeine (CAF). Electrospinning of MIP sol-gel solution on the stainless steel bar provided an unbreakable sorbent with high thermal, mechanical, and chemical stability. Moreover, application of the MIP-SPME tool revealed a unique approach for the selective microextraction of the analyte in beverage samples. In this work, 3-(triethoxysilyl)-propylamine (TMSPA) was chosen as a precursor due to its ability to imprint the analyte by hydrogen bonding, Van der Walls, and dipole-dipole interactions. Nylon 6 was also added as a backbone and support for the precursor in which sol could greatly growth during the sol-gel process and makes the solution electrospinable. Various effective parameters in the extraction efficiency of the MIP-SPME tool such as loading time, flow rate, desorption time, selectivity, and the sample volume were evaluated. The linearity for the ACF in beverage sample was in the range of 0.78–100.5ng mL⁻¹. Limit of detection (LOD) and quantification (LOQ) were 0.23 and 0.78ng mL⁻¹ respectively. The RSD values (n=5) were all below 3.5%at the 20ng mL⁻¹ level.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacesulfame potassium 3aaspartame 3abeverages 3acaffeine 3adesorption 3adetection limit 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3ahydrogen bonding 3amolecular imprinting 3ananofibers 3anylon 3asol-gel processing 3asolid phase microextraction 3asorbents 3astainless steel 0aMolecularly imprinted sol-gel 0aSolid phase microextraction 0aElectrospinning 0aUnbreakable 0aAcesulfame1 aJavanbakht, Mehran1 aKarīmī, Maḥmūd,1 aAkbari-adergani, Behrouz0 tTalanta.g2015 Mar. 01, v. 134 p.340-347dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11742x0039-91407nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.talanta.2014.11.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03393naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001400147245011000161300001600271520160900287592002801896650002101924650001401945650002501959650001901984650003502003650001002038650002502048650003002073650001502103650001302118650001902131650002102150650000902171650004302180650001702223650001702240653003702257653002102294653001702315653001402332653002102346653001102367700001802378700002702396700001902423700002702442700001702469700001902486700001802505700001302523700001502536700005102551773009802602856008202700852000902782655001202791IND60634546120221119075646.0211129e20190315xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063454612DNAL7 a10.1016/j.lfs.2019.02.0412doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhou, Jie10aMicroRNA-145 overexpression attenuates apoptosis and increases matrix synthesis in nucleus pulposus cells  ap. 274-283.  aLower back pain is often associated with intervertebral disc degeneration (IDD), which results from a decrease in nucleus pulposus (NP) cells and an imbalance between the degradation and synthesis of extracellular matrix (ECM) components. Multiple microRNAs play crucial roles in the modulation of NP cell apoptosis and matrix degradation. miR-145 is an important microRNA related to degenerative diseases such as osteoarthritis. Here, the effect of miR-145 in IDD was elucidated. The aim of this study was to explore the role and mechanism of miR-145 in the apoptosis of NP cells and in matrix metabolism in NP cells.Real-time PCR, western blotting and flow cytometry analysis were used to observe the effect of miR-145 on NP cell apoptosis in the absence or presence of oxidative stress. Cell transfection, loss-of-function experiments using an ADAM17 inhibitor or lentiviral shADAM17, immunofluorescence, real-time PCR and western blotting were performed to demonstrate the role and mechanism of miR-145 in NP cell matrix metabolism.miR-145 attenuated NP cell apoptosis in the absence and presence of oxidative stress. Moreover, miR-145 overexpression increased and miR-145 suppression decreased matrix synthesis. ADAM17, which is expressed in degenerative discs, is the target of miR-145. ADAM17 gene suppression with lentiviral shRNA or an inhibitor enhanced matrix synthesis in NP cells. In addition, siADAM17 reversed the matrix degradation induced by miR-145 inhibition.miR-145 suppresses apoptosis and promotes ECM synthesis in NP cells. miR-145 is thus a potential therapeutic microRNA for IDD.  aPublisher supplied data 3aWestern blotting 3aapoptosis 3aextracellular matrix 3aflow cytometry 3afluorescent antibody technique 3agenes 3aintervertebral disks 3aloss-of-function mutation 3ametabolism 3amicroRNA 3aosteoarthritis 3aoxidative stress 3apain 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3atherapeutics 3atransfection 0aIntervertebral disc degeneration 0aNucleus pulposus 0amicroRNA-145 0aApoptosis 0aOxidative stress 0aADAM171 aSun, Jianchao1 aMarkova, Dessislava Z.1 aLi, Shuangxing1 aKepler, Christopher K.1 aHong, Junmin1 aHuang, Yingjie1 aChen, Weijian1 aXu, Kang1 aWei, Fuxin1 aYe, Wei1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2908-13050 tLife sciences.g2019 Mar. 15, v. 221 p.274-283dElsevier Inc.wJournal:11720x0024-32057nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lfs.2019.02.0413Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03207naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002300152245009200175300001800267520212200285592002802407650000802435650002202443650001502465650001402480650002202494650001002516650000902526650001102535650001702546650001302563650002902576650001202605700003202617773008902649856008602738852000902824655001202833IND60084869320221121013531.0141101e201111  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008486932DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apenergy.2011.03.0482doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKhalil, Ahmed E.E.10aSwirling distributed combustion for clean energy conversion in gas turbine applications  ap. 3685-3693.  aDistributed combustion provides significant performance improvement of gas turbine combustors. Key features of distributed combustion includes uniform thermal field in the entire combustion chamber, thus avoiding hot-spot regions that promote NOₓ emissions (from thermal NOₓ) and significantly improved pattern factor. Rapid mixing between the injected fuel and hot oxidizer has been carefully explored for spontaneous ignition of the mixture to achieve distributed combustion reactions. Distributed reactions can be achieved in premixed, partially premixed or non-premixed modes of combustor operation with sufficient entrainment of hot and active species present in the flame and their rapid turbulent mixing with the reactants. Distributed combustion with swirl is investigated here for our quest to explore the beneficial aspects of such flows on clean combustion in simulated gas turbine combustion conditions. The goal is to develop high intensity combustor with ultra low emissions of NO and CO, and much improved pattern factor. Experimental results are reported from a cylindrical geometry combustor with different modes of fuel injection and gas exit stream location in the combustor. In all the configurations, air was injected tangentially to impart swirl to the flow inside the combustor. Ultra-low NOₓ emissions were found for both the premixed and non-premixed combustion modes for the geometries investigated here. Swirling flow configuration, wherein the product gas exits axially resulted in characteristics closest to premixed combustion mode. Change in fuel injection location resulted in changing the combustion characteristics from traditional diffusion mode to distributed combustion regime.

S.10aSabotaging Behavior and Decision-Making in Larvae of the Queen Butterfly Danaus gilippus  ap. 460-472.  aSabotaging behavior and decision-making during ontogeny in herbivorous insects remain largely underappreciated. Insects that use hosts bearing articulated laticifers would be expected to cut trenches to deactivate this plant defense. Contrary to this expectation, larvae of Danaus erippus display vein cutting when feeding on Asclepias curassavica, a host with articulated anastomosing laticifers; the frequency of sabotaging varies according to ontogeny. Scant records indicate that larvae of the congener Danaus gilippus perform both trenching and vein-cutting on milkweeds. In view of this incongruency, we examined the sabotaging behavior of D. gilippus on A. curassavica during larval ontogeny. Continuous observations of D. gilippus on A. curassavica revealed that the larvae always sabotaged leaves before feeding. Leaves were selected by larvae of D. gilippus for size but not age. Early instars cut trenches on large leaves, and the frequency of trenching decreased as the larvae grew. Vein cutting became predominant in late instars, and petiole cutting was observed in all last instars. Because sabotaging behavior was ubiquitous, artificial trenches and cuts were made on intact leaves to examine if leaf severance affects sabotaging frequency; sabotaging decreased significantly in artificially damaged leaves. Although sabotaging behavior has a strong innate component in D. gilippus, information regarding leaf dimension and severance is important in the decision-making processes for sabotaging to take place. As D. gilippus differs from D. erippus with respect to sabotaging type and frequency when feeding on the same host, other factors than plant anatomy probably play a role in mediating sabotaging behavior in this butterfly group.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAsclepias curassavica 3aDanaus 3abutterflies 3adecision making 3ahosts 3ainsect behavior 3ainstars 3alarvae 3aontogeny 3apetioles 3aphytophagous insects 3atrenching1 aRodrigues, Daniela0 tJournal of insect behavior.g2015 July, v. 28, no. 4 p.460-472dSpringer USx0892-75537nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10905-015-9514-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02011naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002500143245006100168300001600229520092400245592002801169650001201197650002501209650002601234650002601260650001201286650001501298650001801313650000901331653002401340653001601364653001301380700002201393700002001415773011501435856007801550852000901628655001201637IND60708622920221122023110.0200904e20200901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070862292DNAL7 a10.2478/ata-2020-00222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKažimírová, Viera10aEvaluation of Properties of Pellets Made of Swine Manure  ap. 137-143.  aThis paper deals with assessment of density, moisture content and mechanical properties of pellets made of dry swine manure utilizing pellet production line MGL 200.

In this study, the contribution of the two substances to methanogenesis and the conversion in Zoige wetland were analyzed. It was determined that methanol supported the highest CH₄ formation rate in the enrichments of the soil grown with Eleocharis valleculosa, and even higher at 15°C than at 30°C; while hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis was higher at 30°C. Both methanol- and acetate-using methanogens were counted at the highest (10⁷ g⁻¹) in the soil, whereas methanol-using acetogens (10⁸ g⁻¹) were ten times more abundant than either methanol- or acetate-using methanogens. Both methanol and acetate were detected in the methanogenesis-inhibited soil samples, so that both could be the primary methanogenic precursors in E. valleculosa soil. However, the levels of methanol and acetate accumulated in 2-bromoethane-sulfonate (BES)- and CHCl₃-treated soils were in reverse, i.e., higher methanol in CHCl₃- and higher acetate in BES-treated soil, so that methanol-derived methanogenesis could be underestimated due to the consumption by acetogens. Analysis of the soil 16S rRNA genes revealed Acetobacterum bakii and Trichococcus pasteurii to be the dominant methanol-using acetogens in the soil, and a strain of T. pasteurii was isolated, which showed the high conversion of methanol to acetate at 15°C. 3aAcetobacterium bakii 3aEleocharis 3aTrichococcus 3aacetates 3acold 3agenes 3amethane production 3amethanogens 3amethanol 3aplateaus 3aribosomal RNA 3asoil 3asoil sampling 3awetlands 2aAcetatesxmetabolism 2aAcetobacteriumxgeneticsxisolation & purificationxmetabolism. 2aCold Temperature 2aDNA, Bacterialxgenetics 2aEleocharisxgrowth & development 2aLactobacillalesxgeneticsxisolation & purificationxmetabolism. 2aMethanexmetabolism 2aMethanolxmetabolism 2aPhylogeny 2aRNA, Ribosomal, 16Sxgenetics 2aSoilxanalysis. 2aSoil Microbiology 2aWetlands 0aChina1 aWang, Yanfen1 aDong, Xiuzhu0 tMicrobial ecology.g2010 July, v. 60, no. 1 p.206-213dSpringer-Verlagx0095-36287nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00248-009-9602-0 7aarticle01586naa a2200301 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100002100115245005100136300001400187500001500201520070700216650002000923650002000943650002500963650002400988653002201012653001401034700001701048773014401065852000901209939003301218945000801251946001301259655001201272991614831160742620221120195427.0831019e198212  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aAGE839222212DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMcClelland, J.W.10aTeaching consumer economics using taste panels  ap. 91-96.  a2019-12-04  aExtract: The use of alternative teaching techniques has been widely discussed in the economics education literature. This paper discusses the theoretical justification for using alternative teaching techniques via the production function concept of economics education. The use of the consumer taste panel is introduced as an alternative method for teaching some of the basic assumptions of perfect competition and indifference curve analysis. More specifically, the taste panel is used to illustrate consistency and transitivity in consumer preferences and the effects of advertising on consumer choice. Empirical results of a taste panel application to an economics class are presented and evaluated. 3aeconomic theory 3aconsumer demand 3aconsumer preferences 3aeducational methods 0aconsumer behavior 0aeducation1 aBroder, J.M.0 tSouthern journal of agricultural economics - Southern Agricultural Economics Association.g1982 Dec., v. 14, no. 2 p.91-96x0081-30527nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19831019c00000000  aAGE  aOther US 7aarticle03281naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127072000900145072000900154100001700163245012400180300001800304500002400322500001500346520165000361650001402011650001502025650001502040650001202055650001402067650001602081650001502097650002002112650001402132650002202146650001602168650002802184650002202212650001402234650002702248650001802275653002002293653001802313653002302331653001302354700001702367700001302384700001602397700001902413773012402432852000902556856006902565930003302634945002502667946001102692655001202703IND4384958320221120192512.0061105e200611  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438495832DNAL7 a10.1007/s10722-005-6844-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF200 0aF6001 aSuso, M.

Inter and intra-plot gene flow and pollen dispersion between small plots in a field of Vicia faba germplasm multiplication were measured under four isolation zones at two locations. The four isolation zones were: a barren zone, a nucleocytoplasmic Vicia faba male sterile line, a Vicia faba tetraploid genotype and a Vicia narbonensis L. population. Genotypes fixed for alternative isozyme and allozyme alleles allowed the identification of inter and intra-plot hybrids through progeny testing. A set of log-likelihood ratio (LLR) G tests were used to analyze the effects of geographical location, isolation zone and genotype on the different components of gene flow. Considerable heterogeneity among the genotypes in all the components, inter and intra-plot gene flow and pollen dispersion, of gene flow has been found. It has been shown that gene flow is location, isolation zone and genotype dependent. Planting a barrier surrounding the plots rather than using a non cultivated area between plots seemed more or less efficient for preventing inter-plot gene flow depending on the genotype and the location. Specific associations between genotype and male sterile or tetraploid border rows for every location can bring about gene flow as high, or even higher, than those produced by a barren zone. Differences among the genotypes and borders in flowering overlapping appear not to be the major factor influencing the pattern of gene flow. Implications of the pattern of gene flow observed are discussed in relation to crop diversity managed by farmers. 3agermplasm 3aVicia faba 3aandroecium 3aalleles 3aflowering 3apollen flow 3afaba beans 3aplant fertility 3agene flow 3aVicia narbonensis 3atetraploidy 3aplant genetic resources 3agenetic variation 3aallozymes 3agermplasm conservation 3aintrogression 0agenetic erosion 0ahybridization 0aplant reproduction 0aisozymes1 aGilsanz, S. 1 aDuc, G. 1 aMarget, P. 1 aMoreno, M.

Although antigen-driven B-cell maturation and isotype switching occur within germinal centres (GCs), the role of GCs in IgE production is poorly understood. In view of this, we investigated the development of IgE-expressing cells within GCs in response to an extensively characterized antigen, 2-phenyloxazolone (phOx). The phOx-specific IgE-expressing cells localized within GCs 7 days after immunization, and peaked in number on day 11. Surprisingly, very few IgE-positive cells were found in the T-cell areas of the lymph node. Flow cytometric studies confirmed that IgE was expressed by B cells and was not the result of trapping by follicular dendritic cells. The specificity of the antibody response was confirmed by microdissection and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction using phOx-specific IgE primers. IgE-positive cells were primarily found within GCs while, in contrast, many IgG1-positive cells could also be detected outside GCs in the T-cell areas. Taken together, these data highlight the importance of GCs in the production of antigen-specific IgE antibody. 3aimmunoglobulin E 0aB cells 0agerminal centre 0aisotypes/isotype switching 0amicroenvironment1 aButch, Anthony W.0 tImmunology.g2007 Mar., v. 120, no. 3 p.345-353dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0019-28057nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2567.2006.02509.x3electronic resource  a20070213b20070303c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle01616naa a2200301 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100001700115245005000132300001400182520076200196650001300958650001100971650001800982650001901000650001901019650002001038650002501058653001201083773014401095852000901239930003301248945000801281946001301289655001201302991614830370742620221120192402.0831018e198307  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aAGE839221962DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRuttan, V.W.10aMoral responsibility in agricultural research  ap. 73-80.  aExtract: During the 1970's serious questions arose about the significance of scientific progress and technical change for human progress. Research to develop the mechanical tomato harvester and on tobacco improvement are cited as cases which pose serious moral dilemnas for the research community. It is argued that society has a right to hold scientists, engineers, and agronomists responsible for the consequence of technical and institutional change set in motion by their research. A wise society will let the burden of responsibility rest lightly. But society should also insist that agricultural research community embrace a research community embrace a research agenda that includes the ecolgical and institutional impacts of agricultural technology. 3aresearch 3aethics 3asocial impact 3asocial welfare 3apublic opinion 3aquality of life 3atechnological change 0aScience0 tSouthern journal of agricultural economics - Southern Agricultural Economics Association.g1983 July, v. 15, no. 1 p.73-80x0081-30527nnas  aDNAL  a20060720b20060804c00000000  aAGE  aOther US 7aarticle03101naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127072000900145100002400154245013300178300001800311500002400329500001500353520142100368650003001789650001401819650002101833650002701854650001401881650003601895650002101931650001601952650002201968650001901990650002502009650002002034651001202054653002802066653002702094653002402121700001802145700002402163700001402187700001902201700001702220700001802237700002102255773012402276852000902400856006902409930003302478945002502511946001102536655001202547IND4384957720221120192529.0061105e200611  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438495772DNAL7 a10.1007/s10722-005-5033-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF2001 aCouvreur, T.

The genetic relationships between the crop and its wild relatives are still unclear. We undertook field and laboratory work in order to describe differentiation and relationships between the wild and cultivated populations of the species in Western Ecuador, and their possible interactions. A volumetric study was undertaken on the fruits of both populations, as well as a population genetic analysis in order to clarify these relationships. Fruits from cultivated plants collected in the region of sympatry of wild and cultivated plants in North-West Ecuador showed intermediate volumes between those of reference samples for the wild and cultivated plants in allopatry. Using 8 microsatellite loci, we assessed 83 wild and cultivated individuals from Western Ecuador and cultivated plants from Amazonia and Central America as a reference for the cultivated form. We detected high polymorphism in the wild and cultivated samples and low, but significant level of genetic differentiation between wild and cultivated populations. The cultivated population in North-Western Ecuador showed close genetic proximity with the sympatric wild population, consistent with the volumetric study. These results have implications for hypotheses on evolution of this crop and for strategies of genetic conservation of the wild forms. 3ageographical distribution 3acultivars 3aBactris gasipaes 3amicrosatellite repeats 3aevolution 3atropical and subtropical fruits 3agenetic distance 3afruit crops 3agenetic variation 3awild relatives 3agenetic polymorphism 3agenetic markers 3aEcuador 0amolecular sequence data 0afruits (plant anatomy) 0apopulation genetics1 aBillotte, N. 1 aRisterucci, A. -M. 1 aLara, C. 1 aVigouroux, Y. 1 aLudeña, B. 1 aPham, J. -L. 1 aPintaud, J. -C. 0 tGenetic resources and crop evolution.g2006 Nov., v. 53, no. 7 p.1361-1373dKluwer Academic Publishersx0925-98647nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10722-005-5033-z3electronic resource  a20070305b20070402c00000000  aINDd2CTe2007/01/16  aNon-US 7aarticle02671naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003100092040001800123100002400141245012100165300001600286500002400302520163200326650001701958650001101975650002401986650000902010650001202019650001202031650000902043700002202052700001702074700002402091700001902115773009702134852000902231856008102240655001202321IND4459648420221120192349.0110705s2011    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445964842DNAL7 a10.2460/ajvr.72.4.4912doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDickomeit, Mark Jan10aTopographic and age-dependent distribution of subchondral bone density in the elbow joints of clinically normal dogs  ap. 491-499.  aIncludes references  aObjective—To investigate topographic and age-dependent adaptation of subchondral bone density in the elbow joints of healthy dogs by means of computed tomographic osteoabsorptiometry (CTOAM). Animals—42 elbow joints of 29 clinically normal dogs of various breeds and ages. Procedures—Subchondral bone densities of the humeral, radial, and ulnar joint surfaces of the elbow relative to a water-hydroxyapatite phantom were assessed by means of CTOAM. Distribution patterns in juvenile, adult, and geriatric dogs (age, < 1 year, 1 to 8 years, and > 8 years, respectively) were determined and compared within and among groups. Results—An area of increased subchondral bone density was detected in the humerus distomedially and cranially on the trochlea and in the olecranon fossa. The ulna had maximum bone densities on the anconeal and medial coronoid processes. Increased bone density was detected in the craniomedial region of the joint surface of the radius. A significant age-dependent increase in subchondral bone density was revealed in elbow joint surfaces of the radius, ulna, and humerus. Mean subchondral bone density of the radius was significantly less than that of the ulna in paired comparisons for all dogs combined and in adult and geriatric, but not juvenile, dog groups. Conclusions and Clinical Relevance—An age-dependent increase in subchondral bone density at the elbow joint was revealed. Maximal relative subchondral bone densities were detected consistently at the medial coronoid process and central aspect of the humeral trochlea, regions that are commonly affected n dogs with elbow dysplasia. 3abone density 3abreeds 3acomputed tomography 3adogs 3aelderly 3ahumerus 3aulna1 aBöttcher, Peter.1 aHecht, Silke1 aLiebich, Hans-Georg1 aMaierl, Johann0 tAmerican journal of veterinary research.g2011 Apr., v. 72, no. 4 p.491-499x0002-96457nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2460/ajvr.72.4.4913Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle01005naa a2200265 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092024002200134024001900156040001800175100002000193245007700213300001400290520012600304653002300430653002300453773010600476852000900582856009200591930003300683946001100716655001200727IND4398979720221120182300.0071216e200801  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439897972DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-2567.2007.02773.x2doi7 aPMC24332892pmcid7 a181546162pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKapp, Judith A.10aSpecial regulatory T-cell review: suppressors regulated but unsuppressed  ap. 28-32.  aThe rise-and-fall and reincarnation of suppressor T cells is reviewed from the perspective of a participant in the field. 0asuppressor T cells 0aregulatory T cells0 tImmunology.g2008 Jan., v. 123, no. 1 p.28-32dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0019-28057nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2567.2007.02773.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20071216b20080102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02731naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092024002200134024001900156040001800175100002000193245014000213300001600353520146600369650001901835650001301854650001401867653001401881653001801895700001701913700002001930700002201950700001801972700002301990700002102013700001702034700001702051773010802068852000902176856009202185930003302277946001102310655001202321IND4397716920221120182213.0071111e200712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439771692DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-2567.2007.02672.x2doi7 aPMC22660312pmcid7 a176454992pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTanabe, Junichi10aInterferon-β reduces the mouse liver fibrosis induced by repeated administration of concanavalin A via the direct and indirect effects  ap. 562-570.  aType I interferons (IFNs), IFN-α and IFN-β, are widely used for treating chronic hepatitis C. Although retrospective studies have suggested that type I IFNs have direct antifibrotic effects, little is known about these mechanisms. The present study was designed to clarify the preventive mechanisms of type I IFNs in the progression of fibrosis for the establishment of a more effective therapy. A murine fibrosis model comprising immunological reactions was induced by the administration of concanavalin A (0·3 mg/body) into mice once a week for 4 weeks. Liver injury and the degree of fibrosis were determined by measuring the serum alanine aminotransferase activities and liver hydroxyproline contents with or without IFN-β pretreatment. IFN-β suppressed the hepatocellular injury and increased the hydroxyproline content induced by repeated concanavalin A injections, but had no effect on established fibrosis. Furthermore, IFN-β reduced the expressions of transforming growth factor-β, basic fibroblast growth factor, collagen type I A2 and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 1 messenger RNAs, which are related to the progression of liver fibrosis. The IFN-β reduced the liver injury and fibrosis induced by immunological reactions. These data suggest that type I IFNs suppress the progression of cirrhosis through inhibition of repeated hepatocellular injury and/or factors that promote the liver fibrosis induced by hepatitis virus infection. 3aconcanavalin A 3afibrosis 3ahepatitis 0acirrhosis 0ainterferon-β1 aIzawa, Akiko1 aTakemi, Natsumi1 aMiyauchi, Yasushi1 aTorii, Yuichi1 aTsuchiyama, Hiromi1 aSuzuki, Tomohiko1 aSone, Saburo1 aAndo, Kazuki0 tImmunology.g2007 Dec., v. 122, no. 4 p.562-570dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0019-28057nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2567.2007.02672.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20071111b20071210c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02731naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001800145245010300163300001600266500002400282520158900306650002001895650002301915650001001938650001201948650001601960650001201976650002401988650002402012650000902036650001702045650001002062650001202072650001102084651001002095700002402105773011002129852000902239856008502248655001202333IND4459647020221120171501.0110705s2011    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445964702DNAL7 a10.1017/S00144797110000562doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAune, Jens B.10aEffect of seed priming and micro-dosing of fertilizer on sorghum and pearl millet in Western Sudan  ap. 419-430.  aIncludes references  aThe effect of seed priming and micro-dosing (the application of small amounts of mineral fertilizers) was studied in sorghum and pearl millet in on-station and on-farm experiments for three seasons under rainfed conditions in the North Kordofan State, western Sudan. Seed priming consists of soaking the seeds for eight hours in water prior to sowing. Seed priming increased sorghum grain yield in the on-station experiments across three seasons from 482 kg ha−1 to 807 kg ha−1. Micro-dosing of 0.3 g, 0.6 g and 0.9 g NPK fertilizer (17-17-17) per pocket increased sorghum grain yield by 50.4, 68.8 and 109.7% respectively compared to the control. Seed priming did not significantly increase pearl millet yield while the micro-doses of 0.3, 0.6 and 0.9 g fertilizer increased millet yield by 31.3, 30.7 and 47% respectively. On-farm seed priming increased sorghum yields by 32.6% while seed priming plus 0.3 g fertilizer increased yields by 69.5%. For millet, the corresponding yields increased by 29.8% and 71% respectively. Fertilizer use efficiency for both crops increased remarkably with seed priming, although this effect was more apparent in sorghum than in millet. In sorghum, seed priming and the application of 0.9 g fertilizer per pocket increased the gross margin from 49.5 to 206.5 US$/ha. For millet, the gross margin increased from 44.9 in the control to 90.0 US$/ha with the combination of seed priming and 0.3 g fertilizer per pocket. These technologies are simple to apply; they offer low financial cost and low risk and are affordable for resource-poor farmers. 3aNPK fertilizers 3aPennisetum glaucum 3acrops 3afarmers 3agrain yield 3amillets 3amineral fertilizers 3aprofits and margins 3arisk 3aseed priming 3aseeds 3asoaking 3asowing 3aSudan1 aOusman, Abdelrahman0 tExperimental agriculture.g2011 July, v. 47, no. 3 p.419-430dCambridge University Pressx0014-47977nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S00144797110000563Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02574naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127072000900145072000900154100001700163245008300180300001800263500002400281520124200305650001301547650000901560650002501569650001701594650002001611650002301631650002801654650002401682650001701706650001401723650001201737700001701749700001801766700001601784700001401800700001901814773012401833852000901957856006901966930003302035945002502068946001102093655001202104IND4384958520221120182256.0061105e200611  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438495852DNAL7 a10.1007/s10722-005-6842-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF821 0aF2001 aButrón, A. 10aSearching for New Sources of Pink Stem Borer Resistance in Maize (Zea mays L.)  ap. 1455-1462.  aIncludes references  aThe pink stem borer (Sesamia nonagrioides Lef.) is the main corn (Zea mays L.) pest in the Mediterranean area. Although, screening for resistance to this pest has been successful, the level of resistance shown by the most resistant varieties is not high. The objectives of the present work were: (i) the evaluation for pink stem borer resistance of the nontested inbred lines, field and popcorn materials, from the collection maintained at the Misión Biológica de Galicia and (ii) the study of the performance, under pink stem borer infestation, of inbreds selected for resistance to pink stem borer in hybrid combination. Forty four inbred lines nontested yet for resistant to pink stem borer along with five inbred lines previously reported as resistant to stem and ear attack, were evaluated in 2002 and 2003. In adjacent experiments, hybrids EP79x W552, EP77x B93, and A661x EP42 were tested along with a resistant hybrid, MEB531-Bt, and a susceptible hybrid, INRA 260.

We have previously shown that Jak3 mediates CCR9 and CXCR4 signalling in response to CCL25 and CXCL12 in BM progenitors and thymocytes. The lack of peripheral lymph nodes and Peyer's patches observed in Jak3⁻/⁻ mice suggested a possible role of Jak3 in CCR7-mediated homing to these organs. Here, we demonstrate phosphorylation of Jak3 in peripheral lymphocytes in response CCL19 and CCL21. In addition, Jak3⁻/⁻ naïve T cells and pharmacologically inhibited Jak3⁺/⁺ T lymphocytes have impaired chemotactic responses towards these ligands. Interestingly, CCR7 expression was higher in Jak3⁻/⁻ thymocytes compared to their Jak3⁺/⁻ littermates, indicating that the impaired migration must be caused by impaired CCR7-mediated signalling, in the absence of Jak3. In addition, adoptive transfer experiments showed that Jak3⁺/⁺ mice reconstituted with Jak3⁻/⁻ green fluorescent protein (GFP)⁺ bone marrow progenitors had reduced T-lymphocyte homing to peripheral and mesenteric lymph nodes, compared to reconstitution with Jak3⁺/⁺ GFP⁺ progenitors. Furthermore, reciprocal transfer experiments indicated that Jak3⁻/⁻ stromal cells were not responsible for the deficient T-cell homing. Finally, we performed direct competitive homing assays and demonstrated that Jak3⁻/⁻ T lymphocytes have a clear defect in homing to peripheral and mesenteric lymph nodes, while migration to spleen was moderately impaired. Our data demonstrates that Jak3⁻/⁻ T lymphocytes have an intrinsic defect in CCR7-mediated homing to peripheral lymphoid organs. 0aCCR7 0ahoming 0achemokine 0aJanus kinase-3 0asignalling1 aLicona-Limón, Ileana1 aJiménez-Sólomon, M.

Animals—8 healthy adult horses. Procedures—Horses were anesthetized via IV administration of xylazine, ketamine, and diazepam; anesthesia was maintained with sevoflurane in oxygen. Approximately 1 hour after induction, sevoflurane MAC determination was initiated via standard techniques. Following sevoflurane MAC determination, lidocaine was administered as a bolus (1.3 mg/kg, IV, over 15 minutes), followed by constant rate infusion at 50 μg/kg/min. Determination of MAC for the lidocaine-sevoflurane combination was started 30 minutes after lidocaine infusion was initiated. Arterial blood samples were collected after the lidocaine bolus, at 30-minute intervals, and at the end of the infusion for measurement of plasma lidocaine concentrations. Results—IV administration of lidocaine decreased mean ± SD sevoflurane MAC from 2.42 ± 0.24% to 1.78 ± 0.38% (mean MAC reduction, 26.7 ± 12%). Plasma lidocaine concentrations were 2,589 ± 811 ng/mL at the end of the bolus; 2,065 ± 441 ng/mL, 2,243 ± 699 ng/mL, 2,168 ± 339 ng/mL, and 2,254 ± 215 ng/mL at 30, 60, 90, and 120 minutes of infusion, respectively; and 2,206 ± 329 ng/mL at the end of the infusion. Plasma concentrations did not differ significantly among time points. Conclusions and Clinical Relevance—Lidocaine could be useful for providing a more balanced anesthetic technique in horses. A detailed cardiovascular study on the effects of IV infusion of lidocaine during anesthesia with sevoflurane is required before this combination can be recommended. 3aadults 3aanesthesia 3ablood 3adiazepam 3ahorses 3aintravenous injection 3aketamine 3alidocaine 3aoxygen 3axylazine1 aWagner, Ann E.1 aMama, Khursheed R.1 aFerreira, Tatiana H.1 aSteffey, Eugene P.0 tAmerican journal of veterinary research.g2011 Apr., v. 72, no. 4 p.446-451x0002-96457nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2460/ajvr.72.4.4463Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle01011naa a2200265 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100001600115245005500131300001600186520027200202650001800474650002000492650002700512653002200539700001700561773009200578852000900670939003300679945000800712946001300720655001200733991614827530742620221120160919.0831108e198305  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aAGE839223292DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBaker, J.L.10aWater quality consequences of conservation tillage  ap. 186-193.  aExtract: Conservation tillage, which leaves some or all of the residue from the previous crop on the soil surface, effectively protects the soil against erosion.

  1 aBonsdorff, T.10aMapping of the bovine genes of the de novo AMP synthesis pathway  ap. 438-444.  a2019-12-05  aThe purine nucleotides adenosine monophosphate (AMP) and guanosine monophosphate (GMP) are critical for energy metabolism, cell signalling and cell reproduction. Despite their essential function, little is known about the regulation and in vivo expression pattern of the genes involved in the de novo purine synthesis pathway. The complete coding region of the bovine phosphoribosylaminoimidazole carboxylase gene (PAICS), which catalyses steps 6 and 7 of the de novo purine biosynthesis pathway, as well as bovine genomic sequences of the six other genes in the pathway producing inosine monophosphate (IMP) and AMP [phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate amidotransferase (PPAT), phosphoribosylglycinamide formyltransferase (GART), phosphoribosylformylglycinamidine synthase (PFAS), adenylosuccinate lyase (ADSL), 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribonucleotide formyltransferase/IMP cyclohydrolase (ATIC) and adenylosuccinate synthase (ADSS)], were identified. The genes were mapped to segments of six different bovine chromosomes using a radiation hybrid (RH) cell panel. The gene PPAT, coding for the presumed rate-limiting enzyme of the purine de novo pathway was closely linked to PAICS on BTA6. These, and the other bovine locations i.e. GART at BTA1, PFAS at BTA19, ADSL at BTA5, ATIC at BTA2 and ADSS at BTA16, are in agreement with published comparative maps of cattle and man. PAICS and PPAT genes are known to be closely linked in human, rat and chicken. Previously, an expressed sequence fragment of PAICS (Bos taurus corpus luteum, BTCL9) was mapped to BTA13. By isolation and characterization of a BAC clone, we have now identified a PAICS processed pseudogene sequence (PAICS) on BTA13.

The optimized parameters included ultrasound irradiating time 0-50min, reaction time 30-120min, succinic anhydride concentration by the ratio of dried sugarcane bagasse to succinic anhydride from 1:0.25 to 1:1.50, and reaction temperature 75-115°C are required in the process. The extent of succinoylation was measured by the weight percent gain (WPG), which increased with increments of reaction time, succinic anhydride concentration, and reaction temperature. The ultrasound irradiation has a positive effect on bagasse succinoylation process. On the other hand, the ultrasonic pre-treatment application broke down the cell wall polymers, resulting in, therefore, a negative effect on the WPG. Evidences of succinoylation were also provided by FT-IR and CP MAS ¹³C NMR and the results showed that the succinoylation at C-2 and C-3 occurred. The thermal stability of the succinylated bagasse decreased upon chemical modification. 3acell walls 3airradiation 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3apolymers 3asugarcane bagasse 3atemperature 3athermal stability 3aultrasonics 3aweight gain 2aCellulosexchemistryxradiation effects. 2aIndustrial Waste 2aRefuse Disposalxmethods 2aSaccharumxchemistry 2aSuccinic Anhydridesxchemistry 2aUltrasonics1 aSun, R.C.1 aQin, M.H.1 aZhang, A.P.1 aRen, J.L.1 aYe, J.1 aLuo, W.1 aCao, Z.N.0 tBioresource technology.g2008 Mar., v. 99, no. 5 p.1465-1473dElsevier Ltd.x0960-85247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2007.01.062 7aarticle01234naa a2200277 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100001600115245006100131300001600192520048400208650002400692650001400716650001500730650001900745650001400764651001800778773008500796852000900881939003300890945000800923946001300931655001200944991614826130742620221120150934.0831102e198306  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aAGE839222872DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWeiss, R.S.14aThe market and Massachusetts farmers, 1750-1850: comment  ap. 475-478.  aExtract: Most scholars attempt to locate the issues raised by their research in the broader context of previous work and debates in the field.

The professional audience consequently and properly withholds belief until an inference is shown to be adequately insensitive to the choice of assumptions.

If we are to make effective use of our scarce data resource, it is therefore important that we study fragility in a much more systematic way. 3aeconomic theory 3aeconometrics 3aeconomic analysis 3aquantitative analysis 0autilization 0aExperiment 0aMathematical analysis 0aSocioeconomic analysis0 tAmerican economic review.g1983 Mar., v. 73, no. 1 p.31-43x0002-82827nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19831102c00000000  aAGE  aOther US 7aarticle01012naa a2200289 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100001500115245007500130300001400205520019300219650001500412650001800427650002900445653001700474653003100491653003900522700001600561773007000577852000900647939003300656945000800689946001300697655001200710991614824730742620221120131033.0831101e198302  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aAGE839222692DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aReed, K.S.10aImpact of regulatory delays on the cost of wastewater treatment plants  ap. 35-42.  aExtract: The objective of this study is to evaluate the effects of time lags of various lengths on the present value of the future outflow of funds to pay for and operate treatment plants. 3awastewater 3acost analysis 3aenvironmental protection 0aconstruction 0aWaste treatment management 0aWater Pollution Control Act (1972)1 aYoung, C.E.0 tLand economics.g1983 Feb., v. 59, no. 1 p.35-42x0023-76397nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19831101c00000000  aAGE  aOther US 7aarticle02283naa a2200301 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092024002200134024001900156040001800175100002300193245009300216300001600309520129200325653001201617653000801629653002701637653002001664700003201684773010801716852000901824856009201833930003301925946001101958655001201969IND4395060620221120105202.0070916e200710  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439506062DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-2567.2007.02622.x2doi7 aPMC22660022pmcid7 a174847682pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKroger, Charles J.10aDose-dependent modulation of CD8 and functional avidity as a result of peptide encounter  ap. 167-178.  aThe generation of an optimal CD8⁺ cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) response is critical for the clearance of many intracellular pathogens. Previous studies suggest that one contributor to an optimal immune response is the presence of CD8⁺ cells exhibiting high functional avidity. In this regard, CD8 expression has been shown to contribute to peptide sensitivity. Here, we investigated the ability of naive splenocytes to modulate CD8 expression according to the concentration of stimulatory peptide antigen. Our results showed that the level of CD8 expressed was inversely correlated with the amount of peptide used for the primary stimulation, with higher concentrations of antigen resulting in lower expression of both CD8α and CD8β. Importantly the ensuing CD8low and CD8high CTL populations were not the result of the selective outgrowth of naive CD8⁺ T-cell subpopulations expressing distinct levels of CD8. Subsequent encounter with peptide antigen resulted in continued modulation of both the absolute level and the isoform of CD8 expressed and in the functional avidity of the responding cells. We propose that CD8 cell surface expression is not a static property, but can be modulated to 'fine tune' the sensitivity of responding CTL to a defined concentration of antigen. 0aavidity 0aCD8 0acytotoxic T lymphocyte 0adifferentiation1 aAlexander-Miller, Martha A.0 tImmunology.g2007 Oct., v. 122, no. 2 p.167-178dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0019-28057nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2567.2007.02622.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20070916b20071002c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02908naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001300110242011100123245012300234300001800357500002400375500001500399520185800414650001902272650001802291650001002309651001102319653001702330653001902347653001902366700001702385773011502402852000902517939003302526946001102559655001202570IND9203021920221120090629.0920515e199112  xx |||||o|||||||||||fre||7 aIND920302192DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCote, S.10aVariations in advanced regeneration of boreal fir stands is a function of their ecological characteristics10aVariation de la regeneration preetablie dans les sapinieres boreales en fonction de leurs caracteristiques ecologiques  ap. 1779-1795.  aSummary in English.  a2019-12-04  aThe renewal of boreal fir stands after harvesting is related to the abundance of fir advanced regeneration. The objective of this study was to compare the advanced regeneration in 45-years-old balsam fir stands of second growth to determine if ecological site conditions could explain some regeneration problems noted in the balsam fir--white birch ecoclimatic domain. Seven ecological phases were studied; these are among the most common in the Laurentians north of Quebec. On the basis of fir seedling densities (2 years old and more), three groups could be distinguished using a cluster analysis method for grouping means. Dry balsam fir--herb-and-moss type on well drained tills formed a first group characterized with very high seedling densities (> 60 000 seedlings/ha). A second group, characterized with high seedling densities (25 000-40 000 seedlings/ha), was constituted of three phases with an important moss cover: the mesic balsam fir--moss-and-herb type on moderately well drained tills, the humid balsam fir--moss-and-herb type on imperfectly drained tills with seepage, and the humid balsam fir--moss type on imperfectly drained tills. A third group, with low seedling densities (< 15 000 seedlings/ha), included three phases recognized by their important herb cover associated with a less abundant moss cover: the dry balsam fir--herb type on well drained till, the mesic balsam fir--white birch--herb type on moderately well drained till, and the mesic rich balsam fir--herb type on moderately well drained tills with seepage. Low densities of fir advanced regeneration seemed to be related to the abundance of leaf litter on the forest floor that could hinder fir regeneration. Insufficient natural coniferous regeneration can be anticipated in this last group if harvesting follows the 45-year rotation currently used now in Quebec. 3aboreal forests 3aforest litter 3aAbies 3aQuebec 0asite factors 0aadvance growth 0aforest ecology1 aBelanger, L.0 tCanadian journal of forest research =.g1991 Dec., v. 21, no. 12 p.1779-1795wJournal:jnl2003x0045-50677nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03013naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092024002200134024001900156040001800175100002100193245019600214300001600410520178500426650001502211653008002226653002302306653001502329653003202344700002702376700001902403773010802422852000902530856009202539930003302631946001102664655001202675IND4392927120221120090720.0070708e200708  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439292712DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-2567.2007.02606.x2doi7 aPMC22659662pmcid7 a174375322pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVinall, Shân L.12aA paracrine role for chemoattractant receptor-homologous molecule expressed on T helper type 2 cells (CRTH2) in mediating chemotactic activation of CRTH2⁺ CD4⁺ T helper type 2 lymphocytes  ap. 577-584.  aActivation of human CRTH2⁺ CD4⁺ T helper type 2 (Th2) cells with anti-CD3/anti-CD28 led to time-dependent production of prostaglandin D₂ (PGD₂) which peaked at 8 hr. The production of PGD₂ was completely inhibited by cotreatment with the cyclo-oxygenase inhibitor diclofenac (10 μ m) but was not affected by cotreatment with ramatroban, a dual antagonist of both the thromboxane-like prostanoid (TP) receptor and the chemoattractant receptor-homologous molecule expressed on Th2 cells (CRTH2). Supernatants from activated CRTH2⁺ CD4⁺ Th2 cells caused a concentration-dependent increase in the migration of naive CRTH2⁺ CD4⁺ Th2 cells compared to supernatants from unstimulated CRTH2⁺ CD4⁺ Th2 cells. The level of chemotactic activity peaked at 8 hr after activation, corresponding to the peak levels of PGD₂, but production of chemotactic activity was only partially inhibited by the cyclo-oxygenase inhibitor diclofenac. In contrast, ramatroban completely inhibited the chemotactic responses of naive Th2 cells to supernatants from activated CRTH2⁺ CD4⁺ Th2 cells collected up to 8 hr after activation, although supernatants collected 24 hr after activation were less sensitive to inhibition by ramatroban. The selective TP antagonist SQ29548 did not inhibit migration of Th2 cells, implicating CRTH2 in this response. These data suggest that CRTH2 plays an important paracrine role in mediating chemotactic activation of Th2 cells. Interestingly, although PGD₂ is produced from Th2 cells and contributes to this paracrine activation, it appears that additional CRTH2 agonist factors are also produced by activated Th2 cells and the production of these factors occurs independently of the cyclo-oxygenase pathway of the arachidonic acid metabolism. 3achemotaxis 0achemoattractant receptor-homologous molecule expressed on Th2 cells (CRTH2) 0aprostaglandin D₂ 0aramatroban 0aT helper type 2 lymphocytes1 aTownsend, Elizabeth R.1 aPettipher, Roy0 tImmunology.g2007 Aug., v. 121, no. 4 p.577-584dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0019-28057nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2567.2007.02606.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20070708b20070802c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03572naa a2200625 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153072000900171100002100180245011600201300001600317500002400333520157400357650000901931650001401940650002701954650000901981650001401990650002002004650001302024650001802037650001702055650001302072650001902085650002002104650006302124650001202187650005802199650000902257650001102266650002002277650004102297650000902338650005402347650005302401650004402454650004802498650001302546700001902559700001702578700001702595700001402612700001902626773013502645852000902780856007602789930003302865945002502898946001102923655001202934IND4384972020221120090740.0061105e200612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438497202DNAL7 a170834572pmid7 a10.1111/j.1365-2885.2006.00800.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL8101 aSTEAGALL, P.V.M.10aEffects of subcutaneous methadone, morphine, buprenorphine or saline on thermal and pressure thresholds in cats  ap. 531-537.  aIncludes references  aThis study compared pressure and thermal thresholds after administration of three opioids in eight cats. Pressure stimulation was performed via a bracelet taped around the forearm. Three ball-bearings were advanced against the forearm by inflation of a modified blood pressure bladder. Pressure in the cuff was recorded at the end point (leg shake and head turn). Thermal threshold was tested as previously reported using a heated probe held against the thorax [ Dixon et al. (2002) Research in Veterinary Science, 72, 205]. After baseline recordings, each cat received subcutaneous methadone 0.2 mg/kg, morphine 0.2 mg/kg, buprenorphine 0.02 mg/kg or saline 0.3 mL in a four period cross-over study. Measurements were made at 15, 30, 45 min and 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 12 and 24 h after the injection. Data were analysed by [smallcapital anova] (P < 0.05). There were no significant changes in thresholds after saline. Thermal threshold increased at 45 min after buprenorphine (maximum 2.8 ± 3 °C), 1-3 h after methadone (maximum 3.4 ± 1.9 °C) and 45 min to 1 h (maximum 3.4 ± 2 °C) after morphine. Pressure threshold increased 30-45 min (maximum 238 ± 206 mmHg) after buprenorphine, 45-60 min after methadone (maximum 255 ± 232 mmHg) and 45-60 min and 3-6 h (maximum 255 ± 232 mmHg) after morphine. Morphine provided the best analgesia, and methadone appears a promising alternative. Buprenorphines limited effect was probably related to the subcutaneous route of administration. Previously, buprenorphine has produced much greater effects when given by other routes. 3apain 3aanalgesia 3asubcutaneous injection 3acats 3amethadone 3adrug evaluation 3amorphine 3abuprenorphine 3asaline water 3apressure 3aheat tolerance 3ain vivo studies 2aAnalgesics, Opioidxadministration & dosagexpharmacology. 2aAnimals 2aBuprenorphinexadministration & dosagexpharmacology. 2aCats 2aFemale 2aHot Temperature 2aInjections, Subcutaneousxveterinary 2aMale 2aMethadonexadministration & dosagexpharmacology. 2aMorphinexadministration & dosagexpharmacology. 2aPainxprevention & controlxveterinary. 2aPain Measurementxdrug effectsxveterinary. 2aPressure1 aCARNICELLI, P.1 aTAYLOR, P.M.1 aLUNA, S.P.L.1 aDIXON, M.1 aFERREIRA, T.H.0 tJournal of veterinary pharmacology and therapeutics.g2006 Dec., v. 29, no. 6 p.531-537dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0140-77837nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2885.2006.00800.x3electronic resource  a20070307b20070402c00000000  aINDd3CTe2007/01/30  aNon-US 7aarticle02651naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092024002200134024001900156040001800175100002100193245010300214300001600317520154100333653001101874653003801885653003101923653003901954700002301993700002402016700002002040773010802060852000902168856009202177930003302269946001102302655001202313IND4396228520221120075248.0071021e200711  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439622852DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-2567.2007.02667.x2doi7 aPMC22660202pmcid7 a176277712pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKozłowska, Ewa.10aAge-related changes in the occurrence and characteristics of thymic CD4⁺ CD25⁺ T cells in mice  ap. 445-453.  aNatural regulatory CD4⁺ CD25⁺ T cells play an important role in preventing autoimmunity by maintaining self-tolerance. They express CD25 constitutively and are produced in the thymus as a functionally mature T-cell population. Changes in the potential of these cells to regulate the activity of conventional effector lymphocytes may contribute to an increased susceptibility to infection, cancer and age-associated autoimmune diseases. In this study we demonstrated that the thymi of aged mice are populated by a higher percentage of CD4⁺ CD25⁺ thymocytes than in young animals. The expression of several surface markers (CD69, CD5, CD28, CTLA-4, CD122, FOXP3), usually used to characterize the phenotype of CD4⁺ CD25⁺ T regulatory cells, was compared between young and aged mice. We also examined the ability of sorted thymus-deriving regulatory T cells of young and aged BALB/c mice to inhibit the proliferation of lymph node lymphocytes activated in vitro. Natural regulatory T cells isolated from the thymi of young mice suppress the proliferation of responder lymph node cells. We demonstrated that thymus-deriving CD4⁺ CD25⁺ T cells of old mice maintain their potential to suppress the proliferation of activated responder lymphocytes of young mice. However, their potential to inhibit the proliferation of old responder T cells is abrogated. Differences in the occurrence and activity of CD4⁺ CD25⁺ thymocytes between young and old animals are discussed in relation to the expression of these surface markers. 0aageing 0aCD4⁺ CD25⁺ regulatory T cells 0anatural regulatory T cells 0athymus-deriving regulatory T cells1 aBiernacka, Marzena1 aCiechomska, Marzena1 aDrela, Nadzieja0 tImmunology.g2007 Nov., v. 122, no. 3 p.445-453dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0019-28057nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2567.2007.02667.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20071021b20071102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02929naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092024002200134024001900156040001800175100002400193245009200217300001400309520168100323650001702004650001902021650001802040653007102058653002002129653002102149700002202170700001702192700002302209700002702232700001802259700002002277773010502297852000902402856007602411930003302487946001102520655001202531IND4390191520221120075148.0070408e200705  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439019152DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-2567.2006.02518.x2doi7 aPMC22659172pmcid7 a172391992pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZafranskaya, Marina10aInterferon-β therapy reduces CD4⁺ and CD8⁺ T-cell reactivity in multiple sclerosis  ap. 29-39.  aTherapy with interferon-β (IFN-β) has well-established clinical effects in multiple sclerosis (MS), albeit the immunomodulatory mechanisms are not fully understood. We assessed the prevalence and functional capacity of CD4⁺ and CD8⁺ T cells in healthy donors, and in untreated and IFN-β-treated MS patients, in response to myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG). The proportion of CD45RO⁺ memory T cells was higher in MS patients than in healthy donors, but returned to normal values upon therapy with IFN-β. While CD45RO⁺ CD4⁺ T cells from all three groups responded to MOG in vitro, untreated patients showed augmented proliferative responses compared to healthy individuals and IFN-β treatment reduced this elevated reactivity back to the values observed in healthy donors. Similarly, the response of CD45RO⁺ CD8⁺ T cells to MOG was strongest in untreated patients and decreased to normal values upon immunotherapy. Overall, the frequency of peripheral CD45RO⁺ memory T cells ex vivo correlated with the strength of the cellular in vitro response to MOG in untreated patients but not in healthy donors or IFN-β-treated patients. Compared with healthy individuals, responding CD4⁺ and CD8⁺ cells were skewed towards a type 1 cytokine phenotype in untreated patients, but towards a type 2 phenotype under IFN-β therapy. Our data suggest that the beneficial effect of IFN-β in MS might be the result of the suppression or depletion of autoreactive, pro-inflammatory memory T cells in the periphery. Assessment of T-cell subsets and their reactivity to MOG may represent an important diagnostic tool for monitoring successful immunotherapy in MS. 3aautoimmunity 3adisease course 3aimmunotherapy 0aCFSE (5- (and 6-) carboxyfluorescein diacetate succinimidyl ester) 0amyelin antigens 0aT-cell responses1 aOschmann, Patrick1 aEngel, Rosel1 aWeishaupt, Andreas1 avan Noort, Johannes M.1 aJomaa, Hassan1 aEberl, Matthias0 tImmunology.g2007 May, v. 121, no. 1 p.29-39dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0019-28057nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2567.2006.02518.x3electronic resource  a20070408b20070502c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle04115naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127072000900145072000900154072000900163100001800172245009400190300001800284500002400302500001500326520241300341650001202754650002902766650001902795650001602814650002102830650002602851650001402877650002502891650000902916650001002925650002702935650001902962650001502981650001902996650001403015650002203029650002203051650002703073651001203100653001303112653001703125653002403142700002303166700002903189700002403218773012403242852000903366856006903375930003303444945002503477946001103502655001203513IND4384959020221120064432.0061105e200611  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438495902DNAL7 a10.1007/s10722-005-7761-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF200 0aF300 0aB2001 aMakrem, Afif 10aGenetic Diversity in Tunisian Ceratonia siliqua L. (Caesalpinioideae) Natural Populations  ap. 1501-1511.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThe last two centuries witnessed the human-caused fragmentation of Tunisian Ceratonia siliqua L. (Caesalpinoideae) populations which were often represented by scattered individuals. Seventeen populations growing in four bioclimatic zones: sub-humid, upper semi-arid, mean semi-arid and lower semi-arid zones, were sampled for allozyme diversity to assess their genetic diversity and structuration using eight isozymes revealed by starch gel electrophoresis. The species showed high diversity within populations. The average number of alleles per polymorphic locus was 1.98, the percentage of polymorphic loci was 83.4% and the mean observed heterozygosity (Ho) and expected heterozygosity (He) under Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium were respectively 0.247 and 0.316. A substantial level of inbreeding within populations induced by Wahlund effect, was observed (F IS = 0.231). High diversity resulted from the great number of genotypes in the ancestral population before fragmentation, favoured by the outbreeding of the species. High differentiation and low gene flow were detected among populations (F ST = 0.200) and among pairs of ecological zones (0.113< F ST <0.198). However, the differentiation coefficient of the four zones was low (F ST = 0.085) and similar to the average F ST for forest trees. Population structuration depends on geographic distance between sites rather than bioclimate, indicating that structuration has occurred slowly and that climatic conditions have had little effect. Nei's genetic distances (D) between populations were low and ranged from 0.004 to 0.201. Mean D value for all population was 0.087. The UPGMA clustering established for all populations through Nei's genetic distances did not clearly show that, for the majority of populations, grouping had resulted from ecological factors or geographic location. The substantial differentiation and the high genetic similarities between populations indicate that populations have been recently isolated as a result of anthropic pressure. In-situ conservation strategies must first focus on populations with a high level of genetic diversity and rare alleles. Appropriate conservation action should take account of bioclimatic zones. Ex-situ preservation should be based on a maximum number of individuals collected within populations in each ecological group and their propagation in different bioclimates by means of cuttings. 3aalleles 3aanthropogenic activities 3aclimatic zones 3awild plants 3agenetic distance 3ahabitat fragmentation 3aallozymes 3agenetic polymorphism 3aloci 3acarob 3ageographical variation 3aheterozygosity 3ainbreeding 3aphytogeography 3agene flow 3aCeratonia siliqua 3agenetic variation 3agermplasm conservation 3aTunisia 0aisozymes 0arare alleles 0apopulation genetics1 aNajeh, Ben Fadhel 1 aLaarbi, Khoudja Mohamed 1 aMohamed, Boussaïd 0 tGenetic resources and crop evolution.g2006 Nov., v. 53, no. 7 p.1501-1511dKluwer Academic Publishersx0925-98647nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10722-005-7761-53electronic resource  a20070305b20070402c00000000  aINDd2CTe2007/01/17  aNon-US 7aarticle02971naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092024002200134024001900156040001800175100002200193245012800215300001600343500001500359520179700374650001602171650001102187653001302198653003002211653002102241700002002262700002302282700002102305700001802326773010802344852000902452856009202461930003302553946001102586655001202597IND4395060720221120053337.0070916e200710  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439506072DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-2567.2007.02623.x2doi7 aPMC22660092pmcid7 a174847672pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMorales, Pedro J.10aSynthesis of β₂-microglobulin-free, disulphide-linked HLA-G5 homodimers in human placental villous cytotrophoblast cells  ap. 179-188.  a2019-12-05  aHuman leucocyte antigen-G (HLA-G) is a natural immunosuppressant produced in human placentas that binds differently to the inhibitory leucocyte immunoglobulin-like receptors LILRB1 (ILT2) and LILRB2 (ILT4) according to its biochemical structure. To predict the binding functions of the HLA-G5 soluble isoform synthesized in placental villous cytotrophoblast (vCTB) cells, we investigated structural features of this protein. Biochemical and immunological studies showed that vCTB cell HLA-G5 heavy (H)-chain proteins are disulphide-bonded homodimers unassociated with β₂-microglobulin (β2m) light-chain proteins. Although comparatively low levels of β2m messenger RNA (mRNA) were identified by real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, immunoprecipitation studies failed to detect β2m protein even when specific mRNA was doubled by transduction of a lentivirus-β2m complementary DNA into vCTB cells. No abnormalities were identified in the translational start codon of vCTB cell β2m mRNA and differentiation into syncytium did not promote β2m synthesis. The failure of vCTB cells to exhibit β2m in vitro was paralleled by a lack of detectable β2m in vCTB cells in vivo. Lack of the β2m protein could be the result of low levels of β2m transcripts or of as yet unidentified translational defects. Experiments with recombinant ectodomains of LILRB indicate that β2m-free HLA-G binds strongly to LILRB2, a receptor that is expressed by macrophages. This potentially immunosuppressive cell type is abundant in the pregnant uterus. Thus, our findings are consistent with the postulate that the natural β2m-free homodimeric form of HLA-G5 synthesized in primary vCTB cells could comprise a particularly effective tolerogenic molecule at the maternal-fetal interface. 3atrophoblast 3ahumans 0aplacenta 0ahuman leucocyte antigen G 0aimmune privilege1 aPace, Judith L.1 aPlatt, Jeralyn Sue1 aLangat, Daudi K.1 aHunt, Joan S.0 tImmunology.g2007 Oct., v. 122, no. 2 p.179-188dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0019-28057nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2567.2007.02623.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20070916b20071002c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02650naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092024002200134024001900156040001800175100001900193245011200212300001600324500001500340520145100355650001801806650001701824650001401841650001101855653002101866653000901887700002501896700002301921700001501944700001901959700002101978773010801999852000902107856009202116930003302208946001102241655001202252IND4395061220221120053426.0070916e200710  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439506122DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-2567.2007.02632.x2doi7 aPMC22659962pmcid7 a178481632pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIsogai, Susumu10aInterferon-γ-dependent inhibition of late allergic airway responses and eosinophilia by CD8⁺γδ T cells  ap. 230-238.  a2019-12-05  aWe have previously shown that CD8⁺γδ T cells decrease late allergic airway responses, airway eosinophilia, T helper 2 cytokine expression and increase interferon-γ (IFN-γ) expression. We hypothesized that the effects of CD8⁺γδ T cells were IFN-γ mediated. Brown Norway rats were sensitized to ovalbumin on day 1. Cervical lymph node CD8⁺γδ T cells from sensitized animals were treated with antisense oligodeoxynucleotide (5 μmol/l) to inhibit IFN-γ synthesis or control oligodeoxynucleotide and 3·5 x 10⁴ CD8⁺γδ T cells were injected intraperitoneally into sensitized recipients on day 13. Rats were challenged with aerosolized ovalbumin on day 15 and lung resistance was monitored over an 8 hr period, after which bronchoalveolar lavage was performed. Control oligodeoxynucleotide treated γδ T cells decreased late airway responses and eosinophilia in bronchoalveolar lavage. There was a complete recovery of late airway responses and a partial recovery of airway eosinophilia in recipients of antisense oligodeoxynucleotide treated cells. Macrophage ingestion of eosinophils was frequent in rats administered γδT cells but reduced in recipients of antisense oligodeoxynucleotide treated cells. These results indicate that CD8⁺γδ T cells inhibit late airway responses and airway eosinophilia through the secretion of IFN-γ. Defective or altered γδ T-cell function may account for some forms of allergic asthma. 3aT-lymphocytes 3ainflammation 3acytokines 3aasthma 0ahypersensitivity 0alung1 aAthiviraham, Aravind1 aFraser, Russell S.1 aTaha, Rame1 aHamid, Qutayba1 aMartin, James G.0 tImmunology.g2007 Oct., v. 122, no. 2 p.230-238dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0019-28057nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2567.2007.02632.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20070916b20071002c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02809naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127072000900145072000900154100002300163245014200186300001800328500002400346520131500370650001601685650001101701650002101712650001201733650002001745650002201765650001401787650003101801650001401832650001901846650000901865650001201874650001901886650002001905650002101925650002601946650002201972650001501994700002302009773012402032852000902156856006902165930003302234945002502267946001102292655001202303IND4384958920221120053253.0061105e200611  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438495892DNAL7 a10.1007/s10722-005-7469-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF600 0aF2001 aGökçe, Ali Fuat 10aSelection at the Ms locus in open pollinated onion (Allium cepa L.) populations possessing S-cytoplasm or mixtures of N- and S-cytoplasms  ap. 1495-1499.  aIncludes references  aThe bulb onion (Allium cepa L.) was historically seed propagated by open pollination (OP). Cytoplasmic-genic male sterility (CMS) and protandry encourage outcrossing among individual onion plants. The most common source of CMS in onion is conditioned by the interaction of sterile (S) cytoplasm with a single nuclear male-fertility restoration (Ms) locus. We previously reported that the majority of OP onion populations possess normal (N) male-fertile cytoplasm and varying frequencies of the dominant Ms allele. It was unclear why N-cytoplasmic onion populations often possess relatively high frequencies of the Ms allele, which has no obvious function. We used computer simulations to estimate changes in allelic frequencies at Ms for onion populations possessing S-cytoplasm or a mixture of N- and S-cytoplasms, and to determine if frequencies of the Ms allele stay constant or change due to failure of male gamete production from male-sterile (S msms) plants. The models revealed selection against the recessive ms allele over generations in onion populations possessing S-cytoplasm and varying amounts of self pollination and inbreeding depression. These models were consistent with field and molecular analyses documenting that N-cytoplasm and the dominant Ms allele predominate in OP onion populations. 3aAllium cepa 3aonions 3aopen pollination 3aselfing 3aplant fertility 3anatural selection 3acytoplasm 3acytoplasmic male sterility 3aprotandry 3arestorer lines 3aloci 3aalleles 3agene frequency 3arecessive genes 3aself-pollination 3ainbreeding depression 3asimulation models 3agerm cells1 aHavey, Michael J. 0 tGenetic resources and crop evolution.g2006 Nov., v. 53, no. 7 p.1495-1499dKluwer Academic Publishersx0925-98647nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10722-005-7469-63electronic resource  a20070305b20070402c00000000  aINDd2CTe2007/01/17  aNon-US 7aarticle03432naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127072000900145100001500154245010000169300001800269500028600287500002400573520178000597650002602377650002602403650002202429650002502451650002402476650001802500650001202518650001302530650001502543650001902558650001702577651001202594653001702606653002102623700001702644700001802661700001702679773010702696852000902803856006902812930003302881945002502914946001102939655001202950IND4384963220221120041746.0061105e200610  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438496322DNAL7 a10.1007/s10530-005-5840-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF3001 aWu, Yegang14aThe spatial pattern and dispersion of Lygodium microphyllum in the Everglades wetland ecosystem  ap. 1483-1493.  aIn the special issue: Beijing International Symposium on Biological Invasions / edited by S.

Paper presented at the symposium "Species Exchanges between Eastern Asia and North America: Threats to Environment and Economy", 2004, Beijing, China.  aIncludes references  aSince 1958, L. microphyllum (Old World Climbing Fern), which originated from the Old World Tropics, has become a nuisance exotic and has rapidly spread and is being established system-wide in extremely remote and undisturbed areas such as the Florida Everglades. Of particular concern is that L. microphyllum is disrupting, at an alarming rate, the flora and fauna of the native ecosystem at the same time that a major 8.4 billion dollar Everglades restoration program is trying to enhance these same attributes. This research utilized IKONOS satellite data to map L. microphyllum within the 58,000-ha Loxahatchee National Wildlife Refuge wetland in south Florida. Results show that approximately 11.6% of the tree/shrub vegetation within the impoundment has been infected by L. microphyllum. These data were then utilized to explore the spatial spread patterns of L. microphyllum within the Refuge. Results suggest that L. microphyllum is more likely to establish on the southeast side of a tree/shrub island and then spread to the northwest, which corresponds to the prevailing wind direction in south Florida. Spatial pattern analysis of L. microphyllum spread indicated that it is correlated with the density and spatial distribution of tree/shrub island vegetation. It appears that the dispersion of L. microphyllum is density dependent, which can be expressed as a logistic function and has a catastrophic threshold of 160 m of mean distance between tree/shrub islands in the Everglades. It is predicted that 38% (or 1910 ha) of tree/shrub islands in the Refuge will be invaded by L. microphyllum by 2012. Tree islands in the Everglades wetland could be considered similar to oceanic islands throughout the world that are notoriously vulnerable to biological invasions. 3aLygodium microphyllum 3aferns and fern allies 3aintroduced plants 3aspatial distribution 3aecological invasion 3aplant density 3aislands 3awetlands 3aecosystems 3aremote sensing 3aspatial data 3aFlorida 0atree islands 0aIKONOS satellite1 aRutchey, Ken1 aWang, Naiming1 aGodin, Jason0 tBiological invasions.g2006 Oct., v. 8, no. 7 p.1483-1493dKluwer Academic Publishersx1387-35477nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10530-005-5840-33electronic resource  a20061201b20070102c00000000  aINDdNZMe2006/11/30  aNon-US 7aarticle01420naa a2200289 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245008100127300001800208500002300226520059100249650001800840650001700858650002500875650002500900651001100925700001500936700001600951773009800967852000901065939003301074946001101107655001201118IND9203022520221120031917.0920515e199112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920302252DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDelwaide, A.10aSpatiotemporal distribution of light rings in subarctic black spruce, Quebec  ap. 1828-1832.  aSummary in French.  aNumerous subfossil trees from the 13th, 14th, and 15th centuries sampled in the Riviere Boniface area (east of Hudson Bay) made it possible to extend to A.D. 1221 a previously published light-ring chronology.

A preliminary investigation had indicated that seed yields were less than expected, and nonsynchronous flowering phenology due to wide genetic diversity was considered as a possible cause. The clones were divided into six regions based on geographic origin and analyzed for variation between regions and between clones within regions. Most variation in cones per tree and filled seeds per cone was due to differences between clones. Most variation in weight per seed was due to differences between regions. The order in which clones began releasing pollen and became receptive remained the same from year to year, but the duration of these events differed between years. Results indicated that nonsynchronous flowering phenology due to genetic diversity is not a likely cause of low seed yield. Seed crops (19.3 kg/ha, 97 000 seeds/kg) were not necessarily lower than should be expected, but 90% of a given year's crop was produced by an average of only 26 clones. With the paternal contribution of each clone to the seed crop unknown, collecting and sowing seed separately by clone is recommended. 3aPinus sylvestris 3aclones 3aflowering 3aseed cones 3apollen 3aphenology 3ayields 3agenetic variation 3aseed orchards 3aNebraska 0adiversity 0arelease 0aseed-cone receptivity1 aBrandle, J.R.1 aLovett, W.R.0 tCanadian journal of forest research =.g1991 Dec., v. 21, no. 12 p.1721-1729x0045-50677nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle01887naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110100002300127245010900150300001600259520064000275650001100915650002200926650002500948650002200973650001200995650001501007650001401022650002701036650002101063651001501084653001601099653002801115700002401143700002001167700001701187700001501204700002801219700001701247700001401264773007301278852000901351930003301360945002501393946001101418655001201429IND4371521420221117182229.0050617e200506  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437152142DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Phylogenetical analysis showed that these ancient horse's sequences, along with two Yakut ones, were distributed throughout the tree defined by modern horses' sequences and are closely related to them. No clear geographical affiliation of the specimens studied was thus determined.

The functions appear suitable for this forest type, although the volumes of veteran trees with severely damaged crowns are underestimated. 3aforests 3aEucalyptus marginata 3avolume 3aaerial photography 3aprediction 3aWestern Australia0 tCanadian journal of forest research =.g1991 Dec., v. 21, no. 12 p.1823-1828x0045-50677nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02202naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134072000900152100002900161245003700190300001800227500002400245500001500269520068400284650002100968650001200989650001401001650002501015650001701040650001001057650001501067650002501082650001801107650001401125650002401139650001401163650001501177650002201192653002001214653002301234653001801257653002101275653002001296700002101316700002701337773013701364852000901501856009301510930003301603945002501636946001101661655001201672IND4384977120221123041858.0061105e200612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438497712DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-2621.2005.01112.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aW0001 aArvanitoyannis, Ioannis.10aWine waste treatment methodology  ap. 1117-1151.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aAs more than 20% of wine production is waste, the latter constitutes a serious environmental problem that has to be solved urgently.

This study aimed to clarify the molecular mechanisms by monitoring inflammatory and antioxidant mediator actions in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced mouse paw edema and macrophage cell model. LCBP significantly attenuated LPS-induced paw edema (3.0 ± 0.1 to 2.8 ± 0.1 mm, P < 0.05) and reduced (P < 0.05) serum levels of monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1, 100.9 ± 2.3 to 58.3 ± 14.5 ng/mL), interleukin (IL)-10 (1596.1 ± 424.3 to 709.7 ± 65.7 pg/mL), macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-1α (1761.9 ± 208.3 to 1369.1 ± 56.4 pg/mL), IL-6 (1262.8 ± 71.7 to 499.0 ± 67.1 pg/mL), IL-4 (93.3 ± 25.7 to 50.7 ± 12.5 pg/mL), IL-12(p-70) (580.4 ± 132.0 to 315.2 ± 35.1 pg/mL), and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α, 2045.5 ± 264.9 to 1270.7 ± 158.6 pg/mL). Cell signaling analysis revealed that LCBP inhibited transforming growth factor β activated kinase-1 (TAK1)-mediated mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) pathways, and enhanced the expression of nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2 (Nrf2) and manganese-dependent superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) in earlier response. Moreover, cyanidin 3-glucoside (C3G) and (−)-epicatechin (EC), two major components of LCBP, directly bound to TAK1. These data demonstrated that LCBP might inhibit LPS-induced inflammation by modulating both inflammatory and antioxidant mediators. 3aLonicera caerulea 3aantioxidants 3abioactive properties 3ablood serum 3achemokine CCL2 3acyanidin 3aedema 3ainflammation 3ainterleukin-12 3ainterleukin-4 3ainterleukin-6 3alipopolysaccharides 3amacrophages 3amice 3amitogen-activated protein kinase 3amodels 3amonitoring 3apolyphenols 3asuperoxide dismutase 3atranscription factor NF-kappa B 3atransforming growth factor beta 3atumor necrosis factor-alpha1 aYano, Satoshi1 aChen, Jihua1 aHisanaga, Ayami1 aSakao, Kozue1 aHe, Xi1 aHe, Jianhua1 aHou, De-Xing0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2017 June 28, v. 65, no. 25 p.5133-5141dAmerican Chemical Society, Books and Journals DivisionwJournal:12177x0021-85617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jafc.7b01599  aDNAL 7aarticle02361naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003000092024002200122024001900144040001800163100002500181245006500206300001600271500002400287506007600311520115000387506003701537650002001574650002001594650001101614651001501625651001901640700001901659700001801678700001501696700002101711700002101732773013301753852000901886856008001895655001201975IND4400909220221207102853.0080203e20080201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440090922DNAL7 a10.1128/AEM.01537-072doi7 aPMC22277132pmcid7 a180656112pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGrim, Christopher J.10aOccurrence and Expression of Luminescence in Vibrio cholerae  ap. 708-715.  aIncludes references  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aSeveral species of the genus Vibrio, including Vibrio cholerae, are bioluminescent or contain bioluminescent strains. Previous studies have reported that only 10% of V. cholerae strains are luminescent. Analysis of 224 isolates of non-O1/non-O139 V. cholerae collected from Chesapeake Bay, MD, revealed that 52% (116/224) were luminescent when an improved assay method was employed and 58% (130/224) of isolates harbored the luxA gene. In contrast, 334 non-O1/non-O139 V. cholerae strains isolated from two rural provinces in Bangladesh yielded only 21 (6.3%) luminescent and 35 (10.5%) luxA⁺ isolates. An additional 270 clinical and environmental isolates of V. cholerae serogroups O1 and O139 were tested, and none were luminescent or harbored luxA. These results indicate that bioluminescence may be a trait specific for non-O1/non-O139 V. cholerae strains that frequently occur in certain environments. Luminescence expression patterns of V. cholerae were also investigated, and isolates could be grouped based on expression level. Several strains with defective expression of the lux operon, including natural K variants, were identified.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aVibrio cholerae 3abioluminescence 3aoperon 3aBangladesh 3aChesapeake Bay1 aTaviani, Elisa1 aAlam, Munirul1 aHuq, Anwar1 aSack, R.

Bip. as a Preliminary Approach for Weed Control  ap. 5161-5172.  aFarmers of the Franca region in Brazil observed that Bidens sulphurea was able to eliminate the Panicum maximum weed, which infected coffee plantations, without affecting the crop. In an effort to determine if the inhibitory effects observed were due to the presence of phytotoxic compounds from leaves and roots, a biodirected isolation and spectroscopic characterization has been carried out. The leaf dichloromethane and root acetone extracts were the most active, and the former appeared to be more phytotoxic to the target species, including four weeds. A total of 26 compounds were isolated from leaves and roots, and four of them are described here for the first time. The major compounds in the leaf extract are the sesquiterpene lactones costunolide, reynosin, and santamarine, and these showed marked inhibition. Amaranthus viridis and Panicum maximum were the most sensitive species of the weeds tested. These three phytotoxic lactones were also evaluated on A. viridis and P. maximum under hydroponic conditions. A. viridis was the most affected species with the three lactones, and santamarine was the most phytotoxic compound on both. This is the first time that the phytotoxicity of sesquiterpene lactones has been evaluated on hydroponic culture. The work described here is a preliminary approach for the use of B. sulphurea for weed control in agriculture, both as a cover crop and by use of its components as natural herbicide leads. 3aAmaranthus viridis 3aBidens 3aMegathyrsus maximus 3aacetone 3acover crops 3afarmers 3aherbicides 3ahydroponics 3aleaf extracts 3aleaves 3amethylene chloride 3aphytotoxicity 3aplantations 3aroots 3asesquiterpenoid lactones 3aspectral analysis 3aweed control 3aBrazil1 aNepomuceno, Mariluce P.1 aVarela, Rosa M.1 aTorres, Ascension1 aMolinillo, Jose M.

Our objective was to assess how copper root pruning affects the quality and root system development of longleaf pine seedlings grown in three cavity sizes in a greenhouse. Copper root pruning increased seedling size, the allocation of root system dry weight to the taproot, and the fraction of fibrous root mass allocated to secondary lateral roots compared with primary lateral roots. It decreased the allocation of root system dry weight to primary lateral roots and led to a distribution of root growth potential that more closely resembled the root growth of naturally sown seedlings. These effects of copper root pruning may benefit longleaf pine establishment. However, because copper root pruning increased competition for cavity growing space among the taproot and fibrous roots, we suggest that recommendations regarding cavity size and seedling quality parameters be tailored for copper-coated cavities. 3afibrous roots 3agreenhouses 3aplanting 3apruning 3aroot growth 3aroots 3aseedlings1 aSung, Shi-Jean Susana1 aHaywood, James D.0 tSouthern journal of applied forestry.g2011 Feb., v. 35, no. 1 p.5-11dSociety of American Forestersx0148-44197nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle02390naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001600146245020000162300001800362520102700380650003401407650001601441650001701457650002501474650002401499650001501523650001101538650002301549650001801572650002601590650001401616650001901630700001601649700002101665700002101686700002201707700001801729773017701747856004701924852000901971655001201980IND60579800520221123015243.0170901e20170628xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057980052DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jafc.7b013522doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRen, Feiyue10aHigher Antioxidant Activity, Total Flavonols, and Specific Quercetin Glucosides in Two Different Onion (Allium cepa L.)

Antioxidant activity (DPPH and FRAP), total flavonol content, and levels of Q 3,4′ D and Q 3 G were higher in both varieties under fully organic compared to fully conventional management. Total flavonoids were higher in ‘Red Baron’ and when onions were grown under organic soil treatment. Differences were primarily due to different soil management practices used in organic agriculture rather than pesticide/ herbicide application. 3a2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl 3aAllium cepa 3aanthocyanins 3aantioxidant activity 3abioactive compounds 3aglucosides 3aonions 3aorganic production 3aorganic soils 3apesticide application 3aquercetin 3asoil treatment1 aReilly, Kim1 aKerry, Joseph P.1 aGaffney, Michael1 aHossain, Mohammad1 aRai, Dilip K.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2017 June 28, v. 65, no. 25 p.5122-5132dAmerican Chemical Society, Books and Journals DivisionwJournal:12177x0021-85617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jafc.7b01352  aDNAL 7aarticle02800naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001800145245009900163300001600262500002400278500002400302520154400326650001801870650001301888650001401901650001301915650002201928650001301950650001301963650002101976650002601997650001802023650001302041650001302054650001602067650001502083700002102098700002402119700001902143773011002162852000902272856008502281655001202366IND4459686820110711000000.0110707s2011    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445968682DNAL7 a10.1007/s12230-010-9178-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKülen, Oktay10aGibberellic Acid and Ethephon Alter Potato Minituber Bud Dormancy and Improve Seed Tuber Yield  ap. 167-174.  aIncludes references  aSummary in Spanish.  aWhile greenhouse production of minitubers has markedly improved production of disease free seed, minituber dormancy can be an issue. This study tested application of abscisic acid (ABA), ethylene (E), gibberellic acid (GA) and the combination of E+GA on release of dormancy in potato minitubers, sprout development, and subsequent effects on field plant growth and yield of seed tubers. Cultivars were categorized on the basis of known dormancy responses as follows: (1) one short dormancy cultivar, Silverton Russet, (2) three intermediate dormancy cultivars, Russet Norkotah (RNK), Sangre S-14 and Desiree, and (3) two long dormancy cultivars, Nooksack and Russet Norkotah Selection 3 (RNK-S3). Eighty eight to 93% of E+GA treated minitubers from cultivars in the long dormancy group developed sprouts signaling the end of dormancy within 5 weeks, while the control and ABA treated minitubers were totally dormant with 0% bud break. With the intermediate cultivars E+GA treated minitubers had 100% bud break compared to 37 to 55% bud break in the control minitubers. Treated long dormant minitubers also had 2.1 to 2.5 more sprouts per minituber and 1.6 to 2.4 cm longer sprouts. E+GA treated minitubers planted in field plot trials produced mature plants that were 19 to 36 cm per plant taller, with up to 3.9 to 8.8 more seed tubers per plant, and 1.9 to 4.2 kg per plot higher yields. The laboratory protocol developed to predict dormancy breaking attributes provided a reasonable estimate of cultivar dormancy under field conditions. 3aabscisic acid 3abudbreak 3acultivars 3adormancy 3adormancy breaking 3aethephon 3aethylene 3agibberellic acid 3agreenhouse production 3amature plants 3aplanting 3apotatoes 3aseed tubers 3aseed yield1 aStushnoff, Cecil1 aDavidson, Robert D.1 aHolm, David G.0 tAmerican journal of potato research.g2011 Apr., v. 88, no. 2 p.167-174dThe Associationx1099-209X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12230-010-9178-83Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02758naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001500145245011000160300001600270500002400286500002400310520135800334650002701692650003901719650001401758650001901772650001301791650001201804650001101816650001301827650001101840650001101851650001101862650002201873650001201895650001101907651001001918651001001928651001101938651000901949700001401958700001901972700002001991700001502011700002202026773011002048852000902158856008502167655001202252IND4459687220221123003108.0110707s2011    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445968722DNAL7 a10.1007/s12230-010-9174-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Canhui10aCooperation-88: A High Yielding, Multi-Purpose, Late Blight Resistant Cultivar Growing in Southwest China  ap. 190-194.  aIncludes references  aSummary in Spanish.  aCooperation-88 (C88) is a high yielding potato cultivar with durable resistance to Phytophthora infestans Mont. de Bary and excellent virus resistance. This has permitted the cultivar to rapidly increase its production area in Yunnan Province of China, as well as in neighboring provinces and countries. C88 is the result of a cross between I-1085, a clone from India selected for late blight (LB) resistance in Mexico and distributed by the International Potato Center (CIP), and a bulk pollen of a poorly adapted but highly LB resistant population with its origin in Solanum andigena from CIP Peru. C88 has excellent vegetative growth; it is late maturing under the long day summer growing season in Yunnan Province. It is much earlier maturing under the low elevation and warmer winter season of Yunnan. Experimental yields ranged from 23 to 55 t/ha, out-yielding the control cultivar Mira by 5% to 76%. Tuber quality is excellent, garnering a premium price in the markets. C88 has also become the preferred cultivar for the chipping potato industry, which uses medium-sized tubers, while the larger ones go for the fresh table market. Current estimates place the total area under production at 390,000 ha in Yunnan and its neighboring provinces, making C88 one of the most widely grown cultivars in the world today, less than 15 years after release. 3aPhytophthora infestans 3aSolanum tuberosum subsp. andigenum 3acultivars 3agrowing season 3aindustry 3amarkets 3apollen 3apotatoes 3aprices 3asummer 3atubers 3avegetative growth 3aviruses 3awinter 3aChina 3aIndia 3aMexico 3aPeru1 aWang, Jun1 aChien, Dao Huy1 aChujoy, Enrique1 aSong, Bofu1 aVanderZaag, Peter0 tAmerican journal of potato research.g2011 Apr., v. 88, no. 2 p.190-194dThe Associationx1099-209X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12230-010-9174-z3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02225naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004600092040001800138100001600156245009700172300001600269500002400285500002400309520098200333650001601315650002201331650001401353650001501367650001401382650003501396650001101431650001401442650001301456650002001469650000901489700001201498700001301510700001501523700001401538700001101552700001301563773011001576852000901686856009601695655001201791IND4459686520221123003051.0110707s2011    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445968652DNAL7 a10.1007/s12230-010-9173-0Open Access2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Xiyao10aEctopic Expression of AtCIPK23 Enhances Tolerance Against Low-K+ Stress in Transgenic Potato  ap. 153-159.  aIncludes references  aSummary in Spanish.  aPotato (Solanum tuberosum L.) has a relatively high requirement for potassium (K+). In the face of the declining of potato yield and quality as a result of reduction of soil K+ content, it is necessary to determine how to improve the tolerance of potatoes to low-K+ stresses. The protein kinase AtCIPK23 is essential for K+ uptake, and its overexpression significantly enhances K+ uptake and tolerance to low-K+ in Arabidopsis. In this research, AtCIPK23 was transformed into an E3 potato cultivar successfully. In low-K+ conditions, the transgenic potato lines had lower levels of leaf chlorosis, higher K+ uptake rate, increased dry weight and K+ content. The non-transgenic lines displayed reduced stature while the transgenic lines exhibited sustained growth. These results indicate that ectopic expression of AtCIPK23 increases low-K+ tolerance in potato. This study demonstrated the potential use of the transgenic approach to increase potato production in low-K+ fields. 3aArabidopsis 3aSolanum tuberosum 3achlorosis 3acrop yield 3acultivars 3agenetically modified organisms 3aleaves 3apotassium 3apotatoes 3aprotein kinases 3asoil1 aLi, Jia1 aZou, Xue1 aLu, Liming1 aLi, Liqin1 aNi, Su1 aLiu, Fan0 tAmerican journal of potato research.g2011 Apr., v. 88, no. 2 p.153-159dThe Associationx1099-209X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12230-010-9173-0Open Access3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03930naa a2200757 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153072000900171100002000180245007400200300001600274500002400290500001500314520154500329650001501874650002201889650001001911650002101921650001901942650001701961650001901978650001701997650000902014650001702023650002802040650002702068650001302095650001702108650001702125650001502142650002502157650002202182650003002204650002502234650001202259650004302271650004002314650008102354650000902435650001102444650003802455650000902493650002002502650005402522650005302576650004002629650002602669650004902695651002402744653002002768653004402788700002302832700002102855700002402876773010602900852000903006856007603015930003303091945002503124946001103149655001203160IND4384979120221122224820.0061105e200612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438497912DNAL7 a170835752pmid7 a10.1111/j.1365-3164.2006.00550.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL8321 aHillier, Andrew10aPyoderma caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection in dogs: 20 cases  ap. 432-439.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aIn this report we describe the historical, clinical, histopathological and microbiological features, as well as treatments and clinical outcome, of pyoderma where Pseudomonas aeruginosa alone was isolated on bacterial culture from lesional skin. Twenty dogs were included in this retrospective study. Seven dogs without prior history of systemic or skin disease presented with acute deep pseudomonal pyoderma characterized by a sudden onset of dorsal truncal pain. Skin lesions in these dogs consisted of erythematous papules, haemorrhagic bullae, ulcers and haemorrhagic crusts confined to the dorsum. An excellent clinical response was achieved with 3-4 weeks of treatment with oral fluoroquinolones. Thirteen dogs with a more gradual onset of skin lesions associated with pseudomonal pyoderma had a history of prior skin, ear or systemic disease and had previously been treated with antibiotics and/or immunomodulatory drugs. Skin lesions in these dogs were variable and similar to those described for superficial and deep staphylococcal pyoderma. In this group, one dog was euthanized prior to commencement of treatment, two dogs were lost to follow up, and 9 had resolution of lesions following treatment with topical silver sulfadiazine (one dog), fluoroquinolones (six dogs) or cephalexin (two dogs) administered orally for 3 to 12 weeks. Rod-shaped bacteria were not always detected on cytology. Histopathology of dogs with deep pseudomonal pyoderma was characterized by severe perforating suppurative folliculitis and furunculosis. 3acephalexin 3adisease detection 3atorso 3ain vitro culture 3ahistopathology 3askin lesions 3adisease course 3adog diseases 3adogs 3asulfadiazine 3apathogen identification 3aPseudomonas aeruginosa 3apyoderma 3acase studies 3acell biology 3aquinolones 3abacterial infections 3adisease diagnosis 2aAdministration, Cutaneous 2aAdministration, Oral 2aAnimals 2aAnti-Bacterial Agentsxtherapeutic use 2aCephalexinxadministration & dosage 2aDog Diseasesxdrug therapyxepidemiologyxetiologyxmicrobiologyxpathology. 2aDogs 2aFemale 2aFluoroquinolonesxtherapeutic use 2aMale 2aMedical Records 2aPseudomonas Infectionsxepidemiologyxveterinary. 2aPseudomonas aeruginosaxisolation & purification 2aPyodermaxepidemiologyxveterinary. 2aRetrospective Studies 2aSilver Sulfadiazinexadministration & dosage 0aOhioxepidemiology. 0afluroquinolones 0asigns and symptoms (animals and humans)1 aAlcorn, Jessica R.1 aCole, Lynette K.1 aKowalski, Joseph J.0 tVeterinary dermatology.g2006 Dec., v. 17, no. 6 p.432-439dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0959-44937nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-3164.2006.00550.x3electronic resource  a20070314b20070402c00000000  aINDd4CTe2007/02/16  aNon-US 7aarticle01570naa a2200265 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001900110245005200129300001400181500002400195520088200219650002201101650001301123650001201136650002501148650001601173650001301189650000901202773007201211852000901283655001201292IND4459680320221122212600.0110707s2011    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445968032DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHull, R.

So why isn't public attention riveted on forests? Why isn't Forestry's relevance increasing? The Journal is full of laments about Forestry being misunderstood by the public and misrepresented by media. This is a legitimate concern. However, a bigger problem exists: the declining political and economic power of Forestry's traditional patrons. Forestry is a service-oriented profession that emerged and evolved to meet the needs of powerful patrons; and several of these patrons—government agencies, forest industry, and commodity producing landowners—have declining power and influence. Forestry's future lies with new patrons: environmental nongovernment organizations, residential forest investors, and the working green infrastructure. Servicing these groups will require Forestry to develop new tools and tactics. 3aforest industries 3aforestry 3aforests 3agreen infrastructure 3aoccupations 3apolitics 3arisk0 tJournal of forestry.g2011 , v. 109, no. 1 p.50-56x0022-12017nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle03316naa a2200661 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153072000900171072000900180100002200189245005900211300001600270500002400286500001500310520148900325650002001814650001901834650001001853650001701863650001801880650001701898650000901915650000901924650001101933650001501944650002901959650002501988650002002013650001902033650001702052650002502069650001102094650001302105650004302118650001202161650002202173650000902195650001102204650000902215650001002224653002302234653002102257653002002278653002602298653003002324653002802354773010602382852000902488856007602497930003302573945002502606946001102631655001202642IND4384978720221122212551.0061105e200612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438497872DNAL7 a170835712pmid7 a10.1111/j.1365-3164.2006.00544.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL840 0aL6001 aMecklenburg, Lars13aAn overview on congenital alopecia in domestic animals  ap. 393-410.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aAlopecia, that is, lack of hair in any quantity, is a frequent complaint of pet owners. Although mostly acquired, rare congenital forms of alopecia exist that are associated with abnormalities in hair follicle morphogenesis. Congenital alopecias can result in changes in quality or quantity of hair follicles and the hair fibres produced by them. They vary in terms of clinical presentation and mode of inheritance. Histopathology is usually needed in order to differentiate between a reduced number of otherwise normal hair follicles and qualitative hair follicle abnormalities. Although our understanding of the molecular mechanisms that drive hair follicle morphogenesis in mice and humans has significantly increased during the last decade, still very little is known about congenital alopecias in domestic animals. Because of their rarity and the general lack of knowledge about their pathophysiology, classification of congenital alopecias in domestic animals is still unsatisfactory. This article reviews hair follicle morphogenesis and its most important molecular mechanisms, and it discusses the various forms of congenital alopecia occurring in domestic animals that have been described in the literature, differentiating between hair follicle aplasia, hair follicle dysplasia (i.e. defects associated with hair follicle development and defects associated with hair shaft formation), and neuroectodermal dysplasias, the latter involving the hair follicle pigmentary system. 3acattle diseases 3ahorse diseases 3ahairs 3apigmentation 3amorphogenesis 3adog diseases 3acats 3adogs 3acattle 3adog breeds 3acongenital abnormalities 3abiochemical pathways 3acell physiology 3ahair follicles 3acat diseases 3aabnormal development 3ahorses 3aalopecia 2aAlopeciaxphysiopathologyxveterinary. 2aAnimals 2aAnimals, Domestic 2aCats 2aCattle 2aDogs 2aSwine 0aliterature reviews 0adomestic animals 0aanimal diseases 0ahair follicle aplasia 0aneuroectodermal dysplasia 0ahair follicle dysplasia0 tVeterinary dermatology.g2006 Dec., v. 17, no. 6 p.393-410dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0959-44937nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-3164.2006.00544.x3electronic resource  a20070314b20070402c00000000  aINDd4CTe2007/02/16  aNon-US 7aarticle02479naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002700110245008500137300001400222500002400236520137300260650002901633650001201662650001501674650001201689650001401701650001301715650001201728650001301740650001301753650001701766650001701783650001301800650001901813650001601832651001101848651001001859651001801869651001301887651001201900700002101912700001901933773007201952852000902024655001202033IND4459680020221122184358.0110707s2011    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445968002DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAnderson, Nathaniel M.10aGeographic information system-based spatial analysis of sawmill wood procurement  ap. 34-42.  aIncludes references  aIn the sawmill sector of the forest products industry, the clustering of mills and wide variation in forest stocking and ownership result in sawlog markets that are complex and spatially differentiated. Despite the inherent spatial attributes of markets for stumpage and logs, few studies have used geospatial methods to examine wood procurement in detail across political boundaries. This article provides a visual representation of wood procurement pressure across the Northern Forest region of the northeastern United States based on a spatial analysis of woodshed maps provided by 273 sawmills in the United States and Canada. The analysis also includes the predicted woodsheds of 280 nonrespondent mills, which were modeled based on mill characteristics and location. In general, maps emphasize the magnitude of softwood procurement on industrial and investment-oriented forestlands in northern Maine, but also highlight distinct spatial procurement patterns in New York, Vermont, and New Hampshire. Sensitivity analyses of woodshed boundary uncertainty suggest that procurement pressure in existing hotspots will intensify if procurement range is restricted by high transportation costs. The methods used to visualize resource procurement in this study have the potential to benefit a broad range of stakeholders including industry, policymakers, and landowners. 3aforest products industry 3aforests 3alandowners 3amarkets 3aownership 3apolitics 3asawlogs 3asawmills 3asoftwood 3aspatial data 3astakeholders 3astumpage 3atransportation 3auncertainty 3aCanada 3aMaine 3aNew Hampshire 3aNew York 3aVermont1 aGermain, Rene H.1 aBevilacqua, E.0 tJournal of forestry.g2011 , v. 109, no. 1 p.34-42x0022-12017nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle03100naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127072000900145072000900154072000900163072000900172100001400181245017100195300001800366500028600384500002400670520135100694650002602045650001802071650002102089650002402110650001002134650002502144650002602169650001802195650002102213650001502234650001702249651001202266653002302278653002102301653003002322773010702352852000902459856006902468930003302537945002502570946001102595655001202606IND4384964020221122184436.0061105e200610  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438496402DNAL7 a10.1007/s10530-005-5851-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF900 0aM001 0aM500 0aP2001 aGu, Binhe10aEnvironmental conditions and phosphorus removal in Florida lakes and wetlands inhabited by Hydrilla verticillata (Royle): implications for invasive species management  ap. 1569-1578.  aIn the special issue: Beijing International Symposium on Biological Invasions / edited by S.

In south Florida, Hydrilla dominance has also been documented in treatment wetlands. This paper characterizes (1) environmental conditions which favor Hydrilla growth and (2) understand its nutrient removal capability. Despite its occurrence over a wide range of environmental conditions, Hydrilla abundance increased with increasing pH, alkalinity, total P and total N, and decreased with water depth in selected Florida lakes. No relationship was found between color, Secchi depth and Hydrilla abundance. In several Hydrilla-dominated lakes, mean total P concentration (126 μg/l) at inflow was reduced to 106 μg/l at outflow. The maximum inflow total P concentration in a lake with positive nutrient reduction was 148 μg/l. Total P removal efficiency by Hydrilla-dominated lakes and wetlands was comparable to or higher than systems dominated by emergent and other submerged plants. Mean total P settling rates for lakes and a constructed wetland dominated by Hydrilla were estimated at 19 and 34 m/year, respectively, which were higher than or comparable to similar systems dominated by other aquatic plants. Results from this study suggest that reduction of Hydrilla from constructed wetlands will not likely improve nutrient removal performance. 3aHydrilla verticillata 3aaquatic weeds 3ainvasive species 3aecological invasion 3alakes 3aconstructed wetlands 3aenvironmental factors 3awater quality 3anutrient content 3aphosphorus 3aweed control 3aFlorida 0atreatment wetlands 0anutrient removal 0ainvasive plant management0 tBiological invasions.g2006 Oct., v. 8, no. 7 p.1569-1578dKluwer Academic Publishersx1387-35477nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10530-005-5851-03electronic resource  a20061201b20070102c00000000  aINDdNZMe2006/12/01  aNon-US 7aarticle02390naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002800152245012100180300001600301500002400317520090900341650001901250650001501269650002101284650001101305650001801316650001501334650002401349650001201373650001601385650001501401650002601416650001001442650002101452650001701473650002101490650001801511700002201529773014401551852000901695856009201704856005501796930003301851945002501884946001101909655001201920IND4384966820221122160008.0061105e200612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438496682DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1744-7976.2006.00070.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGustavsen, Geir Wæhler11aAA Censored Quantile Regression Analysis of Vegetable Demand: The Effects of Changes in Prices and Total Expenditure  ap. 631-645.  aIncludes references  aMany diseases are linked to dietary behavior. One major diet-related risk factor is a low consumption of vegetables. The consumption may be increased through public policies. The effects on vegetable purchases of either removing the value added tax on vegetables or a general income support are investigated. Adverse health effects are most serious in households consuming low quantities of vegetables. Therefore, the effects on high- and low-consuming households are estimated by using quantile regressions (QRs). Since many households did not purchase any vegetable during each survey period, censored as well as ordinary QRs are used. Our results suggest that the effects of the policy variables differ in different parts of the conditional distribution of vegetable purchases. None of the proposed policy options is likely to substantially increase vegetable purchases among low-consuming households. 3ahuman behavior 3ahouseholds 3ahousehold income 3aprices 3apublic policy 3apurchasing 3aregression analysis 3asurveys 3avalue added 3avegetables 3adiet-related diseases 3ataxes 3afood consumption 3arisk factors 3anutrition policy 3aeating habits1 aRickertsen, Kyrre0 tCanadian journal of agricultural economics.g2006 Dec., v. 54, no. 4 p.631-645dBlackwell Publishing IncwJournal:jnl44931x0008-39767nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1744-7976.2006.00070.x3Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1744-7976.2006.00070.x  a20110311b20110402c00000000  aINDdTEMeYLP 2011/0  aNon-US 7aarticle02865naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002000152245010900172300001600281500002400297520158500321650002301906650001601929650001501945650001601960650001601976650001101992650001902003650001002022650002202032650002102054651001602075700002302091700002002114700002302134700002102157700002202178700002302200773011902223852000902342856009202351655001202443IND4459676720221122082944.0110707s2011    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445967672DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1654-1103.2011.01261.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSoomers, Hester10aFactors influencing the seed source and sink functions of a floodplain nature reserve in the Netherlands  ap. 445-456.  aIncludes references  aQuestion: How do species traits and abiotic factors influence the extent of hydrochorous dispersal into and out of a small floodplain area along a free-flowing river in The Netherlands? Location: The Kappersbult nature reserve (53degrees 07'28"N, 6degrees 37'14"E), which is a floodplain along the Dutch River Drentsche Aa. Methods: Seeds transported by the river were collected in fine mesh nets for 24 consecutive hours once or twice a week for 1 year, upstream and downstream of the studied floodplain. Data on the captured seeds were related to species traits and abiotic factors and species composition in the floodplain. Results: The floodplain functioned both as a seed source and sink. High levels of river water seemed to promote seed transport to or from the floodplain. Seeds of riverbank species occurred significantly more often in the river water than expected. Net source species had significantly higher seed production, taller stature and higher seed buoyancy, but lower site elevation than net sink species. Seed weight was significantly higher for sink species than for other species. Conclusion: Our study found that inundation, and therefore more natural river water management, is a prerequisite for seed transport to and from a floodplain. The restoration of target floodplain vegetation may be successful for common species that produce many seeds and grow in proximity to the river. Consequently, it is expected that the probability of restoring vegetation types that occur further from the river, such as wet grasslands, by hydrochorous dispersal is low. 3aconservation areas 3afloodplains 3agrasslands 3aprobability 3ariver water 3arivers 3aseed dispersal 3aseeds 3aspecies diversity 3awater management 3aNetherlands1 aSarneel, Judith M.1 aPatberg, Wouter1 aVerbeek, Steven K.1 aVerweij, Pita A.1 aWassen, Martin J.1 aDiggelen, Rudy Van0 tJournal of vegetation science.g2011 June, v. 22, no. 3 p.445-456dOpulus PresswJournal:jnl46820x1100-92337nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1654-1103.2011.01261.x3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03394naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004100111040001800152072000900170100001700179245007900196300001800275500002400293500001500317520190900332650001902241650001702260650001902277650001202296650002402308650002202332650001902354650003502373650004002408650003602448650003202484650003302516650002602549650003702575653001702612653001802629653000902647773009102656852000902747856007502756930003302831945002502864946001102889655001202900IND4384902320221122082954.0061102e200606  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438490232DNAL7 a167163692pmid7 a10.1016/j.phytochem.2006.03.0232doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF6001 aDunphy, P.J.10aLocation and biosynthesis of monoterpenyl fatty acyl esters in rose petals  ap. 1110-1119.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThe upper epidermal layer of cells and the epicuticular wax surface of Lady Seton rose petals are sites of biosynthesis and accumulation, respectively, of a family of terpenyl fatty acyl esters. These esters are based mainly on the acyclic monoterpene alcohol geraniol coupled primarily to fatty acids of chain lengths 16-20 and in mass terms represent from 14% to 64% of the total monoterpenes present in the petals. The lipophilic nature of these non-volatile esters of the monoterpene alcohols contrasts with that of the lipophilic volatile parent alcohols themselves and with the hydrophilic, non-volatile, glucoside derivative of the other principal petal fragrant compounds, the phenylpropanoids, β-phenyl ethanol and benzyl alcohol. These latter compounds are also synthesised and are resident in the petal. Biosynthetic studies confirmed that the petal upper epidermal cell layer has the capacity to incorporate mevalonic acid into the monoterpene component of the fatty acyl ester. The biosynthesis of the monoterpene component of the fatty acyl ester occurs via the mevalonic acid pathway in Lady Seton as well as in the hybrid tea rose Fragrant Cloud. In the latter flower the biosynthesis of geraniol was biosynthetically trans as was the formation of nerol and citronellol. Both geraniol and nerol were shown to be precursors of citronellol via an NADPH dependent reductase reaction. Oleic acid is assimilated into the acyl moiety of the terpenyl ester in Lady Seton isolated petal discs. It is probable that the lipophilic non-volatile terpenyl fatty acyl esters represent a stable storage form of the corresponding alcohols from their residency within the epicuticular wax layer. These acyl esters may realise, on hydrolysis, additional aroma notes from the living flower and potentially commercially significant quantities of the fragrant terpenols during oil of rose essence production. 3aRosa damascena 3abiosynthesis 3amonoterpenoids 3acorolla 3atissue distribution 3afatty acid esters 3aRosa chinensis 2aEstersxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aFatty Acidsxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aFlowersxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aPlant Epidermisxmetabolism 2aRosaxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aSubstrate Specificity 2aTerpenesxchemistryxmetabolism. 0aRosa odorata 0aRosa gigantea 0aRosa0 tPhytochemistry.g2006 June, v. 67, no. 11 p.1110-1119dPergamon Pressx0031-94227nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.phytochem.2006.03.0233electronic resource  a20061113b20061202c00000000  aINDdRSCe2006/11/13  aNon-US 7aarticle02056naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001400128245015600142300001400298500002300312520048700335650001400822650001000836650002300846650001400869650001700883650001300900650001300913650001800926650002400944650004300968650001101011650002701022650002801049650002401077650005001101650002101151650002601172650005801198650002201256653001201278700002101290700001901311700001701330700002101347700001501368773009001383852000901473939003301482946001101515655001201526IND9202830520221122064643.0920507e199101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920283052DNAL7 a20396082pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRolka, K.10aChemical synthesis of new trypsin, chymotrypsin and elastase inhibitors by amino-acid substitutions in a trypsin inhibitor from squash seeds (CMTI III)  ap. 63-68.  aSummary in German.  aFive new analogues of squash trypsin inhibitor CMTI III were obtained by the solid-phase method, exhibiting antitrypsin, antichymotrypsin or antielastase activity.

In the current study, our goal was to evaluate acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitory and antioxidant activities of the ethyl acetate, methanol, and water extracts prepared from the branches, leaves, and fruits of Viburnum opulus and Viburnum lantana along with salicin, amentoflavone, and chlorogenic acid, three major compounds abundantly found in these species. AChE enzyme inhibition was tested in vitro using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay microplate reader at 50, 100, and 200 microliter/mL concentrations. Antioxidant activity was examined by ferrous ion chelating capacity, ferric reducing antioxidant power, and beta-carotene bleaching assay at 500, 1,000, and 2,000 micrograms/mL. Total phenol and flavonoid contents of the extracts were also established by Folin-Ciocalteau and AlCl3 reagents, respectively. Our data revealed that the leaf methanol extract of V. opulus displayed a significantly high inhibitory effect against AChE (57.63 +/- 1.23%, 87.41 +/- 0.99%, and 93.19 +/- 0.87% at 50, 100, and 200 micrograms/mL, respectively). The extracts of V. lantana exerted higher antioxidant activity. 3aViburnum lantana 3aViburnum opulus 3aacetylcholinesterase 3aantioxidant activity 3aantioxidants 3abeta-carotene 3ableaching 3abranches 3achlorogenic acid 3aenzyme inhibition 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3aethyl acetate 3aflavonoids 3afruits 3aleaves 3amethanol 3aphenol 2aAntioxidantsxpharmacology 2aBenzyl Alcoholsxanalysis 2aBiflavonoidsxanalysis 2aChlorogenic Acidxanalysis 2aCholinesterase Inhibitorsxpharmacology 2aEnzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay 2aGlucosidesxanalysis 2aPhenolsxanalysis 2aPlant Extractsxpharmacology 2aPlant Leavesxchemistry 2aViburnumxchemistry 2abeta Carotenexmetabolism 3aTurkey (country)1 aAltun, Mehmet Levent1 aSever-Yilmaz, Betül1 aSaltan, Gülçin0 tJournal of medicinal food.g2011 Apr., v. 14, no. 4 p.434-440dMary Ann Liebert, Incx1096-620X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1089/jmf.2010.00533Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02021naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001800145245011400163300001400277500002400291500001500315520101800330650002201348650001501370650001201385650001201397650001501409650001201424653001101436700002001447700002001467700001901487773010801506852000901614856004801623655001201671IND4385515220221122031752.0061126e200609  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438551522DNAL7 a10.1007/s10725-006-9128-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Hui-Min10aExtracellular calcium is involved in stomatal movement through the regulation of water channels in broad bean  ap. 79-83.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-05  aInvolvement of extracellular Ca²⁺ in stomatal movement through the regulation of water channels was investigated in broad bean (Vicia faba L.). Leaf peels were first incubated to open stomata, and then transferred to buffers in the presence of different CaCl₂ concentrations. Stomatal status was observed under magnification and stomatal aperture (pore width/length) was measured. Stomatal closure was significantly induced and aperture oscillation occurred at lower extracellular concentrations of calcium ([Ca²⁺]ext), while at higher concentrations, no significant change in stomatal aperture was observed, which was similar to the response recorded with HgCl₂. Lower [Ca²⁺]ext-induced stomatal closure could be reversed using depolarizing buffer. It is suggested that lower [Ca²⁺]ext regulates water channels through an indirect way and at higher concentrations, extracellular Ca²⁺ is involved in regulating stomatal aperture by directly influencing water channels to retard aperture change. 3astomatal movement 3aVicia faba 3abuffers 3acalcium 3afaba beans 3astomata 0aleaves1 aZhang, Xiao-Yan1 aTang, Qing-Long1 aWang, Gen-Xuan0 tPlant growth regulation.g2006 Sept., v. 50, no. 1 p.79-83dKluwer Academic Publishersx0167-69037nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10725-006-9128-0 7aarticle02482naa a2200637 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153072000900171072000900180100003000189245008000219300001600299500002400315500001500339520056700354650001200921650002800933650001900961650002200980650002001002650001901022650001701041650001701058650002301075650000901098650001701107650001701124650001601141650001501157650001901172650001401191650002201205650001201227650000901239650006001248650002801308650004001336650000901376650001101385650005701396653002401453653004401477700002201521700002901543773010601572852000901678856007601687930003301763945002501796946001101821655001201832IND4384979520221122031550.0061105e200612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438497952DNAL7 a170835792pmid7 a10.1111/j.1365-3164.2006.00555.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL821 0aX3801 aConceição, Lissandro G.10aPustular dermatosis caused by fire ant (Solenopsis invicta) stings in a dog  ap. 453-455.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThis paper reports a case of spontaneous fire ant sting dermatitis in canine.

An extensive area of collagen degeneration was also observed below the epidermal pustule. These clinical and histopathological findings are remarkable similar to those observed in fire ant stings in humans. 3aabdomen 3ainsect bites and stings 3ahuman diseases 3adisease detection 3aanimal injuries 3adisease course 3askin lesions 3adog diseases 3aSolenopsis invicta 3adogs 3ainflammation 3acase studies 3aeosinophils 3adermatitis 3ahistopathology 3afire ants 3adisease diagnosis 2aAnimals 2aAnts 2aBites and Stingsxcomplicationsxdiagnosisxveterinary. 2aDiagnosis, Differential 2aDog Diseasesxdiagnosisxpathology. 2aDogs 2aFemale 2aSkin Diseasesxcomplicationsxdiagnosisxveterinary. 0apustular dermatosis 0asigns and symptoms (animals and humans)1 aHaddad, Vidal Jr.1 aLoures, Fabricia Hallack0 tVeterinary dermatology.g2006 Dec., v. 17, no. 6 p.453-455dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0959-44937nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-3164.2006.00555.x3electronic resource  a20070314b20070402c00000000  aINDd4CTe2007/02/16  aNon-US 7aarticle02640naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002200164245012600186300001200312500002400324520146700348650001701815650002901832650001601861650001301877650004701890650001601937650005001953650001102003650003602014700002502050700001902075700002002094773009502114852000902209856004802218655001202266IND4432480620221122005013.0100205e201001  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443248062DNAL7 a199673652pmid7 a10.1007/s00267-009-9383-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMargles, Shawn W.10aConservation Without Borders: Building Communication and Action Across Disciplinary Boundaries for Effective Conservation  ap. 1-4.  aIncludes references  aInterdisciplinary approaches to conservation research and environmental management continue to garner interest among practitioners, academics, and students. Yet, cases of practitioners and researchers from different disciplines successfully working in concert towards an integrated conservation approach are rare. What is preventing practitioners of multiple disciplines from harmoniously working together? Why are practitioners and academics struggling to apply their graduate training to real world conservation? What is preventing the benefits of cooperation and partnerships between different disciplines addressing conservation from being realized? This special issue “Conservation without Borders: Building Communication and Action across Disciplinary Boundaries for Effective Conservation” asks readers to consider the numerous interpretations and implications of the phrase “Conservation without Borders” and to reflect on how different academic and disciplinary lenses can contribute to a more integrated approach to tackling conservation challenges. The articles that comprise this special issue offer readers insights into the ways in which different disciplines view conservation work and interdisciplinary approaches to environmental problems. Bringing these perspectives and approaches together in one place is a step towards improving communication across disciplines for the purpose of achieving more successful biodiversity conservation. 3abiodiversity 3aenvironmental management 3aresearchers 3astudents 2aConservation of Natural Resourcesxmethods 2aEnvironment 2aEnvironmental Pollutionxprevention & control 2aHumans 2aInterdisciplinary Communication1 aPeterson, Richard B.1 aErvin, Jamison1 aKaplin, Beth A.0 tEnvironmental management.g2010 Jan., v. 45, no. 1 p.1-4dSpringer-Verlagx0364-152X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00267-009-9383-8 7aarticle02142naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001800145245009600163300001600259520075600275650001401031650001701045650001701062650002401079650000901103650001901112650002701131650001601158650001401174650004801188650001301236650002501249650003601274700001401310700001801324700001601342700001701358700001401375700001501389700001701404773011301421852000901534856008501543930003301628946001101661655001201672IND4418089320221121223922.0090320e200904  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441808932DNAL7 a10.1007/s00726-008-0133-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTarantino, U.10aFXIIIA and TGF-β over-expression produces normal musculo-skeletal phenotype in TG2-/- mice  ap. 679-684.  aTransglutaminase (TGs) enzymes and proteins crosslinking have for long time been implicated in the formation of hard tissue development, matrix maturation and mineralization.

Here, we analyse the morphological consequences of TG2 deficiency, during the development of skeletal elements. When TG2 is absent, there are not gross abnormalities in the development of the skeletal system, probably from compensatory mechanisms resulting in increased expression of FXIIIA and TGF-ß 1.

Among such crops, pearl millet is one of the most important staple species. In Niger, pearl millet covers more than 65% of the total cultivated area. Analyzing pearl millet genetic diversity, its origin and its dynamics is important for in situ and ex situ germplasm conservation and to increase knowledge useful for breeding programs. We developed new genetic markers and a high-throughput technique for the genetic analysis of pearl millet. Using 25 microsatellite markers, we analyzed genetic diversity in 46 wild and 421 cultivated accessions of pearl millet in Niger. We showed a significantly lower number of alleles and lower gene diversity in cultivated pearl millet accessions than in wild accessions. This result contrasts with a previous study using iso-enzyme markers showing similar genetic diversity between cultivated and wild pearl millet populations. We found a strong differentiation between the cultivated and wild groups in Niger. Analyses of introgressions between cultivated and wild accessions showed modest but statistically supported evidence of introgressions. Wild accessions in the central region of Niger showed introgressions of cultivated alleles. Accessions of cultivated pearl millet showed introgressions of wild alleles in the western, central, and eastern parts of Niger. 3aPennisetum glaucum 3aalleles 3acrops 3agenetic markers 3agenetic variation 3agermplasm conservation 3aintrogression 3amicrosatellite repeats 2aAlleles 2aCrops, Agriculturalxgenetics 2aGenetic Variation 2aGeography 2aMicrosatellite Repeats 2aPennisetumxgenetics 3aNiger 0aNiger1 aLuong, Viviane1 aKapran, Issoufou1 aMamadou, Aïssata1 aSagnard, Fabrice1 aDeu, Monique1 aChantereau, J.q(Jacques)1 aGérard, Bruno.1 aNdjeunga, Jupiter1 aBezançon, Gilles.1 aPham, Jean-Louis1 aVigouroux, Yves0 tTheoretical and applied genetics.g2006 Dec., v. 114, no. 1 p.49-58dSpringer-Verlagx0040-57527nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00122-006-0409-9 7aarticle02361naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001700146245014000163300001800303520101200321650002301333650000901356650001101365650001601376650002601392650001201418650001201430650002901442650003101471650000901502650001301511650001201524650001001536700001301546700001301559700001901572700001701591700001801608700001301626700001901639700001301658773017601671856004701847852000901894655001201903IND60579802120221121165044.0170901e20170705xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057980212DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jafc.7b019902doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Da-Wei10aSynthesis and Herbicidal Activity of Pyrido[2,3-d]pyrimidine-2,4-dione–Benzoxazinone Hybrids as Protoporphyrinogen Oxidase Inhibitors  ap. 5278-5286.  aTo search for new protoporphyrinogen oxidase (PPO, EC 1.3.3.4) inhibitors with improved bioactivity, a series of novel pyrido[2,3-d]pyrimidine-2,4-dione–benzoxazinone hybrids, 9–13, were designed and synthesized.

Compound 11q displayed a strong and broad spectrum of weed control at 37.5–150 g of active ingredient (ai)/ha by both post- and pre-emergence application, which was comparable to that of flumioxazin. 11q was safe to maize, soybean, peanut, and cotton at 150 g ai/ha, and selective to rice and wheat at 75 g ai/ha by pre-emergence application, indicating potential applicability in these fields. 3aactive ingredients 3acorn 3acotton 3aflumioxazin 3aherbicidal properties 3ahybrids 3apeanuts 3apreemergent weed control 3aprotoporphyrinogen oxidase 3arice 3asoybeans 3atobacco 3awheat1 aLi, Qian1 aWen, Kai1 aIsmail, Ismail1 aLiu, Dan-Dan1 aNiu, Cong-Wei1 aWen, Xin1 aYang, Guang-Fu1 aXi, Zhen0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2017 July 5, v. 65, no. 26 p.5278-5286dAmerican Chemical Society, Books and Journals DivisionwJournal:12177x0021-85617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jafc.7b01990  aDNAL 7aarticle02848naa a2200637 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111072001700129100001700146245007100163300001600234500001500250520111700265650001401382650001301396650003501409650002501444650002301469650001001492650001001502650002501512650002301537650001101560650001001571650001201581650001801593650002301611650002101634650001601655650002001671650002201691650000901713650002101722650001101743650003701754650002801791650002701819650004601846650002701892650002201919653001601941653001301957653002801970700001401998700001702012700001802029773007302047852000902120930003302129945002502162946001102187655001202198IND4375568320221121132756.0051027e200510  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437556832DNAL7 a161679812pmid  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aPielberg, G.10aComparative linkage mapping of the Grey coat colour gene in horses  ap. 390-395.  a2019-12-05  aGrey horses are born coloured, turn progressively grey and often develop melanomas late in life. Grey shows an autosomal dominant inheritance and the locus has previously been mapped to horse chromosome 25 (ECA25), around the TXN gene. We have now developed eight new single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with genes on ECA25 using information on the linear order of genes on human chromosome 9q, as well as the human and mouse coding sequences. These SNPs were mapped in relation to the Grey locus using more than 300 progeny from matings between two Swedish Warmblood grey stallions and non-grey mares. Grey was firmly assigned to an interval with flanking markers NANS and ABCA1. This corresponds to a region of approximately 6.9 Mb on human chromosome 9q. Furthermore, no recombination was observed between Grey, TGFBR1 and TMEFF1, the last two being 1.4 Mb apart in human. There are no obvious candidate genes in this region and none of the genes has been associated with pigmentation disorders or melanoma development, suggesting that the grey phenotype is caused by a mutation in a novel gene. 3aautosomes 3amelanoma 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism 3adominance (genetics) 3achromosome mapping 3agenes 3acolor 3anucleotide sequences 3alinkage (genetics) 3ahorses 3ahairs 2aAnimals 2aBase Sequence 2aChromosome Mapping 2aCrosses, Genetic 2aDNA Primers 2aGenesxgenetics 2aGenomicsxmethods 2aHair 2aHorsesxgenetics 2aHumans 2aMicrosatellite Repeatsxgenetics 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPigmentationxgenetics 2aPolymorphism, Single Nucleotidexgenetics 2aSequence Analysis, DNA 2aSyntenyxgenetics 0achromosomes 0amutation 0amolecular sequence data1 aMikko, S.1 aSandberg, K.1 aAndersson, L.0 tAnimal genetics.g2005 Oct., v. 36, no. 5 p.390-395x0268-91467nnas  aDNAL  a20080321b20080404c00000000  aINDd2CTe2006/01/05  aNon-US 7aarticle03708naa a2200685 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146072001700164072001700181100001900198245011100217300001600328500001500344520169200359650001802051650001802069650001902087650001302106650003902119650002102158650001102179650002002190650001702210650001902227650001802246650001302264650001702277650000702294650001502301650003102316650001302347650001202360650002102372650004102393650002702434650002702461650002902488650003102517650001402548650002502562650002002587650001802607653001702625653002102642653002302663653003902686700001702725700002202742773008302764852000902847856008502856930003302941945002502974946001102999655001203010IND4375222320221121132757.0051014e200508  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437522232DNAL7 a161743662pmid7 a10.1017/S00220299050010442doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aO'Mahony, J.A.14aThe manufacture of miniature Cheddar-type cheeses from milks with different fat globule size distributions  ap. 338-348.  a2019-12-04  aA novel 2-stage gravity separation scheme was developed for fractionation of raw, whole bovine milk into fractions enriched in small (SFG) or large (LFG) fat globules. The volume mean diameter of fat globules in SFG, LFG or control (CTRL) milk was 3.45, 4.68 and 3.58 micrometer, respectively. The maximum in storage modulus (index of firmness) decreased with increasing fat globule size for rennet-induced gels formed from SFG, LFG or CTRL milks. Miniature (20 g) Cheddar cheeses were manufactured using each of the 3 milks. There were no significant (P > 0.05) differences in the pH, moisture and fat in dry matter levels between cheeses made using any of the 3 milks, however, the fat content of the cheese made using SFG milk was approximately 1% lower than that of cheese made using LFG or CTRL milk in each of the 2 trials. Image analysis of confocal scanning laser micrographs of the cheeses illustrated that the star volume of fat globules in the cheeses decreased significantly (P less than or equal to 0.05) as the size of fat globules in the milks used for cheesemaking was reduced. This indicates that it is possible to manipulate the size distribution of fat globules in Cheddar cheese by adjusting the fat globule size distribution of the milk used for cheesemaking. The concentration of free fatty acids (FFA) increased in all cheeses during ripening. At 120 d of ripening, the concentration of FFA varied significantly (P less than or equal to 0.05 and P less than or equal to 0.001 for trials 1 and 2, respectively) with fat globule size, with cheeses made in trial 2 from LFG, SFG or CTRL milks having total FFA levels of 3391, 2820 and 2612 mg/kg cheese, respectively. 3alipid content 3afractionation 3aimage analysis 3araw milk 3aconfocal laser scanning microscopy 3afree fatty acids 3arennet 3acheese ripening 3afood quality 3aCheddar cheese 3awater content 3amilk fat 3afat globules 3apH 3aseparation 3aparticle size distribution 3agelation 2aAnimals 2aCheesexanalysis 2aFatty Acids, Nonesterifiedxanalysis 2aFood Handlingxmethods 2aGlycolipidsxchemistry 2aGlycoproteinsxchemistry 2aHydrogen-Ion Concentration 2aLipolysis 2aMicroscopy, Confocal 2aMilkxchemistry 2aParticle Size 0acheesemaking 0amilk composition 0agravity separation 0aconfocal scanning laser microscopy1 aAuty, M.A.E.1 aMcSweeney, P.L.H.0 tJournal of dairy research.g2005 Aug., v. 72, no. 3 p.338-348x0022-02997nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S00220299050010443Available from publisher's Web site  a20080422b20080502c00000000  aINDd4CTe2005/12/22  aNon-US 7aarticle01775naa a2200337 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100002500115245004800140300001600188300003000204500001500234520081000249650002101059650002301080653002601103653002101129653002301150653002901173653002701202653001701229653002601246773009001272852000901362939003301371945000801404946001301412655001201425991614791280742620221121074934.0810611e198012  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI810012312DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMoskowitz, Howard R.10aPsychometric evaluation of food preferences  ap. 149-167.  ap. 149-167. ill., charts.  a2019-12-05  aFood preferences are individualistic, influenced socially, psychologically, and physically, and tend to change with time, making food preference evaluations a complex subject. The traditional measurement is the 9 Point Hedonic Scale, varying from "Like Extremely" to "Dislike Extremely". Panelists usually avoid these extremes, however, and pick the middle range. This rating method is only part of food acceptability. A more comprehensive picture should also consider the Food Action Scale ("Eat Every Opportunity", "Eat if Forced", etc.), the Magnitude Estimation scale (ratio or comparison scaling), frequency scales, time-preference analysis, and food combination analysis. Also of interest is whether people actually eat what they say they prefer and how much impact acculturation has on food habits. 3aresearch methods 3afood acceptability 0aPsychological aspects 0aCultural factors 0aevaluation methods 0aFood preference measures 0aIndividual differences 0afood choices 0aFood acceptance tests0 tJournal of food service systems.g1980 Winter, v. 1, no. 2 p.149-167x0196-42837nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19810611c00000000  aFNC  aOther US 7aarticle01621naa a2200481 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024001800097040001800115100001800133245011600151300001400267520020700281650002000488650002300508650001300531650001600544650001600560650001200576650002800588650001100616650003400627650001600661650003600677650003100713650004700744650002500791650001600816650003100832653002400863653002000887653002400907700001500931700001600946700001600962773008800978852000901066939003301075945000801108946001101116655001201127991614790220742620221121055905.0830307e198204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aPAR830021132DNAL7 a68061002pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFawcett, D.W.14aThe entry of sporozoites of Theileria parva into bovine lymphocytes in vitro.

The cell-adhesive property of TG2 has been linked to a complex formation with FN and to its ability to crosslink and polymerize FN on the cell surface. We tested here the effects of extracellular FN, before and after in vitro crosslinking and polymerization by TG2, on MC3T3-E1 osteoblast adhesion. We show that TG2-mediated crosslinking creates large, compacted chain-like protein clusters that include both TG2 and FN molecules as analyzed by Western blotting and atomic force microscopy. Crosslinking of FN significantly promotes osteoblast adhesion as measured by crystal violet staining, and enhances β₁-integrin clustering on the cell surface as visualized by immunofluorescence microscopy. We hypothesize that TG2-mediated crosslinking enhances the cell-adhesive properties of FN by increasing the molecular rigidity of FN in the extracellular matrix. 3aCD29 antigen 3aWestern blotting 3aadhesion 3aatomic force microscopy 3acell adhesion 3acrosslinking 3aextracellular matrix 3afibronectins 3afluorescence microscopy 3agentian violet 3aosteoblasts 3apolymerization 3aprotein-glutamine gamma-glutamyltransferase1 aWang, Z. 1 aNelea, V. 1 aKaartinen, M.

In this study, a DNA microarray based on the O-antigen-specific genes of all 8 E. coli serogroups, as well as 11 genes encoding adhesion factors and exotoxins associated with PWD and ED, was developed for the identification of related serogroups and virulence gene patterns. The microarray method was tested against 186 E. coli and Shigella O-serogroup reference strains, 13 E. coli reference strains for virulence markers, 43 E. coli clinical isolates, and 12 strains of other bacterial species and shown to be highly specific with reproducible results. The detection sensitivity was 0.1 ng of genomic DNA or 10³ CFU per 0.3 g of porcine feces in mock samples. Seventeen porcine feces samples from local hoggeries were examined using the microarray, and the result for one sample was verified by the conventional serotyping methods. This microarray can be readily used to screen for the presence of PWD- and ED-associated E. coli in porcine feces samples.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDNA 3aEscherichia coli 3aShigella 3aadhesion 3adiarrhea 3aedema 3aexotoxins 3afeces 3agenes 3amicroarray technology 3aswine 3avirulence1 aLiu, Bin1 aCao, Boyang1 aBeutin, Lothar1 aKrüger, Ulrike1 aLiu, Hongbo1 aLi, Yayue1 aLiu, Yanqun1 aFeng, Lu1 aWang, Lei0 tApplied and environmental microbiology.g2007 June 15, v. 73, no. 12 p.4082-4088dAmerican Society for Microbiologyx0099-22407nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1128/AEM.01820-063Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://aem.asm.org/contents-by-date.0.shtml 7aarticle02317naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092024002200127024001900149040001800168100002400186245007100210300001600281506007600297520099800373506003701371650002501408650001701433650001501450650001001465650001801475650001101493650004801504700002701552700001701579700002501596700002001621700002101641773009501662852000901757856008501766930003301851946001101884655001201895IND4418090120221207130721.0090320e200904  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441809012DNAL7 a10.1007/s00726-008-0123-92doi7 aPMC31248502pmcid7 a186127772pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEckert, Richard L. 10aTIG3: a regulator of type I transglutaminase activity in epidermis  ap. 739-746.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aKeratinocytes undergo a process of terminal cell differentiation that results in the construction of a multilayered epithelium designed to produce a structure that functions to protect the body from dehydration, abrasion and infection. These protective properties are due to the production of a crosslinked layer of protein called the cornified envelope. Type I transglutaminase (TG1), an enzyme that catalyzes the formation of ε-(γ-glutamyl)lysine bonds, is the key protein responsible for generation of the crosslinks. The mechanisms that lead to activation of transglutaminase during terminal differentiation are not well understood. We have identified a protein that interacts with TG1 and regulates its activity. This protein, tazarotene-induced gene 3 (TIG3), is expressed in the differentiated layers of the epidermis and its expression is associated with transglutaminase activation and cornified envelope formation. We describe a novel mechanism whereby TIG3 regulates TG1 activity.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3acell differentiation 3acrosslinking 3aepithelium 3agenes 3akeratinocytes 3alysine 3aprotein-glutamine gamma-glutamyltransferase1 aSturniolo, Michael T. 1 aJans, Ralph 1 aKraft, Catherine A. 1 aJiang, Haibing 1 aRorke, Ellen A. 0 tAmino acids.g2009 Apr., v. 36, no. 4 p.739-746dVienna : Springer Viennax0939-44517nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00726-008-0123-93Available from publisher's Web site  a20090320b20090508c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle01632naa a2200469 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024001800097040001800115100003300133245005700166300001600223520029500239650001800534650001300552650001200565650002500577650003500602650002900637650002400666650002200690650003300712650002800745651001000773651001000783653003000793653004000823653002500863653002200888653002100910700001700931700001800948700001600966700001800982773008901000852000901089939003301098945000801131946001101139655001201150991614787710742620221121024548.0830304e198109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aPAR830020852DNAL7 a73234702pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLewis, Darrellq(Darrell J.)10aInvestigations on Babesia motasi isolated from Wales  ap. 239-243.  aBabesia motasi (Wales), infectivity for intact and splenectomized sheep and splenectomized goat, morphology, morphometric and serological comparison to strains of different geographic origins, transovarial transmission by Haemaphysalis punctata, limited serological survey of sheep in Wales 3apathogenicity 3aimmunity 2aAnimals 2aAntibodiesxanalysis 2aBabesiaxcytologyximmunology. 2aBabesiosisxparasitology 2aGoatsxparasitology 2aSheepximmunology 2aSheep Diseasesxparasitology 2aSplenectomyxveterinary 3aWales 0aWales 0aBabesia motasi (Protozoa) 0aHaemaphysalis punctata (Arthropoda) 0aMorphology, Protozoa 0aStrains, Protozoa 0aVectors, Acarina1 aHolman, M.R.1 aPurnell, R.E.1 aYoung, E.R.1 aHerbert, I.V.0 tResearch in veterinary science.g1981 Sept., v. 31, no. 2 p.239-243x0034-52887nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19830304c00000000  aPAR  aNon-US 7aarticle03314naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003000092024002200122024001900144040001800163100002000181245010100201300001800302500002400320500001500344506007600359520181500435506003702250650001602287650001702303650002502320650001002345650001802355650001202373650001102385650002302396650001602419650002502435650001302460650001502473650001202488650002102500653001802521700002102539700001402560700002002574773013702594852000902731856008002740655001202820IND4445989020221207130714.0101203e20101215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444598902DNAL7 a10.1128/AEM.00908-102doi7 aPMC30082452pmcid7 a209351182pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShin, Hyun-Dong10aEscherichia coli Binary Culture Engineered for Direct Fermentation of Hemicellulose to a Biofuel  ap. 8150-8159.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-05  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aMetabolic engineering has created several Escherichia coli biocatalysts for production of biofuels and other useful molecules. However, the inability of these biocatalysts to directly use polymeric substrates necessitates costly pretreatment and enzymatic hydrolysis prior to fermentation. Consolidated bioprocessing has the potential to simplify the process by combining enzyme production, hydrolysis, and fermentation into a single step but requires a fermenting organism to multitask by producing both necessary enzymes and target molecules. We demonstrate here a binary strategy for consolidated bioprocessing of xylan, a complex substrate requiring six hemicellulases for complete hydrolysis. An integrated modular approach was used to design the two strains to function cooperatively in the process of transforming xylan into ethanol. The first strain was engineered to coexpress two hemicellulases. Recombinant enzymes were secreted to the growth medium by a method of lpp deletion with over 90% efficiency. Secreted enzymes hydrolyzed xylan into xylooligosaccharides, which were taken in by the second strain, designed to use the xylooligosaccharides for ethanol production. Cocultivation of the two strains converted xylan hemicellulose to ethanol with a yield about 55% of the theoretical value. Inclusion of other three hemicellulases improved the ethanol yield to 70%. Analysis of the culture broth showed that xylooligosaccharides with four or more xylose units were not utilized, suggesting that improving the use of higher xyloogligomers should be the focus in future efforts. This is the first demonstration of an engineered binary culture for consolidated bioprocessing of xylan. The modular design should allow the strategy to be adopted for a broad range of biofuel and biorefinery products.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aengineering 3afermentation 3axylooligosaccharides 3axylan 3abioprocessing 3aenzymes 3axylose 3aethanol production 3abiorefining 3aenzymatic hydrolysis 3abiofuels 3ahydrolysis 3aethanol 3aEscherichia coli 0ahemicellulose1 aMcClendon, Shara1 aVo, Trinh1 aChen, Rachel R.0 tApplied and environmental microbiology.g2010 Dec. 15, v. 76, no. 24 p.8150-8159dAmerican Society for Microbiologyx0099-22407nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1128/AEM.00908-103Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle01543naa a2200469 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024001800097040001800115100001900133245016100152300001200313500001500325520013900340650002400479650001900503650001700522650001200539650001100551650001700562650002900579650002400608650000900632650000900641650001500650650002300665650004600688650003300734650004600767650001700813653001300830653004000843700002200883700001700905773007800922852000901000939003301009945000801042946001101050655001201061991614786960742620221121024448.0830304e198203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aPAR830020652DNAL7 a70691802pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPedersen, E.M.10aReduction in the severity of hepatosplenic schistosomiasis mansoni in mice by previous exposure to cercariae of the bird schistosome Trichobilharzia szidati  ap. 1-3.  a2019-12-04  aSchistosoma mansoni, mice, reduction in severity of hepatosplenic disease by previous exposure to cercariae of Trichobilharzia szidati 3aSchistosoma mansoni 3across reaction 3aimmunization 2aAnimals 2aFemale 2aHepatomegaly 2aIntestinesxparasitology 2aLiverxparasitology 2aMale 2aMice 2aOrgan Size 2aParasite Egg Count 2aSchistosoma mansonixgrowth & development 2aSchistosomatidaexphysiology 2aSchistosomiasisxparasitologyxpathology. 2aSplenomegaly 0aimmunity 0aTrichobilharzia szidati (Trematoda)1 aChristensen, N.O.1 aFrandsen, F.0 tJournal of helminthology.g1982 Mar., v. 56, no. 1 p.1-3x0022-149X7nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19830304c00000000  aPAR  aNon-US 7aarticle02473naa a2200289 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001800152245009800170300001600268520151500284650001401799653002201813653002201835653002501857653001101882700001501893773011601908852000902024856009202033930003302125946001302158655001202171IND4425788020221121024628.0090911e200910  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442578802DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1469-7998.2009.00606.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMortola, J.P.10aResting breathing frequency in aquatic birds: a comparative analysis with terrestrial species  ap. 210-218.  aSeveral studies have indicated that in birds breathing frequency (f, breaths min⁻¹) scales to the -1/3 of body weight (W, kg); this is different from the -1/4 of mammals. We wondered if this discrepancy was due to the peculiar scaling pattern of aquatic birds, as is the case of aquatic mammals. In fact, we had noted previously that the allometric scaling of f differs considerably between aquatic and terrestrial mammals, respectively, W⁻⁰.⁴² and W⁻⁰.²⁵. Measurements of f were obtained in 48 aquatic birds of 22 species and in 35 terrestrial birds of 27 species, during resting conditions on land. Additional data from 11 aquatic and 14 terrestrial species, different from the ones measured, were obtained from the literature. The allometric curve of all species combined (terrestrial and aquatic, n=74) was f=13.3W⁻⁰.³⁶, similar to what is reported in previous studies. However, the allometric curve of the aquatic species (n=33, f=14.5W⁻⁰.⁵⁶) differed greatly (P<0.001) from that of the terrestrial species (n=41, f=13.4W⁻⁰.²⁶). On average, f of aquatic birds of the 3-5 kg range was 63%, and that of birds of larger size was 57%, of the values of terrestrial birds of similar W. We conclude that, as in mammals, also in terrestrial birds f scales to the -1/4 exponent of W. The similarity of the scaling patterns of f between aquatic birds and mammals suggests a common breathing adaptation to life in the aquatic environment irrespective of phylogenetic relations. 3aallometry 0aavian respiration 0abreathing pattern 0acontrol of breathing 0adiving1 aSeguin, J.0 tJournal of zoology.g2009 Oct., v. 279, no. 2 p.210-218dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0952-83697nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1469-7998.2009.00606.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20090911b20091106c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle01338naa a2200433 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024001800097040001800115100001600133245006000149300001600209500001500225520015300240650001900393650002200412650002300434650001700457650001200474650002500486650002000511650001100531650002400542650000900566650002400575650002700599650003500626653001300661700001600674700002000690700001900710773010200729852000900831939003300840945000800873946001100881655001200892991614786360742620221121015252.0830303e198204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aPAR830020592DNAL7 a70466572pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSedegah, M.10aCross-reactivity and cross-protection in murine malaria  ap. 219-221.  a2019-12-04  aPlasmodium yoelii infection followed by P. berghei challenge in mice, antibody against P. yoelii and P. berghei antigens, relationship to protection 3across reaction 3aPlasmodium yoelii 3aPlasmodium berghei 3aimmunization 2aAnimals 2aAntibodiesxanalysis 2aCross Reactions 2aFemale 2aMalariaximmunology 2aMice 2aMice, Inbred BALB C 2aPlasmodiumximmunology 2aPlasmodium bergheiximmunology 0aimmunity1 aTosta, C.E.1 aHenderson, D.C.1 aWedderburn, N.0 tAnnals of tropical medicine and parasitology.g1982 Apr., v. 76, no. 2 p.219-221x0003-49837nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19830303c00000000  aPAR  aNon-US 7aarticle03019naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004100111040001800152072000900170100001800179245009000197300001800287500002400305500001500329520121700344650002101561650002001582650001401602650002101616650001801637650002001655650001501675650001401690650003001704650003501734650005601769650003901825650002401864650001801888650002701906650003001933650002401963650003301987650004402020650001902064653001302083653003202096653002802128653001502156700001402171773009102185852000902276856007502285930003302360945002502393946001102418655001202429IND4384901820221120222421.0061102e200606  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438490182DNAL7 a166788692pmid7 a10.1016/j.phytochem.2006.03.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF6001 aHalbwirth, H.13aAn NADPH and FAD dependent enzyme catalyzes hydroxylation of flavonoids in position 8  ap. 1080-1087.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aYellow flavonols contribute to flower pigmentation in Asteraceae. In contrast to common flavonols, they show additional hydroxyl groups in position 6 and/or 8 of the aromatic A-ring in addition to the basic 5,7-hydroxylation pattern. An enzyme introducing a hydroxyl group in position 8 of flavonols and flavones was demonstrated for the first time with enzyme preparations from petals of Chrysanthemum segetum. Flavanones, dihydroflavonols and glucosylated flavonols and flavones were not accepted as substrates. The enzyme was localized in the microsomal fraction and uses NADPH and FAD as cofactors. Experiments with carbon monoxide/blue light and with antibodies specific for cytochrome P450 reductase did not indicate the involvement of a classical cytochrome P450 dependent monooxygenase in the reaction. Thus, the flavonoid 8-hydroxylase represents a novel type of hydroxylating enzyme in the flavonoid pathway. Apart from flavonoid 8-hydroxylase activity, the presence of all enzymes involved in the formation of flavonoid 7-O-glucosides in C. segetum was demonstrated. The pathway leading to 8-hydroxyflavonoids in C. segetum has been derived from enzyme activities and substrate specificities observed. 3aGlebionis segeta 3aNADP (coenzyme) 3aflavonols 3acytochrome P-450 3ahydroxylation 3aenzyme activity 3aoxygenases 2aCatalysis 2aChrysanthemumxenzymology 2aCytochrome P-450 Enzyme System 2aFlavin-Adenine Dinucleotidexchemistryxmetabolism. 2aFlavonoidsxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aFlowersxenzymology 2aHydroxylation 2aMicrosomesxenzymology 2aMixed Function Oxygenases 2aMolecular Structure 2aNADPxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aOxidoreductasesxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aPlant Proteins 0aflavones 0aflavin-adenine dinucleotide 0aflavonoid 8-hydroxylase 0aflavonoids1 aStich, K.0 tPhytochemistry.g2006 June, v. 67, no. 11 p.1080-1087dPergamon Pressx0031-94227nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.phytochem.2006.03.0083electronic resource  a20061113b20061202c00000000  aINDdRSCe2006/11/13  aNon-US 7aarticle02889naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002300164245010800187300001400295520134800309650001301657650001701670650002401687650001101711650002601722650002901748650001001777650002601787650002001813650001201833650001001845650000901855650002301864650001201887650001601899650002701915650003401942650001301976651001101989651001102000653001902011653002502030653001402055700002002069773013202089852000902221856008502230930003302315946001102348655001202359IND4432725420221120233203.0100213e201003  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443272542DNAL7 a192385692pmid7 a10.1007/s10661-009-0777-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNetto, Sérgio A. 14aThe response of nematode assemblages to intensive mussel farming in coastal sediments (Southern Brazil)  ap. 81-93.  aThe impact of mussel farms on the benthic environment was investigated using free-living nematode assemblages as indicators of environmental condition of the Enseada do Brito, a shallow embayment in South Brazil. The studied area is located at the State of Santa Catarina, responsible for 90% of the production of mussel farmed in the country. Samplings were carried out quarterly, from July 2004 to May 2005, below mussel ropes and at control sites located 300 m apart from the longlines. The results suggested that the mussel culture changed ecological functioning of the benthic environment at studied coastal embayment. The intense organic loads due to the biodeposition of the mussel farms, which had been in production for more than 10 years, have turned fine and well-sorted sand bottoms into a muddy deposit with significantly higher total organic content than the control. The number of nematode genera, diversity, dominance and trophic diversity were significantly lower under the mussel farms than at the control sites. The mussel farms biodeposition had also affected the temporal variability of nematode assemblages, which was detected only for samples at the control sites. The low depth and environmental energy, together with the age of the farms, were probably responsible for the observed changes in the nematode assemblages. 3aNematoda 3abenthic zone 3aecological function 3aenergy 3aenvironmental factors 3aenvironmental indicators 3afarms 3afree-living nematodes 3amollusc culture 3amussels 3aropes 3asand 3atemporal variation 2aAnimals 2aAquaculture 2aBivalviaxparasitology 2aGeologic Sedimentsxchemistry 2aNematoda 3aBrazil 0aBrazil 0aMussel culture 0aNematode assemblages 0aMeiofauna1 aValgas, Israel 0 tEnvironmental monitoring and assessment.g2010 Mar., v. 162, no. 1-4 p.81-93dDordrecht : Springer Netherlandsx0167-63697nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-009-0777-03Available from publisher's Web site  a20100213b20100305c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03295naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001500152245006300167300001600230500001500246520202100261650000902282650001102291650002102302650002602323650001402349650001202363650001102375650003202386650002302418650001602441650002102457650001002478650002602488651001202514653001302526653001602539700001802555700001802573773007602591852000902667856009202676930003302768945001302801946001102814655001202825IND2323415920221120223107.0011010e200108  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232341592DNAL7 a10.1046/j.0022-0477.2001.00586.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMakila, M.10aAapa mires as a carbon sink and source during the Holocene  ap. 589-599.  a2019-12-04  a1. The vertical and horizontal dynamics of peat carbon accumulation in Ruosuo aapa mire, north-central Finland, were investigated in an attempt to understand variations in carbon accumulation over time. 2. Paludification began around 8700 BP (9600 cal BP). The long-term net carbon accumulation rate, based on vertical and lateral growth, was 8.0 g C m(-2) year(-1). Variations in carbon accumulation rates can be explained to a great extent by natural succession and variations in local conditions, but the role of climate cannot be ignored. 3. The marked decline in carbon accumulation rates after 6100 BP (7000 cal BP) may indicate a relatively dry and warm climate. The levelling out and subsequent increase in carbon accumulation rates after 4000 BP (4500 cal BP) indicates the development of a cooler and moister climate. 4. The low long-term net carbon accumulation rate and the high carbon content per unit volume in the layer underlying the surficial peat is typical for a wet aapa mire. The continuous penetration of roots, mostly sedge, results in carbon input into the underlying peat layer and contributes to the intensive decay of the surficial peat due to high biological activity. 5. Although one-third of the apparent carbon has accumulated during the last 2000 years, most of Ruosuo is approaching the stage where primary production does not adequately compensate for overall carbon loss. The declining net carbon accumulation rates from the base up to the depth of 80 cm may indicate a real delayed trend in net carbon accumulation rates. 6. We suggest that under the present climatic conditions the northern circumpolar wet mires are significant sources of greenhouse gases. In addition to high methane production, northern aapa mires also have lower carbon accumulation rates than more southern raised bogs. 7. Our results, which are based on horizontal and vertical carbon accumulation rates, suggest that the earlier published carbon accumulation rates in Finnish aapa mires are overestimated. 3apeat 3avolume 3apaleoclimatology 3aecological succession 3apeatlands 3amethane 3acarbon 3abiological activity in soil 3abiomass production 3adegradation 3aclimatic factors 3aroots 3abiogeochemical cycles 3aFinland 0awetlands 0agrowth rate1 aSaarnisto, M.1 aKankainen, T.0 tJournal of ecology.g2001 Aug., v. 89, no. 4 p.589-599x0022-04777nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.0022-0477.2001.00586.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20011202b20011206c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US 7aarticle03144naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100001700171245011600188300001600304520135100320650002801671650002401699650001701723650001001740650004201750650003301792650005201825650002801877650001101905650001101916650003401927650001601961650004901977650004402026650002602070650002302096653003002119653002302149653003102172653002702203653001202230700002102242700002302263700001602286700001902302700001402321773011002335852000902445856009202454930003302546946001102579655001202590IND4425788720221120211117.0090911e200910  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442578872DNAL7 a185408772pmid7 a10.1111/j.1365-2303.2008.00560.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGhigna, M.R.10aDeep-seated rectal/anal basaloid carcinoma: useful immunocytochemistry in rare squamous cell carcinoma variants  ap. 315-320.  aTo report the cytological aspects of ano-rectal basaloid carcinoma (BC) variant in endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration (EUS-FNA) conventional and liquid-based cytology (LBC), in a series of 10 cases of deep-seated squamous cell carcinomas (SCC), and to discuss the diagnostic difficulties in interpreting the morphology and immunocytochemical findings. Ten cases of EUS-FNA smears and LBC specimens of deep-seated pelvic masses were retrospectively collected from January 2001 to November 2006. Ten EUS-FNA specimen cases were SCC, eight corresponding to usual SCC and two to BC-variant. Of these two cases, only one was correctly diagnosed by EUS-FNA specimen, whereas in the second case, the initial cytological diagnosis was poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma and the final diagnosis of basaloid carcinoma variant was established on surgical resection. Immunocytochemistry (ICC) using CK7, CK20 and CK34βe12 on FNA specimens confirmed the diagnosis retrospectively. The diagnosis of basaloid variant of SCC in a rectal location can be very difficult, both on account of the uncommon location and because of the low specificity of morphological aspects on EUS-FNA smears. The immunocytochemical technique, including a limited spectrum of keratins (CK7, CK20, CK34βe12, and p63) is necessary to avoid this diagnostic pitfall. 3asquamous cell carcinoma 3aimmunocytochemistry 3acell biology 2aAdult 2aAnus Neoplasmsxdiagnosisxpathology. 2aBiopsy, Fine-Needlexmethods 2aCarcinoma, Squamous Cellxdiagnosisxpathology. 2aEndosonographyxmethods 2aFemale 2aHumans 2aImmunohistochemistryxmethods 2aMiddle Aged 2aNeoplasms, Basal Cellxdiagnosisxpathology. 2aRectal Neoplasmsxdiagnosisxpathology. 2aRetrospective Studies 2aBiomarkers, Tumor. 0aanal and rectal carcinoma 0abasaloid carcinoma 0aendoscopic ultrasonography 0afine needle aspiration 0aEUS FNA1 aDrak Alsibai, K.1 aPorras Martín, J.1 aPalazzo, L.1 aGodchaux, J.M.1 aFabre, M.0 tCytopathology.g2009 Oct., v. 20, no. 5 p.315-320dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0956-55077nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2303.2008.00560.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20090911b20091106c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02867naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001500152245016100167300001600328500001500344520141600359650002801775650001101803650001401814650001701828650001301845650001601858650002101874650002401895650001701919650001601936650001601952650001501968650001901983651001002002653002402012653001502036653000802051653001502059700001202074700002402086700001702110773007602127852000902203856009202212930003302304945001302337946001102350655001202361IND2323417720221120211105.0011010e200108  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232341772DNAL7 a10.1046/j.1365-2745.2001.00575.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTapias, R.10aCanopy seed banks in Mediterranean pines of south-eastern Spain: a comparison between Pinus halepensis Mill., P. pinaster Ait., P. nigra Arn. and P. pinea L  ap. 629-638.  a2019-12-04  a1. Canopy seed banks were analysed in post-fire stands of Pinus halepensis, P. pinaster, P. nigra, and P. pinea. We determined age when flowering begins, age of first cone bearing, presence of serotinous cones and cone-opening temperatures. 2. By 15 years after the fire, P. halepensis had developed a large canopy seed bank (3-100 x 10(4) seeds ha(-1)). Fruiting started at 5 years of age. More than 86% of the cones were serotinous and had opening temperatures from 49.3 to 51.3 degrees C. Cones from adult trees opened at lower temperatures than those from young trees. 3. A 16-year-old P. pinaster stand had a smaller seed bank (12000 viable seeds ha(-1)) and a lower percentage of serotinous cones (66.7%), with lower cone-opening temperature (45.8 +/- 0.8 degrees C) and later first fruiting (12 years) than any of our three P. halepensis populations. 4. Populations of P. nigra and P. pinea did not show any fire adaptations: flowering was insignificant even 15 years after fire, and none of the cones produced were serotinous. 5. Serotinous cones represent a fire-survival strategy for P. halepensis and P. pinaster. Early flowering is also necessary for successful post-fire colonization in species or populations where crown fires are frequent. Late flowering and non-serotinous cones of P. nigra and P. pinea suggest that they may have evolved where ignition leads only to low intensity ground fires. 3ainterspecific variation 3acanopy 3aflowering 3afire ecology 3atree age 3aPinus nigra 3aPinus halepensis 3asexual reproduction 3aforest fires 3atemperature 3aPinus pinea 3aseed cones 3aPinus pinaster 3aSpain 0aspecies differences 0aseed banks 0aage 0aadaptation1 aGil, L.1 aFuentes-Utrilla, P.1 aPardos, J.A.0 tJournal of ecology.g2001 Aug., v. 89, no. 4 p.629-638x0022-04777nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-2745.2001.00575.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20011202b20011206c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US 7aarticle02730naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002600164245014800190300001600338520098500354650002101339650001401360650001001374650000901384650005301393650004701446650002501493650002701518650003201545650001101577650001101588650002001599650001801619650001601637650005901653650003601712650001801748650003101766651003301797653003101830653001901861700002801880700001701908700002001925773011701945852000902062856008502071930003302156946001102189655001202200IND4437069420221120211048.0100514e201006  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443706942DNAL7 a198064492pmid7 a10.1007/s10549-009-0564-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHerold, Christina I. 10aReliable data on 5- and 10-year survival provide accurate estimates of 15-year survival in estrogen receptor-positive early-stage breast cancer  ap. 771-776.  aThere are few studies of model-based survival projections using early empirical results for estimating long-term survival. Utilizing Early Breast Cancer Trialists' Collaborative Group (EBCTCG) data, a Markov model was generated to compare empirical results with those modeled beyond the empirical result time horizon in estrogen receptor (ER)-positive early-stage breast cancer (ESBC). Modeling 15-year survival based on 5- and 10-year EBCTCG data resulted in an average error estimate in breast cancer mortality of 0.75% [range −0.83 to 2.19%]. Although modeling life expectancy differences ranged from an underestimate of −7.93% to an overestimate of 12.64%, over the span of 15 years this corresponded to a loss of 18 days or a gain of 40 days of life. Reliable early survival data may be used to generate models that accurately estimate 15-year survival in ER-positive ESBC. Whether early survival data can be employed over the lifetime horizon remains to be demonstrated. 3abreast neoplasms 3atamoxifen 2aAdult 2aAged 2aAntineoplastic Agents, Hormonalxtherapeutic use 2aBreast Neoplasmsxdrug therapyxmortality. 2aCase-Control Studies 2aChemotherapy, Adjuvant 2aDecision Support Techniques 2aFemale 2aHumans 2aLife Expectancy 2aMarkov Chains 2aMiddle Aged 2aNeoplasms, Hormone-Dependentxdrug therapyxmortality. 2aReceptors, Estrogenxmetabolism 2aSurvival Rate 2aTamoxifenxtherapeutic use 0aUnited Statesxepidemiology. 0aAdjuvant endocrine therapy 0aSurvival model1 aDjulbegović, Benjamin.1 aHozo, Iztok 1 aLyman, Gary H. 0 tBreast cancer research and treatment.g2010 June, v. 121, no. 3 p.771-776dBoston : Springer USx0167-68067nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10549-009-0564-13Available from publisher's Web site  a20100514b20100605c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03777naa a2200733 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100001600171245016200187300001800349520153300367650001301900650002601913650001701939650001101956650001201967650002101979650001002000650001902010650000902029650001302038650003002051650003302081650003602114650001502150650001302165650001202178650001302190650001202203650005002215650001702265650001102282650002102293650003202314650002902346650003002375650002902405650001102434650002202445650002302467650003902490651001602529651001002545651001002555653001902565653002402584653001902608653003402627653003802661653000802699700001802707700001702725700001302742773013102755852000902886856009202895930003302987946001103020655001203031IND4425798320221120211215.0090911e200910  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442579832DNAL7 a194863922pmid7 a10.1111/j.1365-2672.2009.04311.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBonizzi, I.10aInvestigating the relationship between raw milk bacterial composition, as described by intergenic transcribed spacer-PCR fingerprinting, and pasture altitude  ap. 1319-1329.  aTo assess the bacterial biodiversity level in bovine raw milk used to produce Fontina, a Protected Designation of Origin cheese manufactured at high-altitude pastures and in valleys of Valle d'Aosta region (North-western Italian Alps) without any starters. To study the relation between microbial composition and pasture altitude, in order to distinguish high-altitude milk against valley and lowland milk. The microflora from milks sampled at different alpine pasture, valley and lowland farms were fingerprinted by PCR of the 16S-23S intergenic transcribed spacers (ITS-PCR). The resulting band patterns were analysed by generalized multivariate statistical techniques to handle discrete (band presence-absence) and continuous (altitude) information. The fingerprints featured numerous bands and marked variability indicating complex, differentiated bacterial communities. Alpine pasture milks were distinguished from lowland ones by cluster analysis, while this technique less clearly discriminated alpine pasture and valley samples. Generalized principal component analysis and clustering-after-ordination enabled a more effective distinction of alpine pasture, valley and lowland samples. Alpine raw milks for Fontina production contain highly diverse bacterial communities, the composition of which is related to the altitude of the pasture where milk was produced. This research may provide analytical support to the important issue represented by the authentication of the geographical origin of alpine milk productions. 3aaltitude 3abacterial communities 3abiodiversity 3acattle 3acheeses 3acluster analysis 3afarms 3amicroorganisms 3amilk 3apastures 3apolymerase chain reaction 3aprincipal component analysis 3aprotected designation of origin 3aprovenance 3araw milk 3avalleys 2aAltitude 2aAnimals 2aBacteriaxgeneticsxisolation & purification. 2aBiodiversity 2aCattle 2aCluster Analysis 2aDNA Fingerprintingxmethods 2aDNA, Bacterialxanalysis 2aDNA, Intergenicxanalysis 2aDNA, Ribosomalxgenetics 2aFemale 2aFood Microbiology 2aMilkxmicrobiology 2aPolymerase Chain Reactionxmethods 3aAlps region 3aItaly 0aItaly 0aalpine pasture 0abacterial community 0afingerprinting 0aintergenic transcribed spacer 0amultivariate statistical analysis 0aPCR1 aBuffoni, J.N.1 aFeligini, M.1 aEnne, G.0 tJournal of applied microbiology.g2009 Oct., v. 107, no. 4 p.1319-1329dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx1364-50727nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2672.2009.04311.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20090911b20091106c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03473naa a2200625 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100001500171245013300186300001800319520141000337650002101747650001301768650001701781650001701798650001901815650002101834650001601855650001101871650001101882650001901893650001001912650001401922650001101936650003601947650007401983650004802057650003202105650003902137650002002176650003502196650003002231650005902261650001102320650003302331650001902364650003202383650004802415653002102463653001202484700001502496700001402511700001702525700001702542773013102559852000902690856009202699930003302791946001102824655001202835IND4425798120221120201520.0090911e200910  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442579812DNAL7 a194864012pmid7 a10.1111/j.1365-2672.2009.04312.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAkerey, B.10aIn vitro efficacy of nisin Z against Candida albicans adhesion and transition following contact with normal human gingival cells  ap. 1298-1307.  aTo investigate the nisin Z innocuity using normal human gingival fibroblast and epithelial cell cultures, and its synergistic effect with these gingival cells against Candida albicans adhesion and transition from blastospore to hyphal form. Cells were cultured to 80% confluence and infected with C. albicans in the absence or presence of various concentrations of nisin Z. Our results indicate that only high concentrations of nisin Z promoted gingival cell detachment and differentiation. Determination of the LD₅₀ showed that the fibroblasts were able to tolerate up to 80 μg ml⁻¹ for 24 h, dropping thereafter to 62 μg ml⁻¹ after 72 h of contact, compared to 160 μg ml⁻¹ after 24 h, and 80 μg ml⁻¹ after 72 h recorded by the gingival epithelial cells which displayed a greater resistance to nisin Z. The use of nisin Z even at low concentration (25 μg ml⁻¹) at appropriate concentrations with gingival cells significantly reduced C. albicans adhesion to gingival monolayer cultures and inhibited the yeast's transition. These findings show that when used at non-toxic levels for human cells, nisin Z can be effective against C. albicans adhesion and transition and may synergistically interact with gingival cells for an efficient resistance against C. albicans. This study suggests the potential usefulness of nisin Z as an antifungal agent, when used in an appropriate range. 3aCandida albicans 3aadhesion 3ablastospores 3acell culture 3acultured cells 3aepithelial cells 3afibroblasts 3ahumans 3ahyphae 3alethal dose 50 3anisin 3asynergism 3ayeasts 2aAntifungal Agentsxpharmacology 2aCandida albicansxdrug effectsxgrowth & developmentxultrastructure. 2aCandidiasis, Oralxmicrobiologyxpathology. 2aCell Adhesionxdrug effects 2aCell Differentiationxdrug effects 2aCells, Cultured 2aEpithelial Cellsxdrug effects 2aFibroblastsxdrug effects 2aGingivaxcytologyxdrug effectsxgrowth & development. 2aHumans 2aHyphaexgrowth & development 2aLethal Dose 50 2aMicrobial Sensitivity Tests 2aNisinxanalogs & derivativesxpharmacology. 0aantifungal agent 0anisin Z1 aLe-Lay, C.1 aFliss, I.1 aSubirade, M.1 aRouabhia, M.0 tJournal of applied microbiology.g2009 Oct., v. 107, no. 4 p.1298-1307dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx1364-50727nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2672.2009.04312.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20090911b20091106c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02974naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100001900171245009200190300001800282520128000300650002701580650000801607650001201615650001501627650002801642650001901670650001601689650005001705650002801755650003501783650003201818650003801850650003001888650002801918650006801946650002302014650002802037653003002065653002202095700001702117700001702134700001302151700001602164773013102180852000902311856009202320930003302412946001102445655001202456IND4425795820221120165214.0090911e200910  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442579582DNAL7 a194864062pmid7 a10.1111/j.1365-2672.2009.04299.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPercival, R.S.10aControl of microbial contamination in dental unit water systems using tetra-sodium EDTA  ap. 1081-1088.  aTo examine the efficacy of tetra-sodium EDTA in controlling microbial contamination of dental unit water systems (DUWS). Ten dental units were treated once a week with either 4% or 8% tetra-sodium EDTA for four or two consecutive weeks, respectively. Before treatment, 43% and 60% of the water samples from the air/water triple syringe and high-speed hand-pieces, respectively, exceeded the American Dental Association (ADA) guidelines of 200 CFU ml⁻¹ water during a 6-week baseline period. After each weekend treatment, the levels of microbial contamination in all DUWS fell significantly (P < 0·001) to below the ADA guideline. By the end of the week, microbial counts in the outflowing water had returned to baseline levels indicating a transient effect of single doses of tetra-sodium EDTA, and the need for multiple applications. The biofilms were virtually eliminated after a single weekend treatment. Tetra-sodium EDTA is effective in controlling microbial contamination in DUWS. Inexpensive, effective and safe products for reducing the microbial load of water from DUWS are needed to meet ADA and other national guidelines. Tetra-sodium EDTA can significantly reduce microbial biofilms and bacterial counts in outflowing water, and is compatible for use in DUWS. 3aEDTA (chelating agent) 3aair 3abiofilm 3aguidelines 3amicrobial contamination 3amicrobial load 3aplate count 2aBiofilmsxdrug effectsxgrowth & development. 2aColony Count, Microbial 2aDental Equipmentxmicrobiology 2aDisinfectantsxpharmacology 2aDisinfectionxmethodsxstandards. 2aEdetic Acidxpharmacology 2aEquipment Contamination 2aGram-Negative Bacteriaxdrug effectsxisolation & purification. 2aWater Microbiology 2aWater Supplyxstandards 0adental unit water systems 0atetra-sodium EDTA1 aDevine, D.A.1 aNattress, B.1 aKite, P.1 aMarsh, P.D.0 tJournal of applied microbiology.g2009 Oct., v. 107, no. 4 p.1081-1088dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx1364-50727nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2672.2009.04299.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20090911b20091106c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03205naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100001600171245014900187300001800336520153100354650002101885650000901906650002501915650001001940650002201950650003701972650003302009650003602042650005202078650002502130650005802155650001302213650003202226650003302258653002502291653001402316653002102330700001602351700001602367700001402383700001202397700001402409773013102423852000902554856009202563930003302655946001102688655001202699IND4425795720221120155325.0090911e200910  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442579572DNAL7 a194262752pmid7 a10.1111/j.1365-2672.2009.04292.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKong, W.-J.10aInvestigation of the anti-fungal activity of coptisine on Candida albicans growth by microcalorimetry combined with principal component analysis  ap. 1072-1080.  aThis study investigated the anti-fungal activity of coptisine on Candida albicans growth. The metabolic power-time curves of Candida albicans growth at 37°C affected by coptisine were measured by microcalorimetry using an LKB-2277 Bioactivity Monitor with stop-flow mode. Then, the diameter of inhibitory zones in the agar layer was observed using agar cup method, and the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of coptisine on Candida albicans growth was determined by serial dilution method. From the principal component analysis on nine quantitative parameters obtained from the power-time curves, we could easily evaluate the anti-fungal activity of coptisine by analysing the change of values of the main two parameters, growth rate constant k and maximum power output in the log phase Pm, log. The results showed that coptisine had strong anti-fungal activity: at a low concentration (45 μg ml⁻¹) began to inhibit the growth of Candida albicans and at a high concentration (500 μg ml⁻¹) completely inhibited Candida albicans growth. Coptisine gave big inhibitory zones with diameters between 11 and 43 mm within test range, and the MIC of it was 1000 μg ml⁻¹. Coptisine had strong anti-fungal activity on Candida albicans growth. The method of microcalorimetry applied for the assay of anti-fungal activity of coptisine was quantitative, sensitive and simple. This work will provide useful information for the development of chemical biology policy in the use of anti-microbials in food and drug production. 3aCandida albicans 3aagar 3abioactive properties 3adrugs 3aissues and policy 3aminimum inhibitory concentration 3aprincipal component analysis 2aAntifungal Agentsxpharmacology 2aBerberinexanalogs & derivativesxpharmacology. 2aCalorimetryxmethods 2aCandida albicansxdrug effectsxgrowth & development. 2aKinetics 2aMicrobial Sensitivity Tests 2aPrincipal Component Analysis 0aanti-fungal activity 0acoptisine 0amicrocalorimetry1 aZhao, Y.-L.1 aXiao, X.-H.1 aLi, Z.-L.1 aJin, C.1 aLi, H.-B.0 tJournal of applied microbiology.g2009 Oct., v. 107, no. 4 p.1072-1080dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx1364-50727nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2672.2009.04292.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20090911b20091106c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02425naa a2200313 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245009100127300001500218520158400233650001701817650001301834650001101847653002201858653001101880653001101891653000901902700001801911700001401929773008801943852000902031930003302040945001302073946001302086655001202099IND2196461120221120144705.0990114e199806  ctu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND219646112DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGhiselli, R.10aFoodservice design: trends, space, allocation, and factors that influence kitchen size  ap. 89-105.  aA number of factors including energy and labor costs have affected facility planning and space allocation in foodservice. Vast kitchens and unrestricted equipment usage may no longer be acceptable or feasible. The purpose of this study was to obtain a clearer understanding of current design schemes within this environment. In particular, to identify the amount of space that has recently been allocated to functional areas in kitchens in certain quantity food settings; to determine whether kitchen size and allocation were different by type of operation; and to identify current factors which most influence their size, and the methods used to achieve reduction. A mail questionnaire was developed and sent to members of the Foodservice Consultants Society International (FCSI) who were identified as foodservice consultants in the U.S. The respondents indicated that kitchens being built today were smaller than those that were built in the '60's and '70's but not the '80's. Moreover, the consultants expected that kitchens would continue to get smaller. In their most recent design projects, twice as much space (1.99:1) on average had been assigned to the dining area as to the kitchen area, but there were variations by type of foodservice. The most important factor when determining the size of a quantity food kitchen was the type of operation. The next most important factors were the number of meals per hour and the choice of menu items. This study is useful to foodservice operators in the preliminary stages of planning new facilities or remodeling existing sites. 3afood service 3akitchens 3adesign 0aphysical planning 0atrends 0alayout 0asize1 aAlmanza, B.A.1 aOzaki, S.0 tJournal of food service systems.g1998 June, v. 10, no. 2 p.89-105x0196-42837nnas  aDNAL  a19990301b19990308c00000000  aINDdLDP  aOther US 7aarticle03076naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001600152245014400168300001800312500001500330520151500345650001901860650002101879650002701900650002401927650002901951650002701980650001802007650001302025650001002038650001202048650001702060650001502077650002502092650001802117650001202135653001202147653001102159653002702170653001702197653001702214653002202231653002402253700002102277773011502298852000902413856009202422930003302514946001102547655001202558IND4425801820221120144654.0090911e200910  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442580182DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1461-0248.2009.01351.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Lingli12aA review of nitrogen enrichment effects on three biogenic GHGs: the CO₂ sink may be largely offset by stimulated N₂O and CH₄ emission  ap. 1103-1117.  a2019-12-04  aAnthropogenic nitrogen (N) enrichment of ecosystems, mainly from fuel combustion and fertilizer application, alters biogeochemical cycling of ecosystems in a way that leads to altered flux of biogenic greenhouse gases (GHGs). Our meta-analysis of 313 observations across 109 studies evaluated the effect of N addition on the flux of three major GHGs: CO₂, CH₄ and N₂O. The objective was to quantitatively synthesize data from agricultural and non-agricultural terrestrial ecosystems across the globe and examine whether factors, such as ecosystem type, N addition level and chemical form of N addition influence the direction and magnitude of GHG fluxes. Results indicate that N addition increased ecosystem carbon content of forests by 6%, marginally increased soil organic carbon of agricultural systems by 2%, but had no significant effect on net ecosystem CO₂ exchange for non-forest natural ecosystems. Across all ecosystems, N addition increased CH₄ emission by 97%, reduced CH₄ uptake by 38% and increased N₂O emission by 216%. The net effect of N on the global GHG budget is calculated and this topic is reviewed. Most often N addition is considered to increase forest C sequestration without consideration of N stimulation of GHG production in other ecosystems. However, our study indicated that although N addition increased the global terrestrial C sink, the CO₂ reduction could be largely offset (53-76%) by N stimulation of global CH₄ and N₂O emission from multiple ecosystems. 3acarbon dioxide 3agreenhouse gases 3aterrestrial ecosystems 3asoil organic carbon 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3afertilizer application 3ameta-analysis 3anitrogen 3afuels 3amethane 3acarbon sinks 3acombustion 3acarbon sequestration 3anitrous oxide 3aforests 0awetland 0acarbon 0aemission/uptake factor 0aN saturation 0aN deposition 0aglobal GHG budget 0aAgricultural system1 aGreaver, Tara L.0 tEcology letters.g2009 Oct., v. 12, no. 10 p.1103-1117dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx1461-023X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1461-0248.2009.01351.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20090911b20091106c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03027naa a2200637 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100002100171245011600192300001600308520101500324650001901339650001601358650001901374650001301393650004101406650001001447650001301457650001201470650001101482650001201493650001701505650001401522650001201536650002001548650002901568650002001597650001401617650001701631650004901648650004101697650003801738650001801776650001301794650004601807650001501853650001701868650004201885650004101927650003901968650001802007700002202025700001802047700002502065700001902090773012302109852000902232856009202241930003302333946001102366655001202377IND4425804220221120144630.0090911e200910  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442580422DNAL7 a197026482pmid7 a10.1111/j.1467-7652.2009.00437.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFoito, Alexandre10aTranscriptional and metabolic profiles of Lolium perenne L. genotypes in response to a PEG-induced water stress  ap. 719-732.  aMetabolic profiling was carried out in the forage grass Lolium perenne L. (perennial ryegrass) to uncover mechanisms involved in the plants response to water stress. When leaf and root materials from two genotypes, with a contrasting water stress response, were analysed by GC-MS, a clear difference in the metabolic profiles of the leaf tissue under water stress was observed. Differences were principally due to a reduction in fatty acid levels in the more susceptible Cashel genotype and an increase in sugars and compatible solutes in the more tolerant PI 462336 genotype. Sugars with a significant increase included: raffinose, trehalose, glucose, fructose and maltose. Increasing the ability of perennial ryegrass to accumulate these sugars in response to a water deficit may lead to more tolerant varieties. The metabolomics approach was combined with a transcriptomics approach in the water stress tolerant genotype PI 462336, which has identified perennial ryegrass genes regulated under water stress. 3aLolium perenne 3afatty acids 3aforage grasses 3afructose 3agas chromatography-mass spectrometry 3agenes 3agenotype 3aglucose 3aleaves 3amaltose 3ametabolomics 3araffinose 3asolutes 3astress response 3atranscription (genetics) 3atranscriptomics 3atrehalose 3awater stress 2aDehydrationxchemically inducedxmetabolism. 2aGas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry 2aGene Expression Regulation, Plant 2aGenome, Plant 2aGenotype 2aLoliumxgeneticsxmetabolismxphysiology. 2aMetabolome 2aMetabolomics 2aPlant Leavesxmetabolismxphysiology. 2aPlant Rootsxmetabolismxphysiology. 2aPolyethylene Glycolsxpharmacology 2aUp-Regulation1 aByrne, Stephen L.1 aShepherd, Tom1 aStewart, D.q(Derek)1 aBarth, Susanne0 tPlant biotechnology journal.g2009 Oct., v. 7, no. 8 p.719-732dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx1467-76447nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1467-7652.2009.00437.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20090911b20091106c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03019naa a2200757 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146072001700164072001700181072001700198100001500215245010500230300001600335500001500351520088200366650001901248650001701267650001701284650001501301650001001316650002301326650002201349650002401371650001701395650001501412650002401427650001901451650001101470650001101481650002401492650001401516650001901530650003901549650002501588650002101613650002201634650001301656650001101669650003201680650003401712650002401746650001401770650001001784650002101794653002301815700001901838700001901857700001501876700002101891700001701912700001801929700001901947700001801966700001901984773008302003852000902086856008502095930003302180945002502213946001102238655001202249IND4375176820221120144633.0051013e200508  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437517682DNAL7 a161743622pmid7 a10.1017/S00220299050010682doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

The emulsion was added to the yogurt mix either before or after the homogenization step and prior to pasteurization. It was then flavoured with a strawberry fruit base and fermented and stored for up to three weeks. The oxidative deterioration of the products was determined by hydroperoxide measurements and by trained and consumer sensory evaluations. The hydroperoxide content of the supplemented yogurts increased over the storage treatment and was unaffected by the stage of addition. The trained panel could distinguish a stronger fishy flavour in both of the supplemented yogurts after 22 days storage, but the consumer panel rated both control and supplemented samples similarly, as 'moderately liked'. 3afood chemistry 3afermentation 3astrawberries 3ashelf life 3aalgae 3alipid peroxidation 3achemical analysis 3aplant fats and oils 3afood storage 3aflavorings 3aomega-3 fatty acids 3apasteurization 3aflavor 3ayogurt 3adietary supplements 3aemulsions 3ahomogenization 2aEmulsionsxadministration & dosage 2aEukaryotaxchemistry 2aFlavoring Agents 2aFood Preservation 2aFragaria 2aHumans 2aHydrogen Peroxidexanalysis 2aOilsxadministration & dosage 2aOxidation-Reduction 2aSensation 2aTaste 2aYogurtxanalysis 0aalgae and seaweeds1 aGallaher, J.J.1 aDjordjevic, D.1 aFaraji, H.1 aMcClements, D.J.1 aDecker, E.A.1 aHollender, R.1 aPeterson, D.G.1 aRoberts, R.F.1 aCoupland, J.N.0 tJournal of dairy research.g2005 Aug., v. 72, no. 3 p.311-316x0022-02997nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S00220299050010683Available from publisher's Web site  a20080422b20080502c00000000  aINDd4CTe2005/12/22  aNon-US 7aarticle03750naa a2200721 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146072001700164072001700181100001300198245011100211300001600322500001500338520166000353650001402013650001702027650001302044650002102057650002002078650001302098650001602111650001602127650001702143650001902160650001302179650002302192650002002215650001902235650001502254650001302269650002102282650002602303650001202329650003002341650002402371650003602395650002802431650002602459650001102485650001802496650002102514650004102535650003502576650003602611650001202647650001002659653002302669653002102692700001602713700001402729700002702743773008302770852000902853856008502862930003302947945002502980946001103005655001203016IND4375067820221120131001.0051007e200508  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437506782DNAL7 a161743592pmid7 a10.1017/S00220299050010192doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Seasonal variation  ap. 287-295.  a2019-12-04  aChanges in nitrogen compounds during ripening of 40 batches of Manchego cheese made from raw milk (24 batches) or pasteurized milk (16 batches) at five different dairies throughout the year were investigated. After ripening for six months, degradation of p-kappa- and beta-caseins was more intense in raw milk cheese and degradation of alpha(s2)-casein in pasteurized milk cheese. Milk pasteurization had no significant effect on breakdown of alpha(s1)-casein. Hydrophobic peptide content did not differ between raw and pasteurized milk cheese, whereas hydrophilic peptide content was higher in raw milk cheese. There were no significant differences between seasons for residual caseins, but hydrophobic peptides were at a higher level in cheese made in autumn and winter and hydrophilic peptides in cheese made in winter and spring. Raw milk cheese had a higher content of total free amino acids and of most individual free amino acids than pasteurized milk cheese. The relative percentages of the individual free amino acids were significantly different for raw milk and pasteurized milk cheeses. The relative percentages of Lys and Ile increased, while those of Val, Leu and Phe decreased during ripening. There were also seasonal variations within the relative percentages of free amino acids. In raw milk cheeses, Asp and Cys were relatively more abundant in those made in autumn, Glu and Arg in cheeses made in winter, and Lys and Ile in cheeses made in spring and summer. Biogenic amines were detected only in raw milk cheese, with the highest levels of histamine, tryptamine and tyramine in cheeses made in spring, winter and spring, respectively. 3ahistamine 3akappa-casein 3araw milk 3afree amino acids 3acheese ripening 3atyramine 3aproteolysis 3abeta-casein 3afood quality 3aalphaS1-casein 3apeptides 3aseasonal variation 3amanchego cheese 3ahydrophobicity 3atryptamine 3aewe milk 3apasteurized milk 2aAmino Acidsxanalysis 2aAnimals 2aBiogenic Aminesxanalysis 2aCaseinsxmetabolism 2aCheesexanalysisxmicrobiology. 2aColony Count, Microbial 2aDiscriminant Analysis 2aFemale 2aFood Handling 2aMilkxenzymology 2aMilk Proteinsxanalysisxmetabolism. 2aPeptide Hydrolasesxmetabolism 2aPeptidesxanalysisxmetabolism. 2aSeasons 2aSheep 0anitrogen compounds 0afood composition1 aSanchez, C.1 aNunez, M.1 aFernández García, E.0 tJournal of dairy research.g2005 Aug., v. 72, no. 3 p.287-295x0022-02997nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S00220299050010193Available from publisher's Web site  a20080422b20080502c00000000  aINDd4CTe2005/12/22  aNon-US 7aarticle02657naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100001700171245008800188300001800276520103900294650001101333650001201344650001301356650001901369650001101388650001401399650001201413650001401425650001101439650001401450650002201464650002301486650002401509650000901533650001701542651001301559651001301572653002201585653003201607653002801639653001001667653002301677653001001700653002801710653002501738700002101763700001701784700001801801773011501819852000901934856009201943930003302035946001102068655001202079IND4425801320221120130922.0090911e200910  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442580132DNAL7 a197089702pmid7 a10.1111/j.1461-0248.2009.01359.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMosser, Anna10aSerengeti real estate: density vs. fitness-based indicators of lion habitat quality  ap. 1050-1060.  aHabitat quality is typically inferred by assuming a direct relationship between consumer density and resource abundance, although it has been suggested that consumer fitness may be a more accurate measure of habitat quality. We examined density vs. fitness-based measures of habitat quality for lions in the Serengeti National Park, Tanzania. A 40-year average of female reproductive success (yearling cubs per female) was best explained by proximity to river confluences, whereas patterns of productivity (yearling cubs per km²) and adult female density (individuals per km²) were associated with more general measures of habitat quality and areas of shelter in poor habitat. This suggests that density may not accurately distinguish between high-quality 'source' areas and low-quality sites that merely provide refuges for effectively non-reproductive individuals. Our results indicate that density may be a misleading indicator of real estate value, particularly for populations that do not conform to an ideal free distribution. 3aadults 3afemales 3ahabitats 3anational parks 3arivers 3ayearlings 2aAnimals 2aEcosystem 2aFemale 2aGeography 2aLionsxphysiology 2aPopulation Density 2aPopulation Dynamics 2aRain 2aTime Factors 3aTanzania 0aTanzania 0aHabitat selection 0aideal despotic distribution 0aideal free distribution 0alions 0aresource selection 0ascale 0aSerengeti National Park 0asource-sink dynamics1 aFryxell, John M.1 aEberly, Lynn1 aPacker, Craig0 tEcology letters.g2009 Oct., v. 12, no. 10 p.1050-1060dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx1461-023X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1461-0248.2009.01359.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20090918b20091106c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02527naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001400110245017800124300001400302520134600316650002601662650002301688650002001711650001901731650001501750650003001765650002001795650001601815650001201831650002301843651001901866653002601885653002401911653002601935700001301961773008701974852000902061930003302070945001302103946001302116655001202129IND2164007620221120130954.0980912e199712  ctu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND216400762DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aClark, J.10aRelationships between labor productivity and factors of production in hospital and hotel foodservice departments--empirical evidence of a typology of food production systems  ap. 23-39.  aA postal survey of up-scale hotels and large hospitals in the UK was used to investigate the relationship between labor productivity and three factors of production: the use of ready prepared vegetables, the amount of equipment available and the use of cook-chill technology. It was found that, both for the hotels and hospitals in the sample, there was a clear positive correlation between labor productivity and both the use of ready prepared vegetables and the use of cook-chill. In contrast, there was a negative correlation between labor productivity and the use of large amounts of equipment. In order to establish the presence of natural typologies of production, cluster analyses were conducted separately on the hospital and hotel data. The analysis for hospitals demonstrated three clear clusters, equivalent to three typologies of production: (1) conventional production, (2) production using large amounts of ready prepared vegetables and (3) production using both ready prepared vegetables and cook-chill. Significantly, the third typology had a much higher labor productivity than was the case for the other typologies. In the case of the hotels, cluster analysis did not indicate such clear typologies. Although six clusters could be identified, these clusters were not so clearly related to differences in labor productivity. 3ahospital food service 3ahotel food service 3afood production 3aprepared foods 3avegetables 3afood processing equipment 3afood technology 3acorrelation 3asurveys 3alabor productivity 3aUnited Kingdom 0afactors of production 0aprepared vegetables 0acook-chill technology1 aKirk, D.0 tJournal of food service systems.g1997 Dec., v. 10, no. 1 p.23-39x0196-42837nnas  aDNAL  a19981102b19981110c00000000  aINDdGHK  aOther US 7aarticle02901naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001800145245007300163300001600236500002400252520191300276650001402189650001202203650001802215650001302233650001202246650001402258650002002272650001102292650000902303650001702312700002302329773010502352852000902457856008502466655001202551IND4459699720221120101110.0110708s2010    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445969972DNAL7 a10.1007/s12229-010-9057-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDulin, Max W.10aPaedomorphosis, Secondary Woodiness, and Insular Woodiness in Plants  ap. 405-490.  aIncludes references  aThe related concepts of paedomorphosis in the secondary xylem, insular woodiness, and secondary woodiness are reviewed and evaluated in order to clearly distinguish the phenomenon involved, and provide a firm foundation for future research in this area. The theory of paedomorphosis refers to the occurrence of certain juvenile xylem characteristics, such as scalariform perforation plates and lateral wall pitting, in the secondary xylem of shrubby, suffrutescent, pachycaulous, and lianoid growth forms. Paedomorphic characteristics are often found in insular woody species, a fact that has caused paedomorphosis to be associated with secondary woodiness. The anatomy of the secondary xylem in Xanthorhiza simplicissima (Ranunculaceae), Coreopsis gigantea (Asteraceae), and Mahonia bealei (Berberidaceae) is described in order to provide specific data for discussion. These species serve as test cases for the presence of edomorphosis, and the evolution of secondary woodiness. The secondary xylem of all three species was found to have a degree of paedomorphosis, with Coreopsis having the greatest number of paedomorphic haracteristics, Xanthorhiza having an intermediate number, and Mahonia possessing only a single characteristic. Plotting the occurrence of the character states woody and nonwoody on phylogenetic trees containing these taxa shows that Coreopsis is secondarily woody, while the ancestry of the other two species cannot be unambiguously established. These results must, however, be considered preliminary as the occurrence of secondary growth in many "herbaceous" plants often goes unreported. Although paedomorphosis is often associated with secondary woodiness, there are examples of paedomorphic wood in primitively woody taxa. One conclusion is that the degree of paedomorphosis may be a better indicator of the mechanical requirements of the shoot then of its evolutionary history. 3aCoreopsis 3aMahonia 3aRanunculaceae 3aancestry 3aneoteny 3aphylogeny 3asecondary xylem 3ashoots 3awood 3awoody plants1 aKirchoff, Bruce K.0 tbotanical review.g2010 Dec., v. 76, no. 4 p.405-490dH.A.

The fruit-colour polymorphism of Myrtus communis, a common Mediterranean shrub, is examined. We investigate whether frugivores affect the maintenance of the polymorphism, whether morphs differ in germination or seedling growth, and whether passage through frugivores' gut affects seed behaviour and seedling growth. 2. Blue berries are very similar in morphological traits and nutrient composition to the rarer white morph. Rates of fruit removal by birds, the main dispersers of this species, did not differ between morphs, suggesting that a colour preference is not involved in maintenance of the polymorphism. 3. Seeds of the two morphs showed the same germinability (final percentage germination) as well as similar rates of germination under controlled conditions (in growth chamber and greenhouse). Outdoors, seeds from blue berries tended to germinate slightly faster (which might give them an early advantage) but differences between morphs disappeared after several weeks of growth. 4. The germination of myrtle seeds is differently affected by passage through the digestive tract of birds, which appeared to significantly increase germinability, and of the carnivorous pine marten, Martes martes, which did not. The different seed retention time in the gut or the chemical composition of the food ingested along with the seeds may be responsible for such differences. 5. The detection of a positive effect of bird ingestion in outdoor conditions, but not in the growth chamber or in the greenhouse, demonstrates the importance of performing germination tests in the natural habitat. 6. Seed size, irrespective of morph, affects the response to passage through the bird gut. Large seeds, which are more rapidly ejected, and are thus less abraded, germinated at a similar speed to non-ingested controls. Variation in seed size within a single species should thus be considered in future studies. 3aMyrtus communis 3abirds 3aMartes martes 3acolor 3aseed dispersal 3aseed germination 3aseedling growth 3adigestion 3afoods 3ahabitats 3aBalearic Islands 0aseed size 0afruits1 aRiera, N.1 aMas, R.E.0 tJournal of ecology.g2001 Oct., v. 89, no. 5 p.749-760x0022-04777nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.0022-0477.2001.00585.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20020401b20020405c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US 7aarticle02648naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001700152245012800169300001600297500001500313520137900328650002801707650001301735650002501748650002601773650002201799650000701821650002601828650001301854650001901867651001201886653001701898653002401915653001601939653001101955700001401966773007601980852000902056856009202065930003302157945001302190946001102203655001202214IND2325284220221120085722.0020208e200110  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232528422DNAL7 a10.1046/j.0022-0477.2001.00596.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVerheyen, K.14aThe relative importance of dispersal limitation of vascular plants in secondary forest succession in Muizen Forest, Belgium  ap. 829-840.  a2019-12-04  a1. Distribution patterns (frequency and percentage cover) of 18 forest plant species were studied in 34 ha of mixed deciduous forest (Muizen Forest, north Belgium). Stands varied in age between 6 and more than 223 years and both slow and fast colonizing species were studied. 2. Detailed land use history data were combined with the species distribution maps to identify species-specific colonization sources and calculate colonization distances. 3. A multiple logistic regression model was constructed with four covariables: pH (which can impose limits on the potential species-distribution), secondary forest age, distance from nearest colonization source and age-distance interaction, to allow us to account for the gradual completion of colonization over time. 4. We could distinguish species which are limited by both dispersal and recruitment (Primula elatior, Arum maculatum and Lamium galeobdolon), mainly by dispersal (Anemone nemorosa, Deschampsia cespitosa), mainly by recruitment (Paris quadrifolia and Polygonatum multiflorum) and by neither (Geum urbanum, Ranunculus ficaria, Glechoma hederacea, Aegopodium podagraria, Ajuga reptans, Adoxa moschatellina and Oxalis acetosella). 5. The low colonizing capacity of ancient forest plants cannot be attributed to a single cause; rather both dispersal and recruitment are limiting but the relative importance varies. 3ainterspecific variation 3atree age 3aspatial distribution 3aecological succession 3asecondary forests 3apH 3astand characteristics 3aland use 3aseed dispersal 3aBelgium 0acolonization 0aspecies differences 0arecruitment 0aplants1 aHermy, M.0 tJournal of ecology.g2001 Oct., v. 89, no. 5 p.829-840x0022-04777nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.0022-0477.2001.00596.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20020401b20020405c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US 7aarticle02986naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100002100171245014200192300001600334520141600350650002801766650001601794650003001810650002201840650005201862650003901914650004801953650003802001650003102039650003002070650001802100650002702118653003402145653002302179653001902202653001302221653002002234700001802254773011102272852000902383856009202392930003302484946001102517655001202528IND4425790220221120063113.0090911e200909  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442579022DNAL7 a194534482pmid7 a10.1111/j.1365-313X.2009.03918.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuang, Nien-Chen14aThe sequences of Arabidopsis GA-INSENSITIVE RNA constitute the motifs that are necessary and sufficient for RNA long-distance trafficking  ap. 921-929.  aIn higher plants a number of physiological processes are regulated by systemic RNA signaling molecules. This phloem-mediated remote-control system provides specific and efficient regulation to fine-tune many plant developmental programs. However, the molecular mechanism underlying long-distance movement of RNA remains to be elucidated. To this end, we examined the long-distance movement of GA-insensitive (GAI) RNA by Arabidopsis inflorescence grafting and RT-PCR analysis. Our results demonstrated that long-distance movement of RNA only occurred in specific transcripts. In addition, the sequences of GAI RNA are necessary and sufficient to target GREEN FLUORESCENT PROTEIN (GFP) RNA for long-distance movement, which indicates that the trafficking of GAI RNA is mediated by specific RNA motifs. Further analyses revealed that the motifs at coding sequences and 3' untranslated regions of GAI RNA play important roles during RNA movement. In addition, the structure of the RNA rather than its specific sequence may also be important in GAI RNA trafficking. However, the secondary structure of GAI RNA is not the only factor to target RNA for long-distance movement, because recovery of the secondary structure of movement-defective GAI RNA only partially rescued RNA movement. Taken together, our results show that long-distance movement of non-cell autonomous RNA operates by specific RNA mobile elements. 3a3' untranslated regions 3aArabidopsis 3agreen fluorescent protein 3anucleotide motifs 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 2aArabidopsisxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aArabidopsis Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aGene Expression Regulation, Plant 2aMutagenesis, Site-Directed 2aNucleic Acid Conformation 2aRNA Transport 2aRNA, Plantxmetabolism 0aRNA long-distance trafficking 0aRNA mobile element 0aGA-insensitive 0agrafting 0alinker scanning1 aYu, Tien-Shin0 tPlant journal.g2009 Sept., v. 59, no. 6 p.921-929dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0960-74127nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-313X.2009.03918.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20090911b20091106c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02018naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001500148245008100163300001200244520097500256592002801231650001401259650001401273650001501287650001901302650001001321650001701331650003701348650002801385700001301413700001501426700001201441773012401453856008201577852000901659655001201668IND60089467520221122124202.0141102e20111014xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008946752DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbrc.2011.09.0462doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Zi-yue10aMitochondrial ROS generation for regulation of autophagic pathways in cancer  ap. 5-8.  aMitochondria, the main source of reactive oxygen species (ROS), are required for cell survival; yet also orchestrate programmed cell death (PCD), referring to apoptosis and autophagy. Autophagy is an evolutionarily conserved lysosomal degradation process implicated in a wide range of pathological processes, most notably cancer. Accumulating evidence has recently revealed that mitochondria may generate massive ROS that play the essential role for autophagy regulation, and thus sealing the fate of cancer cell. In this review, we summarize mitochondrial function and ROS generation, and also highlight ROS-modulated core autophagic pathways involved in ATG4–ATG8/LC3, Beclin-1, p53, PTEN, PI3K–Akt–mTOR and MAPK signaling in cancer. Therefore, a better understanding of the intricate relationships between mitochondrial ROS and autophagy may ultimately allow cancer biologists to harness mitochondrial ROS-mediated autophagic pathways for cancer drug discovery.  aPublisher supplied data 3aapoptosis 3aautophagy 3abiologists 3acell viability 3adrugs 3amitochondria 3amitogen-activated protein kinase 3areactive oxygen species1 aYang, Yu1 aMing, Miao1 aLiu, Bo0 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2011 Oct. 14, v. 414, no. 1 p.5-8dElsevier Inc.x0006-291X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2011.09.0463Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02614naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001900148245014800167520106900315592002801384650001701412650001801429650002001447650001301467650001301480650001301493650002801506650004101534650001801575650001101593650001601604650001701620650001201637650002201649650003301671650002101704650001301725653002101738653001301759653002901772700003001801700002201831700002801853700002401881773012301905856008302028852000902111655001202120IND60705690820221119063631.0201024e202009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070569082DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bcab.2020.1017342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSaidi, Vahideh10aProfiling of bioactive metabolites during the ripening of a semi-hard non-starter culture cheese to detect functional dietary neurotransmitters  aIn the present study, the profile of bioactive metabolites in Lighvan cheese, a traditional Iranian semi-hard cheese produced with non-pasteurized ewes' milk and non-starter culture, was investigated during the ripening period to characterize the potential neurotransmitters. Lighvan cheese was prepared according to the local recipe and sampling was done at four stages of ripening (1, 60, 120 and 180 days). The metabolomics was monitored using gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) method and the obtained data were elaborated by principal component analysis (PCA). The results revealed that the content of gamma amino-butyric acid (GABA), glutamate, dopamine, and tyramine known as dietary neurotransmitters were elevated during the ripening process in Lighvan cheese mainly produced by Enterococci and Lactobacilli. Thus, the profile of metabolites of Lighvan cheese exhibited that Lighvan cheese could be a considerable source of dietary neurotransmitters.

Here we attempt a community-wide approach in the analysis of plant interactions, exploring whether in a semi-arid environment positive or negative interactions predominate and whether there are differences among co-occurring shrub species. Most shrubs in our plot exerted significant effects on their understorey communities, ranging from negative to positive. We found a clear case of interference and another case where the effect was neutral, but facilitation predominated and the biomass of annuals under most shrubs in our community was larger than in gaps. Effects on soil water and fertility were revealed as the primary source of facilitation; the build-up of soil organic matter changed soil physical properties and improved soil water relations. Facilitation by shrubs involved decoupling of soil temperature and moisture. Sheltering from direct radiation had an effect on productivity, but significant differences in understorey biomass did not parallel understorey light environment. A positive balance of the interaction among plants, essentially mediated by changes in soil properties, is the predominant outcome of plant interactions in this semi-arid community.Nomenclature: Castroviejo et al.

This paper revises our view of knowledge—developed during the mapping and planning processes—as the undisputed factual basis on which policy is developed. Rather, it argues that the construction, management, validation, and marginalisation of different types of knowledge stemming from different stakeholders or disciplinary approaches is at the heart of policy and planning processes. Using the case of fisheries-generated knowledge in the implementation of MSP, we contend that the fisheries data informing the MSP process are still very much streamlined to classical bio-economic metrics. Such metrics fall short of describing the plural and complex knowledges that comprise fisheries, such as localised social and cultural typologies, as well as the scale and dynamics, hence, providing incomplete information for the decision-making process of MSP. In this paper, we provide a way to move towards what we conceptualize as ‘Deep Knowledge’ and propose a model that brings together of the existing datasets and integrates socio-cultural data as well as complex spatiotemporal elements, to create dynamic rather than static datasets for MSP. We furthermore argue that the process of knowledge production and the building of the parameters of such datasets, should be based on effective stakeholder participation, whose futures depend on the plans that eventually result from MSP. Finally, we recommend that the ‘Deep Knowledge’ model is adopted to inform the process of knowledge production currently being undertaken in the diverse countries engaging in the MSP process. This will result in policies that truly reflect and address the complexities that characterise fisheries, and which are legitimized through a process of knowledge co-production.  aPublisher supplied data 3abioeconomics 3adata collection 3adecision making 3aissues and policy 3amodels 3astakeholders1 aTrouillet, Brice0 tMaritime studies.g2020 Sept., v. 19, no. 3 p.347-357dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:22889x1872-78597nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s40152-020-00178-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02528naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002100145245017100166300001800337520141700355592002801772650001201800650002301812650001301835650002301848650002201871650001401893650002201907650001701929650001601946700001901962773011901981856008102100852000902181655001202190IND60576389520221120165232.0170804e20170721xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057638952DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.joc.7b008162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNishinaga, Tohru10aStable Radical Cations and Their π-Dimers Prepared from Ethylene- and Propylene-3,4-dioxythiophene Co-oligomers: Combined Experimental and Theoretical Investigations  ap. 7245-7253.  aCo-oligomers composed of two 3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene (EDOT) units and two or three 3,4-propylenedioxythiophene (ProDOT) units, i.e., 2E2PEₜ and 2E3PEₜ, were newly synthesized together with the ProDOT trimer 3PMₑ. On the basis of cyclic voltammetry, the gaps between the first and second oxidation potentials (ΔE¹–²) of 2E2PEₜ and 2E3PEₜ were found to be larger than that of the previously synthesized ProDOT tetramer 4PHₑₓ. These co-oligomers gave the fairly stable radical cations 2E2PEₜ•⁺ and 2E3PEₜ•⁺ by chemical oxidation with AgSbF₆. The disproportionation of 2E2PEₜ•⁺ and 2E3PEₜ•⁺ into neutral and dicationic species, which was observed for 4PHₑₓ•⁺, was inhibited in accord with the larger ΔE¹–². Additionally, the formation of the π-dimers (3PMₑ)₂²⁺, (2E2PEₜ)₂²⁺, and (2E3PE)₂²⁺ was clearly observed in dichloromethane solution at low temperatures with UV–vis–NIR spectroscopy. Furthermore, the π-dimerization enthalpies of 2E2PEₜ•⁺ and 2E3PEₜ•⁺ were greater than that of 3PMₑ•⁺, suggesting the formation of fully π-contacted structures. The structures of the π-dimers were optimized at the B97D3 method, and the calculated absorption spectra of the π-dimers obtained using TD-DFT methods were in reasonable agreement with the observed ones, supporting the reliability of the calculated structures.  aPublisher supplied data 3acations 3achemical structure 3aenthalpy 3amethylene chloride 3aorganic chemistry 3aoxidation 3aspectral analysis 3aspectroscopy 3atemperature1 aSotome, Yusuke0 tJournal of organic chemistry.g2017 July 21, v. 82, no. 14 p.7245-7253dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-69047nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.joc.7b008163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04370naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004400094040001800138100001900156245007500175300001400250520258500264592002802849650002502877650001902902650003202921650001202953650002302965650001702988650001303005650002003018650001803038650002003056650001003076650000903086650001803095650001603113650003103129650001703160650002003177650001503197650001803212653001903230653003103249653002203280653003603302653005503338700002003393700002003413700002003433700002603453700002803479700003103507700001703538700002203555773009103577856009103668852000903759655001203768IND60637934620221122122005.0200804e201907  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063793462DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biomaterials.2019.04.0212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOthman, Ziryan14aThe role of ENPP1/PC-1 in osteoinduction by calcium phosphate ceramics  ap. 12-24.  aIn the past decade, calcium phosphate (CaP) ceramics have emerged as alternatives to autologous bone grafts for the treatment of large, critical-sized bone defects. In order to be effective in the regeneration of such defects, ceramics must show osteoinductive behaviour, defined as the ability to induce de novo heterotopic bone formation. While a set of osteoinductive CaP ceramics has been developed, the exact processes underlying osteoinduction, and the role of the physical and chemical properties of the ceramics, remain largely unknown. Previous studies have focused on the role of the transcriptome to shed light on the mechanism of osteoinduction at the mRNA level. To complement these studies, a proteomic analysis was performed to study the behaviour of hMSCs on osteoinductive and non-osteoinductive CaPs. The results of this analysis suggest that plasma cell glycoprotein 1 (PC-1), encoded by the ectonucleotide pyrophosphatase/phosphodiesterase 1 (ENPP1) gene, plays a key role in the process of osteoinduction by CaP ceramics. Validation experiments have confirmed that indeed, the mRNA expression of ENPP1 and the production of PC-1 are higher on osteoinductive than on non-osteoinductive CaP ceramics, a trend that was also observed for other osteogenic markers such as bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP2) and osteopontin (OPN), but not for alkaline phosphatase (ALP). Our results also showed that the expression of PC-1 is restricted to those cells which are in direct contact with the CaP ceramic surface, plausibly due to the localised depletion of calcium and inorganic phosphate ions from the supersaturated cell culture medium as CaP crystallises on the ceramic surface. Replicating the surface of the osteoinductive ceramic in polystyrene resulted in a significant decrease in ENPP1 expression, suggesting that surface structural properties alone are not sufficient to induce ENPP1 expression. Finally, knocking down ENPP1 expression in hMSCs resulted in increased BMP2 expression, both at the mRNA and protein level, suggesting that ENPP1 is a negative regulator of BMP-2 signalling. Taken together, this study shows, for the first time, that ENPP1/PC-1 plays an important role in CaP-induced osteogenic differentiation of hMSCs and thus possibly osteoinduction by CaP ceramics. Furthermore, we have identified a crucial role for the interfacial (chemical) events occurring on the CaP ceramic surface in the process of osteoinduction. This knowledge can contribute to the development of new bone graft substitutes, with improved osteoinductive potential.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalkaline phosphatase 3abone formation 3abone morphogenetic proteins 3acalcium 3acalcium phosphates 3acell culture 3aceramics 3acrystallization 3aculture media 3agene expression 3agenes 3aions 3amessenger RNA 3aosteopontin 3aphysicochemical properties 3apolystyrenes 3aprotein content 3aproteomics 3atranscriptome 0aOsteoinduction 0aCalcium phosphate ceramics 0aBone regeneration 0aHuman mesenchymal stromal cells 0aEctonucleotide pyrophosphatase/phosphodiesterase 11 aFernandes, Hugo1 aGroot, Arjan J.1 aLuider, Theo M.1 aAlcinesio, Alessandro1 aPereira, Daniel de Melo1 aGuttenplan, Alexander P.M.1 aYuan, Huipin1 aHabibovic, Pamela0 tBiomaterials.g2019 July, v. 210 p.12-24dElsevier LtdwJournal:11782x0142-96127nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biomaterials.2019.04.0213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02316naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001400152245007200166300001200238520110500250592002801355650001301383650004201396650001401438650001101452650001101463650002401474650002501498651001001523653002801533653001201561653004701573653002101620653002501641700001301666700001201679700001501691773010501706856008601811852000901897655001201906IND60606835320221122005918.0180730e20160615xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060683532DNAL7 a10.1016/j.atmosres.2016.01.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aY.B., Tan10aLightning flash density in relation to aerosol over Nanjing (China)  ap. 1-8.  aTime series data of lightning flash density, aerosol optical depth (AOD), surface temperature, convective available potential energy (CAPE) and thunderstorm days for 10years (2002–2011), cloud-to-ground lightning (CG), and AOD of 5years for summer season, i.e., June, July, and August over Nanjing, China, have been analyzed, to investigate the impact of aerosols on lightning. The results indicate that the radiative effect of aerosol may be one of the main reason for the decrease of the lightning flash density in a long period, while the aerosol microphysical effect may be a major role in the increase of the percent of +CG flashes (P+CG). The dependence of surface temperature, CAPE, and thunderstorm days on AOD (R=−0.748, −0.741, −0.744), and the negative correlation (R=−0.634) between lightning flash density and AOD may lend support for the radiative effect of aerosol on lightning. In addition, elevated aerosols may change the charge distribution in thundercloud, hence enhancing the positive cloud-to-ground lightning (+CG) activity, as P+CG is positively correlated with AOD.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaerosols 3aconvective available potential energy 3alightning 3astorms 3asummer 3asurface temperature 3atime series analysis 3aChina 0aLightning flash density 0aAerosol 0aPositive cloud-to-ground lightning flashes 0aRadiative effect 0aMicrophysical effect1 aL., Peng1 aZ., Shi1 aH.R., Chen0 tAtmospheric research.g2016 June 15, v. 174-175 p.1-8dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11823x0169-80957nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.atmosres.2016.01.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02503naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002600145245009900171300001800270520135100288592002801639650001501667650002301682650002301705650000901728650001101737650002701748650002201775650002201797650001601819700001701835700002901852700001801881700002101899773011901920856008102039852000902120655001202129IND60576389620221120155540.0170804e20170721xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057638962DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.joc.7b008312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSadowski, Bartłomiej10aπ-Expanded Dipyrrolonaphthyridinediones with Large Two-Photon Absorption Cross-Section Values  ap. 7254-7264.  aA synthetic entry to novel dyes based on the dipyrrolonaphthyridinedione core was developed via the Heck reaction. These weakly fluorescent compounds bearing double bond linkages between the core and the peripheral units absorbed strongly in the far-red/NIR region and possessed large values of two-photon absorption (TPA) cross-sections (up to 5180 GM). Additionally, analogous dyes bearing triple bond linkages were also efficient TPA materials with relatively large two-photon absorption cross-sections (up to 2840 GM) as well as two-photon brightness (up to 1450 GM). The centrosymmetric nature of both of these families of dyes is responsible for the location of the maxima of two-photon absorption being at much higher energy than the ones corresponding to the double wavelength of the lowest-energy one-photon absorption. Theoretical calculations clarified that the enhancement of the TPA by the peripheral substitutions arose through different mechanisms depending on either the electron-donating or electron-withdrawing ability of a given substituent to the ambipolar core. The change in the electron distribution of HOMO and HOMO–1 by the push–pull effect was found to govern the strength of the lowest-energy TPA-allowed transition. Importantly, compounds from both series possessed a beneficial ratio of σ₂/MW (1.6–9.8 GM/g).  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3achemical reactions 3achemical structure 3adyes 3aenergy 3afluorescent substances 3aorganic chemistry 3aorganic compounds 3awavelengths1 aKita, Hanayo1 aGrzybowski, M.q(Marek),1 aKamada, Kenji1 aGryko, Daniel T.0 tJournal of organic chemistry.g2017 July 21, v. 82, no. 14 p.7254-7264dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-69047nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.joc.7b008313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02382naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245013300158520142300291592002801714650002401742650001401766650001801780650001801798650003101816700002301847700001601870773012201886856007502008852000902083655001202092IND60768468120221120025251.0220225e20220215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076846812DNAL7 a10.3390/nu140408182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCho, Hae-Eun 10aEfficacy of Vitamin D Supplements in Prevention of Acute Respiratory Infection: A Meta-Analysis for Randomized Controlled Trials  aBackground: Previous systematic reviews and meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have reported inconsistent results regarding the efficacy of vitamin D supplements in the prevention of acute respiratory infections (ARIs). Methods: We investigated these efficacy results by using a meta-analysis of RCTs. We searched PubMed, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library in June 2021. Results: Out of 390 trials searched from the database, a total of 30 RCTs involving 30,263 participants were included in the final analysis. In the meta-analysis of all the trials, vitamin D supplementation showed no significant effect in the prevention of ARIs (relative risk (RR) 0.96, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.91–1.01, I² = 59.0%, n = 30). In the subgroup meta-analysis, vitamin D supplementation was effective in daily supplementation (RR 0.83, 95% CI, 0.73–0.95, I² = 69.1%, n = 15) and short-term supplementation (RR 0.83, 95% CI, 0.71–0.97, I² = 66.8%, n = 13). However, such beneficial effects disappeared in the subgroup meta-analysis of high-quality studies (RR 0.89, 95% CI, 0.78–1.02, I² = 67.0%, n = 10 assessed by the Jadad scale; RR 0.87, 95% CI, 0.66–1.15, I² = 51.0%, n = 4 assessed by the Cochrane’s risk of bias tool). Additionally, publication bias was observed. Conclusions: The current meta-analysis found that vitamin D supplementation has no clinical effect in the prevention of ARIs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aconfidence interval 3adatabases 3ameta-analysis 3arelative risk 3arespiratory tract diseases1 aMyung, Seung-Kwon 1 aCho, Herim 0 tNutrients.g2022 Feb. 15, v. 14, no. 4dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2271x2072-66437nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/nu140408183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03085naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245017600167300001400343520148900357592002801846650001001874650001801884650001501902650002001917650001601937650004301953650002101996650002302017650001302040650002702053650001402080650001302094650001902107650002702126650001302153653001802166653002702184653003402211653004302245653001602288700001202304700005602316700001202372773011302384856008502497852000902582655001202591IND60613731920221123044742.0200523e20180914xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061373192DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chroma.2018.07.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZheng, Sijie10aMelamine-based porous organic polymers inline solid phase extraction coupled with high performance liquid chromatography for the analysis of phytohormones in juice samples  ap. 64-72.  aA melamine-based porous organic polymer (mPMF) was synthesized as solid phase extraction (SPE) adsorbent for inline SPE-high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)-ultraviolet detector (UV) analysis of five phytohormones. Melamine contributed to the rich π-electron and N-containing triazine structure for mPMF, which could form π-π interaction and intermolecular hydrogen bond with COOH containing phytohormones. The synthesized mPMF adsorbent shows extremely high extraction efficiency for five target analytes (>80%) including salicylic acid, indole-3-acetic acid, abscisic acid, 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid and 1-naphthalene acetic acid. The factors affecting extraction of the target phytohormones were investigated and the optimized experimental conditions were established. The linear range was 0.2–100 μg/L with the limits of detection in the range of 0.06–0.11 μg/L for five target phytohormones. The developed method of mPMF-inline-SPE-HPLC-UV was applied for the analysis of trace target phytohormones in tomato and grape juice samples, and the recovery in the range of 83.1–116% and 87.2–121% was obtained for the spiked tomato and grape juice, respectively. This method has the advantages of high sensitivity and good reproducibility, and it has good application potential for the analysis of phytohormones in fruit samples. Moreover, inline analysis avoided the problems of sample pollution and sample loss, and provided a sample throughput of 5/h.  aPublisher supplied data 3a2,4-D 3aabscisic acid 3aadsorbents 3adetection limit 3agrape juice 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3ahydrogen bonding 3aindole acetic acid 3amelamine 3anaphthaleneacetic acid 3apollution 3apolymers 3asalicylic acid 3asolid phase extraction 3atomatoes 0aPhytohormones 0aPorous organic polymer 0aInline solid phase extraction 0aHigh performance liquid chromatography 0aFruit juice1 aHe, Man1 aChen, Beibei1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7772-51711 aHu, Bin0 tJournal of chromatography.g2018 Sept. 14, v. 1567 p.64-72dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl50504x0021-96737nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chroma.2018.07.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03472naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100001900166245010600185300001600291520169500307592002802002650002002030650002102050650001702071650003502088650001202123650002202135650001602157650001502173650001002188650001302198650001302211650001502224650003202239650004402271650003702315650002402352650003602376650006002412650001902472650002302491650004002514650005802554650002102612650002802633650003002661700002502691700002002716773012502736856004802861852000902909655001202918IND50062372220221120202150.0130322e201302  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006237222DNAL7 a232079812pmid7 a10.1007/s10295-012-1218-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEberly, Jed O.10aPhysiological characterization of lipid accumulation and in vivo ester formation in Gordonia sp. KTR9  ap. 201-208.  aPrevious work has demonstrated the feasibility of in vivo biodiesel synthesis in Escherichia coli, however, ethyl ester formation was dependent on an external fatty acid feedstock. In contrast to E. coli, actinomycetes may be ideal organisms for direct biodiesel synthesis because of their capacity to synthesize high levels of triacylglcerides (TAGs). In this study, we investigated the physiology and associated TAG accumulation along with the in vivo ability to catalyze ester formation from exogenous short chain alcohol sources in Gordonia sp. KTR9, a strain that possesses a large number of genes dedicated to fatty acid and lipid biosynthesis. Total lipid fatty acids content increased by 75 % and TAG content increased by 50 % under nitrogen starvation conditions in strain KTR9. Strain KTR9 tolerated the exogenous addition of up to 4 % methanol, 4 % ethanol and 2 % propanol in the media. Increasing alcohol concentrations resulted in a decrease in the degree of saturation of recovered fatty acid alcohol esters and a slight increase in the fatty acid chain length. A linear dose dependency in fatty alcohol ester synthesis was observed in the presence of 0.5–2 % methanol and ethanol compared to control KTR9 strains grown in the absence of alcohols. An inspection of the KTR9 genome revealed the presence of several putative wax ester synthase/acyl-coenzyme A : diacylglycerol acyltransferase (WS/DGAT) enzymes, encoded by atf gene homologs, that may catalyze the in vivo synthesis of fatty acid esters from short chain alcohols. Collectively, these results indicate that Gordonia sp. KTR9 may be a suitable actinomycete host strain for in vivo biodiesel synthesis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aActinomycetales 3aEscherichia coli 3abiosynthesis 3adiacylglycerol acyltransferase 3aethanol 3afatty acid esters 3afatty acids 3afeedstocks 3agenes 3amethanol 3anitrogen 3astarvation 2aAcyl Coenzyme Axmetabolism 2aAcyltransferasesxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aAlcoholsxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aBiofuelsxsupply & distribution 2aDiacylglycerol O-Acyltransferasexgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aEsterification 2aEstersxmetabolism 2aFatty Acidsxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aGordonia Bacteriumxenzymologyxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aLipid Metabolism 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aTriglyceridesxmetabolism1 aRingelberg, David B.1 aIndest, Karl J.0 tJournal of industrial microbiology & biotechnology.g2013 Feb., v. 40, no. 2 p.201-208dSpringer-Verlagx1367-54357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10295-012-1218-6  aDNAL 7aarticle02275naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094024002200121024001900143040001800162100002300180245008900203300001800292506007600310520089000386592002801276506003701304650001101341650000901352650002201361650002201383650001701405650002701422650003001449650001501479700001501494700001801509700002301527700002301550700002001573700002001593700002201613773011001635856007501745852000901820655001201829IND60529569920221207110436.0160717e20130205xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052956992DNAL7 a10.1021/ac30315272doi7 aPMC35657502pmcid7 a233052382pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCatherman, Adam D.10aTop Down Proteomics of Human Membrane Proteins from Enriched Mitochondrial Fractions  ap. 1880-1888.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe interrogation of intact integral membrane proteins has long been a challenge for biological mass spectrometry. Here, we demonstrate the application of top down mass spectrometry to whole membrane proteins below 60 kDa with up to 8 transmembrane helices. Analysis of enriched mitochondrial membrane preparations from human cells yielded identification of 83 integral membrane proteins, along with 163 membrane-associated or soluble proteins, with a median q value of 3 × 10–¹⁰. An analysis of matching fragment ions demonstrated that significantly more fragment ions were found within transmembrane domains than would be expected based upon the observed protein sequence. In total, 46 proteins from the complexes of oxidative phosphorylation were identified which exemplifies the increasing ability of top down proteomics to provide extensive coverage in a biological network.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3ahumans 3aions 3amass spectrometry 3amembrane proteins 3amitochondria 3amitochondrial membrane 3aoxidative phosphorylation 3aproteomics1 aLi, Mingxi1 aTran, John C.1 aDurbin, Kenneth R.1 aCompton, Philip

The antibacterial potential of the test compounds was investigated against Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and two methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) strains (MRSA10, MRSA11), where compound 6 showed the best results. For brine shrimp lethality bioassay (BSLB), compound 6 again showed up to 100% mortality at 200 μg/mL and 56.7% mortality at 6.25 μg/mL. Antileishmanial assay was performed against Leishmania tropica at 20 μg/mL dosage, where 6 showed the most promising activity with 16.26% survival (83.74% mortality; IC₅₀=14.63 μg/mL). The anticancer potential of the selected benzimidazole derivatives was evaluated against two selected cell lines (human colorectal cancer, HCT-116 and breast adenocarcinoma, MCF-7) using sulforhodamine B (SRB) assay. Compound 6 was found to be the most effective cytotoxic compound with 75% inhibition of HCT-116 proliferation at 1 mg/mL concentration. Succinctly, 6 exhibited impressive pharmacological potential that might be attributed to its higher lipophilic character owing to the longer N-substituted alkyl chains when compared to the other test compounds.  aDr. Muhammad Adnan Iqbal is thankful to the Higher Education Commission of Pakistan, Funder Id: 10.13039/501100004681 (HEC) for Start up Research Grant (SRGP) Project Number 1085/Letter Number 21-1085/SRGP/R&D.  aPublisher supplied data  a1085 3aArtemia 3aLeishmania tropica 3aPseudomonas aeruginosa 3aadenocarcinoma 3aantibacterial properties 3aantioxidant activity 3aantioxidants 3abenzimidazole 3abioassays 3abreasts 3acell lines 3acolorectal neoplasms 3acytotoxicity 3adeath 3ahumans 3alipophilicity 3amethicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus 3amortality 3asalts 0aantileishmanial assay 0aantioxidant assay 0abenzimidazole derivatives 0abenzimidazolium salts 0abrine shrimp lethality bioassay1 aIslam, Shamsul1 aZia, Muhammad1 aWilliam, Kainaat1 aAbbas, Fakhar i1 aUmar, Muhammad Ihtisham1 aIqbal, Muhammad Adnan1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6241-75471 aMannan, Abdul0 tZeitschrift für Naturforschung.g2018 Dec. 19, v. 74, no. 1-2 p.17-23dDe GruyterwJournal:23183x1865-71257nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1515/znc-2018-00953Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02277naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245007400164300001400238520116000252592002801412650001801440650001501458650001201473650001101485650001201496650002201508653002101530653002801551653002701579653001901606653001601625773019501641856008201836852000901918655001201927IND60583250820221122163158.0190411e201712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058325082DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jfe.2017.08.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPrice, Colin10aOptimal rotation with negative discount rates: completing the picture  ap. 87-93.  aWhile the rotation of maximum forest rent (no discounting of revenues and costs) is sometimes discussed conceptually and calculated practically, forest economists have almost invariably focused on optimal rotation with a positive discount rate. Some circumstances, especially related to increasing marginal utility with decreasing availability per head of products, would justify use of a negative discount rate. For a logically complete suite of conditions, a means of identifying optimal rotation with such a rate is needed. Applying the usual formulation for land expectation value then produces a meaningless result. Two approaches seem to give a solution. One uses the first-order conditions for an optimum. Another uses inversion of time perspective to produce sensible-seeming results. However, for cases where the world, or the value of forest production, ends suddenly at an unpredictable time, the optimal rotation is, surprisingly, that of maximum forest rent. Where the cause of negative discount rates is of limited duration before stability or growing affluence is re-established, this “provisional optimum” can be modified responsively.  aPublisher supplied data 3adiscount rate 3aeconomists 3aforests 3aincome 3aleasing 3atimber production 0aoptimal rotation 0anegative discount rates 0aland expectation value 0aterminal value 0aforest rent0 tJournal of forest economics.g2017 Dec., v. 29 p.87-93dElsevier GmbHaDepartment of Forest Economics, Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences, UmeåwJournal:jnl3660850x1104-68997nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jfe.2017.08.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03090naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100005800150245014700208520159800355592002801953650001901981650000902000650002202009650001002031650002102041650000702062650001502069650005002084650002202134650001302156650002502169650001502194650001002209653000902219653002102228653001802249653003602267700001302303700001502316700002202331700001902353700005802372773009602430856008502526852000902611655001202620IND60731343820221120235703.0220103e20210515xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073134382DNAL7 a10.1016/j.watres.2021.1170462doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Guoyang1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7593-318810aKey structural features that determine the selectivity of UV/acetylacetone for the degradation of aromatic pollutants when compared to UV/H2O2  aAcetylacetone (AA) has proven to be a potent photo-activator for the decolorization of dyes. However, there is very limited information on the quantitative structure–activity relationship (QSAR) and the mechanisms of dye degradation by UV/AA. Herein, the photolysis of 65 aromatic compounds (dyes and dye precursors) was investigated at three pH values (4.0, 6.0, 9.0) by UV/AA and UV/H₂O₂. The obtained pseudo-first-order photodegradation rate constants (k₁) were processed using statistical analysis. The correlation between the k₁ values and the number of photons absorbed by AA, together with the observed pH effect, suggested that the protonated enol structure of AA plays a crucial role in the photodecolorization of dyes. According to quantum chemical computation, photo-induced direct electron transfer between the excited state of AA and the dye was the main mechanism in the UV/AA process. QSAR models demonstrated that the molecular size and stability were the key factors that determined the efficiency of UV/H₂O₂ for dye degradation. Statistically, the UV/AA process was target-selective and suffered less from the inner filter effect, which made it more effective than the UV/H₂O₂ process for dye degradation. The selectivity of the UV/AA process was mainly embodied in the substituent effects: dyes with hydroxyl groups in conjugated systems decomposed faster than those with nitro-substitution or ortho-substituted sulfonate groups. The results can be used for the selection of appropriate photochemical approaches for the treatment of dye-contaminated water.  aPublisher supplied data 3adecolorization 3adyes 3aelectron transfer 3aenols 3amolecular weight 3apH 3aphotolysis 3aquantitative structure-activity relationships 3aquantum mechanics 3aresearch 3astatistical analysis 3asulfonates 3awater 0aDyes 0aPhotodegradation 0aAcetylacetone 0aStructure-activity relationship1 aXie, Min1 aZhao, Jing1 aWei, Shuangshuang1 aZheng, Hongcen1 aZhang, Shujuan1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5013-54380 tWater research.g2021 May 15, v. 196 p.117046-dElsevier LtdwJournal:1966x0043-13547nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.watres.2021.1170463Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02455naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002100148245013200169520096700301592002801268650002201296650001201318650001601330650001901346650001701365650001901382650001101401650001301412650002001425650002001445650001001465650001301475650001201488650001601500650001801516650001801534650002501552650001901577650001601596650001401612650002101626651001101647653001901658653001601677653001001693700001901703773012301722856008301845852000901928655001201937IND60705691220221119063302.0201024e202009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070569122DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bcab.2020.1017172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHadibarata, Tony10aBiodegradation of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons by high-laccase basidiomycetes fungi isolated from tropical forest of Borneo  aA total of 804 fungi isolate were subjected to the screening of high laccase activity by four different indicators test, Poly R-478, RBBR, guaiacol, and syringaldazine.

Damming interrupts the continuity of the river and produces the flooding of adjacent terrestrial ecosystems. Despite the negative effects on terrestrial and aquatic biodiversity, studies of the impacts of hydroelectric dams on species and community functional responses to flooding are scarce. Here, we evaluated the effects of river damming on taxonomic and functional diversity of phyllostomid bats sampled before (flooded sites) and after (unflooded sites) the construction of a mega hydroelectric dam in the southwestern of the Brazilian Amazon. The flooding of the lowlands significantly increased the taxonomic and functional α-diversity, as well as the species- and the community-level functional uniqueness of the bat assemblages, reflecting a reduction in the abundance of functional redundant species. Based on functional trait composition, we detected an increase in the frequency of animalivorous bats, and a reduction in phytophagous bats. Pre- and post-dam temporal differences show that functional β-diversity shifts were more determined by replacement of traits weighted by species abundance than by the loss or gain of traits. Functional traits linked to trophic level, body mass, and diet proved to be powerful indicators of the bat community’s responses to temporal changes caused by run-of-the-river dams, which degrade riparian and várzea forests. Plans to expand the electric power matrix in Brazil include the construction of several dams, potentially flooding large areas of várzea forests. We demonstrate the importance of the várzea and the riparian forests to phytophagous bats to guarantee the ecological functions they perform.  aPublisher supplied data  a88887.370067/2019-0cCoordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior 3aChiroptera 3abody weight 3adams (hydrology) 3adiet 3aelectric power 3afunctional diversity 3ahabitats 3arivers 3aspecies abundance 3atrophic levels 3aAmazonia 3aBrazil1 aFarneda, Fábio Z.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6765-28611 aNobre, Carla Clarissa1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2704-62391 ada Cunha Tavares, Valéria1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0966-01390 tBiodiversity and conservation.g2022 Mar., v. 31, no. 4 p.1359-1377dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl50341x0960-31157nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10531-022-02396-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02660naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100002800137245009000165300001600255520125900271592002801530650002401558650001701582650001301599650001501612650001201627650001601639650002101655650002301676650001901699650002301718650001101741650001501752650002201767650001501789650001501804653002201819653002401841653003201865653002101897700002501918700001901943700002701962773010901989856007102098852000902169655001202178IND60549085520221119211003.0160906s2016    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054908552DNAL7 a10.1071/WF151942doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZuloaga-Aguilar, Susana10aResponse of soil seed bank to a prescribed burning in a subtropical pine–oak forest  ap. 946-954.  aPrescribed burning is a management instrument applied to reduce the risk of fire and favour revegetation. Our objective was to generate information about the dynamics of post-fire regeneration via the soil seed bank (SSB), for fire management in subtropical forests. Samples taken at soil depths of 0–3cm, 3–6cm and 6–10cm before and 5h after a prescribed burn showed that the fire immediately increased the number of germinable seeds and species in a Mexican pine–oak forest. Most of the germinable seeds were from species in genera with small seeds exhibiting physical or physiological dormancy, and that are tolerant or require fire for germination. Fire increased the number of germinable seeds during the wet season and the number of species was greater in the area control at 0–6-cm soil depth after 1 year; so that the fire modified the SSB seasonal pattern. Species diversity was not altered and was dominated by perennial herbaceous and shrub species both before and 2 years after the fire. Although fire completely eliminated the aboveground biomass of the understorey vegetation, the SSB can promote regeneration and persistence of understorey vegetation following a prescribed surface fire of low severity for the ecosystem studied.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaboveground biomass 3aburied seeds 3adormancy 3aecosystems 3aforests 3agermination 3aland restoration 3aprescribed burning 3arisk reduction 3aseasonal variation 3ashrubs 3asoil depth 3aspecies diversity 3aunderstory 3awet season 0aexperimental fire 0aforest regeneration 0aseed bank seasonal dynamics 0aseed germination1 aOrozco Segovia, Alma1 aBriones, Oscar1 aPelaez, Enrique Jardel0 tInternational journal of wildland fire.g2016, v. 25, no. 9 p.946-954dCSIRO Publishingx1049-80017nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1071/WF151943Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02671naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002400149245006500173300001600238500001900254520104500273592002801318650001001346650003401356650001101390650003001401650001901431650001301450650001301463651001401476651001001490651000901500651002101509651001401530651002501544651001801569651001201587653001001599653001601609653001101625700002201636700002201658700002101680700002601701700002501727700002001752700001901772700002201791700002101813700002001834700002301854773008901877856008301966990002302049852000902072655001202081IND60697509520221119110551.0200605e201611  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069750952DNAL7 a10.1016/j.virol.2016.08.0332doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMabvakure, Batsirai10aOngoing geographical spread of Tomato yellow leaf curl virus  ap. 257-264.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aTomato yellow leaf curl virus (TYLCV) seriously impacts tomato production throughout tropical and sub-tropical regions of the world. It has a broad geographical distribution and continues to spread to new regions in the Indian and Pacific Oceans including Australia, New Caledonia and Mauritius. We undertook a temporally-scaled, phylogeographic analysis of all publicly available, full genome sequences of TYLCV, together with 70 new genome sequences from Australia, Iran and Mauritius. This revealed that whereas epidemics in Australia and China likely originated through multiple independent viral introductions from the East-Asian region around Japan and Korea, the New Caledonian epidemic was seeded by a variant from the Western Mediterranean region and the Mauritian epidemic by a variant from the neighbouring island of Reunion. Finally, we show that inter-continental scale movements of TYLCV to East Asia have, at least temporarily, ceased, whereas long-distance movements to the Americas and Australia are probably still ongoing.  aPublisher supplied data 3aJapan 3aTomato yellow leaf curl virus 3agenome 3ageographical distribution 3aphylogeography 3atomatoes 3avirology 3aAustralia 3aChina 3aIran 3aKorean Peninsula 3aMauritius 3aMediterranean region 3aNew Caledonia 3aReunion 0aTYLCV 0aGeminivirus 0aTomato1 aMartin, Darren P.1 aKraberger, Simona1 aCloete, Leendert1 avan Brunschot, Sharon1 aGeering, Andrew D.W.1 aThomas, John E.1 aBananej, Kaveh1 aLett, Jean-Michel1 aLefeuvre, Pierre1 aVarsani, Arvind1 aHarkins, Gordon W.0 tVirology.g2016 Nov., v. 498 p.257-264dElsevier Inc.wJournal:2802x0042-68227nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.virol.2016.08.0333Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03256naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245014000169300001400309520183900323592002802162650003502190650002102225650001302246650001902259650002002278650001702298650001702315651001102332653001202343653001902355653002002374653003002394653003002424653001102454700002402465700002402489700002202513700005902535700002602594773009602620856008502716852000902801655001202810IND60637934920221122224529.0190516e201906  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063793492DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apgeog.2019.04.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLópez, Sonia,10aPrioritization to protect springs for public urban water supplies, based on multi-criteria evaluation and GIS (State of Mexico, Mexico)  ap. 26-37.  aThe problematic that commonly arises when protecting springs that supply water for human consumption requires a methodological process to prioritize springs that are used for this purpose according to their greatest need for protection from contamination and exploitation processes. To this end, the stages included in the present study were: a) regionalization of the study area (State of Mexico, Mexico) considering physical variables, which included precipitation, hydrogeological functioning, and geoforms; b) selection of the springs used for human supply that have the greatest exploitation flows, as registered in the Public Water Rights Record; and c) prioritization of springs to be protected based on a multi-criteria evaluation (MCE), considering criteria such as exploitation flow, land use, population to be supplied, conservation of spring water collection systems, existence of alternative supply sources, and marginalization index of nearby populations. Regionalization enabled identifying regions that were homogeneous in terms of the characteristics of the springs and their physical environment. Six of those regions with the largest territorial areas were selected, where 88% of the springs used for human consumption were located. Within each selected region, the springs that were representative of exploitation flow were identified, and a total of 23 were included. Lastly, MCE permit to identify six springs (one in each region) that were priorities for protection. The prioritization of the springs to be protected in each of the six regions selected will facilitate the future application of protection methods based on the physical characteristics of the springs and their physical and socioeconomic environments. Considering also the characteristics of groundwater flow in the feeding areas of the springs.  aPublisher supplied data 3ageographic information systems 3agroundwater flow 3aland use 3aprioritization 3asprings (water) 3awater rights 3awater supply 3aMexico 0aSprings 0aDrinking water 0aRegionalization 0aMulti-criteria evaluation 0aProtection of groundwater 0aMexico1 aExpósito, José L.1 aEsteller, María V.1 aGómez, Miguel A.1 aFranco, Roberto1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3031-65621 aMorales, Guillermo P.0 tApplied geography.g2019 June, v. 107 p.26-37dElsevier LtdwJournal:11785x0143-62287nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apgeog.2019.04.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02925naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001600151245010700167300001600274520137300290592002801663650001501691650001801706650001701724650001701741650002001758650002101778650001501799650001701814650001201831650002001843650001801863650001601881650001401897650001901911650002001930650001501950650001301965653003101978653001902009653001202028653001402040653001402054653002802068700001702096700001902113700001602132700001502148700002002163773009402183856008502277852000902362655001202371IND50061777620221120045912.0161020e20130220xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006177762DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jbiotec.2012.03.0142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBäcker, M.10aChip-based amperometric enzyme sensor system for monitoring of bioprocesses by flow-injection analysis  ap. 371-376.  aA microfluidic chip integrating amperometric enzyme sensors for the detection of glucose, glutamate and glutamine in cell-culture fermentation processes has been developed. The enzymes glucose oxidase, glutamate oxidase and glutaminase were immobilized by means of cross-linking with glutaraldehyde on platinum thin-film electrodes integrated within a microfluidic channel. The biosensor chip was coupled to a flow-injection analysis system for electrochemical characterization of the sensors. The sensors have been characterized in terms of sensitivity, linear working range and detection limit. The sensitivity evaluated from the respective peak areas was 1.47, 3.68 and 0.28μAs/mM for the glucose, glutamate and glutamine sensor, respectively. The calibration curves were linear up to a concentration of 20mM glucose and glutamine and up to 10mM for glutamate. The lower detection limit amounted to be 0.05mM for the glucose and glutamate sensor, respectively, and 0.1mM for the glutamine sensor. Experiments in cell-culture medium have demonstrated a good correlation between the glutamate, glutamine and glucose concentrations measured with the chip-based biosensors in a differential-mode and the commercially available instrumentation. The obtained results demonstrate the feasibility of the realized microfluidic biosensor chip for monitoring of bioprocesses.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiosensors 3abiotechnology 3acell culture 3acrosslinking 3adetection limit 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrodes 3afermentation 3aglucose 3aglucose oxidase 3aglutamic acid 3aglutaminase 3aglutamine 3aglutaraldehyde 3ainstrumentation 3amonitoring 3aplatinum 0aAmperometric enzyme sensor 0aBiosensor chip 0aGlucose 0aGlutamate 0aGlutamine 0aFlow-injection analysis1 aRakowski, D.1 aPoghossian, A.1 aBiselli, M.1 aWagner, P.1 aSchöning, M.J.0 tJournal of biotechnology.g2013 Feb. 20, v. 163 p.371-376dElsevier B.V.x0168-16567nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jbiotec.2012.03.0143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02732naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100006000152245015800212520113700370592002801507650001701535650002601552650001501578650001001593650001201603650002301615650002001638650001501658650002001673650001401693650001201707650001301719650002101732650002301753650001101776650001101787650001801798653002001816653001201836653002001848653001201868653002901880653001701909700002001926700001901946700002001965700002101985773010002006856008702106852000902193655001202202IND60696066420221119032617.0200607e20201015xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069606642DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2020.1270782doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAbdollahi, Mehdi1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1775-315910aMinimizing lipid oxidation during pH-shift processing of fish by-products by cross-processing with lingonberry press cake, shrimp shells or brown seaweed  aThe potential of cross-processing herring or salmon by-products with brown seaweed, shrimp peeling by-products and lingonberry press cake (called “helpers”) to minimize lipid oxidation during acid/alkaline pH-shift protein isolation was evaluated. Lingonberry press cake remarkably reduced levels of lipid hydroperoxides, malondialdehyde (MDA) and 4-hydroxy-trans2-hexenal (HHE) in both herring and salmon protein isolates (PI) while seaweed and shrimp by-product mitigated generation of MDA and HHE in herring PI. The salmon PI, however, by itself had very low oxidation levels. Cross-processing reduced protein yield compared with the classical pH-shift process by diminishing protein solubility, but still, the alkaline process version was promising. The color of the PIs varied greatly between different process combinations, reflecting partitioning of natural pigments into isolates. Altogether, cross-processing seems a promising tool for inhibition of lipid oxidation during pH-shift processing of sensitive fish by-products, with the alkaline version and lingonberry press cake being closest at hand for further studies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPhaeophyceae 3aVaccinium vitis-idaea 3abyproducts 3acolor 3aherring 3alipid peroxidation 3alipid peroxides 3amacroalgae 3amalondialdehyde 3aoxidation 3apeeling 3apigments 3aprotein isolates 3aprotein solubility 3asalmon 3ashrimp 3ashrimp shells 0apH-shift method 0aProtein 0aLipid oxidation 0aSeaweed 0aAgricultural by-products 0aShrimp peels1 aOlofsson, Ellen1 aZhang, Jingnan1 aAlminger, Marie1 aUndeland, Ingrid0 tFood chemistry.g2020 Oct. 15, v. 327 p.127078-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl8139x0308-81467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2020.1270783Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03113naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100001700142245006000159300001600219520167400235592002801909650001501937650002301952650002001975650001701995650001902012650003502031650001202066650002302078650001202101650001502113650001602128650001102144650001702155650001202172650002202184650001702206650002102223650001602244653001202260653002202272653003202294700002002326700001902346700002202365773013402387856007702521852000902598655001202607IND60480959020221119114856.0200226e20130801xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6048095902DNAL7 a10.3920/WMJ2013.15962doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSantos, R.R.10aMycotoxins and female reproduction: in vitro approaches  ap. 245-253.  aExposure to mycotoxins has been linked to adverse effects on female reproduction by interfering with the synthesis, metabolism or degradation of steroid hormones, interaction with steroid receptors or impairing oocyte maturation and competence. To assess such effects, many studies initially focussed on possible endocrine actions of mycotoxins using specific cell lines known to express key enzymes involved in the synthesis of steroid hormones. Using these models, zearalenone, deoxynivalenol, ochratoxin A, T-2 and HT-2 toxins, and aflatoxin B₁ were claimed to be endocrine active substances. As yet, zearalenone is the only mycotoxin for which a direct interaction with oestrogen receptors could be demonstrated, classifying this mycotoxin as an endocrine disruptor. Mycotoxin exposure of complex cell systems like ovarian follicles at the earliest (primordial) to most advanced (pre-ovulatory) stages can serve not only as the first indication of the potential of a mycotoxin to affect female reproduction, but also provides insight in specific mechanisms involved in such an effect and identifies vulnerable phases in follicle development. Zearalenone is the most widely studied mycotoxin regarding female reproduction, but effects on oocyte maturation have also been demonstrated for deoxynivalenol. Exposure to zearalenone impairs the formation of primordial, while its metabolite ?-zearalenol is more harmful to fertilised oocytes than zearalenone itself. This short overview aims to provide an introduction into the different models, such as cell lines and oocytes, commonly used to assess the potential adverse effects of mycotoxins on female reproduction.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHT-2 toxin 3aactive ingredients 3aadverse effects 3aaflatoxin B1 3adeoxynivalenol 3aendocrine-disrupting chemicals 3aenzymes 3aestrogen receptors 3afemales 3ametabolism 3ametabolites 3amodels 3aochratoxin A 3aoocytes 3aovarian follicles 3areproduction 3asteroid hormones 3azearalenone 0aoocytes 0aovarian follicles 0aendocrine active mycotoxins1 aSchoevers, E.J.1 aRoelen, B.A.J.1 aFink-Gremmels, J.0 tWorld mycotoxin journal.g2013 Aug. 1, v. 6, no. 3 p.245-253dWageningen Academic PublisherswJournal:jnl4395724x1875-07967nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3920/WMJ2013.15963Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02920naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004300111040001800154100003200172245011600204300001600320520135600336592002801692650001501720650001601735650001301751650001701764650002701781650001901808650001001827650002101837650001201858650001501870650002301885650003301908650003101941650003501972650002902007650002202036650002002058650003102078650002102109651001002130700002202140700001902162700001802181700002202199773008302221856008902304852000902393655001202402IND4466582420221120232618.0141110e201210  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446658242DNAL7 a228180892pmid7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2012.06.0302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMallampati, Srinivasa Reddy10aEnhanced heavy metal immobilization in soil by grinding with addition of nanometallic Ca/CaO dispersion mixture  ap. 717-723.  aThis study investigated the use of a nanometallic Ca and CaO dispersion mixture for the immobilization of heavy metals (As, Cd, Cr and Pb) in contaminated soil. Simple grinding achieved 85–90% heavy metal immobilization, but it can be enhanced further to 98–100% by addition of a nanometallic Ca/CaO dispersion mixture produced by grinding. Observations using SEM-EDS elemental maps and semi-quantitative analysis showed that the amounts of As, Cd, Cr, and Pb measurable on the soil particle surface decrease after nanometallic Ca/CaO treatment. The leachable heavy metal concentrations were reduced after nanometallic Ca/CaO treatment to concentrations lower than the Japan soil elution standard regulatory threshold: <0.01mgL⁻¹ for As, Cd, and Pb; and 0.05mgL⁻¹ for Cr. Effects of soil moisture and pH on heavy metal immobilization were not strongly influenced. The most probable mechanisms for the enhancement of heavy metal immobilization capacity with nanometallic Ca/CaO treatment might be due to adsorption and entrapment of heavy metals into newly formed aggregates, thereby prompting aggregation of soil particles and enclosure/binding with Ca/CaO-associated immobile salts. Results suggest that the nanometallic Ca/CaO mixture is suitable for use in immobilization of heavy-metal-contaminated soil under normal moisture conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3adispersions 3agrinding 3aheavy metals 3aimmobilization in soil 3apolluted soils 3asalts 3asoil aggregation 3asoil pH 2aAdsorption 2aCalciumxchemistry 2aCalcium Compoundsxchemistry 2aHydrogen-Ion Concentration 2aMetal Nanoparticlesxchemistry 2aMetals, Heavyxchemistry 2aOxidesxchemistry 2aSoilxchemistry 2aSoil Pollutantsxchemistry 2aWaterxchemistry 3aJapan1 aMitoma, Yoshiharu1 aOkuda, Tetsuji1 aSakita, Shogo1 aKakeda, Mitsunori0 tChemosphere.g2012 Oct., v. 89, no. 6 p.717-723dElsevier Ltdx0045-65357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2012.06.0303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03729naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005300148245009100201300001800292520184100310592002802151596009102179650002302270650002302293650000902316650002502325650001602350650002102366650001402387650002502401650001702426650001602443650003502459650001402494650001502508650001202523650001302535650001802548650002002566650001902586650002602605650000902631650001602640650001202656650001302668653002502681653001402706653002302720653001902743653002002762653002402782700001702806700001502823700001802838700001902856700001402875773011002889856008302999852000903082655001203091IND60677655420221116232322.0200911e201912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067765542DNAL7 a10.1094/PHYTO-01-19-0032-R2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPeng, Qin1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7710-463910aPoint Mutations in the β-Tubulin of Phytophthora sojae Confer Resistance to Ethaboxam  ap. 2096-2106.  aEthaboxam is a β-tubulin inhibitor registered for the control of oomycete pathogens. The current study was established to determine the ethaboxam sensitivity of the plant pathogen Phytophthora sojae and investigate the potential for the emergence of fungicide resistance. The effective concentration for 50% inhibition (EC₅₀) of 112 Phytophthora sojae isolates exhibited a unimodal distribution with a mean EC₅₀ for ethaboxam of 0.033 µg/ml. Establishing this baseline sensitivity provided critical data for monitoring changes in ethaboxam-sensitivity in field populations. The potential for fungicide resistance was investigated using adaptation on ethaboxam-amended V8 agar, which resulted in the isolation of 20 resistant mutants. An assessment of the biological characteristics of the mutants including mycelial growth, sporulation, germination rate and pathogenicity indicated that the resistance risk in Phytophthora sojae was low to medium with no cross-resistance between ethaboxam and cymoxanil, metalaxyl, flumorph, and oxathiapiprolin being detected. However, positive cross-resistance was found between ethaboxam and zoxamide for Q8L and I258V but negative cross-resistance for C165Y. Further investigation revealed that the ethaboxam-resistant mutants had point mutations at amino acids Q8L, C165Y, or I258V of their β-tubulin protein sequences. CRISPR/Cas9-mediated transformation experiments confirmed that the Q8L, C165Y, or I258V mutations could confer ethaboxam resistance in Phytophthora sojae and that the C165Y mutation induces high levels of resistance. Taken together, the results of the study provide essential data for monitoring the emergence of resistance and resistance management strategies for ethaboxam, as well as for improving the design of novel β-tubulin inhibitors for future development.  aPublisher supplied data  a2018YFD0201000a2017YFD0201602cNational Key Research and Development Program of China 3aCRISPR-Cas systems 3aPhytophthora sojae 3aagar 3aamino acid sequences 3aamino acids 3across resistance 3acymoxanil 3afungicide resistance 3agene editing 3agermination 3amedian effective concentration 3ametalaxyl 3amonitoring 3amutants 3amycelium 3apathogenicity 3aplant pathogens 3apoint mutation 3aresistance management 3arisk 3asporulation 3atubulin 3azoxamide 0aβ-tubulin inhibitor 0aethaboxam 0aPhytophthora sojae 0apoint mutation 0aresistance risk 0aresistant mechanism1 aWang, Zhiwen1 aFang, Yuan1 aWang, Weizhen1 aCheng, Xingkai1 aLiu, Xili0 tPhytopathology.g2019 Dec., v. 109, no. 12 p.2096-2106dPhytopathologywJournal:jnl44575x0031-949X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1094/PHYTO-01-19-0032-R3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02269naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002100140245012200161300002000283520122300303592002801526650001801554650001401572650001601586650001201602650001901614650001201633650001301645700002101658700002401679700002101703773012401724856007401848852000901922655001201931IND60618589220221120235301.0181030e20180806xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061858922DNAL7 a10.1039/c8ra03249a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSachan, Priyanka10aInfrared microlenses and gratings of chalcogenide: confined self-organization in solution processed thin liquid films  ap. 27946-27955.  aThis work demonstrates the fabrication of chalcogenide microstructures such as gratings, lenses and needles using a lithographically directed, evaporative self-organization of chalcogenide thin liquid films for the first time. Using a two-step annealing protocol, excess solvent of freshly coated ChG films is eliminated and then the liquid films are patterned using elastomeric masters with continuous or disconnected features during solvent evaporation. Although microcontact printing or capillary flow lithography has been proven to be useful to create continuous gratings and waveguide like structures in solid films, our method overcomes the limitation of structural continuity of the generated pattern and uses self-organization of solute ChG within the master's confinement to produce isolated microstructures. Fabrication of disjointed arrays of microlenses of various dimensions as well as conical shaped needles in ChG thin films has been demonstrated for relevant optical IR applications. This methodology establishes evaporative self-organization of ChG thin films as a viable alternative to creating microstructures in bulk ChG with hot-embossing, bypassing the need for ultra high temperature processing.  aPublisher supplied data 3aUHT treatment 3aannealing 3aevaporation 3aliquids 3amicrostructure 3asolutes 3asolvents1 aSingh, Radhakant1 aDwivedi, Prabhat K.1 aSharma, Ashutosh0 tRSC advances.g2018 Aug. 06, v. 8, no. 49 p.27946-27955dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c8ra03249a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03105naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001600139245016700155300001600322500002000338520161400358592002801972650002202000650001802022650002402040650001602064650002102080650001702101650002202118650001102140650001902151650002502170650003002195650001602225650001702241650001202258700002202270700001502292700001302307700002502320700001702345700001802362700001602380700001802396773011502414856007302529852000902602655001202611IND60595547220221117180438.0180605e201806  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059554722DNAL7 a10.1111/age.126482doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchiavo, G.10aFew mitochondrial DNA sequences are inserted into the turkey (Meleagris gallopavo) nuclear genome: evolutionary analyses and informativity in the domestic lineage  ap. 259-264.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aMitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) insertions have been detected in the nuclear genome of many eukaryotes. These sequences are pseudogenes originated by horizontal transfer of mtDNA fragments into the nuclear genome, producing nuclear DNA sequences of mitochondrial origin (numt). In this study we determined the frequency and distribution of mtDNA‐originated pseudogenes in the turkey (Meleagris gallopavo) nuclear genome. The turkey reference genome (Turkey_2.01) was aligned with the reference linearized mtDNA sequence using last. A total of 32 numt sequences (corresponding to 18 numt regions derived by unique insertional events) were identified in the turkey nuclear genome (size ranging from 66 to 1415 bp; identity against the modern turkey mtDNA corresponding region ranging from 62% to 100%). Numts were distributed in nine chromosomes and in one scaffold. They derived from parts of 10 mtDNA protein‐coding genes, ribosomal genes, the control region and 10 tRNA genes. Seven numt regions reported in the turkey genome were identified in orthologues positions in the Gallus gallus genome and therefore were present in the ancestral genome that in the Cretaceous originated the lineages of the modern crown Galliformes. Five recently integrated turkey numts were validated by PCR in 168 turkeys of six different domestic populations. None of the analysed numts were polymorphic (i.e. absence of the inserted sequence, as reported in numts of recent integration in other species), suggesting that the reticulate speciation model is not useful for explaining the origin of the domesticated turkey lineage.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCretaceous period 3aGallus gallus 3aMeleagris gallopavo 3achromosomes 3aeukaryotic cells 3amitochondria 3amitochondrial DNA 3amodels 3anuclear genome 3anucleotide sequences 3apolymerase chain reaction 3apseudogenes 3atransfer RNA 3aturkeys1 aStrillacci, M.

The ventral part of the body, especially the upper pectoral fin, was the area most frequently infected by this parasite. Parasite length was positively correlated with fish length, which suggests that the parasites attach to the fish at a young age. At the site of attachment, the parasites erode the epidermis, dermis and muscular tissue of the Sardinella. Such pathology may cause mortality in many fish. Infestation of this parasite was proportional to the weight of the fish. This study reports a new host for N. depressa attachment and is the first report of S. albella infestation in the Trat province where other known host fish species are cultured.  aPublisher supplied data 3aIsopoda 3aSardinella albella 3acorrelation 3adermis 3aestuaries 3amortality 3aparasites 3aparasitoses 3asardines 3aThailand1 aPurivirojkul, Watchariya0 tJournal of sea research.g2011 Feb., v. 65, no. 2 p.322-326dElsevier B.V.x1385-11017nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.seares.2010.11.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03095naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094024002200125024001900147040001800166100002300184245013700207506007600344520141600420592002801836506003701864650000801901650001301909650001001922650004201932650001301974650001301987650004402000700002202044700002402066700003502090700002002125700002402145700003702169700002202206700002002228700002302248700002602271700002202297700002402319700002102343700002002364773011902384856007702503852000902580655001202589IND60660481820221207105816.0190823e20190731xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066048182DNAL7 a10.3390/genes100805802doi7 aPMC67226412pmcid7 a313702762pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGiugliano, Teresa 10aClinical and Genetic Findings in Children with Neurofibromatosis Type 1, Legius Syndrome, and Other Related Neurocutaneous Disorders  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aPigmentary manifestations can represent an early clinical sign in children affected by Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), Legius syndrome, and other neurocutaneous disorders. The differential molecular diagnosis of these pathologies is a challenge that can now be met by combining next generation sequencing of target genes with concurrent second-level tests, such as multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification and RNA analysis. We clinically and genetically investigated 281 patients, almost all pediatric cases, presenting with either NF1 (n = 150), only pigmentary features (caf&eacute; au lait macules with or without freckling; (n = 95), or clinical suspicion of other RASopathies or neurocutaneous disorders (n = 36). The causative variant was identified in 239 out of the 281 patients analyzed (85.1%), while 42 patients remained undiagnosed (14.9%). The NF1 and SPRED1 genes were mutated in 73.3% and 2.8% of cases, respectively. The remaining 8.9% carried mutations in different genes associated with other disorders. We achieved a molecular diagnosis in 69.5% of cases with only pigmentary manifestations, allowing a more appropriate clinical management of these patients. Our findings, together with the increasing availability and sharing of clinical and genetic data, will help to identify further novel genotype&ndash;phenotype associations that may have a positive impact on patient follow-up.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aRNA 3achildren 3agenes 3ahigh-throughput nucleotide sequencing 3amutation 3apatients 3asigns and symptoms (animals and humans)1 aSantoro, Claudia 1 aTorella, Annalaura 1 aDel Vecchio Blanco, Francesca 1 aGrandone, Anna 1 aOnore, Maria  Elena1 aMelone, Mariarosa  Anna Beatrice1 aStraccia, Giulia 1 aMelis, Daniela 1 aPiccolo, Vincenzo 1 aLimongelli, Giuseppe 1 aBuono, Salvatore 1 aPerrotta, Silverio 1 aNigro, Vincenzo 1 aPiluso, Giulio 0 tGenes.g2019 July 31, v. 10, no. 8dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27140x2073-44257nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/genes100805803Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03232naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001700139245009800156520175200254592002802006650002302034650005202057650001602109650002202125650002302147650001202170650002302182650001902205650001702224650000802241650001802249650002302267650002302290650001402313650001402327650003102341650001702372650002202389650001002411700002502421700002102446700002302467700002302490700001902513773012302532856007402655852000902729655001202738IND60754416520221119054113.0211023e20210927xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075441652DNAL7 a10.3390/v131019382doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZuin, Marco 10aPrognostic Role of Metabolic Syndrome in COVID-19 Patients: A Systematic Review Meta-Analysis  aBackground: The prevalence and prognostic implications of metabolic syndrome (MetS) in patients infected by the SARS-CoV-2 remain unclear. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of prevalence and mortality risk in COVID-19 patients with MetS. Methods: Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines were followed in abstracting data and assessing validity. We searched MEDLINE and Scopus to locate every article published up to 1 September 2021, reporting data on MetS among COVID-19 patients. The pooled prevalence of MetS was calculated using a random effects model and presented using the related 95% confidence interval (CI), while the mortality risk was estimated using the Mantel-Haenszel random effects models with odds ratio (OR) and related 95% CI. Statistical heterogeneity was measured using the Higgins I² statistic. Results: Six studies, enrolling 209.569 COVID-19 patients [mean age 57.2 years, 114.188 males (54.4%)] met the inclusion criteria and were included in the final analysis. The pooled prevalence of dyslipidaemia was 20.5% of cases (95% CI: 6.7–47.8%, p = 0.03), with high heterogeneity (I² = 98.9%). Pre-existing MetS was significantly associated with higher risk of short-term mortality (OR: 2.30, 95% CI: 1.52–3.45, p < 0.001), with high heterogeneity (I² = 89.4%). Meta-regression showed a direct correlation with male gender (p = 0.03), hypertension (p < 0.001), DM (p = 0.01) and hyperlipidaemia (p = 0.04), but no effect when considering age (p = 0.75) and chronic pulmonary disease (p = 0.86) as moderators. Conclusions: MetS represents a major comorbidity in about 20% of COVID-19 patients and it is associated with a 230% increased risk of short-term mortality.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCOVID-19 infection 3aSevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 3acomorbidity 3adiabetes mellitus 3adisease prevalence 3afemales 3agender differences 3ahyperlipidemia 3ahypertension 3amen 3ameta-analysis 3ametabolic syndrome 3amiddle-aged adults 3amortality 3aprognosis 3arespiratory tract diseases 3arisk factors 3asystematic review 3awomen1 aRigatelli, Gianluca 1 aBilato, Claudio 1 aCervellati, Carlo 1 aZuliani, Giovanni 1 aRoncon, Loris 0 tViruses.g2021 Sept. 27, v. 13, no. 10dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27138x1999-49157nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/v131019383Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03821naa a2200673 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245012000167300001600287500001500303520192500318592002802243650001802271650002502289650003102314650001102345650002302356650002902379650001002408653001302418653000902431653001002440653002502450653001902475653001202494653001202506653000802518653000902526653000902535653001102544653001102555653001302566653000802579653000902587653000702596653000802603653000902611653001402620653001002634653000902644653000802653653001902661653002502680653003302705700005902738700002002797700002202817700001702839700005702856700001902913773011302932856008103045852000903126655001203135IND60529797120221122232212.0161020e20160415xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052979712DNAL7 a10.1016/j.mce.2016.01.0262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHattori, Yujiro10aHuman C-terminally truncated ERα variants resulting from the use of alternative exons in the ligand-binding domain  ap. 111-122.  a2019-12-06  aThe nuclear receptor genes contain alternative internal and terminal exons, with alternative exon incorporation yielding mRNA variants that encode various receptor types, including some with C-terminal truncation that exhibit constitutive activation or dominant-negative transcriptional transactivation. However, C-terminally truncated estrogen receptor α (ERα) variants with alternative sequences have rarely been reported in humans. Therefore, we assessed human ERα genomic organization and alternative splicing profiles, and identified both alternative exons and C-terminally truncated ERα variants. These naturally occurring C-terminally truncated ERα proteins were localized in the nuclei of transfected cells. In addition, ERαi45c and ERαΔ5 variants exhibited constitutive transactivation of an estrogen responsive element-driven promoter in transfected cells. We manufactured expression vectors encoding artificially truncated ERα constructs and evaluated their transactivation abilities to establish mechanisms determining the constitutive activity and dominant-negative properties of truncated variants. Lack of the region encoded in exon 8 eliminated basal and ligand-induced transcriptional transactivation. The C-terminally truncated ERα variants/constructs containing the helices 5 in their ligand-binding domains did not exhibit constitutive transactivation. Furthermore, we demonstrated that truncation from C-termini to helices 5 in the variant ligand-binding domains was required for constitutive activation and found that the remnant regions of the ligand-binding domains and variant-specific sequences influenced transcriptional transactivation efficiency. In conclusion, we elucidated the structural and functional features of novel C-terminally truncated ERα variants and revealed the mechanisms underlying constitutive transactivation by C-terminally truncated nuclear receptor variants.  aPublisher supplied data 3amessenger RNA 3aalternative splicing 3atranscriptional activation 3ahumans 3aestrogen receptors 3atranscription (genetics) 3aexons 0aEstrogen 0aDAPI 0agenes 0aAlternative splicing 0aHelical motifs 0aERαΔ7 0aERαΔ5 0aPBS 0aAF-1 0aDMEM 0aERα66 0aERα46 0aERαDup5 0aERE 0aERα 0aER 0aFBS 0aAF-2 0a3′-RACE 0aCTERP 0aERβ 0aORF 0aSplice variant 0aEstrogen receptor α 0aConstitutive transactivation1 aIshii, Hirotaka1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2044-316X1 aMunetomo, Arisa1 aWatanabe, Hiroshi1 aMorita, Akio1 aSakuma, Yasuo1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6816-37791 aOzawa, Hitoshi0 tMolecular and Cellular Endocrinology.g2016 Apr. 15, v. 425 p.111-122dElsevier Ireland Ltdx0303-72077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.mce.2016.01.0263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04280naa a2200697 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094024002200132024001900154040001800173100002200191245009300213506007600306520219200382592002802574506003702602650002502639650002102664650003002685650001102715650002402726650001102750650001502761650002202776650002802798650001902826650002702845650001702872650001402889650001502903650001202918650002002930650001402950650001202964650001302976650001502989650000903004650001503013650001203028651001003040653001303050653003903063700002303102700002603125700002503151700002903176700001703205700001703222700002003239700001703259700002203276700002403298700001403322700002203336773011903358856008403477852000903561655001203570IND60638180520221207110146.0190426e201808  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063818052DNAL7 a10.1016/j.parepi.2018.e000712doi7 aPMC60200852pmcid7 a299883032pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAdu-Gyasi, Dennis10aEpidemiology of soil transmitted Helminth infections in the middle-belt of Ghana, Africa  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aHelminths are among the most widespread infectious agents prevalent in tropical and sub-tropical regions of the developing world defined by inadequate sanitation, poverty and unsafe water sources. This study was carried out to describe the distribution of helminth and malaria parasite infections in the middle-belt of Ghana in sub-Saharan Africa where disease burden, including anaemia is rife and helminths are perceived to be significant contributors of the burden.A cross-sectional survey involving 1826 residents located in the middle belt of Ghana where no or very little previous community-based helminth work had been carried out. The participants randomly recruited at household level provided biological samples collected over a 12-month period following a rigorous consenting process and these were analysed to describe the different types and seasonal distribution of helminths.Overall, 19.3% intestinal helminth infection prevalence was documented. Also based on parasites targeted for elimination, 12.1% Hookworm, 4.0% Hymenolepis nana/Hymenolepis dimunita, 1.5% Ascaris lumbricoides, 1.5% Taenia species, 0.9% Strongyloides stercoralis and 0.8% Trichuris trichiura, with about 1.0% polyphelminthiasis were recorded in the survey. About 55.4% and 44.4% of the participants had heavy hookworm and Trichuris infections respectively. Most of the Ascariasis (83.3%) infections were light in intensity. Hookworm infection was identified with significant odds considering decreasing age (OR = 2.09, p = 0.03), inappropriate footwear use (OR = 1.88, p = 0.021), malaria parasite co-infection (OR = 1.62, p = 0.018), not scrubbing nails during hand washing (OR = 0.68, p = 0.048), source of drinking water (OR = 2.51, p = 0.027) and religion (OR = 4.36, p = 0.002).Hookworm infection was significantly higher in younger age groups and among those who did not have safe drinking water. Proper sanitation, protective footwear, religion and good personal hygiene practices were found to influence helminth and hookworm prevalence in the area. Malaria parasite coinfection with helminths, especially hookworm infections increased 2-fold.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aAscaris lumbricoides 3aHymenolepis nana 3aStrongyloides stercoralis 3aTaenia 3aTrichuris trichiura 3aanemia 3aascariasis 3aburden of disease 3across-sectional studies 3adrinking water 3agood hygiene practices 3ahand washing 3ahookworms 3aintestines 3amalaria 3amixed infection 3apathogens 3apoverty 3areligion 3asanitation 3asoil 3asubtropics 3asurveys 3aGhana 0aHelminth 0aEnvironmental and personal hygiene1 aAsante, Kwaku Poku1 aFrempong, Margaret T.1 aGyasi, Dennis Konadu1 aIddrisu, Louisa Fatahiya1 aAnkrah, Love1 aDosoo, David1 aAdeniji, Elisha1 aAgyei, Oscar1 aGyaase, Stephaney1 aAmenga-Etego, Seeba1 aGyan, Ben1 aOwusu-Agyei, Seth0 tParasite epidemiology and control.g2018 Aug., v. 3, no. 3 p.e00071-dElsevier LtdwJournal:23217x2405-67317nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.parepi.2018.e000713Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02994naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094024002200134024001900156040001800175100001300193245015600206300001600362500001500378506007600393520127100469592002801740506003701768650003501805650001301840650001801853650001501871650001401886650003201900650001901932650003801951650002301989650001302012650001402025650001202039650001402051650001802065650003402083653002702117700001702144700001402161700001902175700002402194700001502218700001802233773010602251856008602357852000902443655001202452IND60087729220221207130402.0141102e201112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008772922DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jviromet.2011.09.0042doi7 aPMC32132042pmcid7 a219452212pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiao, Qi10aSimultaneous detection of antibodies to five simian viruses in nonhuman primates using recombinant viral protein based multiplex microbead immunoassays  ap. 143-152.  a2019-12-06  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aRoutine screening for infectious agents is critical in establishing and maintaining specific pathogen free (SPF) nonhuman primate (NHP) colonies. More efficient, higher throughput, less costly reagent, and reduced sample consumption multiplex microbead immunoassays (MMIAs) using purified viral lysates have been developed previously to address some disadvantages of the traditional individual enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) methods. To overcome some of the technical and biosafety difficulties in preparing antigens from live viruses for viral lysate protein based MMIAs, novel MMIAs using recombinant glycoprotein D precursor (gD) protein of herpesvirus B and four viral gag proteins of simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV), simian T Cell lymphotropic virus (STLV), simian foamy virus (SFV), and simian betaretrovirus (SRV) as antigens have been developed in the current study. The data showed that the recombinant viral protein based MMIAs detected simultaneously antibodies to each of these five viruses with high sensitivity and specificity, and correlated well with viral lysate based MMIAs. Therefore, recombinant viral protein based MMIA is an effective and efficient routine screening method to determine the infection status of nonhuman primates.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aspecific pathogen-free animals 3aantigens 3aT-lymphocytes 3aantibodies 3abiosafety 3aMacacine alphaherpesvirus 1 3aBetaretrovirus 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3aSimian foamy virus 3aPrimates 3apathogens 3aviruses 3ascreening 3aglycoproteins 3aSimian immunodeficiency virus 0aMacacine herpesvirus 11 aGuo, Huishan1 aTang, Min1 aTouzjian, Neal1 aLerche, Nicholas W.1 aLu, Yichen1 aYee, JoAnn L.0 tJournal of virological methods.g2011 Dec., v. 178, no. 1-2 p.143-152dElsevier B.V.x0166-09347nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jviromet.2011.09.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02257naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002400140245009900164500001400263520118600277592002801463650001301491650002201504650001301526650001901539650002601558650002201584650002201606650001201628650001901640700002001659700002501679773012001704856007401824852000901898655001201907IND60715241220221119075930.0201026e20201016xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071524122DNAL7 a10.3390/fib81000652doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSzewczyk, Piotr  K.10aHumidity Controlled Mechanical Properties of Electrospun Polyvinylidene Fluoride (PVDF) Fibers  aNAL-light  aProcessing parameters in electrospinning allow us to control the properties of fibers on a molecular level and are able to tailor them for specific applications. In this study, we investigate how relative humidity (RH) affects the mechanical properties of electrospun polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF). The mechanical properties of single fibers were carried out using a specialized tensile stage. The results from tensile tests were additionally correlated with high-resolution imaging showing the behavior of individual fibers under tensile stress. The mechanical characteristic is strongly dependent on the crystallinity, chain orientation, and fiber diameter of electrospun PVDF fibers. Our results show the importance of controlling RH during electrospinning as the mechanical properties are significantly affected. At low RH = 30% PVDF fibers are 400% stiffer than their counterparts prepared at high RH = 60%. Moreover, the vast differences in the strain at failure were observed, namely 310% compared to 75% for 60% and 30% RH, respectively. Our results prove that humidity is a crucial parameter in electrospinning able to control the mechanical properties of polymer fibers.  aPublisher supplied data 3abehavior 3acrystal structure 3adiameter 3aimage analysis 3amechanical properties 3amechanical stress 3arelative humidity 3atesting 3athermoplastics1 aUra, Daniel  P.1 aStachewicz, Urszula 0 tFibers.g2020 Oct. 16, v. 8, no. 10dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27134x2079-64397nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/fib81000653Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02815naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001500147245007700162300001400239520162300253592002801876650001501904650001901919650001601938650001401954650001901968650001201987650001901999650002102018650001002039650003302049650001502082650001702097650002302114650001102137651001302148700001502161700002102176773010602197856008102303852000902384655001202393IND60477628120221118230258.0151231e201603  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6047762812DNAL7 a10.1007/s11707-015-0521-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTan, K. C.12aA statistical model to predict total column ozone in Peninsular Malaysia  ap. 63-73.  aThis study aims to predict monthly columnar ozone in Peninsular Malaysia based on concentrations of several atmospheric gases. Data pertaining to five atmospheric gases (CO₂, O₃, CH₄, NO₂, and H₂O vapor) were retrieved by satellite scanning imaging absorption spectrometry for atmospheric chartography from 2003 to 2008 and used to develop a model to predict columnar ozone in Peninsular Malaysia. Analyses of the northeast monsoon (NEM) and the southwest monsoon (SWM) seasons were conducted separately. Based on the Pearson correlation matrices, columnar ozone was negatively correlated with H₂O vapor but positively correlated with CO₂ and NO₂ during both the NEM and SWM seasons from 2003 to 2008. This result was expected because NO₂ is a precursor of ozone. Therefore, an increase in columnar ozone concentration is associated with an increase in NO₂ but a decrease in H₂O vapor. In the NEM season, columnar ozone was negatively correlated with H₂O (–0.847), NO₂ (0.754), and CO₂ (0.477); columnar ozone was also negatively but weakly correlated with CH₄ (–0.035). In the SWM season, columnar ozone was highly positively correlated with NO₂ (0.855), CO₂ (0.572), and CH₄ (0.321) and also highly negatively correlated with H₂O (–0.832). Both multiple regression and principal component analyses were used to predict the columnar ozone value in Peninsular Malaysia. We obtained the best-fitting regression equations for the columnar ozone data using four independent variables. Our results show approximately the same R value (≈ 0.83) for both the NEM and SWM seasons.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3acarbon dioxide 3acorrelation 3aequations 3aimage analysis 3amethane 3amonsoon season 3anitrogen dioxide 3aozone 3aprincipal component analysis 3asatellites 3aspectroscopy 3astatistical models 3avapors 3aMalaysia1 aLim, H.

We studied the vegetation of Eurasian steppic oakwoods in the Czech Republic where they are at the westernmost outcrop of their potential distribution to understand ecosystem changes and their drivers in the period of modern environmental change. In 2012, we resampled a set of semi-permanent plots established in 1965. Long-term compositional shifts and biotic homogenization were linked mainly to eutrophication and canopy closure. Ecological groups of nitrophytes and neophytes increased, while assemblages of species characteristic for open woodlands declined. This process can be attributed to several factors including changes in forest management, the rise of the native woody species Tilia cordata, airborne nitrogen input to generally nutrient-poor substrates and subsequent increase of invasive plant species, and finally to increased wildboar density. The decline of the unique communities of open steppic oakwoods will likely continue under the current management, increased nitrogen availability and canopy closure. Although reintroducing the wide range of historical forest uses is not realistic, the removal of Tilia individuals, reduction of the wild boar population and the promotion of Quercus to maintain the open-canopy structure may moderate the shift towards novel communities and help to restore open oakwoods.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTilia cordata 3acanopy 3aecosystems 3aeutrophication 3aforest management 3anitrogen 3aplant communities 3awoodlands 3awoody plants 3aCzech Republic 0aBiotic invasion 0aOpen oakwoods1 aHédl, Radim1 aZouhar, Václav1 aSzabó, Péter K.q( Péter Károly),0 tBiological conservation.g2017 June, v. 210 p.163-173dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl44607x0006-32077nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biocon.2017.04.0173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03052naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006100148245010600209300001800315520171200333592002802045596003502073650002002108650001702128650001302145650001302158650001202171650001102183650001502194650002402209650002402233650001202257650002302269650001002292650001202302650001602314650001502330651001202345700002302357700002002380773011502400856008202515852000902597655001202606IND60666679520221120144013.0190917e201910  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066667952DNAL7 a10.1007/s12571-019-00948-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNordhagen, Stella1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3801-376914aThe sustainability of a nutrition-sensitive agriculture intervention: a case study from urban Senegal  ap. 1121-1134.  aThe sustainability of nutrition-sensitive agriculture projects has been identified as a research gap, and there is limited research available examining such initiatives in an urban context. We examine the sustainability of a nutrition-sensitive agriculture project implemented in Dakar, Senegal. It included provision of two “microgarden” tables, a henhouse, chickens, inputs, training, and education on nutrition and hygiene. This study was conducted 18 months after the project's end and sought to assess the intervention’s sustainability via a survey and in-depth interviews with former project participants. The microgarden tables had poor sustainability: only 5% of respondents continued to use them to grow vegetables. Most of those who continued saw it as a hobby, not a main productive activity. In contrast, 75% continued poultry-rearing activities, and 20% had more chickens than provided by the project. Some former participants had switched to more lucrative models of chicken production, with sales being more common than during the project and considerable revenues earned. This ability to earn income from chicken sales was the dominant motivator of continued production. Nutrition knowledge and practices remained at or near project levels. We discuss lessons for the sustainability of nutrition-sensitive agriculture more generally. These include that in the absence of project-provided incentives, some dis-adoption should be expected; in an urban area, improving incomes may be more relevant than improving production; and behavior change communication likely needs to be re-enforced over time to ensure sustainable changes in nutrition knowledge among parents of young children.  aPublisher supplied data  a7059619cGlobal Affairs Canada 3abehavior change 3acase studies 3achickens 3achildren 3ahygiene 3aincome 3ainterviews 3anutrition education 3anutrition knowledge 3aparents 3apoultry production 3asales 3asurveys 3aurban areas 3avegetables 3aSenegal1 aThiam, Khadidjatou1 aSow, Souleymane0 tFood security.g2019 Oct., v. 11, no. 5 p.1121-1134dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:J000000074x1876-45177nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12571-019-00948-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02745naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100001800142245012300160300001600283520113000299592002801429650003301457650001501490650001201505650001601517650002501533650001001558650001601568650001301584650001301597650001201610650001101622650001301633650001401646650001601660650001401676650002001690650001601710650000901726653002501735653001001760653002101770653001401791653001601805653002501821700002201846700001801868700002401886700001901910700002401929773013701953856008002090852000902170655001202179IND60219804820221120210637.0151127e201506  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6021980482DNAL7 a10.1638/2014-0232R.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFranzen, Dana10aDiagnosis and medical and surgical management of chronic infectious fibrinous pleuritis in an okapi (okapia johnstoni)  ap. 427-430.  aA 10-yr-old female okapi (Okapia johnstoni) at the San Diego Zoo Safari Park was evaluated for intermittent malaise, inappetence, occasional cough, abdominal splinting, and licking at both flanks. Physical examination revealed tachypnea, tachycardia, and fluid sounds on thoracic auscultation. Transthoracic ultrasound showed multiple uniform, anechoic filled structures in the right and left pleural space. Surgical exploration of the thoracic cavity revealed bilateral, mature, fibrous, compartmentalizing adhesions between the visceral and parietal pleura, confirming a diagnosis of chronic, infectious, fibrinous pleuritis. The suspected etiology was occult aspiration pneumonia secondary to historical episodes of regurgitation associated with general anesthesia. Culture of the pleural fluid and fibrous adhesions grew Trueperella (Arcanobacterium) pyogenes, Arcanobacterium haemolyticum, and few Fusobacterium species. Treatment consisted of chest-tube placement to establish drainage, thoracic lavage, unilateral surgical debridement, and long-term antibiotics.

The most economically important of these is potato scab, and the most studied of these pathogens is Streptomyces scabiei (syn. S. scabies). The main pathogenicity determinant of scab-causing Streptomyces species is a nitrated diketopiperazine, known as thaxtomin A (ThxA). In the pathogenic species Streptomyces turgidiscabies, ThxA biosynthetic genes reside on a mobile pathogenicity island (PAI). However, the mobilization of PAIs in other Streptomyces species remains uncharacterized. Here, we investigated the mobilization of the PAI of S. scabiei 87-22. Based on whole genome sequences, we inferred the evolutionary relationships of pathogenic Streptomyces species and discovered that Streptomyces sp. strain 96-12, a novel pathogenic species isolated from potatoes in Egypt, was phylogenetically grouped with nonpathogenic species rather than with known pathogenic species. We also found that Streptomyces sp. strain 96-12 contains a PAI that is almost identical to the PAI in S. scabiei 87-22, despite significant differences in their genome sequences. This suggested direct or indirect in vivo mobilization of the PAI between S. scabiei and nonpathogenic Streptomyces species. To test whether the S. scabiei 87-22 PAI could, indeed, be mobilized, S. scabiei 87-22 deletion mutants containing antibiotic resistance markers in the PAI were mated with Streptomyces diastatochromogenes, a nonpathogenic species. The PAI of S. scabiei was site-specifically inserted into the aviX1 gene of S. diastatochromogenes and conferred pathogenicity in radish seedling assays. Our results demonstrated that S. scabiei, the earliest described Streptomyces pathogen, could be the source of a PAI responsible for the emergence of novel pathogenic species.  aPublisher supplied data 3aStreptomyces diastatochromogenes 3aStreptomyces scabiei 3aStreptomyces turgidiscabies 3aantibiotic resistance 3adiketopiperazines 3agenes 3amutants 3anucleotide sequences 3apathogenicity 3apathogenicity islands 3apathogens 3aphylogeny 3apotatoes 3aradishes 3aseedlings 3aEgypt1 aBignell, Dawn R.

While a role for ubiquitin in regulating the degradation of misfolded ER-resident proteins is well described, ubiquitin-dependent regulation of translational reprogramming during the UPR remains uncharacterized. Using global quantitative ubiquitin proteomics, we identify evolutionarily conserved, site-specific regulatory ubiquitylation of 40S ribosomal proteins. We demonstrate that these events occur on assembled cytoplasmic ribosomes and are stimulated by both UPR activation and translation inhibition. We further show that ER stress-stimulated regulatory 40S ribosomal ubiquitylation occurs on a timescale similar to eIF2α phosphorylation, is dependent upon PERK signaling, and is required for optimal cell survival during chronic UPR activation. In total, these results reveal regulatory 40S ribosomal ubiquitylation as an important facet of eukaryotic translational control.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3acell viability 3ahomeostasis 3aphosphorylation 3aprotein folding 3aproteomics 3aribosomal proteins 3aribosomes 3atranslation (genetics) 3aubiquitin 3aunfolded protein response1 aGendron, Joshua M.1 aRising, Lisa1 aMak, Raymond1 aWebb, Kristofor1 aKaiser, Stephen E.1 aZuzow, Nathan1 aRivière, Paul,1 aYang, Bing1 aFenech, Emma1 aTang, Xin1 aLindsay, Scott A.1 aChristianson, John C.,1 aHampton, Randolph Y.1 aWasserman, Steven A.1 aBennett, Eric J.0 tMolecular cell.g2015 July 02, v. 59 p.35-49dElsevier Inc.x1097-27657nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.molcel.2015.04.0263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03171naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094024002200125024001900147040001800166100002100184245014000205506007600345520159800421592002802019506003702047650004602084650002302130650002202153650001102175650001302186650002002199650001102219650001302230650001302243650001902256650001202275650001902287650001202306650003502318650001002353651001002363700001702373700001602390700001602406700001802422700002002440773011902460856007702579852000902656655001202665IND60660482120221207105818.0190823e20190731xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066048212DNAL7 a10.3390/genes100805832doi7 aPMC67232362pmcid7 a313703242pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDong, Mingliang 10aGenetic Mapping of Prince Rupprecht’s Larch (<i>Larix principis-rupprechtii</i> Mayr) by Specific-Locus Amplified Fragment Sequencing  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aA high-density genetic linkage map is essential for plant genetics and genomics research. However, due to the deficiency of genomic data and high-quality molecular markers, no genetic map has been published for Prince Rupprecht&rsquo;s larch (Larix principis-rupprechtii Mayr), a conifer species with high ecological and commercial value in northern China. In this study, 145 F1 progeny individuals from an intraspecific cross between two elite clones of L. principis-rupprechtii and their parents were employed to construct the first genetic map in this important tree species using specific-locus amplified fragment sequencing (SLAF-seq). After preprocessing, the procedure yielded 300.20 Gb of raw data containing 1501.22 M pair-end reads. A total of 324,352 SNP markers were detected and 122,785 of them were polymorphic, with a polymorphism rate of 37.86%. Ultimately, 6099 SNPs were organized into a genetic map containing 12 linkage groups, consistent with the haploid chromosome number of larch and most other species in the Pinaceae family. The linkage map spanned 2415.58 cM and covered 99.6% of the L. principis-rupprechtii genome with an average of 0.4 cM between adjacent markers. To the best of our knowledge, this map is the first reference map for L. principis-rupprechtii, as well as the densest one obtained in larch species thus far. The genome-wide SNPs and the high-resolution genetic map will provide a foundation for future quantitative trait loci mapping, map-based cloning, marker-assisted selection, comparative genomics, and genome sequence assembly for larch trees.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aLarix gmelinii var. principis-rupprechtii 3achromosome mapping 3achromosome number 3aclones 3aconifers 3agenetic markers 3agenome 3agenomics 3ahaploidy 3alinkage groups 3aparents 3aplant genetics 3aprogeny 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism 3atrees 3aChina1 aHe, Qingwei 1 aZhao, Jian 1 aZhang, Yan 1 aYuan, Deshui 1 aZhang, Jinfeng 0 tGenes.g2019 July 31, v. 10, no. 8dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27140x2073-44257nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/genes100805833Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01647naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100001800142245006200160500001400222520067500236592002800911650002700939650002300966650002500989650002301014650001801037650001001055650000901065650002001074650002201094773012001116856007601236852000901312655001201321IND60715241420221119075954.0201026e20200923xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071524142DNAL7 a10.3390/foods91013402doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHayes, Maria 10aMeasuring Protein Content in Food: An Overview of Methods  aNAL-light  aIn order to determine the quantity of protein in food, it is important to have standardized analytical methods.

Investigations have shown that biomass accumulation in high-input, high yielding UNR (25cm spaced rows with yields greater than 1800kglintha−1) cotton is similar to conventionally spaced rows (100cm) despite a three-fold increase in plant density, indicating a limitation on individual plant growth. This study investigates whether the increased plant density in UNR crops (36plantsm−2) leads to differences in canopy development, radiation use efficiency (RUE) and light interception contributing to plant growth limitations. Three experiments over three years compared UNR treatments to conventionally spaced treatments in high-input production systems and found that early canopy development (leaf area index LAI) and consequently early interception was higher in the UNR crops in two of the three experiments. This resulted in a 17% higher seasonal canopy extinction coefficient (k) in UNR crops over the season. However, seasonal RUE of the UNR crop was 19% lower as increases in light interception were not accompanied by increased total dry matter. Light distribution through the canopy was poorer (higher k) in the UNR crop and LAI continued to increase in the UNR crop after maximum light interception was reached, which combined with a lower leaf nitrogen concentration may have reduced the photosynthetic efficiency of the UNR crop. We conclude that differences in canopy light interception and the efficiency of conversion of light to biomass were the primary factors responsible for differences in the pattern of biomass accumulation between UNR and conventionally spaced cotton.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiomass production 3acanopy 3acotton 3acrops 3adry matter accumulation 3aleaf area index 3aleaves 3anitrogen content 3aphotosynthesis 3aplant density 3aplant growth 3aproduction technology 3aradiation use efficiency 3arow spacing 0aGossypium hirsutum 0aLeaf area index 0aLight interception 0aCanopy extinction coefficient 0aRadiation use efficiency 0aRow spacing1 aBange, M.P.1 aMilroy, S.P.1 aHammer, G.L.0 tField crops research.g2013 July, v. 148 p.86-94dElsevier B.V.aElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl10215x0378-42907nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fcr.2012.05.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02324naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001600144245009300160520115700253592002801410650003401438650001201472650002201484650002001506650000901526650002201535650001801557650002601575650001701601700001901618700001901637700001801656700001801674700001601692700002101708773012101729856007901850852000901929655001201938IND60787860920221120162437.0220811e20220726xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078786092DNAL7 a10.3390/plants111519382doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSong, Giha 10aOsWRKY114 Negatively Regulates Drought Tolerance by Restricting Stomatal Closure in Rice  aThe WRKY family of transcription factors plays a pivotal role in plant responses to biotic and abiotic stress. The WRKY Group III transcription factor OsWRKY114 is a positive regulator of innate immunity against Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae; however, its role in abiotic stress responses is largely unknown. In this study, we showed that the abundant OsWRKY114 transcripts present in transgenic rice plants are reduced under drought conditions. The overexpression of OsWRKY114 significantly increased drought sensitivity in rice, which resulted in a lower survival rate after drought stress. Moreover, we showed that stomatal closure, which is a strategy to save water under drought, is restricted in OsWRKY114-overexpressing plants compared with wild-type plants. The expression levels of PYR/PYL/RCAR genes, such as OsPYL2 and OsPYL10 that confer drought tolerance through stomatal closure, were also markedly lower in the OsWRKY114-overexpressing plants. Taken together, these results suggest that OsWRKY114 negatively regulates plant tolerance to drought stress via inhibition of stomatal closure, which would otherwise prevent water loss in rice.  aPublisher supplied data 3aXanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae 3adrought 3adrought tolerance 3ainnate immunity 3arice 3astomatal movement 3asurvival rate 3atranscription factors 3awater stress1 aSon, Seungmin 1 aLee, Kyong Sil1 aPark, Yeo Jin1 aSuh, Eun Jung1 aLee, Soo In1 aPark, Sang Ryeol0 tPlants.g2022 July 26, v. 11, no. 15dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21620x2223-77477nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/plants111519383Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02560naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245010500165300001800270520128300288592002801571650001701599650001101616650000901627650001901636650003501655650000901690650001101699650001401710650002201724650002401746650001701770650001601787650001201803700005601815700002701871700001501898700001901913773011501932856008202047852000902129655001202138IND60666679720221120141728.0190917e201910  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066667972DNAL7 a10.1007/s12571-019-00963-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Jiaojiao10aFood access inequalities in Chinese urban neighborhoods: a case study of the Dalian development zone  ap. 1087-1099.  aDifficulties in accessing food exist in some Chinese cities, and it can be a challenge for residents to buy affordable, good-quality and nutritious fresh foods. This study proposes a residential building-based measure to evaluate food accessibility based on Geographic Information Systems. We used a total of eight types of food retailers and 28 food categories in our analysis and explored whether inequities in access to food existed among neighborhoods with different housing prices in the Dalian Development Zone using Kruskal-Wallis test methods. Our results show that 38% of residents living in 3724 residential buildings required between five and 10 min to access the nearest supermarket, while 10% required more than 20 min. The mean walking accessibility to stores with eggs (10 min) and with milk (10 min) was quicker than that to other types of food stores (14–16 min). In addition, high-wealth neighborhoods had better food accessibility than did low-wealth neighborhoods. However, in comparison to the other studied neighborhoods, those with medium-low-wealth had the highest level of food accessibility. Our results can be used by policymakers to better understand food access in residential areas and to help improve the food environment in Chinese cities.  aPublisher supplied data 3acase studies 3acities 3aeggs 3afood retailing 3ageographic information systems 3amilk 3aprices 3araw foods 3aresidential areas 3aresidential housing 3asupermarkets 3aurban areas 3awalking1 aSong, Guobao1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4862-41921 aSemakula, Henry Musoke1 aDou, Yijie1 aZhang, Shushen0 tFood security.g2019 Oct., v. 11, no. 5 p.1087-1099dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:J000000074x1876-45177nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12571-019-00963-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03005naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002800143245009200171300001400263506002800277520140000305592002801705506003701733650002701770650002201797650002901819650002501848650001301873650001501886650002901901650001701930650002601947650001801973650001601991650002002007653002402027653002102051653004302072653002702115653001802142700002702160700002502187700002302212700002802235700002502263773012402288856007802412852000902490655001202499IND60740034120221207071243.0101112s2003    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074003412DNAL7 a10.2298/ZMSPN0304051P2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPajević, Slobodanka P.10aAquatic macrophytes as indicators of heavy metal pollution of water in DTD canal system  ap. 51-60.  aResource is Open Access  aThe aim of this investigation was to establish the presence or absence of chemical contamination of water and the littoral zone (banks) of Danube-Tisza-Danube (DTD) canal system. The investigation covered the canal section from Bezdan to Prigrevica. By analyzing the chemical composition of dominant aquatic species in four locations of the section, we defined the species with the highest capacity to accumulate nutrients and heavy metals. Concentrations of P and K as well as of a beneficial element Na in the tissues of the analyzed macrophytes were both species- and site-dependent. The highest accumulation was registered for Ceratophyllum demersum while the species Elodea canadensis showed increased P and K accumulation values in the location Sombor. The lowest concentrations of almost all heavy metals were recorded near Sombor, indicating that this section suffered the lowest chemical pollution. Highest concentrations of all of the analyzed heavy metals were recorded in the tissue of Ceratophyllum demersum from the location Prigrevica, possibly due to the influx of polluted drainage waters from surrounding agricultural areas as well as industrial wastewaters. The obtained results showed that the enforcement of biomonitoring and analyses of other parameters indicative of ecosystem conditions might be useful for improved protection of areas experiencing a strong human impact.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aCeratophyllum demersum 3aElodea canadensis 3aanthropogenic activities 3achemical composition 3adrainage 3aecosystems 3aenvironmental monitoring 3aheavy metals 3aindustrial wastewater 3alittoral zone 3amacrophytes 3awater pollution 0aaquatic macrophytes 0aDTD canal system 0anutrient and heavy metals accumulation 0achemical contamination 0abioindication1 aVučković, Mirjana S.1 aKevrešan, Žarko S.1 aMatavulj, Milan N.1 aRadulović, Snežana B.1 aRadnović, Dragan V.0 tZbornik Matice srpske za prirodne nauke.g2003, v. 2003, no. 104 p.51-60dMatica srpskawJournal:27734x0352-49067nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2298/ZMSPN0304051P3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02894naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001300147245015800160520152900318592002801847650002501875650001701900650001601917650002101933650001801954650001201972650001101984650001001995650001102005650001502016650000902031653002302040653002602063653002902089653003102118653002302149653002102172700001102193700001302204700001602217700001802233773009402251856008202345852000902427655001202436IND60725301520221119064533.0210223e202012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072530152DNAL7 a10.1016/j.dib.2020.1063922doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSong, Ru10aData of the release properties of astaxanthin-loaded zein/calcium alginate composite microparticles in fatty food simulant system at 4 °C and 25 °C  aRecently, we demonstrated the characteristics and molecular interactions of Astaxanthin (Asta), extracted from shrimp (Litopenaeus vannamei) by-products to zein/calcium alginate (CA) (named as Asta-loaded zein/CA composite microparticles). The encapsulation efficiency of Asta-zein/CA composite microparticles obtained from freeze dried, 40 °C or 50 °C oven dried was across 80% [1]. In this data, we investigted the release properties of Asta-loaded zein/CA composite microparticles in simulating fatty food system (95% ethanol solution) at 4 °C and 25 °C. At different points of time, the cumulative release percentages of Asta from the tested composite microparticles were calculated. The release kinetics of Asta from the composite microparticles was investigated using Zero order, First order, Higuchi and Rigter-Peppas models. We observed all of the tested composited microparticles displayed an initial burst effect followed by subsequent attenuating release in 4 °C and 25 °C fatty food simulant system. At 4 °C fatty food system, the Asta released from 40 °C oven dried and 50 °C oven dried composite microparticles fit best with First-order and Ritger-Peppas models, respectively. At 25 °C fatty food system, all of these tested composite microparticles fit best with Higuchi model. Our results indicate the prepared composite microparticles are expected to be used as a delivery carrier for restrained release of antioxidant Asta in fatty foods, such as in natural vegetable oils or fried foods.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLitopenaeus vannamei 3aantioxidants 3aastaxanthin 3acalcium alginate 3aencapsulation 3aethanol 3amodels 3aovens 3ashrimp 3avegetables 3azein 0aShrimp by-products 0aZein/calcium alginate 0aComposite microparticles 0aFatty food simulant system 0aCumulative release 0aRelease kinetics1 aQi, Yu1 aJia, Zhe1 aLiu, Xinyan1 aWei, Rongbian0 tData in Brief.g2020 Dec., v. 33 p.106392-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:23203x2352-34097nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.dib.2020.1063923Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02524naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002100139245009000160520137200250592002801622650001701650650001501667650001101682650001301693650001101706650001301717650002401730651001601754700001901770700001801789700002001807700001801827700002101845700001901866700001801885700001701903773012301920856007402043852000902117655001202126IND60754416820221119054052.0211023e20210928xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075441682DNAL7 a10.3390/v131019412doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLee, Sook-Young 10aAstrovirus Infection in Cattle with Nonsuppurative Meningoencephalitis in South Korea  aNeurological diseases in cattle can be caused by several infectious agents. Astroviruses are increasingly recognized as the causative agent of encephalitis in various animals, including humans. In this study, a neuroinvasive astrovirus (BoAstV 20B05) was discovered in the brain tissues of an 81-month-old Korean native cattle with neurological symptoms. Lymphocyte infiltration and multifocal perivascular cuffing were observed in the cerebrum and brain stem, and viral antigens were also detected in the meninges. In particular, the concentration of the astroviral genome was high in the brain tissues. Korean BoAstV 20B05 was classified into the CH13/NeuroS1 clade and was closely related to the Neuro-Uy and KagoshimaSR28-462 strains. Our evolutionary analysis showed that Korean BoAstV 20B05 belongs to the sub-lineage NeuroS1 and evolved independently of BoAstV KagoshimaSR28-462. These results suggest that neuroinvasive astroviruses were first introduced in Korea. However, analysis is limited by the lack of reference astrovirus sequences reported in various countries within Asia, and further analysis should be performed using more strains. In this study, we identified a neuroinvasive astrovirus infection with neurological symptoms for the first time in South Korea and confirmed that BoAstV 20B05 may have been introduced in South Korea a long time ago.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAstroviridae 3abrain stem 3acattle 3acerebrum 3agenome 3ameninges 3ameningoencephalitis 3aSouth Korea1 aKim, Chong-ho,1 aKim, Yoon-Ji 1 aKim, Young-Sik 1 aRoh, Su-Gwon 1 aLee, Kyung-Hyun 1 aKim, Heui-Jin 1 aShin, Jae-Ho 1 aOem, Jae-Ku 0 tViruses.g2021 Sept. 28, v. 13, no. 10dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27138x1999-49157nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/v131019413Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02406naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094024002200125024001900147040001800166100003100184245006400215506007600279520121800355592002801573506003701601650001401638650002301652650003401675650001701709650001101726650002401737650000901761650001801770650001501788700002401803773011901827856007701946852000902023655001202032IND60660482320221207105825.0190823e20190724xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066048232DNAL7 a10.3390/genes100805582doi7 aPMC67236212pmcid7 a313449612pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLópez-Cortegano, Eugenio 10aGWEHS: A Genome-Wide Effect Sizes and Heritability Screener  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aDuring the last decade, there has been a huge development of Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS), and thousands of loci associated to complex traits have been detected. These efforts have led to the creation of public databases of GWAS results, making a huge source of information available on the genetic background of many diverse traits. Here we present GWEHS (Genome-Wide Effect size and Heritability Screener), an open-source online application to screen loci associated to human complex traits and diseases from the NHGRI-EBI GWAS Catalog. This application provides a way to explore the distribution of effect sizes of loci affecting these traits, as well as their contribution to heritability. Furthermore, it allows for making predictions on the change in the expected mean effect size, as well as in the heritability as new loci are found. The application enables inferences on whether the additive contribution of loci expected to be discovered in the future will be able to explain the estimates of familial heritability for the different traits. We illustrate the use of this tool, compare some of the results obtained with those from a previous meta-analysis, and discuss its uses and limitations.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3adatabases 3agenetic background 3agenome-wide association study 3aheritability 3ahumans 3ainformation sources 3aloci 3ameta-analysis 3aprediction1 aCaballero, Armando 0 tGenes.g2019 July 24, v. 10, no. 8dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27140x2073-44257nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/genes100805583Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03403naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245010000167300001600267520169500283592002801978650001902006650002302025650001302048650002002061650001902081650001102100650002302111650001902134650001202153650001602165650000902181650001302190650001902203650001502222650001102237650002402248650001302272653002202285653001702307653001502324653002402339653001602363700001202379700002302391700006402414700001302478700001702491700006002508700005402568773012102622856008502743852000902828655001202837IND60616060320221119170916.0200830e201812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061606032DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envpol.2018.09.0182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhao, Linduo10aCo-contaminant effects on 1,4-dioxane biodegradation in packed soil column flow-through systems  ap. 573-581.  aBiodegradation of 1,4-dioxane was examined in packed quartz and soil column flow-through systems. The inhibitory effects of co-contaminants, specifically trichloroethene (TCE), 1,1-dichloroethene (1,1-DCE), and copper (Cu²⁺) ions, were investigated in the columns either with or without bioaugmentation with a 1,4-dioxane degrading bacterium Pseudonocardia dioxanivorans CB1190. Results indicate that CB1190 cells readily grew and colonized in the columns, leading to significant degradation of 1,4-dioxane under oxic conditions. Degradation of 1,4-dioxane was also observed in the native soil (without bioaugmentation), which had been previously subjected to enhanced reductive dechlorination treatment for co-contaminants TCE and 1,1-DCE. Bioaugmentation of the soil with CB1190 resulted in nearly complete degradation at influent concentrations of 3–10 mg L⁻¹ 1,4-dioxane and a residence reaction time of 40–80 h, but the presence of co-contaminants, 1,1-DCE and Cu²⁺ ions (up to 10 mg L⁻¹), partially inhibited 1,4-dioxane degradation in the untreated and bioaugmented soil columns. However, the inhibitory effects were much less severe in the column flow-through systems than those previously observed in planktonic cultures, which showed near complete inhibition at the same co-contaminant concentrations. These observations demonstrate a low susceptibility of soil microbes to the toxicity of 1,1-DCE and Cu²⁺ in packed soil flow-through systems, and thus have important implications for predicting biodegradation potential and developing sustainable, cost-effective technologies for in situ remediation of 1,4-dioxane contaminated soils and groundwater.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPseudonocardia 3aaerobic conditions 3abacteria 3abioaugmentation 3abiodegradation 3acopper 3acost effectiveness 3adechlorination 3adioxane 3agroundwater 3aions 3aplankton 3apolluted soils 3aprediction 3aquartz 3asoil microorganisms 3atoxicity 0aBiotransformation 0aCyclic ether 0aInhibition 0aChlorinated solvent 0aHeavy metal1 aLu, Xia1 aPolasko, Alexandra1 aJohnson, Nicholas W.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0692-41781 aMiao, Yu1 aYang, Ziming1 aMahendra, Shaily1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3298-96021 aGu, Baohua1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7299-29560 tEnvironmental pollution.g2018 Dec., v. 243 p.573-581dElsevier LtdaElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl41014x0269-74917nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2018.09.0183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02020naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094024002200132024001900154040001800173100005400191245009100245506007600336520066200412592002801074506003701102650001701139650002901156650001701185650002001202650001401222650001401236651001001250653001801260653002701278653001501305700001701320700001701337700001801354700001401372773011901386856008401505852000901589655001201598IND60638180820221207113505.0190426e201808  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063818082DNAL7 a10.1016/j.PAREPI.2018.e000692doi7 aPMC60201052pmcid7 a299883342pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZala, D.B.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8393-001610aCirculation of dengue serotypes in the Union Territory of Dadra & Nagar Haveli (India)  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe presence of chronological infection by the multi serotype of dengue virus (DENV) is a major contributing factor for the induction of Dengue Hemorrhagic Fever (DHF) and Dengue Shock Syndrome (DSS).

The study was conducted during 2014–2017 in the Union Territory of Dadra & Nagar Haveli (India).  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDengue virus 3adengue hemorrhagic fever 3aepidemiology 3amixed infection 3aparasites 3aserotypes 3aIndia 0aDENV serotype 0aMolecular epidemiology 0aFlavivirus1 aKhan, Vikram1 aKakadiya, M.1 aSanghai, A.A.1 aDas, V.K.0 tParasite epidemiology and control.g2018 Aug., v. 3, no. 3 p.e00069-dElsevier LtdwJournal:23217x2405-67317nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.PAREPI.2018.e000693Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02982naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245018900170520137600359592002801735650004401763650002601807650001501833650001901848650001401867650001801881650001501899650001401914650001101928650001201939650002201951653002601973653002201999653004102021653003002062653002102092700001802113700001602131700001702147700001702164700001602181700001702197700001602214700001902230700001802249773011402267856008602381852000902467655001202476IND60720007620221122043621.0210715e20210315xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072000762DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhazmat.2020.1246952doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFeng, Xiaoshan10aBoosting total oxidation of propane over CeO2@Co3O4 nanofiber catalysts prepared by multifluidic coaxial electrospinning with continuous grain boundary and fast lattice oxygen mobility  aA one-dimensional (1D) core-shell of Co-Ce oxide has been prepared by multifluidic coaxial electrospinning method and evaluated for the total oxidation of propane (C₃H₈). Activity and morphological characterizations show that the CeO₂@Co₃O₄ nanofiber catalyst, of which the core is CeO₂ and the shell is Co₃O₄, exhibits excellent oxidation activity. The exposed Co₃O₄ grown on the outside of the fibers can rapidly react with C₃H₈ while CeO₂ with high oxygen storage capacity in the inside is conductive to the enhanced oxidation rate. Besides, the continuous grain boundary provides a fast mass transfer channel for lattice oxygen, and rich oxygen vacancies favor the mobility of active oxygen species. In situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTs) confirms that the CeO₂@Co₃O₄ catalyst have a faster rate of C₃H₈ adsorption and better oxidation activity with respect to the counterpart using a single-needle electrospinning method. Moreover, the CeO₂@Co₃O₄ catalyst displays excellent thermal stability, and strong resistance against 5 vol% H₂O and 5 vol% CO₂ at both 300 and 400 °C. Our strategy can give some new insights into morphological engineering to promote active oxygen mobility via the construction of one-dimensional core-shell of metal oxides for catalytic oxidation of VOCs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aactive oxygen species 3aadsorption 3acarbon dioxide 3acatalysts 3amass transfer 3ananofibers 3aoxidation 3aoxygen 3apropane 3athermal stability 0aCeO2@Co3O4 nanofibers 0aPropane oxidation 0aMultifluidic coaxial electrospinning 0aContinuous grain boundary 0aOxygen vacancies1 aLuo, Fenqiang1 aChen, Yinye1 aLin, Daifeng1 aLuo, Yongjin1 aXiao, Liren1 aLiu, Xinping1 aSun, Xiaoli1 aQian, Qingrong1 aChen, Qinghua0 tJournal of hazardous materials.g2021 Mar. 15, v. 406 p.124695-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6200x0304-38947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2020.1246953Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01653naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100002100112245008900133300001400222500001900236520068800255592002800943650001100971650001000982650002200992650001001014650001501024650002001039653001701059653001901076653003701095653001001132700001901142773014501161852000901306655001201315IND60716697720221120205106.0201107e201706  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071669772DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPatil, Manjunath10aIntramedullary interlocking nail for repair of unstable femoral fractures in puppies  ap. 27-31.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe study was conducted to evaluate the technique of intramedullary interlocking nail (IILN) in eight clinical cases of femur fracture in puppies aged 2 m to 1 yr.

However, deeper genomic analysis revealed a complex symbiosis acquisition history in the beta-rhizobia that clearly separates the mimosoid and papilionoid nodulating groups. Mimosoid-nodulating beta-rhizobia have nod genes tightly clustered in the nodBCIJHASU operon, whereas papilionoid-nodulating Burkholderia have nodUSDABC and nodIJ genes, although their arrangement is not canonical because the nod genes are subdivided by the insertion of nif and other genes. Furthermore, the papilionoid Burkholderia spp. contain duplications of several nod and nif genes. The Burkholderia nifHDKEN and fixABC genes are very closely related to those found in free-living diazotrophs. In contrast, nifA is highly divergent between both groups, but the papilionoid species nifA is more similar to alpha-rhizobia nifA than to other groups. Surprisingly, for all Burkholderia, the fixNOQP and fixGHIS genes required for cbb3 cytochrome oxidase production and assembly are missing. In contrast, symbiotic Cupriavidus strains have fixNOQPGHIS genes, revealing a divergence in the evolution of two distinct electron transport chains required for nitrogen fixation within the beta-rhizobia.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBurkholderia 3aCupriavidus 3aancestry 3acytochrome-c oxidase 3aelectron transfer 3agenomics 3amultilocus sequence typing 3anitrogen fixation 3anitrogen-fixing bacteria 3anodulation 3aoperon 3aphylogeny 3aribosomal RNA 3asymbiosis1 aBriscoe, Leah1 aMartínez-Hidalgo, Pilar1 aAgapakis, Christina M.1 ade-los Santos, Paulina Estrada1 aSeshadri, Rekha1 aReeve, Wayne1 aWeinstock, George1 aO’Hara, Graham1 aHowieson, John G.1 aHirsch, Ann M.0 tMolecular plant-microbe interactions.g2016 Aug., v. 29, no. 8 p.609-619dMolecular Plant-Microbe Interactionsx0894-02827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094%2FMPMI-05-16-0091-R3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02459naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100006000147245011300207300001300320520107000333592002801403650002601431650002001457650001001477650001801487650001801505650000901523650004301532650001201575650002401587650001501611650001801626653001801644653002701662653001301689653001201702653001001714700001601724700001801740700005601758773010901814856008101923852000902004655001202013IND60529797520221123003938.0161020e20160505xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052979752DNAL7 a10.1016/j.mce.2016.02.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 avan de Vyver, M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0861-293910aDelayed wound healing and dysregulation of IL6/STAT3 signalling in MSCs derived from pre-diabetic obese mice  ap. 1-10.  aMetabolic dysfunction that occurs in obesity and Type 2 diabetes results in a low-level inflammatory state which impacts on mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) capacity to promote wound healing. The ability of either recombinant Interleukin-6 (rIL6) or pioglitazone to modulate MSC migration, essential for wound healing, by targeting the inflammation-modulated IL6/STAT3 signalling pathway was therefore investigated in bone marrow-derived MSCs from control (C57BL/6J) and pre-diabetic obese mice (B6. Cg-Lepob/J). The population doubling time, in vitro wound closure and mRNA expression profile of 84 genes involved in the IL6/STAT3 signalling pathway were assessed. IL6/STAT3 signalling dysregulation, caused by IL6 deficiency, resulted in skewing of the immune modulatory properties of MSCs to favour a pro-inflammatory profile. This could be nullified by addition of either rIL6 or conventional diabetes treatment. Therapies to improve diabetic wound healing should therefore focus on the cellular changes induced by the pathological inflammatory micro-environment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal disease models 3agene expression 3agenes 3ainterleukin-6 3amessenger RNA 3amice 3anoninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus 3aobesity 3asignal transduction 3astem cells 3atissue repair 0aInterleukin-6 0aMesenchymal stem cells 0aDiabetes 0aObesity 0aSTAT31 aNiesler, C.1 aMyburgh, K.H.1 aFerris, W.F.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4515-52390 tMolecular and Cellular Endocrinology.g2016 May 05, v. 426 p.1-10dElsevier Ireland Ltdx0303-72077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.mce.2016.02.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03615naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094024002200127024001900149040001800168100006000186245016700246300001800413506007600431520207900507592002802586506003702614650005302651650001302704650001602717650001302733650001802746650003602764650003502800650002402835651001802859700002202877700001902899700002302918700002402941773014002965856007903105852000903184655001203193IND60645118120221207122211.0190523e20190419xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064511812DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.est.9b004712doi7 aPMC65567782pmcid7 a310022432pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSjödin, Andreas1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0997-575810aPolybrominated Diphenyl Ethers and Biphenyl in Serum: Time Trend Study from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey for Years 2005/06 through 2013/14  ap. 6018-6024.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aEleven polybrominated diphenyl ether (tri- to deca-BDE) congeners and 2,2′,4,4′,5,5′-hexabromobiphenyl (BB153) have been measured in pooled serum samples from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) for one decade (from survey years 2005/06 through 2013/14). The pools, which are representative of the general noninstitutionalized population of the United States, encompassed thirty-two demographic groups defined by sex, race/ethnicity (Mexican American, non-Hispanic black, non-Hispanic white, and all other race/ethnicities), and age (12–19, >20–39, >40–59, and ≥60 years). The adjusted geometric means were determined in a multiple linear regression model for the six congeners (BDE28, BDE47, BDE99, BDE100, BDE153, and BB153) with detectable concentrations in at least 60% of pools in each of the thirty-two demographic groups; the level of significance for all statistical comparisons thereof were determined. BDE154 and BDE209 were detected in 60% of the NHANES 2011/12 and 2013/14 pools; only these two survey periods were evaluated for these congeners. The percent change in concentration by a 2-year survey period was calculated. All examined PBDEs reported in five survey periods decreased in concentration, except BDE153, for which concentrations increased by 12.0% (95% CI 7.1–16.4) and 8.4% (95% CI 2.9–14.1) for the age groups 40–59 and ≥60 years, respectively; no significant change was observed in younger age groups. Excluding BDE153, we observed larger percentage decreases by a 2-year survey period for the age groups 12–19, 20–39, and ≥60 years compared with the age group 40–59 years. The percentage decrease by a two-year survey period ranged between −19.6% (BDE99, 20–39 years old) and −4.5% (BDE100, 40–59 years old). Although five polybrominated diphenyl ether (PDBE) congeners and BB153 are still frequently detected in the U.S. general population, PBDE concentrations have decreased since 2005–2006, likely, because of changes in manufacturing practices that started in the mid-2000s.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aNational Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 3abiphenyl 3ablood serum 3ageometry 3amanufacturing 3anationalities and ethnic groups 3apolybrominated diphenyl ethers 3aregression analysis 3aUnited States1 aJones, Richard S.1 aWong, Lee-Yang1 aCaudill, Samuel P.1 aCalafat, Antonia M.0 tEnvironmental science & technology.g2019 Apr. 19, v. 53, no. 10 p.6018-6024dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23339x1520-58517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.est.9b004713Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02262naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002000148245006900168300001600237520115900253592002801412650001801440650002801458650001801486650001301504650002601517650001301543650001401556650000901570650001501579650001901594650001201613700001501625700002301640773013201663856008401795852000901879655001201888IND60549012020221121070616.0160906e201608  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054901202DNAL7 a10.1094/MPMI-05-16-0103-CR2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMiyashita, Yuri10aTrade-Offs for Viruses in Overcoming Innate Immunities in Plants  ap. 595-598.  aPlants recognize viral infection via an immune receptor, i.e., nucleotide-binding site (NB)-leucine-rich repeat (LRR) proteins. Another immune receptor, receptor-like kinase proteins, which share an LRR domain with NB-LRRs, perceive conserved molecules of pathogens called pathogen- or microbe-associated molecular patterns, but NB-LRRs generally perceive particular viral proteins. As viruses can evolve more rapidly than the host immune system, how do plant immune systems, which rely on the perception of proteins, remain effective? Viral adaptive evolution may be controlled by penalties that result from mutations in viral proteins that are perceived by NB-LRRs. Our recent studies in pea (Pisum sativum) suggest a penalty of increased susceptibility to another immune system. When a viral protein mutates to evade one immune system, the virus with the mutated protein becomes more susceptible to another. Such antagonistic pleiotropy of a viral protein by two independent plant immune systems may have precedents. Plants may rely on pairs of immune systems to constrain adaptive evolution by viruses and thereby maintain durable antiviral immunity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPisum sativum 3aevolutionary adaptation 3aimmune system 3aimmunity 3aimmunologic receptors 3amutation 3apathogens 3apeas 3apleiotropy 3aviral proteins 3aviruses1 aAtsumi, Go1 aNakahara, Kenji S.0 tMolecular plant-microbe interactions.g2016 Aug., v. 29, no. 8 p.595-598dMolecular Plant-Microbe Interactionsx0894-02827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094%2FMPMI-05-16-0103-CR3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03688naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100005800149245019600207300001600403520185700419592002802276650001802304650001902322650002602341650001102367650002502378650002002403650002302423650001002446650002002456650002202476650001502498650002502513650001702538650002202555650002002577650000902597651001502606651001202621651001602633651001802649651001402667653001502681653001802696653002202714653001602736653001902752700001902771700002302790700002502813700001702838700001802855773013202873856008403005852000903089655001203098IND60606231520221119174401.0190219e201602  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060623152DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jembe.2015.11.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWeigelt, Ronny1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6531-993110aFirst time DNA barcoding of the common shipworm Teredo navalis Linnaeus 1758 (Mollusca: Bivalvia: Teredinidae): Molecular-taxonomic investigation and identification of a widespread wood-borer  ap. 154-162.  aThe common shipworm Teredo navalis is one of the most widespread marine wood-boring bivalves of the world and probably one of the most wood destructive and cost-incurring marine invertebrates. First reports on T. navalis for Europe date back to 1731 for the North Sea (The Netherlands) and to 1835 for the Baltic Sea (Germany). It is still unclear, however, where this species originates from. Therefore, T. navalis is considered cryptogenic for European waters, including the Baltic Sea.In this study, 181 specimens of Teredinidae from six different sampling areas all over Europe and North America were molecular-taxonomically investigated using several molecular markers, two nuclear (18S/28S) as well as one mitochondrial marker (cytochrome c oxidase subunit I, hereafter COI). For the COI gene amplification, a new specific primer pair (Ter fw II/Ter rev I) for T. navalis was developed, which allowed sequencing of a 675bp COI gene fragment for the first time. For amplifying the COI gene fragment of other examined teredinids than T. navalis, a third primer (Ter fw III) was designed. These three new primers are valuable tools to identify teredinid species with the DNA barcoding approach.Classification of T. navalis into the system of wood-boring bivalves using a combined 18S/28S dataset showed no differentiation between specimens from Europe and the North American East Coast. The results of the COI dataset analyses showed high haplotype diversity in combination with a low nucleotide diversity and a star-shaped network with a predominant haplotype occurring in all investigated regions. Moreover, no indications have been found on a sibling species in the Baltic Sea. The data indicate a recent population expansion for the examined sampling sites whereas the origin of the assumed worldwide distributed species T. navalis remains open.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA barcoding 3aTeredo navalis 3aaquatic invertebrates 3acoasts 3acytochrome-c oxidase 3adata collection 3agene amplification 3agenes 3agenetic markers 3agenetic variation 3ahaplotypes 3ahybridization probes 3amitochondria 3apopulation growth 3asibling species 3awood 3aBaltic Sea 3aGermany 3aNetherlands 3aNorth America 3aNorth Sea 0aBaltic Sea 0aCOI barcoding 0aGenetic diversity 0aTeredinidae 0aTeredo navalis1 aLippert, Heike1 aBorges, Luisa M.S.1 aAppelqvist, Christin1 aKarsten, Ulf1 aBastrop, Ralf0 tJournal of experimental marine biology and ecology.g2016 Feb., v. 475 p.154-162dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11705x0022-09817nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jembe.2015.11.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03107naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100005800147245015500205300001200360520173500372592002802107650002202135650001402157650001102171650001702182650001902199650002102218650002102239650001602260650002202276650001502298650001102313650001202324650001802336650002302354650002202377650001002399651002302409651001402432773013602446856008202582852000902664655001202673IND60666680120221120221547.0191003e201909  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066668012DNAL7 a10.1007/s12665-019-8504-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBorchardt, Sue1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9577-768510aAre high-capacity wells mitigating or intensifying climate change effects on stream baseflow in the state of Wisconsin (USA)? A case study 1984–2014  ap. 566.  aBaseflow is generally cooler in temperature and of better quality than storm flow, and it maintains stream flow during dry periods. Decreases in baseflow levels and increases in stream temperatures lead to decreases in the diversity of aquatic species. Agricultural irrigation was once almost exclusively practiced in the arid western portion of the United States, but in the past few decades, the use of irrigation has accelerated in the humid Great Lakes region of the United States. In Wisconsin, the number of high-capacity wells increased substantially from less than 4000 in 1983 to over 16,000 in 2014. With precipitation generally increasing in the second half of the twentieth century and projected to increase through the twenty-first century in Wisconsin, baseflow would be expected to increase as well. However, there are areas in Wisconsin where baseflow has declined. This study found that as the number of wells withdrawing from the confined aquifer increased, the baseflow tread increased from a declining trend of approximately 15% to an increasing trend of almost 67%. This increase illustrates a mitigating effect to the decreasing trend related to climate variables alone. As the number of wells withdrawing from an unconfined aquifer increases, the already declining baseflow trend intensified from 18% to over 28%, illustrating the contribution high-capacity wells have in basin baseflow decline in areas where aquifers are connected to surface water. This study highlights that environmental stresses are related to baseflow declines across the state of Wisconsin and that the decreases are being mitigated or completely reversed by the addition of groundwater to the surface from below the confining layer.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaquatic organisms 3abase flow 3abasins 3acase studies 3aclimate change 3aclimatic factors 3aconfined aquifer 3agroundwater 3airrigated farming 3airrigation 3astorms 3astreams 3asurface water 3aunconfined aquifer 3awater temperature 3awells 3aGreat Lakes region 3aWisconsin0 tEnvironmental earth sciences.g2019 Sept., v. 78, no. 18 p.566-566dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:J000001228x1866-62807nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12665-019-8504-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02678naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094024002200121024001900143040001800162100001800180245011700198300001800315506007600333520122500409592002801634506003701662650001601699650002301715650002401738650002001762650001301782650003901795650003001834650001201864650001801876650002601894650003701920700001801957700002001975700002601995700002402021773010302045856007502148852000902223655001202232IND60531313220221207051802.0160723e20131217xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053131322DNAL7 a10.1021/bi401284r2doi7 aPMC39003242pmcid7 a242892462pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSterner, Eric10aFGF–FGFR Signaling Mediated through Glycosaminoglycans in Microtiter Plate and Cell-Based Microarray Platforms  ap. 9009-9019.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aFibroblast growth factor (FGF) signals cell growth through its interaction with a fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) and a glycosaminoglycn (GAG) coreceptor. Here, we examine the signaling of five different FGFs (1, 2, 6, 8, and 8b) through FGFR3c. A small library of GAG and GAG-derivative coreceptors are screened to understand better the structure–activity relationship of these coreceptors on signaling. Initially, data were collected in a microtiter plate well-based cell proliferation assay. In an effort to reduce reagent requirements and improve assay throughput, a cell-based microarray platform was developed. In this cell-based microarray, FGFR3c-expressing cells were printed in alginate hydrogel droplets of ∼30 nL and incubated with FGF and GAG. Heparin was the most effective GAG coreceptor for all FGFs studied. Other GAGs, such as 2-O-desulfated heparin and chondroitin sulfate B, were also effective coreceptors. Signaling by FGF 8 and FGF 8b showed the widest tolerance for coreceptor structure. Finally, this on-chip cell-based microarray provides comparable data to a microtiter plate well-based assay, demonstrating that the coreceptor assay can be converted into a high-throughput assay.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3acell growth 3acell proliferation 3achondroitin sulfate 3adata collection 3adroplets 3afibroblast growth factor receptors 3afibroblast growth factors 3aheparin 3ahydrocolloids 3amicroarray technology 3astructure-activity relationships1 aMeli, Luciana1 aKwon, Seok-Joon1 aDordick, Jonathan S.,1 aLinhardt, Robert J.0 tBiochemistry.g2013 Dec. 17, v. 52, no. 50 p.9009-9019dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-49957nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fbi401284r3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02063naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245008900169300001600258520092300274592002801197650002001225650002501245650001901270650002501289650001201314650001801326650001301344650001201357651001101369700002601380700002301406700001701429700002201446700002001468773009601488856008401584852000901668655001201677IND60085222620221119130515.0141101e201104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008522262DNAL7 a10.1016/j.seares.2011.01.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKennedy, James10aEvaluation of the frequency of skipped spawning in Norwegian spring-spawning herring  ap. 327-332.  aBased upon an under-representation of second time spawners on the spawning grounds between 1935 and 1973, researchers have suggested that Norwegian spring-spawning (NSS) herring (Clupea harengus) frequently skip their second spawning event. In order to evaluate this claim with direct evidence, herring were collected over a period of three years from statutory surveys and commercial catches over a wide area covering the feeding, over-wintering and spawning grounds. The development stage of the ovaries was assessed and the intensity of atresia quantified. Only a negligible number of the analysed herring caught were considered likely to skip spawning, thus this phenomenon does not appear to be a common feature of the NSS herring stock at present. In addition, considering the reproductive strategy of herring, it seems doubtful that skipping the second spawning event has ever frequently occurred in this stock.  aPublisher supplied data 3aClupea harengus 3aabnormal development 3aanimal ovaries 3adevelopmental stages 3aherring 3aoverwintering 3aspawning 3asurveys 3aNorway1 aSkjæraasen, Jon Egil1 aNash, Richard D.M.1 aSlotte, Aril1 aGeffen, Audrey J.1 aKjesbu, Olav S.0 tJournal of sea research.g2011 Apr., v. 65, no. 3 p.327-332dElsevier B.V.x1385-11017nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.seares.2011.01.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02318naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001600140245013500156300002000291520133200311592002801643650001501671650002001686650001501706650001101721700001801732700001801750700001201768700001701780773012401797856007401921852000901995655001202004IND60640777120221122023816.0190505e20160621xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064077712DNAL7 a10.1039/c6ra05195b2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYu, Caofeng10aHysteresis nonlinearity modeling and position control for a precision positioning stage based on a giant magnetostrictive actuator  ap. 59468-59476.  aA precision positioning stage based on giant magnetostrictive actuator (PPS-GMA) shows nonlinear displacement when it is used in the field of precision positioning control. To improve the defect, the Jiles–Atherton hysteresis model and the dynamic recurrent neural network (DRNN) feed forward-fuzzy PID feedback control strategy were adopted. An accurate hysteresis nonlinearity model of PPS-GMA was established with the Jiles–Atherton model and its parameters were identified using the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm. A dynamics inverse model of the PPS-GMA was established with the DRNN learning method to compensate the hysteresis nonlinearity characteristic. A fuzzy PID feedback control was used to compensate for the mapping error of DRNN. Using these control methods, the positioning accuracy of the precision positioning stage was improved. The simulation and experimental results show that the Jiles–Atherton hysteresis model can describe the hysteresis nonlinear characteristic of the precision positioning stage, the PSO algorithm has high precision for parameter identification, the DRNN feed forward-fuzzy PID feedback control strategy can effectively eliminate the nonlinear characteristics of the PPS-GMA, which has practical significance for improving the positioning accuracy of the PPS-GMA.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3acontrol methods 3ahysteresis 3amodels1 aWang, Chuanli1 aDeng, Haishun1 aHe, Tao1 aMao, Pengfei0 tRSC advances.g2016 June 21, v. 6, no. 64 p.59468-59476dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c6ra05195b3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01543naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100001400112245012300126300001400249500002900263520046900292592002800761650002000789650002400809650001600833650000900849650001300858650002000871650001600891653001900907653001600926653001600942700001300958700001400971700001600985700001401001773014501015852000901160655001201169IND60716698020221120205020.0201107e201706  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071669802DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSahoo, M.10aEvaluation of liquid nitrogen swabbing for the management of foot lesions in captive Asian elephants (Elephus maximus)  ap. 39-40.  aNALT-AP-4-rerunAP2-fuzzy  aThe present study was conducted on eight clinical cases of foot affections in captive elephants treated with cryotherapy using liquid nitrogen application by swab method.

It is however unclear whether outreach activities increase case detection or merely identify patients before they attend health facilities. We compared adults with cough of >2 weeks' duration recruited in health facilities (1202 participants) or in urban slums (2828 participants) in Nigeria. Participants provided demographic and clinical information and were screened using smear microscopy. The characteristics of smear-positive and smear-negative individuals were compared stratified by place of enrolment. Two hundred nine health facility participants (17.4%) and 485 community-based participants (16.9%) were smear positive for pulmonary TB. Community-based smear-positive cases were older (mean age, 36.3 vs. 31.8 years), had longer cough duration (10.3 vs. 6.8 weeks) and longer duration of weight loss (4.6 vs. 3.6 weeks) than facility-based cases; and they complained more of fever (87.4% vs. 74.6%), chest pain (89.0% vs. 67.0%) and anorexia (79.5% vs. 55.5%). Community smear-negative participants were older (mean, 39.4 vs. 34.0 years), were more likely to have symptoms and were more likely to have symptoms of longer duration than smear-negative facility-based participants. Patients with pulmonary TB identified in the community had more symptoms and longer duration of illness than facility-based patients, which appeared to be due to factors differentially affecting access to healthcare. Community-based activities targeted at urban slum populations may identify a different TB case population than that accessing stationary services.  aPublisher supplied data 0aAdults 0aclinical presentation 0aclose to community services 0afacility-based services 0aNigeria 0atuberculosis1 aLawson, L.1 aBlakiston, M.1 aObasanya, J.1 aYassin, M.A.1 aAnderson, R.M.1 aOladimeji, O.1 aRamsay, A.1 aCuevas, L.E.0 tNew Microbes and New Infections.g2017 Jan., v. 15 p.35-39dElsevier Ltdx2052-29757nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.nmni.2016.10.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02802naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001900144245011500163520143100278592002801709650002001737650001701757650002301774650002501797650001301822650001001835650001201845650001101857650001901868650001701887650001801904650003701922650000901959650001301968650001601981650002101997700002002018700001602038700001702054700001702071700001602088700002002104773012002124856007902244852000902323655001202332IND60766908420221116203652.0220211e20220118xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076690842DNAL7 a10.3390/plants110302462doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKim, Nan Young10aChemical Composition of Salix koreensis Anderss Flower Absolute and Its Skin Wound Healing Activities In Vitro  aSalix koreensis Anderss (SKA) has been used traditionally to treat inflammation, pain, and edema. SKA has anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects, but no study has examined its effects on skin wound healing. Here, we aimed to investigate the effects of the absolute extracted from SKA flower (SKAFAb) on skin wound healing-associated responses in keratinocytes. SKAFAb was produced using a solvent extraction method and its chemical composition was analyzed by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. The effects of SKAFAb on HaCaT cells (a human epidermal keratinocyte cell line) were investigated using a Boyden chamber and 5-bromo-2′-deoxyuridine incorporation, sprout outgrowth, immunoblotting, enzyme-linked immunosorbent, and water-soluble tetrazolium salt assays. Sixteen constituents were identified in SKAFAb. SKAFAb promoted HaCaT cell proliferation, migration, and type I and IV collagen productions. SKAFAb increased sprout outgrowth and increased the phosphorylations of serine/threonine-specific protein kinase (Akt), c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase, extracellular signal-regulated kinase1/2, and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) in HaCaT cells. These results indicate that SKAFAb promotes keratinocyte proliferation and migration, probably by activating Akt and MAPK signaling pathways, and induces collagen synthesis in keratinocytes. SKAFAb may be a promising material for promoting skin wound healing.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSalix koreensis 3aantioxidants 3acell proliferation 3achemical composition 3acollagen 3aedema 3aflowers 3ahumans 3aimmunoblotting 3ainflammation 3akeratinocytes 3amitogen-activated protein kinase 3apain 3asolvents 3atetrazolium 3awater solubility1 aWon, Kyung Jong1 aKim, Ha Bin1 aKim, Do Yoon1 aKim, Mi Jung1 aWon, Yu Rim1 aLee, Hwan Myung0 tPlants.g2022 Jan. 18, v. 11, no. 3dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21620x2223-77477nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/plants110302463Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02265naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001600152245013200168300001400300520091900314592002801233650002101261650001501282650001501297650002501312650001901337650001501356650000901371650002301380650001901403650001101422650002601433653001501459653003001474653001501504653002101519653002001540653001901560700002501579773013201604856008601736852000901822655001201831IND60552862420221119202117.0161021e20150320xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055286242DNAL7 a10.1016/j.colsurfa.2015.01.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDeka, Hemen10aStructural and thermodynamic factors on adsorptive interaction of certain flavonoids onto polymeric resins and activated carbon  ap. 51-59.  aFlavonoids (FVs) are a class of plant secondary metabolites with the largest group of phenolic compounds that have been recognized to possess many biological effects beneficial to health. Adsorption chromatography is best recommended for selective separation and purification of these molecules from plant extracts. Several experimental studies have been reported on adsorptive separation processes for their recovery; however there has been relatively less theoretical study on adsorption mechanism of FVs. In this study, we attempt to elucidate the adsorption mechanism by calculating the interaction energies and heat of adsorption theoretically and comparing them with the results reported by other workers. Such a study is thought to be useful also for deducing implication in design and development of appropriate adsorbent for effective separation and purification of FVs from the extracts of herbal plants.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactivated carbon 3aadsorbents 3aadsorption 3abioactive properties 3achromatography 3aflavonoids 3aheat 3aphenolic compounds 3aplant extracts 3aresins 3asecondary metabolites 0aAdsorption 0aDensity functional theory 0aFlavonoids 0aHydrogen Bonding 0aPolymeric resin 0aThermodynamics1 aSaikia, Monali Dutta0 tColloids and Surfaces A: Physicochemical and Engineering Aspects.g2015 Mar. 20, v. 469 p.51-59dElsevier B.V.x0927-77577nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfa.2015.01.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02095naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100006200149245010400211300001800315520089400333592002801227596006501255596002401320650001601344650001301360650001001373650001501383650001501398650001301413650002101426650002401447650001001471653001501481700002301496773011001519856008301629852000901712655001201721IND60677655920221116232412.0191202e201912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067765592DNAL7 a10.1094/PHYTO-05-19-0163-IA2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKaloshian, Isgouhi1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9873-281010aAdvances in Plant−Nematode Interactions with Emphasis on the Notorious Nematode Genus Meloidogyne  ap. 1988-1996.  aPlant infections by plant-parasitic nematodes (PPNs) continue to be one of the major limitations in agricultural systems. Root-knot nematodes (RKNs), belonging to the genus Meloidogyne, are one of the most important groups of PPNs worldwide. Their wide host range combined with ubiquitous presence, continues to provide challenges for their control and breeding for resistance. Although resistance to RKNs has been identified, incorporation of these resistances into crops and durability of the resistance remains challenging. In addition, progress in cloning of RKN resistance genes has been dismal. Recent identification of pattern-triggered immunity in roots against nematodes, an ascaroside as a nematode-associated molecular pattern (NAMP) and the discovery of a NAMP plant receptor, provide tools and opportunities to develop durable host resistance against nematodes including RKNs.  aPublisher supplied data  a2017-67014-26699cNational Institute of Food and Agriculture  aHatch 1017522cUSDA 3aMeloidogyne 3abreeding 3acrops 3adurability 3ahost range 3aimmunity 3aresistance genes 3aroot-knot nematodes 3aroots 0anematology1 aTeixeira, Marcella0 tPhytopathology.g2019 Dec., v. 109, no. 12 p.1988-1996dPhytopathologywJournal:jnl44575x0031-949X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094/PHYTO-05-19-0163-IA3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03189naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094024002200122024001900144040001800163100002200181245016200203506007600365520144400441592002801885506003701913650002301950650001501973650001601988650001802004650001702022650002202039650001802061650002402079650002802103650002002131650001202151650001402163650002502177650001902202650001002221700001602231700002302247700002302270700002102293700001702314700002002331700002902351700002702380700003502407773012202442856007402564852000902638655001202647IND60650330120221207081128.0190709e20180816xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065033012DNAL7 a10.3390/nu100811002doi7 aPMC61157422pmcid7 a301158302pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLarson, Leila  M.10aApproaches to Assess Vitamin A Status in Settings of Inflammation: Biomarkers Reflecting Inflammation and Nutritional Determinants of Anemia (BRINDA) Project  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe accurate estimation of vitamin A deficiency (VAD) is critical to informing programmatic and policy decisions that could have important public health implications. However, serum retinol and retinol binding protein (RBP) concentrations, two biomarkers often used to estimate VAD, are temporarily altered during the acute phase response, potentially overestimating the prevalence of VAD in populations with high levels of inflammation. In 22 nationally-representative surveys, we examined (1) the association between C-reactive protein (CRP) or &alpha;1-acid glycoprotein (AGP) and retinol or RBP, and (2) how different adjustment approaches for correcting for inflammation compare with one another. In preschool age children (PSC) and school age children (SAC), the association between inflammation and retinol and RBP was largely statistically significant; using the regression approach, adjustments for inflammation decreased the estimated prevalence of VAD compared to unadjusted VAD (range: &minus;22.1 to &minus;6.0 percentage points). In non-pregnant women of reproductive age (WRA), the association between inflammation and vitamin A biomarkers was inconsistent, precluding adjustments for inflammation. The burden of VAD can be overestimated if inflammation is not accounted for, and the regression approach provides a method for adjusting retinol and RBP for inflammation across the full range of concentrations in PSC and SAC.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aC-reactive protein 3abiomarkers 3ablood serum 3aglycoproteins 3ainflammation 3aissues and policy 3apublic health 3aregression analysis 3aretinol-binding protein 3aschool children 3asurveys 3avitamin A 3avitamin A deficiency 3avitamin status 3awomen1 aGuo, Junjie1 aWilliams, Anne  M.1 aYoung, Melissa  F.1 aIsmaily, Sanober1 aAddo, O  Yaw1 aThurnham, David1 aTanumihardjo, Sherry A.,1 aSuchdev, Parminder  S.1 aNorthrop-Clewes, Christine  A.0 tNutrients.g2018 Aug. 16, v. 10, no. 8dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2271x2072-66437nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/nu100811003Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02740naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002400148245011000172300001400282520137800296592002801674650002401702650001301726650001601739650001901755650001701774650002001791650001001811650001301821650001101834650001501845650001301860650001901873650001901892650001501911650001301926650001701939650001001956650001501966650002001981700001802001700001702019700001702036700001502053773008502068856008402153852000902237655001202246IND60549012220221121061516.0160906e201601  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054901222DNAL7 a10.1094/PDIS-01-15-0062-RE2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMartínez-Ferri, E.10aNondestructive Detection of White Root Rot Disease in Avocado Rootstocks by Leaf Chlorophyll Fluorescence  ap. 49-58.  aWhite root rot (WRR) disease caused by Rosellinia necatrix is one of the most important threats affecting avocado orchards in temperate regions. In this study, we monitored the progression of WRR disease at the leaf and root levels by the combination of nondestructive chlorophyll fluorescence measurements and confocal laser-scanning microscopy on avocado genotypes susceptible to R. necatrix. Leaf photochemistry was affected at early stages of disease development prior to the appearance of aboveground symptoms, made evident as significant decreases in the trapping efficiency of photosystem-II (Fᵥ′/Fₘ′) and in the steady-state of chlorophyll fluorescence yield (Fₛ) normalized to the minimal fluorescence yield (F₀) (Fₛ/F₀). Decreases in Fᵥ′/Fₘ′ and Fₛ/F₀ were associated with different degrees of fungal penetration, primarily in the lateral roots but not in areas next to the main root collar. Aboveground symptoms were observed only when the fungus reached the root collar. Leaf physiology was also tracked in a tolerant genotype where no changes were observed during disease progression despite the presence of the fungus in the root system. These results highlight the usefulness of this technique for the early detection of fungal infection and the rapid removal of highly susceptible genotypes in rootstock avocado-breeding programs  aPublisher supplied data 3aRosellinia necatrix 3aavocados 3achlorophyll 3adisease course 3afluorescence 3afoliar diseases 3afungi 3agenotype 3aleaves 3amicroscopy 3aorchards 3aphotochemistry 3aphotosystem II 3aroot crown 3aroot rot 3aroot systems 3aroots 3arootstocks 3atemperate zones1 aZumaquero, A.1 aAriza, M.

RTS is caused by mutations in the RECQL4 gene, which encodes one of the five human RecQ helicases. To identify the cellular functions of RECQL4, we generated a chicken DT40 cell line in which RECQL4 expression could be turned off by doxycycline (Dox). Upon exposure to Dox, cells stopped growing and underwent apoptosis. The cells could be rescued by expression of the N-terminal region of RECQL4 (amino acids 1–496), which lacks the helicase domain and has sequence similarity to yeast Sld2, which plays an essential function in the initiation of DNA replication in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Smaller fragments of the N-terminal region of RECQL4 did not rescue the cells from lethality. RECQL4 gene knockout cells complemented with RECQL4 (1–496) showed relatively high sensitivity to DNA damaging agents that induce double strand breaks and cross-links, suggesting that the C-terminal region including the helicase domain of RECQL4 is involved in the repair of certain types of DNA lesions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aDNA replication 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3aabnormal development 3aamino acids 3aapoptosis 3achickens 3acrosslinking 3adoxycycline 3agene targeting 3agenes 3agenetic disorders 3ahumans 3amutation 3asequence homology 3aviability 3ayeasts1 aYoshimura, Akari1 aHosono, Yoshifumi1 aTada, Shusuke1 aSeki, Masayuki1 aEnomoto, Takemi0 tBiochimica et biophysica acta.

The oxygen-evolving complex (OEC) is located on the donor side of PSII and contains an Mn₄CaO₅ cluster catalyzing water oxidation. A cofactor of this reaction is a Ca²⁺ cation. Lanthanide ions are similar to Ca²⁺ ions in relation to some physical and chemical properties, such as the ionic radius and coordination number. In the case of calcium-binding proteins, Ca²⁺ substitution with these cations is possible. Some representatives of this group of cations are able to bind to the Ca-binding site of PSII. In this study, we investigated an interaction between the donor side of PSII and terbium, one of the least studied lanthanides. According to the obtained results, the incubation of native PSII preparations with Tb³⁺ cations caused an irreversible inhibition (by ~75% for 2 mM of Tb³⁺) of the oxygen evolving function. At the same time, changes in the electron transport at the acceptor side of PSII remained rather insignificant. Supplementation of an incubation buffer with 30 mM Ca²⁺ reduced the inhibiting effect of terbium almost two times. The obtained results agree with the fluorescence induction kinetics measurement in PSII preparations in the presence of exogenous Ca²⁺ and Tb³⁺ and allow for the supposition that terbium cations displace Ca²⁺ ions from OEC. This terbium-induced release of calcium from the catalytic center results in incomplete water oxidation producing H₂O₂ instead of molecular oxygen as it has been shown earlier for PSII in the absence of Ca²⁺ in OEC.  aPublisher supplied data 3abyproducts 3acalcium 3acations 3aelectron transfer 3afluorescence 3aoxidation 3aoxygen 3aoxygen evolving complex 3aterbium1 aLovyagina, E.

Cerebral ischemia and infarction are commonly associated with stroke. Currently used medications, though effective, are also associated with adverse effects. Development of effective neuroprotective agents with fewer side effects would be of clinical value. We evaluated the effects of Withaferin A (WA), a steroidal lactone derived from the plant Withania somnifera, on experimentally induced cerebral infarction.The ability of WA to inhibit neuroapoptosis and modulate vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) migration and PI3K/Akt signaling was assessed. Separate groups of Sprague Dawley rats were subjected to cerebral occlusion and reperfused for 24h.WA treatment (25, 50 or 100mg/kg bodyweight) significantly reduced the infarct area in a carotid ligation model; WA reduced intimal hyperplasia and proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA)-positive cell counts. Western blotting analysis revealed significantly suppressed PI3K/Akt signaling following cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury. WA supplementation was found to downregulate apoptotic pathway proteins. WA suppressed PTEN and enhanced p-Akt and GSK-3β levels and elevated mTORc1, cyclinD1 and NF-κB p65 expression, suggesting activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway. In vitro studies with PDGF-stimulated A7r5 cells revealed that WA exposure severely downregulated matrix metalloproteinases (MMP)-2 and -9 and inhibited migration of A7r5 cells. Additionally, WA reduced the proliferation of A7r5 cells significantly.WA exerted neuroprotective effects by activating the PI3K/Akt pathway, modulating the expression of MMPs, and inhibiting the migration of VSMCs.  aPublisher supplied data 0aApoptosis cerebral infarction 0aMatrix metalloproteinases 0aPI3K/Akt signaling pathway 0aVascular smooth muscle cells 0aWithaferin A1 aGuo, Yu-Dong1 aLi, Hao-Mei1 aWang, Rui-Zheng1 aGuo, Shou-Gang1 aDu, Yi-Feng0 tAdvances in Medical Sciences.g2017, dElsevier Urban & Partner Sp. z o.o.x1896-11267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.advms.2016.09.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01893naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002300147245007800170520089400248592002801142650001901170650002001189650001501209650001201224653001901236653001101255653001301266653001401279653001201293653002301305653001201328700001801340773009401358856008201452852000901534655001201543IND60725300320221122033314.0210223e202012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072530032DNAL7 a10.1016/j.dib.2020.1063612doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAndrews, Talbot M.10aTwo-wave panel survey dataset on who feels affected by Hurricane Florence  aFeeling affected by climate change related natural disasters is an important predictor of engaging in climate change mitigation behavior. We therefore collected data to identify who felt affected by Hurricane Florence, which made landfall in the United States on September 14ᵗʰ, 2018. In the months before Hurricane Florence, we collected survey responses from a nationally representative sample of United States citizens. We measured their attitudes towards climate change, emotional predispositions, and demographic information. Then, in the days after the hurricane, we re-contacted respondents to identify whether or not they felt personally affected by Hurricane Florence. These data can be used first to identify variables associated with climate change attitudes, and second to identify the traits that predispose individuals to feel affected by climate change related disasters.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclimate change 3adata collection 3ahurricanes 3asurveys 0aPublic opinion 0aSurvey 0aDisaster 0aHurricane 0aEmpathy 0aPerspective taking 0aHelping1 aSmirnov, Oleg0 tData in Brief.g2020 Dec., v. 33 p.106361-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:23203x2352-34097nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.dib.2020.1063613Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02456naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100002000112245011300132300001400245500001900259520124800278592002801526650001101554650001401565650001501579650001001594650001201604650001101616650001501627650001301642650001201655650001301667650001601680650001201696653001601708653001401724653002501738700001701763700001501780700002501795700001701820700001901837773014501856852000902001655001202010IND60716696220221120213451.0201107e201612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071669622DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChaudhary, R.N.10aComparison of isoflurane and sevoflurane for anaesthesia in buffaloes undergoing diaphragmatic herniorrhaphy  ap. 93-99.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe study was conducted in 12 adult female buffaloes suffering from diaphragmatic hernia (DH).

DH was repaired under general anaesthesia using glycopyrrholate-xylazinebutophanol-ketamine combination for induction and isoflurane or sevoflurane for maintenance in group KI and KS, respectively. Clinical, physiological and behavioural parameters were observed during herniorrhaphy and blood samples were collected for estimation of haematological and biochemical parameters at different intervals (before rumenotomy, before premedication, 5 min after ketamine, at 15 min and 30 min of inhalant anaesthesia, at recovery and at 24 hr of recovery. No significant difference was seen in sedation score, maintenance score, degree of muscle relaxation and quality of analgesia between groups due to maintenance agent during herniorrhaphy and postoperatively. The recovery and standing with ataxia in KS group were significantly earlier than in KI group. There was no significant difference in haematological and blood biochemical parameters due to maintenance agent. Similar trend continued in both groups. Except for cost, sevoflurane is a better maintenance agent than isoflurane.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadults 3aanalgesia 3aanesthesia 3ablood 3afemales 3ahernia 3aisoflurane 3aketamine 3amuscles 3asedation 3asevoflurane 3asurgery 0aAnaesthesia 0aBuffaloes 0aDiaphragmatic hernia1 aTayal, Rishi1 aBehl, S.M.1 aTiwari, Deepak Kumar1 aKumar, Ashok1 aKumar, Sandeep0 tIndian journal of veterinary surgery.g2016 Dec., v. 37, no. 2 p.93-99dIndian Society for Veterinary SurgerywJournal:2007x0973-97267nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle02361naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001300152245009500165300001400260520100100274592002801275650002001303650002001323650001701343650002101360650002101381650002901402650001801431650000901449650001101458650002801469650002201497650001301519650001401532650002401546700001801570700001701588700002101605700001501626700001701641700001401658700002001672773010401692856008601796852000901882655001201891IND60087728620221120181605.0141102e201112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008772862DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jviromet.2011.08.0182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCao, Fei12aA DNA-based West Nile virus replicon elicits humoral and cellular immune responses in mice  ap. 87-93.  aWhile self-replicating, non-infectious subgenomic flavivirus replicons have been described, most of them are RNA transcripts under the control of an Sp6 or T7 promoter. In this study, using West Nile virus (WNV) as a model, a series of DNA-based reporter replicons under the control of a minimal cytomegalovirus (CMV) immediate-early promoter were constructed, and functional analysis showed that these reporter replicons replicate efficiently in mammalian cells. When the DNA-based WNV replicon was used to immunize mice, NS1-specific IgG antibodies and anti-WNV neutralizing antibodies were both induced. Additionally, immunization with this DNA-based WNV replicon induced high levels of lymphocyte proliferation and enhanced the secretion of IFN-γ. These results suggest that this type of DNA-based replicon can induce humoral and cellular immune responses in mice, indicating that this type of DNA-based replicon may serve as a useful platform for vaccine development and protein expression.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCytomegalovirus 3aWest Nile virus 3aimmunization 3aimmunoglobulin G 3ainterferon-gamma 3alymphocyte proliferation 3amessenger RNA 3amice 3amodels 3aneutralizing antibodies 3aprotein synthesis 3areplicon 3asecretion 3avaccine development1 aLi, Xiao-Feng1 aYu, Xue-Dong1 aDeng, Yong-Qiang1 aJiang, Tao1 aZhu, Qing-Yu1 aQin, E-De1 aQin, Cheng-Feng0 tJournal of virological methods.g2011 Dec., v. 178, no. 1-2 p.87-93dElsevier B.V.x0166-09347nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jviromet.2011.08.0183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02740naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001900144245007200163520119900235592002801434650001601462650001201478650002701490650001301517650001501530650001401545650001301559650001201572650001501584650001801599650001101617650002001628650001801648650001801666650001201684650001401696650001101710650001201721650001501733650001301748650001101761651001301772700002101785700002601806700002001832700002301852700002301875700002001898700002301918700002501941773012001966856007902086852000902165655001202174IND60766907320221116203739.0220211e20220118xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076690732DNAL7 a10.3390/plants110302452doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFidan, Hafize 10aChemical Composition of Pinus nigra Arn.

The lipid fraction was evaluated in unripe seeds, and the cellulose, total carbohydrates, glucose, fructose, and sucrose were evaluated in seedcakes. The major fatty acid identified in the Pinus nigra seed oil was unsaturated linoleic acid (44.2%), followed by the saturated palmitic acid (31.2%). The amount of unsaturated pinolenic (10.5%) and oleic acids (8.8%) was also rather high. The amino acid composition of the protein fraction of seedcakes was also determined. The amino acid composition was represented mainly by asparagine (3.92 mg/g), serine (3.79 mg/g), alanine (3.65 mg/g), arginine (3.32 mg/g), phenylalanine (2.98 mg/g), lysine (2.85 mg/g), proline (2.69 g/mg), tryptophan (2.44 mg/g), valine (2.33 mg/g), isoleucine (2.28 mg/g), and tyrosine (2.05 mg/g). The mineral content (N, P, K, Mg, Na, and Cu) of the seedcakes was evaluated, as the amount of K (8048.00 mg/kg) and Mg (172.99 mg/kg) were the highest in the samples. These findings emphasized the potential use of the unripe black pine seeds in different areas due to their chemical importance and values.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPinus nigra 3aalanine 3aamino acid composition 3aarginine 3aasparagine 3acellulose 3afructose 3aglucose 3aisoleucine 3alinoleic acid 3alysine 3amineral content 3apalmitic acid 3aphenylalanine 3aproline 3aseed oils 3aserine 3asucrose 3atryptophan 3atyrosine 3avaline 3aBulgaria1 aStankov, Stanko 1 aStoyanova, Magdalena 1 aPetkova, Zhana 1 aPetkova, Nadezhda 1 aStoyanova, Albena 1 aErcisli, Sezai 1 aChoudhary, Ravish 1 aKarunakaran, Rohini 0 tPlants.g2022 Jan. 18, v. 11, no. 3dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21620x2223-77477nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/plants110302453Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02928naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094024002200132024001900154040001800173100003100191245010900222300001600331500001500347520148600362592002801848650001501876650001701891650001801908650001601926650001001942650002201952650002801974650001302002650001902015650001902034650002002053650001502073653001502088700002202103700001602125700002102141700001802162700002102180773012902201856008402330990002302414852000902437655001202446IND60090024720221120152033.0141110e201103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009002472DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbamcr.2011.01.0062doi7 aPMC30513522pmcid7 a212239802pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGonçalves, António Pedro10aInvolvement of p53 in cell death following cell cycle arrest and mitotic catastrophe induced by rotenone  ap. 492-499.  a2019-12-06  aIn order to investigate the cell death-inducing effects of rotenone, a plant extract commonly used as a mitochondrial complex I inhibitor, we studied cancer cell lines with different genetic backgrounds. Rotenone inhibits cell growth through the induction of cell death and cell cycle arrest, associated with the development of mitotic catastrophe. The cell death inducer staurosporine potentiates the inhibition of cell growth by rotenone in a dose-dependent synergistic manner. The tumor suppressor p53 is involved in rotenone-induced cell death, since the drug treatment results in increased expression, phosphorylation and nuclear localization of the protein. The evaluation of the effects of rotenone on a p53-deficient cell line revealed that although not required for the promotion of mitotic catastrophe, functional p53 appears to be essential for the extensive cell death that occurs afterwards. Our results suggest that mitotic slippage also occurs subsequently to the rotenone-induced mitotic arrest and cells treated with the drug for a longer period become senescent. Treatment of mtDNA-depleted cells with rotenone induces cell death and cell cycle arrest as in cells containing wild-type mtDNA, but not formation of reactive oxygen species. This suggests that the effects of rotenone are not dependent from the production of reactive oxygen species. This work highlights the multiple effects of rotenone in cancer cells related to its action as an anti-mitotic drug.  aPublisher supplied data 3acell death 3adrug therapy 3adose response 3acell growth 3adrugs 3amitochondrial DNA 3areactive oxygen species 3arotenone 3aplant extracts 3aneoplasm cells 3aphosphorylation 3acell cycle 0asenescence1 aMáximo, Valdemar1 aLima, Jorge1 aSingh, Keshav K.1 aSoares, Paula1 aVideira, Arnaldo0 tBiochimica et biophysica acta.

It is dependent on the coordinated expression of many genes encoding proteins with a role in epithelial transport. We identified cis-regulatory elements for critical genes in epididymis function, by mapping open chromatin genome-wide in human epididymis epithelial (HEE) cells. Bioinformatic predictions of transcription factors binding to the regulatory elements suggested an important role for hepatocyte nuclear factor 1 (HNF1) in the transcriptional program of these cells. Chromatin immunoprecipitation and deep sequencing (ChIP-seq) revealed HNF1 target genes in HEE cells. In parallel, the contribution of HNF1 to the transcriptome of HEE cells was determined by RNA-seq, following siRNA-mediated depletion of both HNF1α and HNF1β transcription factors. Repression of these factors caused differential expression of 1892 transcripts (902 were downregulated and 990 upregulated) in comparison to non-targeting siRNAs. Differentially expressed genes with HNF1 ChIP-seq peaks within 20 kb were subject to gene ontology process enrichment analysis. Among the most significant processes associated with down-regulated genes were epithelial transport of water, phosphate and bicarbonate, all critical processes in epididymis epithelial function. Measurements of intracellular pH (pHi) confirmed a role for HNF1 in regulating the epididymis luminal environment.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abicarbonates 3abioinformatics 3achromatin 3aepididymis 3aepithelium 3agene expression 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3ahigh-throughput nucleotide sequencing 3ahumans 3amale fertility 3apH 3aphosphates 3aprecipitin tests 3aprediction 3aregulatory sequences 3asmall interfering RNA 3aspermatozoa 3atranscription (genetics) 3atranscription factors 3atranscriptome 0aEpididymis epithelium 0aCis-regulatory elements 0aHNF1 0aTranscriptional network1 aYang, Rui1 aEggener, Scott E.1 aLeir, Shih-Hsing1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9524-33791 aHarris, Ann0 tMolecular and Cellular Endocrinology.g2016 Apr. 15, v. 425 p.94-102dElsevier Ireland Ltdx0303-72077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.mce.2016.01.0213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03550naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094024002200125024001900147040001800166100001600184245011000200506007600310520190000386592002802286506003702314650001602351650002202367650001902389650001802408650002002426650001602446650001202462650001002474650002702484650001902511650001402530650002202544650001702566650001502583650002102598650001302619650001602632650001202648650002602660700002002686700001502706700001502721700001802736700001802754700001902772773011902791856007702910852000902987655001202996IND60660481320221207112148.0190823e20190730xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066048132DNAL7 a10.3390/genes100805752doi7 aPMC67237002pmcid7 a313661622pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Yueyue 10aGenome-Wide Identification and Expression Analysis of HD-ZIP I Gene Subfamily in <i>Nicotiana tabacum</i>  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe homeodomain-leucine zipper (HD-Zip) gene family, whose members play vital roles in plant growth and development, and participate in responding to various stresses, is an important class of transcription factors currently only found in plants. Although the HD-Zip gene family, especially the HD-Zip I subfamily, has been extensively studied in many plant species, the systematic report on HD-Zip I subfamily in cultivated tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) is lacking. In this study, 39 HD-Zip I genes were systematically identified in N. tabacum (Nt). Interestingly, that 64.5% of the 31 genes with definite chromosome location information were found to originate from N. tomentosoformis, one of the two ancestral species of allotetraploid N. tabacum. Phylogenetic analysis divided the NtHD-Zip I subfamily into eight clades. Analysis of gene structures showed that NtHD-Zip I proteins contained conserved homeodomain and leucine-zipper domains. Three-dimensional structure analysis revealed that most NtHD-Zip I proteins in each clade, except for those in clade &eta;, share a similar structure to their counterparts in Arabidopsis. Prediction of cis-regulatory elements showed that a number of elements responding to abscisic acid and different abiotic stresses, including low temperature, drought, and salinity, existed in the promoter region of NtHD-Zip I genes. The prediction of Arabidopsis ortholog-based protein&ndash;protein interaction network implied that NtHD-Zip I proteins have complex connections. The expression profile of these genes showed that different NtHD-Zip I genes were highly expressed in different tissues and could respond to abscisic acid and low-temperature treatments. Our study provides insights into the evolution and expression patterns of NtHD-Zip I genes in N. tabacum and will be useful for further functional characterization of NtHD-Zip I genes in the future.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aArabidopsis 3aNicotiana tabacum 3aabiotic stress 3aabscisic acid 3aallotetraploidy 3achromosomes 3adrought 3agenes 3agrowth and development 3aleucine zipper 3aphylogeny 3aplant development 3aplant growth 3aprediction 3apromoter regions 3asalinity 3atemperature 3atissues 3atranscription factors1 aBai, Bingchuan 1 aWen, Feng 1 aZhao, Min 1 aXia, Qingyou 1 aYang, Da-Hai 1 aWang, Genhong 0 tGenes.g2019 July 30, v. 10, no. 8dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27140x2073-44257nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/genes100805753Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02141naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002300145245008900168300001600257506002800273520073900301592002801040506003701068650001701105650001501122650001101137650001401148650001301162650001401175650001301189650001401202650002801216650001401244650001001258651001401268653002001282653000901302653003101311653001501342653001501357653002401372700002201396700001701418773013501435856008001570852000901650655001201659IND60774384320221207075108.0161129e201508  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077438432DNAL7 a10.18343/jipi.20.2.103	2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJabal, Arif Rahman10aProtozoa parasitik pada ikan sidat (anguilla spp.) asal danau lindu, sulawesi tengah  ap. 103-107.  aResource is Open Access  aInfection protozoan parasitic on eels (Anguilla spp.) from Lindu Lake was affected weight eels and health eels.

Though RKN interact with trees, no perennial woody model has been explored so far. Here, we show that poplar (Populus tremula × P. alba) grown in vitro is susceptible to Meloidogyne incognita, allowing this nematode to penetrate, to induce feeding sites, and to successfully complete its life cycle. Quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analysis was performed to study changes in poplar gene expression in galls compared with noninfected roots. Three genes (expansin A, histone 3.1, and asparagine synthase), selected as gall development marker genes, followed, during poplar-nematode interaction, a similar expression pattern to what was described for other plant hosts. Downregulation of four genes implicated in the monolignol biosynthesis pathway was evidenced in galls, suggesting a shift in the phenolic profile within galls developed on poplar roots. Raman microspectroscopy demonstrated that cell walls of giant cells were not lignified but mainly composed of pectin and cellulose.

Furthermore, loading noble metal Pd onto the surface of SnO₂ hollow spheres by an adsorption–calcination process improves the response to 4.88 (250 ppm CH₄) at the optimal dosage of 1 wt% Pd. Meanwhile, the working temperature decreases to 300 °C, showing the prominent spillover effect of catalytic Pd and PdO–SnO₂ heterostructure sensitization as evidenced by the binding energy shift in the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis. The response/recovery time is as short as 3/7 s and the sensitivity is stable for a test period as long as 15 weeks. All these performances show the promise of the highly porous Pd-loaded SnO₂ hollow spheres for high performance methane sensors.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3acoal 3acrystallization 3aenergy 3akitchens 3amethane 3amining 3apalladium 3aporous media 3asurface area 3atemperature 3atin dioxide1 aWang, Zhou1 aZhou, Xinyuan1 aWu, Xiaofeng1 aHan, Ning1 aChen, Yunfa0 tRSC advances.g2018 July 03, v. 8, no. 43 p.24268-24275dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c8ra03242d3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02447naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002300147245009600170520128400266592002801550650001401578650002201592650002001614650002101634650001101655650001301666650001501679650002001694653002101714653002501735653002601760653001501786700002401801700002301825700002801848773009401876856008201970852000902052655001202061IND60725300520221121235934.0210223e202012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072530052DNAL7 a10.1016/j.dib.2020.1063632doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPrézélus, Flavie10aModeling equations and dataset of model parameters for ultrafiltration membrane fabrication  aIn the related research article, entitled “A generic process modeling ‒ LCA approach for UF membrane fabrication: Application to cellulose acetate membranes” [1], a generic model is described and used to obtain the list of material and energy flows as a function of operating conditions for ultrafiltration (UF) hollow fibers preparation by non-solvent induced phase separation. In this data article, equations of the model, a dataset of model parameters and modelled data are detailed. modeling equations are developed from material and energy balances for each unit operation (i.e. from polymer solution mixing to module conditioning) based on an industrial membrane fabrication process of UF cellulose acetate modules. These equations may be reused as such or adapted to other membrane materials and industrial practices. The dataset of model parameters relates to industrial on-site measurements and scientific literature for the existing cellulose-based module. The modelled data corresponds to a reference situation for which hollow fibers (inner and outer diameters equal to 0.93 mm and 1.67 mm, respectively) are fabricated from a polymer solution composition of 20 wt.% of cellulose triacetate, 78 wt.% N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone and 2 wt.% lithium chloride.  aPublisher supplied data 3acellulose 3acellulose acetate 3adata collection 3alithium chloride 3amodels 3apolymers 3aseparation 3aultrafiltration 0aProcess modeling 0aMembrane preparation 0aLife cycle assessment 0aEco-design1 aTiruta-Barna, Ligia1 aGuigui, Christelle1 aRemigy, Jean-Christophe0 tData in Brief.g2020 Dec., v. 33 p.106363-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:23203x2352-34097nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.dib.2020.1063633Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02028naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001400147245013100161300001800292520093800310592002801248650002001276650001401296650002301310650003301333650002201366650001401388650001301402700002401415700002401439700002101463773011601484856008101600852000901681655001201690IND60120925720221119031057.0150212e201402  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012092572DNAL7 a10.1007/s00216-013-7552-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aManso, J.12aA multiple hollow fibre liquid-phase microextraction method for the determination of halogenated solvent residues in olive oil  ap. 1567-1571.  aThe present paper describes a method based on the extraction of analytes by multiple hollow fibre liquid-phase microextraction and detection by ion-trap mass spectrometry and electron capture detectors after gas chromatographic separation. The limits of detection are in the range of 0.13–0.67 μg kg⁻¹, five orders of magnitude lower than those reached with the European Commission Official method of analysis, with three orders of magnitude of linear range (from the quantification limits to 400 μg kg⁻¹for all the analytes) and recoveries in fortified olive oils in the range of 78–104 %. The main advantages of the analytical method are the absence of sample carryover (due to the disposable nature of the membranes), high enrichment factors in the range of 79–488, high throughput and low cost. The repeatability of the analytical method ranged from 8 to 15 % for all the analytes, showing a good performance.  aPublisher supplied data 3adetection limit 3adetectors 3agas chromatography 3aliquid-phase microextraction 3amass spectrometry 3aolive oil 3asolvents1 aGarcía-Barrera, T.1 aGómez-Ariza, J.

Development of resistant cultivars for deployment in different geographic regions requires a comprehensive understanding of the prevalent P. pachyrhizi pathotypes. To determine the pathotypes existing in four East African countries, 65 isolates were tested on 11 soybean host differentials. In addition, the virulence spectrum of isolates collected from the same region over multiple years was compared. The majority of the isolates (54%) belonged to pathotype 1000, which was found in all countries. The pathotypes with the most complex virulence spectrum, which comprised isolates from Kenya and Malawi, were virulent on four differentials. All pathotypes were virulent on soybean genotypes carrying the Rpp1 resistance gene to P. pachyrhizi, but they were avirulent on cultivars carrying the Rpp1b, Rpp2, or Rpp3 gene, as well as on cultivar No6‐12‐1 that carries Rpp2, Rpp4, and Rpp5. Two of the pathotypes were virulent on cultivar UG 5 that carries Rpp1 and Rpp3 and on Hyuuga that carries Rpp3 and Rpp5. The isolates collected from different countries differed in their virulence spectrum across the years. Shannon's index (H) and Simpson's index (S) of diversity indicated that the isolates from Malawi were more diverse (H = 1.55, S = 0.90) while those from Uganda had lower diversity (H = 0.78, S = 0.46). The Rpp genes that were found to provide resistance to all pathotypes of P. pachyrhizi can be employed for soybean breeding aimed at durable rust resistance.  aPublisher supplied data  cLukas Brader Fellowship  cInternational Institute of Tropical Agriculture (IITA)  c2Blades Foundation 3aPhakopsora pachyrhizi 3acultivars 3apathotypes 3aplant pathology 3aresistance genes 3asoybean rust 3asoybeans 3avirulence 3aKenya 3aMalawi 3aUganda1 aSoares, Rafael M.1 aMahuku, George1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8444-86511 avan Esse, H.

The main source of plant C-values is the Plant DNA C-values database of the Royal Botanic Gardens Kew, which currently contains 12,273 estimates. However, it covers only 2.9% of known angiosperm species and has gaps in the life form and geographic distribution of plants. Only 4.5% of C-value estimates come from researchers in Central and South America. This study provides 41 new C-values for the aroid family (Araceae), collected in the Piedras Blancas National Park area in southern Costa Rica, including terrestrial, epiphytic and aquatic life forms. Data from our study are combined with C-value entries in the RBGK database for Araceae. The analysis reveals a wider range of C-values for terrestrial aroids, consistent with other terrestrial plants, a trend toward slightly lower C-values for epiphytic forms, which is more consistent for obligate epiphytes, and comparatively low C-values for aquatic aroids.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAraceae 3aDNA 3aaquatic organisms 3adatabases 3aecology 3aepiphytes 3agenome 3ageographical distribution 3anational parks 3aCosta Rica 3aSouth America1 aDolenc Koce, Jasna 1 aEtl, Florian 1 aDermastia, Marina 0 tPlants.g2022 Jan. 27, v. 11, no. 3dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21620x2223-77477nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/plants110303343Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01493naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001500149245013800164300001800302520031400320592002800634650001300662650001400675650002300689650001500712650001300727650002100740700001400761700001800775700001700793700001300810700001500823700001500838700001300853700001400866700001500880773010600895856008501001852000901086655001201095IND60578942620221122075526.0170815e20150807xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057894262DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.orglett.5b018542doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhu, Yuelu12aA Facile FeCl3/I2-Catalyzed Aerobic Oxidative Coupling Reaction: Synthesis of Tetrasubstituted Imidazoles from Amidines and Chalcones  ap. 3872-3875.  aA facile and efficient route for the synthesis of tetrasubstituted imidazoles from amidines and chalcones via FeCl₃/I₂-catalyzed aerobic oxidative coupling has been developed.

The results of this study indicate that the conflict in the Sosa, North Sumatera, has come to the level of "tension" or "crisis". Base on study, there are three main issues that people felt in the area around oil palm plantations, covering: issues of land, inadequate farming, the number of unemployment, as well as the limitations of basic facilities in some villages. Third problem is not handled correctly when very likely to trigger conflict, both between citizens and the business community as well as between fellow citizens of the community.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aElaeis guineensis 3aInternet 3aconflict management 3adata collection 3alocal government 3arisk analysis 3astakeholders 3aunemployment 3avillages 3avision 3aIndonesia 0acollaborative approach 0aconflict 0aconflict resolution 0aconflict typology 0apotenstial resources1 aRiyanto, Sutisna1 aSaleh, Amiruddin1 aDahri1 aFirmansyah, Adi0 tJurnal Ilmu Pertanian Indonesia.g2014 Dec., v. 19, no. 3 p.189-196dBogor Agricultural UniversitywJournal:27739x2443-34627nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle02012naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100001800112245011000130300001600240500001900256520093000275592002801205650001501233650001401248650001101262650001301273650001501286650001301301650001201314650001201326653002601338653002601364653001901390653000901409700001601418700001801434700001801452773014701470852000901617655001201626IND60716696520221120213421.0201107e201612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071669652DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAhmad, Rayees10aConjunctival grafting with or without corneal scarification for management of deep corneal ulcers in dogs  ap. 109-112.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe study was done on 13 clinical cases to evaluate different surgical techniques for management of deep corneal ulceration in dogs.

The animals were reviewed for 15 days to evaluate surgical outcome and postoperative complications. Success rate was determined by recording the healed cornea using different techniques. Postoperative complication included breakage of the graft, scar formation on ulcer site and varying degrees of corneal opacity in animals of both groups. On the whole good success rate of 87.5% and 80% was observed in group I and II, respectively.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanesthesia 3abreathing 3acornea 3adiazepam 3aisoflurane 3aketamine 3aopacity 3asurgery 0aConjunctival grafting 0aCorneal scarification 0aCorneal ulcers 0aDogs1 aSaini, N.S.1 aMahajan, S.K.1 aMohindroo, J.0 tIndian journal of veterinary surgery.g2016 Dec., v. 37, no. 2 p.109-112dIndian Society for Veterinary SurgerywJournal:2007x0973-97267nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle02503naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001200147245011200159300001600271520141200287592002801699650002201727650001301749650001501762650002101777650001201798650001901810650001301829650001901842650001601861650001501877651001001892700001501902700001401917773010801931856008102039852000902120655001202129IND60477627620221118043657.0151231e201603  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6047762762DNAL7 a10.1007/s11707-015-0507-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSun, Yu10aInfluence of climatic factors on tree-ring maximum latewood density of Picea schrenkiana in Xinjiang, China  ap. 126-134.  aThe influence of temperature and precipitation on maximum latewood density (MXD) was mainly discussed in this paper, based on the samples of Picea schrenkiana from the Manas River Basin, Xinjiang, China. The correlation analysis between MXD and instrumental records from the Shihezi Meteorological Station showed that the MXD was positively related to the mean maximum temperature throughout the growing season at high elevations. Comparatively, the ring-width at low altitudes was limited by the precipitation in May-June. The composite chronology by MXD sequences was highly correlated with the mean maximum temperature in July-August (r = 0.54, p<0.001), which was then reconstructed by the composite chronology. The comparative analysis on the reconstructed temperatures, observed values, and drought indices (Is) revealed that precipitation would affect MXD when the absolute value of Is was greater than 1.5σ (i.e., |Is|>2.5) in the period of 1953-2008 A.D. or close to 1.5σ for 2-3 consecutive years. The response characteristics are linked with the semiarid climate in the study area. In a single year or consecutive years of extreme dryness, the lack of precipitation would limit the thickening of latewood cell walls and thus impact the MXD. All in all, if a MXD chronology is aimed to reconstruct temperature history, the moisture conditions at the sampling site should be considered prudently.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPicea schrenkiana 3aaltitude 3acell walls 3aclimatic factors 3adrought 3agrowing season 3alatewood 3asemiarid zones 3atemperature 3awatersheds 3aChina1 aWang, Lili1 aYin, Hong0 tFrontiers of earth science.g2016 Mar., v. 10, no. 1 p.126-134dHigher Education Pressx2095-01957nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11707-015-0507-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02497naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245011100168520126300279592002801542650002601570650001501596650001301611650001301624650002601637650002701663653002301690653002101713653001201734653001501746700001801761700001601779700001701795700001701812700001401829700001701843700001801860773011401878856008601992852000902078655001202087IND60720006820221121040502.0210715e20210315xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072000682DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhazmat.2020.1246412doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCheng, Haina10aEfficient reduction of reactive black 5 and Cr(Ⅵ) by a newly isolated bacterium of Ochrobactrum anthropi  aIt is important to obtain bacteria with the ability for reduction of dyes and Cr(Ⅵ) since dyes and Cr(Ⅵ) are often co-exist in textile wastewater. In this study, a new strain belonging to Ochrobactrum anthropi was isolated from textile wastewater, and could efficiently reduce Reactive Black 5 (RB 5) and Cr(Ⅵ). The results showed the degradation efficiency of RB 5 could achieve 100% and reduction efficiency of Cr(Ⅵ) was up to 80% within 3 days at initial RB 5 and Cr(Ⅵ) concentration of 400 mg/L and 20 mg/L. Mn²⁺ and Cu²⁺ could enhance the removal of RB 5 and Cr(Ⅵ), respectively. Glycerin, as electron donor, improved reduction efficiencies of RB 5 and Cr(Ⅵ). In addition, reduction mechanisms were further investigated. The results demonstrated that decreasing of RB 5 and Cr(Ⅵ) concentration were mainly through extracellular bioreduction rather than by adsorption. The FTIR and XPS analyses revealed that the O‒H, C‒C and C‒H groups on the cell surface might be involved in the reduction of RB 5 and Cr(Ⅵ). The information gives useful insights into understanding of how the bacterium reduce RB 5 and Cr(Ⅵ). The results indicated that the strain had excellent application prospect for treating industrial wastewater.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOchrobactrum anthropi 3aadsorption 3abacteria 3aglycerol 3aindustrial wastewater 3atextile mill effluents 0aTextile Wastewater 0aReactive Black 5 0aCr(Ⅵ) 0aMechanisms1 aYuan, Mingzhu1 aZeng, Qiang1 aZhou, Hongbo1 aZhan, Wenhao1 aChen, Hui1 aMao, Zhenhua1 aWang, Yuguang0 tJournal of hazardous materials.g2021 Mar. 15, v. 406 p.124641-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6200x0304-38947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2020.1246413Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02523naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001700140245017000157300002000327520113600347592002801483650002201511650003701533650001101570650002301581650002101604650001601625650001101641650001301652650001801665650001401683650002101697650001601718650003701734700001801771700001801789700001201807700001401819700002101833700001601854773012401870856007401994852000902068655001202077IND60640776020221120061507.0190505e20160713xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064077602DNAL7 a10.1039/c6ra04990g2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Huiyuan10aSynthesis of core/shell structured Pd₃Au@Pt/C with enhanced electrocatalytic activity by regioselective atomic layer deposition combined with a wet chemical method  ap. 66712-66720.  aWe report the synthesis of Pd₃Au@Pt/C by atomic layer deposition (ALD) combined with a wet chemical method. Initially, nearly uniform Pd₃Au nanoparticles (NPs) (∼4.7 nm) supported on carbon with a loading of ∼20 wt% were prepared by reducing metal complexes confined in reverse micelles adsorbed on carbon. Next, a Pt thin layer (less than 1 nm) was selectively deposited on purified Pd₃Au particles instead of on carbon by regioselective ALD that likely arises from the coverage of nucleation sites on carbon by surfactant molecules in conjunction with catalytic decomposition of the Pt precursor on Pd₃Au. The resulting core–shell structured material was subject to TEM, HAADF-STEM/EDX, XRD, XPS and electrochemical measurements. Interestingly, Pd₃Au@Pt/C demonstrates a significantly improved electrocatalytic activity toward both formic acid oxidation reaction (FAOR) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) compared with Pd₃Au/C and state-of-the art Pt/C. This study opens up a unique avenue for the synthesis core/shell structured materials with potential applications in catalysis, electrocatalysis, and so on.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3acarbon 3acatalytic activity 3aelectrochemistry 3aformic acid 3ametals 3amicelles 3ananoparticles 3aoxidation 3aregioselectivity 3asurfactants 3atransmission electron microscopy1 aSong, Yujiang1 aLi, Shushuang1 aLi, Jia1 aLiu, Yuan1 aJiang, Ying-Bing1 aGuo, Xinwen0 tRSC advances.g2016 July 13, v. 6, no. 71 p.66712-66720dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c6ra04990g3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03500naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094024002200122024001900144040001800163100001500181245021400196506007600410520161600486592002802102506003702130650005302167650001102220650002002231650002402251650002902275650001602304650001802320650001802338650002302356650001802379650001602397650001102413650001102424650001502435650002102450650001702471650001502488650001102503650001502514650002402529650001902553650002002572650002802592650001502620651001802635700001702653700001502670700002002685773012202705856007402827852000902901655001202910IND60650329120221207125651.0190709e20180815xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065032912DNAL7 a10.3390/nu100810912doi7 aPMC61160622pmcid7 a301117202pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSun, Baoqi10aExploration of the Association between Dietary Fiber Intake and Hypertension among U.S. Adults Using 2017 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association Blood Pressure Guidelines: NHANES 2007–2014  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThis study aimed to explore the association between dietary fiber intake and hypertension risk using 2017 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association Blood Pressure Guidelines. Data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2007&ndash;2014 were used in this study. Dietary fiber data were obtained through two 24-h dietary recall interviews. Hypertension was defined as systolic blood pressure (SBP) &ge; 130 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure (DBP) &ge; 80 mmHg or treatment with hypertensive medications. Logistic regression models and restricted cubic spline models were applied to evaluate the associations between dietary intakes of total, cereal, vegetable, and fruit fiber and hypertension. A total of 18,433 participants aged 18 years or older were included in the analyses. After adjustment for age, gender, body mass index (BMI), race, educational level, smoking status, family income, and total daily energy intake, compared with the lowest tertile, the odds ratios (95% confidence intervals) of hypertension for the highest tertile intakes of total, cereal, vegetable, and fruit fiber were 0.62 (0.52&ndash;0.75), 0.80 (0.67&ndash;0.96), 0.82 (0.69&ndash;0.98), and 0.86 (0.71&ndash;1.04), respectively. Dose-response analyses revealed that the risk of hypertension was associated with total fiber intake in a nonlinear trend, while the relationships were linear for cereal and vegetable fiber intakes. Our results suggested that the intakes of total, cereal, and vegetable fiber, but not fruit fiber, were associated with a decreased risk of hypertension in U.S. adults.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aNational Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 3aadults 3abody mass index 3aconfidence interval 3adiastolic blood pressure 3adiet recall 3adietary fiber 3adose response 3aeducational status 3aenergy intake 3afood intake 3afruits 3agender 3aguidelines 3ahousehold income 3ahypertension 3ainterviews 3amodels 3aodds ratio 3aregression analysis 3arisk reduction 3asmoking (habit) 3asystolic blood pressure 3avegetables 3aUnited States1 aShi, Xiaoyan1 aWang, Tong1 aZhang, Dongfeng0 tNutrients.g2018 Aug. 15, v. 10, no. 8dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2271x2072-66437nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/nu100810913Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02839naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001400150245013800164300001300302520135200315592002801667650001201695650001901707650002301726650001101749650001301760650002401773650001001797650001301807650001901820650002901839650001301868650001701881650000901898653003301907653001901940653002401959653001301983653001801996700001702014700001602031700001702047700002002064700001702084700001902101700001302120773009402133856008502227852000902312655001202321IND60766436620221117033539.0220314e202204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076643662DNAL7 a10.1016/j.renene.2022.01.1072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGuo, Feng12aA ragged porous hollow tubular carbon nitride towards boosting visible-light photocatalytic hydrogen production in water and seawater  ap. 1-10.  aPhotocatalytic water splitting to produce hydrogen, especially seawater, shows great economic value and development prospects to deal with the energy crisis. In this paper, urea and melamine were employed as base precursor materials to obtain four different morphologies of tubular g-C₃N₄: stacked rectangular thin plates with flocculent structure, ragged porous hollow tubes, porous hollow tubes and tetragonal hollow prismatic tubes by simply regulating the heating rate. Among them, the ragged porous hollow tubular g-C₃N₄ (TCN-1.5) exhibit an amazing hydrogen evolution rate of 8683 μmol h⁻¹ g⁻¹ from water, which is 19.3 times that of the massive g-C₃N₄ (449 μmol h⁻¹ g⁻¹), and still maintain a high hydrogen evolution rate (6782 μmol h⁻¹g⁻¹) from sea water. The analysis results show that by controlling the change of the heating rate, the ammonia overflow rate can be effectively controlled to produce abundant voids and pits to form volume defects, which can exhibit higher specific surface area and serve as a highly active center for the catalytic reaction and effectively improve the photocatalytic performance.

The CACE method is based on the metal-assisted chemical etching (MACE) solution but without or metal precursor in the Si etchant (HF:H₂O₂:H₂O), and the Au top contacts, or catalysts, are not removed from the solar cell surface after the etching. The effects of etching time, HF and H₂O₂ concentration, and the HF:H₂O₂ ratio on the b-Si morphology, surface reflectivity, and solar cell efficiency have been investigated. Higher [HF] and [H₂O₂] with longer etching time cause collapse of the b-Si nanoporous structure and penetration of the p–n junctions, which are detrimental to the solar cell efficiency. The b-Si solar cell fabricated with the HF:H₂O₂:H₂O volume ratio of 3:3:20 and a 3 min etch time shows the highest efficiency 8.99% along with a decrease of reflectivity from 36.1% to 12.6% compared to that of the nonetched Si solar cell.  aPublisher supplied data 3aambient temperature 3acatalysts 3agold 3ahydrogen peroxide 3ananoparticles 3ananopores 3aphotovoltaic cells 3asilicon 0ablack silicon 0asolar cell 0acontact 0aantireflection 0aporous 0aselective emitter1 aBarron, Andrew R.0 tACS Applied Materials & Interfaces.g2015 June 10, v. 7, no. 22 p.11802-11814dAmerican Chemical Societyx1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facsami.5b010083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02766naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001800144245008600162300001400248520137400262592002801636650002601664650001601690650001301706650001701719650001301736650001701749650002801766650001101794650001701805650003001822650001501852650001301867650000901880650001101889650001701900653002601917653002101943653002101964700002201985700002402007700002002031700001902051773012702070856007802197852000902275655001202284IND60637799720200924000000.0191216e20190201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063779972DNAL7 a10.2478/auoc-2019-00042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTache, Traian10aPrevalence of infections with Clostridium difficile on potential pathology groups  ap. 21-24.  aEnterotoxins produced by Clostridium difficile cause a series of biochemical and immunological manifestations in the cascade leading to alteration of the enterocitus cytoskeleton, intestinal inflammation and diarrhea that can greatly impair the patient’s biological status. The genome of the Clostridium difficile bacterium shows a series of evolutionary adaptations that can give it a high degree of resistance or adaptability to many known pharmacological classes. Changing the diversity of intestinal microbiota induced by the use of antibiotics creates a favorable environment from all points of view for Clostridium difficile spore activity. The theme addresses in an original way but related to the epidemiological studies presented in the literature a correlative aspect between the pathological group and the infection with Clostridium difficile. From the data presented, there is a direct correlation between Clostridium difficile infection and the use of antibiotic therapy as a curative or preventive treatment. Gastrointestinal and neurological pathologies, due to the use of curative but also preventive antibiotic therapy, are at increased risk for the installation of Clostridium difficile infection. The study presented may be a first step in raising awareness of the rational use of antibiotics and avoiding non-assisted community antibiotic therapy.  aPublisher supplied data 3aClostridium difficile 3aantibiotics 3abacteria 3acytoskeleton 3adiarrhea 3aenterotoxins 3aepidemiological studies 3agenome 3ainflammation 3aintestinal microorganisms 3aintestines 3apatients 3arisk 3aspores 3atherapeutics 0aClostridium difficile 0aresistance forms 0apathology groups1 aChirică, Răzvan1 aRadu, Marius-Daniel1 aGegiu, Gabriela1 aRugină, Sorin0 tAnalele Universității "Ovidius" Constanța.g2019 Feb. 01, v. 30, no. 1 p.21-24dSciendowJournal:21648x2286-038X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2478/auoc-2019-00043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02496naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002300143245016200166300001600328520119200344592002801536650002201564650001301586650002101599650001301620650001201633650002101645650001101666650002301677650002001700650002201720650001501742653001601757653001101773653002801784700001601812700002201828773015001850856007702000852000902077655001202086IND60522337820221119144305.0160602e20140602xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052233782DNAL7 a10.1515/znb-2008-07052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchellenberg, Inga10aStructural and 121Sb Mössbauer Spectroscopic Investigations of the Antimonide Oxides REMnSbO (RE = La, Ce, Pr, Nd, Sm, Gd, Tb) and REZnSbO (RE = La, Ce, Pr)  ap. 834-840.  aQuaternary antimonide oxides REMnSbO (RE = La, Ce, Pr, Nd, Sm,Gd, Tb) and REZnSbO (RE = La, Ce, Pr) were synthesized from the RESb monoantimonides and MnO, respectively ZnO, in sealed tubes at 1170 K.

We conducted field experiments in 2015–2016 to test the hypothesis that attraction of natural enemies to herbivore‐induced plant volatiles (HIPVs), alone or in combination with companion plants, increases crop productivity. Our treatments consisted of bean plants alone or baited with methyl salicylate (MeSA; an HIPV), or combined with coriander (a companion plant), or with both MeSA and coriander. Numbers of arthropods were visually sampled in each treatment. Sentinel aphids were used to measure ecosystem function (i.e. predation). Plant damage and biomass, and the number and weight of pods and seeds, were measured as a proxy for ecosystem services. RESULTS: MeSA and coriander, when alone or combined, increased the abundance of insect predators from six families, reduced herbivore (e.g. spider mite and thrips) populations, and increased aphid predation. MeSA and coriander also reduced damage by spider mites. MeSA with or without coriander did not, however, increase crop biomass or any yield parameters. CONCLUSIONS: MeSA alone or combined with coriander attracted different predator communities, altered pest communities, and reduced damage; however, these results did not cascade down to improve crop productivity. © 2018 Society of Chemical Industry  aPublisher supplied data 3aAphidoidea 3aCoriandrum sativum 3aTetranychidae 3aagroecosystems 3aarthropods 3abeans 3abiomass 3acompanion crops 3aecological function 3aecosystem services 3afield experimentation 3aherbivores 3ainsects 3amethyl salicylate 3anatural enemies 3apest management 3apests 3aplant damage 3apods 3apredation 3apredators 3aseeds1 aSouza, Brígida1 aRodriguez‐Saona, Cesar0 tPest management science.g2018 Sept., v. 74, no. 9 p.2133-2145dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl59519x1526-498X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ps.49103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02858naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001300147245013700160300001600297520137700313592002801690650000801718650002501726650001601751650001401767650001401781650001901795650001301814650000901827650001101836650002101847650001401868653000801882653000801890653001601898653000901914653000801923653001201931653001201943653001801955653001201973653002401985653002302009700001702032700001502049700001602064700001302080700001202093700001702105773009202122856008102214852000902295655001202304IND60544696920221118043018.0160901e20140217xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054469692DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aca.2013.12.0232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShi, Hui10aLocked nucleic acid/DNA chimeric aptamer probe for tumor diagnosis with improved serum stability and extended imaging window in vivo  ap. 138-144.  aAs promising molecular probes for in vivo tumor imaging, aptamers without modification remain problematic due to insufficient serum stability and unabiding imaging window. To address this problem, a novel locked nucleic acid (LNA)/DNA chimeric aptamer probe was developed through proper LNA incorporation and supplemented 3′-3′-thymidine (3′-3′-T) capping. TD05, a DNA aptamer against lymphoma Ramos cells, being used as the model, a series of modification strategies were designed and optimized with different positions, numbers and combinations. It was revealed that the combined use of LNA and 3′-3′-T had a synergistic effect, and with the increase of LNA substitution in stem region, the serum stability of TD05 was gradually enhanced while its affinity and specificity were perfectly maintained to Ramos cells. Particularly, TD05.6 with 7-base pair-LNA substitution exhibited the significantly elevated detection stability half-life from ∼0.5h of TD05 to 5–6h of TD05.6 for target cells in serum. Moreover, a much slower clearance rate in tumor-bearing mice was also observed for TD05.6, thus leading to the greatly extended tumor imaging window from <150min of TD05 to >600min of TD05.6. This strategy might be of great potentials to generate more aptamer probes that are stable and nuclease-resistant for tumor diagnosis in real biological systems.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aanalytical chemistry 3ablood serum 3achimerism 3ahalf life 3aimage analysis 3alymphoma 3amice 3amodels 3aoligonucleotides 3asynergism 0aAAP 0aLNA 0a3′-3′-T 0at1/2 0aFBS 0a% Gated 0aAptamer 0aImaging agent 0aIn vivo 0aLocked nucleic acid 0aNuclease-resistant1 aHe, Xiaoxiao1 aCui, Wensi1 aWang, Kemin1 aDeng, Ke1 aLi, Duo1 aXu, Fengzhou0 tAnalytica chimica acta.g2014 Feb. 17, v. 812 p.138-144dElsevier B.V.x0003-26707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aca.2013.12.0233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03062naa a2200469 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002400075024005000099040001800149100002300167245011200190300001600302500000900318520163700327592002801964650002001992650001202012650002502024650002202049650002902071650001702100650001302117650001202130650001202142650001502154650002702169650001102196650002002207650002002227650001502247650002002262650001102282650001002293650001202303700001602315700002102331773012302352852000902475856009602484655001202580991582142600742620221119025414.0191122e197109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aCAIN7191658202DNAL7 a10.2134/agronj1971.00021962006300050019x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLechtenberg, V.

The implications of these changes with regard to forage yield and nutritional value were considered. Reducing sugars and sucrose were removed from freezedried, ground material by alcohol extraction. Starch in the residue was hydrolyzed by takadiastase. Ferricyanide, resorcinol, and phenol-sulfuric acid procedures were used to quantitatively assay sugars in the extracts. Glucose and fructose percentages increased slightly but significantly from 6 AM to 12 N and declined to 6 PM in second and third growth alfalfa. About three times as much glucose as fructose was present. Sucrose comprised less than 3% of the dry matter, but varied considerably diurnally, generally increasing from 6 AM to 6 PM. Leaf starch increased from 10.2 to 20.3% of the dry matter during daylight hours, most of the increase occurring between 9 AM and 3 PM. Stem starch remained between 4 and 5% of the stem dry matter. In general, all nonstructural carbohydrates studied began to accumulate after 6 AM. Hexoses peaked first in leaves followed by sucrose and then starch. These were depleted in the same order in the afternoon and at night. Peak levels of glucose and sucrose occurred in stems later than in leaves. Leaf stem ratio increased from 1.1 to 1.5 between morning and evening and declined at night.

Regeneration efficiency on WPM containing 1 mg/l zeatin using stem explantsin vitro, was higher than on MS and ACM. In this system, the time required for shoot regeneration was 2 weeks, which was shorter by two weeks than that of previous reports. A strong genotype dependence was observed among the tested nine clones. The regeneration system, we describe here, did not involve the callus phase and thus was less prone to somaclonal variation. When adventitious microshoots were cultured on WPM supplemented with 0.5 mg/l or 2 mg/l indole-3-butyric acid (IBA), root formation was obtained after 1 week of culture. Adaptation of regenerated plantletsin vivo was 100%. This system for micropropagation ofPopulus tremula is expected to be suitable for studies on transformation of genes involved in lignin biosynthesis via modification of lignin content.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPopulus tremula 3abiosynthesis 3acallus 3aculture media 3aforests 3agenotype 3aindole butyric acid 3alignin 3alignin content 3amicropropagation 3aresearch 3asomaclonal variation 3awoody plants 3azeatin 0apoplar 0aroot formation 0atissue culture1 aBajroviç, Kasım1 aİpekçi, Zeliha1 aBoydak, Melih1 aAkalp, Tahsin1 aTunçtaner, Korhan1 aBalkan, Hülya1 aTanrıyar, Hulki1 aÇalıkoǧlu, Mehmet1 aOǧraş, Tijen1 aÖzden, Öznur1 aTulukçu, Mümtaz1 aTank, Turan0 tJournal of forest research.g1998 May 1, v. 3, no. 2 p.123-126dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl3870061x1610-74037nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF027603133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02157naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100002000138245010500158300001600263500001100279520114400290592002801434650001701462650001401479650001501493650001801508650002201526700002401548700002101572700002001593773013701613856007201750852000901822655001201831IND60608316820221120062918.0180807e201808  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060831682DNAL7 a10.1002/fee.18212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHardy, Mathew J10aPurchase, protect, resell, repeat: an effective process for conserving biodiversity on private land?  ap. 336-344.  aREVIEW  aGlobal conservation efforts are increasingly focused on expanding the amount of permanently protected private land, with the aim of preserving biodiversity. These efforts are often constrained by financial resources, particularly where land acquisition is expensive, or where landowners are reluctant to enter into conservation agreements. Purchase–protect–resale (PPR) programs are used by conservation organizations in a number of countries to facilitate the purchase, resale, and protection of private land. We conducted the first systematic review of the literature on PPR and collated information on its use around the world. In total, we found that funds exceeding US$384 million were available for PPR, and over 684,000 ha have been protected to date. We identify the unique attributes of this approach and the challenges of its implementation, and discuss its potential for protecting land unsuitable for other conservation approaches. Our analysis highlights the importance of selecting appropriate properties, and we suggest that insights from the economics literature could help to improve the effectiveness of PPR programs.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiodiversity 3aeconomics 3alandowners 3aprivate lands 3asystematic review1 aFitzsimons, James A1 aBekessy, Sarah A1 aGordon, Ascelin0 tFrontiers in ecology and the environment.g2018 Aug., v. 16, no. 6 p.336-344dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:23083x1540-92957nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/fee.18213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02341naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002400145245013800169300002000307520099300327592002801320650002201348650002301370650002801393650004401421650002201465650001401487650002001501650001601521700002001537700002201557700001901579700001801598700001801616700002001634700002101654700001601675700001701691773012101708856008101829852000901910655001201919IND60559241520171220000000.0161202e20161202xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055924152DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.joc.6b022702doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPušavec Kirar, Eva10aAbsolute Configuration Determination of 2,3-Dihydro-1H,5H-pyrazolo[1,2-a]pyrazoles Using Chiroptical Methods at Different Wavelengths  ap. 11802-11812.  aA correlation between the absolute configuration and chiroptical properties of nonracemic 1,6,7-trisubstituted 2,3-dihydro-1H,5H-pyrazolo[1,2-a]pyrazoles was studied. A series of 16 novel representatives were prepared by Cu-catalyzed [3 + 2] cycloadditions of racemic (Z)-2-benzylidene-5-oxopyrazolidin-2-ium-1-ides to tert-butyl (S)-(3-oxopent-4-yn-2-yl)carbamate, and their structures were determined by NMR, VCD, ECD, and X-ray diffraction. A clear correlation between the sign of specific rotation and configuration at position C(1) allows for easy determination of the absolute configuration of 1,6,7-trisubstituted 2,3-dihydro-1H,5H-pyrazolo[1,2-a]pyrazoles by ECD and NMR. While VCD, requiring milligram quantities, allowed the determination of the correct relative and absolute configuration without additional information from other methods, the stereochemical analysis by ECD required knowledge of the relative configuration derived from NMR at a comparable computational level.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3achemical structure 3acycloaddition reactions 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aorganic chemistry 3apyrazoles 3astereochemistry 3awavelengths1 aGrošelj, Uroš1 aGolobič, Amalija1 aPožgan, Franc1 aPusch, Stefan1 aWeber, Carina1 aAndernach, Lars1 aŠtefane, Bogdan1 aOpatz, Till1 aSvete, Jurij0 tJournal of organic chemistry.g2016 Dec. 02, v. 81, no. 23 p.11802-11812dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-69047nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.joc.6b022703Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02871naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245011800167300001600285520133400301592002801635650002501663650001601688650001701704650002001721650001701741650003901758650002101797650001101818650001901829650000901848650002201857650001501879650001901894650004401913650002501957650001701982653002301999653001702022653001802039653001602057653000902073700001702082700001402099700001502113700001602128700001502144773009202159856008102251852000902332655001202341IND60544697020221118043129.0160901e20140217xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054469702DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aca.2013.12.0242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLong, Lingliang12aA ratiometric fluorescent probe for iron(III) and its application for detection of iron(III) in human blood serum  ap. 145-151.  aA simple and versatile ratiometric fluorescent Fe3+ detecting system, probe 1, was rationally developed based on the Fe3+-mediated deprotection of acetal reaction. Notably, this reaction was firstly employed to design fluorescent Fe3+ probe. Upon treatment with Fe3+, probe 1 showed ratiometric response, with the fluorescence spectra displaying significant red shift (up to 132nm) and the emission ratio value (I522/I390) exhibiting approximately 2362-fold enhancement. In addition, the probe is highly sensitive (with the detection limit of 0.12μM) and highly selective to Fe3+ over other biologically relevant metal ions. The sensing reaction product of the probe with Fe3+ was confirmed by NMR spectra and mass spectrometry. TD-DFT calculation has demonstrated that the ratiometric response of probe 1 to Fe3+ is due to the regulation of intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) efficiency. Moreover, the practical utility in fluorescence detection of Fe3+ in human blood serum was also conducted, and probe 1 represents the first ratiometric fluorescent probe that can be used to monitor Fe3+ level in human blood serum. Finally, probe 1 was further employed in living cell imaging with pancreatic cancer cells, in which it displayed low cytotoxicity, satisfactory cell permeability, and selective ratiometric response to Fe3+.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanalytical chemistry 3ablood serum 3acytotoxicity 3adetection limit 3afluorescence 3afluorescence emission spectroscopy 3afluorescent dyes 3ahumans 3aimage analysis 3airon 3amass spectrometry 3ametal ions 3aneoplasm cells 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3apancreatic neoplasms 3apermeability 0aFluorescent probes 0aFluorescence 0aDyes/pigments 0aRatiometric 0aIron1 aZhou, Liping1 aWang, Lin1 aMeng, Suci1 aGong, Aihua1 aZhang, Chi0 tAnalytica chimica acta.g2014 Feb. 17, v. 812 p.145-151dElsevier B.V.x0003-26707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aca.2013.12.0243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03631naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002300094024002200117024001900139040001800158100002000176245006900196300001500265520216000280592002802440650000802468650002102476650001602497650001402513650002602527650001902553650001102572650001402583650001902597650001202616700001902628700002302647700002102670700002102691700002402712700001902736700001902755700002002774773015202794856007002946856010103016990002303117852000903140655001203149IND60608576420221119161016.0190510e20171025xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060857642DNAL7 a10.3791/560562doi7 aPMC57552172pmcid7 a291557102pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchnauß, Jörg10aDna nanotubes as a versatile tool to study semiflexible polymers  ap. e56056.  aMechanical properties of complex, polymer-based soft matter, such as cells or biopolymer networks, can be understood in neither the classical frame of flexible polymers nor of rigid rods. Underlying filaments remain outstretched due to their non-vanishing backbone stiffness, which is quantified via the persistence length (lp), but they are also subject to strong thermal fluctuations. Their finite bending stiffness leads to unique, non-trivial collective mechanics of bulk networks, enabling the formation of stable scaffolds at low volume fractions while providing large mesh sizes. This underlying principle is prevalent in nature (e.g., in cells or tissues), minimizing the high molecular content and thereby facilitating diffusive or active transport. Due to their biological implications and potential technological applications in biocompatible hydrogels, semiflexible polymers have been subject to considerable study. However, comprehensible investigations remained challenging since they relied on natural polymers, such as actin filaments, which are not freely tunable. Despite these limitations and due to the lack of synthetic, mechanically tunable, and semiflexible polymers, actin filaments were established as the common model system. A major limitation is that the central quantity lp cannot be freely tuned to study its impact on macroscopic bulk structures. This limitation was resolved by employing structurally programmable DNA nanotubes, enabling controlled alteration of the filament stiffness. They are formed through tile-based designs, where a discrete set of partially complementary strands hybridize in a ring structure with a discrete circumference. These rings feature sticky ends, enabling the effective polymerization into filaments several microns in length, and display similar polymerization kinetics as natural biopolymers. Due to their programmable mechanics, these tubes are versatile, novel tools to study the impact of lp on the single-molecule as well as the bulk scale. In contrast to actin filaments, they remain stable over weeks, without notable degeneration, and their handling is comparably straightforward.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aactive transport 3abiopolymers 3ahydrogels 3amechanical properties 3amicrofilaments 3amodels 3ananotubes 3apolymerization 3atissues1 aGlaser, Martin1 aLorenz, Jessica S.1 aSchuldt, Carsten1 aMöser, Christin1 aSajfutdinow, Martin1 aHändler, Tina1 aKäs, Josef A.1 aSmith, David M.0 tJournal of visualized experiments.g2017 Oct. 25, , no. 128 p.e56056-e56056dJournal of Visualized ExperimentswJournal:jnl4469330x1940-087X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3791/560563Available from publisher's site  uhttp://www.jove.com/video/56056/dna-nanotubes-as-a-versatile-tool-to-study-semiflexible-polymers  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02495naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100002000138245005800158300001600216500002000232520122300252592002801475650002901503650001701532650001701549650002001566650001201586650002001598650001101618650001101629650001301640650002201653650001501675650001201690650001101702650001401713650000901727650001401736650001401750650001301764651001101777700001901788773013701807856007201944852000902016655001202025IND60608316920221120062804.0180807e201808  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060831692DNAL7 a10.1002/fee.18072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFisher, Jason T10aWildlife winners and losers in an oil sands landscape  ap. 323-328.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aEnergy development and consumption drive changes in global climate, landscapes, and biodiversity. The oil sands of western Canada are an epicenter of oil production, creating landscapes without current or historical analogs. Science and policy often focus on pipelines and species‐at‐risk declines, but we hypothesized that differential responses to anthropogenic disturbances shift the entire mammal community. Analysis of data collected from 3 years of camera trapping and species distribution models indicated that anthropogenic features best explained the distributions of the ten mammal species included in the study. Relative abundances of some mammals were positively correlated with anthropogenic feature density, and others were negatively correlated. Effect sizes were often larger than for natural features. Increasing anthropogenic spatial complexity, access to multiple habitats, and new forage sources favor generalist predators and browsers, to the detriment of specialists, likely altering ecological processes. This issue has far‐reaching implications: as the oil sands landscape changes so too does its mammal community, serving as a bellwether of future change for energy landscapes worldwide.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanthropogenic activities 3abiodiversity 3abiogeography 3acamera trapping 3aclimate 3adata collection 3aenergy 3aforage 3ahabitats 3aissues and policy 3alandscapes 3amammals 3amodels 3aoil sands 3aoils 3apipelines 3apredators 3awildlife 3aCanada1 aBurton, A Cole0 tFrontiers in ecology and the environment.g2018 Aug., v. 16, no. 6 p.323-328dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:23083x1540-92957nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/fee.18073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02272naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245011700165300001600282520119800298592002801496650002501524650001301549650001501562650001801577650001101595650001101606700001701617700001901634700001501653700001401668700001401682773010101696856008101797990002301878852000901901655001201910IND60093166020221117235318.0141103e20121001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009316602DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cej.2012.06.0982doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhao, Shufang10aThree-dimensional simulation of mixing performance inside droplets in micro-channels by Lattice Boltzmann method  ap. 267-277.  aThree-dimensional multiphase/multicomponent Lattice Boltzmann model (LBM) was developed to simulate the complex hydrodynamics inside micro-droplets generated in micro-channels. Special attention was paid to the ways to generate droplets, which determined the initial liquid concentration and velocity distribution inside the droplets and accordingly made a remarkable contribution to the following mixing performance along the flow development in the micro-channels. Flow characteristics and mixing performance under different geometries and how the differences in configuration influenced the initial status of droplets were illustrated by LBM simulations. The results showed that the effective way to intensify the mixing process was to break up the bilateral symmetric fluid distribution as well as to take full advantage of the internal recirculation inside the droplet during its generation process. It is expected that general guidelines to manipulate the droplet formation and its inside mixing can be brought up through this work. Furthermore, flexible solutions can be simply provided to control the mixing process more precisely by just changing the key geometry of the microchannel.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemical engineering 3adroplets 3aguidelines 3ahydrodynamics 3amixing 3amodels1 aWang, Wentan1 aZhang, Mengxue1 aShao, Ting1 aJin, Yong1 aCheng, Yi0 tChemical engineering journal.g2012 Oct. 1, v. 207-208 p.267-277dElsevier B.V.x1385-89477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cej.2012.06.0983Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle01848naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002500143245017000168300001600338520056300354592002800917650001400945650001300959650001100972650001300983650001300996650000901009650001201018650001401030650001101044653001201055653001201067653001201079653001701091653001401108653001501122700002701137700002601164773015001190856007701340852000901417655001201426IND60522338020221119144030.0160602e20140602xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052233802DNAL7 a10.1515/znb-2008-07072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAbu-Surrah, Adnan S.10aSynthesis of Cobalt(III), Iron(III), and Chromium(III) Complexes with Salicylaldiminato Ligands: Evaluation of the Complexes as Catalysts for Oxidation of L-Cysteine  ap. 848-852.  aA series of new cobalt(III)-, iron(III)-, and chromium(III)-based complexes of the general formula [M(N∩O)₂Cl] (N∩O: N-salicylidene(X)amine and sodium N-(4-sulfonatosalicylidene(X)amine)) (X = cyclohexyl and 1-naphthyl) was prepared and characterized.

The good performance of the conical spouted bed reactor has allowed using a low temperature in thermal cracking (500°C) without defluidization problems, obtaining a volatile stream with a 90wt.% overall yield of C₁₂–C₂₀ and waxes in the first step. The effect of the second-step operating conditions on product yields and composition has been studied using a catalyst based on a HZSM-5 (SiO₂/Al₂O₃=30) zeolite. The influence of temperature in the 350–550°C range and space–time in the 0–8gcₐₜ min gHDPE ⁻¹ range has been studied. An increase in temperature or space–time gives way to an increase in the yield of light olefins, reaching a value of 62.9wt.% at 550°C and 8 gcₐₜ min gHDPE ⁻¹, with the individual yields of ethylene, propylene and butenes being 10.6, 35.6 and 16.7wt.%, respectively. Although the yield of single-ring aromatics increases when both variables studied are increased, the maximum yield obtained was lower than 13wt.%. The yield of waxes (the main product in the first step) is negligible even at low temperatures or spaces-times, which evidences the efficiency of the catalytic step.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaromatic compounds 3acatalytic activity 3achemical engineering 3acracking 3aethylene 3apolyethylene 3apropylene 3apyrolysis 3astreams 3atemperature 3athermal cracking 3awaxes 3azeolites1 aLopez, G.1 aAmutio, M.1 aElordi, G.1 aBilbao, J.1 aOlazar, M.0 tChemical engineering journal.g2012 Oct. 1, v. 207-208 p.27-34dElsevier B.V.x1385-89477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cej.2012.06.1053Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02131naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002500140245011300165300001400278500001900292520096700311592002801278650001101306650001701317650001701334650001201351650001301363650001301376650001401389650002001403650001301423651001401436653001301450653002001463653002301483700002301506773012101529856007401650852000901724655001201733IND60694511720221116184337.0200513e19990201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069451172DNAL7 a10.1007/BF027603182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMatangaran, Juang R.14aThe Effect of Tractor Logging on Forest Soil Compaction and Growth of Shorea selanica Seedlings in Indonesia  ap. 13-15.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe hardness in soil was investigated in four forest areas in Indonesia after a crawler tractor passed over it several times. The hardness in soil, expressed by bulk density, was measured at various depth and various distances from the main track. Recovery of soil hardness was also examined. The bulk density increased markedly by the first and second pass of the tractor, but did not change after the fifth pass. The bulk density was highest just under the main and the log track, and decreased with an increase in distance from the track (0.5 to 1.5 m). The greatest increase in bulk density was observed at the depth of 0–5 cm. The soil hardness tended to show recovery within 9 years after logging, though not completely. Growth and root penetration of seedlingsShorea selanica decreased with the increase of soil hardness. We considered that the 2 tractor passes that caused bulk density of 1.3 g/cm³ is critical for the growth ofS. selanica's seedling.  aPublisher supplied data 3aShorea 3abulk density 3aforest soils 3aforests 3ahardness 3aresearch 3aseedlings 3asoil compaction 3atractors 3aIndonesia 0arecovery 0aseedling growth 0askidding intensity1 aKobayashi, Hiroshi0 tJournal of forest research.g1999 Feb. 1, v. 4, no. 1 p.13-15dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl3870061x1610-74037nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF027603183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02601naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094024002200120024001900142040001800161100002200179245010600201300001600307500001100323506007600334520120600410592002801616506003701644650002801681650002401709650002601733650002301759650002401782650000901806650001201815700002101827700002001848700002201868700002101890700001601911700002201927773013701949856007202086852000902158655001202167IND60608317020221207120917.0180807e201808  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060831702DNAL7 a10.1002/fee.18202doi7 aPMC69618372pmcid7 a319421662pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBriski, Elizabeta10aBeyond propagule pressure: importance of selection during the transport stage of biological invasions  ap. 345-353.  aREVIEW  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBiological invasions are largely considered to be a “numbers game”, wherein the larger the introduction effort, the greater the probability that an introduced population will become established. However, conditions during transport – an early stage of the invasion – can be particularly harsh, thereby greatly reducing the size of a population available to establish in a new region. Some successful non‐indigenous species are more tolerant of environmental and anthropogenic stressors than related native species, possibly stemming from selection (ie survival of only pre‐adapted individuals for particular environmental conditions) during the invasion process. By reviewing current literature concerning population genetics and consequences of selection on population fitness, we propose that selection acting on transported populations can facilitate local adaptation, which may result in a greater likelihood of invasion than predicted by propagule pressure alone. Specifically, we suggest that detailed surveys should be conducted to determine interactions between molecular mechanisms and demographic factors, given that current management strategies may underestimate invasion risk.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aanthropogenic stressors 3aecological invasion 3aenvironmental factors 3aindigenous species 3apopulation genetics 3arisk 3asurveys1 aChan, Farrah T.,1 aDarling, John A1 aLauringson, Velda1 aMacIsaac, Hugh J1 aZhan, Aibin1 aBailey, Sarah A.,0 tFrontiers in ecology and the environment.g2018 Aug., v. 16, no. 6 p.345-353dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:23083x1540-92957nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/fee.18203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04144naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001300152245012700165300001400292520263300306592002802939650000902967650002002976650001902996650001103015650001803026650001503044650002603059650001903085650000903104650001503113650000903128650001803137650001703155650001503172650002303187650001703210650001503227651001003242653000903252653000903261653000903270653002403279653001703303653001203320700001703332700001703349700001603366700001703382773009503399856008703494852000903581655001203590IND60112658620221121000924.0190214e201304  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011265862DNAL7 a10.1016/j.geoderma.2012.12.0162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCasa, R.12aA comparison of sensor resolution and calibration strategies for soil texture estimation from hyperspectral remote sensing  ap. 17-26.  aImaging spectroscopy of bare soils has been shown to have considerable potential for the estimation of properties such as soil texture. However, in order to be able to fully exploit data from forthcoming hyperspectral satellites, information on several issues related to sensor spatial and spectral resolution and range, as well as on calibration and validation issues, is still required.In the present study, images acquired over bare soil in Central Italy by airborne MIVIS (430–1270nm; spatial resolution: 4.8m) and space-borne CHRIS-PROBA (415–1050nm; spatial resolution: 17m), were used to explore methods for the quantitative estimation of soil texture. Extensive soil sampling was carried out for the determination of soil particle size fractions. Soil texture was related to the spectral signature of corresponding CHRIS or MIVIS pixels. The spectral behavior of the soil samples was also examined in the laboratory, by using a spectroradiometer in the 400–2500nm range. Spectra were used to calibrate prediction models for the estimation of clay, silt and sand, through partial least-square regression (PLSR). The impact of several factors on the accuracy of estimation of soil texture was studied, such as spectral range and resolution, the effect of varying soil moisture and the geolocation error. The modality of setting up the calibration and validation data sets was also investigated, by employing either randomly selected or spatially separated datasets. The validity of the models was assessed from several statistics, such as bias, root mean square error of prediction (RMSEP) and ratio of performance to deviation (RPD).Results from laboratory data show the importance of SWIR bands to estimate clay, silt and sand fractions. The tests with remote sensing data show a sufficient accuracy of prediction (RPD>1.4) for clay and sand using both MIVIS and CHRIS-PROBA data, but results vary in response to the modality of setting up the calibration and validation sets. Results were found to be sensitive to the difference in support between point and pixel data and to the geometric registration error, especially for MIVIS data. When using a 3×3 window instead of a single pixel, RPD values as high as 1.85 for MIVIS and 1.75 for CHRIS were found.Despite the lack of SWIR bands and a lower spatial resolution, CHRIS did show a comparable potential to MIVIS in terms of accuracy and of prediction ability. This was probably a consequence of the conditions in which the images were acquired, in which the pattern of soil moisture in the field might have played a role in the discrimination of soil texture.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclay 3adata collection 3aimage analysis 3amodels 3aparticle size 3aprediction 3aquantitative analysis 3aremote sensing 3asand 3asatellites 3asilt 3asoil sampling 3asoil texture 3asoil water 3aspectroradiometers 3aspectroscopy 3astatistics 3aItaly 0aClay 0aSilt 0aSand 0aRegression analysis 0aSpectroscopy 0aKriging1 aCastaldi, F.1 aPascucci, S.1 aPalombo, A.1 aPignatti, S.0 tGeoderma.g2013 Apr., v. 197-198 p.17-26dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl16374x0016-70617nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.geoderma.2012.12.0163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02161naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245006200166300001600228520086400244592002801108650001601136650001201152650002101164650001701185650001301202650002601215650001701241650002001258650002401278650001601302650002301318650002401341650002001365650002001385653001901405653001701424653002901441653002401470653002301494653001401517773008201531856008101613852000901694655001201703IND60637800220221117220819.0190424s1995    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063780022DNAL7 a10.1163/22941932-900014242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWorbes, Martin10aHow to Measure Growth Dynamics in Tropical Trees a Review  ap. 337-351.  aCambial dormancy and annual rings in tropical trees are induced by annually occurring dry periods or flooding. Growth periodicity is indicated by the leaf fall behaviour and is connected with an annual periodicity of shoot elongation. Changes in stem diameter are measured with a dendrometer or by measurable differences in the electrical resistance of the cambium. Dendrochronological methods applied to carefully prepared samples can serve as proof of the annual periodicity of growth zones. For this purpose the following methods have been used: cambial wounding, radiocarbon dating, pointer year detection and regression analyses of ring width and climate data. Although X-ray densitometry and the analysis of stable isotopes in rings of tropical trees promise to provide interesting climatological information, the use of these methods remains difficult.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-radiation 3acambium 3adendrochronology 3adensitometry 3adormancy 3aelectrical resistance 3agrowth rings 3aleaf abscission 3ameteorological data 3aperiodicity 3aradiocarbon dating 3aregression analysis 3astable isotopes 3atropical plants 0aTropical trees 0aannual rings 0adendrometer measurements 0aradiocarbon datings 0aX-ray densitometry 0aphenology0 tIAWA journal.g, v. 16, no. 4 p.337-351dBrillwJournal:6290x0928-15417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1163/22941932-900014243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03438naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002900151245012000180300001600300520179100316592002802107650001802135650001702153650001102170650001902181650002302200650001602223650002502239650001902264650001502283650001002298650002602308650002702334650000902361650001002370650001902380650002502399650001602424651001102440653001602451653002502467653001902492653001202511653001602523653002102539700002202560700002102582700002102603700002102624700001902645773011302664856008602777852000902863655001202872IND60637466120221119084955.0190529e20190720xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063746612DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2019.04.0362doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLavers Westin, Alexandra10aCombining material flow analysis with life cycle assessment to identify environmental hotspots of urban consumption  ap. 526-539.  aUnderstanding the global environmental impacts of local consumption is an area of growing interest among policymakers and consumers. By knowing what products comprise urban consumption “hotspots,” municipalities and consumers alike could take deliberate actions to target and discourage consumption of high-impact products. In this paper, a new method for identifying environmental hotspots of consumption is presented. The main methodological advances are the following: i) material flow analysis of urban areas and life cycle assessment are combined; ii) a 16-year time-series of urban consumption data is used for selection of the most suitable representative products and for trend analysis; iii) representative products are selected systematically from consumption data of 1000 product types; iv) representative products are scaled up to represent consumption of the product groups; v) hotspots are identified by simultaneously evaluating six environmental impacts - acidification, climate change, eutrophication (marine and freshwater), photochemical ozone formation, and resource use; vi) for the case study, hotspots are connected to the city's profiles. The method was applied to the Swedish cities Stockholm, Gothenburg and Malmo and to Sweden in total. Electronics is a hotspot for all the studied areas and all the studied impacts and should be a prioritized product group for action. Fuel is a hotspot shared by all the areas while vehicles is a hotspot in Gothenburg. Meat is a nationwide hotspot, but not for the cities investigated. Gothenburg and Stockholm could collaborate to find effective measures for their common hotspot machinery. Thus, the method can be used to identify hotspots and find which product types could be part of national versus local programs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacidification 3acase studies 3acities 3aclimate change 3acommunity programs 3aelectronics 3aenvironmental impact 3aeutrophication 3afreshwater 3afuels 3alife cycle assessment 3amaterial flow analysis 3ameat 3aozone 3aphotochemistry 3atime series analysis 3aurban areas 3aSweden 0aConsumption 0aEnvironmental impact 0aHybrid MFA-LCA 0aHotspot 0aUrban areas 0aUrban metabolism1 aKalmykova, Yuliya1 aRosado, Leonardo1 aOliveira, Felipe1 aLaurenti, Rafael1 aRydberg, Tomas0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2019 July 20, v. 226 p.526-539dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2019.04.0363Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02462naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100001700138245005000155300001600205500001100221520116000232592002801392650002301420650001601443650001601459650001201475650002401487650001101511650002501522650001401547650001501561650002901576650002001605650002001625650001401645650001501659650002201674700002201696700002001718700002301738700002501761773013701786856007201923852000901995655001202004IND60608317120221120075734.0180807e201808  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060831712DNAL7 a10.1002/fee.18222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHilborn, Ray14aThe environmental cost of animal source foods  ap. 329-335.  aREVIEW  aWe reviewed 148 assessments of animal source food (ASF) production for livestock, aquaculture, and capture fisheries that measured four metrics of environmental impact (energy use, greenhouse‐gas emissions, release of nutrients, and acidifying compounds) and standardized these per unit of protein production. We also examined additional literature on freshwater demand, pesticide use, and antibiotic use. There are up to 100‐fold differences in impacts between specific products and, in some cases, for the same product, depending on the production method being used. The lowest impact production methods were small pelagic fisheries and mollusk aquaculture, whereas the highest impact production methods were beef production and catfish aquaculture. Many production methods have not been evaluated, limiting our analysis to the range of studies that have been published. Regulatory restrictions on ASF production methods, as well as consumer guidance, should consider the relative environmental impact of these systems, since, currently, there appears to be little relationship between regulatory restrictions and impact in most developed countries.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal-based foods 3aantibiotics 3abeef cattle 3acatfish 3adeveloped countries 3aenergy 3aenvironmental impact 3afisheries 3afreshwater 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3ameat production 3amollusc culture 3anutrients 3apesticides 3aprotein synthesis1 aBanobi, Jeannette1 aHall, Stephen J1 aPucylowski, Teresa1 aWalsworth, Timothy E0 tFrontiers in ecology and the environment.g2018 Aug., v. 16, no. 6 p.329-335dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:23083x1540-92957nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/fee.18223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02517naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002200145245009600167300002000263520132600283592002801609650001601637650002101653650002301674650002501697650001501722650001901737650001101756650001501767650002201782650001401804650001401818700001701832700001801849700002001867700002101887773012101908856008102029852000902110655001202119IND60559241920221119063208.0161202e20161202xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055924192DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.joc.6b023092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLohani, Chuda
Raj10aα-Azido Esters in Depsipeptide Synthesis: C–O Bond Cleavage during Azido Group Reduction  ap. 11831-11840.  aα-Azido esters, when treated with dithiothreitol (DTT)/diisopropylethylamine (DIPEA), undergo both azido group reduction to give α-amino esters and C–O bond cleavage to give triazoles. The extent of triazole formation depends upon leaving group ability. Some C–O bond cleavage via triazole formation was also found to occur when a resin-bound peptide, which contained a terminal α-azido ester group, was treated with DTT/DIPEA. C–O bond cleavage also took place when this peptide was treated with PPh₃, PBu₃, or PMe₃; however, in these cases, C–O bond cleavage occurred via either triazole formation and/or hydrolysis of the ester bond in the iminophosphorane intermediate to give betaines. The mechanism that dominated for C–O bond cleavage depended upon the phosphine that was used for azido group reduction. C–O bond cleavage during reduction of the azido group in the peptide was minimized by performing the reduction with PBu₃ in the presence of a symmetric anhydride derived from an amino acid in dry THF followed by the addition of water. Surprisingly, these conditions provided the amine as the major product, while the expected amide was formed as a minor product. These conditions were employed in an improved synthesis of an analogue of the cyclic lipodepsipeptide antibiotic daptomycin.  aPublisher supplied data 3aamino acids 3achemical bonding 3achemical structure 3acleavage (chemistry) 3adaptomycin 3adithiothreitol 3aesters 3ahydrolysis 3aorganic chemistry 3aphosphine 3atriazoles1 aSoley, Jacob1 aKralt, Braden1 aPalmer, Michael1 aTaylor, Scott D.0 tJournal of organic chemistry.g2016 Dec. 02, v. 81, no. 23 p.11831-11840dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-69047nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.joc.6b023093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03236naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001500148245016200163300001200325520175900337592002802096596007502124650002102199650002102220650001302241650001002254650001502264650002402279650003802303650001902341650001702360650002202377650001702399650001402416650002102430650002402451650002402475700001302499700001502512700005402527773011702581856008302698852000902781655001202790IND60743524120221118025324.0220301e202112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074352412DNAL7 a10.1186/s13567-021-00967-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhu, Kexin10aCharacterization and protective activity of monoclonal antibodies directed against Fe (3+) ABC transporter substrate-binding protein of Glaesserella parasuis  ap. 100.  aGlässer’s disease is caused by the agent Glaesserella parasuis and is difficult to prevent and control. Candidate screening for subunit vaccines contributes to the prevention of this disease. Therefore, in this study, the inactivated G. parasuis reference serovar 5 strain (G. parasuis-5) was used to generate specific monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) to screen subunit vaccine candidates. Six mAbs (1A12, 3E3, 4C6, 2D1, 3E6, and 4B2) were screened, and they all reacted with the G. parasuis serovar 5 strain according to laser confocal microscopy and flow cytometry (FCM). Indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) showed that one mAb 2D1, can react with all 15 reference serovars of G. parasuis. Protein mass spectrometry and Western blot analysis demonstrated that mAb 2D1 specifically reacts with Fe (3+) ABC transporter substrate-binding protein. A complement killing assay found that the colony numbers of bacteria were significantly reduced in the G. parasuis-5 group incubated with mAb 2D1 (p < 0.01) in comparison with the control group. Opsonophagocytic assays demonstrated that mAb 2D1 significantly enhanced the phagocytosis of 3D4/21 cells by G. parasuis (p < 0.05). RAW264.7 cells with stronger phagocytic ability were also used for the opsonophagocytic assay, and the difference was highly significant (p < 0.01). Passive immunization of mice revealed that mAb 2D1 can eliminate the bacteria in the blood and provide protection against G. parasuis-5. Our study found one mAb that can be used to prevent and control G. parasuis infection in vivo and in vitro, which may suggest that Fe (3+) ABC transporter substrate-binding protein is an immunodominant antigen and a promising candidate for subunit vaccine development.  aPublisher supplied data  a2017YFD0500102cNational Basic Research Program of China (973 Program) 3aABC transporters 3aWestern blotting 3aantigens 3ablood 3acomplement 3aconfocal microscopy 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3aflow cytometry 3aimmunization 3amass spectrometry 3aphagocytosis 3aserotypes 3asubunit vaccines 3avaccine development 3aveterinary medicine1 aYu, Dong1 aAn, Jiahui1 aLi, Yufeng1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2181-63190 tBMC veterinary research.g2021 Dec., v. 52, no. 1 p.100-100dBioMed CentralwJournal:jnl4152735x1297-97167nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13567-021-00967-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03121naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001900148245013600167300001200303520140200315592002801717596005901745596006601804650001301870650001201883650001601895650003901911650002001950650001001970650002801980650001702008650001802025650001602043650001202059650002602071650002402097650001402121700001402135700001402149700001702163700003402180700001802214700001202232700001902244700001702263700001502280700001802295700005702313773011702370856008302487852000902570655001202579IND60743524220221118025254.0220301e202112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074352422DNAL7 a10.1186/s13567-021-00970-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Yaodong10aDctR contributes to the virulence of avian pathogenic Escherichia coli through regulation of type III secretion system 2 expression  ap. 101.  aPathogens could precisely alter their gene expression to facilitate their survival and successful infection. The LuxR family transcriptional regulator DctR (also known as YhiF) was shown to participate in the regulation of acid fitness and adhesion of enterohemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC) O157:H7. Avian pathogenic Escherichia coli (APEC) causes significant economic losses to the poultry industries and also potentially threatens human health. However, the effects of DctR on the fitness and virulence of APEC have not been investigated yet. To assess the function of DctR in APEC, the dctR gene mutant and complemented strains were constructed and biologically characterized. Our results show that inactivation of the dctR gene led to decreased biofilm formation, diminished serum resistance, reduced adherence capacity, attenuated colonization and virulence of APEC in ducks. The altered capacities of the mutant strain were restored by genetic complementation. In addition, we found that DctR positively regulates the expression of E. coli type III secretion system 2 (ETT2) core genes in APEC. The expression of the inflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL)-1β and IL-8 were decreased in HD-11 macrophages infected with the mutant strain compared with the wild-type strain. These observations indicate that regulator DctR contributes to the virulence of APEC through regulation of ETT2 expression.  aPublisher supplied data  a31972654cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a2019PJD057cProgram of Shanghai Academic Research Leader (CN) 3aadhesion 3abiofilm 3ablood serum 3aenterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli 3agene expression 3agenes 3agenetic complementation 3ahuman health 3ainterleukin-8 3amacrophages 3amutants 3atranscription factors 3aveterinary medicine 3avirulence1 aWang, Yao1 aZhu, Hong1 aYi, Zhengfei1 aAfayibo, Dossêh Jean Apôtre1 aTao, Chenglin1 aLi, Tao1 aTian, Mingxing1 aQi, Jingjing1 aDing, Chan1 aYu, Shengqing1 aWang, Shaohui1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0170-33090 tBMC veterinary research.g2021 Dec., v. 52, no. 1 p.101-101dBioMed CentralwJournal:jnl4152735x1297-97167nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13567-021-00970-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01963naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100006600147245009100213520070700304592002801011650001601039650001801055650001201073650000901085650002101094651001001115653001901125653001801144653002501162653001601187653001001203653003101213700002001244700002001264700006601284700002301350773010101373856008201474852000901556655001201565IND60730179420221120164427.0220207e202106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073017942DNAL7 a10.1016/j.gfs.2021.1005062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCunningham, Solveig A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2354-152610aFood subsidies, nutrition transition, and dietary patterns in a remote Indian district  aWe examined food subsidies and dietary intake in a remote district of India in the context of globalizing food environments.

However, there were no differences between poor and non-poor in frequency of intake of rice and pulses, both of which are provided through the subsidies to the poor.  aPublisher supplied data 3afood intake 3afood security 3apoverty 3arice 3arural population 3aIndia 0aFood subsidies 0aWeekly intake 0aNutrition transition 0aDisparities 0aIndia 0aPublic Distribution System1 aShaikh, Nida I.1 aDatar, Ashlesha1 aChernishkin, Amanda E.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4378-90081 aPatil, Shailaja S.0 tGlobal food security.g2021 June, v. 29 p.100506-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:21608x2211-91247nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gfs.2021.1005063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02223naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245009200168300001600260520105300276592002801329650002501357650001101382650002001393650002201413650002101435650002201456650001501478651001001493653002101503653002101524653002501545653003101570700001301601700001501614773011301629856008601742852000901828655001201837IND60612459320221120152523.0201125e20181120xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061245932DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2018.07.2652doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Xiang10aElectric vehicle adoption in license plate-controlled big cities: Evidence from Beijing  ap. 191-196.  aFrom 2015 to 2017, under the same nationally available subsidy, license plate-controlled big cities accounted for 49.3%–65.0% of electric vehicle (EV) adoption in China. This phenomenon cannot be solely explained by subsidy policy. In this paper, we assess the influences of license plate lottery and subsidy policies, together with other influential factors, on consumers' intention to purchase EVs. Based on a large sample of data collected in Beijing, we find that license plate lottery and subsidy policies are both among the most influential factors in promoting EVs in Beijing. In a certain sense, license plate lottery policy had a stronger influence than subsidy policy at the time of the study. Other significant influential factors include the consumer's annual household income, level of interest in EV news, vehicle performance, daily travel distance, and number of family cars (negative). The study presents possible implications for policy-makers and companies and discusses warnings about implementing license plate lottery policy.  aPublisher supplied data 3abusiness enterprises 3acities 3adata collection 3aelectric vehicles 3ahousehold income 3aissues and policy 3apurchasing 3aChina 0aElectric vehicle 0aIncentive policy 0aVehicle quota policy 0aSustainable transportation1 aBai, Xue1 aZhong, Hua0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2018 Nov. 20, v. 202 p.191-196dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2018.07.2653Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02236naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002300145245012700168300001400295520107000309592002801379650001301407650001001420650001001430650001301440650002001453650001401473650001401487650002301501650001201524650002201536650001101558700002101569700002201590700002201612773012601634856008101760852000901841655001201850IND4469497220221118213330.0141112e201206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446949722DNAL7 a10.1016/j.lwt.2011.12.0312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGoldner, María C.10aComparative study of sensory and instrumental characteristics of texture and color of boiled under-exploited Andean tubers  ap. 83-90.  aAndean tubers are traditional staple food with different sizes, forms, colors and textures which, nowadays, are under-exploited. The work’s aims were 1) to determine the instrumental and sensory characteristics of texture and color of boiled Andean tubers; and 2) to establish the relationship between the perceived sensations and the instrumental analysis. Six tuber crops were evaluated by a trained panel and instrumental methods. Oca amarilla, Oca morada, and Papalisa were characterized by their colors. Imilla, Runa and Cuarentona were noted for their texture properties. Roughness, friability, adhesiveness and springiness could be predicted by instrumental firmness (r between 0.50 and 0.73). The dry matter, ranging from 10.4 to 30.4%, was associated with all the sensory texture descriptors according, but only showed Pearson’s correlation with manual adhesiveness (r = 0.62, P < 0.05) and firmness (r = 0.53, P < 0.05). This research determined some of the Andean tubers characteristics to start an appropriate utilization in food technology.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadhesion 3acolor 3acrops 3afirmness 3afood technology 3aroughness 3asensation 3asensory properties 3atexture 3atraditional foods 3atubers1 aPérez, Oscar E.1 aPilosof, Ana M.R.1 aArmada, Margarita0 tLebensmittel-Wissenschaft + Technologie.g2012 June, v. 47, no. 1 p.83-90dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl1644x0023-64387nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lwt.2011.12.0313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03938naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001800155245015800173520209400331592002802425650002802453650001902481650001302500650001402513650001202527650003102539650001002570650002002580650002202600650001802622650001202640650001202652650002102664650004302685650005202728650002402780650001202804650002902816650003602845650003202881650003202913650001302945653002202958653002302980653002003003653001603023653002203039700001803061700001803079700001703097700001903114700001703133773009903150856009003249852000903339655001203348IND60701885120221122165418.0210909e20201215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070188512DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aquaculture.2020.7357122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Wen-Fei10aGrass carp (Ctenopharyngodon idella) TAK1 promotes NF-κB activation via interaction with TAB1 in response to potential vaccine antigen of Vibrio mimicus  aIn mammals, transforming growth factor β-activated kinase 1 (TAK1) and TAK1-binding protein 1 (TAB1) are known as two crucial upstream mediators in the NF-κB signaling pathway. TAK1 interacts with TAB1 to form the TAK1–TAB1 complex, which triggers NF-κB activation through a series of cascade reactions. However, the interaction of TAK1 and TAB1 in grass carp (Ctenopharyngodon idella) and the effects of their interaction on the NF-κB activation remain largely unknown. Here, the transcriptional expression of the CiTAK1 and CiTAB1 genes was firstly detected by RT-qPCR, and both genes showed ubiquitous transcriptional expression in all the examined tissues of healthy grass carp. And the expression levels of both genes were significantly up-regulated in the different tissues of grass carp and C. idella kidney (CIK) cells after stimulation with the potential vaccine antigen of Vibrio mimicus (named OVepis), implying that both proteins are involved in the OVepis-induced immune response. Subsequently, an analysis of the subcellular localization showed that CiTAK1 was a cytoplasmic protein, whereas CiTAB1 was distributed throughout the HEK293T and CIK cells. Co-immunoprecipitation and pull-down assays proved that CiTAK1 could directly interact with CiTAB1 in vitro, which was further confirmed by co-localization assay, where these two proteins co-located in the cytoplasm. Finally, the effects of CiTAK1 and CiTAB1 co-overexpression on the NF-κB activation and transcriptional expression of downstream pro-inflammatory cytokines were investigated. The results showed that the CiNF-κB promoter activity and transcriptional expression levels of IL-1β, IL-8 and TNF-α enhanced significantly in the CiTAK1 and CiTAB1 co-overexpressed cells compared with non-overexpression control or overexpression of CiTAK1 or CiTAB1 alone, especially under rOVepis stimulation. Taken together, the data generated in this study indicate that the direct interaction between CiTAK1 and CiTAB1 might induce CiNF-κB signaling pathway activation in response to vaccine antigen of V. mimicus.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCtenopharyngodon idella 3aVibrio mimicus 3aantigens 3acytoplasm 3aenzymes 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3aimmune response 3ainterleukin-1beta 3ainterleukin-8 3akidneys 3amammals 3aprecipitin tests 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3asignal transduction 3atissues 3atranscription (genetics) 3atranscription factor NF-kappa B 3atransforming growth factors 3atumor necrosis factor-alpha 3avaccines 0aCiTAK1 and CiTAB1 0aExpression pattern 0aCo-localization 0aInteraction 0aNF-κB activation1 aCao, Shou-Lin1 aLiu, Xin-Yuan1 aZhu, Xin-Chi1 aZhou, Xiu-Hong1 aLi, Jin-Nian0 tAquaculture.g2020 Dec. 15, v. 529 p.735712-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl59663x0044-84867nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquaculture.2020.7357123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02915naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001500147245010900162300001800271520153000289592002801819650001901847650001701866650001801883650001301901650001301914650001901927650002701946650003101973650002202004650001502026650002202041650002102063650002002084653002102104653001802125653002802143653001202171700001502183700001402198700001502212700001902227773010802246856008202354852000902436655001202445IND60696613720221117014112.0211015e202006  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069661372DNAL7 a10.1016/j.psj.2019.12.0672doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhou, Shuo10aTranscriptome profiling analysis of underlying regulation of growing follicle development in the chicken  ap. 2861-2872.  aLarge ovarian follicles are primary characteristics of oviparous species. The development of such follicles is crucially governed by strict intrinsic complex regulation. Many aspects of the genetic basis of this regulation remain obscure. To identify the dominant genes controlling follicular development in the chicken, growing follicles (400–1,600 μm in diameter) were selected for RNA sequencing and bioinformatics analysis. Comparing the 400-μm follicles with 800-μm follicles identified a total of 3,627 differentially expressed genes (1,792 upregulated and 1,835 downregulated genes). Comparing the 400-μm follicles with 1,600-μm follicles revealed 9,650 differentially expressed genes (including 4,848 upregulated and 4,802 downregulated genes). Comparing 800-μm with 1,600-μm follicles revealed a total of 6,779 differentially expressed genes (3,427 upregulated and 3,352 downregulated genes). Transcriptome analysis revealed that genes related to the extracellular matrix–receptor interactions, steroid biosynthesis, cell adhesion, and phagosomes displayed remarkable differential expressions. Relative to 400-μm follicles, collagen content, production of steroid hormones, cell adhesion, and phagocytic factors were significantly increased in the 1,600-μm follicles. This study identifies the dominant genes involved in the promotion of follicular development in oviparous vertebrates and represents the extraordinary gene regulation pattern related to development of the growing follicles in poultry.  aPublisher supplied data 3abioinformatics 3abiosynthesis 3acell adhesion 3achickens 3acollagen 3adominant genes 3afollicular development 3agene expression regulation 3aovarian follicles 3aphagosomes 3asequence analysis 3asteroid hormones 3atranscriptomics 0agrowing follicle 0atranscriptome 0abioinformatics analysis 0achicken1 aMa, Yanfen1 aZhao, Dan1 aMi, Yuling1 aZhang, Caiqiao0 tPoultry science.g2020 June, v. 99, no. 6 p.2861-2872dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl45501x0032-57917nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.psj.2019.12.0673Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03238naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001900144245011300163300001800276500001900294520161000313592002801923650002201951650001401973650001201987650001101999650001902010650001302029650003002042650003402072650002102106650002202127650001402149650001302163650001702176650000902193653002502202653000702227653004102234653002102275700001602296700001902312700001702331700001302348700001302361700001802374700002102392700005702413773013902470856007802609852000902687655001202696IND60725579620221118093532.0210127e20210118xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072557962DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.0c134402doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHao, Xiaoqiong10aBiomass-Derived N-Doped Carbon for Efficient Electrocatalytic CO₂ Reduction to CO and Zn–CO₂ Batteries  ap. 3738-3747.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aConversion of CO₂ into valuable chemicals via electrochemical CO₂ reduction reaction (CO₂RR) is a promising technology to alleviate the energy crisis and the greenhouse effect. Herein, low-cost wood biomass was applied as the carbon source to prepare nitrogen (N)-doped carbon electrocatalysts for the conversion of CO₂ to CO and further as the cathode material for Zn–CO₂ batteries. By virtue of N-doping and assistance of FeCl₃, a cedar biomass-derived three-dimensional (3D) N-doped graphitized carbon with a high N-doping content (5.38%), an ultrahigh specific surface area (1673.6 m² g–¹), rich nanopores, and sufficient active N sites was successfully obtained, which exhibited super CO₂RR activity with a high faradaic efficiency of 91% at a low applied potential of 0.56 V (vs RHE) and a long-term stability for at least 20 h. Furthermore, a Zn–CO₂ battery with it as the cathode material delivered a stable open circuit voltage of 0.79 V, a peak power density of 0.51 mW cm–² at 2.14 mA cm–², and a maximum faradaic efficiency to CO of 80.4% at 2.56 mA cm–², indicating that it could be applied in a practical process by using CO₂ to generate power with the production of CO. Density functional theory calculations revealed that pyridinic N could more effectively decrease the free energy barriers for CO₂RR and boost the reaction. This work not only revealed a facile approach to convert waste biomass into N-doped-graphitization carbon as valuable CO₂RR electrocatalysts but also provided a new strategy to achieve “carbon solving carbon’s problem”.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGibbs free energy 3abatteries 3abiomass 3acarbon 3acarbon dioxide 3acathodes 3adensity functional theory 3aelectric potential difference 3aelectrochemistry 3agreenhouse effect 3ananopores 3anitrogen 3asurface area 3awood 0aCO2 electroreduction 0aCO 0anitrogen-doped graphitization carbon 0aZn−CO2 battery1 aAn, Xiaowei1 aPatil, Amar M.1 aWang, Peifen1 aMa, Xuli1 aDu, Xiao1 aHao, Xiaogang1 aAbudula, Abuliti1 aGuan, Guoqing1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5875-35960 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2021 Jan. 18, v. 13, no. 3 p.3738-3747dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.0c134403Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03380naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245011700169520170000286592002801986650002102014650001202035650001602047650001502063650001602078650001002094650002102104650002102125650002402146650001102170650001102181650001802192650001202210650001302222650001402235650002002249650001502269650003602284650002402320650001402344650001102358653002102369653002202390653001002412653003602422653002202458700001902480700002502499700002102524700002202545700002202567773011902589856008502708852000902793655001202802IND60615797620221122140934.0210513e202003  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061579762DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbapap.2018.09.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWeissman, Ziva10aGenetic analysis of Hsp70 phosphorylation sites reveals a role in Candida albicans cell and colony morphogenesis  aHeat shock proteins are best known for their role as chaperonins involved in general proteostasis, but they can also participate in specific cellular regulatory pathways, e.g. via their post-translational modification. Hsp70/Ssa1 is a central cytoplasmic chaperonin in eukaryotes, which also participates in cell cycle regulation via its phosphorylation at a specific residue. Here we analyze the role of Ssa1 phosphorylation in the morphogenesis of the fungus Candida albicans, a common human opportunistic pathogen. C. albicans can assume alternative yeast and hyphal (mold) morphologies, an ability that contributes to its virulence. We identified 11 phosphorylation sites on C. albicans Ssa1, of which 8 were only detected in the hyphal cells. Genetic analysis of these sites revealed allele-specific effects on growth or hyphae formation at 42 °C. Colony morphology, which is normally wrinkled or crenellated at 37 °C, reverted to smooth in several mutants, but this colony morphology phenotype was unrelated to cellular morphology. Two mutants exhibited a mild increase in sensitivity to the cell wall-active compounds caspofungin and calcofluor white. We suggest that this analysis could help direct screens for Ssa1-specific drugs to combat C. albicans virulence. The pleiotropic effects of many Ssa1 mutations are consistent with the large number of Ssa1 client proteins, whereas the lack of concordance between the phenotypes of the different alleles suggests that different sites on Ssa1 can affect interaction with specific classes of client proteins, and that modification of these sites can play cellular regulatory roles, consistent with the “chaperone code” hypothesis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCandida albicans 3aalleles 3acaspofungin 3acell cycle 3achaperonins 3adrugs 3aeukaryotic cells 3agenetic analysis 3aheat shock proteins 3ahumans 3ahyphae 3amorphogenesis 3amutants 3amutation 3aphenotype 3aphosphorylation 3apleiotropy 3apost-translational modification 3asecondary infection 3avirulence 3ayeasts 0aCandida albicans 0aColony morphology 0aHsp70 0aPost-translational modification 0aMass spectrometry1 aPinsky, Mariel1 aWolfgeher, Donald J.1 aKron, Stephen J.1 aTruman, Andrew W.1 aKornitzer, Daniel0 tBiochimica et biophysica acta.g2020 Mar., v. 1868, no. 3 p.140135-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12097x1570-96397nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbapap.2018.09.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03104naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001900144245014800163300001800311500001900329520153700348592002801885650002101913650000901934650001801943650001701961650001101978650001001989650001901999650000902018650001302027650001902040653002102059653002002080653003702100653001202137653003202149700001602181700001402197700001602211700006002227700005502287700005402342773013902396856007802535852000902613655001202622IND60725579720221118093531.0210127e20210113xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072557972DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.0c138152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Junhong10aSandwich-Type Near-Infrared Conjugated Polymer Nanoparticles for Revealing the Fate of Transplanted Human Umbilical Cord Mesenchymal Stem Cells  ap. 3512-3520.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aNear-infrared conjugated polymer nanoparticles (NIR-CPNs) have been widely used in in vivo imaging fields. However, most of them face the aggregation-induced fluorescence quenching (ACQ) dilemma and serious dye leakage behavior, which impedes the long-term monitoring of transplanted cells in vivo. In the present work, a novel strategy of sandwich-type encapsulation of the conjugated polymer interlayer in the crystalline SiO₂ core + shell (SSiO₂@SPFTBT@CSiO₂) is developed, which works well to avoid the ACQ problem by homogeneously dispersing poly((9,9-dioctylfluorene-2,7-diyl)-alt-(4,7-di(thiophene-2-yl)-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole)-5′,5″-diyl) (PFTBT) and suppressing intermolecular π–π stacking. Furthermore, the unparalleled nanostructure efficiently stabilizes nanoparticles and successfully achieves long-term biocompatibility without interfering the biological characteristics of stem cells, indicating the potential of SSiO₂@SPFTBT@CSiO₂ in cell labeling. In addition, the fate of human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells (hucMSCs) in a mouse model with acute liver injury was disclosed. We found that the hucMSCs mainly migrated from the lungs to the injured liver and most transplanted hucMSCs were cleared up by the liver at 8 days post-injection. Revelation of the shuttle process and period will benefit in improving the clinical efficacy of hucMSCs, and the sandwich-type encapsulation strategy could also open a new avenue to obtain bright and robust NIR-CPNs for long-term fluorescence imaging.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiocompatibility 3adyes 3aencapsulation 3afluorescence 3ahumans 3aliver 3aliver diseases 3amice 3apolymers 3aumbilical cord 0aNIR fluorescence 0ain vivo imaging 0aconjugated polymer nanoparticles 0ahucMSCs 0asandwich-type encapsulation1 aMohsin, Ali1 aPeng, Yan1 aDai, Yichen1 aZhuang, Yingping1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6772-73061 aGuo, Meijin1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3171-48021 aZhao, Peng1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2380-28690 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2021 Jan. 13, v. 13, no. 3 p.3512-3520dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.0c138153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03479naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100003400145245012500179300001600304520216700320592002802487650002302515650001702538650002402555650001502579650002902594650001402623650001402637650002302651650001602674650001102690650001402701650001602715651001402731700002102745700001802766700002202784700001702806700002002823700001602843773011902859856004602978852000903024655001203033IND50089730820221120105002.0140517e201406  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5008973082DNAL7 a10.1111/1365-2664.122382doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBlanchard, J.

For example, in Europe, targets for (i) biodiversity, (ii) food web structure as indicated by the proportion of large fish and (iii) fishing mortality rates for exploited species that lead to maximum sustainable yield, FMSY, are being proposed to support implementation of the Marine Strategy Framework Directive. Efforts to reconcile any trade‐offs among objectives need to be informed by knowledge on the consequences of alternate management actions. We develop, calibrate and apply a multispecies size spectrum model of the North Sea fish community to assess the response of populations and the community to fishing. The model predicts species' size distributions, abundance, productivity and interactions and therefore provides a single framework for evaluating trade‐offs between population status, community and food web structure, biodiversity and fisheries yield. We show that the model can replicate realistic fish population and community structure and past responses to fishing. We assess whether meeting management targets for exploited North Sea populations (fishing species at FMSY) will be sufficient to meet proposed targets for biodiversity and food web indicators under two management scenarios (status quo and FMSY). The recovery in biodiversity indicators is 60% greater when fishing populations at FMSY than if status quo (2010) fishing rates are maintained. The probability of achieving a food web target was 60% under both scenarios in spite of major community restructuring revealed by other indicators of community size structure. Synthesis and applications. Our model can be applied to evaluate indicator targets and trade‐offs among fisheries and conservation objectives. There is a significant probability that reductions in fishing mortality below FMSY would be needed in Europe if managers make a binding commitment to a proposed large fish indicator target, with concomitant reductions in fisheries yield.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal communities 3abiodiversity 3acommunity structure 3aecosystems 3aenvironmental management 3afisheries 3afood webs 3amarine environment 3amarine fish 3amodels 3amortality 3aprobability 3aNorth Sea1 aAndersen, Ken H.1 aScott, Finlay1 aHintzen, Niels T.1 aPiet, Gerjan1 aJennings, Simon1 aPunt, Andre0 tJournal of applied ecology.g2014 June, v. 51, no. 3 p.612-622dBlackwell Scientific Publicationsx0021-89017nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1365-2664.12238  aDNAL 7aarticle01353naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245004600171300001600217520036200233592002800595650001400623650003100637653000800668653000800676653000800684653000800692653002000700653001200720653002600732653002300758700002200781773010600803856008500909852000900994655001201003IND60599782920221121044138.0180702e201309  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059978292DNAL7 a10.1016/j.econlet.2013.05.0162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRiener, Gerhard10aHeterogeneous treatment effects in groups  ap. 408-412.  aWe show in a laboratory experiment that the same method of group induction carries different behavioral consequences.

As a result, there is great interest in studying the changes over time in the probability and magnitude of heat waves. In this paper we propose a hierarchical Bayesian model for serially-dependent extreme temperatures. We assume the marginal temperature distribution follows the generalized Pareto distribution (GPD) above a location-specific threshold, and capture dependence between subsequent days using a transformed max-stable process. Our model allows both the parameters in the marginal GPD and the temporal dependence function to change over time. This allows Bayesian inference on the change in likelihood of a heat wave. We apply this methodology to daily high temperatures in nine cities in the western US for 1979–2010. Our analysis reveals increases in the probability of a heat wave in several US cities.

Extraction from cultivation or processing waste streams using a solvent‐free approach could lessen to permit commercial applications in food processing and preservation. RESULTS: Phenolics were extracted from mangosteen bark, leaf and fruit pericarp in methanol and in water using response surface methodology to optimize recovery. Initial examination of antimicrobial effects revealed a lack of antimicrobial activity against fungi and weak activity against the Gram‐negative bacteria Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium. In contrast, extracts prepared from bark or fruit pericarp exhibited strong pH‐dependent bacteriostatic and bactericidal effects against Listeria monocytogenes and Staphylococcus aureus. Activity was slightly weaker in aqueous extracts due to lower concentrations of tartaric acid esters and flavonols than in methanolic extracts. Measurement of propidium iodide uptake and ATP leakage indicated that the extracts induced damage to the membrane of Gram‐positive bacteria. CONCLUSION: Extracts of mangosteen bark and fruit pericarp contain mixtures of phenolic compounds with activity against Gram‐positive bacteria, notably Listeria monocytogenes. Extraction of phenolics from mangosteen waste could yield fractions for potential applications in the formulation of low‐cost processing aids or sanitizers for the food industry. © 2013 Her Majesty the Queen in Right of Canada, as represented by the Minister of Agriculture and Agri‐Food Canada, Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture © 2013 Society of Chemical Industry  aPublisher supplied data 3aStaphylococcus aureus 3apericarp 3aSalmonella Typhimurium 3afungi 3atartaric acid 3aesters 3aListeria monocytogenes 3aleaves 3aEscherichia coli 3aadenosine triphosphate 3aresponse surface methodology 3aproduction costs 3aprocessing waste 3aantibacterial properties 3asanitizers 3amethanol 3aGarcinia mangostana 3afood industry 3afood processing 3aanti-infective agents 3abark 3abacteria 3aphenolic compounds 2aAgriculture 2aAnti-Bacterial Agentsxpharmacology 2aCell Membranexdrug effects 2aFlavonolsxpharmacology 2aFood Handling 2aFruit 2aGarcinia mangostanaxchemistry 2aGram-Negative Bacteriaxdrug effects 2aListeria monocytogenesxdrug effects 2aMicrobial Sensitivity Tests 2aPhenolsxpharmacology 2aPlant Bark 2aPlant Extractsxpharmacology 2aStaphylococcus aureusxdrug effects 2aTartratesxpharmacology 3aCanada 0aSalmonella typhimurium 0aantimicrobial agents1 aSophanodora, Pairat1 aToivonen, Peter1 aDelaquis, Pascal0 tJournal of the science of food and agriculture.g2013 Dec., v. 93, no. 15 p.3792-3800dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltdx0022-51427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jsfa.6277  aDNAL 7aarticle03643naa a2200925 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245009000168520148600258592002801744650001501772650002201787650001901809650002201828650001901850650001901869650001501888650001301903650001901916653000801935653000801943653000701951653001601958653000701974653001201981653000901993653000802002653000802010653000802018653000802026653000902034653000802043653000902051653000802060653000802068653000802076653000802084653000702092653000802099653000802107653000702115653000802122653000802130653000802138653000902146653000802155653001002163653001002173653000802183653000702191653000702198653000802205653000902213653000802222653000802230653000802238653000802246653000802254653000802262653000702270653000702277653000902284653002102293653002102314653001802335653003302353653002202386700002002408700002102428700002102449700002602470773011402496856008602610852000902696655001202705IND60702618120221121042828.0211106e20210115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070261812DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhazmat.2020.1234612doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPang, Xinzhu10aRemoval of phthalates from aqueous solution by semiconductor photocatalysis: A review  aWhile phthalate esters are commonly used as plasticizers to improve the flexibility and workability of polymeric materials, their presence and detection in various environments has become a significant concern. Phthalate esters are known to have endocrine-disrupting effects, which affects reproductive health and physical development. As a result, there is now increased focus and urgency to develop effective and energy efficient technologies capable of removing these harmful compounds from the environment. This review explores the use of semiconductor photocatalysis as an efficient and promising solution towards achieving removal and degradation of phthalate esters. A comprehensive review of photocatalysts reported in the literature demonstrates the range of materials including commercial TiO₂, solar activated catalysts and composite materials capable of enhancing adsorption and degradation. The degradation pathways and kinetics are also considered to provide the reader with an insight into the photocatalytic mechanism of removal. In addition, through the use of two key platforms (the technology readiness level scale and electrical energy per order), the crucial parameters associated with advancing photocatalysis for phthalate ester removal are discussed. These include enhanced surface interaction, catalyst platform development, improved light delivery systems and overall system energy requirements with a view towards pilot scale and industrial deployment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3aaqueous solutions 3aelectric power 3aenergy efficiency 3aphotocatalysis 3aphotocatalysts 3aphthalates 3apolymers 3asemiconductors 0aAOP 0aBBP 0aCA 0aCA-α-Fe2O3 0aCB 0aCB-TiO2 0aCMCD 0aCNT 0aCPI 0aDAP 0aDBP 0aDEHP 0aDEP 0aDiBP 0aDMP 0aDOP 0aEbg 0aEEO 0aEU 0aHAT 0aHGM 0aIQ 0aLDH 0aLED 0aL-H 0aMEHP 0aMMP 0amPMMA 0aMWCNT 0aNHE 0aNT 0aPA 0aPAE 0aPANi 0aPET 0aRAF 0aROS 0aSET 0aTOC 0aTRL 0aUV 0aVB 0aWWTP 0aPhthalate esters 0aPhotodegradation 0aPhotocatalyst 0aAdvanced oxidation processes 0aPollutant removal1 aSkillen, Nathan1 aGunaratne, Nimal1 aRooney, David W.1 aRobertson, Peter K.J.0 tJournal of hazardous materials.g2021 Jan. 15, v. 402 p.123461-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6200x0304-38947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2020.1234613Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03488naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002900147245012800176300001600304520170300320592002802023650003302051650001502084650003202099650001302131650001702144650001802161650001602179650001802195650001802213650001202231650004802243650001402291650002002305650002202325650000902347650001402356650002502370653002302395653002002418653001402438653001702452653000902469653001302478653000902491700002202500700002602522700002502548700001902573700002302592700001802615700002102633700002402654700002302678773008302701856008102784852000902865655001202874IND60556540420221117164051.0170719e20161115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055654042DNAL7 a10.1016/j.lfs.2016.09.0232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRocha-Rodrigues, Sílvia10aEffects of physical exercise on myokines expression and brown adipose-like phenotype modulation in rats fed a high-fat diet  ap. 100-108.  aExercise-stimulated myokine secretion into circulation may be related with browning in white adipose tissue (WAT), representing a positive metabolic effect on whole-body fat mass. However, limited information is yet available regarding the impact of exercise on myokine-related modulation of adipocyte phenotype in WAT from obese rats.Sprague-Dawley rats (n=60) were divided into sedentary and voluntary physical activity (VPA) groups and fed with standard (35kcal% fat) or high-fat (HFD, 71kcal% fat)-isoenergetic diets. The VPA-groups had unrestricted access to wheel running throughout the protocol. After-9weeks, half of sedentary standard (SS) and sedentary HFD (HS)-fed animals were exercised on treadmill (endurance training, ET) for 8-weeks while maintaining the dietary treatments.The adipocyte hypertrophy induced by HFD were attenuated by VPA and ET. HFD decreased 5′ AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activity in muscle as well as peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator-1α (PGC-1α) and uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) proteins in eWAT, while not affecting circulating irisin. VPA increased eWAT Tmem26 mRNA levels in the standard diet-fed group, whereas ET increased AMPK, interleukin 6 (IL-6) and fibronectin type III domain-containing protein 5 (FNDC5) protein expression in muscle, but had no impact on circulating irisin protein content. In eWAT, ET increased bone morphogenetic protein 7 (Bmp7), Cidea and PGC-1α in both diet-fed animals, whereas BMP7, Prdm16, UCP1 and FNDC5 only in standard diet-fed group.Data suggest that ET-induced myokine production seems to contribute, at least in part, to the “brown-like” phenotype in WAT from rats fed a HFD.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAMP-activated protein kinase 3aadipocytes 3abone morphogenetic proteins 3aexercise 3afibronectins 3ahigh fat diet 3ahypertrophy 3ainterleukin-6 3amessenger RNA 3amuscles 3aperoxisome proliferator-activated receptors 3aphenotype 3aprotein content 3aprotein synthesis 3arats 3asecretion 3awhite adipose tissue 0aEndurance training 0aSkeletal muscle 0aAdiposity 0aFNDC5/irisin 0aIL-6 0aBrowning 0aUCP11 aRodríguez, Amaia1 aGouveia, Alexandra M.1 aGonçalves, Inês O.1 aBecerril, Sara1 aRamírez, Beatriz,1 aBeleza, Jorge1 aFrühbeck, Gema,1 aAscensão, António1 aMagalhães, José,0 tLife sciences.g2016 Nov. 15, v. 165 p.100-108dElsevier Inc.x0024-32057nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lfs.2016.09.0233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02306naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245005900171300001600230520104900246592002801295650002301323650002001346650002501366650002401391650001401415650002501429650001601454653000801470653000801478653000801486653000801494653000801502653000801510653001901518653001601537653002601553653001601579653001801595653000901613700002601622773010601648856008501754852000901839655001201848IND60599783220221121044252.0180702e201309  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059978322DNAL7 a10.1016/j.econlet.2013.05.0192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCrost, Benjamin10aOptimal climate policy: Uncertainty versus Monte Carlo  ap. 552-558.  aThe integrated assessment literature frequently replicates uncertainty by averaging Monte Carlo runs of deterministic models. This Monte Carlo analysis is, in essence, an averaged sensitivity analyses. The approach resolves all uncertainty before the first time period, drawing parameters from a distribution before initiating a given model run. This paper analyzes how closely a Monte Carlo based derivation of optimal policies is to the truly optimal policy, in which the decision maker acknowledges the full set of possible future trajectories in every period. Our analysis uses a stochastic dynamic programming version of the widespread integrated assessment model DICE, and focuses on damage uncertainty. We show that the optimizing Monte Carlo approach is not only off in magnitude, but can even lead to a wrong sign of the uncertainty effect. Moreover, it can lead to contradictory policy advice, suggesting a more stringent climate policy in terms of the abatement rate and a less stringent one in terms of the expenditure on abatement.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMonte Carlo method 3adecision making 3adeterministic models 3adynamic programming 3aeconomics 3aenvironmental policy 3auncertainty 0aQ54 0aQ00 0aD61 0aD90 0aC61 0aC63 0aClimate change 0aUncertainty 0aIntegrated assessment 0aMonte Carlo 0aRisk aversion 0aDICE1 aTraeger, Christian P.0 tEconomics letters.g2013 Sept., v. 120, no. 3 p.552-558dElsevier B.V.wJournal:3059x0165-17657nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.econlet.2013.05.0193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02558naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100001400138245013800152520151900290592002801809650002001837650001801857650002501875650002201900651001001922700001701932700001501949700001801964700002901982700002202011773011802033856007202151852000902223655001202232IND60653239320221122064723.0190714e20170815xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065323932DNAL7 a10.3390/w90806032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXie, Qike10aUnderstanding the Temperature Variations and Thermal Structure of a Subtropical Deep River-Run Reservoir before and after Impoundment  aA two-dimensional hydrodynamic CE-QUAL-W2 model was configured for a deep subtropical river-run reservoir, the Xiluodu Reservoir (XLDR), in China to simulate water temperature in the first two years of impoundment (2013–2014) using measured data as model input. It was calibrated using observed temperature profiles near the dam and the outflow temperatures. Observed daily temperatures at four gauging stations upstream or downstream of XLDR before (2000–2012) and after the impoundment (4 May 2013) were analyzed and fitted with a sine function representing seasonal temperature variation. The fitted annual temperature phase shifts showed no phase delay in XLDR area before the impoundment but revealed a phase delay about 17 days between outflow and inflow after the impoundment, which was not caused by the air temperature variation. The simulated temperatures verified a similar phase delay after the impoundment. The simulated temperatures, water ages, and vertical temperature gradients demonstrated an average metalimnetic deepening rate of 0.49 m/day (average inflow ~4500 m3/s) while the largest rate due to massive inflow (~15,000 m3/s) was 1.67 m/day. The W2 model was run under hypothetic scenarios of different inflow/outflow rates and outflow withdrawn elevations. The results revealed that greater inflow/outflow rate could lead to higher metalimnetic deepening rate and smaller outflow phase delay, while deeper outflow withdrawn could lead to deeper metalimnion and larger epilimnetic depth.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair temperature 3ahydrodynamics 3atemperature profiles 3awater temperature 3aChina1 aLiu, Zhaowei1 aFang, Xing1 aChen, Yongcan1 aLi, Chong,d1955 May 16-1 aMacintyre, Sally,0 tWater.g2017 Aug. 15, v. 9, no. 8dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21688x2073-44417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w90806033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02991naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001300147245013400160300001400294520149500308592002801803650001601831650001401847650002501861650001701886650001001903650001901913650001601932650002001948650001601968650001501984650003301999650002402032650001602056650001702072650001602089650002202105650000902127650000902136653001302145653000902158653001702167653001702184653001702201700001202218700001502230700001802245700001502263773008102278856008102359852000902440655001202449IND60556540520221117164004.0161102e20161201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055654052DNAL7 a10.1016/j.lfs.2016.09.0242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Hao10aCoadministration of puerarin (low dose) and zinc attenuates bone loss and suppresses bone marrow adiposity in ovariectomized rats  ap. 20-26.  aPuerarin is a phytoestrogen that shows osteogenic effects. Meanwhile, zinc stimulates bone formation and inhibits bone resorption. The study aims to investigate the effects of coadministration of puerarin (low dose) and zinc on bone formation in ovariectomized rats.Co-administration or use alone of puerarin (low dose) and/or zinc were gavaged in OVX rats. The estrogen-like effects were detected by the uterus weight, the histologic observation and the IGF-1 protein expression. The osteogenic effects were determined by bone histomorphometric and mechanical parameters, osteogenic and adipogenic blood markers, and so on.The results showed that oral administration of puerarin (low dose) plus zinc didn't significantly increase uterus weight. The glandular epithelial of endometrium had no proliferation and no protein expression of IGF-1. Moreover, co-administration attenuated bone loss and biomechanical decrease more than single use of puerarin or zinc (p<0.05). Next, combined administration of puerarin and zinc promoted the serological level of osteocalcin, bone marrow stromal cell (BMSC) proliferation, and the expression of alkaline phosphatase (ALP), and suppressed the serological level of adiponectin and adiposity in bone marrow (BM).In conclusion, co-administrated puerarin (low dose) and zinc can partially reverse OVX-induced bone loss and suppress the adiposity of BM in rats, which shed light on the potential use of puerarin and zinc in the treatment of osteoporosis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadiponectin 3aadiposity 3aalkaline phosphatase 3abiomechanics 3ablood 3abone formation 3abone marrow 3abone resorption 3aendometrium 3aepithelium 3ainsulin-like growth factor I 3aoral administration 3aosteocalcin 3aosteoporosis 3aovariectomy 3aprotein synthesis 3arats 3azinc 0aPuerarin 0aZinc 0aOsteoporosis 0aOsteogenesis 0aAdipogenesis1 aLi, Wei1 aGe, Xiyuan1 aJia, Shengnan1 aLi, Binbin0 tLife sciences.g2016 Dec. 01, v. 166 p.20-26dElsevier Inc.x0024-32057nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lfs.2016.09.0243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02804naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100006100150245010500211300001600316520134800332592002801680650001901708650002101727650001101748650002601759650001401785650001401799650001101813650001301824650002101837650001201858650001901870650001101889650002201900650001801922650001001940653001901950653001801969653001901987653002502006653002202031700001902053700002202072700002002094773010202114856008502216852000902301655001202310IND60615798020221122140837.0191011e201811  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061579802DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecoinf.2018.09.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKaitaniemi, Pekka1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5162-242X10aComputational analysis of the effects of light gradients and neighbouring species on foliar nitrogen  ap. 171-177.  aFoliar nitrogen is one of the key traits determining the photosynthetic capacity of trees. It is influenced by many environmental factors that are often confounded with the photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD), which alone strongly modifies the nitrogen content and other foliar traits. We combined field measurements and computational estimates of light transmittance in 3D stands with different combinations of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) and silver birch (Betula pendula) to decouple the effect of PPFD from other potential effects exerted by the species of neighbouring trees on the leaf nitrogen content per unit leaf area (Narea) and leaf mass per area (LMA). Independent of the level of PPFD, silver birch had a significantly lower Narea and LMA when Scots pine was abundant in its neighbourhood compared with the presence of conspecific neighbours. In Scots pine, Narea and LMA were only dependent on PPFD and the branching order of shoots. In both species, the relationships between PPFD and Narea or LMA were nonlinear, especially at intermediate levels of PPFD. The levels of PPFD did not show any dependence on the species of the neighbouring trees. The responses of silver birch suggest that the species composition of the surrounding stand can influence foliar nitrogen, independent of the level of PPFD within the canopy.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBetula pendula 3aPinus sylvestris 3acanopy 3aenvironmental factors 3aleaf area 3aleaf mass 3aleaves 3anitrogen 3anitrogen content 3aphotons 3aphotosynthesis 3ashoots 3aspecies diversity 3atransmittance 3atrees 0a3D stand model 0aLeaf nitrogen 0aLight gradient 0aSpecies interactions 0aStand composition1 aLintunen, Anna1 aSievänen, Risto,1 aPerttunen, Jari0 tEcological informatics.g2018 Nov., v. 48 p.171-177dElsevier B.V.wJournal:2190x1574-95417nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoinf.2018.09.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02588naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245013200169520120600301592002801507650001501535650002501550650002101575650001701596650002801613650000901641650002201650650002501672650001501697650002501712650003101737653003201768653002301800653002501823653001701848653003001865700001701895700001801912700001501930773011401945856008602059852000902145655001202154IND60702618320221121042845.0211106e20210115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070261832DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhazmat.2020.1234632doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWi, Seunghwan10aEvaluation of environmental impact on the formaldehyde emission and flame-retardant performance of thermal insulation materials  aThermal insulation material, an essential building material, is used to preserve heat or block heat gains in buildings. Insulation material is currently attracting significant attention, and thermal conductivity, i.e., thermal insulation performance, is expressed at a very low value. Therefore, since the era of industrialization, several chemicals have been used to secure thermal insulation performance in each sector; therefore, the resulting hazards have increased. To date, researches have been mainly conducted to secure the low thermal conductivity of insulating material; however, the hazards remain unaddressed. Therefore, this study quantitatively evaluates 18 building construction products and the emission of pollutants and harmful gas during combustion events. Pollutant emission was conducted using the 20-L small chamber method according to the ISO 16000, and formaldehyde, total volatile organic compounds, and five volatile organic compounds were analyzed. Gas hazard evaluation during combustion was evaluated by KS F 2271: Fire Retardant Testing Method of Interior Finishes and Structures as the average behavioral stop time of rats under thermal insulation combustion conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3acombustion 3aenvironmental impact 3aflame retardants 3aformaldehyde 3ahazard characterization 3aheat 3aindustrialization 3ainsulating materials 3apollutants 3athermal conductivity 3avolatile organic compounds 0aThermal insulation material 0a20-L small chamber 0aEnvironmental impact 0aFormaldehyde 0aVolatile organic compound1 aPark, Ji Hun1 aKim, Young Uk1 aKim, Sumin0 tJournal of hazardous materials.g2021 Jan. 15, v. 402 p.123463-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6200x0304-38947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2020.1234633Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02906naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002500151245007200176300001400248520165200262592002801914650001601942650001201958650001301970650001801983650001802001650001102019650002002030650001302050650001502063650002002078650001602098653001602114653001202130653001302142653001302155653002302168653002802191700006002219773009802279856008602377852000902463655001202472IND60560399820221121151456.0190319e201705  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056039982DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodhyd.2016.12.0182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGoudoulas, Thomas B.10aPhase transition kinetics and rheology of gelatin-alginate mixtures  ap. 49-60.  aThe present study reports systematic rheological data of binary aqueous mixtures of gelatin and alginate up to a concentration ratio of 1:1. The mixtures were prepared and rheologically studied with respect to the gelation point, melting point, and kinetics. The effect of the polysaccharide concentration on the sol–gel and gel–sol transitions is presented for concentrations up to 5% (w/w). Under small amplitude oscillatory shearing conditions, both transitions were shifted to higher temperatures. The kinetic study showed that the storage modulus will continue to increase in time under isothermal conditions, even if the rate of increase is considerably reduced. Furthermore, all binary gels exhibited a higher storage modulus than the pure gelatin gels at 5 °C. The increase was 9 and 24% for 5 and 2.5% gelatin, respectively. Assuming that the storage modulus is directly related to the amount of the triple helixes, all isothermal data could be successfully described by the kinetic gelation model proposed by Djabourov, Leblond, & Papon (1988a, 1988b). The excellent agreement between the rheological data and the gelation model confirm that this model can effectively predict the long-term elastic properties of the binary mixtures. Using isolated prototype modules, discrete gel specimens were formulated at 5 °C. Large amplitude oscillatory shear measurements (LAOS) showed that these specimens were still intact after the tests. The gels that were prepared directly on the rheometer plate exhibited strain hardening behavior during LAOS deformations. A nonlinear stress analysis of the Lissajous plots confirmed this finding.  aPublisher supplied data 3adeformation 3agelatin 3agelation 3ahydrocolloids 3amelting point 3amodels 3apolysaccharides 3arheology 3arheometers 3astorage modulus 3atemperature 0aBinary gels 0aGelatin 0aAlginate 0aGelation 0aThermal hysteresis 0aViscoelastic properties1 aGermann, Natalie1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1538-13710 tFood hydrocolloids.g2017 May, v. 66 p.49-60dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46643x0268-005X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodhyd.2016.12.0183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02460naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100001600138245007400154520144200228592002801670650001201698650001401710650002301724650001501747650001401762650002001776650000901796650001201805650001401817650001501831650002001846650002001866651001301886773011801899856007202017852000902089655001202098IND60653239420221122064728.0190714e20170726xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065323942DNAL7 a10.3390/w90805592doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNovo, Paula10aAccounting for the Assimilative Capacity of Water Systems in Scotland  aA key methodological challenge in understanding the relationship between the economy and the underlying ecosystem base resides in how to account for the ecosystem’s degradation and the decline of associated ecosystem services. In this study, we use information on nutrients and metals concentrations from the Environmental Change Network (ECN) database and the Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA) for the period 2000–2010 in order to assess the assimilation capacity of water systems. The research covers five upstream sites and 17 downstream sites in northeast Scotland. Our results highlight the relevance of considering a number of pollutants, and suggest that elements such as arsenic, lead and mercury can pose a threat to ecosystems’ sustainability and health. However, little research has been done in terms of their assimilation capacity and their impact on grey water footprint assessments. In addition, the results indicate that background conditions might be relevant when performing sustainability analysis at different spatial scales. The study also poses relevant questions in relation to land management approaches versus traditional ‘end-of-pipe’ water treatment approaches, and the definition of maximum and background concentrations. In this regard, further studies will be required to understand the trade-offs between different ecosystem services depending on how these concentrations are defined.  aPublisher supplied data 3aarsenic 3adatabases 3aecosystem services 3aecosystems 3agreywater 3aland management 3alead 3amercury 3anutrients 3apollutants 3awater footprint 3awater treatment 3aScotland0 tWater.g2017 July 26, v. 9, no. 8dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21688x2073-44417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w90805593Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02951naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245011000168300001400278520156000292592002801852650002801880650003001908650001301938650002001951650001801971650001901989650001002008650001902018650001702037650001202054650001202066650001302078650004302091700002002134700001802154700001902172700001702191700002102208700002802229773012302257856008102380990002302461852000902484655001202493IND60094834120221122011931.0141104e201204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009483412DNAL7 a10.1016/j.dsx.2012.08.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKoldemir, Meliha10aRelationship of RIC-3 gene rs1528133 polymorphism with varying degrees of body weight and eating behavior  ap. 90-95.  aAIMS: The aim of this study was to determine the allele frequencies of resistance to inhibitors of cholinesterase 3 homologue (RIC-3) gene rs1528133 polymorphism in overweight+obese+morbid obese and non-obese (non-OB) subjects. The effects of rs1528133 genotypes on anthropometric, diabetes and obesity related parameters, self-reported macronutrient intake and drugs were also evaluated. The study was performed on overweight+obese+morbid obese and non-obese subjects. METHODS: RIC-3 gene rs1528133 genotypes were determined with qPCR. RESULTS: The RIC-3 rs1528133 genotype frequencies were respectively as 89.4% for homozygous wild type (A/A), 10.6% for heterozygous (A/C) genotypes in overweight+obese+morbid obese patients and 92.7% for A/A, 7.3% for A/C genotypes in non-OB subjects. The homozygous mutant genotype (C/C) was not detected in our study population. Genotype frequencies were not significantly different among study groups. Heterozygous genotype carriers for the rs1528133 polymorphism were found to prefer higher glycemic load, fat and protein diet content compared to homozygous wild type genotype carriers (p=0.0001). The frequency of rs1528133 heterozygous individuals (16.7%) using antihypertensive drugs was lower (p=0.045) in comparison to wild type genotype carriers (46.9%) in the whole study population. CONCLUSIONS: RIC-3 gene rs1528133 variation was not found to be effective over any analyzed obesity related parameter, but associated with higher glycemic load, protein and fat eating behavior and antihypertensive drug use.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantihypertensive agents 3acholinesterase inhibitors 3adiabetes 3adietary protein 3aeating habits 3agene frequency 3agenes 3aheterozygosity 3ahomozygosity 3amutants 3aobesity 3apatients 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction1 aKahveci, Cigdem1 aBayer, Hikmet1 aCagatay, Penbe1 aYildiz, Sema1 aBagriacik, Nazif1 aSusleyici-Duman, Belgin0 tDiabetes & metabolic syndrome: clinical research & reviews.g2012 , v. 6, no. 2 p.90-95dElsevier Ltdx1871-40217nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.dsx.2012.08.0013Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02661naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100005900152245007500211300001600286520155000302592002801852650002901880650001801909650001101927650001101938650003001949650001401979650001201993651001802005653002002023653001802043653002602061653001802087773009902105856008602204852000902290655001202299IND60597270920221118055929.0180624e20180915xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059727092DNAL7 a10.1016/j.geomorph.2018.05.0212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJames, L.

Little has been written, however, to identify implicit or explicit theories about how these deposits form and evolve over decennial to centennial time scales. This review attempts to redress this void by examining conceptual models of the physical behavior and characteristics of catchment-scale anthropic fluvial sedimentation events. These concepts, which are not unique to anthropogenic sediment, include cascades, sediment delivery ratios, waves, aggradation-degradation episodes, residence times, budgets, connectivity, stream power, nonlinear dynamical systems, and geohistorical, geoarchaeological, and chronostratigraphic principles. A broad definition of legacy sediment as episodically produced anthropogenic sediment is adopted that includes early episodes of large-scale, human-induced sedimentation throughout the world. The models apply to a variety of environments, so the examples from North America following the introduction of European settlement can be related to other post-settlement sedimentation episodes elsewhere. During aggradation episodes, rates of erosion and sedimentation often increased an order of magnitude in response to land clearance for agriculture, timbering, or mining. These sediments may remain as a lasting geomorphic legacy that provides evidence of anthropogenic change and governs modern rates of sediment production and nonpoint source pollution.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanthropogenic activities 3aland clearing 3amining 3amodels 3anonpoint source pollution 3asediments 3astreams 3aNorth America 0aLegacy sediment 0aHuman impacts 0aFluvial geomorphology 0aSedimentation0 tGeomorphology.g2018 Sept. 15, v. 317 p.199-217dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12407x0169-555X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.geomorph.2018.05.0213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02851naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245013800164300001500302520144000317592002801757650001801785650001101803650002801814650002201842650002401864650002201888650002201910650001701932650002501949650001001974650001201984650002401996650001702020650001302037650002502050650001202075651001002087700001802097700001502115700001402130773012402144856008102268990002302349852000902372655001202381IND60094834220221122011914.0141104e201204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009483422DNAL7 a10.1016/j.dsx.2012.05.0162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPrasad, D.S.10aPrevalence and risk factors for diabetes and impaired glucose tolerance in Asian Indians: A community survey from urban Eastern India  ap. 96-101.  aOBJECTIVES: To determine the prevalence of diabetes and impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) and to identify risk factors for the same specific to an underdeveloped urban locale of Eastern India. METHODS: Study design. Population based cross-sectional study, with multistage random sampling technique. Setting. Urban city-dwellers in Orissa one of the poorest states of Eastern India bordering a prosperous state of Andhra Pradesh of Southern India. Participants. 1178 adults of 20–80 years age randomly selected from 37 electoral wards of urban populace. Definition and diagnosis of diabetes mellitus and IGT. These were based on a Report of a World Health Organiztion/International Diabetes Federation Consultation of 2006. Main outcome measure. Prevalence and significant risk factors for Diabetes and IGT. Statistical analysis. Both descriptive and multivariable logistic regression analyses. RESULTS: The crude rates of diabetes and IGT in the study population were 15.7% and 8.8%, respectively. Similarly age-standardized rates of diabetes and IGT were 11.1% and 6.7%, respectively. Both diabetes and IGT had shown a male preponderance. CONCLUSION: Diabetes and IGT were very highly prevalent in this urban populace. Cardiometabolic risk factors like older age, central obesity, inadequate fruit intake, hypertension, hypertriglyceridemia and socio economic status were found to be significant predictors of diabetes in this study.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAsian Indians 3aadults 3across-sectional studies 3adiabetes mellitus 3aexperimental design 3afruit consumption 3aglucose tolerance 3ahypertension 3ahypertriglyceridemia 3amales 3aobesity 3aregression analysis 3arisk factors 3asampling 3asocioeconomic status 3asurveys 3aIndia1 aKabir, Zubair1 aDash, A.K.1 aDas, B.C.0 tDiabetes & metabolic syndrome: clinical research & reviews.g2012 , v. 6, no. 2 p.96-101dElsevier Ltdx1871-40217nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.dsx.2012.05.0163Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02076naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245008500170300001600255520084900271592002801120650001601148650002001164650001301184650001501197650002101212650001201233650002201245650002601267650001201293650001501305653000801320653000801328653000801336653002001344653003401364653003401398700002201432773010601454856008501560852000901645655001201654IND60599783520221121044217.0180702e201309  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059978352DNAL7 a10.1016/j.econlet.2013.05.0222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBrown, Heather10aBorn to be wide?

A novel decomposition approach from quantitative genetics is used to estimate the contribution of maternal characteristics, household income, and adolescent behaviours on the intergenerational correlation in BMI. The analysis uses data on mothers and their adolescent children from the British Household Panel Survey. The overall intergenerational correlation in BMI is 0.25. Maternal educational attainment and adolescent participation in daily physical activity are the largest contributing factors to the intergenerational correlation in BMI. Maternal employment and high daily television viewing by the adolescent are also contributing factors.

As a high-risk environment for the transmission of infectious agents, it is extremely important to implement programs for the surveillance of nosocomial microorganisms in these facilities. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the level of bacterial contamination of the BICU environmental surfaces and to implement corrective actions on disinfection protocols. Swab samples were collected from selected environmental surfaces in 3 different areas of the BICU (isolation, work, and preparatory rooms) to evaluate the total aerobic bacterial load and investigate the presence of 4 nosocomial microorganisms: vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus spp., methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, 3rd-generation cephalosporin-resistant Escherichia coli, and carbapenem-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Bacterial quantification was performed by using non-selective media, while specific selective media were used for the isolation of the target microorganisms. Isolates were identified based on their macro and microscopic characteristics and their biochemical profile. Subsequently, new disinfection protocols were implemented, and their effectiveness evaluated. RESULTS: The surfaces with the highest bacterial load in the isolation, preparatory, and worker’s rooms were the cages, hand-held sponge, and telephone, respectively. Regarding the 4 pathogens investigated, Enterococcus spp. were the most frequently isolated (11.3%), followed by E. coli (1.5%) and P. aeruginosa (1.5%). One of the P. aeruginosa isolates obtained was resistant to imipenem. In the end, new disinfection protocols were implemented, which proved to be effective in reducing bacterial counts by 99.99% in cages and the sponge, and by 90 to 99% on the telephone. CONCLUSIONS: This study allows to conclude that the cages and the human contact surfaces were the most contaminated in the isolation rooms. Nevertheless, the new disinfection strategies seemed to be effective in reducing environmental contamination, including by some potentially nosocomial agents, although more samples must be analyzed for definitive conclusions. These results may contribute to highlight the importance of infection prevention and control measures, as fundamental tools to reduce the spread of infectious agents in the hospital environment.  aPublisher supplied data  aProject UIDB/00276/2020cFCT 3aEnterococcus 3aEscherichia coli 3aPseudomonas aeruginosa 3abacterial contamination 3across infection 3adisinfection 3ahospitals 3ahumans 3aimipenem 3amethicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus 3amicrobial load 3amonitoring 3apollution 3atelephones 3aveterinary medicine 3aPortugal1 aCarneiro, C.1 aMachado, I.1 aTavares, L.1 aAlmeida, V.1 aOliveira, M.1 aGil, S.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9565-62610 tIrish veterinary journal.g2021 Dec., v. 74, no. 1 p.18-18dBioMed CentralwJournal:J000001763x2046-04817nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13620-021-00197-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02498naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245012700169300001400296520113600310592002801446650002301474650001601497650002601513650001801539650001801557650003101575650001201606650001701618650000901635653002301644653002501667653000901692653002501701653001201726700001701738700001701755700001901772700001601791700002001807700002001827773009801847856008601945852000902031655001202040IND60560400020221118141044.0190319e201705  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056040002DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodhyd.2016.12.0262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDai, Qingyuan10aCritical desiccation state Raman spectroscopy for simple, rapid and sensitive detection of native and glycosylated protein  ap. 90-98.  aA simple, rapid, and sensitive method named critical desiccation state Raman spectroscopy (CDSRS) has been developed for detecting native and glycosylated protein. Raman spectroscopy was performed within 1 min and without background subtraction. Results showed that Raman intensity of 1 μL of low concentration dispersions of biomacromolecule analytes remarkably increased from weak to high signal-to-noise ratio during the progressive desiccation process, and high-quality CDSRS spectra of biomacromolecule analytes could easily be obtained under the critical desiccation state, especially those such as zein and whey protein isolate-dextran conjugate which were difficult and even impossible to detect from their solid powders or low concentration dispersions by conventional Raman spectroscopy. Therefore, CDSRS would provide an opportunity to obtain high-quality Raman spectra from biomacromolecule analytes, which would be beneficial to elucidate the relationship between secondary structures and functional properties of protein and to control the formation of food hydrocolloids with desirable physicochemical properties.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRaman spectroscopy 3adispersions 3afunctional properties 3aglycosylation 3ahydrocolloids 3aphysicochemical properties 3apowders 3awhey protein 3azein 0aRaman spectroscopy 0aGlycosylated protein 0aZein 0aWhey protein isolate 0aDextran1 aZhu, Xiuling1 aYu, Jingyang1 aKarangwa, Eric1 aXia, Shuqin1 aZhang, Xiaoming1 aJia, Chengsheng0 tFood hydrocolloids.g2017 May, v. 66 p.90-98dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46643x0268-005X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodhyd.2016.12.0263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01182naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002300151245008100174300001600255520028800271592002800559650001400587650001200601650000900613653000700622653001200629653001800641653002100659773010600680856008500786852000900871655001200880IND60599783620221121024811.0180702e201309  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059978362DNAL7 a10.1016/j.econlet.2013.05.0232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGallardo, Mauricio10aUsing the downside mean-semideviation for measuring vulnerability to poverty  ap. 416-418.  aThis paper introduces a new approach for measuring vulnerability to poverty, using the standard downside mean-semideviation as a risk parameter.

Here, we investigated whether heat shock protein 20 (hsp20) in Japanese flounder played a role in immune reactions against Edwardsiella tarda. Hsp20 is ubiquitously produced by cells in the stress response; it not only functions as a chaperone and housekeeping protein but also participates in the immune response during infection. In this study, we identified and annotated 13 hsp20 genes using bioinformatic methods in Japanese flounder. Phylogenetic and selection pressure analysis showed that the hsp20 genes were evolutionarily-constrained and their function was conserved. Hsp20 genes are also involved in the embryogenesis and act as the sentinel role in an unchallenged organism. Moreover, the regulated expression patterns of hsp20 genes after E. tarda infection were examined for the first time in Japanese flounder. Eleven out of 13 genes were differentially expressed after bacterial challenge, which indicated that they may be involved in disease response genes or as disease defence against pathogens. These results provide valuable information for clarifying the evolutionary relationship of the hsp20 genes, and early insights into the immune functions of hsp20 genes in Japanese flounder.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEdwardsiella tarda 3aParalichthys olivaceus 3abacterial infections 3abioinformatics 3aembryogenesis 3aflounder 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3aheat shock proteins 3aheat stress 3aimmune response 3apathogens 3aphylogeny 3aselection pressure 3astress response 0aHeat shock protein 0aHsp20 0aJapanese flounder 0aEdwardsiella tarda 0aImmune response1 aQiao, Yingjie1 aHe, Jia-Yi,1 aWang, Qian1 aChen, Ziqi1 aNi, Feifei1 aLiu, Yuxiang1 aLiu, Xiumei1 aZhang, Quanqi1 aWang, Xubo0 tAquaculture.g2020 Dec. 15, v. 529 p.735722-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl59663x0044-84867nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquaculture.2020.7357223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02785naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245014000166300001600306520136400322592002801686650000801714650002501722650002801747650003801775650000901813650001901822650001301841650001701854650004301871650001301914650003001927650003001957650004501987650001702032650001502049700002002064700002902084773012502113856008102238990002302319852000902342655001202351IND60094834320221122011919.0141104e201204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009483432DNAL7 a10.1016/j.dsx.2012.05.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSaini, Vandana10aEndothelial nitric oxide synthase Glu298Asp (G894T) gene polymorphism in coronary artery disease patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus  ap. 106-109.  aAIMS: Endothelial dysfunction is thought to be a significant risk factor for cardiovascular disease. This study determined the role of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) Glu298Asp polymorphism and intergenotypic variation of plasma nitric oxide (NO) levels in coronary artery disease (CAD) patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM). METHODS: This case–control study included 28 documented CAD patients with type 2 DM and 32 non-diabetic patients with CAD. Fifty healthy volunteers without any major cardiovascular risk factors served as controls. NO was estimated by modified Griess method. The eNOS gene polymorphism was studied by amplifying DNA by PCR and digesting with BanII restriction enzyme. Restriction fragment length polymorphism was studied by using a gel documentation system. RESULTS: The genotype frequencies for Glu298Asp (GT) genotype were 10.71% in diabetic CAD patients, 28.1% in non-diabetic CAD patients and 12% in controls. The T allele frequency was higher in the non-diabetic CAD group (14%) as compared with the diabetic CAD (5.4%) and control group (6%). NO level was significantly lower in non-diabetic CAD patients (10.25mmol/L) but not in diabetic CAD patients (13.89mmol/L) as compared to controls (16.78mmol/L). CONCLUSION: Glu298Asp polymorphism is not the mediator of increased incidence of CAD in diabetic patients.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3acase-control studies 3acoronary artery disease 3aendothelial nitric oxide synthase 3agels 3agene frequency 3agenotype 3anitric oxide 3anoninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus 3apatients 3apolymerase chain reaction 3arestriction endonucleases 3arestriction fragment length polymorphism 3arisk factors 3avolunteers1 aBhatnagar, M.K.1 aBhattacharjee, Jayashree0 tDiabetes & metabolic syndrome: clinical research & reviews.g2012 , v. 6, no. 2 p.106-109dElsevier Ltdx1871-40217nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.dsx.2012.05.0013Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02824naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001500151245013900166300002000305520130000325592002801625650001401653650001901667650002001686650001101706650001901717650001101736650001701747650002401764650001401788650002001802650001601822650002101838650002201859650003701881653003001918653002401948653002601972653001601998653001802014700001802032700001502050700002002065700001802085773013302103856008502236852000902321655001202330IND60586474020221118041628.0171213e20171204xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058647402DNAL7 a10.1021/acssuschemeng.7b016742doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJiang, Guo10aHigh Oxygen Barrier Property of Poly(propylene carbonate)/Polyethylene Glycol Nanocomposites with Low Loading of Cellulose Nanocrytals  ap. 11246-11254.  aBionanocomposites of poly(propylene carbonate) (PPC) enhanced by cellulose nanocrytals (CNCs) are prepared via a two-step process using polyethylene glycol (PEG) as a carrier. Interfacial interaction among PPC, PEG, and CNCs, dispersion of CNCs in bionanocomposites, thermal properties, mechanical behavior, oxygen barrier property, and rheological responses are investigated. The obtained PPC/PEG/CNC nanocomposites display obvious improvement of barrier properties by adding an extremely low loading of CNCs. O₂ permeability is decreased by more than 76% at CNC loading of 0.3 wt %. The Cussler model works better to predict gas barrier for nanocomposites. TEM results show that CNC is well dispersed in the matrix, and the introduction of CNC remarkably increases the tensile strength and storage modulus of PPC. Interestingly, elongation at break of the PPC/PEG/CNC nanocomposite remains above 580%. Moreover, the inclusion of CNCs increases the thermal stability and initial decomposition temperature (T–₅%) of nanocomposites. The T–₅% for the PPC/PEG/0.7CNC nanocomposite is approximately 246.5 °C, which is increased by 17.1% compared with that of pure PPC (210.5 °C). This makes PPC/PEG/CNC nanocomposites a very promising degradable material for food packaging applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3acellulose 3afood packaging 3agreen chemistry 3amodels 3ananocomposites 3aoxygen 3apermeability 3apolyethylene glycol 3apropylene 3astorage modulus 3atemperature 3atensile strength 3athermal stability 3atransmission electron microscopy 0aPoly(propylene carbonate) 0aPolyethylene glycol 0aCellulose nanocrytals 0aGas barrier 0aCussler model1 aZhang, Mengdi1 aFeng, Jian1 aZhang, Shuidong1 aWang, Xiaohui0 tACS sustainable chemistry .g2017 Dec. 04, v. 5, no. 12 p.11246-11254dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23317x2168-04857nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acssuschemeng.7b016743Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02924naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002200150245010600172300002000278520159000298592002801888650001301916650002501929650001101954650001601965650001701981650004401998650001902042650002002061650001002081700002202091700003002113700002202143700001802165700002002183700002602203700006002229773013202289856008402421852000902505655001202514IND60752645020220218000000.0211005e20210921xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075264502DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.analchem.1c016182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVučković, Ivan,10a¹H Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy-Based Methods for the Quantification of Proteins in Urine  ap. 13177-13186.  aWe described several postprocessing methods to measure protein concentrations in human urine from existing ¹H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) metabolomic spectra: (1) direct spectral integration, (2) integration of NCD spectra (NCD = 1D NOESY-CPMG), (3) integration of SMolESY-filtered 1D NOESY spectra (SMolESY = Small Molecule Enhancement SpectroscopY), (4) matching protein patterns, and (5) TSP line integral and TSP linewidth. Postprocessing consists of (a) removal of the metabolite signals (demetabolization) and (b) extraction of the protein integral from the demetabolized spectra. For demetabolization, we tested subtraction of the spin-echo 1D spectrum (CPMG) from the regular 1D spectrum and low-pass filtering of 1D NOESY by its derivatives (c-SMolESY). Because of imperfections in the demetabolization, in addition to direct integration, we extracted protein integrals by the piecewise comparison of demetabolized spectra with the reference spectrum of albumin. We analyzed 42 urine samples with protein content known from the bicinchoninic acid (BCA) assay. We found excellent correlation between the BCA assay and the demetabolized NMR integrals. We have provided conversion factors for calculating protein concentrations in mg/mL from spectral integrals in mM. Additionally, we found the trimethylsilyl propionate (TSP, NMR standard) spectral linewidth and the TSP integral to be good indicators of protein concentration. The described methods increase the information content of urine NMR metabolomics spectra by informing clinical studies of protein concentration.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalbumins 3aanalytical chemistry 3ahumans 3ametabolites 3ametabolomics 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3apropionic acid 3aprotein content 3aurine1 aDenic, Aleksandar1 aCharlesworth, M.

Pancreatic Duodenal Homeobox-1 (PDX-1) is a homeobox protein which acts as a key regulator in the development of b cells in the Islets of Langerhans. It plays an important role in maintaining the identity and function of the Islets of Langerhans, and in the development of the pancreas. There is strong evidence that PDX-1 plays a role in activating the insulin promoter and increasing insulin levels in response to glucose. PDX-1 also binds to sequences within β cells and regulates the promoter activity of a number of islet genes including insulin, glut-2 and neurogenin 3. When fused with the VP16 activation sequence, transfection of the PDX-1 gene has been shown to transform liver cells into insulin producing cells. Because homeobox proteins are able to passively translocate through cell membranes, due to an intrinsic transduction domain (penetratin), the use of these proteins to reprogram target cells may help overcome the limiting supply of β cells and be a potential future treatment for Type 1 diabetes.  aPublisher supplied data 3acell membranes 3acell proliferation 3agenes 3aglucose 3ahepatocytes 3ahomeodomain proteins 3ainsulin 3ainsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus 3aislets of Langerhans 3astem cells 3atranscription factors 3atransfection0 tDiabetes & metabolic syndrome: clinical research & reviews.g2012 , v. 6, no. 2 p.113-119dElsevier Ltdx1871-40217nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.dsx.2012.05.0183Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03279naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100002000155245014200175520170400317592002802021650002202049650000802071650002602079650001002105650001102115650002202126650002602148650004102174650001502215650001402230650001902244650002602263650001602289650001502305650001702320650001202337650002402349650001902373653002302392653001902415653001302434653002502447653002302472700002202495700002202517700002402539773009902563856009002662852000902752655001202761IND60701886220221120113039.0210909e20201215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070188622DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aquaculture.2020.7356572doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNguyen, Thao V.10aPhysiological stress associated with mechanical harvesting and transport of cultured mussels (Perna canaliculus): A metabolomics approach  aHarvest and transport of farmed mussels are known to impose stress on the crop species. However, not much is known about molecular pathways underlying these physiological stresses. The present study investigated the effects of harvesting on the metabolome of the haemolymph and hepatopancreas of green-lipped mussels (Perna canaliculus), complemented by assessments of behaviour and survival under simulated dry and re-immersion live shipment scenarios. The gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC–MS)-based metabolomics approach was used to compare the metabolite profiles of control mussels (sampled directly from growing lines) with mechanically harvested mussels and post-transport mussels (after 3 h transport in water). The results showed differences in a large number of metabolites in both haemolymph and hepatopancreas of post-harvest and post-transport mussels when compared to the control state. These metabolites are generally involved in energy metabolism, amino acid metabolism, protein degradation and fatty acid metabolism. Mechanical harvesting induced metabolite changes typically associated with increased energy demand and a rapid transition to anaerobic glycolysis. Some metabolites began to return to baseline levels following a subsequent 3 h immersion during transportation. Re-immersion was also effective in prolonging life in mussels emersed in 9 °C air for three days. However, after six days emersion the mussels were moribund, dying after a total of 7.8 ± 1.0 days in air or in the re-immersion tank. The findings highlight the importance of acute metabolic trauma in determining post-harvest outcomes and the potential role for transient recovery systems.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPerna canaliculus 3aair 3aamino acid metabolism 3acrops 3aenergy 3aenergy metabolism 3afatty acid metabolism 3agas chromatography-mass spectrometry 3aglycolysis 3ahemolymph 3ahepatopancreas 3amechanical harvesting 3ametabolites 3ametabolome 3ametabolomics 3amussels 3aprotein degradation 3atransportation 0aGreenshell mussels 0aLive transport 0aSurvival 0aPhysiological stress 0aMetabolic profiles1 aRagg, Norman L.C.1 aAlfaro, Andrea C.1 aZamora, Leonardo N.0 tAquaculture.g2020 Dec. 15, v. 529 p.735657-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl59663x0044-84867nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquaculture.2020.7356573Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02667naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001800143245013900161300001600300520142700316592002801743650002001771650002001791650001501811650001001826650001301836650000901849650001701858650001901875650001601894650002301910650001001933650001301943700001601956773014001972852000902112856007702121930003302198945001302231946001302244655001202257IND60438405520221122224338.0151023e199810  nyu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6043840552DNAL7 a10.1007/s0024499003932doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGruber, S.

Carp were collected from a lake (Royal Lake) that receives most of its water from irrigation return flows and from a reference lake (Billy Clapp Lake) outside of the irrigation system. Results indicated that the mean whole-brain ChE activity of carp from Royal Lake (3.47 μmol/min/g tissue) was 34.2% less than that of carp from Billy Clapp Lake (5.27 μmol/min/g tissue) (p = 0.003). The depressed ChE activity in brain tissue of Royal Lake carp was in response to ChE-inhibiting insecticides detected in water samples in the weeks prior to tissue sampling; the most frequently detected insecticides included chlorpyrifos, azinphos-methyl, carbaryl, and ethoprop. Neither sex nor size appears to be a covariable in the analysis; ChE activity was not correlated with fish length or weight in either lake and there was no significant difference in ChE activity between the two sexes within each lake. Although organophosphate and carbamate insecticides can break down rapidly in the environment, this study suggests that in agricultural regions where insecticides are applied for extended periods of the year, nontarget aquatic biota may be exposed to high levels of ChE-inhibiting insecticides for a period of several months.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCyprinus carpio 3aazinphos-methyl 3abiomarkers 3abrain 3acarbaryl 3acarp 3achlorpyrifos 3acholinesterase 3aethoprophos 3airrigation systems 3alakes 3asampling1 aMunn, M.

The proposed palette of acids, including saturated fatty acids (SFA), monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA), and polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), determined separately in the foot tissues and hepatopancreas of Gastropoda, can be used in ecotoxicological research as a reliable test of the effect of trace doses of stressors. The final set of the biomarker FA comprised C16:0; C18:0; C23:0; C18:1 n-9; C20:1 n-9; C18:2 n-6; C18:3 n-3; C20:2; C20:4 n-6; C20:5 n-3; C22:4 n-6; and C22:5 n-3. A clear physiological response manifested as changes in the content of fatty acids (FA) was observed in the snails even in the case of the lowest doses of the pollutants. All experimental factors analyzed, i.e., the dose (5, 10, or 15 μl 0.01% w/v concentration) and the type of preparation (metaldehyde, methiocarb or PC), had a significant (p ≤ 0.01) impact on the FA composition of the foot and hepatopancreas. Limitation of the analysis to a narrow pool of reactive FA meets the requirements of parameters of biomarkers of exposure and facilitates and accelerates visualization of the bioindicator organism's response to the presence of the stressor in the environment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHelix pomatia 3abiomarkers 3aecotoxicology 3afatty acid composition 3ahepatopancreas 3aindicator species 3ametaldehyde 3amethiocarb 3amolluscicides 3amonounsaturated fatty acids 3aphysiological response 3apollutants 3apolyunsaturated fatty acids 3apotassium chloride 3asaturated fatty acids 3asnails 3atissues 3atoxic substances 0aMolluscicide 0aFatty acid 0aSnail 0aBiomarker 0aXenobiotic1 aPecka, Stanisław1 aKowalczuk-Vasilev, Edyta0 tEnvironmental pollution.g2017 Mar., v. 222 p.138-145dElsevier Ltdx0269-74917nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2016.12.0683Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03337naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100005500152245016800207300001400375520197000389592002802359650001302387650001502400650001102415650001202426650001302438650001002451650001502461650001402476650002202490650001302512650002302525650001402548651001002562653002302572653003602595653001602631653002302647700001202670700001702682773009602699856008702795852000902882655001202891IND60597271420221118060205.0200128e20181001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059727142DNAL7 a10.1016/j.geomorph.2018.06.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Zhuolun1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4164-855110aRadiocarbon dating of aquatic gastropod shells and its significance in reconstructing Quaternary environmental changes in the Alashan Plateau of northwestern China  ap. 18-25.  aUsing landform evolution and lake sediment records to reconstruct Quaternary environmental changes requires reliable chronology. However, there is an ongoing debate regarding the fossil shells of aquatic gastropods in carbonate rock area to be used for radiocarbon dating. The focus of this debate is whether living gastropods incorporate the dead carbon, which would affect the accuracy of the dating results. Living aquatic gastropods were selected from habitats on carbonate terrain in arid region. In this study, 64 shell samples from living gastropods, including Cipangopaludina chinensis, Gyraulus convexiusculus, and Radix auricularia, collected from the Alashan Plateau of northwestern China, were dated by accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) ¹⁴C dating. The results revealed that only five samples (~8%) from the same site contained no dead carbon. The other 59 samples (~92%) contained dead carbon in various amounts: ~59% samples contained 0–10% dead carbon, and ~33% samples contained more than 10% dead carbon. Of the samples, 56 were Radix auricularia and their ¹⁴C ages varied from present to 3253 cal yr BP. Two of the samples were Gyraulus convexiusculus samples dated at 379 and 290 cal yr BP which are highly consistent with ¹⁴C ages of Radix auricularia samples from the same site. The other six Cipangopaludina chinensis samples were dated at 407–863 cal yr BP. Thus, most of living aquatic gastropods from habitats on carbonate terrain contained dead carbon. The amount of dead carbon in the gastropod shells was nonselective among the three species. Radiocarbon dating of aquatic gastropod shells may not be useful for studying processes that occurred over multi-millennial timescales at different localities in areas of carbonate rock. It is difficult to establish high-resolution chronologies using ¹⁴C ages of gastropod shells in arid regions with carbonate rocks unless the limestone effect has been corrected.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGyraulus 3aarid zones 3acarbon 3afossils 3ahabitats 3alakes 3alandscapes 3alimestone 3amass spectrometry 3aplateaus 3aradiocarbon dating 3asediments 3aChina 0aLandform evolution 0aQuaternary environmental change 0aRadiocarbon 0aNorthwestern China1 aHe, Yue1 aChen, Qiujie0 tGeomorphology.g2018 Oct. 01, v. 318 p.18-25dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12407x0169-555X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.geomorph.2018.06.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02727naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100005900151245010500210520133300315592002801648650000801676650001201684650001101696650001301707650000901720650001501729650001701744650000901761650003501770650001701805650001301822650002101835653003201856653003601888653002101924653004101945653001801986700005802004700002202062773011402084856008602198852000902284655001202293IND60702618820221121053416.0211106e20210115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070261882DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhazmat.2020.1234682doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Chia-Yang1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2515-871210aCombustion performance and emissions from torrefied and water washed biomass using a kg-scale burner  aThis study investigates wastes and biomass as alternative fuels in a kg-scale burner in terms of combustion characteristics and emissions. Water washing, torrefaction, and their combination are used to improve the properties of the wastes and biomass. The air pollutants in the exhaust of the burner are also analyzed. It could be concluded that the reactivity and average heat supply from the pretreatment are improved significantly. The improvement ratio of average heat supply can be up to 103.5 %, stemming from water-soluble ash removal during water washing. Torrefaction can lift the average heat supply due to the increment of fixed carbon content in the fuels, but it reduces the reactivity owing to the decrement of volatile matters. Most of the raw or pretreated materials can be directly combusted, as a result of lower regulated air pollutants (e.g., NOₓ, SO₂, CO) from them than from coal. Water washing can successfully remove chlorine in the wastes by dissolution since most of the chlorine in the wastes are in salt form. The chlorine reduction significantly reduces the HCl concentration (55–58 % reduction efficiency) and the toxicity concentration of polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans (78–84 %), while torrefaction increases the toxicity concentration owing to the de novo synthesis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3abiomass 3acarbon 3achlorine 3acoal 3acombustion 3adibenzofuran 3aheat 3apolychlorinated dibenzodioxins 3atorrefaction 3atoxicity 3awater solubility 0aTorrefaction and combustion 0aIntermediate waste epoxy resins 0aBiomass and coal 0aPersistent organic pollutants (POPs) 0aWater washing1 aChen, Wei-Hsin1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5009-39601 aHung, Chung-Hsien0 tJournal of hazardous materials.g2021 Jan. 15, v. 402 p.123468-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6200x0304-38947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2020.1234683Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02966naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002300148245010700171300001600278520152100294592002801815650001301843650001101856650002101867650001101888650001701899650001101916650003101927650001301958650001501971650001001986650001901996650001602015650000902031650001702040650001102057653002102068653001602089653001802105653003102123653001602154700002002170700002102190700002202211700001902233773011602252856008302368852000902451655001202460IND60615798620221122134123.0190415e201810  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061579862DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ufug.2018.09.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aManickathan, Lento10aComparative study of flow field and drag coefficient of model and small natural trees in a wind tunnel  ap. 230-239.  aThe influence of trees in urban areas is typically assessed using urban microclimate models. These models rely on wind tunnel experiments using small-scale tree models to verify and validate their predictions of the flow field. However, it is not known sufficiently to which extent small model trees used in wind tunnel studies can recreate the behavior of large trees found in cities. In the present study, the drag coefficient and the turbulent flow downstream of model trees are compared with the ones of natural trees of a similar size to determine whether both types of tree provide similar aerodynamic characteristics. Therefore, measurements of the drag force and the flow field, using particle image velocimetry, are performed. The aerodynamic characteristics of the small trees are compared with the ones measured on larger mature trees from previous studies. The present study shows that the drag coefficients of model and natural trees are similar only if both types have a similar aerodynamic porosity and if the model tree can undergo an aerodynamic reconfiguration similar to that of a natural tree. Such reconfiguration implies the reorientation of the branches and leaves due to wind. A study on the influence of seasonal foliar density variation shows that the foliage configuration plays a critical role on the drag coefficient and the flow field. A defoliated tree, such as a deciduous tree in winter, is shown to have a substantially lower drag coefficient and a negligible influence on the flow.  aPublisher supplied data 3abranches 3acities 3adrag coefficient 3aleaves 3amicroclimate 3amodels 3aparticle image velocimetry 3aporosity 3aprediction 3atrees 3aturbulent flow 3aurban areas 3awind 3awind tunnels 3awinter 0aDrag coefficient 0aModel trees 0aNatural trees 0aParticle image velocimetry 0aWind tunnel1 aDefraeye, Thijs1 aAllegrini, Jonas1 aDerome, Dominique1 aCarmeliet, Jan0 tUrban forestry & urban greening.g2018 Oct., v. 35 p.230-239dElsevier GmbHwJournal:jnl893556x1618-86677nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ufug.2018.09.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02758naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001600146245004800162300001600210520135800226536024001584592002801824650001101852650002901863650001501892650002201907650001301929650002201942650001501964650001501979650001801994650001202012650001002024650001602034650001702050651001002067653001002077653002202087653001502109773011102124856008002235852000902315655001202324IND60620938520221122093049.0181114e201503  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062093852DNAL7 a10.1177/00027642145503042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNijman, Jan10aIndia’s Urban FuturebViews From the Slum  ap. 406-423.  aAbout 32% of the Indian population presently resides in towns and cities, and national and state governments are intent on increasing that number. Based on the past experience of most of the developed world, urbanization is considered integral to modernization and progress. However, India’s urbanization rate is particularly low and this is partly related to the country’s low level of industrialization. At the same time, urban slums have expanded and their populations have increased despite successive policies aimed at slum eradication or rehabilitation. This study aims to connect macro trends in urbanization and the space economy with a finer scale analysis of the logic of slums and slum dweller views in order to consider the future of India’s cities. Most of the data presented here are based on extensive surveys of households and firms in Dharavi (Mumbai) that investigated work, well-being, livelihoods, community, and environmental issues. It is argued that slums may well be a structural feature of India’s modern urban landscape given India’s enormous challenge of creating significant employment opportunities in modern industries. Furthermore, urban slum environments, with all their shortcomings and challenges, may be conducive to small-scale, labor-intensive productive activity and provide relatively secure livelihoods.  aFunding The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: The research in Dharavi was funded by the U.S. National Science Foundation, Grant BCS-0721025.  aPublisher supplied data 3acities 3aemployment opportunities 3ahouseholds 3aindustrialization 3aindustry 3aissues and policy 3alandscapes 3alivelihood 3amodernization 3asurveys 3atowns 3aurban areas 3aurbanization 3aIndia 0aIndia 0aslum urbanization 0awell-being0 tAmerican behavioral scientist.g, v. 59, no. 3 p.406-423dSAGE PublicationswJournal:2328x1552-33817nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/00027642145503043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02377naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245013200168300001600300520079000316592002801106650001501134650002501149650003001174650001801204650001701222650001201239650002001251650004401271650001101315650001901326650001301345650001101358653004401369653002401413653002801437653004401465653001501509653002001524700002001544700002801564700002301592700002401615700002401639700002601663773009201689856008101781852000901862655001201871IND60544694220221118043106.0160901e20140127xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054469422DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aca.2013.12.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOliver, James D.10aUnderstanding and improving direct UV detection of monosaccharides and disaccharides in free solution capillary electrophoresis  ap. 183-193.  aDirect UV detection of carbohydrates in free solution capillary electrophoresis at 270nm is made possible by a photo-oxidation reaction.

AMF inoculation is used to increase plant productivity, including in horticulture, and AMF are introduced into commercial peat-based substrates. Little is known, however, about long-term persistence of AMF in these substrates, especially if presuming adverse storage conditions. The study tested long-term infectivity of AMF introduced to a peat-based substrate stored in five different temperature regimes (constant temperatures of −20, 5 or 20 °C) and two outdoor regimes simulating actual practice (shade and direct sunlight). Eight AMF inocula were tested, including monocultures of Claroideoglomus claroideum, Funneliformis caledonium, and F. mosseae plus two isolates of Rhizophagus irregularis, all applied as 4% (v) of the substrate, or their mixture in 1%, 4% and 8% (v) doses. Their infectivity was monitored for 56 weeks at 8-week intervals as measured by mycorrhizal root colonization of bioassay plants. In general, infectivity significantly decreased with time, but in three regimes including periods of cold (5 °C, shade and sunlight), cold stratification probably broke spore dormancy and led to temporal stimulation of AMF infectivity. Except for storage at 5 °C, where a wider AMF spectrum maintained sufficient long-term viability, infectivity became very low after 1 year. Temperature fluctuations in direct sunlight were less negative than expected, whereas infectivity decline was surprisingly strong also in mild storage conditions (20 °C). Higher inoculum dose lengthened AMF infectivity. R. irregularis isolates were found most resistant among the tested AMF. We ascribe the general decline of infectivity to unfavorable properties inherent to peat.  aPublisher supplied data 3aClaroideoglomus claroideum 3aGlomus mosseae 3aRhizophagus irregularis 3abioassays 3acold 3adormancy 3ahorticulture 3ainoculum 3amycorrhizal fungi 3apathogenicity 3apeat 3asolar radiation 3aspores 3astorage temperature 3aviability 0aArbuscular mycorrhizal fungi 0aSurvival 0aInfectivity 0aStorage 0aTemperature regimes 0aPeat-based substrates1 aKolaříková, Zuzana1 aŠmilauer, Petr1 aRydlová, Jana0 tApplied soil ecology.g2019 Aug., v. 140 p.98-107dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl55717x0929-13937nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apsoil.2019.04.0203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04431naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002100152245016300173300001600336520268100352592002803033650001303061650001603074650001503090650001303105650001103118650001703129650002403146650002503170650001803195650001503213650001903228650000903247650002603256650001403282650001303296650001603309650002403325650002403349650002303373650001803396650001803414650001703432650002003449651001203469653002403481653003003505653002303535653002103558653002803579653001703607700002403624773009703648856008703745852000903832655001203841IND60112655820221120192031.0190214e201303  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011265582DNAL7 a10.1016/j.geoderma.2012.11.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSteffens, Markus10aLaboratory imaging spectroscopy of a stagnic Luvisol profile — High resolution soil characterisation, classification and mapping of elemental concentrations  ap. 122-132.  aThe physical and chemical heterogeneities of soils are the source of a multitude of spatial domains supporting a vast functional diversity of soil properties. But many studies do not consider the spatial variability of soil types, diagnostic horizons and properties. This lateral and vertical heterogeneities of soils or soil horizons are mostly neglected due to the limitations in the available soil data and missing techniques to gather the information. We present a fast imaging technique that enables the spatially accurate classification of diagnostic horizons and the mapping of various elemental concentrations (e.g. carbon and iron) for large, undisturbed soil samples (100×300mm) with a high spatial resolution of 63×63μm per pixel.We sampled a stagnic Luvisol (siltic, greyic) under a Norway spruce monoculture in southern Germany (Freising, Bavaria) using a stainless steel box (100×100×300mm3). A laboratory-based hyperspectral camera with a spectral range of 400 to 990nm in 160 bands and a ground sampling distance of 63×63μm per pixel was used. After recording the images, we took 66 samples from characteristic Luvisol horizons and representative spots and determined the concentrations of carbon, nitrogen, aluminium, iron and manganese with standard laboratory methods. These concentrations were correlated to the measured spectra of the sampled spots and used for regression analyses to extrapolate the elemental concentrations to the complete image. The image data of the soil profile was analysed in three different ways with increasing complexity: 1) geostatistics were used to assess the spatial variability of the soil profile as a whole without previous knowledge; 2) supervised spectral angle mapper classification was used to classify diagnostic horizons following the WRB guidelines; and 3) three different chemometric regression algorithms (narrow band indices, partial least square regression and support vector machine regression each used on reflectance spectra and continuum removed spectra) were tested to extrapolate the elemental concentrations of the sampling areas to the complete image and calculate high resolution chemometric maps of the five elements.Laboratory imaging spectroscopy enables the fast evaluation of a soil's spatial variability without previous knowledge, the mapping of diagnostic horizons, different qualities of OM, soil mottling and various elemental concentrations for large undisturbed soil samples with a high spatial resolution. It has the potential to significantly improve soil classification, assessment of elemental budgets and balances and the understanding of soil forming processes and mechanisms.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLuvisols 3aPicea abies 3aalgorithms 3aaluminum 3acarbon 3achemometrics 3adiagnostic horizons 3afunctional diversity 3ageostatistics 3aguidelines 3aimage analysis 3airon 3alaboratory techniques 3amanganese 3anitrogen 3areflectance 3aregression analysis 3asoil classification 3asoil heterogeneity 3asoil profiles 3asoil sampling 3aspectroscopy 3astainless steel 3aGermany 0aSoil classification 0aBidirectional reflectance 0aHyperspectral data 0aDigital soil map 0a“Elemental mapping” 0aChemometrics1 aBuddenbaum, Henning0 tGeoderma.g2013 Mar., v. 195-196 p.122-132dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl16374x0016-70617nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.geoderma.2012.11.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03774naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100006600151245007500217520258000292592002802872650001102900650001102911650001202922650001902934650001202953650002502965651001502990653001603005653002003021653003903041653003103080653003703111700005603148773011303204856008603317852000903403655001203412IND60766434220221117033348.0221004e20220315xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076643422DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2022.1308252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCakrabartī, Rathīna,1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7407-764X10aEconomical use of water in cotton knit dyeing industries of Bangladesh  aTextile knit dyeing industries of Bangladesh are playing a significant role in the country's economy and retain above forty percent of the total annual export performance. Economical use of water in the knit dyeing industries may lead to reduce water consumption significantly, thereby availing environmental sustainability. This study was undertaken to explore the possibility of minimizing water use in the cotton knit dyeing process without hampering the fabric quality and find out the resulting environmental and economic benefits. Currently, there are no published color-wise water consumption data for dyeing one kg of knit fabric available from Bangladesh cotton knit dyeing industries. Therefore, the primary information about water consumption has been generated by site visiting and auditing bulk production of some selected cotton knit dyeing industries. Material balance and right first time (RFT) approaches are exploited for generating stepwise water consumption scenarios. Minimum volume of adequate water required for each reactive dyeing has been estimated. The total volume of water consumed by cotton knit dyeing industries of Bangladesh was about 85.87 million cubic meters in the year 2019–2020. It has been estimated that 1 L less water consumption to produce 1 kg of fabric can save 7.80 percent of chemical cost. These estimates suggest that it is imperative to monitor every dyeing step carefully for reducing water consumption without compromising the quality of dyeing and fabric. The analyses of the collected knit dyeing processing data reveal that water consumption quantity varies with the factors like design of the dyeing machine, efficiency of the machine pump, types of wet processing and fabric, know-how (knowledge) and with adaptation of new technologies or processes. Many new approaches can be brought into practice to minimize water use during cotton knit dyeing processes. Finally, some sustainable alternative technologies, prospective techniques and recommendations are set forth based on the authors' extensive inspection, experience, spill-off knowledge and received information from previous studies to prompt economical use of water, thereby reducing water consumption in cotton knit dyeing industries of Bangladesh. The study concludes that predictive approaches, along with preventive measures for the reduction of water consumption in dyeing processes using sustainable technologies and practices, will make a paradigm shift from the reactive approach for wastewater management to the preservation of natural resources.  aPublisher supplied data 3acotton 3adyeing 3aexports 3afabric quality 3afabrics 3awastewater treatment 3aBangladesh 0aCotton knit 0aReactive dyeing 0aEconomical and ecological concerns 0aWater management and reuse 0aCleaner production opportunities1 aAhmad, Farid1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3196-93110 tJournal of cleaner production.g2022 Mar. 15, v. 340 p.130825-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2022.1308253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01717naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245010900164300001600273520061700289592002800906650001400934650001500948650001900963650001300982650003300995650001601028650002401044700001601068700001701084700001601101700001801117700002001135700001901155773011201174856004801286852000901334655001201343IND50066524220221121041219.0130518e201306  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006652422DNAL7 a10.1007/s00449-013-0903-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLee, Myunggu10aOptimization of enzymatic biodiesel synthesis using RSM in high pressure carbon dioxide and its scale up  ap. 775-780.  aEnzymatic synthesis of biodiesel by the transesterification of canola oil and methanol in high pressure carbon dioxide [HPCO₂: near-critical and supercritical carbon dioxide (NcCO₂ and ScCO₂)] was optimized using response surface methodology (RSM).

They show that no structural transition occurs up to 26 GPa. However, there is evidence of gradual disordering indicated by the broadening of the diffraction lines. p-V data fitted to a Birch-Murnaghan equation of state yields a value of the room-temperature, ambient-pressure bulk modulus of 77.3 GPa with a pressure derivative of 4.03. It is proposed that under compression structural phase transitions resulting from static displacements of V ions that are observed at low temperature are suppressed. Instead, a partial “polymerization” of V ions that is dynamic in nature and allows enhanced hopping conduction, starts near 3 GPa and saturates above 15 GPa.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3aambient temperature 3aelectrical resistance 3aequations 3aions 3aphase transition 0aHigh Pressure 0aLow-dimensional Materials 0aX-Ray Diffraction 0aPhase Transitions 0aTransport Measurements1 aVijayakumar, Viswanathan1 aChoudhury, Amitava1 aHochheimer, Hans D.0 tZeitschrift für Naturforschung B.g2014 June 2, v. 63, no. 6 p.661-667dVerlag der Zeitschrift für Naturforschungx1865-71177nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1515/znb-2008-06113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03473naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100006900137245018600206300001800392500002000410520174500430592002802175650002302203650001202226650002202238650001702260650002002277650002302297650001602320650001402336650002702350650001002377650001402387650002302401650001902424650001202443650003102455650001502486650001002501650001502511650001602526650001402542651001102556651001302567700003202580700003102612700004402643700003802687773012602725856007102851852000902922655001202931IND60608314820221120031839.0180807e201809  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060831482DNAL7 a10.1002/ps.48952doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMaia, Artur Campos Dália1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8365-193810a2‐Alkyl‐3‐methoxypyrazines are potent attractants of florivorous scarabs (Melolonthidae, Cyclocephalini) associated with economically exploitable Neotropical palms (Arecaceae)  ap. 2053-2058.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aBACKGROUND: 2‐Alkyl‐3‐methoxypyrazines (MPs) are naturally occurring aromatic compounds involved in insect chemical communication as both pheromones and allelochemicals. Although rarely characterized in floral scents, they have been identified as major constituents in headspace samples from palm inflorescences and evidence pointed towards their function as attractive cues for scent‐oriented pollinators, as well as florivores. In this study, we investigated the occurrence of MPs in economically exploitable palms belonging to Acrocomia and Attalea through headspace floral scent analysis and assessed their role in the selective attraction of flower‐feeding cyclocephaline scarabs (Melolonthidae, Cyclocephalini) in field bioassays conducted in Brazil and Colombia. RESULTS: Three different MPs were identified among floral headspace samples of Acrocomia aculeata, Acr. intumescens, Attalea butyracea and Att. insignis: 2‐isopropyl‐3‐methoxypyrazine (IPMP), 2‐isobutyl‐3‐methoxypyrazine (IBMP) and 2‐(sec‐butyl)‐3‐methoxypyrazine (SBMP). Their combined estimated total scent emissions per inflorescence ranged from 246 μg h⁻¹ to 6.2 mg h⁻¹. Scented traps, individually baited with either IPMP or SBMP, resulted in species‐selective and high yield captures of Cyclocephala amazona and C. distincta, known florivores associated with over 20 different species of Neotropical palms. CONCLUSIONS: The identification of MPs as potent kairomones could prove instrumental in integrated pest management plans for these insects in emerging oil‐yielding crops in South America, including those of the wine palm (Att. butyracea) and macaw palms (Acrocomia spp.). © 2018 Society of Chemical Industry  aPublisher supplied data 3aAcrocomia aculeata 3aAmazona 3aAttalea butyracea 3aCyclocephala 3aallelochemicals 3aaromatic compounds 3aattractants 3abioassays 3achemical communication 3acrops 3aemissions 3aheadspace analysis 3ainflorescences 3ainsects 3aintegrated pest management 3akairomones 3aodors 3apheromones 3apollinators 3apyrazines 3aBrazil 3aColombia1 aSantos, Geanne Karla Novais1 aGonçalves, Eduardo Gomes,1 aNavarro, Daniela Maria do Amaral Ferraz1 aNuñez‐Avellaneda, Luis Alberto0 tPest management science.g2018 Sept., v. 74, no. 9 p.2053-2058dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl59519x1526-498X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ps.48953Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02428naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002200149245007300171520133000244592002801574650001601602650001601618650000901634650002801643650001101671650001001682700001901692700001901711700002201730700002201752700002201774700002001796700002301816773013401839856008401973852000902057655001202066IND60757557220221120111359.0211125e20211116xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075755722DNAL7 a10.3390/agriculture111111472doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMeskhi, Besarion 10aFinite Element and Applied Models of the Stem with Spike Deformation  aThis article examines the static and dynamic deformation of the stem of an ear of wheat and of the individual grain. The purpose of the article is to determine the factors of influence on the ear of wheat to isolate the grain. Two stages of grain ripening are considered: in the early stage, the grain is attached to the spike by the stem; in the second, there is no stem, and the grain is attached to the ear by the scales. The ear fluctuations are considered within the Euler–Bernoulli bar theory. The developed model divides the study of the dynamics of the stem of an ear and the dynamics of the grain into two stages. The first stage studies the dynamics of the plant as a whole, while the second stage studies the dynamics of an individual grain in a moving system associated with the ear in bending and vertical fluctuation forms. The model of the ear and the grain fluctuation uses the mechanical characteristics of elastic bonds and elastic bodies, which are determined by spring stiffness, elastic moduli, etc. The results show that in the vertical forms of grain fluctuation, the frequency of fluctuation is much higher than in the bending ones. This article presents the natural fluctuation frequencies of grain at full ripeness and in the early phases of maturation, at which point it is released from the ear.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagriculture 3adeformation 3aears 3afinite element analysis 3amodels 3awheat1 aRudoy, Dmitry 1 aLachuga, Yuri 1 aPakhomov, Viktor 1 aSoloviev, Arkady 1 aMatrosov, Andrey 1 aPanfilov, Ivan 1 aMaltseva, Tatyana 0 tAgriculture (Basel).g2021 Nov. 16, v. 11, no. 11dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:12387x2077-04727nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agriculture111111473Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01344naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100003200143245009200175300001600267520034300283592002800626650002300654650002300677650002300700653002100723653002900744653002700773700001900800773013700819856007700956852000901033655001201042IND60522335620221119144058.0160602e20140602xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052233562DNAL7 a10.1515/znb-2008-06122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aArroyo y de Dompablo, Elena12aA Comparative Study of GaAsO4 Polymorphs: ab initio Calculations on High-pressure Forms  ap. 668-672.  aFirst-principles calculations were performed to compare the relative stability and high-pressure behavior of four different GaAsO₄ polymorphs: the ordinary-pressure phase (berlinite, α-quartzlike) and three high-pressure phases: the β -VCrO₄-like, the rutile-like and a new hexagonal form, recently discovered and related to rutile.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemical compounds 3achemical reactions 3achemical structure 0aGallium Arsenate 0aHigh-pressure Polymorphs 0aab initio Calculations1 aMorán, Emilio0 tZeitschrift für Naturforschung B.g2014 June 2, v. 63, no. 6 p.668-672dVerlag der Zeitschrift für Naturforschungx1865-71177nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1515/znb-2008-06123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02436naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001900149245009400168520130700262592002801569650003301597650001101630650001601641650002401657650001601681650001401697650001701711650001401728651001201742700002701754700002001781700002701801700001901828773013401847856008401981852000902065655001202074IND60757557320221120132105.0211125e20211116xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075755732DNAL7 a10.3390/agriculture111111482doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLaribi, Marwa 10aDurum Wheat Mediterranean Landraces: A Valuable Source for Resistance to Tan Spot Disease  aTan spot (TS), caused by Pyrenophora tritici-repentis (Ptr), has gained significant importance in Tunisia. In this study, a Mediterranean durum wheat collection of 113 accessions were evaluated under field conditions, during the 2018–2019 cropping season, for resistance to Ptr at Koudia experimental station in Bou Salem (Tunisia). The disease progress curve (AUDPC) was used to screen this collection, and the effect of days to heading (DH) and plant height (PH) were evaluated in relation to TS resistance. No significant correlation of PH with AUDPC was found, yet a significant correlation (r = 0.212, p ≤ 0.05) was established between DH and AUDPC scores, suggesting that DH may have an effect on TS development. Moreover, correlation between seedling and adult reactions was significant (r = 0.695, p ≤ 0.001). Although susceptible accessions clustered separately from resistant accessions, the clustering was independent of the country of origin and the status of improvement of the wheat accessions. In total, 67% and 80% of resistant and moderately resistant accessions, respectively, were landraces, suggesting therefore the possible presence of novel sources of resistance to Ptr in some landraces, which can be used to establish a breeding program for resistance to tan spot disease.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPyrenophora tritici-repentis 3aadults 3aagriculture 3adisease progression 3adurum wheat 3alandraces 3aplant height 3aseedlings 3aTunisia1 aBen M’Barek, Sarrah 1 aFakhfakh, Moez 1 aYahyaoui, Amor Hassine1 aSassi, Khaled 0 tAgriculture (Basel).g2021 Nov. 16, v. 11, no. 11dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:12387x2077-04727nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agriculture111111483Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02160naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001700152245017200169300001800341520106600359592002801425650001801453650001001471650001001481650002101491650001801512650001401530650001501544650002401559700002101583700001701604700001801621773010701639856005501746852000901801655001201810IND4407692520221122160720.0120428e200807  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440769252DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-2109.2008.01963.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMayer, Pablo10aPredicting the growth of gilthead sea bream (Sparus aurata L.) farmed in marine cages under real production conditions using temperature‐ and time‐dependent models  ap. 1046-1052.  aThe growth of gilthead sea bream (Sparus aurata) has been studied considering five multiple exponential regression models using data from 20 lots of gilthead sea bream growing in 20 marine cages from a Mediterranean commercial fish farm. The final weight (Wf) of fish was predicted in relation to the initial weight (Wi), time (n) and temperature (T), or the sum of effective temperatures (∑Tef). The estimated weight results from the simulation using the five models have been compared with the real final weight values using the mean of the absolute values of the prediction errors in short and long term (the precision value). All models presented a high determination coefficient, above 96%, and good prediction values in the short term. Regression models were tested using data from six new cages. The best models for predicting the growth of sea bream long term were the ones where final weight is expressed in relation to the initial weight and the sum of effective temperature, and obtaining long‐term prediction errors 12.9% and 10.7% respectively.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSparus aurata 3abream 3acages 3acommercial farms 3agrowth models 3aheat sums 3aprediction 3aregression analysis1 aEstruch, Vicente1 aBlasco, Joan1 aJover, Miguel0 tAquaculture research.g2008 July, v. 39, no. 10 p.1046-1052dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx1355-557X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2109.2008.01963.x  aDNAL 7aarticle02687naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100005600145245013800201300002000339520143500359592002801794650001101822650001301833650001401846650002101860650001101881650001101892650001201903650001601915650002201931650001501953700001501968700001401983700001301997700001302010700001302023700001602036773013602052856008002188852000902268655001202277IND60559239720221119061310.0201214e20161103xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055923972DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.joc.6b020932doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Liu Leo1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4934-036710aMechanism of Nickel-Catalyzed Selective C–N Bond Activation in Suzuki-Miyaura Cross-Coupling of Amides: A Theoretical Investigation  ap. 11686-11696.  aIn textbooks, the low reactivity of amides is attributed to the strong resonance stability. However, Garg and co-workers recently reported the Ni-catalyzed activation of robust amide C–N bonds, leading to conversions of amides into esters, ketones, and other amides with high selectivity. Among them, the Ni-catalyzed Suzuki-Miyaura coupling (SMC) of N-benzyl-N-tert-butoxycarbonyl (N-Bn-N-Boc) amides with pinacolatoboronate (PhBpin) was performed in the presence of K₃PO₄ and water. Water significantly enhanced the reaction. With the aid of density functional theory (DFT) calculations, the present study explored the mechanism of the aforementioned SMC reaction as well as analyzed the weakening of amide C–N bond by N-functionalization. The most favorable pathway includes four basic steps: oxidative addition, protonation, transmetalation, and reductive elimination. Comparing the base- and water-free process, the transmetalation step with the help of K₃PO₄ and water is significantly more facile. Water efficiently protonates the basic N(Boc) (Bn) group to form a neutral HN(Boc) (Bn), which is easily removed. The transmetalation step is the rate-determining step with an energy barrier of 25.6 kcal/mol. Further, a DFT prediction was carried out to investigate the full catalytic cycle of a cyclic (amino) (aryl)carbene in the Ni-catalyzed SMC of amides, which provided clues for further design of catalysts.  aPublisher supplied data 3aamides 3acarbenes 3acatalysts 3achemical bonding 3aenergy 3aesters 3aketones 3amethodology 3aorganic chemistry 3aprediction1 aChen, Peng1 aSun, Ying1 aWu, Yile1 aChen, Su1 aZhu, Jun1 aZhao, Yufen0 tJournal of organic chemistry.g2016 Nov. 03, v. 81, no. 23 p.11686-11696dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19181x1520-69047nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.joc.6b020933Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02731naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100002000154245008700174300001800261520168500279592002801964650002101992650001202013650000902025650001102034650001402045650001402059650002402073650002502097650001802122650001302140651001102153700002002164773012102184856005502305852000902360655001202369IND50069494320221116161150.0130926e200703  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006949432DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-294X.2007.03233.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRASPÉ, OLIVIER10aPopulation structure at the S‐locus of Sorbus aucuparia L.

Nevertheless, sequence variation within functional alleles is essential for current models of the evolution of new mating types. We genotyped the stylar self‐incompatibility RNase of 20 Sorbus aucuparia from a population in the Pyrenees mountains of France in order to compare alleles found there to those previously sampled in a Belgian population. Both populations returned 20 different alleles from samples of 20 individuals, providing maximum‐likelihood estimates of 24.4 (95% CI 20–34) alleles in each. Ten alleles occurred in both samples. The maximum likelihood (ML) estimate of the overlap in the alleles present in both populations was 16, meaning that an estimated eight alleles are private to each population, and a total of 32 alleles occur across the two populations examined. We used Fisher's (1961) missing plot method to estimate that 40 alleles occur in the species. In accord with population genetics theory, we observed at most one synonymous sequence difference between copies of alleles sampled from the different populations and no variation within populations. Phylogenetic analysis shows that nearly every allele in S. aucuparia arose prior to divergence of this species from members of three different genera of the Rosaceae subfamily, Maloideae. Lack of observable sequence variation within alleles, coupled with the slow pace of allelic relative to taxonomic diversification, implies that finding intermediate stages in the process of new allele creation will be difficult in this group.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSorbus aucuparia 3aalleles 3aloci 3amodels 3amountains 3aphylogeny 3apopulation genetics 3apopulation structure 3aribonucleases 3asampling 3aFrance1 aKOHN, JOSHUA R.0 tMolecular ecology.g2007 Mar., v. 16, no. 6 p.1315-1325dBlackwell Publishing LtdwJournal:jnl48811x0962-10837nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-294X.2007.03233.x  aDNAL 7aarticle02531naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002100150245007700171300001400248520132800262592002801590650001501618650001101633650001901644650002801663650001301691650001401704650002501718650001101743653002901754653002301783653002701806653001901833700001401852700001601866700001801882700001901900700001801919773007901937856008402016852000902100655001202109IND60546769420221120235350.0160903e201512  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054676942DNAL7 a10.1016/j.wasman.2015.08.0412doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Chong-qing10aInterfacial interactions between plastic particles in plastics flotation  ap. 56-61.  aPlastics flotation used for recycling of plastic wastes receives increasing attention for its industrial application. In order to study the mechanism of plastics flotation, the interfacial interactions between plastic particles in flotation system were investigated through calculation of Lifshitz–van der Waals (LW) function, Lewis acid–base (AB) Gibbs function, and the extended Derjaguin–Landau–Verwey–Overbeek potential energy profiles. The results showed that van der Waals force between plastic particles is attraction force in flotation system. The large hydrophobic attraction, caused by the AB Gibbs function, is the dominant interparticle force. Wetting agents present significant effects on the interfacial interactions between plastic particles. It is found that adsorption of wetting agents promotes dispersion of plastic particles and decreases the floatability. Pneumatic flotation may improve the recovery and purity of separated plastics through selective adsorption of wetting agents on plastic surface. The relationships between hydrophobic attraction and surface properties were also examined. It is revealed that there exists a three-order polynomial relationship between the AB Gibbs function and Lewis base component. Our finding provides some insights into mechanism of plastics flotation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3aenergy 3ahydrophobicity 3aindustrial applications 3aplastics 3arecycling 3avan der Waals forces 3awastes 0aInterfacial interactions 0aPlastics flotation 0aHydrophobic attraction 0aSurface energy1 aWang, Hui1 aGu, Guo-hua1 aFu, Jian-gang1 aLin, Qing-quan1 aLiu, You-nian0 tWaste management.g2015 Dec., v. 46 p.56-61dElsevier Ltdx0956-053X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2015.08.0413Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03241naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245011600169300001400285520164700299592002801946650001701974650002501991650001602016650002602032650002202058650001602080650001102096650001802107650002602125650001302151650002102164650002202185650001802207650002402225650002602249650002402275650001902299650001102318651003102329653002402360653001402384653001802398653002102416653002402437700002202461700003202483773010202515856008502617852000902702655001202711IND60535625120221120234445.0190408e201406  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053562512DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apsoil.2014.02.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChavez, Holcer10aPopulation dynamics and interactions between plant parasitic and non-parasitic nematodes: An empirical analysis  ap. 11-17.  aNon-linear regression models were used to estimate the effect of own and other taxa previous population levels, nitrogen application, and crop rotation on population dynamics of Mononchidae, Dorylaimidae, microbivorous (Rhabditidae), lance (Hoplolaimus galeatus), spiral (Helicotylencus dihystera), stubby root (Paratrichodorus minor), lesion (Pratylenchus zeae), and cotton root-knot (Meloigogyne incognita) nematodes using data from the Cullars rotation, which is the oldest soil fertility experiment in the Southern United States. Because field experimental data was used, a spatial component was included as populations in one plot were proved to be related to the population level of their neighbors. Own previous levels were found to be very important for all eight groups of nematodes (all groups’ current population relied heavily on its own previous population value) and all the groups had an interaction effect with at least one other group. Lesion and cotton root-knot nematodes were found to be competitive while Mononchidae, Dorylaimidae, microbivorous and lance nematodes were non-competitive. All the populations showed high seasonality patterns having lower populations during winter, to then remain steady until September–October when there is a significant increase in the population of cotton root-knot, Dorylaimidae, microbivorous, and lesion nematodes. Nitrogen had a positive effect on Mononchidae, microbivorous, spiral, and cotton root-knot nematodes. The use of clover after cotton in the rotation crop program proved to be significantly better in reducing plant parasitic nematodes compared to other treatments.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDorylaimidae 3aHoplolaimus galeatus 3aMononchidae 3aParatrichodorus minor 3aPratylenchus zeae 3aRhabditidae 3acotton 3acrop rotation 3afield experimentation 3anitrogen 3aparasitic plants 3apopulation growth 3aprogram crops 3aregression analysis 3aroot lesion nematodes 3aroot-knot nematodes 3asoil fertility 3awinter 3aSoutheastern United States 0aPopulation dynamics 0aNematodes 0aCrop rotation 0aCullars rotation 0aRegression analysis1 aTaylor, C.

Field experiments were conducted in three different municipalities (Amargosa, Cruz das Almas and Santo António de Jesus) from Bahia region (Brazil) and two drying methodologies (natural and artificial with controlled conditions) were assessed. Fresh and dried leaves essential oils were extracted by hydro-distillation and their volatiles were determined by gas chromatography with a flame ionization detector (GC/FID) and by gas chromatography with a mass selective detector (GC/MS). The results showed that Cruz das Almas field reported higher biomass production and Santo Antônio de Jesus higher leaves essential oil content. The natural and artificial drying methodologies affected in a similar way the leaves essential oil content in each region, but they affected considerably their composition. Eighteen volatile constituents were identified, mainly sesquiterpenes and monoterpenes, where piperitenone oxide and germacrene D are in higher abundance. By applying a PCA it was possible to distinguish the fresh leaves from each region from the leaves dried by the different drying methodologies, highlighting the increase of minor compounds, mainly sesquiterpenes in the dried leaves from Santo Antônio de Jesus.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMentha spicata 3abiomass production 3adrying 3aessential oils 3afield experimentation 3agas chromatography 3agermacrene 3aionization 3aleaves 3alipid content 3amonoterpenoids 3aBrazil 0aMentha×villosa Hudson 0aGeographic origin 0aDrying methodology 0aEssential oil 0aVolatiles1 aPereira, José Alberto,1 aSantos, Carlos H.B.1 aMenezes, Renata V.1 aMalheiro, Ricardo1 aLucchese, Angélica M.1 aSilva, Franceli0 tIndustrial crops and products.g2013 Apr., v. 46 p.1-7dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl49222x0926-66907nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.indcrop.2012.12.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03261naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001900152245013600171300001200307520183400319592002802153650001302181650001702194650001802211650000902229650001602238650002202254650001202276650001102288650001702299650001902316650001502335651001002350653001702360653002302377653002402400653002502424653002802449700002302477700001902500700002102519700002502540700002502565773009302590856008702683852000902770655001202779IND60112656420221121022239.0190214e201304  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011265642DNAL7 a10.1016/j.geoderma.2012.12.0172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTanikawa, Toko10aSoil sulfur content and its spatial distribution in a small catchment covered by volcanic soil in the montane zone of central Japan  ap. 1-8.  aHigh concentrations of organic C and Al/Fe oxides, and low bulk density are responsible for the accumulation of large amounts of S compounds in volcanic soils. The purpose of our study was to clarify the spatial distribution of S compounds and determine the factors governing that distribution within the Katsura Headwater Catchment, a small drainage basin covered by volcanic soil in a mountainous area of the North Kanto district, central Japan. Geostatistical analysis revealed a strong spatial dependence of total S concentration throughout the catchment area. Total S concentrations were higher on upper slopes than on lower slopes, and higher in deeper soils (20–50cm depth) than in surface soils (0–20cm depth). Our analyses also revealed similar spatial variations of the characteristic pedogenic volcanic minerals properties (i.e., concentrations of oxalate extractable Al, Fe, and Si), total C concentrations, and bulk density. The strong relationships of total S with the pedogenic mineral properties indicate that the accumulation of S in the soils is governed predominantly by the abundance of those pedogenic minerals, and that the influence of volcanic ash as a parent material is reflected more strongly in residual soils than in colluvial soils. Because the total S concentrations of the residual and colluvial soils differ, so too do the S pools in the uppermost 50cm of these soils: residual soils retain larger amounts of S (2030±590kgSha–1 on average) than colluvial soils (1400±590kgSha–1 on average). Our results indicate that volcanic ash that remains in situ on the upper slopes of the small Katsura Headwater Catchment contributes strongly to the accumulation and spatial variation of S. Total C inputs from plant communities might also influence S accumulation, particularly in surface soils.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaluminum 3abulk density 3ageostatistics 3airon 3airon oxides 3aplant communities 3asilicon 3asulfur 3avolcanic ash 3avolcanic soils 3awatersheds 3aJapan 0aVolcanic ash 0aPedogenic minerals 0aSulfur accumulation 0aSpatial distribution 0aGeostatistical analysis1 aYamashita, Naoyuki1 aAizawa, Shuhei1 aOhnuki, Yasuhiro1 aYoshinaga, Shuichiro1 aTakahashi, Masamichi0 tGeoderma.g2013 Apr., v. 197-198 p.1-8dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl16374x0016-70617nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.geoderma.2012.12.0173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02349naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001500140245005700155300002000212520130600232592002801538650001301566650001401579650001401593700001701607700001601624700001601640700001401656700002201670700001801692700001901710700001601729700001501745773014301760856007501903852000901978655001201987IND60752715220221120185148.0211006e20211005xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075271522DNAL7 a10.1039/d1ta05600j2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Shu10aElement substitution of a spinel LiMn₂O₄ cathode  ap. 21532-21550.  aSpinel LiMn₂O₄ is a promising cathode material for lithium-ion batteries ascribed to its steady bulk structure and abundant manganese sources. Nevertheless, severe capacity decay due to the Jahn–Teller effect and spontaneous disproportionation reaction seriously hampers its extensive application, especially at high-temperature or high-potential operation circumstances. Attributed to the strengthening of the crystallographic structure and the inhibition of Mn³⁺ side reactions, element substitution has become one of the most momentous tactics in the modification of LiMn₂O₄. Here, we comprehensively review the developments on restraining capacity fading and enhancing the performances of LiMn₂O₄ through element substitution. Primarily, the capacity fading mechanism of LiMn₂O₄ has been thoroughly recapitulated. Subsequently, our summary is proposed based on two categories, which are phase evolution and solid solution strengthening invoked by element substitution, and the latter can be subdivided into structure strengthening and Li⁺ diffusion kinetics boosting. More importantly, we put forward a methodological approach for future element substitution research studies. This report will shed light on the future direction of LiMn₂O₄ cathode material optimization.  aPublisher supplied data 3acathodes 3achemistry 3amanganese1 aDeng, Wentao1 aMomen, Roya1 aYin, Shouyi1 aChen, Jun1 aMassoudi, Abouzar1 aZou, Guoqiang1 aHou, Hongshuai1 aDeng, Weina1 aJi, Xiaobo0 tJournal of materials chemistry A.g2021 Oct. 5, v. 9, no. 38 p.21532-21550dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26903x2050-74967nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d1ta05600j3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01871naa a2200277 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002700145245012900172300001600301520097300317592002801290650002301318650001101341650001401352651001201366700002001378700002001398773010601418856004801524852000901572655001201581IND4476159020221121164704.0120727e201111  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447615902DNAL7 a10.1007/s11852-010-0140-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSaïdi, Hanen Belgacem10aDetached breakwaters’ effects on a microtidal Mediterranean Coast, case of the Hammam-Lif littoral (North-East of Tunisia)  ap. 523-529.  aThe Hammam Lif shoreline, which is part of the Gulf of Tunis (North-East of Tunisia), suffered from a dramatic erosion event during a storm in 1981. Therefore, eight successive and detached breakwaters were built to protect it. The effect of these protection works on the evolution of this coastline is assessed using aerial photographs geo-referenced by digital photogrammetric methods. Results show that a general accretion has developed behind the detached breakwaters, with the formation of seven tombolos and one salient. The response of the coastline depends on the characteristics of the protective works (length, distance to coast, and spacing). Detached breakwaters which are short, far from the coastline and distant from each other, give rise to very small tombolos or salients. On the other hand, longer breakwaters which are near the coastline and closely spaced, give rise to more developed tombolos, showing that these structures are the most efficient.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaerial photography 3acoasts 3aevolution 3aTunisia1 aSouissi, Radhia1 aZargouni, Fouad0 tJournal of coastal conservation.g2011 Nov., v. 15, no. 4 p.523-529dSpringer-Verlagx1400-03507nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11852-010-0140-1  aDNAL 7aarticle02345naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002000143245012000163300001600283520107300299592002801372650002201400650001401422650001101436650002101447650001801468650000801486653001901494653001801513653001401531653002201545700002001567700002101587700002201608700002601630700002101656700002201677773015001699856007701849852000901926655001201935IND60522336020221119144133.0160602e20140602xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052233602DNAL7 a10.1515/znb-2008-06162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRiecken, Jan F.10aHigh-pressure / High-temperature Studies on the Stannides RENiSn (RE = Ce, Pr, Nd, Sm) and REPdSn (RE = La, Pr, Nd)  ap. 695-706.  aThe normal-pressure (NP) orthorhombic TiNiSi-type (space group Pnma) stannides RENiSn (RE = Ce, Pr, Nd, Sm) and REPdSn (RE = La, Pr, Nd) were transformed into the corresponding hexagonal ZrNiAl-type (space group P6̄2m) high-pressure (HP) modifications under multianvil high-pressure (7.5 - 11.5 GPa) high-temperature (1100 - 1200 °C) conditions. The structures of NP-CeNiSn, HPPrNiSn, NP-NdNiSn, HP-LaPdSn, HP-PrPdSn, and HP-NdPdSn were refined from single crystal X-ray diffractometer data. Structural data for HP-SmNiSn were obtained from a Rietveld powder refinement. The high-pressure phase transition significantly changes the rare earth coordination, i. e. 4 RE + 6 Ni(Pd) + 6 Sn atoms for the NP-phases and 6 RE + 5 Ni(Pd) + 6 Sn atoms for the HPphases. Susceptibility measurements of HP-PrPdSn and HP-NdPdSn reveal paramagnetic behavior with experimental magnetic moments of 3.61(1) μB/Pr atom and 3.66(1) μB/Nd atom, respectively. Low-temperature susceptibility and specific heat data point to inhomogeneous magnetism and spinglass behavior, respectively.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3amagnetism 3anickel 3aphase transition 3aspecific heat 3atin 0aIntermetallics 0aHigh Pressure 0aMagnetism 0aCrystal Chemistry1 aHeymann, Gunter1 aHermes, Wilfried1 aRodewald, Ute Ch.1 aHoffmann, Rolf-Dieter1 aHuppertz, Hubert1 aPöttgen, Rainer,0 tZeitschrift für Naturforschung.g2014 June 2, v. 63, no. 6 p.695-706dVerlag der Zeitschrift für NaturforschungwJournal:23182x0932-07767nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1515/znb-2008-06163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02391naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002200149245010200171520133600273592002801609650002601637650001601663650002001679650001501699650001601714650001101730650001701741651001001758700002101768700001901789700001801808773013401826856008401960852000902044655001202053IND60757557720221120172706.0211125e20211117xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075755772DNAL7 a10.3390/agriculture111111522doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChung, Yiu-Kwong,10aResearch on Government Subsidy Strategies for the Development of Agricultural Products E-Commerce  aIn many countries, the governments support the development of local agriculture through subsidization. Subsidizing the sales of agricultural products through E-commerce channels is a way to support the development of agriculture in China. This study aims to develop a profit model and apply Stackelberg game theory to determine which type of subsidies and decision-making can provide the maximum benefits for agricultural products E-commerce supply chains. The results indicate that for both centralized decisions and decentralized decisions, the subsidizing to the agricultural cooperative is better than the subsidizing to consumers and no subsidization. The sales volume, preservation level, sales efforts, and overall profit of the agricultural products E-commerce supply chain are significantly higher. It suggests that the government should play a leading role to support the development of agricultural products E-commerce. This study contributes to agricultural research by developing a profit model to examine the effects of different government subsidy strategies on each member of the agricultural online shopping supply chain. Recommendations are provided for agricultural cooperatives, E-commerce platforms, and the government to improve the quality and sales of agricultural products through online shopping channels.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural research 3aagriculture 3adecision making 3ae-commerce 3agame theory 3amodels 3asupply chain 3aChina1 aLai, Ivan Ka Wai1 aGuo, Fangfang 1 aTang, Huajun 0 tAgriculture (Basel).g2021 Nov. 17, v. 11, no. 11dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:12387x2077-04727nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agriculture111111523Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02874naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002300094024002200117024001900139040001800158100002000176245012900196300001500325520150100340592002801841650001401869650001601883650000901899650001401908650002801922650001201950650001501962650001501977650001901992650001602011700001802027700002202045700002702067773015202094856007002246856010402316990002302420852000902443655001202452IND60608575420221119155238.0190510e20171024xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060857542DNAL7 a10.3791/560342doi7 aPMC57552202pmcid7 a291557002pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKubsch, Bastian10aPhase behavior of charged vesicles under symmetric and asymmetric solution conditions monitored with fluorescence microscopy  ap. e56034.  aPhase-separated giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs) exhibiting coexisting liquid-ordered and liquid-disordered domains are a common biophysical tool to investigate the lipid raft hypothesis. Numerous studies, however, neglect the impact of physiological solution conditions. On that account, the current work presents the effect of high-salinity buffer and trans-membrane solution asymmetry on liquid-liquid phase separation in charged GUVs grown from dioleylphosphatidylglycerol, egg sphingomyelin, and cholesterol. The effects were studied under isothermal and varying temperature conditions. We describe equipment and experimental strategies applicable for monitoring the stability of coexisting liquid domains in charged vesicles under symmetric and asymmetric high-salinity solution conditions. This includes an approach to prepare charged multicomponent GUVs in high-salinity buffer at high temperatures. The protocol entails the option to perform a partial exchange of the external solution by a simple dilution step while minimizing the vesicle dilution. An alternative approach is presented utilizing a microfluidic device that allows for a complete external solution exchange. The solution effects on phase separation were also studied under varying temperatures. To this end, we present the basic design and utility of an in-house built temperature control chamber. Furthermore, we reflect on the assessment of the GUV phase state, pitfalls associated with it and how to circumvent them.  aPublisher supplied data 3aasymmetry 3acholesterol 3aeggs 3aequipment 3afluorescence microscopy 3aliquids 3amonitoring 3aseparation 3asphingomyelins 3atemperature1 aRobinson, Tom1 aSteinkühler, Jan1 aDimova, Rumi︠a︡na,0 tJournal of visualized experiments.g2017 Oct. 24, , no. 128 p.e56034-e56034dJournal of Visualized ExperimentswJournal:jnl4469330x1940-087X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3791/560343Available from publisher's site  uhttp://www.jove.com/video/56034/phase-behavior-charged-vesicles-under-symmetric-asymmetric-solution  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle01919naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002300143245011100166300001600277520077800293592002801071650002401099650001201123650001201135650002201147650001301169650001101182650001401193653001801207653002201225653001501247653001101262653001501273700002101288773015001309856007701459852000901536655001201545IND60522336120221119144240.0160602e20140602xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052233612DNAL7 a10.1515/znb-2008-06172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKnyrim, Johanna S.10aHigh-pressure Synthesis, Crystal Structure, and Properties of the First Ternary Zirconium Borate β-ZrB2O5  ap. 707-712.  aThe high-pressure phase β -ZrB₂O₅ represents the first ternary borate in the system Zr-B-O.

The crystal structure was determined on the basis of single crystal X-ray diffraction data, collected at room temperature. The monoclinic zirconium borate crystallizes in the space group P2₁/c with the lattice parameters a = 439.04(9), b = 691.2(2), c = 896.8(2) pm, and β = 90.96(3)°. The structure is isotypic to the high-pressure phase β -HfB₂O₅, which is built up from layers of exclusively corner-sharing BO₄ tetrahedra.

This study was conducted using an in situ rhizobox approach and incubation experiments, with the primary goal to elucidate rhizosphere effects of different poplar clones at different sampling seasons on soil microbial processes and biomass content. Evaluations included pH, inorganic N (NO3−-N and NH4+-N), microbial biomass carbon (MBC) and nitrogen (MBN), enzyme activities related to N cycling, as well as net N mineralization and nitrification rates in rhizosphere soils of three poplar clones (Nanlin-895, NL-80351 and 75) at three periods of the year. The magnitude of rhizosphere effects varied with time and poplar genotypes. Significant variations in microbial biomass content and enzyme activities were observed among the tested three poplar clones; and microbial biomass content was positively correlated with soil NO3−-N concentration. The obtained results suggested that genotypes (clones or cultivars) had profound impacts on the rhizosphere microbial communities; and NO3−-N concentration rather than total inorganic N was the primary determinant of seasonal dynamics of microbial biomass and processes in the rhizosphere soils of poplar trees in a seasonally flooded soil.  aPublisher supplied data 3aammonium nitrogen 3acarbon 3aclones 3acorrelation 3acultivars 3aenzyme activity 3agenotype 3amicrobial activity 3amicrobial biomass 3amicrobial communities 3amineralization 3anitrification 3anitrogen 3apH 3aplantations 3arhizosphere 3asoil 3atrees 0aEnzyme activity 0aMicrobial biomass 0aNitrogen mineralization 0aPoplar clone 0aRhizobox 0aRhizosphere effect1 aFang, Shengzuo1 aTian, Ye1 aDun, Xinjian0 tApplied soil ecology.g2014 June, v. 78 p.65-72dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl55717x0929-13937nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apsoil.2014.02.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02273naa a2200469 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002400075024005000099040001800149100001900167245008600186300001600272500000900288500001500297520087900312592002801191650001801219650001301237650001701250650002001267650001501287650001701302650002101319650002201340650001301362650002101375650001501396650002701411650001301438650001501451650001101466650001501477653001701492700001801509700002101527700001601548773012101564852000901685856009701694655001201791991582085760742620221120060843.0191122e197105  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aCAIN7191436912DNAL7 a10.2134/agronj1971.00021962006300030038x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMathers, A.

The experiment was performed with both level border and graded furrow irrigation to determine the effect of deep tillage on yield of sugarbeets (Beta vulgaris L. variety ‘HH-10’). Sugarbeet yields were increased by deep tillage and added N with adequate irrigation, but there was no yield increase from applied P. Deep tillage increased yields more where N was applied. Also, the response to N was greater after deep tillage to 40 cm in two of three years. Deep tillage increased the water intake rate, thus favoring good root development during wet seasons. Higher sugar yield after deep tillage was attributed to increased water intake, improved aeration, reduced bulk density, less root rot, and increased response to N.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBeta vulgaris 3aaeration 3abulk density 3aclay loam soils 3acrop yield 3adeep tillage 3afertilizer rates 3afurrow irrigation 3anitrogen 3anutrient content 3aphosphorus 3aphosphorus fertilizers 3aroot rot 3asugar beet 3asugars 3awet season 0asoil science1 aWilson, G.

The new sampler is made of Teflon chips packed in a nylon net, and tied on a rod like a branch in the canopy. The validity and characteristics of the new sampler were checked by comparing it with the conventional bucket sampler and the foliar extraction method using hinoki (Chamaecyparis obtusa) trees. The comparison between the deposited amounts on the dummy branch and those on the bucket indicates that the dummy could trap gaseous matter more effective than the bucket. From a comparison with the foliar extracting method, it is concluded that the trapping of particulate matter by the new dummy branch is comparable to that of natural needle leaves. However, its efficiency for gaseous matter is relatively small. This disadvantage should be improved by applying other materials to the dummy. Moreover, it is found that the uptake of gas especially SO₂ through the stomata is an important point in the discussion about dry deposition. To evaluate the amounts of dry deposition in the forest canopy more precisely, combination with the additional method should be useful.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChamaecyparis obtusa 3adry deposition 3aforest canopy 3aforests 3anylon 3aparticulates 3apolytetrafluoroethylene 3aresearch 0aacidic deposition 0abranch 0ahinoki 0asampler1 aKo, Win Ko0 tJournal of forest research.g1998 Feb. 1, v. 3, no. 1 p.19-24dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl3870061x1610-74037nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF027602883Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02999naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001300147245016500160300001600325520169100341592002802032650001502060650002502075650001402100650001702114650002202131650002202153650001002175650002002185650001302205650001402218650001402232650001002246650000702256650001402263700001202277700001402289700001902303700001502322773010302337856008102440990002302521852000902544655001202553IND60093164220221117234214.0141103e20120915xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009316422DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cej.2012.07.0762doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMena, E.10aOn ozone-photocatalysis synergism in black-light induced reactions: Oxidizing species production in photocatalytic ozonation versus heterogeneous photocatalysis  ap. 131-140.  aThe synergism produced between ozone and TiO₂ black light photocatalytic oxidation of methanol has been studied following the rate of formaldehyde formation during photocatalytic oxidation, ozonation and photocatalytic ozonation experiments. Methanol was selected as a model compound due to its low reaction rate with molecular ozone and its scavenging character for both, free hydroxyl radicals and trapped holes. TiO₂-P25 was used as photocatalyst and black light blue lamps (emitting with a maximum at 365nm) as radiation source. The effect of ozone concentration and pH was evaluated. Absorbed light intensity by the photocatalyst was also determined to calculate the quantum yields of photocatalytic reactions. Three main processes need to be considered during photocatalytic ozonation: direct ozone-methanol reaction, indirect ozone reactions and photocatalytic reactions, which allow calculating the quantum yield of photo-generated oxidizing species. The presence of ozone exerts a positive effect in the reaction rate of oxidizing species formation due to light induced reactions also enhancing the quantum yield from 0.34 to 0.80moleinstein⁻¹ at pH=3 (where indirect ozone reactions are negligible). This parameter increased from 0.29 to 3.27moleinstein⁻¹ at pH=7 likely due to indirect ozone reactions that cannot be disregarded. The positive effect of ozone in the photocatalytic induced reactions has been attributed to the reaction of dissolved ozone and hydrogen peroxide (formed upon methanol direct ozonation) as electron acceptors, thus reducing the recombination process on the catalyst surface to some extent. A simplified economic study is also presented.  aPublisher supplied data 3ablue light 3achemical engineering 3aeconomics 3aformaldehyde 3ahydrogen peroxide 3ahydroxyl radicals 3alamps 3alight intensity 3amethanol 3aoxidation 3aozonation 3aozone 3apH 3asynergism1 aRey, A.1 aAcedo, B.1 aBeltrán, F.J.1 aMalato, S.0 tChemical engineering journal.g2012 Sept. 15, v. 204-206 p.131-140dElsevier B.V.x1385-89477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cej.2012.07.0763Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03952naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245012800167300001600295520268600311592002802997650001503025650001103040650002603051650001103077650001403088650002703102650002003129650001103149653002203160653001703182653002003199653002603219653002203245700002303267700002103290700002303311700002203334773008103356856008403437852000903521655001203530IND60546770220221117230123.0160903e201512  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054677022DNAL7 a10.1016/j.wasman.2015.09.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLaner, David10aResource recovery from residual household waste: An application of exergy flow analysis and exergetic life cycle assessment  ap. 653-667.  aExergy is based on the Second Law of thermodynamics and can be used to express physical and chemical potential and provides a unified measure for resource accounting. In this study, exergy analysis was applied to four residual household waste management scenarios with focus on the achieved resource recovery efficiencies. The calculated exergy efficiencies were used to compare the scenarios and to evaluate the applicability of exergy-based measures for expressing resource quality and for optimizing resource recovery. Exergy efficiencies were determined based on two approaches: (i) exergy flow analysis of the waste treatment system under investigation and (ii) exergetic life cycle assessment (LCA) using the Cumulative Exergy Extraction from the Natural Environment (CEENE) as a method for resource accounting. Scenario efficiencies of around 17–27% were found based on the exergy flow analysis (higher efficiencies were associated with high levels of material recycling), while the scenario efficiencies based on the exergetic LCA lay in a narrow range around 14%. Metal recovery was beneficial in both types of analyses, but had more influence on the overall efficiency in the exergetic LCA approach, as avoided burdens associated with primary metal production were much more important than the exergy content of the recovered metals. On the other hand, plastic recovery was highly beneficial in the exergy flow analysis, but rather insignificant in exergetic LCA. The two approaches thereby offered different quantitative results as well as conclusions regarding material recovery. With respect to resource quality, the main challenge for the exergy flow analysis is the use of exergy content and exergy losses as a proxy for resource quality and resource losses, as exergy content is not per se correlated with the functionality of a material. In addition, the definition of appropriate waste system boundaries is critical for the exergy efficiencies derived from the flow analysis, as it is constrained by limited information available about the composition of flows in the system as well as about secondary production processes and their interaction with primary or traditional production chains. In the exergetic LCA, resource quality could be reflected by the savings achieved by product substitution and the consideration of the waste’s upstream burden allowed for an evaluation of the waste’s resource potential. For a comprehensive assessment of resource efficiency in waste LCA, the sensitivity of accounting for product substitution should be carefully analyzed and cumulative exergy consumption measures should be complimented by other impact categories.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaccounting 3aexergy 3alife cycle assessment 3ametals 3arecycling 3asecondary productivity 3awaste treatment 3awastes 0aExergy accounting 0aExergy flows 0aWaste treatment 0aMunicipal solid waste 0aResource recovery1 aRechberger, Helmut1 aDe Soete, Wouter1 aDe Meester, Steven1 aAstrup, Thomas F.0 tWaste management.g2015 Dec., v. 46 p.653-667dElsevier Ltdx0956-053X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2015.09.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03195naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094024002200124024001900146040001800165100006100183245007300244506007600317520162500393592002802018506003702046650002702083650002802110650002602138650003202164650001202196650001902208650001802227650001902245650001002264650001302274650001302287650001302300650002902313650001802342650001502360650001502375650001002390650001102400650001402411700004702425700002902472773010302501856007602604852000902680655001202689IND60637798520221207064155.0190424e20190410xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063779852DNAL7 a10.1155/2019/49732142doi7 aPMC64811582pmcid7 a310934912pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEvanovich, Eliane1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7076-562110aComparative Genomic Analysis of Lactobacillus plantarum: An Overview  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBackground. Lactobacillus plantarum is widely used in the manufacture of dairy products, fermented foods, and bacteriocins. The genomes of the strains contain multiple genes which may have been acquired by horizontal gene transfer. Many of these genes are important for the regulation, metabolism, and transport of various sugars; however, other genes may carry and spread virulence and antibiotic resistance determinants. In this way, monitoring these genomes is essential to the manufacture of food. In this study, we aim to provide an overview of the genomic properties of L. plantarum based on approaches of comparative genomics. Results. The finding of the current study indicates that the core genome of L. plantarum presents 1425 protein-coding genes and is mostly related to the metabolic process. The accessory genome has on average 1320 genes that encodes protein involved in processes as the formation of bacteriocins, degradation of halogen, arsenic detoxification, and nisin resistance. Most of the strains show an ancestral synteny, similar to the one described in the genomes of L. pentosus KCA1 and L. plantarum WCFS1. The lifestyle island analyses did not show a pattern of arrangement or gene content according to habitat. Conclusions. Our results suggest that there is a high rate of transfer of genetic material between the strains. We did not identify any virulence factors and antibiotic resistance genes on the genomes. Thus, the strains may be useful for the biotechnology, bioremediation, and production of bacteriocins. The potential applications are, however, restricted to particular strains.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aLactobacillus pentosus 3aLactobacillus plantarum 3aantibiotic resistance 3aantibiotic resistance genes 3aarsenic 3abioremediation 3abiotechnology 3adairy products 3afoods 3agenomics 3ahabitats 3ahalogens 3ahorizontal gene transfer 3amanufacturing 3ametabolism 3amonitoring 3anisin 3asugars 3avirulence1 ade Souza Mendonça Mattos, Patricia Jeanne1 aGuerreiro, João Farias,0 tInternational Journal of Genomics.g2019 Apr. 10, v. 2019dHindawiwJournal:26808x2314-43787nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2019/49732143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02764naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100002800142245007400170300001600244520141800260592002801678650001501706650002001721650002101741650002001762650001501782650002801797650001701825650001201842650001901854650001301873650001501886650001001901651002201911651001301933651001001946653002501956653002201981653002102003653001802024700002802042700002502070773011202095856007802207852000902285655001202294IND50065225520221120200026.0151031e200804  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006522552DNAL7 a10.3170/2008-7-183482doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGarzóón, Marta Benito10aEffects of climate change on the distribution of Iberian tree species  ap. 169-178.  aQuestion: Will the predicted climate changes affect species distribution in the Iberian Peninsula?Location: Iberian Peninsula (Spain and Portugal).Methods: We modelled current and future tree distributions as a function of climate, using a computational framework that made use of one machine learning technique, the random forest (RF) algorithm. This algorithm provided good predictions of the current distribution of each species, as shown by the area under the corresponding receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curves. Species turnover, richness and the change in distributions over time to 2080 under four Intergovernmental panel on climate change (IPCC) scenarios were calculated using the species map outputs.Results and Conclusions: The results show a notable reduction in the potential distribution of the studied species under all the IPCC scenarios, particularly so for mountain conifer species such as Pinus sylvestris, P. uncinata and Abies alba. Temperate species, especially Fagus sylvatica and Quercus petraea, were also predicted to suffer a reduction in their range; also submediterranean species, especially Q. pyrenaica, were predicted to undergo notable decline. In contrast, typically Mediterranean species appeared to be generally more capable of migration, and are therefore likely to be less affected.Nomenclature:Amaral Franco (1990), Govaerts & Avishai (2002) for Quercus pubescens.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAbies alba 3aFagus sylvatica 3aPinus sylvestris 3aQuercus petraea 3aalgorithms 3aartificial intelligence 3abiogeography 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3aconifers 3aprediction 3atrees 3aIberian Peninsula 3aPortugal 3aSpain 0aForest distributions 0aIberian Peninsula 0aMachine learning 0aRandom forest1 ade Dios, Rut Sáánchez1 aOllero, Helios Sainz0 tApplied vegetation science.g2008 Apr., v. 11, no. 2 p.169-178dIAVS; Opulus Press Uppsalax1402-20017nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3170%2F2008-7-183483Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02189naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002200143245010100165300001600266520098600282592002801268650001801296650001901314650001301333650001301346650001601359653002701375653001301402653001901415653000801434653001201442700001901454700002001473700002601493700001501519700002101534773015001555856007701705852000901782655001201791IND60522336520221119144307.0160602e20140602xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052233652DNAL7 a10.1515/znb-2008-06212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGoglio, Graziella10aSolvothermal Processes for Nitride Synthesis: Examples of Li3GaN2 and Graphitic C3N4 Elaboration  ap. 730-738.  aWhen precursors decompose or react in the presence of a solvent in a closed system at a temperature higher than the solvent’s boiling point the reaction is called a solvothermal process. This reaction can be carried out either in supercritical or subcritical conditions, in homogeneous or heterogeneous systems, pressure and temperature being both key parameters. As the main interest of such processes is the enhancement of chemical reactivity, solvothermal reactions have been widely involved for nitride elaboration. We report two examples relative to solvothermal syntheses of nitrides. The first one deals with the elaboration of Li₃GaN₂: this ionic nitride has been successfully synthesized, structurally characterized and tested as nutrient for the ammonothermal GaN crystal growth. The second one is related to the elaboration of a well-crystallized graphitic carbon nitride (g-C₃N₄) aimed to be developed as a precursor for conversion towards dense CNₓ phases.  aPublisher supplied data 3aboiling point 3acarbon nitride 3agraphene 3asolvents 3atemperature 0aSolvothermal Synthesis 0aNitrides 0aCarbon Nitride 0aGaN 0aLi3GaN21 aDenis, Annaïg1 aGaudin, Etienne1 aLabrugère, Christine1 aFoy, Denis1 aLargeteau, Alain0 tZeitschrift für Naturforschung.g2014 June 2, v. 63, no. 6 p.730-738dVerlag der Zeitschrift für NaturforschungwJournal:23182x0932-07767nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1515/znb-2008-06213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02378naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100003500149245010900184520110000293592002801393650001301421650002901434650001401463650001601477650001101493650002001504650001001524650001201534650001801546650001001564650001301574650001201587650001001599651001101609700002001620700001601640700002101656700001801677700002201695773013401717856008401851852000901935655001201944IND60757558320221123032312.0211125e20211118xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075755832DNAL7 a10.3390/agriculture111111582doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMuñoz-Adalia, Emigdio Jordán10aEvaluation of Chestnut Susceptibility to Cryphonectria parasitica: Screening under Controlled Conditions  aCryphonectria parasitica (Murrill) M.E. Barr (Sordariomycetes, Valsaceae) is the causal agent of chestnut blight. This disease is a major concern for chestnut cultivation in Europe. The fungus colonizes vascular tissues and evolves generating cankers causing severe dieback and the death of the tree. Excised and debarked well-lignified shoots of 28 C. sativa genotypes (assay A) and of 10 progenies (assay B) were inoculated with C. parasitica strain FMT3bc2 (vcg: EU2). Fungal growth was measured along the longitudinal axis on the 3rd and 6th days after inoculation. Results indicated the inoculation methodology works and the results were clear after 6 days. Differences in susceptibility to chestnut blight among C. sativa trees of Montseny have been detected both at the individual genotype level and at the progeny level.

The shortage of good information on the distribution of alien species and their spatial dynamics is largely attributable to the cost, effort and expertise required to monitor these species over large areas. Virtual globes, particularly Google Earth, are free and user-friendly software which provide high-resolution aerial imagery for the entire globe. We suggest this has enormous potential for invasion science. We provide suggestions and tools for gathering data on the distribution and abundance of invasive alien trees using visual interpretation of Google Earth imagery, and propose how these data may be used for a number of purposes, including calculating useful metrics of invasions, prioritising species or areas for management and predicting potential distributions of species. We also suggest various practical uses of Google Earth, such as providing a tool for early detection of emerging invasions, monitoring invasions over time, and to help researchers and managers identify suitable field study sites. Virtual globes such as Google Earth are not without limitations and we provide guidance on how some of these can be overcome, or when imagery from Google Earth may not be fit for invasion science purposes. Because of Google Earth’s huge popularity and ease of use, we also highlight possibilities for awareness-raising and information sharing that it provides. Finally, we provide the foundations and guidelines for a virtual global network of sentinel sites for early detection, monitoring and data gathering of invasive alien trees, which we propose should be developed as part of a “citizen science” effort. There has been limited use of virtual globes by invasion scientists and managers; it is our hope that this paper will stimulate their greater use, both within the field of invasion science and within ecology generally.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiogeography 3acomputer software 3aecology 3aguidelines 3aimage analysis 3aintroduced species 3ainvasive species 3amanagers 3aresearchers 3ascientists 3atrees1 aLangdon, Barbara1 aPauchard, Aníbal,1 aRichardson, David M.0 tBiological invasions.g2014 Mar., v. 16, no. 3 p.513-534dSpringer-Verlagx1387-35477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10530-013-0604-y  aDNAL 7aarticle02430naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001900143245009600162500001900258520127900277592002801556650000801584650002301592650000901615650001501624650001301639650001501652650001001667650001601677650001901693650001801712700002001730700002001750700001901770700001801789700002001807773011901827856007701946852000902023655001202032IND60735115920221120185838.0210423e20210402xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073511592DNAL7 a10.3390/foods100407622doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKim, Se-Myung 10aQuality Characteristics of Semi-Dried Restructured Jerky Processed Using Super-Heated Steam  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aMoisture content and water activity play important roles in extending the shelf life of dried meat products, such as jerky. However, the commonly used hot air drying process is time-consuming, costly, and adversely affects the quality of dried meat products, warranting the development of an advanced and economical drying method. This study investigated the effect of super-heated steam (SHS) drying on the quality characteristics of semi-dried restructured jerky as a measure to prevent the excessive quality deterioration of meat products during drying. The control sample was dried using hot air, and the treatment samples were dried using SHS at different temperatures (200, 250, and 300 °C) and for different durations (90, 105, and 120 min). With increasing SHS temperature and duration, the moisture content, water activity, and residual nitrite content of the jerky were reduced. The shear force values for treatments at 200 and 250 °C were lower than those for the control. With a non-significant difference in lipid oxidation compared with the control, the overall acceptability score was the highest for the treatment at 250 °C for 120 min. In conclusion, SHS (250 °C for 120 min) drying has a potential industrial value to replace the hot air drying method.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3alipid peroxidation 3ameat 3ameat jerky 3anitrites 3ashelf life 3asteam 3atemperature 3awater activity 3awater content1 aKim, Tae-Kyung 1 aKim, Hyun-Wook 1 aJung, Samooel 1 aYong, Hae  In1 aChoi, Yun-Sang 0 tFoods.g2021 Apr. 02, v. 10, no. 4dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21651x2304-81587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/foods100407623Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03021naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001600150245005100166300001300217520154700230592002801777650001701805650001101822650002301833650001901856650002001875650001301895650001601908650001701924650001501941650001201956650001101968650001201979650001801991650001302009650001402022650001302036650001402049650001302063650001502076653001302091653001102104653002802115653002702143700001702170700001602187700003402203700006202237773008702299856008402386852000902470655001202479IND60623611520221122225413.0181127e201812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062361152DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biochi.2018.03.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCouto, Nuno10aExosomes as emerging players in cancer biology  ap. 2-10.  aOncologic diseases do not behave as isolated entities. Instead, they are based on complex systemic networks involving cell-cell communication between cancerous and healthy cells of the host, which may either facilitate or prevent cancer progression. In addition to cell-cell contacts, cells communicate through secreted factors in a process modulated by ligand concentration, receptor availability and synergy amongst several signaling circuits. Of these secreted factors, exosomes, 30–150 nm membrane vesicles of endocytic origin released by virtually all cells, have emerged as important cell-cell communication players both in physiological and pathological scenarios by being carriers of all the main biomolecules, including lipids, proteins, DNAs, messenger RNAs and microRNA, and performing intercellular transfer of components, locally and systemically. By acting both in tumor and non-tumor cells, such as fibroblasts, leukocytes, endothelial and progenitor cells, tumor- and non-tumor cells-derived exosomes can modulate tumor growth and invasion, tumor-associated angiogenesis, tissue inflammation and the immune system. In this Review, we summarize the main findings of the literature on the roles of exosomes in mediating interactions between tumor and tumor-associated cells. We also discuss how the molecular composition analysis of circulating exosomes in clinical settings has emerged as an attractive non-invasive source of liquid biopsies for early diagnosis, prognosis and follow-up of patients with oncologic diseases.  aPublisher supplied data 3aangiogenesis 3abiopsy 3acell communication 3adisease course 3aearly diagnosis 3aexosomes 3afibroblasts 3ainflammation 3aleukocytes 3aligands 3alipids 3aliquids 3amessenger RNA 3amicroRNA 3aneoplasms 3apatients 3aprognosis 3aproteins 3astem cells 0aExosomes 0aCancer 0aCell-cell communication 0aTumor microenvironment1 aCaja, Sergio1 aMaia, Joana1 aStrano Moraes, Maria Carolina1 aCosta-Silva, Bruno1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5932-62110 tBiochimie.g2018 Dec., v. 155 p.2-10dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6254x0300-90847nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biochi.2018.03.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02293naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001900149245011400168300001800282520138500300592002801685650002501713650002201738650001801760650001101778650002501789651001101814773008601825856008301911852000901994655001202003IND60096758120221120145322.0141104e201105  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009675812DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enpol.2011.01.0242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Yue-Jun10aInterpreting the dynamic nexus between energy consumption and economic growth: Empirical evidence from Russia  ap. 2265-2272.  aResearch on the nexus between energy consumption and economic growth is a fundamental topic for energy policy making and low-carbon economic development. Russia proves the third largest energy consumption country in the world in recent years, while little research has shed light upon its energy consumption issue till now, especially its energy–growth nexus. Therefore, this paper empirically investigates the dynamic nexus of the two variables in Russia based on the state space model. The results indicate that, first of all, Russia's energy consumption is cointegrated with its economic growth in a time-varying way though they do not have static or average cointegration relationship. Hence it is unsuitable to merely portrait the nexus in an average manner. Second, ever since the year of 2000, Russia's energy efficiency has achieved much more promotion compared with that in previous decades, mainly due to the industrial structure adjustment and technology progress. Third, among BRIC countries, the consistency of Russia's energy consumption and economic growth appears the worst, which suggests the complexity of energy–growth nexus in Russia. Finally, there exists bi-directional causality between Russia's energy consumption and economic growth, though their quantitative proportional relation does not have solid foundation according to the cointegration theory.  aPublisher supplied data 3aeconomic development 3aenergy efficiency 3aenergy policy 3amodels 3atime series analysis 3aRussia0 tEnergy policy.g2011 May, v. 39, no. 5 p.2265-2272dElsevier Ltdx0301-42157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enpol.2011.01.0243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02211naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094024002200127024001900149040001800168100001900186245005600205300001800261506007600279520089300355592002801248506003701276650001901313650003501332650001801367650001501385650001301400650001601413650002401429650001301453700001801466700001901484700002401503700001901527700002701546773012801573856007901701852000901780655001201789IND60302109920221207073259.0150704e20130913xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6030210992DNAL7 a10.1126/science.12411442doi7 aPMC39703252pmcid7 a240310122pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKlein, Florian10aAntibodies in HIV-1 Vaccine Development and Therapy  ap. 1199-1204.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aDespite 30 years of study, there is no HIV-1 vaccine and, until recently, there was little hope for a protective immunization. Renewed optimism in this area of research comes in part from the results of a recent vaccine trial and the use of single-cell antibody-cloning techniques that uncovered naturally arising, broad and potent HIV-1–neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs). These antibodies can protect against infection and suppress established HIV-1 infection in animal models. The finding that these antibodies develop in a fraction of infected individuals supports the idea that new approaches to vaccination might be developed by adapting the natural immune strategies or by structure-based immunogen design. Moreover, the success of passive immunotherapy in small-animal models suggests that bNAbs may become a valuable addition to the armamentarium of drugs that work against HIV-1.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aHIV infections 3aHuman immunodeficiency virus 1 3aanimal models 3aantibodies 3aantigens 3avaccination 3avaccine development 3avaccines1 aMouquet, Hugo1 aDosenovic, Pia1 aScheid, Johannes F.1 aScharf, Louise1 aNussenzweig, Michel C.0 tScience.g2013 Sept. 13, v. 341, no. 6151 p.1199-1204dAmerican Association for the Advancement of Sciencex0036-80757nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.12411443Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02574naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002600147245014200173300001600315520143600331592002801767650000901795650001001804650001401814650003701828650002101865650002301886650002601909650001601935650000901951650001001960700002401970700002701994700002702021773009502048856004802143852000902191655001202200IND50072391920221119103222.0140129e201403  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007239192DNAL7 a10.1007/s10530-013-0607-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZenni, Rafael Dudeque10aAdaptive evolution and phenotypic plasticity during naturalization and spread of invasive species: implications for tree invasion biology  ap. 635-644.  aAlthough the genetic aspects of biological invasions are receiving more attention in the scientific literature, analyses of phenotypic plasticity and genotype-by-environment interactions are still seldom considered in tree invasion biology. Previous studies have shown that invasions of tree species can be affected by intraspecific phenotypic plasticity, pre-adaptation, and post-introduction evolution, and we suggest there are opportunities for new developments in this field. Here, we present a description of the use of quantitative and molecular genetics in tree invasion biology, and propose an approach based on common garden experiments, quantitative and molecular genetic methods to investigate the role of adaptive evolution, phenotypic plasticity, and genotype-by-environment interactions in tree invasions, particularly at the infraspecific level. We illustrate the utility of this approach using examples from quantitative genetic studies of Pinus and an example from a classical reciprocal common garden experiment with Acer species. By using this approach, researchers can test hypotheses about the role and strength of genetic and environmental effects on population-level invasiveness and gain insights into evolutionary processes that occur during biological invasions. Moreover, knowledge of phenotypic plasticity and local adaption of tree populations may help researchers improve assessments of invasion risk.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAcer 3aPinus 3aevolution 3agenotype-environment interaction 3ainvasive species 3amolecular genetics 3aphenotypic plasticity 3aresearchers 3arisk 3atrees1 aLamy, Jean-Baptiste1 aLamarque, Laurent Jean1 aPorté, Annabel Josée0 tBiological invasions.g2014 Mar., v. 16, no. 3 p.635-644dSpringer-Verlagx1387-35477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10530-013-0607-8  aDNAL 7aarticle01815naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100001600112245014200128300001600270500001900286520073400305592002801039650001501067650002801082650002101110650001301131650002001144650000701164650000901171650001501180650001601195653002301211653002201234700002101256700001801277773014901295852000901444655001201453IND60721401120221122062234.0201224e198512  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072140112DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPande, N.C.10aEffect of Submergence on Changes in Soil Properties and Yield and Nutrient Uptake by Rice with Varying Nutrio-environment in Lowland Soil  ap. 816-820.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aChanges in available nutrient and pH in submerged rice soil were studied under field condition with varying nutrio-environment. There was decrease in availability of NH₄-N, Ca, Mg, Mn, Cu and Zn and a slight increase in available Fe due to continuous absorption by rice crop. Response to application of nitrogen only was noticed. Nutrient uptake followed the trend of dry matter production which, in turn, was influenced by rate of nitrogen application. Application of nitrogen influenced the availability of NH₄-N in soil, whereas P and K had no effect on nutrient dynamics. Changes in pH was best fitted to exponential function; NH₄-N, K, Ca, Zn and Cu to quadratic function and P, Mg, Fe, and Mn to logarithmic function.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3adry matter accumulation 3afertilizer rates 3anitrogen 3anutrient uptake 3apH 3arice 3arice soils 3asubmergence 0anutrio-environment 0alowland rice soil1 aSamantaray, R.N.1 aMohanty, S.K.0 tJournal of the Indian Society of Soil Science.g1985 Dec., v. 33, no. 4 p.816-820dIndian Society of Soil SciencewJournal:1945x0974-02287nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle03173naa a2200661 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002500150245009800175300001600273520135600289592002801645650002101673650001001694650002501704650001201729650001601741650002101757650001101778650001701789650000901806650001601815650001501831650001101846650001401857650001801871650001501889650001101904650001401915650000901929650001401938650001001952650001601962650001401978650001101992650001102003650002702014650000802041650001602049650002102065650002102086653001802107653003202125653001402157653000902171653006102180700001602241700001302257700001402270700001602284773010502300856008502405852000902490655001202499IND60597462420221120084957.0200210e201802  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059746242DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apsoil.2018.01.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVittori Antisari, L.10aEngineered nanoparticles effects in soil-plant system: Basil (Ocimum basilicum L.) study case  ap. 551-560.  aThe aim of this study was to examine the effects of selected metal (Ag, Co, Ni) and metal oxide (CeO₂, Fe₃O₄, SnO₂, TiO₂) engineered nanoparticles on basil (Ocimum basilicum L.). Seedlings, grown in soil mixture (20% sandy soil, 80% peat), were exposed to nanoparticles once per week, for 4 weeks with solutions at 100 μg mL⁻¹ of nanoparticle component metal, to simulate a chronic exposure to NPs supplied with irrigation. At the end of the experiment (4 weeks), (i) morphological and physiological parameters of basil (e.g. dry weight, gaseous exchange), (ii) nanoparticle component metal taken up by the basil plant (namely, Ag, Ce, Co, Fe, Ni, Sn and Ti) and (iii) the content of nutrients (Ca, Mg, K, Na, P and S) in different basil organs were evaluated. The results indicated that the nanoparticle component metal was mainly accumulated in the basil roots. However, despite the capability of plant to exclude potentially toxic elements, Ag, CeO₂, Co and Ni NPs component metal translocate from the root to the shoot reaching the leaves, the edible part of the plant. Notably, also in the relative short exposure there was an accumulation of Ca in roots, suggesting that the modification of metabolic pathway in plants could be aimed at counteracting the membrane damage generated directly or indirectly by nanoparticles.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOcimum basilicum 3abasil 3abiochemical pathways 3acalcium 3aceric oxide 3achronic exposure 3acobalt 3agas exchange 3airon 3airon oxides 3airrigation 3aleaves 3amagnesium 3ananoparticles 3ananosilver 3anickel 3anutrients 3apeat 3apotassium 3aroots 3asandy soils 3aseedlings 3asilver 3asodium 3asodium dodecyl sulfate 3atin 3atin dioxide 3atitanium dioxide 3atoxic substances 0aNanoparticles 0aBasil (Ocimum basilicum L.) 0aPollution 0aSoil 0aInductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectrometry1 aCarbone, S.1 aBosi, S.1 aGatti, A.1 aDinelli, G.0 tApplied soil ecology.g2018 Feb., v. 123 p.551-560dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl55717x0929-13937nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apsoil.2018.01.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03549naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002200149245012300171300001400294520195500308592002802263650001302291650001102304650001902315650001402334650001502348650002102363650001402384650001802398650001102416650001602427650001202443650003502455650001602490650002102506650001302527650001502540650001702555650001602572650002202588650000902610650001602619650002102635650001502656651002102671651001002692653001902702653002102721653002102742653002602763773010202789856008302891852000902974655001202983IND60599614220221120115825.0180702e201409  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059961422DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cageo.2014.04.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRawat, Pradeep K.10aGIS development to monitor climate change and its geohydrological consequences on non-monsoon crop pattern in Himalaya  ap. 80-95.  aThe main objective of the study was to assess climate change and its geohydrological impacts on non-monsoon crop pattern at watershed level through GIS development on climate informatics, land use informatics, hydro-informatics and agro-informatics. The Dabka watershed constitutes a part of the Kosi Basin in densely populated Lesser Himalaya, India in district Nainital has been selected for the case illustration. This reconnaissance study analyzed the climatic database for last three decades (1982–2012) and estimates that the average temperature and evaporation loss have been rising with the rate of 0.07°C/yr and 4.03mm/yr respectively whereas the average rainfall has been decreasing with the rate of 0.60mm/yr. These rates of climate change increasing with mounting elevations. Consequently the existing microclimatic zones (sub-tropical, temperate and moist temperate) shifting towards higher altitudes and affecting the favorable conditions of the land use pattern and decreased the eco-friendly forest and vegetation cover. The land use degradation and high rate of deforestation (0.22km² or 1.5%/yr) leads to accelerate several hydrological problems during non-monsoon period (i.e. decreasing infiltration capacity of land surface, declining underground water level, drying up natural perennial springs and streams, decreasing irrigation water availability etc.). In order to that the non-monsoon crops yield has been decreasing with the rate of 0.60% each year as the results suggest that the average crop yield is just about 58q/ha whereas twenty five to thirty year back it was recorded about 66q/ha which is about 12% higher (8q/ha) than existing yield. On the other hand the population increasing with the growth rate of 2% each year. Therefore, decreasing crop yield and increasing population raised food deficiency problem and the people adopting other occupations which ultimately affecting rural livelihood of the Himalaya.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaltitude 3abasins 3aclimate change 3acomputers 3acrop yield 3acropping systems 3adatabases 3adeforestation 3adrying 3aevaporation 3aforests 3ageographic information systems 3agroundwater 3airrigation water 3aland use 3alivelihood 3amicroclimate 3aoccupations 3apopulation growth 3arain 3atemperature 3avegetation cover 3awatersheds 3aHimalayan region 3aIndia 0aClimate change 0aLand degradation 0aWater deficiency 0aDecreasing crop yield0 tComputers & geosciences.g2014 Sept., v. 70 p.80-95dElsevier LtdwJournal:12438x0098-30047nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cageo.2014.04.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03345naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002100143245014000164500001900304520180400323592002802127650001802155650003002173650001902203650001902222650001602241650001802257650001202275650001702287650001302304650001802317650001002335650001602345650001502361650001802376650001302394650002802407650001702435700002602452700002602478700002502504700002102529700002802550700003002578700002602608773011902634856007702753852000902830655001202839IND60735116320221120185842.0210423e20210403xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073511632DNAL7 a10.3390/foods100407652doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDourou, Dimitra 10aMicrobiota of Chicken Breast and Thigh Fillets Stored under Different Refrigeration Temperatures Assessed by Next-Generation Sequencing  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aChicken is one of the most widely consumed meats worldwide. The exploration of the bacterial diversity of chicken meat may provide new insights into the chicken-associated microbiome that will lead to moderation of food spoilage or safety. This study was undertaken to explore the bacterial communities of chicken breast and thigh fillets stored at refrigeration (0 °C and 5 °C) and slightly abuse (10 °C) temperatures for 5 days through conventional cultural methods along with next-generation sequencing (NGS) analysis. Total viable counts (TVC), Brochothrix thermosphacta, Pseudomonas spp., and lactic acid bacteria (LAB) were enumerated, while the bacterial communities were mapped through 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing. Chicken breast and thigh fillets possessed a complex bacterial structure that incorporated a total of >200 Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs) at the genus level. The core microbiota of fresh samples consisted of Acinetobacter, Brochothrix, Flavobacterium, Pseudomonas, Psychrobacter, and Vibrionaceae (family). These genera persisted until the end of storage in >80% of samples, except Psychrobacter and Flavobacterium, while Photobacterium was also identified. Hierarchical clustering showed a distinction of samples based on storage time and chicken part. Conventional plate counting with growth media commonly used in spoilage studies did not always correspond to the microbial community profiles derived from NGS analysis, especially in Pseudomonas, Acinetobacter, Photobacterium, and Vibrionaceae. Results of the present study highlight Photobacterium and Vibrionaceae, in general, as potent chicken meat spoilers and suggest the necessity to combine classical microbiological methods along with NGS technologies to characterize chicken meat spoilage microbiota.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAcinetobacter 3aBrochothrix thermosphacta 3aFlavobacterium 3aPhotobacterium 3aPseudomonas 3aPsychrobacter 3abreasts 3achicken meat 3achickens 3afood spoilage 3agenes 3alactic acid 3amicrobiome 3arefrigeration 3aspoilage 3aspoilage microorganisms 3astorage time1 aSpyrelli, Evgenia  D.1 aDoulgeraki, Agapi  I.1 aArgyri, Anthoula  A.1 aGrounta, Athena 1 aNychas, George-John  E.1 aChorianopoulos, Nikos  G.1 aTassou, Chrysoula  C.0 tFoods.g2021 Apr. 03, v. 10, no. 4dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21651x2304-81587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/foods100407653Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02255naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100005700153245009600210300002000306500001900326520105500345592002801400650002001428650001201448650001101460650001501471650001901486650001001505700001601515700001701531700002101548700005401569700005201623773012201675856008701797852000901884655001201893IND60718102120221121214140.0201119e20201030xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071810212DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.energyfuels.0c029002doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Yuming1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1852-197712aA Review on Biomass Gasification: Effect of Main Parameters on Char Generation and Reaction  ap. 13438-13455.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aReactions between char and gasifying agents are usually the controlling step and of a core role for the overall biomass gasification process due to the relatively low reaction rate. Char reactivity will be greatly affected via interacting with volatiles, such as steam, hydrocarbons, tarry compounds, and other light gas species. By taking the updraft/downdraft moving bed and fluidized bed gasifier as examples, this review discussed the effects of char generation and evolution in various reactor environments on its following reaction behaviors. The characteristics of biomass and subsequent char gasification are further examined in terms of feedstock types and their inherent inorganics. Then, the effects of operation conditions and gasifying reagents on biomass gasification are outlined mainly from the point of char production and the subsequent volatiles–char interaction. Finally, some directions and suggestions considering char conversion and utilization are addressed for the design and betterment of the biomass gasification process.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiogasification 3abiomass 3aenergy 3afeedstocks 3afluidized beds 3asteam1 aWan, Lifeng1 aGuan, Juntao1 aXiong, Qing’an1 aZhang, Shu1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4137-07481 aJin, Xin1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4168-58890 tEnergy & fuels.g2020 Oct. 30, v. 34, no. 11 p.13438-13455dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23338x1520-50297nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.energyfuels.0c029003Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01561naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002900149245007800178300001800256520062700274592002800901650001500929650001100944650002900955650002100984650001201005650002901017651001001046651001301056773008601069856008301155852000901238655001201247IND60096758720221120160008.0141104e201105  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009675872DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enpol.2011.02.0462doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBorgford-Parnell, Nathan10aSynergies of scale: A vision of Mongolia and China's common energy future  ap. 2764-2771.  aEnergy consumption in China is expected to double over the next 20 years.

The dechlorination rate of cis-DCE increased with pH, which was attributed to changes in the solid-phase Fe concentration, the composition of Fe minerals, and the surface speciation of Fe minerals. With increasing pH, larger quantities of Fe minerals, having much greater reactivity than dissolved Fe(II), were produced. Fe–K edge X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) analysis of Fe precipitates revealed the presence of multiple Fe phases with their composition varying with pH. Correlation analyses were performed to examine how the solid-phase Fe concentration, the composition of Fe minerals, and their surface speciation were linked with the cis-DCE dechlorination rate. Such analyses revealed that neither mackinawite (FeS) nor magnetite (Fe3O4) was reactive with cis-DCE dechlorination, but that Fe (oxyhydr)oxides including green rusts and Fe(OH)2 were reactive. Based on a proposed model of the surface acidity of Fe minerals, the increasing deprotonated surface Fe(II) groups with pH correlated well with the enhanced cis-DCE dechlorination.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacidity 3aabsorption 3airon 3amodels 3apH 3adechlorination 3amagnetite 3aspectroscopy 3aX-radiation 2aChemical Precipitation 2aDichloroethylenesxchemistry 2aEnvironment 2aHalogenation 2aHydrogen-Ion Concentration 2aIronxchemistry 2aKinetics 2aLeast-Squares Analysis 2aLinear Models 2aOxidation-Reduction 2aX-Ray Absorption Spectroscopy 0acis-DCE 0aMagnetite 0aMackinawite 0airon oxides 0aGreen rust 0aReductive dechlorination 0aEXAFS 0aoxides1 aAnantharaman, Karthik1 aHyun, Sung P.1 aSon, Moon1 aHayes, Kim F.0 tWater research.g2013 Nov. 01, v. 47 p.6639-6649dElsevier Ltdx0043-13547nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.watres.2013.08.0353Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03299naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002500143245018100168500001900349520172300368592002802091650002302119650002802142650002502170650001402195650001902209650001202228650002202240650001002262650001602272650002402288650001202312650002302324650001502347650001502362650001702377650001102394650001202405700002802417700002102445700002602466700002002492700002502512700002902537700002202566773011902588856007702707852000902784655001202793IND60735116620221123014157.0210423e20210403xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073511662DNAL7 a10.3390/foods100407682doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBontsidis, Christos 10aMicrobiological and Chemical Properties of Chokeberry Juice Fermented by Novel Lactic Acid Bacteria with Potential Probiotic Properties during Fermentation at 4 °C for 4 Weeks  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aOn the frame of this research survey, a novel potentially probiotic strain (Lactobacillus paracasei SP5) recently isolated from kefir grains was evaluated for chokeberry juice fermentation. Chokeberry juice was retrieved from the variety Aronia melanocarpa, a plant known to provide small, dark berries and to be one of the richest sources of antioxidants. The juice was subsequently fermented inoculating L. paracasei SP5 for 48 h at 30 °C. The fermented juices were left at 4 °C and tested regarding microbiological and physicochemical characteristics for 4 weeks. The potentially probiotic strain was proved capable of performing lactic acid fermentation at 30 °C. Cell viability of L. paracasei was detected in high levels during fermentation and the whole storage period, while the fermented juice showed higher levels of viability in juice with 40.3 g/L of initial sugar concentration. No ethanol was detected in the final fermented juice. Fermented chokeberry juice was characterized by aromatic desirable volatiles, which were retained in adequate levels for the whole storage period. Specifically, the occurrence of organic esters detected in fermented juices is considered as positive evidence of the provision of fruity and floral notes to the final product. During storage, total phenolics content and antioxidant activity were observed in higher levels in fermented chokeberry juice compared with non-fermented juice. Subsequently, fermentation of chokeberry juice by potentially probiotic lactic acid bacteria could provide high industrialization potential, providing the market with a nutritional beverage of good volatile quality with an enhanced shelf-life compared with an unfermented fresh juice.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAronia melanocarpa 3aLactobacillus paracasei 3aantioxidant activity 3abeverages 3acell viability 3aethanol 3aindustrialization 3akefir 3alactic acid 3alactic fermentation 3amarkets 3aphenolic compounds 3aprobiotics 3ashelf life 3astorage time 3asugars 3asurveys1 aMallouchos, Athanasios 1 aTerpou, Antonia 1 aNikolaou, Anastasios 1 aBatra, Georgia 1 aMantzourani, Ioanna 1 aAlexopoulos, Athanasios 1 aPlessas, Stavros 0 tFoods.g2021 Apr. 03, v. 10, no. 4dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21651x2304-81587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/foods100407683Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02123naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094024002200130024001900152040001800171100001800189245007100207300001400278500001100292506007600303520074300379592002801122596006701150596008601217506003701303650002001340650001801360650002001378650001001398650001301408650001401421650001501435700006401450773012001514856008201634852000901716655001201725IND60683336820221207143408.0200207e202003  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068333682DNAL7 a10.1007/s12088-019-00842-w2doi7 aPMC70006132pmcid7 a320895732pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLee, Jung-Kul10aMapping Microbial Capacities for Bioremediation: Genes to Genomics  ap. 45-53.  aReview  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBioremediation is a process wherein the decontamination strategies are designed so that a site could achieve the environmental abiotic and biotic parameters close to its baseline. In the process, the driving force is the available microbial genetic degradative capabilities, which are supported by required nutrients so that the desired expression of these capabilities could be exploited in favour of removal of pollutants. With genomics tools not only the available abilities could be estimated but their dynamic performance could also be established. These tools are now playing important role in bioprocess optimization, which not only derive the bio-stimulation plans but also could suggest possible genetic bio-augmentation options.  aPublisher supplied data  aNRF-2019H1D3A2A01060226cNational Research Foundation of Korea  a2013M3A6A8073184cMinistry of Science, ICT and Future Planning, Republic of Korea0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abioaugmentation 3abioprocessing 3adecontamination 3agenes 3agenomics 3anutrients 3apollutants1 aKalia, Vipin Chandra1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7892-26010 tIndian journal of microbiology.g2020 Mar., v. 60, no. 1 p.45-53dSpringer IndiawJournal:jnl14369x0046-89917nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12088-019-00842-w3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02756naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002000092024003000112040001800142100002000160245007200180300001200252520123100264592002801495650002301523650001101546650001601557650001601573650002501589650002201614650002001636650001601656650000901672650002901681650002201710650002401732650002601756651001001782653002501792653003001817653004001847700002101887700002101908700002201929773010001951856011102051856007802162961001302240852000902253655001202262IND4377677020221122230457.0151127e200601  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437767702DNAL7 a10113/19052hdl7 a10.1614/WS-05-042R.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMahan, James R.10aThermal dependence of bioengineered glufosinate tolerance in cotton  ap. 1-5.  aTolerance to glufosinate has been bioengineered into cotton through the expression of a gene encoding the enzyme phosphinothricin acetyl transferase (PAT). Studies were conducted to determine thermal limitations on herbicide efficacy in bioengineered cotton. The 50%% inhibition (I₅₀) of glufosinate of the target-site enzyme glutamine synthetase was thermally dependent with the lowest values between 25 and 35 C. Larger values of I₅₀ were measured above and below the 25 to 35 C range. The apparent Michaelis constant KM of the enzyme PAT was relatively stable from 15 to 30 C and increased more rapidly from 30 to 45 C. The two components in combination suggest the aggregate tolerance to glufosinate would not be thermally limited between 15 and 45 C. The thermal dependence of the aggregate tolerance in cotton suggests that glufosinate would not damage the crop over a range of temperatures. This prediction is in agreement with the results of field studies carried out over a number of years, which showed the glufosinate-tolerant cotton to be undamaged by glufosinate over a wide range of temperatures.Nomenclature: Glufosinate; cotton, Gossypium hirsutum L. ‘‘SeedCo 9023’’, ‘‘DeltaPine 458’’.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGossypium hirsutum 3acotton 3afiber crops 3aglufosinate 3aherbicide resistance 3atransgenic plants 3aair temperature 3aheat stress 3aheat 3aglutamate-ammonia ligase 3aenzyme inhibitors 3aambient temperature 3afield experimentation 3aTexas 0aGlutamine synthetase 0aMichaelis-Menten constant 0aphosphinothricin acetyl transferase1 aDotray, Peter A.1 aLight, Ginger G.1 aDawson, Kristy R.0 tWeed science.g2006 Jan., v. 54, no. 1 p.1-5dWeed Science Society of America]x0043-17457nnas40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/19053Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1614%2FWS-05-042R.13Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/ARS  aDNAL 7aarticle02566naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002400150245007000174300001400244520116000258592002801418650000801446650000801454650001501462650001801477650001101495650001801506650001301524650001001537650001101547650001201558650001701570650001801587650001001605650001901615650001801634650001401652650002101666650001201687653002901699653001701728653002701745653002701772653002601799700001701825700002401842773008801866856008501954852000902039655001202048IND60623612120221122212737.0190131e201902  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062361212DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biochi.2018.11.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJeevanandam, Jaison10aVirus-like nanoparticles as a novel delivery tool in gene therapy  ap. 38-47.  aViruses are considered as natural nanomaterials as they are in the size range of 20–500 nm with a genetical material either DNA or RNA, which is surrounded by a protein coat capsid.

Attention is given to the utilization of viruses as nanomaterials for medical, biotechnology and energy applications. Removal of genetic material from the viral capsid creates empty capsid for drug incorporation and coating the capsid protein crystals with antibodies, enzymes or aptamers will enhance their targeted drug deliver efficiency. Studies reported that these virus-like nanoparticles have been used in delivering drugs for cancer. It is also used in imaging and sensory applications for various diseases. However, there is reservation among researchers to utilize virus-like nanoparticles in targeted delivery of genes in gene therapy, as there is a possibility of using virus-like nanoparticles for targeted gene delivery.

There are four strategies that permit plants to become invasive without being limited by a lack of mutualists. One is to not be dependent on mutualists. The other three strategies are to form novel mutualisms, form associations with cosmopolitan species, or co-invade with mutualists from their native range. Historically there has been a bias to study mutualisms from a plant perspective, with little consideration of soil biota as invasive species in their own right. Here we address this by reviewing the literature on belowground invasive mutualists of woody plants. We focus on woody invaders as ecosystem-transforming plants that frequently have a high dependence on belowground mutualists. We found that co-invasions are common, with many ectomycorrhizal plant species and N-fixing species co-invading with their mutualists. Other groups, such as arbuscular mycorrhizal plants, tend to associate with cosmopolitan fungal species or to form novel associations in their exotic range. Only limited evidence exists of direct negative effects of co-invading mutualists on native mutualist communities, and effects on native plants appear to be largely driven by altered environmental conditions rather than direct interactions. Mutualists that introduce novel ecosystem functions have effects greater than would be predicted based solely on their biomass. Focusing on the belowground aspects of plant invasions provides novel insights into the impacts, processes and management of invasions of both soil organisms and woody plant species.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiomass 3aecosystems 3aectomycorrhizae 3aenvironmental factors 3afungi 3aindigenous species 3ainvasive species 3asoil 3avesicular arbuscular mycorrhizae 3awoody plants1 aDickie, Ian A.0 tBiological invasions.g2014 Mar., v. 16, no. 3 p.645-661dSpringer-Verlagx1387-35477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10530-013-0612-y  aDNAL 7aarticle02350naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001400143245009700157500001900254520132300273592002801596650000801624650001901632650001901651650001401670650003301684650001601717700001701733700001401750700001501764700002801779773011901807856007701926852000902003655001202012IND60735116820221120135258.0210423e20210403xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073511682DNAL7 a10.3390/foods100407692doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHu, Lina 10aStudy on the Rehydration Quality Improvement of shiitake Mushroom by Combined Drying Methods  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe aim of study is to improve the rehydration quality of dried shiitake mushrooms for their instant food manufacturers and fast restaurants. Serial combined drying methods were investigated to achieve this objective: either instant controlled pressure drop drying (DIC) or freeze drying (FD) was used as the treatments for microstructure improvement, and they were applied either before or after an additional drying step at low (35 °C) or high (65 °C) temperatures. Dried mushrooms were assessed for quality indicators like relative volume, rehydration rate, dry matter loss and sensory scores. Microstructure properties were inferred to understand the physical mechanisms of quality changes. Principal component analysis (PCA) was used to cluster treatments and to identify combinations of drying techniques, rendering improved quality. Consequently, it was shown that DIC treatment before hot air drying at 35 °C was shown to be the most promising combined drying method to enhance the rehydration quality, leading to a high volume recovery ratio, low dry matter loss after rehydration, and high rehydration rates. This good performance could be explained by the retention of pore interconnectivity resulting from the slight expansion of porous structure during DIC and the retention of cell membrane integrity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3acell membranes 3amicrostructure 3amushrooms 3aprincipal component analysis 3arehydration1 aBi, Jinfeng 1 aJin, Xin 1 aQiu, Yang 1 aSman, R.

Multiple factors such as Ca²⁺ play important roles in different stages of this process. Because of the complicated roles of Ca²⁺ in adipogenesis, the aim of present investigation was to study the influx and efflux of Ca²⁺ into and out of the cells during adipogenesis. Adipose-derived MSCs were used to differentiate into adipocytes. MSCs were exposed to 2.5 mM Ca²⁺ or 1.8 mM Ca²⁺ plus calcium ionophore, A23187, for 3 days. Lipid staining, triglycerides (TG) content, and glyceraldehyde phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) activity were evaluated to confirm the efficiency of the differentiation. Gene expression of GLUT4, PPARγ2, RAR-α, and calreticulin, as well as the protein levels of GLUT4 and PPARγ2 were determined. Ca²⁺ and in particular Ca²⁺ plus A23187 significantly lowered the efficiency of differentiation accompanied by decrease in intracellular TG deposits, GAPDH activity and alleviation of gene, and protein levels of GLUT4 and PPARγ2. While calreticulin and RAR-α were remarkably upregulated in A23187 group. This study showed the inhibitory effects of calcium in adipogenesis. Additionally, it indicated the greater inhibitory effect of calreticulin and RAR-α in controlling adipogenesis by higher levels of calcium.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadipocytes 3aadipogenesis 3aaldehyde oxidoreductases 3acalcium 3acalcium ionophores 3acalreticulin 3agenes 3aglucose transporters 3ahumans 3aobesity 3astaining 3astem cells 3atriacylglycerols1 aMohammadalipour, Adel1 aKhodadadi, Iraj1 aKarimi, Sheno1 aMostoli, Rezvan1 aBahabadi, Majid1 aGoodarzi, MohammadTaghi0 tMolecular biotechnology.g2018 Apr., v. 60, no. 4 p.279-289dSpringer USwJournal:jnl52132x1073-60857nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12033-018-0071-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02796naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002300147245008700170300001600257520170300273592002801976650001402004650001702018650002002035650002402055650001502079650002302094650002102117650001202138650001002150650001702160651001202177700002502189700002302214773009502237856008102332852000902413655001202422IND50072392520221119055529.0150212e201403  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007239252DNAL7 a10.1007/s10530-013-0613-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPotgieter, Luke J.10aCasuarina: biogeography and ecology of an important tree genus in a changing world  ap. 609-633.  aImportant insights on the invasion ecology of woody plants are emerging from the study of model groups, but it is important to test how widely such results can be generalised. We examined whether drivers of introduction and invasion in the genus Casuarina are similar to those identified for other groups. We reviewed the literature, mapped current global distributions, and modelled the potential global distribution of the genus. We assessed the rationale behind introductions, impacts of invasions, and the evolution of management approaches. Casuarinas have been introduced to about 150 countries. Ten of the 14 species in the genus have been introduced outside their native ranges, but only three species are recorded as naturalized or invasive (C. equisetifolia, C. cunninghamiana and C. glauca). Species with large native ranges are more likely to be introduced, and the three invasive species have the largest native ranges and the most records of introduction. There were no clear relationships between life-history traits (e.g. seed mass, plant height, or resprouting ability) and the extent of invasion. About 8 % of the Earth’s land surface is potentially suitable for casuarinas and large-scale plantings in some climatically suitable areas have not yet resulted in large-scale invasions; there is a substantial global Casuarina invasion debt. Experiences in Florida and the Mascarene Islands highlight that casuarinas have the potential to transform ecosystems with significant control costs. The challenge is to develop management approaches that minimise the impacts of invasions while preserving economic, environmental and cultural values of species in their introduced ranges.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCasuarina 3abiogeography 3acultural values 3aecological invasion 3aecosystems 3aintroduced species 3ainvasive species 3aislands 3atrees 3awoody plants 3aFlorida1 aRichardson, David M.1 aWilson, John R.

The soil characteristics of pre-delineated cropped and barren portions within the same field were studied at different locations after the harvest of barley. The infiltration rate was comparatively much lower at the barren patches, which occupied relatively higher elevations and the surface soil appeared to be more compact as indicated by the bulk density values. The salt concentration, both at the time of seeding and harvest of the crop also remained much higher at barren sites. It appeared that a differential teaching of salts during rainy season, because of wide variation in infiltration characteristics and differential resalinisation during dry periods due to differences in soil moisture content and elevation were primarily related to the occurrence and perpetuation of barren patches in cultivated saline fields. Field levelling and delineating low and high infiltration zo>es by earthen dikes so that rain or irrigation water can be impounded separately, is likely to ensure greater uniformity in leaching of salts and consequently the crop growth.  aPublisher supplied data 3abarley 3abulk density 3ainfiltration rate 3airrigation water 3arain 3asalt concentration 3asoil water content 3awet season 3aIndia 0aSaline fields 0abarren patches 0ainfiltration 0aleaching 0aresalinisation1 aKhosla, B K.0 tJournal of the Indian Society of Soil Science.g1985 Dec., v. 33, no. 4 p.870-875dIndian Society of Soil SciencewJournal:1945x0974-02287nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle03308naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100005300153245013500206300002000341500001900361520182900380592002802209650001302237650002602250650001102276650001102287650001902298650000902317650002002326650001102346650003202357650001302389650001402402650001202416650002002428650001402448651001002462700001602472700001602488700005602504700001502560700001602575700001702591773012202608856008702730852000902817655001202826IND60718102520221121214131.0201119e20201016xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071810252DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.energyfuels.0c029262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBao, Yuan1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6848-743110aGas Origin and Constraint of δ¹³C(CH₄) Distribution in the Dafosi Mine Field in the Southern Margin of the Ordos Basin, China  ap. 14065-14073.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aCoalbed gas or coalbed methane (CBM) is a vital hydrocarbon gas which is mainly absorbed in the surface of the coal matrix and has multiple benefits as in being effective in development and utilization. To determine the gas origin, the distribution of the stable carbon isotopic composition for methane, and its constraint in the Middle Jurassic strata in the Dafosi mine area in the southern margin of the Ordos Basin, nine CBM samples were collected from pumping wells at the surface, arranged along three profiles located in different tectonic areas. The gas components and stable isotope compositions were measured, and the results show that the average methane and carbon dioxide concentrations in the coal seams measured are 77.44 and 1.04 mol %, respectively. CBM has apparent dry gas characteristics, with more than 6835 distributed C₁/(C₂ + C₃) ratio values. The average values of the carbon and hydrogen isotopic compositions of CBM are −79.2‰ and −241.9‰, respectively. The gas origin in the Dafosi mine field is mainly composed of biogenic gas from CO₂ reduction and mixed thermogenic gas. The former content accumulated in the present coal seams ranges from 68.93% to 100.00%, as calculated by the binary mixing model. A web-based learning tool also indicates mostly CO₂ reduction-biogenic gas. Fold types play an essential role in controlling the distribution of different genetic CBM with different stable carbon isotope ratios. Biogenic gas with low carbon isotopic composition lies in the southern parts of the Qijia anticline blocked by the footwall of the fault. The mixed CBM comprised of biogenic and thermogenic gases with high carbon isotopic composition is distributed in the areas of Anhua and Shijiadian synclines sealed with lithology and hydrocarbon concentration, respectively.  aPublisher supplied data 3aInternet 3aMiddle Jurassic epoch 3abasins 3acarbon 3acarbon dioxide 3acoal 3acoalbed methane 3aenergy 3agas production (biological) 3ahydrogen 3alithology 3amethane 3astable isotopes 3atectonics 3aChina1 aWang, Wenbo1 aMa, Dongmin1 aShi, Qingmin1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4486-87711 aAli, Azmat1 aLv, Dingkun1 aZhang, Canke0 tEnergy & fuels.g2020 Oct. 16, v. 34, no. 11 p.14065-14073dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23338x1520-50297nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.energyfuels.0c029263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03045naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245007500169300001600244520155000260592002801810650001101838650002801849650001201877650001001889650001301899650001201912650002201924650002501946650001201971650001201983650001501995650002502010650001202035650001102047650001502058650001202073650002302085650001302108650001702121650001102138650002602149650001902175650001502194650000902209650001602218650001002234650001302244650001402257700001902271700002502290773009502315856004802410852000902458655001202467IND50072392620221119055416.0140129e201403  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007239262DNAL7 a10.1007/s10530-013-0614-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRundel, Philip W.10aTree invasions into treeless areas: mechanisms and ecosystem processes  ap. 663-675.  aNon-native tree invasions occur not only in woodland or forest vegetation, but also into areas with little or no native tree presence. Limiting factors for tree establishment and survival include seasonal or annual drought, low nutrient availability, cold temperature extremes, fire, and other abiotic conditions to which trees are poorly adapted as well as biotic conditions such as herbivory and lack of soil mutualist inoculum. Tree invasions of grasslands and semi-arid riparian areas in particular are now widespread and frequently result in the rapid conversion of these habitats to woodlands or forests. In some cases, these invasions are the result of a change in extrinsic conditions such as climate, fire, and/or grazing that remove what have been previous barriers to tree establishment. However, in other cases, tree species with particular life-history and dispersal traits fill open niches or outcompete native species. Significant examples of tree invasion into treeless areas can be seen with invasions of Pinus species into temperate grasslands and fynbos shrublands, Melaleuca quinquenervia and Triadica sebifera into grassy wetlands, Prosopis and Tamarix species into semi-arid riparian zones, and Acacia and Morella invasions into nutrient-poor shrublands and barrens. The establishment of trees into treeless areas may have strong impacts on ecosystem processes, influencing biogeochemical cycling, carbon sequestration and cycling, and ecohydrology, as well possible edaphic legacies that persist even if trees are removed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAcacia 3aMelaleuca quinquenervia 3aMorella 3aPinus 3aProsopis 3aTamarix 3aTriadica sebifera 3acarbon sequestration 3aclimate 3adrought 3aecosystems 3aenvironmental impact 3aforests 3afynbos 3agrasslands 3agrazing 3aindigenous species 3ainoculum 3alife history 3aniches 3anutrient availability 3ariparian areas 3ashrublands 3asoil 3atemperature 3atrees 3awetlands 3awoodlands1 aDickie, Ian A.1 aRichardson, David M.0 tBiological invasions.g2014 Mar., v. 16, no. 3 p.663-675dSpringer-Verlagx1387-35477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10530-013-0614-9  aDNAL 7aarticle03077naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001700143245011300160500001900273520139900292592002801691650002801719650002501747650002701772650001601799650003201815650002501847650001601872650001101888650001601899650001001915650001201925650002201937650001301959650002601972650002501998650002102023650001602044700001902060700001802079700001802097700001602115700001602131700001602147700001902163700002002182700001902202700002002221700001702241700001902258700001702277773011902294856007702413852000902490655001202499IND60735117020221120135408.0210423e20210404xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073511702DNAL7 a10.3390/foods100407722doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKim, DoYeon,10aLactobacillus fermentum SMFM2017-NK4 Isolated from Kimchi Can Prevent Obesity by Inhibiting Fat Accumulation  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThis study evaluated the anti-obesity effects of lactic acid bacteria. Thirty-one lactic acid bacteria were examined in vitro for their ability to inhibit α-glucosidase activity, lipase activity, and 3T3-L1 cell differentiation. Four selected lactic acid bacteria were administered to obese C57BL/6J mice models for 8 weeks. The degree of improvement in obesity was determined by weight gain and serum biochemical analysis. The expression levels of genes (Fas and Cpt-2) related to obesity in the liver were analyzed by quantitative reverse transcription (qRT)-PCR. In addition, antioxidant protein levels (SOD-2, CAT, and GPx-1) in the liver were evaluated. The lactic acid bacteria-treated groups (PPGK1, LFNK3, LPNK2, and LFNK4) showed lower weight increase rate than the control group. The total cholesterol (T-chol), triglyceride (TG), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels in the blood serum of the LFNK4 group were the lowest among other groups, compared to the control group. The expression levels of lipid metabolism-related genes (Fas and Cpt-2) in the liver of the LFNK4 group were lower in Fas and higher in Cpt-2 than in the control group. The antioxidant protein expression levels (SOD-2, CAT, and GPx-1) in the liver tissue were also higher in the LFNK4 group. These results indicate that L. fermentum SMFM2017-NK4 has anti-obesity effects.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLactobacillus fermentum 3aalanine transaminase 3aaspartate transaminase 3ablood serum 3acarboxylic ester hydrolases 3acell differentiation 3acholesterol 3akimchi 3alactic acid 3aliver 3aobesity 3aprotein synthesis 3aproteins 3areverse transcription 3asuperoxide dismutase 3atriacylglycerols 3aweight gain1 aChoi, Yukyung 1 aKim, Sejeong 1 aHa, Jimyeong 1 aOh, Hyemin 1 aLee, Yewon 1 aKim, Yujin 1 aSeo, Yeongeun 1 aPark, Eunyoung 1 aKang, Joohyun 1 aYoo, Yoonjeong 1 aLee, Soomin 1 aLee, Heeyoung 1 aYoon, Yohan 0 tFoods.g2021 Apr. 04, v. 10, no. 4dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21651x2304-81587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/foods100407723Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02198naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001500149245010300164300001400267520118600281592002801467650001501495650001401510650001501524650001201539653001401551653002301565653002201588653002301610653001401633700001901647773010201666856008301768852000901851655001201860IND60599615120221122060125.0180702e201409  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059961512DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cageo.2014.05.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDi, Haibin12aA new algorithm for evaluating 3D curvature and curvature gradient for improved fracture detection  ap. 15-25.  aIn 3D seismic interpretation, both curvature and curvature gradient are useful seismic attributes for structure characterization and fault detection in the subsurface. However, the existing algorithms are computationally intensive and limited by the lateral resolution for steeply-dipping formations. This study presents new and robust volume-based algorithms that evaluate both curvature and curvature gradient attributes more accurately and effectively. The algorithms first instantaneously fit a local surface to seismic data and then compute attributes using the spatial derivatives of the built surface. Specifically, the curvature algorithm constructs a quadratic surface by using a rectangle 9-node grid cell, whereas the curvature gradient algorithm builds a cubic surface by using a diamond 13-node grid cell. A dip-steering approach based on 3D complex seismic trace analysis is implemented to enhance the accuracy of surface construction and to reduce computational time. Applications to two 3D seismic surveys demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency of the new curvature and curvature gradient algorithms for characterizing faults and fractures in fractured reservoirs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3acomputers 3ageophysics 3asurveys 0aCurvature 0aCurvature gradient 0aSeismic attribute 0aFracture detection 0aAlgorithm1 aGao, Dengliang0 tComputers & geosciences.g2014 Sept., v. 70 p.15-25dElsevier LtdwJournal:12438x0098-30047nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cageo.2014.05.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01483naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100001500112245007600127300001600203500002900219520044700248592002800695650001500723650001000738650001900748650001300767650001600780650001800796650001200814650001000826650002700836650001600863650001500879650001600894653002000910700002100930773014900951852000901100655001201109IND60721402220221122000731.0201224e198512  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072140222DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGarg, V.K.10aEvaluation of Techniques Suitable for Growing Sugar Beet on Sodic Soils  ap. 884-887.  aNALT-AP-4-rerunAP2-fuzzy  aTwo methods of establishing sugar beet on sodic soils Were evaluated.

Eighty volatile components including alcohols, aldehydes, acids, ketones, esters, alkanes, nitrogen-containing components, aromatic components and terpenes were identified by headspace sampling and gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC–MS) method during storage. Among these volatile components, the relative content of trimethylamine was the highest during storage, which increased from 11.36±1.02% at day 0 to 14.60±0.58% at day 28. Values of total volatile base nitrogen (TVB-N), trimethylamine (TMA), thiobarturic acid reactive substances (TBARS), total viable mesophilic count (TVC) and sensory characteristics of colour and odour for dried A. chinensis changed significantly during storage. Volatile components, TVB-N, TMA, pH, TBARS, TVC, colour and odour characteristics at different storage time were statistically interpreted by principle component analysis (PCA) method in order to found the main indices for the freshness of dried A. chinensis. The results suggested that colour, TMA, TVB-N, TBARS, odour, TVC and some volatile components could reflect the quality changes perfectly.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacids 3aalcohols 3aaldehydes 3aalkanes 3acolor 3adried foods 3aesters 3afood storage 3afreshness 3agas chromatography 3aketones 3amass spectrometry 3amicrobiological quality 3anitrogen 3aodors 3aplate count 3ashrimp 3astorage quality 3astorage time 3aterpenoids 3athiobarbituric acid-reactive substances 3atrimethylamine1 aZhang, Jian-You1 aLiu, Shu-Lai1 aWang, Yan1 aDing, Yu-Ting0 tFood chemistry.g2011 July 1, v. 127, no. 1 p.159-168dElsevier Ltdx0308-81467nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2010.12.1203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02700naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100005700151245014000208500001900348520131400367592002801681650002201709650002101731650001101752650003701763650001501800650000901815653002901824653002201853653002601875653002001901700001401921700001501935700001801950700001401968700005501982700001702037700001602054773011302070856008602183852000902269655001202278IND60717356320221120205754.0210226e20210505xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071735632DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhazmat.2020.1245042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhu, Jianping1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2411-550X10aRevealing the substitution preference of zinc in ordinary Portland cement clinker phases: A study from experiments and DFT calculations  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aOrdinary Portland cement (OPC) clinker mainly consist four minerals, tricalcium silicate (C₃S), dicalcium silicate (C₂S,), tricalcium aluminate (C₃A), and tetracalcium aluminoferrite (C₄AF). To learn the doping behaviors of Zn in OPC clinker, a series of samples were prepared by calcinating the mixtures of CaCO₃, SiO₂, Al₂O₃, Fe₂O₃, and ZnO. Our results from energy-dispersive spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction and density functional theoretical simulations show that a small amount of ZnO enter C₃S and C₂S by replacing Ca ions while most incorporate into C₄AF by substituting Fe atoms, resulting in a decrease of C₃A in OPC as dosage increases. Further analyses from partial density of states and distributions of bond order-bond length indicate that the doping preference can be ascribed to the similar electron contributions and small structure distortions between host and guest ions. Unlike the strong Fe‒O bond, the newly formed Zn‒O is much weaker. The weak Zn‒O may be responsible for the limited solubility of Zn in C₄AF. These results provide a possibility of increasing solubility of Zn in OPC clinker by increasing the contents of C₃A and C₄AF, thus will be very meaningful in the synthesis of OPC clinker by utilizing Zn-bearing alternative raw materials.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3acalcium silicate 3acement 3aenergy-dispersive X-ray analysis 3asolubility 3azinc 0aOrdinary Portland cement 0aZinc substitution 0aElectronic structures 0aDFT calculation1 aYang, Kuo1 aChen, Yang1 aFan, Guangxin1 aZhang, Li1 aGuo, Benkai1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8261-31551 aGuan, Xuemao1 aZhao, Ruiqi0 tJournal of hazardous materials.g2021 May 05, v. 409 p.124504-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6200x0304-38947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2020.1245043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02881naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001200150245012600162520139600288592002801684650002301712650003201735650003101767650001101798650002201809650001101831650002001842653003301862653002901895653002201924653002201946653002101968653002601989700001802015700001902033700005602052700005702108700001702165700001402182700005502196773009002251856008502341852000902426655001202435IND60770810920221119140033.0220628e20220715xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077081092DNAL7 a10.1016/j.energy.2022.1237742doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWu, Yue10aHierarchical predictive control for electric vehicles with hybrid energy storage system under vehicle-following scenarios  aFor electric vehicles with hybrid energy storage system, driving economy depends not only on novel energy management strategies but also on load power demand. In order to optimize the power demand and energy management simultaneously, this paper proposes a hierarchical model predictive control framework for electric vehicles with a Li-ion battery/supercapacitor hybrid energy storage system under vehicle-following scenarios. In the vehicle-following level, based on vehicle-to-vehicle and vehicle-to-infrastructure communications, the following vehicle can acquire the real-time velocity and position of the preceding vehicle, optimize the motor electricity consumption, and ensure driving safety through velocity planning. Such cost-effective power demand is further allocated in the energy management level, in order to minimize battery degradation and power losses. Urban, suburban, and highway driving conditions are tested to evaluate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method. Determination of prediction horizon and detailed comparison with existing methods are investigated. Simulation results show that compared with optimizing energy management alone under a classical car-following model, the proposed method can reduce the total operation cost by 4.69–14.55% and yield results closer to offline dynamic programming, which provides the globally optimal results.  aPublisher supplied data 3acost effectiveness 3aelectric energy consumption 3aelectrochemical capacitors 3aenergy 3alithium batteries 3amodels 3aoperating costs 0aHybrid energy storage system 0aModel predictive control 0aVehicle-following 0aEnergy management 0aEconomy analysis 0aV2V/V2I communication1 aHuar, Ziqvud,1 aHofmann, Heath1 aLiu, Yongjie1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8939-33111 aHuang, Jiahao1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4059-14291 aHu, Xiaosong1 aPeng, Jun1 aSong, Ziyou1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3164-52340 tEnergy.g2022 July 15, v. 251 p.123774-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12436x0360-54427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2022.1237743Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02890naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001700140245010700157300002000264500001900284520140900303592002801712650004401740650002301784650001601807650003701823650001501860650001201875650001201887650001101899650001301910650002301923650001701946650001301963650000701976650001401983650001401997650002202011650001702033650002102050650001102071650001902082700001902101700001902120700001402139700001202153773012402165856007402289852000902363655001202372IND60677991220221121121405.0191213e20191129xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067799122DNAL7 a10.1039/c9ra07289f2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWei, Xinxing10aHigh-efficiency adsorption of tetracycline by the prepared waste collagen fiber-derived porous biochar  ap. 39355-39366.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aPorous biochar (PBC) derived from Cr-containing waste collagen fibers was prepared by two-step pyrolysis to 800 °C (PBC-800) and alkali activation. Brunauer–Emmet–Teller (BET) analysis, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Raman spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), X-ray fluorescence (XRF), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and zeta potential analysis were used to characterize PBC-800. Batch experiments showed that PBC-800 had an excellent removal effect on tetracycline (TC), and the maximum adsorption capacity was 593.84 mg g⁻¹. Meanwhile, PBC-800 was found to be suitable for a wide pH range. The isothermal adsorption and kinetic model fitting proved that the TC adsorption by PBC-800 occurred via 5 types of chemical adsorption. The main rate-limiting step was closely related to the initial concentration of TC. The total release of Cr was less than 0.05 mg L⁻¹, which indicated that PBC-800 was stable and did not cause serious secondary pollution. Compared to the conventional metal-free biomass, Cr in a waste collagen fiber (WCF) played an important role in carbon formation and adsorption. The excellent adsorption properties of PBC-800 indicated that it could enrich low concentrations of TC in water. Thus, WCF can be used to prepare cost-effective PBC, which supplies a new process to reuse Cr-containing waste.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aRaman spectroscopy 3aX-radiation 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3aadsorption 3abiochar 3abiomass 3acarbon 3acollagen 3acost effectiveness 3afluorescence 3akinetics 3apH 3apollution 3apyrolysis 3areaction kinetics 3atetracycline 3athermogravimetry 3awastes 3azeta potential1 aZhang, Renjing1 aZhang, Wenchao1 aYuan, Yue1 aLai, Bo0 tRSC advances.g2019 Nov. 29, v. 9, no. 67 p.39355-39366dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c9ra07289f3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02910naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094024002200133024001900155040001800174100002700192245011400219300001600333506007600349520120000425592002801625506003701653650002701690650001301717650002101730650002701751650001601778650001801794650001101812650001701823650001401840650003001854650001101884650002401895650001201919650001501931650002001946650000901966650001201975650002001987653002702007653002502034653003902059653002602098700002702124700002302151773008802174856008502262852000902347655001202356IND60551233920221207105213.0161018e201502  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055123392DNAL7 a10.1016/j.physbeh.2014.10.0322doi7 aPMC45230752pmcid7 a254462272pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 ade La Serre, Claire B.10aChronic exposure to Low dose bacterial lipopolysaccharide inhibits leptin signaling in vagal afferent neurons  ap. 188-194.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBacterially derived factors are implicated in the causation and persistence of obesity. Ingestion of a high fat diet in rodents and obesity in human subjects is associated with chronic elevation of low plasma levels of lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a breakdown product of Gram-negative bacteria. The terminals of vagal afferent neurons are positioned within the gut mucosa to convey information from the gut to the brain to regulate food intake and are responsive to LPS. We hypothesized that chronic elevation of LPS could alter vagal afferent signaling. We surgically implanted osmotic mini-pumps that delivered a constant, low-dose of LPS into the intraperitoneal cavity of rats (12.5μg/kg/hr for 6weeks). LPS-treated rats developed hyperphagia and showed marked changes in vagal afferent neuron function. Chronic LPS treatment reduced vagal afferent leptin signaling, characterized by a decrease in leptin-induced STAT3 phosphorylation. In addition, LPS treatment decreased cholecystokinin-induced satiety. There was no alteration in leptin signaling in the hypothalamus. These findings offer a mechanism by which a change in gut microflora can promote hyperphagia, possibly leading to obesity.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aGram-negative bacteria 3aaltitude 3achronic exposure 3adigestive tract mucosa 3afood intake 3ahigh fat diet 3ahumans 3ahypothalamus 3aingestion 3aintestinal microorganisms 3aleptin 3alipopolysaccharides 3aobesity 3aovereating 3aphosphorylation 3arats 3asatiety 3asensory neurons 0aVagal afferent neurons 0atoll-like receptor 4 0asuppressor of cytokine signaling 3 0ametabolic endotoxemia1 ade Lartigue, Guillaume1 aRaybould, Helen E.0 tPhysiology & behavior.g2015 Feb., v. 139 p.188-194dElsevier Inc.x0031-93847nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.physbeh.2014.10.0323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02909naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245016000169300001400329520134900343592002801692650002201720650002601742650001501768650001901783650002601802650001001828650001201838650001801850650002101868650002601889650002301915650001701938650001101955650001201966651002201978653002102000653002002021653001402041653002002055700002002075700002302095700002302118700001902141773016202160856008402322852000902406655001202415IND60594444620221118081346.0180514e201602  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059444462DNAL7 a10.25225/fozo.v65.i1.a3.20162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMasó, Guillem10aInter-population plasticity in growth and reproduction of invasive bleak, Alburnus alburnus (Cyprinidae, Actinopterygii), in northeastern Iberian Peninsula  ap. 10-14.  aThe bleak, Alburnus alburnus, is an invasive fish in the Iberian Peninsula, where this species mainly disturbs the highly endemic fauna via competition and aggression. Despite this impact, information on bleak autecology is scarce in the Iberian Peninsula, with no data on growth and reproduction. The aim of the present study was to compare bleak populations across four Iberian streams: Muga, Fluvià, Cardener and Foix (northeastern Iberian Peninsula). These streams have similar environmental conditions at the regional scale (e.g. Mediterranean climate, geomorphology). In Muga and Foix streams, bleak showed lower growth rate and back-calculated length at age 2. Body condition was lower in Foix streams, whereas length at maturity was higher. In Muga stream, the proportion of females was lower. In Cardener stream, bleak showed higher back-calculated lengths at ages 1 and 2, growth rate, body condition and reproductive investment. Results showed that bleak populations are able to display wide phenotypic plasticity in small Mediterranean-type rivers. Specifically, bleak population “health” appears to be better in Cardener stream, whereas it is worse in Muga and Foix streams. Present findings suggest that inter-population plasticity allows bleak more successfully to invade Mediterranean fresh waters in the Iberian Peninsula.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAlburnus alburnus 3aMediterranean climate 3aaggression 3abody condition 3aenvironmental factors 3afauna 3afemales 3ageomorphology 3ainvasive species 3aphenotypic plasticity 3apopulation ecology 3areproduction 3arivers 3astreams 3aIberian Peninsula 0aback-calculation 0anon-native fish 0asex-ratio 0asexual maturity1 aLatorre, Daniel1 aTarkan, Ali Serhan1 aVila-Gispert, Anna1 aAlmeida, David0 tFolia zoologica.g2016 Feb., v. 65, no. 1 p.10-14dInstitute of Vertebrate Biology, Academy of Sciences of the Czech RepublicwJournal:14572x0139-78937nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.25225/fozo.v65.i1.a3.20163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02072naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001400140245012600154300002000280500001900300520108700319592002801406650001501434650001601449650002301465650001701488700001301505700001801518700001501536773012401551856007401675852000901749655001201758IND60677991320221121121403.0191213e20191128xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067799132DNAL7 a10.1039/c9ra07305a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiao, Wei10aCd(ii) removal by Fe(ii) surface chemically modified layered double hydroxide–graphene oxide: performance and mechanism  ap. 38982-38989.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aCd(ii) adsorption onto Fe(ii) modified Layered double hydroxide–graphene oxide (LDH–GO@Fe(ii)) was investigated using batch experiments. With the modification of Fe(ii), LDH–GO maintained its structure, while Fe(ii) species formed non-crystalline iron oxide clusters on the surface of the LDH/GO. A kinetics study indicated that adsorption obeyed a pseudo-second-order rate law. The equilibrium data were fitted well with the Langmuir isotherm model. The maximum adsorption capacity of LDH–GO@Fe(ii)₁₀ was 28.98 mg g⁻¹, higher those that of pure LDH–GO and LDH–GO@Fe(ii)₅₀. The increased sorption capacities could be explained by the increased specific surface area. Modification with Fe(ii) would lead to the generation of amorphous Fe oxides and Fe could occupy the binding sites for Cd(ii), thus excess Fe in the structure will restrain the adsorption of Cd(ii). The XRD and XPS patterns revealed the formation of Cd(OH)₂ after adsorption. Batch experiments indicated that precipitation and surface complexation were the main pathways for Cd(ii) removal.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3airon oxides 3asorption isotherms 3asurface area1 aWang, He1 aLi, Hui-qiang1 aYang, Ping0 tRSC advances.g2019 Nov. 28, v. 9, no. 67 p.38982-38989dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c9ra07305a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01782naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094024002200130024001900152040001800171100002400189245007100213300001600284506007600300520044500376592002800821506003700849650001300886650002100899650001400920650002900934650002600963653003400989653002001023653001401043653002001057653001901077653003101096653002901127653001801156773009501174856008201269852000901351655001201360IND60553701120221207104038.0161023e201503  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055370112DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tibs.2015.01.0052doi7 aPMC44100912pmcid7 a256612462pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDuttke, Sascha H.C.10aEvolution and diversification of the basal transcription machinery  ap. 127-129.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aTranscription initiation was once thought to be regulated primarily by sequence-specific transcription factors with the basal transcription machinery being largely invariant.

The multichromophore dendrimers were molecularly engineered to have either three arms, two arms, or one arm; long or short linkers; and a fluorinated dendron (FD) or tert-butyldiphenylsilyl (TBDPS) shell. The EO performance obtained by FDSD (poling efficiency = 1.60 nm² V–²), based on succinic diester linkers, was higher than the analogue with longer adipic diester linkers and higher than the analogs with fewer chromophore moieties. Due to the shorter succinic diester linker and improved site isolation, the dendrimer chromophore with TBDPS groups exhibited enhanced glass-transition temperature (Tg = 108 °C) and comparable poling efficiency (1.62 nm² V–²) to the FD-containing version. These neat EO dendrimers have a higher index of refraction (n = 1.75–1.84 at 1310 nm) than guest–host polymeric EO materials (n ≈ 1.6, 1310 nm) and FTC-type EO dendrimers (n = 1.73, 1310 nm), which is important, because a key metric for Mach–Zehnder modulators is proportional to n³. In addition, binary chromophore organic glasses (BCOGs) were prepared by doping a secondary EO chromophore at 25 wt % into neat dendrimers. Enhancements of EO performance were found in all BCOG materials compared with neat dendrimers due to the effect of blending. As a result of increased chromophore density, the n values of the BCOGs improved to 1.81–1.92. One BOCG, in particular, displayed the highest poling efficiency (2.35 nm² V–²) and largest EO coefficient (r₃₃) value of 275 pm V–¹ at 1310 nm, which represents a high n³r₃₃ figure-of-merit of 1946 pm V–¹. The high poling efficiencies and n³r₃₃ figure-of-merit combined with excellent film forming confirm these neat dendrimers and BCOGs based on them as promising candidates for incorporation into photonic devices.  aPublisher supplied data 3adendrimers 3aengineering 3aglass transition temperature 3amoieties 3aphotons 0anonlinear optics 0adendrimer 0ahyperpolarizability 0abinary chromophore organic glass 0aelectro-optic1 aElder, Delwin L.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9302-38581 aJohnson, Lewis E.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7412-073X1 aRobinson, Bruce H.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5579-953X1 aDalton, Larry R.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6461-01450 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2019 May 22, v. 11, no. 23 p.21058-21068dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.9b053063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03331naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002200150245013000172300001600302520168200318592002802000650001902028650001302047650002902060650000902089650002002098650001402118650002202132650001102154650001902165650002702184650001502211650002402226650000902250650001502259650001202274650003202286650001302318650001202331650001202343651001502355651001002370653002702380653002902407653002002436653001902456653003402475700001902509700002802528700002802556773008702584856008502671852000902756655001202765IND60613257620221120222459.0190705e201808  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061325762DNAL7 a10.1016/j.catena.2018.05.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSulieman, Magboul10aModeling cation exchange capacity in multi geochronological-derived alluvium soils: An approach based on soil depth intervals  ap. 327-339.  aKnowledge of soil chemical properties is indispensable to conduct sustainable land use management in alluvial areas. In this study we developed specific pedotransfer functions for cation exchange capacity (CEC-PTFs) in alluvial soils based on soil depth intervals. A soil data set (n = 1094 samples) at different depths from three different Nile River terraces (lower, middle, and upper) and the lower and upper Blue Nile terraces in Sudan was randomly collected and divided into a training data set (n1 = 900 samples) and a testing data set (n2 = 194 samples) for validation. Soil pH, texture, and organic matter were used as predictor variables to estimate CEC. PTF performance was evaluated with the coefficient of determination (R2), root mean square error (RMSE), and standard error for the estimate (SEE) between the observed and predicted values. Fourteen predictive equations were developed. Results revealed that the CEC of topsoil layers of the lower Nile River terrace were the most difficult to predict (r2 = 0.29 for training) while the deep soil layers (60–120 cm) of the Blue Nile terraces were predicted well (r2 = 0.99 for training). Sixty to 76% of CEC variation of the subsoil of the Nile River terraces could be explained by clay alone. From 85 to 90% of the CEC variation in the deep soils could be explained by organic matter, total silt, and total clay. Validated results indicate that the predictive models based on total clay were less reliable at predicting CEC in the top soil layers. Overall, the CEC-PTFs generated by multiple linear regression models (MLR) provided a reasonable estimate of CEC for most soils investigated.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalluvial soils 3aalluvium 3acation exchange capacity 3aclay 3adata collection 3aequations 3aland use planning 3amodels 3aorganic matter 3apedotransfer functions 3aprediction 3aregression analysis 3asilt 3asoil depth 3asoil pH 3asustainable land management 3aterraces 3atexture 3atopsoil 3aNile River 3aSudan 0aPedotransfer functions 0aCation exchange capacity 0aClay mineralogy 0aAlluvium soils 0aMultivariate adaptive splines1 aSaeed, Ibrahim1 aHassaballa, Abdalhaleem1 aRodrigo-Comino, Jesús,0 tCatena.g2018 Aug., v. 167 p.327-339dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6271x0341-81627nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.catena.2018.05.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03043naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001500151245015200166500001900318520150300337592002801840650002701868650001601895650001301911650001601924650001701940650002001957650001701977650001701994650002102011650001902032650002802051650000902079650002502088650001802113650001302131653003302144653001802177653002102195700001502216700001802231700001802249700001702267700005702284773011302341856008602454852000902540655001202549IND60717356620221120221440.0210226e20210505xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071735662DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhazmat.2020.1245182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWan, Liang10aEffects of moxifloxacin and gatifloxacin stress on growth, photosynthesis, antioxidant responses, and microcystin release in Microcystis aeruginosa  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aMoxifloxacin (MOX) and gatifloxacin (GAT) are fourth-generation fluoroquinolone antibiotics that are frequently detected in surface water environments and pose a threat to aquatic organisms. However, research into their toxicity to Microcystis aeruginosa, a cyanobacterium, has thus far been limited. In the present study, we investigated the effects of these antibiotics on M. aeruginosa growth, photosynthesis, oxidative stress, and microcystin (MC) release. The results of the 96 h EC₅₀ values of MOX and GAT were 60.34 and 25.30 μg/L, respectively, and the risk quotients calculated indicated that these antibiotics could pose considerable ecological risks at actual environmental concentrations. Photosynthetic fluorescence intensity was shown to decline markedly, and Fv/Fm significantly decreased without any evidence of recovery, suggesting that the organism’s photosystems were irreversibly damaged. Chlorophyll a and carotenoid content decreased, whereas the ratio of carotenoids to chlorophyll a increased, indicating that carotenoids were less susceptible to damage than chlorophyll a. The reactive oxygen species and malondialdehyde content significantly increased, as well as the superoxide dismutase and catalase activities, indicating that exposure caused serious oxidative stress. Additionally, MC release increased. These results demonstrate that the environmental risks posed by MOX and GAT should be given serious consideration, particularly as their use is increasing.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMicrocystis aeruginosa 3acarotenoids 3acatalase 3achlorophyll 3afluorescence 3amalondialdehyde 3amicrocystins 3amoxifloxacin 3aoxidative stress 3aphotosynthesis 3areactive oxygen species 3arisk 3asuperoxide dismutase 3asurface water 3atoxicity 0aFluoroquinolones antibiotics 0aCyanobacteria 0aOxidative damage1 aWu, Yixiao1 aZhang, Benhao1 aYang, Wenfeng1 aDing, Huijun1 aZhang, Weihao1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5453-97710 tJournal of hazardous materials.g2021 May 05, v. 409 p.124518-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6200x0304-38947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2020.1245183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01379naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002400148245007600172300001600248520052400264592002800788650002500816650001300841650002300854650001600877700002200893773009500915856008201010852000901092655001201101IND60553701220221119200749.0161023e201503  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055370122DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tibs.2015.01.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRamiro, Almudena R.10aActivation-induced cytidine deaminase and active cytidine demethylation  ap. 172-181.  aThe regulation of demethylation in vertebrates has begun to be elucidated in the past decade.

An introduced freshwater diatom, Didymosphenia geminata, was first discovered in New Zealand in 2004 but there was limited research available to predict the drivers of D. geminata biomass and how biomass variability might influence higher trophic levels (e.g. invertebrates and fish). We examined the effect of D. geminata biomass on benthic invertebrates, invertebrate drift and fish communities in 20 rivers in New Zealand with variable hydrology, physical habitat and water chemistry. Variation in D. geminata biomass was best explained by a model that showed D. geminata biomass increased with time since the last flow event exceeding three times the median annual discharge and decreasing concentration of dissolved reactive phosphorus. Analyses of biotic responses showed that high D. geminata biomass did not affect either invertebrate or fish diversity but altered the structure of benthic communities, changed the composition of drifting invertebrate communities and reduced fish biomass by 90 %, particularly trout. A partial least squares path model was used to disentangle both direct and indirect effects of D. geminata on fish communities and showed D. geminata had a significant negative direct effect on fish communities. This is the first study to show how the potential effects of the introduced diatom D. geminata can impact fish communities and has shown that D. geminata impacts fish both directly and indirectly through changes in their invertebrate prey community.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDidymosphenia geminata 3abenthic organisms 3abiomass 3afish communities 3afreshwater 3ahabitats 3ahumans 3ahydrochemistry 3ainvertebrates 3aleast squares 3amodels 3aphosphorus 3aprey species 3arivers 3astreams 3atrophic levels 3atrout 3aNew Zealand1 aHarding, Jon S.0 tBiological invasions.g2016 Dec., v. 18, no. 12 p.3419-3435dSpringer International Publishingx1387-35477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10530-016-1233-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02946naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245010300170520152000273592002801793650000801821650001401829650002001843650001501863650001901878650001101897650000901908650001301917650001601930650001301946650001701959650001001976650002001986650001902006653002502025653001002050653001602060653002302076653002702099653001402126700001902140700006602159700005502225773009002280856008502370852000902455655001202464IND60770811320221119140020.0220824e20220701xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077081132DNAL7 a10.1016/j.energy.2022.1237782doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPham, Quangkhai10aReview of dual-fuel combustion in the compression-ignition engine: Spray, combustion, and emission  aIncreasing global demand for transport energy and concerns regarding diesel engine emissions have motivated alternative fuels for the internal combustion (IC) engine. Numerous researchers have investigated alternative fuels in the diesel engines’ dual-fuel mode to improve the emission profiles and energy consumption for transportation and distribution activities. In this review, the engine performance, combustion, and emission characteristics of alternative fuels (hydrogen, natural gas, biodiesel) in dual-fuel mode in compression ignition (CI) engines are thoroughly analyzed. Due to different fuel properties in a dual-fuel mode, the size distribution of spray droplets, and consequent mixing with ambient air, generally improve the brake specific energy consumption (BSEC) compared to the baseline diesel mode. However, the performance of the dual-fuel engine based on brake thermal efficiency (BTE) and volumetric efficiency remains significantly lower. The dual-fuel combustion mode in an engine significantly increases the in-cylinder pressure and the heat release rate and extends the ignition delay. The emission characteristics indicated a trade-off between nitrogen oxides and hydrocarbon emissions, and reduced nitrogen oxides, particulate matter, and smoke were influenced by engine load, blend ratio, and injection timing. However, the dual-fuel engine shows a significant increase in hydrocarbons (HC) and carbon monoxide (CO) emissions (up to several times) compared to a normal diesel engine.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3abiodiesel 3acarbon monoxide 3acombustion 3adiesel engines 3aenergy 3aheat 3ahydrogen 3anatural gas 3anitrogen 3aparticulates 3asmoke 3aspecific energy 3atransportation 0aDual-fuel combustion 0aSpray 0aAtomization 0aEmission reduction 0aCombustion improvement 0aCI engine1 aPark, Sungwook1 aAgarwal, Avinash Kumar1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7777-785X1 aPark, Suhan1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2810-26530 tEnergy.g2022 July 01, v. 250 p.123778-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12436x0360-54427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2022.1237783Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01921naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094024002200130024001900152040001800171100001900189245006300208300001600271506007600287520071000363592002801073506003701101650000801138650003201146650002501178650002901203650002601232653001801258653001801276653001501294653001901309700002101328773009501349856008201444852000901526655001201535IND60553701320221207104044.0161023e201503  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055370132DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tibs.2015.01.0072doi7 aPMC43407832pmcid7 a256807572pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRoy, Ananda L.10aCore promoters in transcription: old problem, new insights  ap. 165-171.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aEarly studies established that transcription initiates within an approximately 50bp DNA segment capable of nucleating the assembly of RNA polymerase II (Pol II) and associated general transcription factors (GTFs) necessary for transcriptional initiation; this region is called a core promoter. Subsequent analyses identified a series of conserved DNA sequence elements, present in various combinations or not at all, in core promoters. Recent genome-wide analyses have provided further insights into the complexity of core promoter architecture and function.

However, the development of zinc-ion battery is limited by positive materials, which usually show poor cycling life because of the strong electrostatic interaction between divalent Zn²⁺ ions and crystal structure of materials. Developing a cathode material with a stable structure upon cycling is still a big challenge for researchers worldwide. Doping foreign elements, which can solidify the lattice, is an effective approach to improve the structural stability of materials. However, hardly any research based on the doping method for aqueous ZIBs has been reported. Here, we develop an Al-doped layer material of V₁₀O₂₄·12H₂O as cathode material for aqueous ZIBs. Benefitting from the stable layered structure, the material exhibited an excellent cycling life with 98% capacity retention after 3000 cycles, which is much higher than the 65% in the pure V₁₀O₂₄·12H₂O. The great enhancement on the cycle performance indicates that Al-doping can help build an advanced zinc-storage system.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaluminum 3acathodes 3acrystal structure 3aelectrostatic interactions 3aions 3alithium batteries 3aprices 3arenewable energy sources 3azinc 0aenergy storage 0azinc-ion battery 0avanadium oxide 0aAl doping 0along life1 aWei, Tongye1 aMa, Kaixuan1 aYang, Gongzheng1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9193-74371 aWang, Chengxin1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8355-64310 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2019 May 22, v. 11, no. 23 p.20888-20894dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.9b053623Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03051naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001900155245012800174300001400302520173900316592002802055650002202083650001702105650001102122650001302133650001502146650001302161650003302174650001602207650001702223651001002240653002402250653003702274653001702311653003002328653002102358653002202379700002102401773010802422856009002530852000902620655001202629IND60541352020221120070217.0190318e201508  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054135202DNAL7 a10.1016/j.landurbplan.2015.04.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVizzari, Marco10aLandscape sequences along the urban–rural–natural gradient: A novel geospatial approach for identification and analysis  ap. 42-55.  aHuman influence on the environment differs in terms of distribution and intensity, thus producing a gradient of landscape modifications that translates into different landscape structures. Within this variety of landscapes, fringe areas represent complex spaces where dynamic processes and instable conditions can be observed. In this research Kernel Density Estimation, multivariate spatial analysis, landscape pattern analysis, and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) were combined to model and characterise landscape gradients, and to analyse the structural features of fringe areas. This methodology was applied to a rural area of central Italy, using density indicators associated with urbanisation, agriculture, and natural elements considered to be key components for the identification of landscape gradients. The results highlight not only specific “pillar” landscapes, which are dominated by said components, but also transitional landscapes, where the most relevant forms of interaction between land uses were identified. Characterisation of landscape structures along the gradient illustrated different trends in patch density, shape complexity and landscape diversity, demonstrating greater variability in fringe areas than in pillar landscapes. PCA revealed a partial overlap between the main structural characteristics of the agro-forestry matrix and the medium intensity agricultural landscapes, whereas urban fringes and semi-natural fringes were clearly separated. The discovery of the continuous landscape gradients and an understanding of the gamut of landscape types nested along them is crucial in allowing for more effective land-use planning in which also fringe areas become a relevant part of the process.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural land 3aagroforestry 3ahumans 3aland use 3alandscapes 3aplanning 3aprincipal component analysis 3arural areas 3aurbanization 3aItaly 0aLandscape gradients 0aUrban–rural–natural gradient 0aFringe areas 0aKernel density estimation 0aCluster analysis 0aLandscape metrics1 aSigura, Maurizia0 tLandscape and urban planning.g2015 Aug., v. 140 p.42-55dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12405x0169-20467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.landurbplan.2015.04.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04089naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002500148245025600173300001800429520225000447592002802697650005302725650002002778650001802798650002802816650001602844650001802860650001402878650001602892650001702908650002202925650001102947650001402958650001402972650001402986650002403000650002803024650002103052650002403073653001603097653001103113653001703124653002103141653002503162700001303187700002203200700002603222700002603248773018103274856008303455852000903538655001203547IND60716471620221119125122.0211114e202107  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071647162DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jand.2020.08.0852doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSullivan, Valerie K.10aConsumption of Dried Fruits Is Associated with Greater Intakes of Underconsumed Nutrients, Higher Total Energy Intakes, and Better Diet Quality in US Adults: A Cross-Sectional Analysis of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, 2007-2016  ap. 1258-1272.  aDried fruits are shelf-stable alternatives to fresh fruit that avert common barriers to consuming fruit. Consumption of dried fruits may facilitate greater fruit consumption and contribute to better diet quality and nutrient intakes.Our aims were to assess differences in diet quality and cardiometabolic health between dried fruit consumers and nonconsumers, and evaluate differences in nutrient intakes on days when dried fruits were consumed vs not consumed.This is a cross-sectional analysis of data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2007-2016.Mean dried fruit intakes were estimated in adults 20 years and older (n = 25,590) who completed a dietary recall. Dried fruit consumers (one-quarter cup-equivalent/day or more) were defined in respondents with 2 complete dietary recalls (n = 22,311). Within-person differences in nutrient intakes were assessed in respondents who consumed dried fruit on 1 of 2 dietary recalls (n = 1,233).Cardiometabolic risk factors, diet quality scored using the Healthy Eating Index 2015, and nutrient intakes were assessed.Diet quality and cardiometabolic health were compared in consumers vs nonconsumers using multivariate linear regression, adjusted for demographic and lifestyle factors. Within-person differences in nutrient intakes on days when dried fruits were consumed vs not were assessed using multivariate linear regression.Mean ± standard error dried fruit intake was 0.04 ± 0.001 cup-equivalents and represented 3.7% of total fruit consumed. Consumers (7.2% of adults) had higher quality diets than nonconsumers (mean ± standard error Healthy Eating Index 2015 score = 60.6 ± 0.5 vs 52.6 ± 0.3; P < 0.001) and lower mean body mass index, waist circumference, and systolic blood pressure (P < 0.01). Total carbohydrate, dietary fiber, potassium, and polyunsaturated fat intakes were greater on days when dried fruits were consumed vs not consumed (P < 0.001). Total calorie intakes were also greater (208-215 kcal; P ≤ 0.002) when dried fruits were consumed.Dried fruit consumption is associated with higher diet quality and greater intakes of underconsumed nutrients. However, dried fruits do not appear to displace other calorie sources on days when consumed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aNational Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 3abody mass index 3acarbohydrates 3across-sectional studies 3adiet recall 3adietary fiber 3adietetics 3adried fruit 3afood quality 3afruit consumption 3afruits 3alifestyle 3apotassium 3araw fruit 3aregression analysis 3asystolic blood pressure 3aunsaturated fats 3awaist circumference 0aDried fruit 0aNHANES 0aDiet quality 0aNutrient intakes 0aCardiometabolic risk1 aNa, Muzi1 aProctor, David N.1 aKris-Etherton, P.

In SDP, there is a need to calculate the transition probability matrix more accurately and efficiently in order to improve the economic benefit of reservoir operation. In this study, we proposed a stochastic optimization model for hydropower generation reservoirs, in which 1) the transition probability matrix was calculated based on copula functions; and 2) the value function of the last period was calculated by stepwise iteration. Firstly, the marginal distribution of stochastic inflow in each period was built and the joint distributions of adjacent periods were obtained using the three members of the Archimedean copulas, based on which the conditional probability formula was derived. Then, the value in the last period was calculated by a simple recursive equation with the proposed stepwise iteration method and the value function was fitted with a linear regression model. These improvements were incorporated into the classic SDP and applied to the case study in Ertan reservoir, China. The results show that the transition probability matrix can be more easily and accurately obtained by the proposed copula function based method than conventional methods based on the observed or synthetic streamflow series, and the reservoir operation benefit can also be increased.  aPublisher supplied data 3acase studies 3adynamic programming 3aequations 3afinancial economics 3aissues and policy 3amodels 3aprobability distribution 3aregression analysis 3astream flow 3auncertainty 3awater power 3aChina 0aStochastic dynamic programming (SDP) 0aCopula function 0aReservoir operation 0aUncertainty 0aValue function1 aTan, Qiao-feng1 aWang, Xu1 aWang, Hao1 aWen, Xin1 aWang, Chao1 aZhang, Jing-wen0 tJournal of hydrology.g2018 Feb., v. 557 p.265-275dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl46539x0022-16947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2017.12.0383Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04188naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001500147245015600162506011700318506007600435520250300511592002803014506003703042650001303079650002003092650001103112650001603123650001303139650001503152650001903167650001703186650001503203650002503218651001003243653001703253653002303270653001703293653001603310653002403326700001703350700001903367700001203386700001703398700001703415700001603432700001303448773015203461856004803613852000903661655001203670IND60778105620221207113217.0220523e202109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077810562DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jag.2021.1023512doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHe, Yingli10aExamining rice distribution and cropping intensity in a mixed single- and double-cropping region in South China using all available Sentinel 1/2 images  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aPaddy rice agriculture in Southern China, especially Hunan Province, has been suffered from soil contamination. Several policies including rice fallow and decreasing cropping intensity have been implemented for food safety here. It is thus important to monitor rice planting area and cropping intensity to understand the effectiveness of those land-use policies. However, it is challenging to map rice planting areas due to the complex cropping systems (mixed single- and double-cropping), persistent cloud covers, small crop fields, let alone cropping intensity. Here we used all the available Sentinel-2 and all-weather Sentinel-1 imagery to generate a time series data cube to extract paddy rice planting areas and the rice cropping intensity in the Changsha, Zhuzhou, and Xiangtan areas, which is a traditional rice-growing region with small farms in China. Specifically, we investigated the performances of different features (i.e., spectral, seasonal, polarization backscatter) by comparing five scenarios with different combinations of sensors and features, and identified the most suitable features for certain rice types (early, middle, and late rice). The random forest classifier was used for the classification in the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform, and a reference map in 2017 based on visual interpretation on the GaoFen-2 images were used for collecting the training and validation samples. The results showed the combined data from Sentinel-1/2 generally outperformed classifications using only a single sensor (Sentinel-1/2), but the contribution of different sensors to certain rice types varied. The early, middle and late rice with the highest accuracies within the five scenarios had the overall accuracies of 85%, 95%, and 95%, respectively (F1 = 0.55, 0.85, and 0.85). The compositing of different types of rice allowed us to generate the rice cropping intensity map with an overall accuracy of 81%, which to our limited knowledge is the first effort to map cropping intensity at 10-m resolution in such a fragmented subtropical region. The result showed the single cropping dominated the rice cropping system in the study area 88%, which used to be a typical area with double cropping of rice. Our study demonstrates the potential of mapping rice cropping intensity in a cloudy and highly fragmented region in South China using all the available Sentinel-1/2 data, which would advance our understanding of regional rice production and mitigation of soil contamination.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aInternet 3adouble cropping 3afallow 3afood safety 3aland use 3arough rice 3asoil pollution 3aspatial data 3asubtropics 3atime series analysis 3aChina 0aRice mapping 0aCropping intensity 0aSentinel-1/2 0aTime series 0aGoogle Earth Engine1 aDong, Jinwei1 aLiao, Xiaoyong1 aSun, Li1 aWang, Zhipan1 aYou, Nanshan1 aLi, Zhichao1 aFu, Ping0 tInternational journal of applied earth observation and geoinformation.g2021 Sept., v. 101 p.102351-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:21448x1569-84327nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jag.2021.102351  aDNAL 7aarticle02976naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024003800129040001800167100002200185245014200207300001800349520173400367592002802101650002102129650001102150650001302161650001102174650002102185650001002206650001502216650001002231650001402241650001502255650001302270651001402283700003002297700001602327700001702343773011602360856008102476852000902557655001202566IND60569706320221119213346.0170608e201612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056970632DNAL7 a10.1007/s10530-016-1248-52doi7 a10.1007/s10530-016-1248-52chorus  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTobin, Patrick C.10aAll quiet on the western front? Using phenological inference to detect the presence of a latent gypsy moth invasion in Northern Minnesota  ap. 3561-3573.  aFollowing establishment in a new environment, invasive species expand their range through stratified diffusion, the coupling of local growth and spatial spread with long-distance movement of propagules that found new colonies. Consequently, the stages of arrival and establishment serially repeat until the entire habitat susceptible to invasion is occupied. An empirical example of such a phenomenon is the gypsy moth, Lymantria dispar (L.), invasion of northeastern Minnesota. Under a regional management program, a trapping grid is deployed along the L. dispar leading edge to detect male moth presence and inform management decisions. However, the presence of moths does not always indicate reproducing populations, and moths dispersing from populations behind the front can obscure the presence of latent invasions. We analyzed trapping data during the arrival and establishment of L. dispar in this region (2000–2012), supplemented with sentinel trap data to ascertain the timing of male moth flight (2005–2009), and derived yearly phenological predictions for male moth flight. We also used a male wing morphology metric (2007–2009) to further quantify spatial and temporal patterns associated with the L. dispar invasion. We provide evidence of an established L. dispar population when analyses suggest spatial randomness in trap catch data, and how the presence of phenologically distinct, immigrating adult moths from source populations outside of Minnesota recorded from sentinel traps could lead to the overestimation of the abundance of an established population. This work highlights the complexity of the initial invasion process even in a well-studied system for which a sensitive monitoring program exists.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLymantria dispar 3aflight 3ahabitats 3aimagos 3ainvasive species 3amales 3amonitoring 3amoths 3aphenology 3aprediction 3atrapping 3aMinnesota1 aCremers, Kimberly Thielen1 aHunt, Lucia1 aParry, Dylan0 tBiological invasions.g2016 Dec., v. 18, no. 12 p.3561-3573dSpringer International Publishingx1387-35477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10530-016-1248-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01712naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002500148245010400173300001800277520052600295592002800821650001700849650002600866650002600892650002500918650001700943650001900960650002100979650001401000700002901014700001901043700002301062700002201085773011701107856008201224990002301306852000901329655001201338IND60090921920221120160312.0141102e20110801xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009092192DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bmcl.2011.06.0512doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSergeeva, Natalia N.10aSimple but powerful: Phenanthroline-based small molecules for cellular imaging and cancer screening  ap. 4385-4388.  aA two-step synthetic procedure gives highly fluorescent phenanthroline molecular probes.

Lateralisation refers to the collection of phenomena in which external stimuli are perceived and processed differentially on the two sides of the brain and/or certain behaviours are preferentially performed by one side of the body. We trained 29 dwarf goats in a Y-maze, directing them to the opposite alley from that chosen in a free pre-run. In total, 13 goats were trained to the left alley (L-goats) and 16 goats to the right alley (R-goats). Recall of the trained alley was tested three months later. We then analysed reversal learning across 10 reversals. During training, the direction of the alley had an impact on learning. The number of runs required to reach the learning criterion was significantly lower in the L- than the R-goats. The goats recalled the trained alley three months later, with no difference between the L- and the R-goats. During the reversal learning, the reversal only tended to impact learning performance, whereas the directions of the new and the initially trained alley did not. Goats did not adopt a general rule with which to master the maze (e.g., win-stay/lose-shift) across the 10 reversals. Our results indicate a right hemisphere bias in the processing of visuospatial cues in the maze during initial training; however, no such impact was detected during reversal learning.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCapra hircus 3abrain 3agoats 3alearning0 tBehavioural processes.g2012 Mar., v. 89, no. 3 p.304-310dElsevier B.V.x0376-63577nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.beproc.2011.12.0133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02983naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100005500144245011100199300002000310520141600330592002801746650001101774650001301785650002101798650001701819650002201836650002101858650001301879653004201892653002201934653002801956653002201984653001402006700001702020700001502037700001902052700005602071700001602127700001702143700001802160700005702178700005002235773014102285856007802426852000902504655001202513IND60646505620221120142542.0190612e20190522xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064650562DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.9b055162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHe, Linchun1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4786-971010aFailure Mechanism and Interface Engineering for NASICON-Structured All-Solid-State Lithium Metal Batteries  ap. 20895-20904.  aAll-solid-state lithium metal batteries (ASSLiMB) have been considered as one of the most promising next-generation high-energy storage systems that replace liquid organic electrolytes by solid-state electrolytes (SSE). Among many different types of SSE, NASICON-structured Li₁₊ₓAlₓGe₂–ₓ(PO₃)₄ (LAGP) shows high a ionic conductivity, high stability against moisture, and wide working electrochemical windows. However, it is unstable when it is in contact with molten Li, hence largely limiting its applications in ASSLiMB. To solve this issue, we have studied reaction processes and mechanisms between LAGP and molten Li, based on which a failure mechanism is hence proposed. With better understanding the failure mechanism, a thin thermosetting Li salt polymer, P(AA-co-MA)Li, layer is coated on the bare LAGP pellet before contacting with molten Li. To further increase the ionic conductivity of P(AA-co-MA)Li, LiCl is added in P(AA-co-MA)Li. A symmetric cell of Li/interface/LAGP/interface/Li is prepared using molten Li–Sn alloy and galvanically cycled at current densities of 15, 30, and 70 μA cm–² for 100 cycles, showing stable low overpotentials of 0.036, 0.105, and 0.257 V, respectively. These electrochemical results demonstrate that the interface coating of P(AA-co-MA)Li can be an effective method to avoid an interfacial reaction between the LAGP electrolyte and molten Li.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalloys 3acoatings 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrolytes 3alithium batteries 3alithium chloride 3apolymers 0aall-solid-state lithium metal battery 0aNASICON structure 0asolid-state electrolyte 0afailure mechanism 0ainterface1 aSun, Qiaomei1 aChen, Chao1 aOh, Jin An Sam1 aSun, Jianguo1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2222-24781 aLi, Minchan1 aTu, Wenqiang1 aZhou, Henghui1 aZeng, Kaiyang1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3348-00181 aLu, Li1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9670-94300 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2019 May 22, v. 11, no. 23 p.20895-20904dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.9b055163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03252naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001200150245017400162300001600336500001900352520171800371592002802089650002502117650002502142650001602167650001302183650001202196650001602208650002802224650002002252650001502272650001602287650001602303650001902319650002102338650001302359653001602372653002902388653002202417653001302439700001202452700001802464700001602482700001502498700001502513773012402528856008502652852000902737655001202746IND60737521420221118063103.0210603e202107  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073752142DNAL7 a10.1016/j.plaphy.2021.05.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWu, Lin10aIdentification and characterisation of monovalent cation/proton antiporters (CPAs) in Phyllostachys edulis and the functional analysis of PheNHX2 in Arabidopsis thaliana  ap. 205-221.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aPlant monovalent cation/proton antiporters (CPAs), types of transmembrane transporters, play important roles in resistance to salt stress. In this study, 37 CPA genes from moso bamboo (Phyllostachys edulis) were identified and characterised. The expression profiles of 10 CPA1 genes (PheNHXs) of moso bamboo were detected by qRT-PCR, which showed that they were specifically expressed in six tissues. In addition, the expression of 10 PheNHXs in leaves and roots changed significantly under 150/200 mM NaCl and 100 μM ABA treatments. In particular, the expression of PheNHX2 in leaves and roots was significantly upregulated under NaCl treatment, thus, we cloned PheNHX2 and analysed its function. Subcellular localisation analysis showed that PheNHX2 was located on the vacuolar membrane. Overexpression of PheNHX2 reduced seed germination and root growth of Arabidopsis thaliana under salt stress, as well as severely affecting cellular Na⁺ and K⁺ content, which in turn reduced the salt tolerance of transgenic Arabidopsis. Measurements of physiological indicators, including chlorophyll content, malondialdehyde content, peroxidase and catalase enzyme activities and relative electrical conductivity, all supported this conclusion. Under salt stress, PheNHX2 also inhibited the expression of some stress-related and ion transport-related genes in transgenic Arabidopsis. Overall, these results indicate that overexpression of PheNHX2 reduces the salt tolerance of transgenic Arabidopsis. This investigation establishes a foundation for subsequent functional studies of moso bamboo CPA genes, and it provides a deeper understanding of PheNHX2 regulation in relation to the salt tolerance of moso bamboo.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3aPhyllostachys edulis 3aantiporters 3acatalase 3acations 3achlorophyll 3aelectrical conductivity 3amalondialdehyde 3aperoxidase 3aroot growth 3asalt stress 3asalt tolerance 3aseed germination 3avacuoles 0aMoso bamboo 0aCation/proton antiporter 0aNa+/H+ antiporter 0aVacuolar1 aWu, Min1 aLiu, Huanlong1 aGao, Yameng1 aChen, Feng1 aXiang, Yan0 tPlant physiology and biochemistry.g2021 July, v. 164 p.205-221dElsevier Masson SASwJournal:jnl41590x0981-94287nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.plaphy.2021.05.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03246naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002300148245010500171300001600276520173900292592002802031650001102059650002202070650002402092650002702116650001402143650001802157650001602175650001202191650003102203650001102234651001602245653002602261653005202287653000902339653001302348653003302361700002402394700002102418700002002439700002302459700002302482773017902505856008302684852000902767655001202776IND60716471920221119125124.0220110e202102  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071647192DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jand.2020.08.0882doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFangupo, Louise J.10aUltra-Processed Food Intake and Associations With Demographic Factors in Young New Zealand Children  ap. 305-313.  aChildren consume ultra-processed food (UPF) from a young age, but the proportional contribution of UPF to young children’s total energy intakes has not been evaluated in developed countries.To describe UPF intake and associations with demographic factors in young children from 12 to 60 months of age.Cohort study comprising a secondary analysis of data from a randomized controlled trial. Demographic data were collected by questionnaire. At 12, 24, and 60 months of age validated food frequency questionnaires estimated percentage of energy intake from UPF (%kcal UPF).The 669 children were born in Dunedin, New Zealand, between May 2009 and December 2010.Mean percentage of energy intake from UPF at 12, 24, and 60 months of age, mean differences in %kcal UPF by demographic variables.Mixed effects regression models were used to estimate relationships between demographics and %kcal UPF. Multiple imputation methods were used to impute missing UPF data.UPF contributed mean (95% confidence interval) 45% (44%, 47%), 42% (41%, 44%), and 51% (50%, 52%) of energy intake to the diets of children at 12, 24, and 60 months of age, respectively. Energy intake from UPF was moderately correlated between 24 and 60 months (r = 0.36). No demographic factors were associated with mean %kcal UPF across time points, except for maternal obesity predicting higher UPF intake at 12 months. Bread, yoghurt, crackers, whole-wheat breakfast cereal, sausages, and muesli bars were among the 10 foods making the greatest contribution to mean %kcal UPF intakes at all time points.UPF contribute a substantial proportion of energy to the diets of young children. A range of foods with varying nutritional profiles contribute to these high intakes.  aPublisher supplied data 3abreads 3abreakfast cereals 3aconfidence interval 3ademographic statistics 3adietetics 3aenergy intake 3afood intake 3aobesity 3arandomized clinical trials 3ayogurt 3aNew Zealand 0aUltra-processed foods 0aPercentage of energy from ultra-processed foods 0aNOVA 0aChildren 0aEarly life feeding practices1 aHaszard, Jillian J.1 aTaylor, Barry J.1 aGray, Andrew R.1 aLawrence, Julie A.1 aTaylor, Rachael W.0 tJournal of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics.g2021 Feb., v. 121, no. 2 p.305-313dElsevier Inc.aAcademy of Nutrition and DieteticswJournal:J000001156x2212-26727nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jand.2020.08.0883Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02697naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100005700144245010400201300002000305520116900325592002801494650001301522650001601535650001301551650001101564650001401575650001101589650001801600650001601618653001701634653002501651653003601676653002401712653003401736700005601770700001301826700001701839700005601856700005701912700005401969773014102023856007802164852000902242655001202251IND60646505720221120142608.0190612e20190522xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064650572DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.9b055542doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXia, Yuanmeng1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1930-948410aMultifunctional Glycerol–Water Hydrogel for Biomimetic Human Skin with Resistance Memory Function  ap. 21117-21125.  aBiomimetic human skinlike materials with preferably self-healing ability, high sensitivity for external stimuli, and good adhesiveness against diverse substrates under a wide range of temperatures are of great importance in various applications such as wearable devices, human-motion devices, and soft robotics. However, most of the reported biomimetic human skinlike materials lack memory function, i.e., they cannot memorize the external stimuli once the stimuli disappear. This drawback hinders their applications in mimicking the human skin in real world. Here, a polyacrylamide/Au@polydopamine glycerol–water (GW) hydrogel has been designed to address this challenge. The as-prepared GW hydrogel exhibits a fast self-healing efficiency and good adhesiveness against diverse substrates under a wide range of temperatures (from −15 to 37 °C). Additionally, our GW hydrogel also possesses good perceived ability for external stimuli and subtle/large human motions. Most importantly, resistance memory function has been realized based on our GW hydrogel. These outstanding properties make it potentially significant in mimicking the human skin in real world.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadhesion 3abiomimetics 3aglycerol 3ahumans 3ahydrogels 3arobots 3askin (animal) 3atemperature 0aantifreezing 0aself-healing ability 0abioinspired conductive hydrogel 0ahuman-motion sensor 0aresistance memory performance1 aWu, Yuanpeng1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6106-18681 aYu, Tian1 aXue, Shishan1 aGuo, Meiling1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8769-21471 aLi, Jingliang1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0709-22461 aLi, Zhenyu1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0994-04050 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2019 May 22, v. 11, no. 23 p.21117-21125dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.9b055543Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02446naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100005800150245011000208520129900318592002801617650000901645650002001654651001001674653002701684653003801711653003201749653004001781653002001821700005101841700001401892700001801906773009001924856008502014852000902099655001202108IND60770811920221119140109.0220824e20220701xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077081192DNAL7 a10.1016/j.energy.2022.1237862doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Xiaomei1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1124-644710aAnalysis of Shanxi Province's energy consumption and intensity using input-output framework (2002–2017)  aShanxi Province is one of the main bases of coal production and consumption in China. We apply the input-output (I–O) framework to study both energy consumption and intensity in Shanxi Province and the factors contributing to their changes at the final demand and sector levels from 2002 to 2017. Among final demand categories, the largest contributors to embodied energy consumption were investment and private consumption. The total final demand effect was responsible for 184.66% of the growth of embodied energy consumption over the study period. The energy intensity effect was the most important factor affecting the change of aggregate embodied energy intensity. At the sector level, construction and mining sectors were the largest contributors to embodied energy consumption. The smelting and pressing of metals, coking, and chemical products sectors had the greatest impact on aggregate embodied energy intensity. The weight of products and services related to residential life on changes in the aggregate embodied energy intensity increased during the study period. Inspired by the analysis results, long-term policies that promote the transformation and development of the regional economy in accordance with the characteristics of the region's resource endowment are recommended.  aPublisher supplied data 3acoal 3aembodied energy 3aChina 0aInput-output framework 0aStructural decomposition analysis 0aEmbodied energy consumption 0aAggregate embodied energy intensity 0aShanxi Province1 aSu, Bin1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4273-70541 aYang, Jun1 aCong, Jianhui0 tEnergy.g2022 July 01, v. 250 p.123786-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12436x0360-54427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2022.1237863Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03146naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001600146245012600162300001600288520165200304592002801956650002201984650001502006650001502021650002502036650001002061650001802071650001502089650000902104650003102113650001302144650001202157650001502169650001902184650001202203650001302215650001302228650001302241650001602254650001902270653001202289653001502301653001802316653001902334700001802353700002002371700001702391773011902408856008002527852000902607655001202616IND60655195320221123024427.0190731e201903  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065519532DNAL7 a10.1177/00405175187607522doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVivod, Vera10aHighly efficient film-like nanocellulose-based adsorbents for the removal of loose reactive dye during textile laundering  ap. 975-988.  aCellulose nanofibrils (CNFs) were surface functionalized with hexamethylenediamine (HMDA) and, further, integrated with native CNFs in various weight mass ratios to fabricate water-stable films by the solvent casting method, to be used for the removal of tri-chromatic and anionic black reactive dye with the highest bleeding effect in the very first minutes of textile laundering, and in a weight mass compared to a commercial color-catcher sheet (Delta Pronatura (DP)). The effects of CNF-HMDA content on film bath absorption, surface potential and contact angle properties, as well as dye removal kinetics from different laundering baths (A – without and B – with a detergent) in up to 140 min were studied at 20℃ versus 60℃ and using different dye concentrations (0.1–1 g/L). It was found that bath absorption is decreased significantly (up to 60%) by increasing the CNF-HMDA content in the films, as compared to using a DP color-catcher sheet, due to a morphologically denser structure with surface-positioned hydrophobic ethylene moieties of HMDA, as well as reducing electrostatic attraction groups of CNF and HMDA. Such a surface interacts kinetically faster with anionic and hydrophobic dye molecules already at 20℃, reaching up to 37–80% removal of all dye colorants in the first 20 min. In contrast, the dye removal efficacy of the DP color-catcher sheet is due to it interacting with a cationic polymer being released from the surface, which is better only for a bluish color, and at 60℃, while being between 30% and 48%, as its release is hindered and reduced by the deposition of surfactants from the detergent.  aPublisher supplied data 3a1,6-hexanediamine 3aabsorption 3aadsorbents 3acellulose nanofibers 3acolor 3acontact angle 3adetergents 3adyes 3aelectrostatic interactions 3aethylene 3afabrics 3ahemorrhage 3ahydrophobicity 3alaundry 3amoieties 3apolymers 3asolvents 3asurfactants 3atextile fibers 0atextile 0alaundering 0ananocellulose 0acolor-catching1 aNeral, Branko1 aMihelič, Aleš1 aKokol, Vanja0 tTextile research journal.g2019 Mar., v. 89, no. 6 p.975-988dSAGE PublicationswJournal:jnl46536x1746-77487nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/00405175187607523Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03812naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245014700163506011700310506007600427520236800503592002802871506003702899650001102936650001702947650001302964650001402977650001102991650001403002650002203016650001503038650001703053653001003070653001803080653002903098653002003127653001803147700001603165773015203181856004803333852000903381655001203390IND60778106020221207113218.0220523e202109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077810602DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jag.2021.1023562doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Tongwen10aEstimating daily full-coverage surface ozone concentration using satellite observations and a spatiotemporally embedded deep learning approach  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aChina has experienced an increasing and spreading trend of ozone (O₃) pollution in recent years, which can be of significant threat to human health. High-resolution full-coverage O₃ data will be highly valuable for O₃ pollution prevention and control. To this end, a spatiotemporally embedded deep residual learning model (STE-ResNet) is proposed in this study to obtain daily high-resolution surface O₃ concentration data, by the integration of surface station O₃ measurements, satellite O₃ precursors, reanalysis data, and emissions data. The proposed model uses a novel temporal and spatial embedding technique to represent the temporal (year, month, and day) and spatial (latitude and longitude) information, rather than directly inputting the temporal and spatial information into the neural network. Meanwhile, a gap-filling approach is developed to reconstruct the missing data in the satellite-retrieved O₃, so that daily full-coverage O₃ data can thus be generated. The proposed approach was applied to a heavily polluted region of China, namely, the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (denoted as GBA), where a world-class city agglomeration is being built. The sample-based cross validation (CV), spatial-based CV, temporal-based CV, and external validation demonstrate high consistency with the station measurements, with R² values of 0.93, 0.90, 0.89, and 0.70, respectively, at a daily level. The spatiotemporal embedding promotes the estimation accuracy compared to directly inputting the temporal and spatial information, with the sample-based CV R² value increasing from 0.91 to 0.93. The daily full-coverage surface O₃ concentrations were obtained at a spatial resolution of 0.05°, and it was found the O₃ pollution hotspot is located in the center of the GBA, with mean values of mostly > 80 μg/m³. In the worst case, about 60% of the days in autumn have O₃ concentrations exceeding the standard (i.e., 160 μg/m³) in the city of Zhongshan. Furthermore, for a serious pollution incident that occurred on April 9, 2020, the reconstructed O₃ data show superior monitoring capabilities, due to the full coverage, when compared with the station measurements and satellite retrievals. The approach proposed in this study will be of great value for the fine-scale and continuous monitoring of O₃ pollution.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aautumn 3ahuman health 3alatitude 3alongitude 3amodels 3apollution 3apollution control 3asatellites 3aspatial data 0aOzone 0aDeep learning 0aSpatiotemporal embedding 0aHigh resolution 0aFull coverage1 aCheng, Xiao0 tInternational journal of applied earth observation and geoinformation.g2021 Sept., v. 101 p.102356-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:21448x1569-84327nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jag.2021.102356  aDNAL 7aarticle02309naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245008200170300001600252520131900268592002801587650002301615650001501638650001401653650001401667650001001681650001201691650001801703650000901721650001001730650001101740700002101751773009401772856008401866852000901950655001201959IND60084758120221119212323.0141101e201203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008475812DNAL7 a10.1016/j.beproc.2011.10.0172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTedore, Cynthia10aWeaponry, color, and contest success in the jumping spider Lyssomanes viridis  ap. 203-211.  aWeaponry and color badges are commonly theorized to function as visual signals of aggressiveness or fighting ability. However, few studies have supported a signaling function of weaponry, and the role of color in invertebrate competitive interactions remains virtually unexplored. Jumping spiders (Salticidae) make excellent invertebrate models for studying weaponry and color because males of many species are colorful and possess exaggerated chelicerae, which are used as weapons in escalated contests. To determine whether color or weaponry might function as visual signals in male–male competitions, we investigated relationships between contest success, cheliceral length, and red coloration in Lyssomanes viridis. Males having longer chelicerae than their opponents were significantly more likely to win (p=0.0008). Males who won, despite being smaller than their opponents, had significantly less red chelicerae than their opponents (p=0.01). Male and female cheliceral length, as well as foreleg length, correlated tightly with body size. Cheliceral and foreleg length showed significantly stronger positive allometry in males than in females. We conclude that male chelicerae and forelegs are under strong positive selection for their use in physical fights and/or as visual signals of fighting ability.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLyssomanes viridis 3aaggression 3aallometry 3abody size 3acolor 3afemales 3ainvertebrates 3alegs 3amales 3amodels1 aJohnsen, Sönke,0 tBehavioural processes.g2012 Mar., v. 89, no. 3 p.203-211dElsevier B.V.x0376-63577nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.beproc.2011.10.0173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02707naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245013100170500001900301520133200320592002801652650001801680650001501698650002001713650002101733650001801754650001301772650001301785650001701798653003101815653001601846653000901862653002701871700005401898700001801952700001101970700001401981700001301995700005702008773011302065856008602178852000902264655001202273IND60717357320221120221429.0210226e20210505xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071735732DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhazmat.2020.1245282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Jinding,12aA novel N,S-rich COF and its derived hollow N,S-doped carbon@Pd nanorods for electrochemical detection of Hg2+ and paracetamol  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aCovalent-organic frameworks (COFs) are conjugate crystalline polymers with high porosity, controllable pores and structure as well as large specific surface area, showing great potential for electrochemical sensors. Here, a new N,S-rich COFBTT₋TZT is proposed by direct amine-aldehyde dehydration condensation between 4,4',4′'-(1,3,5-triazine-2,4,6-triyl)trianiline (TZT) and benzo [1,2-b:3,4-b':5,6-b'']trithiophene-2,5,8-tricarbaldehyde (BTT). The COFBTT₋TZT has a hexagonal hcb structure with theoretical pore of 2.2 nm and presents rod-like morphology with many small flakes on its surface. Particularly, there are lots of S and N atoms in COFBTT₋TZT, which provides abundant adsorption sites for Hg²⁺ so that it can be used to detect Hg²⁺. The proposed Hg²⁺ sensor has a linear range of 0.54 nM–5.0 μM and a detection limit of 0.18 nM. Besides, using COFBTT₋TZT as precursor and template, the hollow N,S-doped C@Pd nanorods which possesses many tiny Pd nanoparticles embedded in rods-like hollow structure are obtained. An electrochemical paracetamol sensor is also proposed based on the N,S-doped C@Pd nanorods, showing low detection limit of 11 nM and wide linear range of 33 nM–120 μM. The good results provide an important guidance for the application of COF in electrochemical sensors.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetaminophen 3aadsorption 3adetection limit 3aelectrochemistry 3ananocatalysts 3ananorods 3aporosity 3asurface area 0aCovalent organic framework 0aParacetamol 0aHg2+ 0aElectrochemical sensor1 aYang, Yuxi1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3357-56071 aLiang, Huihui1 aWu, Na1 aPeng, Xia1 aWang, Li1 aSong, Yonghai1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7889-24380 tJournal of hazardous materials.g2021 May 05, v. 409 p.124528-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6200x0304-38947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2020.1245283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02691naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002000149245008300169300001600252520142800268592002801696650002101724650002001745650001101765650002001776650002401796650001501820650001901835650001601854650002601870650002301896650002001919650001601939650001801955650002301973650002401996650001102020650001602031650001102047773010702058856008302165852000902248655001202257IND60087030920221121221142.0141102e201106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008703092DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aspen.2010.09.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKiritani, Keizi10aImpacts of global warming on Nezara viridula and its native congeneric species  ap. 221-226.  aClimate change and biological invasion are two of the most important ecological issues. Nezara viridula (SGS) is a good example of an alien species that increased in response to recent land use changes and global warming. The range limit of SGS coincided with the 5°C isotherm of the mean monthly temperature for January. Since 2000, it has been warm enough for SGS to overwinter successfully outside its original range. Most invaded areas are now either occupied by SGS only or by mixed species of Nezara indicating that SGS is replacing its congeneric species, Nezara antennata, through interspecific mating. SGS population dynamics studies performed during 1961–1965 demonstrated that SGS abundance was density dependent and the independent processes worked alternately during the breeding season and winter. Although global warming would improve the winter survival of SGS adults, population density would be regulated at a new equilibrium specific to the area. Life tables demonstrated that all traits related to reproduction were poorly realized in the 2nd generation that occurs during summer. Heat stress syndrome due to global warming may be becoming apparent in SGS in spite of its subtropical origin. N. antennata may be able to avoid heat stress by aestivation. Whether SGS could continue to have a higher reproductive potential at the cost of heat stress over N. antennata is a significant ecological issue.  aPublisher supplied data 3aNezara antennata 3aNezara viridula 3aadults 3abreeding season 3aecological invasion 3aestivation 3aglobal warming 3aheat stress 3aheat stress disorders 3aintroduced species 3aland use change 3alife tables 3aoverwintering 3apopulation density 3apopulation dynamics 3asummer 3atemperature 3awinter0 tJournal of Asia-Pacific entomology.g2011 June, v. 14, no. 2 p.221-226dElsevier B.V.x1226-86157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aspen.2010.09.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01636naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002500148245011800173300001800291520054300309592002800852650002600880650001900906650001400925650001500939700002100954700002400975700002200999700002201021700002401043773011701067856008201184990002301266852000901289655001201298IND60090922320221120125448.0141102e20110801xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009092232DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bmcl.2011.06.0312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRodríguez, Oscar M.10aN-β-Glycosyl sulfamides are selective inhibitors of the cancer associated carbonic anhydrase isoforms IX and XII  ap. 4447-4450.  aThe transmembrane isoforms of carbonic anhydrase (CA IX and XII) have been shown to be linked to carcinogenesis and their inhibition to arrest primary tumor and metastases growth.

However, the phenomenon was suspected to be an error because the compression of layers is known to occur when subsidence occurs. A slice of the subsidence cone induced by drawdown was selected as the prototype. Model tests were performed to investigate the phenomenon. The underlying confined aquifer was generated as a movable rigid plate with a hinge at one end. The overlying layers were simulated with remolded materials collected from a construction site. Model tests performed under the conceptual model indicated that partial expansion occurred in stratified settlements under coordination deformation and consolidation conditions. During foundation pit dewatering, rapid drawdown resulted in rapid subsidence in the dewatered confined aquifer. The rapidly subsiding confined aquifer top was the bottom deformation boundary of the overlying layers. Non-coordination deformation was observed at the top and bottom of the subsiding overlying layers. The subsidence of overlying layers was larger at the bottom than at the top. The layers expanded and became thicker. The phenomenon was verified using numerical simulation method based on finite difference method. Compared with numerical simulation results, the boundary effect of the physical tests was obvious in the observation point close to the movable endpoint. The tensile stress of the overlying soil layers induced by the underlying settlement of dewatered confined aquifer contributed to the expansion phenomenon. The partial expansion of overlying soil layers was defined as inversed rebound. The inversed rebound was induced by inversed coordination deformation. Compression was induced by the consolidation in the overlying soil layers because of drainage. Partial expansion occurred when the expansion exceeded the compression. Considering the inversed rebound, traditional layer-wise summation method for calculating subsidence should be revised and improved.  aPublisher supplied data 3aconfined aquifer 3adeformation 3adewatering 3adrainage 3adrawdown 3amathematical models 3aprototypes 3asoil 3asubsidence 3atensile strength 0aFoundation pit dewatering 0aPartial expansion 0aModel test 0aCoordinated subsidence 0aConsolidation subsidence 0aNumerical verification1 aDeng, Yansheng1 aMa, Ruiqiang1 aLiu, Xiaotian1 aGuo, Qingfeng1 aLiu, Shaoli1 aShao, Yule1 aWu, Linbo1 aZhou, Jie1 aYang, Tianliang1 aWang, Hanmei1 aHuang, Xinlei0 tJournal of hydrology.g2018 Feb., v. 557 p.489-508dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl46539x0022-16947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2017.12.0463Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02210naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245007000168300001600238520138500254592002801639650001001667650001301677650001201690700002101702700002201723773009401745856008401839852000901923655001201932IND60084758420221119212250.0141101e201203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008475842DNAL7 a10.1016/j.beproc.2011.11.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChase, Sheila10aAttention, the presolution period, and choice accuracy in pigeons  ap. 225-231.  aSix pigeons were trained first on a color then on a form discrimination; four other pigeons were trained first on form and then on color. One of two colors or one of two forms (sample stimuli) appeared in the center of a touch sensitive monitor for 5 pigeons and in the center and in 16 other locations for 5 other pigeons. A peck anywhere within the region in which the sample stimuli appeared produced two white disks (comparison stimuli), one on the left and one on the lower right corners of the screen. Correct left–right choices provided food. Although of no consequence, the location of pecks in presence of the sample was predictive of the pigeon's subsequent choice. Accuracy, choice of the correct comparison stimulus, was greater when the sample stimuli appeared in the center as well as 16 other locations than when it appeared only in the center. The presolution period, the period of chance accuracy prior to evidence of discrimination learning, was decreased on each task following training on the other task. This evidence of facilitation following an extra-dimensional shift was attributed to continued relevance of the conditions under which the first task was learned. The duration of the presolution period was inversely related to asymptotic accuracy—data accounted for by Heinemann's (1983) theory of information processing during the presolution period.  aPublisher supplied data 3acolor 3alearning 3apigeons1 aSchupak, Cynthia1 aPloog, Bertram O.0 tBehavioural processes.g2012 Mar., v. 89, no. 3 p.225-231dElsevier B.V.x0376-63577nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.beproc.2011.11.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01900naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001600148245008000164300001600244520081500260592002801075650001501103650002001118650003101138650001001169650001201179650001301191653000801204653001301212653001601225653002301241653001501264653001201279653001801291700002001309773009401329856008201423852000901505655001201514IND60553702120221119200534.0161023e201505  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055370212DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tibs.2015.03.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGuil, Sonia10aRNA–RNA interactions in gene regulation: the coding and noncoding players  ap. 248-256.  aThe past few years have witnessed an exciting increase in the richness and complexity of RNA-mediated regulatory circuitries, including new types of RNA–RNA interaction that underlie key steps in gene expression control in an organized and probably hierarchic system to dictate final protein output. Both small (especially miRNAs) and long coding (lc) and noncoding (nc) RNAs contain structural domains that can sense and bind other RNAs via complementary base pairing. The versatility of the interaction confers multiple roles to RNA–RNA hybrids, from control of RNA biogenesis to competition for common targets. Here, we focus on the emerging evidence around RNA networks and their impact on gene expression regulation in light of recent breakthroughs around the crosstalk between coding RNAs and ncRNAs.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiogenesis 3agene expression 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3ahybrids 3amicroRNA 0aRNA 0amicroRNA 0ainteraction 0along noncoding RNA 0acoding RNA 0asponges 0acircular RNAs1 aEsteller, Manel0 tTrends in biochemical sciences.g2015 May, v. 40 p.248-256dElsevier Ltdx0968-00047nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tibs.2015.03.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01147naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002000149245009300169300001600262500001500278520020900293592002800502650001600530650001600546651001600562653001400578700002600592700002800618773010700646856008300753852000900836655001200845IND60087031320221122002036.0141102e201106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008703132DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aspen.2010.12.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJung, SungHoon,12aA new record of the infraorder Dipsocoromorpha (Hemiptera: Heteroptera) from South Korea  ap. 163-165.  a2019-12-06  aThe infraorder Dipsocoromorpha is recorded for the first time from South Korea based on specimens of Ceratocombus plebejus Poppius.

Young are born in seed-masting years, mostly in early August and there is a time constraint as they have to reach independence and sufficient body mass prior to hibernation into which they enter from late September to October. Given the seasonal time constraints, only one litter per year is known to occur in this rodent. Here we report on the timing of breeding in a Czech population of edible dormouse and on two proven cases when females produced two litters per season. Both cases concern very early breeding females which had lost their first litters prior to weaning. The second (replacement) litters were born late in the season and they were successfully weaned. We discuss that probably several factors like female condition, field research design or current phenological trends in extended growing seasons could lead to multiple breeding events in this species.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGlis glis 3abreeding 3afemales 3agrowing season 3ahibernation 3aphenology 3arodents 3asummer 3atemperate zones 3aweaning 0abreeding season 0afat dormouse 0amultiple breeding 0areproductive failure1 aAdamík, Peter,0 tFolia zoologica.g2016 July, v. 65, no. 2 p.165-168dInstitute of Vertebrate Biology, Academy of Sciences of the Czech RepublicwJournal:14572x0139-78937nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.25225/fozo.v65.i2.a12.20163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01554naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002000149245013400169300001600303500001500319520060300334592002800937650001400965650001600979650001400995650001401009651001601023653001401039773010701053856008301160852000901243655001201252IND60087031420221121232459.0141102e201106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008703142DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aspen.2010.12.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLee, Young June10aNew genus and two new species of Oncotympanina stat. nov.

DH substation operation is essential to bridging the gap between plants and thermal clients in achieving the intended DH values and visions. Therefore, in this study, an operation analysis method was developed for building-side DH substations. Specifically, Holistic Operational Signature (HOS) was suggested with multiple signature elements (x-OS) and representations to consider comprehensive operational correlations. A HOS-based analytics is proposed to provide more insights and sound reasoning about the DH substation design, operation, control, and heating efficiency potentials, compared with the existing Energy Signature. In a case study for winter, the proposed HOS method was applied to a target DH substation serving actual residential buildings using the real operational datasets. The six HOSs (HOSs 1–6) were derived with their six elements to identify the representative heating consumption levels and patterns, partial heating load ratios, and operation and control efficiency. Excessive water flow rates were identified based on the partial heating load elements (less than 50% in most cases) of all signatures. Inefficient signatures (HOSs 1–4) that do not follow the conventional control principle according to outdoor air temperatures were captured, especially for high heating demand patterns, which accounted for 72.5% of the total in winter. According to the signatures, the demand-based control can decrease the heating supply temperature setpoint by about 1.4 °C and 0.6 °C, respectively for HOS2 and the winter. It is recommended that the valve operation should be improved to lower the hunting levels (within ±1.5 °C) of heating water temperature control, especially in the afternoon with low heating demands.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3acase studies 3adata collection 3aenergy efficiency 3aheat 3arenewable energy sources 3awater flow 3awater temperature 3awinter 0aOperational signature 0aDistrict heating 0aDistrict heating substation 0aOperation analysis 0aEnergy consumption pattern 0aData mining1 aYoon, Sungmin1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7843-43680 tEnergy.g2022 July 01, v. 250 p.123798-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12436x0360-54427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2022.1237983Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03088naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100006200155245010600217300001400323520167300337592002802010650001202038650002202050650001702072650001402089650002702103650002602130650000902156650001502165650001102180650001302191650001102204650002302215651001202238653002002250653001002270653002502280653001202305653002302317653002302340700002702363700002002390773010902410856009002519852000902609655001202618IND60541352920221120080627.0190318e201509  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054135292DNAL7 a10.1016/j.landurbplan.2015.04.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMossman, Hannah L.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5958-532010aModelling biodiversity distribution in agricultural landscapes to support ecological network planning  ap. 59-67.  aStrategic approaches to biodiversity conservation increasingly emphasise the restoration of ecological connectivity at landscape scales. However, understanding where these connecting elements should be placed in the landscape is critical if they are to provide both value for money and for biodiversity. For such planning to be effective, it is necessary to have information of the distributions of multiple taxa, however, this is of poor quality for many taxa. We show that sparse, non-systematically collected biological records can be modelled using readily available environmental variables to meaningfully predict potential biodiversity richness, including rare and threatened species, across a landscape. Using a large database of ad-hoc biological records (50 501 records of 502 species) we modelled the richness of wetland biodiversity across the Fens, a formerly extensive wetland, now agricultural landscape in eastern England. We used these models to predict those parts of the agricultural ditch network of greatest potential conservation value and compared this to current strategic network planning. Odonata distribution differed to that of other groups, indicating that single taxon groups may not be effective proxies for other priority biodiversity. Our results challenged previous assumptions that river channels should comprise the main connecting elements in the Fens region. Rather, areas of high ditch density close to a main river are likely to be of greater value and should be targeted for enhancement. This approach can be adopted elsewhere in order to improve the evidence-base for strategic networks plans, increasing their value for money.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOdonata 3aagricultural land 3abiodiversity 3adatabases 3aecological restoration 3aenvironmental factors 3afens 3alandscapes 3amodels 3aplanning 3arivers 3athreatened species 3aEngland 0aCitizen science 0aDitch 0aHabitat connectivity 0aWetland 0aAgricultural ditch 0aDispersal corridor1 aPanter, Christopher J.1 aDolman, Paul M.0 tLandscape and urban planning.g2015 Sept., v. 141 p.59-67dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12405x0169-20467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.landurbplan.2015.04.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02463naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002600151245009100177500001400268500002200282520118500304592002801489650001701517650002301534650001201557650001701569650001501586650001201601650001401613650001101627650001001638653000801648653000801656653001801664653001401682653001501696653002701711653002001738653002901758700001501787700001601802773009301818856008501911852000901996655001202005IND60717357720221120221344.0201111e20200916xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071735772DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jeconom.2020.09.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAït-Sahalia, Yacine,10aMaximum likelihood estimation of latent Markov models using closed-form approximations  aNAL-light  aPre-press version  aThis paper proposes and implements an efficient and flexible method to compute maximum likelihood estimators of continuous-time models when part of the state vector is latent. Stochastic volatility and term structure models are typical examples. Existing methods integrate out the latent variables using either simulations as in MCMC, or replace the latent variables by observable proxies. By contrast, our approach relies on closed-form approximations to estimate parameters and simultaneously infer the distribution of filters, i.e., that of the latent states conditioning on observations. Without any particular assumption on the filtered distribution, we approximate in closed form a coupled iteration system for updating the likelihood function and filters based on the transition density of the state vector. Our procedure has a linear computational cost with respect to the number of observations, as opposed to the exponential cost implied by the high dimensional integral nature of the likelihood function. We establish the theoretical convergence of our method as the frequency of observation increases and conduct Monte Carlo simulations to demonstrate its performance.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMarkov chain 3aMonte Carlo method 3adensity 3aeconometrics 3aestimation 3afilters 3afrequency 3amodels 3apaper 0aC32 0aC58 0aMarkov vector 0aDiffusion 0aLikelihood 0aLatent state variables 0aIntegrating out 0aMarkov Chain Monte Carlo1 aLi, Chenxu1 aLi, Chen Xu0 tJournal of econometrics.g2020 Sept. 16, dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11871x0304-40767nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jeconom.2020.09.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03150naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245009700165506011700262506007600379520178300455592002802238506003702266650001502303650001102318650001902329650001502348650001802363650001702381653001702398653001602415653002002431700001302451700001502464700001802479700001902497700001502516773015202531856004802683852000902731655001202740IND60778106420221207113212.0220523e202109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077810642DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jag.2021.1023602doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Hongyan10aSoil salinity inversion based on differentiated fusion of satellite image and ground spectra  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aDue to the wide availability of remote sensing data from different sensors and platforms, soil salinity inversion based on the fusion of multisource remote sensing data is becoming a reality. However, existing fusion methods mainly use the average relationship from samples, which does not consider the differences in the relationships among samples. In this paper, a differentiated fusion method for determining satellite and ground spectral variables of soil salinity according to the differences among samples is proposed to increase the regional inversion precision. Nonnegative matrix factorization was employed to decompose soil salinity spectral variables from the Sentinel-2A Multi-Spectral Instrument (MSI) image and the simulated spectra on ground spectra. Then, the base spectra matrix of soil salinity was from the simulated data, and the weight coefficient matrix was obtained from the Sentinel-2A MSI data as the differentiated correction coefficients. By multiplying the base matrix and weight matrix, the spectral variables were reconstructed. The results indicate that this differentiated fusion method can not only enhance the correlation between soil salinity and Sentinel-2A MSI data but also improve the precision of regional soil salinity inversion models. For the differentiated fused model, the validation R², RMSE, and RPD were 0.71, 7.02 g/kg, and 1.49, respectively; compared with the unfused model, the validation R² increased by 0.09, the RMSE decreased by 0.80 g/kg, and the RPD increased by 0.18. Furthermore, the differentiated fused model performed better than the average-ratio adjusted model. These findings have practical implications for the use of multisource optical remote sensing data for regional soil salinity mapping and analysis.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aalgorithms 3amodels 3aremote sensing 3asatellites 3asoil salinity 3aspatial data 0aHyperspectra 0aData fusion 0aSentinel-2A MSI1 aMa, Ying1 aZhu, Axing1 aWang, Zhuoran1 aZhao, Gengxing1 aWei, Yanan0 tInternational journal of applied earth observation and geoinformation.g2021 Sept., v. 101 p.102360-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:21448x1569-84327nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jag.2021.102360  aDNAL 7aarticle02468naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245018000169300001400349520115700363592002801520650001901548650000901567650000901576650001201585650000901597650001201606650001601618650001501634650002601649650001301675651002101688653002201709653001701731653001601748700001701764700002201781773016201803856008401965852000902049655001202058IND60594445720221118081319.0180514e201607  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059444572DNAL7 a10.25225/fozo.v65.i2.a2.20162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKim, Hyeong-Su10aComparison of reproductive characteristics and host use of the Korean bitterling, Acheilognathus signifer (Cyprinidae, Pisces), between two populations in the wild environment  ap. 87-94.  aReproductive characteristics and host use of two populations of the Korean bitterling, Acheilognathus signifer, which uses mussels as a host, were investigated from April to July in 2011 and 2013. The study sites in Korea were Goesan, where A. signifer prefers Lamprotula leai to three other mussels as a host and Danyang, with a single mussel species, Unio douglasiae and therefore no host choice. The two populations of A. signifer did not show any differences in the appearance such as standard length of females during spawning season. However, the Goesan population had longer ovipositors (mean ± SD, 21.68 ± 2.84 vs. 19.33 ± 1.85) and a higher egg number (22.46 ± 12.31 vs. 17.16 ± 7.23) than the Danyang population. With regard to the host mussels that had A. signifer eggs, L. leai in Goesan had longer shells (57.24 ± 6.84 vs. 41.66 ± 4.88) and hosted more A. signifer eggs (11.10 ± 8.35 vs. 4.40 ± 5.30). We assume that the difference in ovipositor length and egg number of A. signifer between the two populations may be related to phenotypic plasticity required for oviposition to minimize egg ejection and maximize embryo survival.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAcheilognathus 3aUnio 3aeggs 3afemales 3afish 3amussels 3aoviposition 3aovipositor 3aphenotypic plasticity 3aspawning 3aKorean Peninsula 0afreshwater mussel 0aegg position 0acoevolution1 aKo, Jae-Geun1 aPak, Chong-yŏng,0 tFolia zoologica.g2016 July, v. 65, no. 2 p.87-94dInstitute of Vertebrate Biology, Academy of Sciences of the Czech RepublicwJournal:14572x0139-78937nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.25225/fozo.v65.i2.a2.20163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01957naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002200148245005800170300001600228520090000244592002801144650001501172650001501187650001401202650001901216650001401235653000901249653001401258653002401272653001401296653001001310653001201320700001901332700001601351700001901367773009401386856008201480852000901562655001201571IND60553702320221119200524.0161023e201505  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055370232DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tibs.2015.03.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFeuerhahn, Sascha10aNo DDRama at chromosome ends: TRF2 takes centre stage  ap. 275-285.  aTelomeres are nucleoprotein structures capping the natural termini of eukaryotic linear chromosomes. Telomeres possess an inherent ability to circumvent the activation of a full-blown DNA damage response (DDR), and hence fusion reactions, by limiting inappropriate double-strand break (DSB) repair and processing activities at eukaryotic chromosome ends. A telomere-specific protein complex, termed shelterin, has a crucial function in safeguarding and securing telomere integrity. Within this complex, TRF2 has emerged as the key player, dictating different states of telomere protection during the replicative lifespan of a cell. How TRF2 prevents activation of DSB repair activities at functional telomeres has now been extensively investigated. In this review we aim at exploring the complex and multi-faceted mechanisms underlying the TRF2-mediated protection of eukaryotic chromosome ends.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA damage 3aDNA repair 3alongevity 3anucleoproteins 3atelomeres 0aTRF2 0atelomeres 0aDNA damage response 0achromatin 0aTERRA 0at-loops1 aChen, Liuh-yow1 aLuke, Brian1 aPorro, Antonio0 tTrends in biochemical sciences.g2015 May, v. 40 p.275-285dElsevier Ltdx0968-00047nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tibs.2015.03.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02631naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245008400168300001200252520130700264592002801571650001501599650002301614650002801637650001701665650001901682650001301701650001301714650001701727650001701744650001701761650001701778650001301795650002201808650004301830650001501873650001201888650001101900700003101911700001901942773013401961856008102095852000902176655001202185IND60569707220221119213026.0170725e201612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056970722DNAL7 a10.1007/s10661-016-5678-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHabibipour, Reza10aMonitoring of aflatoxin G1, B1, G2, and B2 occurrence in some samples of walnut  ap. 669.  aThis research was conducted to monitor the aflatoxigenic fungi and aflatoxin contamination of walnut in the Hamedan province. For this purpose, 40 samples were analyzed. Aspergillus, Alternaria, Rhizopus, Cladosporium, Fusarium, yeast, and some different bacteria were isolated from walnuts. Aspergillus is the most frequent genus. Aspergillus flavus was predominantly isolated. HPLC was used for evaluation of aflatoxin contamination of walnut samples. Aflatoxins G1 (AFG1), B1 (AFB1), G2 (AFG2), and B2 (AFB2) were produced by 20 isolates. AFG1 and AFB1 were being predominant at concentration ranges of 1.7–18.2 and 0–8.2 ngg⁻¹, respectively. Highest levels were found in one sample that was highly contaminated with Aspergillus flavus/Aspergillus parasiticus. Methyl beta cyclodextrin also was performed for detection of aflatoxigenic Aspergillus isolates. The results showed that only 31.6% (p < 0.05) of A. flavus and A. parasiticus isolates were able to produce aflatoxin. A significant difference was shown between shielded and unshielded walnut in aflatoxin contamination. The content of aflatoxin in most of the walnut samples did not reach to maximum tolerable limit for aflatoxin B1 in EU standard (p > 0.05). Thus, systematic and continues monitoring of walnuts is recommended.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAlternaria 3aAspergillus flavus 3aAspergillus parasiticus 3aCladosporium 3aEuropean Union 3aFusarium 3aRhizopus 3aaflatoxin B1 3aaflatoxin B2 3aaflatoxin G1 3aaflatoxin G2 3abacteria 3abeta-cyclodextrin 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3amonitoring 3awalnuts 3ayeasts1 aTamandegani, Parisa Rahimi1 aFarmany, Abbas0 tEnvironmental monitoring and assessment.g2016 Dec., v. 188, no. 12 p.669-669dSpringer International Publishingx0167-63697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-016-5678-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02582naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245011000169520141600279592002801695650001701723650001101740650001601751650000801767650001201775650002901787650001601816650001901832653002401851653001701875653000801892653001901900700001701919700005801936700001801994773009002012856008502102852000902187655001202196IND60770812620221119113933.0220824e20220701xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077081262DNAL7 a10.1016/j.energy.2022.1238012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSong, Yongchen10aThermodynamics analysis and ice behavior during the depressurization process of methane hydrate reservoir  aAs potential alternative energy sources, natural gas hydrate has attracted international attentions. In order to optimize its exploitation process, the thermodynamics characteristics during hydrate dissociation were investigated in this study. Eleven reservoirs with three ratios of gas amounts in gas and hydrate phases (2.1, 2.9 and 4.6) were employed, and four exhaust rates (2.3, 4.7, 7.1 and 8.8 ln/min) were conducted to pressurize the reservoirs to 2.0 MPa. Hydrates dissociated at a constant rate during the depressurization stage, and the dissociation rate increased with higher depressurization rate, while the effect is enhancing with the increase of gas space. The temperature decreased with the dropped pressure in a similar trend, affected by both depressurization rate and hydrate saturation. During constant-pressure stage, the hydrate-bearing reservoir temperature kept at approximately −2.5 °C until ice formation, making the temperature increase to −1.5 °C. Ice formation can nearly quintuple the instantaneous rate of hydrate dissociation, while no obvious changes in hydrate dissociation before and after the end of ice melting. In addition, the induction time and existence duration of ice obey good stepwise spatial and temporal sequences. These results are great significant for pressure controlling and efficiency optimization of later period of methane hydrate exploitation.  aPublisher supplied data 3adissociation 3aenergy 3agas hydrate 3aice 3amethane 3arenewable energy sources 3atemperature 3athermodynamics 0aNatural gas hydrate 0aExploitation 0aIce 0aThermodynamics1 aTian, Mengru1 aZheng, Jia-nan1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4022-30171 aYang, Mingjun0 tEnergy.g2022 July 01, v. 250 p.123801-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12436x0360-54427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2022.1238013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01599naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094024002200130024001900152040001800171100002300189245004000212300001600252506007600268520048100344592002800825506003700853650002100890650001900911650000800930653000900938653002000947653001200967653001000979653000900989653000900998700002101007773009401028856008201122852000901204655001201213IND60553702420221207104203.0161023e201505  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055370242DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tibs.2015.03.0042doi7 aPMC44082522pmcid7 a258010532pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLuciano, Daniel J.10aNAD in RNA: unconventional headgear  ap. 245-247.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aAlthough widely assumed to bear a 5′-terminal triphosphate or monophosphate, recent evidence suggests that the 5′ end of bacterial RNA can sometimes bear a modification reminiscent of a eukaryotic cap.

By conducting an intense island-wide survey, we examined different cycad morphospecies in Sri Lanka, studied their vegetative and female reproductive morphological features, and analyzed genetic variation using two plastid markers (trnH-psbA and trnSᴳᵁC-trnGᵁCC) and one nuclear marker (ITS), together with cycad DNA sequence data already available in GenBank®, in order to delimit Sri Lankan Cycas taxa and to reveal their evolutionary relationships. Combined analysis of both morphological and DNA sequence data resolved Sri Lankan cycads into three species as C. circinalis and C. nathorstii (subsection Cycas), and C. zeylanica (subsection Rumphiae). The results revealed the presence of C. circinalis in Sri Lanka for the first time, which was previously reported as endemic to India. Differentiating C. circinalis from C. nathorstii is rather difficult if only morphological or genetic variation is considered, and this could be due to strong phylogenetic affinities that exist between these two species. Further, the combined analysis clearly identified enigmatic intermediate individuals in the population which possessed mixed morphological and genetic features of the two species of the subsection Cycas. We propose to implement combined analysis of both morphological and DNA sequence (both plastid and nuclear) data as a better approach in discriminating closely related cycad taxa, and in identifying enigmatic intermediate individuals in the population, compared to analysis of each data type separately.  aPublisher supplied data 3afemales 3aflora 3agenetic variation 3amorphospecies 3aphylogeny 3asurveys 3aIndia 3aSri Lanka 0aCycas 0aPhylogenetic 0anrITS 0aRumphiae 0aSri Lanka1 aRanaweera, Lahiru1 aJayarathne, Hashan1 aSamaraweera, Preminda1 aSooriyapathirana, Suneth1 aPerera, Anoma1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9030-01350 tFlora.g2022 May, v. 290 p.152044-dElsevier GmbHwJournal:jnl51878x0367-25307nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.flora.2022.1520443Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02127naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001500148245018300163300001800346520056000364592002800924650001200952650001500964650001900979650004300998700001401041700001801055700001601073700001501089700001501104700001701119700001701136700001201153700001401165700001401179700001701193700001801210700001601228700002001244700001801264700001701282700002101299700002401320700001601344700001801360773011701378856008201495990002301577852000901600655001201609IND60090922820221120125532.0141102e20110801xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009092282DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bmcl.2011.06.0322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXu, Baihua10aC-Aryl glucosides substituted at the 4′-position as potent and selective renal sodium-dependent glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors for the treatment of type 2 diabetes  ap. 4465-4470.  aA series of C-aryl glucosides with various substituents at the 4′-position of the distal aryl ring have been synthesized and evaluated for inhibition of hSGLT1 and hSGLT2.

The potential protective role of Ziziphus spina-christi leaf extract (ZSCLE) against testicular impairments associated with mercury chloride (HgCl₂) exposure in rats was investigated in the current study. Four experimental groups were employed as follows (n = 7): group I served as control, group II was gavaged with ZSCLE (300 mg/kg), group III was administered with HgCl₂ (0.4 mg/kg), and group IV was preadministered with ZSCLE 1 h before HgCl₂. All groups were treated daily for 28 days. The exposure to HgCl₂ caused a marked increase in Hg concentration in the testicular tissue, which was accompanied with a decrease in testis index. A reproductive impairment was recorded following HgCl₂ exposure as verified through the decrease in levels of testosterone, luteinizing, and follicle-stimulating hormones. HgCl₂ was found to enhance the development of oxidative damage in the testicular tissue as presented by the imbalance between pro-oxidants and antioxidant molecules. In addition, excessive release of tumor necrosis factor-α and interleukin-1β was recorded in response to HgCl₂ intoxication. Furthermore, a disturbance in the apoptotic proteins in favor of the pro-apoptotic proteins was also observed following HgCl₂ intoxication. However, ZSCLE administration along with HgCl₂ abolished significantly the molecular, biochemical, and histopathological alterations induced by HgCl₂ intoxication. Our findings suggest that ZSCLE could be used to mitigate reproductive dysfunction associated with HgCl₂ exposure.  aPublisher supplied data  aResearch Supporting Project number: RSP-2019/96cKing Saud University 3aZiziphus spina-christi 3aadverse effects 3aantioxidants 3aapoptosis 3aheavy metals 3ahistopathology 3ainterleukin-1beta 3aleaf extracts 3aluteinization 3amercuric chloride 3amercury 3apoisoning 3apro-apoptotic proteins 3aprotective effect 3aproteins 3arats 3atestes 3atestosterone 3atumor necrosis factor-alpha1 aAlbasher, Gadah1 aKassab, Rami B.1 aIbrahim, Shaimaa R.1 aAlotibi, Fatimah1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3629-57551 aAlarifi, Saud1 aAli, Daoud1 aAlkahtani, Saad1 aAbdel Moneim, Ahmed E.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2654-25910 tEnvironmental science and pollution research international.g2020 Jan., v. 27, no. 3 p.3401-3412dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl4122550x0944-13447nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-019-07237-w3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03192naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001800152245007200170300001400242520185000256592002802106650002302134650001402157650001702171650000902188650001102197650001402208650001802222650001502240650002002255650001402275650001402289650002302303650001602326650001502342650000902357653001402366653001302380653002602393653001702419700001702436700001802453773015602471856008602627852000902713655001202722IND60721397420221119083214.0201224e201901  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072139742DNAL7 a10.5958/0973-9149.2019.00002.92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShodhan, K.V.10aAutophagy: A New Version of Ancient Indian Health Management System  ap. 10-18.  aAutophagy is a lysosome involved degradation system by which the cytoplasmic components of the cells are recycled. In response to acute stress like starvation and exercise, autophagy is activated. It degrades organelles and proteins to provide energy and metabolites for its pro-survival effects. These degraded organelles include longlived and malformed proteins, organelles damaged during biosynthesis. Thus, it helps to rejuvenate organs and clear out the junk and toxins that builds up, proving to have beneficial effects on the health. Thus, channelling this innate process of cleansing for maximal health benefits is necessary, without overdoing it which otherwise may cause unnecessary stress. This autophagy can be regulated by various therapies like drugs and daily routine activities. While many drugs target these pathways, we can control them naturally through diet and exercise. Indian System of Health Management advocates an ideal lifestyle which is applicable for all culture and geography through which autophagy can be regulated. Ayurveda with its objective ‘Swasthya Rakshanam’ meaning maintenance of health emphasises the importance of good lifestyle. These systems contain various daily routine practices to help in inducing autophagy in the body which helps in rejuvenate body organs. They provide us with a stimulus for autophagy to create more beneficial cellular components (like in our immune system) or a stimulus to remove more harmful ones (like faulty cells and cancer). These include methods like fasting (upavasam) in Ayurveda, and yoga techniques mainly Shatkarma which include neti, kunjalkriya, agnisar, nauli, kapalabhati, tratak and shankaprakshalana. Thus, now we can add autophagy in the long list of health benefits and use different system of Indian medicine in regulating it for our health benefits.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAyurvedic medicine 3aautophagy 3abiosynthesis 3adiet 3aenergy 3ageography 3aimmune system 3aimmunology 3aimmunopathology 3alifestyle 3alysosomes 3amanagement systems 3ametabolites 3astarvation 3ayoga 0aTherapies 0aAyurveda 0aProgrammed cell death 0aBody defence1 aMewari, N.S.1 aChauhan, R.S.0 tJournal of immunology and immunopathology.g2019 Jan., v. 21, no. 1 p.10-18dSociety for Immunology and ImmunopathologywJournal:27363x0973-91497nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.5958/0973-9149.2019.00002.93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02608naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001700139245016800156300001600324520164400340592002801984650001702012650002502029650002102054650001402075650000902089700002902098700002502127773010502152856004002257852000902297655001202306IND50067788420221118014700.0130712e201308  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006778842DNAL7 a10.1111/een.120212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHAWES, CATHY10aInterference competition, not predation, explains the negative association between wood ants (Formica rufa) and abundance of ground beetles (Coleoptera: Carabidae)  ap. 315-322.  aIntraguild interactions between predators have significant implications for how multiple predators impact on their prey. Carabid assemblages are not generally thought to be structured by interspecific competitive interactions, species relative abundances instead being determined mainly by abiotic factors. However, several field studies report negative associations between the abundance of certain carabid species and the presence of wood ants. Replicated laboratory experiments were used to monitor the behaviour of individual female Abax parallelepipedus (Piller & Mitterpacher) in the presence of a range of wood ant (Formica rufa L.) densities (including ant‐free controls) over 23 h. Carabids did not feed when wood ants were present. Running and defence activities were high at low ant densities but decreased with increasing ant density. At the highest ant density, all carabids were killed within the first 2 h of the experiment, but the ants did not consume the carabids after they had killed them. Carabid diurnal activity increased at the higher wood ant densities. Female A. parallelepipedus and Pterostichus madidus (F.) maintained individually in the presence of five wood ants had significantly lower mean body weights and carried fewer eggs after 21 days compared to control beetles that had been kept without ants. The results help to explain the reduced abundance of these two carabid species under field conditions when wood ants are present. We interpret these findings to mean that the interaction between wood ants and carabids is one of asymmetric aggressive interference competition rather than predation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFormica rufa 3aPterostichus madidus 3adiurnal activity 3apredation 3awood1 aEvans, H.

The mechanism of electromagnetic wave loading on the releasing of bound water before sludge flocculation dewatering was investigated through observing the changes of extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) composition, surface charge, and particle size distribution. The results showed that the 8.55 g/g total suspended solids (TSS) of bound water was reduced with 160 J/mL electromagnetic wave, and the moisture content of sludge decreased by 3.02%. The EPS structure in the sludge floc matrix was destroyed and the LB-EPS content reduced. Simultaneously, infrared spectrum analysis indicated that bound water content was correlated both to the changes of hydrophilic and hydrophobic functional groups. Moreover, protein secondary structure analysis found that looser protein structure facilitated the exposure of internal hydrophobic groups and further promoted the sludge hydrophobic properties. Additionally, electromagnetic wave disintegrated colloidal stability through dipole motion. The zeta potential increased from − 25.57 to − 14.32 mV; the medium particle size (d₀.₅) decreased from 119.99 to 80.41 μm. More small molecules created in the supernatant were helpful to release bound water, which could further improve flocculation dewaterability of sludge with electromagnetic wave loading.  aPublisher supplied data  a51108360cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a51208397cNational Natural Science Foundation of China 3abound water 3adewatering 3aelectromagnetic radiation 3aflocculation 3ahydrophilicity 3ahydrophobicity 3amoieties 3aparticle size 3aparticle size distribution 3apolymers 3aprotein secondary structure 3asludge 3atotal suspended solids 3azeta potential1 aLi, Xiaoyang1 aFeng, Yijie1 aZhang, Qian1 aLi, Dong0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research international.g2020 Jan., v. 27, no. 3 p.3413-3427dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl4122550x0944-13447nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-019-07141-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02616naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245008300166300001600249520130900265592002801574596004101602650001601643650002101659650001201680650001001692650001601702650002001718650001501738650001101753650001501764650001301779650002001792650001401812650001501826650002101841650001501862650001401877650001001891650001501901700002301916773012801939856008202067852000902149655001202158IND60591344920221119194950.0181018e201802  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059134492DNAL7 a10.1007/s10811-017-1266-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPiltz, Bastian10aImmobilized microalgae for nutrient recovery from source-separated human urine  ap. 421-429.  aShortages in nutrients and freshwater for a growing population are critical global issues. Source separation of waste streams combined with decentralized resource recovery is a promising approach to address this problem. Urine contains within 1% of household wastewater up to 80% of nitrogen (N) and 50% of phosphorus (P). Since microalgae are efficient at nutrient uptake, growing them in urine is a promising technology to clean urine and produce biomass as fertilizer. The aim of this study was to develop a process for nutrient recovery from minimally diluted human urine using immobilized cultivation of microalgae on porous substrate photobioreactors (PSBRs). Treatment of urine, unamended except for a 1:1 dilution with tap water, was performed with the green alga Desmodesmus abundans, chosen among 96 algal strains derived from urine-specific enrichments and culture collections.

Given the relationship between wind power and wind speed, precise prediction of wind speed for wind energy estimation and wind power generation is important. For proper and efficient evaluation of wind speed, a smooth transition periodic autoregressive (STPAR) model is developed to predict the six-hourly wind speeds. In addition, the Elman artificial neural network (EANN)-based error correction technique has also been integrated into the new STPAR model to improve model performance. To verify the developed approach, the six-hourly wind speed series during the period of 2000–2009 in the Hebei region of China is used for model construction and model testing. The proposed EANN-STPAR hybrid model has demonstrated its powerful forecasting capacity for wind speed series with complicated characteristics of linearity, seasonality and nonlinearity, which indicates that the proposed hybrid model is notably efficient and practical for wind speed forecasting, especially for the Hebei wind farms of China.  aPublisher supplied data 3aenvironmental protection 3amodel validation 3aneural networks 3apower generation 3aprediction 3awind farms 3awind power 3awind speed 3aChina 0aElman artificial neural network (EANN) 0aerror correction 0asmooth transition periodic autoregressive (STPAR) 0awind energy 0awind speed forecasting1 aWang, Jianzhou1 aWu, Jie1 aZhao, Ge0 tInternational journal of green energy.g2016 May 2, v. 13, no. 6 p.595-607dTaylor & Francisx1543-50837nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15435075.2014.9614623Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02094naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001900149245011100168300001800279520093200297592002801229650002801257650002301285650001601308650002101324650001501345650001201360650002201372650001201394650001001406650002301416651003301439700001801472700002201490700001801512773008601530856008301616852000901699655001201708IND60096756420221120155932.0141104e201105  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009675642DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enpol.2011.02.0232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMcNair, Ben J.10aHouseholds' willingness to pay for overhead-to-underground conversion of electricity distribution networks  ap. 2560-2567.  aUnderground low-voltage electricity networks have several advantages over overhead networks including reliability of supply, safety and improved visual amenity. The economic viability of replacing existing overhead networks with new underground networks depends on the value of these benefits to households, but no complete value estimates are available in the literature. This paper represents a contribution towards addressing this research gap. A stated choice survey is used to estimate willingness to pay for undergrounding in established residential areas in Canberra, Australia. Average willingness to pay is at least A$6838 per household and there is significant variation in preferences over the population. The results suggest that benefits would be highest in areas with higher household income and older residents where visual amenity, safety, tree trimming, or restrictions on the use of yard space are of concern.  aPublisher supplied data 3aeconomic sustainability 3aelectric utilities 3aelectricity 3ahousehold income 3ahouseholds 3apruning 3aresidential areas 3asurveys 3atrees 3awillingness to pay 3aAustralian Capital Territory1 aBennett, Jeff1 aHensher, David A.1 aRose, John M.0 tEnergy policy.g2011 May, v. 39, no. 5 p.2560-2567dElsevier Ltdx0301-42157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enpol.2011.02.0233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02980naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100002100166245011100187300001600298520118000314592002801494650002501522650000901547650001601556650001501572650002201587650001101609650001901620650002201639650001301661650001301674650001501687650002001702650001301722650001701735650004001752650001201792650002101804650004201825650004201867650003001909650004801939650003501987650004502022650002402067650002902091700002202120700001902142700002002161700002002181700002502201773010702226856004802333852000902381655001202390IND50072269420221117232518.0140125e201402  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007226942DNAL7 a240577582pmid7 a10.1007/s10695-013-9855-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTerova, Genciana10aProteomic profiling of sea bass muscle by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and tandem mass spectrometry  ap. 311-322.  aIn this study, the proteome profile of European sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrax) muscle was analyzed using two-dimensional electrophoresis (2-DE) and tandem mass spectrometry with the aim of providing a more detailed characterization of its specific protein expression profile. A highly populated and well-resolved 2-DE map of the sea bass muscle tissue was generated, and the corresponding protein identity was provided for a total of 49 abundant protein spots. Upon Ingenuity Pathway Analysis, the proteins mapped in the sea bass muscle profile were mostly related to glycolysis and to the muscle myofibril structure, together with other biological activities crucial to fish muscle metabolism and contraction, and therefore to fish locomotor performance. The data presented in this work provide important and novel information on the sea bass muscle tissue-specific protein expression, which can be useful for future studies aimed to improve seafood traceability, food safety/risk management and authentication analysis.

Nevertheless, the knowledge of the nutritional value of wild growing mushrooms is limited. The present study reports the effects of trophism on mushrooms nutritional and nutraceutical potential. In vitro antioxidant properties of five saprotrophic (Calvatia utriformis, Clitopilus prunulus, Lycoperdon echinatum, Lyophyllum decastes, and Macrolepiota excoriata) and five mycorrhizal (Boletus erythropus, Boletus fragrans, Hygrophorus pustulatus, Russula cyanoxantha, and Russula olivacea) wild edible mushrooms were accessed and compared to individual compounds identified by chromatographic techniques. Mycorrhizal species revealed higher sugars concentration (16â42g/100g dw) than the saprotrophic mushrooms (0.4â15g/100g). Furthermore, fructose was found only in mycorrhizal species (0.2â2g/100g). The saprotrophic L. decastes, and the mycorrhizal species B. erythropus and B. fragrans gave the highest antioxidant potential, mainly due to the contribution of polar antioxidants such as phenolics and sugars. The bioactive compounds found in wild mushrooms give scientific evidence to traditional edible and medicinal uses of these species.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBoletus fragrans 3aCalvatia 3aClitopilus 3aHygrophorus 3aLycoperdon 3aLyophyllum 3aMacrolepiota 3aRussula cyanoxantha 3aantioxidant activity 3aantioxidants 3achromatography 3afructose 3aingestion 3amushroom growing 3amushrooms 3anutrition 3anutritive value1 aHeleno, Sandrina A.1 aBarros, Lillian1 aMartins, Anabela1 aFerreira, Isabel C.F.R.0 tFood research international.g2011 May, v. 44, no. 4 p.1029-1035dElsevier Ltdx0963-99697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodres.2011.03.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02270naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100005700153245006300210300002000273500001900293520129800312592002801610650001501638650001901653650000901672650001101681700001601692700001801708700001201726773012201738856008701860852000901947655001201956IND60718100120221121184757.0201119e20201008xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071810012DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.energyfuels.0c027612doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDuan, Lijiang1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4818-970612aA Comprehensive Explanation to CO₂-induced Coal Swelling  ap. 14458-14463.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aAfter exposing dry high-volatile bituminous coal, low-volatile bituminous coal, and anthracite to CO₂, we measured the swelling properties of the coal in two pressurization cycles with a maximum pressure of 12 MPa. The viewpoint of physicochemical interactions between the coal and CO₂ was used to explain these observations for the first time. Due to the irreversibility of the chemical interactions, the swelling process is also irreversible. At medium to high pressures, the compressional environment is stronger than the magnitude of the swelling; as such, the maximum swelling occurs at 10 MPa. The magnitude of the swelling increases with the coal rank, indicating more drastic breakage of the associative bonds in the coal macromolecule. We attribute anisotropic swelling to the anisotropic bond density in the directions perpendicular and parallel to the bedding plane. In the second pressurization cycle, more gases enter the coal macromolecule at the same pressure, which cause higher strains than those of the first run. The swelling anisotropy slightly weakens in the second pressurization run because the expansion perpendicular to the bedding plane is mitigated. Since the coal rearranges to a more homogeneous structure, the anisotropic swelling is obvious at all pressures.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanisotropy 3acarbon dioxide 3acoal 3aenergy1 aXia, Tianyu1 aQu, Liangchao1 aYi, Jie0 tEnergy & fuels.g2020 Oct. 08, v. 34, no. 11 p.14458-14463dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23338x1520-50297nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.energyfuels.0c027613Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02830naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002100149245009500170300001400265520159600279592002801875650001101903650001701914650001401931650001401945650002801959650001501987650001602002650002102018650000802039650001102047653003902058653002602097653001702123653002402140653001502164700002102179700001502200773010102215856008302316852000902399655001202408IND60599611620221120155703.0180702e201406  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059961162DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cageo.2014.03.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRühaak, Wolfram10a3D hydro-mechanically coupled groundwater flow modelling of Pleistocene glaciation effects  ap. 89-99.  aPleistocene glaciation led to temporal and spatial variations of sub-surface pore fluid pressure. In basins covered by ice sheets, fluid flow and recharge rates are strongly elevated during glaciations as compared to inter-glacial periods. Present-day hydrogeological conditions across formerly glaciated areas are likely to still reflect the impact of glaciations that ended locally more than 10 thousand years before present.3D hydro-mechanical coupled modelling of glaciation can help to improve the management of groundwater resources in formerly glaciated basins.An open source numerical code for solving linear elasticity, which is based on the finite element method (FEM) in 3D, has been developed. By coupling this code with existing 3D flow codes it is possible to enable hydro-mechanical coupled modelling.Results of two benchmark simulations are compared to existing analytical solutions to demonstrate the performance of the newly developed code. While the result for a fluid–structure coupled case is in reasonable agreement with the analytical model, the result for a classical structure–fluid coupled benchmark showed that the analytical solution only matches the numerical result when the relevant coupling parameter (loading efficiency) is known in advance. This indicates that the applicability of widely applied approaches using an extra term in the groundwater flow equation for vertical stress to simulate hydro-mechanical coupling might have to be re-evaluated.A case study with the commercial groundwater simulator FEFLOW demonstrates the newly developed solution.  aPublisher supplied data 3abasins 3acase studies 3acomputers 3aequations 3afinite element analysis 3aglaciation 3agroundwater 3agroundwater flow 3aice 3amodels 0aHydro-mechanical coupled modelling 0aFinite element method 0aPorous media 0aNumerical modelling 0aGlaciation1 aBense, Victor F.1 aSass, Ingo0 tComputers & geosciences.g2014 June, v. 67 p.89-99dElsevier LtdwJournal:12438x0098-30047nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cageo.2014.03.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02862naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245012200167300001400289520147700303592002801780650002201808650001501830650001101845650001901856650001901875650001901894650001101913650001501924650001901939650002301958650001401981650001301995650002002008700002802028700002402056700002202080700001902102700002902121700001902150700001802169773012602187856008202313852000902395655001202404IND60591345020221119193305.0181018e201802  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059134502DNAL7 a10.1007/s10811-017-1156-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aManrique, Robby10aEffects of salinity on the CO2 permeation across lipid bilayer for microalgae biofixation: a molecular dynamics study  ap. 55-61.  aThe continuous threat of increasing CO₂ concentration in the atmosphere has altered the carbon balance of our planet causing global climate change. Biological fixation of atmospheric CO₂ by unicellular microorganisms such as microalgae is a promising technology pursued extensively by researchers as a means for carbon capture. The study aimed to provide an atomic level of study that will demonstrate the effect of the salinity on the mechanism of CO₂ absorption across microalgae lipid bilayer. Molecular dynamics simulations were utilized to calculate the free energies of CO₂ molecule as it permeates inside the microalgae cell. In thermodynamics, the transport process of a molecule can be demonstrated through its free energy gradient. Thus, calculating the free energies of CO₂ molecule across microalgae lipid bilayer can elucidate the mechanisms of permeation processes. Four microalgae lipid bilayer structures were constructed that contains 128-DPPC (dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine) lipid bilayer with 3640 water molecules with different NaCl concentrations: 0, 3, 13, and 19 NaCl molecules which correspond to a salinity level of 0, 50, 200, and 300 mM, respectively. The cavity insertion Widom method was used to calculate the free energy of CO₂ molecule along the lipid bilayer. The results demonstrated that the salinity does not affect the free energies significantly, thus, it does not hamper CO₂ transport across microalgae lipid membrane.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGibbs free energy 3aabsorption 3acarbon 3acarbon dioxide 3aclimate change 3alipid bilayers 3alipids 3amicroalgae 3amicroorganisms 3amolecular dynamics 3apermeates 3asalinity 3asodium chloride1 aMoreno, Joaquin Lorenzo1 aVillagracia, Al Rey1 aUbando, Aristotle1 aKasai, Hideaki1 aArboleda, Nelson, JrcJr1 aDavid, Melanie1 aCulaba, Alvin0 tJournal of applied phycology.g2018 Feb., v. 30, no. 1 p.55-61dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl3870059x0921-89717nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10811-017-1156-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04372naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002300143245007500166300001100241520305100252592002803303650002503331650001003356650001203366650001503378650001103393650001203404650001103416650002003427650001803447650001203465650001503477650001103492650001503503650001503518650002303533650001903556650002003575650001503595650001203610650001303622651001103635700001803646700002003664700003003684773009903714856004403813852000903857655001203866IND50065260920221119195333.0140123e201312  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006526092DNAL7 a10.1186/2048-7010-2-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTuryahabwe, Nelson10aContribution of wetland resources to household food security in Uganda  ap. 34.  aBACKGROUND: In Uganda, nearly 1.4 million people are currently food insecure, with the prevalence of food energy deficiency at the country level standing at 37%. Local farmers are vulnerable to starvation in times of environmental stress, drought and floods because of dependence on rain-fed agriculture. Accordingly, the farmer’s means of increasing food production has always been an expansion of area under cultivation from virgin and fragile areas, especially wetlands. Consequently, Uganda has lost about 11,268 km² of wetland, representing a loss of 30% of the country’s wetlands from 1994 to 2009. While the environmental importance of wetland ecosystems is widely recognized, their contribution to household food security is still hardly explored. In this paper an assessment of the contribution of wetland resources to household food security and factors influencing use of wetland resources in Uganda are reported. METHODS: A number of livelihood tools in food security assessment including focus group discussions, key informant interviews, direct observations and a household questionnaire survey, were used to collect the data. A total of 247 respondents from areas adjacent to wetlands were involved in the household questionnaire survey conducted in three agro-ecological zones that are frequently characterized as food insecure. RESULTS: The findings indicate that about 83% of the households experienced food insecurity. The main indicators of food insecurity were low harvest (30.9%) and when people buy locally grown food items (18%). Most households felt food secure when they had perennial crops (43.2%) in their gardens, or adequate money to buy food (23.9%). The prevalence of food insecurity was significantly lower among households with older and better educated household heads, but also among households located in Lake Victoria Crescent and South western farmlands agro-ecological zones, but significantly higher among households that were female headed, larger and participate in collection of wetland resources. Over 80% of the respondents reported that wetland resources provide products and services that contribute enormously to their household food security. Besides, they also indirectly contribute to food security by providing services that foster food production such as weather modifications and nutrient retention. Households with older heads and those that reside in the Lake Victoria Crescent agro-ecological zone when compared to counterparts in the Lake Kyoga agro-ecological zone are more likely to have a higher dependence on wetlands for food security. CONCLUSIONS: With increasing population around the wetlands, coupled with land shortage and weather variations, households with limited options will continue to generally rely on wetlands for food security and income for sustaining their livelihoods unless alternative livelihood options are provided. There is thus a need to design appropriate food production technologies that ensure sustainable use of wetland resources for food security.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagroecological zones 3acrops 3adrought 3aecosystems 3aenergy 3afarmers 3afloods 3afood production 3afood security 3agardens 3ahouseholds 3aincome 3ainterviews 3alivelihood 3anutrient retention 3aquestionnaires 3arainfed farming 3astarvation 3asurveys 3awetlands 3aUganda1 aKakuru, Willy1 aTweheyo, Mnason1 aTumusiime, David Mwesigye0 tAgriculture & food security.g2013 Dec., v. 2, no. 1 p.34-34dSpringer-Verlagx2048-70107nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1186/2048-7010-2-5  aDNAL 7aarticle02474naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002400149245009500173300001400268520139700282592002801679650001501707650002401722650002201746650001401768650001401782650001901796650001101815653002401826653001901850653001001869653002101879700001901900773010101919856008302020852000902103655001202112IND60599611820221120145614.0180702e201406  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059961182DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cageo.2014.03.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKetcham, Richard A.10aBeam hardening correction for X-ray computed tomography of heterogeneous natural materials  ap. 49-61.  aWe present a new method for correcting beam hardening artifacts in polychromatic X-ray CT data. On most industrial CT systems, software beam-hardening correction employs some variety of linearization, which attempts to transform the polychromatic attenuation data into its monochromatic equivalent prior to image reconstruction. However, determining optimal coefficients for the transform equation is not straightforward, especially if the material is not well known or characterized, as is the usual case when imaging geological materials. Our method uses an iterative optimization algorithm to find a generalized spline-interpolated transform that minimizes artifacts as defined by an expert user. This generality accesses a richer set of linearization functions that may better accommodate the effects of multiple materials in heterogeneous samples. When multiple materials are present in the scan field, there is no single optimal correction, and the solution can vary depending on which aspects of the beam-hardening and other image artifacts the user wants to minimize. For example, the correction can be optimized to maximize the fidelity of the object outline for solid model creation rather than simply to minimize variation of CT numbers within the material. We demonstrate our method on a range of specimens of varying difficulty and complexity, with consistently positive results.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3acomputed tomography 3acomputer software 3acomputers 3aequations 3aimage analysis 3amodels 0aComputed tomography 0aBeam hardening 0aX-ray 0aStreak artifacts1 aHanna, Romy D.0 tComputers & geosciences.g2014 June, v. 67 p.49-61dElsevier LtdwJournal:12438x0098-30047nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cageo.2014.03.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03537naa a2200637 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100006600147245013600213300001600349520163800365592002802003650002302031650002302054650002802077650001702105650001702122650001702139650001702156650001702173650001702190650001602207650001002223650002302233650001002256650001502266650001402281650001102295650001802306650002202324650001602346650001002362650000902372650001402381650002402395650000902419650002002428650002602448650001302474650001302487651001102500653001502511653002502526653002102551700002502572700003302597700002502630700002902655773011202684856008202796852000902878655001202887IND60623610020221122115450.0190401e201902  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062361002DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fct.2018.11.0462doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCarvajal-Moreno, Magda1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3542-027010aPresence of unreported carcinogens, Aflatoxins and their hydroxylated metabolites, in industrialized Oaxaca cheese from Mexico City  ap. 128-138.  aAflatoxins (AFs) are toxic secondary metabolites of the fungi Aspergillus flavus, A. parasiticus and A. nomius. The fungi produce these AFs in cereals, oilseeds and spices. AFs have damaging effects on all organisms, including humans, and their symptoms can be classified as acute (vomiting, hemorrhage and death) or chronic (immunodepression, Reye syndrome, Kwashiorkor, teratogenesis, hepatitis, cirrhosis, and various cancers). Basic AFs (AFB1, AFB2, AFG1, and AFG2) are metabolized in the liver or by microbes that produce hydroxylated metabolites (AFM1, AFM2, and AFP1) and aflatoxicol (AFL), soluble in water and easy to dispose. Thus, AFs can be excreted in fluids, such as milk. AFs are not destroyed in the process of making cheese.The purpose of this study was to identify and quantify the AFs present in 30 samples of industrialized Oaxaca-type cheese sold in Mexico City. The average concentrations of AFs detected in the 30 samples of industrialized cheese were as follows: AFB1 (0.1 μg kg−1) in 20% (6/30); a trace amount of AFB2 (0.01 < LOD) in only 3% (1/30); AFG1 (0.14 μg kg−1) in 10% (3/30); AFG2 (0.6 μg kg−1) in 30% (9/30); AFM1 (1.7 μg kg−1) in 57% (17/30); AFP1 (0.03% μg kg−1) in 3% (1/30); and AFL (13.1 μg kg−1) in 97% (29/30). AFB1 and AFL were the most abundant aflatoxins in Oaxaca-type cheese. However, eight aflatoxins were present, contributing an average of 15.7 μg kg−1 AFs distributed among the 30 samples. The risk assessment analysis showed that there was no substantial risk for cancer due to AFs in industrialized Oaxaca cheese from Mexico City.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAspergillus flavus 3aAspergillus nomius 3aAspergillus parasiticus 3aaflatoxin B1 3aaflatoxin B2 3aaflatoxin G1 3aaflatoxin G2 3aaflatoxin M1 3aaflatoxin M2 3acarcinogens 3adeath 3afood contamination 3afungi 3ahemorrhage 3ahepatitis 3ahumans 3ahydroxylation 3aindustrialization 3akwashiorkor 3aliver 3amilk 3aneoplasms 3apasta filata cheese 3arisk 3arisk assessment 3asecondary metabolites 3atoxicity 3avomiting 3aMexico 0aAflatoxins 0aCheese contamination 0aFood carcinogens1 aVargas-Ortiz, Manuel1 aHernández-Camarillo, Estela1 aRuiz-Velasco, Silvia1 aRojo-Callejas, Francisco0 tFood and chemical toxicology.g2019 Feb., v. 124 p.128-138dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl33424x0278-69157nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fct.2018.11.0463Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01716naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001500149245009800164300001800262520059000280592002800870650001100898650001600909650002200925650001400947650001100961650002600972650002200998650001101020650002901031651001801060700002201078700001601100700001801116700001801134773008601152856008301238852000901321655001201330IND60096756620221120155951.0141104e201105  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009675662DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enpol.2011.02.0252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBird, Lori10aEvaluating renewable portfolio standards and carbon cap scenarios in the U.S. electric sector  ap. 2573-2585.  aThis report examines the impact of renewable portfolio standards (RPS) and cap-and-trade policy options on the U.S. electricity sector.

As a cold-temperate species, high temperature is a critical abiotic stress factor that can affect the growth and development of this seaweed. Exploring the regulatory mechanisms of P. yezoensis resistance to high temperatures has significance in breeding high temperature-resistant strains. To investigate the potential role of microRNA (miRNA) regulation in heat stress, we constructed and sequenced four libraries (one control and three heat stressed). A total of 1213 miRNAs, corresponding to 174 miRNA families and 10 miRNAs precursors producing 14 novel mature miRNAs were identified. Among them, 98 miRNAs were differentially expressed under heat stress. The quantitative PCR of six selected miRNAs verified the deep sequencing data. This study represents the first set of heat-responsive miRNAs from P. yezoensis, and provides valuable information for understanding the miRNA-mediated heat stress responses and resistance mechanisms in P. yezoensis. The results offer a foundation for future studies on the genetic improvement of Pyropia heat stress tolerance.  aPublisher supplied data  a41176153cNational Nature Science Foundation of China  aJQ201509cScience Fund for Distinguished Young Scholars of Shandong Province 3aPyropia yezoensis 3abreeding 3agene expression regulation 3agenetic improvement 3agrowth and development 3aheat 3aheat shock response 3aheat stress 3aheat tolerance 3ahigh-throughput nucleotide sequencing 3amacroalgae 3amicroRNA 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3aresistance mechanisms 3astress tolerance 3atemperature1 aZhang, Xiaowen1 aShi, Lei1 aHao, Cuicui1 aYe, Naihao1 aLi, Fengmei0 tJournal of applied phycology.g2018 Feb., v. 30, no. 1 p.685-696dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl3870059x0921-89717nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10811-017-1260-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01792naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100001500112245009600127300001300223500001900236520077600255592002801031650001501059650001501074650001201089650002601101650001201127650002101139651001001160653001501170653001601185653002101201653002301222700001601245700001401261773014601275852000901421655001201430IND60721398320221119082105.0201224e198503  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072139832DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChalla, O.10aStudies on Humic Substances from Forest Soils of Tarai (Foot-hills) Region of Uttar Pradesh  ap. 5-10.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aHumic and fulvic acids isolated from representative soil samples of Beni and Khamia series (Aquic Hapludoll) and from Patharchatta series (Typic Hapludoll) in tarai (foot-hill) region exhibited minimum heterogeneity with respect to their elemental composition, molecular weight, functional groups and spectral properties, the former having relatively higher values than the latter.

We present a separate focus on the formation, the structure, the dynamics, and the mechanics of both permanent chemical and transient supramolecular networks. Particular emphasis is placed on features such as the formation and the effect of network inhomogeneities, the manifestation of the crosslink relaxation dynamics in the macroscopic sample behavior, and the applicability of concepts developed for classical polymer melts, solutions, and networks such as the reptation model and the principle of time–temperature superposition (263 references).  aPublisher supplied data 3achemical bonding 3acrosslinking 3amechanics 3amelting 3amodels 3apolymers1 aSprakel, Joris0 tChemical Society reviews.g2012 Jan. 4, v. 41, no. 2 p.909-930dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:20471x1460-47447nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c1cs15191f3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02800naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002000153245011300173300001400286520153200300592002801832650002001860650001801880650001101898650002201909650002601931650001501957650001001972650001401982650001101996650001602007650001602023653001502039653001902054653001702073653001202090653001302102653001102115700002202126773010102148856008702249961000902336852000902345655001202354IND60599065120221118200656.0180702e201410  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059906512DNAL7 a10.1016/j.earscirev.2013.12.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPietsch, Carlie14aThe importance of oxygen for the disparate recovery patterns of the benthic macrofauna in the Early Triassic  ap. 65-84.  aThe end-Permian mass extinction, 252millionyears ago, decimated life on Earth including the benthic marine invertebrate macrofauna. A return to pre-extinction levels of diversity and complex ecological systems took approximately 5millionyears. This review provides the most up to date synthesis of the progression of the benthic marine invertebrate macrofaunal recovery. We found the rates and patterns of the benthic recovery to vary both across the globe and between different investigators. The continuation of deleterious environmental conditions including low oxygen concentrations and high temperatures likely played a large role in the delayed recovery. Ocean basins, such as Neo-Tethys, show evidence for continued oxygenation past the extinction event which extended the lifespan and diversity of specific benthic communities. Shortly after the extinction boundary, shoreface environments with moderate wave energy were sites of water column oxygenation that supported a more rapid return to diverse and ecologically complex benthic communities. We find that the location and longevity of oxygenated environments is an overarching mechanism that partially explains varied global recovery patterns. Synergistic perturbations including an acidification event at the Permian–Triassic boundary and high temperature events contributed to lasting environmental perturbations. In an effort to standardize future results and discussion of the benthic recovery, we support the use of a modified recovery rubric proposed here.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTriassic period 3aacidification 3abasins 3abenthic organisms 3aenvironmental factors 3aextinction 3afauna 3alongevity 3aoxygen 3atemperature 3awater power 0aExtinction 0aEarly Triassic 0aPaleoecology 0aBenthic 0aRecovery 0aOxygen1 aBottjer, David J.0 tEarth-science reviews.g2014 Oct., v. 137 p.65-84dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11685x0012-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.earscirev.2013.12.0023Available from publisher's site  aUSDA  aDNAL 7aarticle02814naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094024002200131024001900153040001800172100002100190245007800211300001600289506007600305520119100381592002801572506003701600650001001637650001601647650001701663650000901680650001201689650001401701650001401715650001901729650001301748653001301761653000901774653002801783653003701811653003801848700002001886700002001906700001701926700002101943700002301964700002001987700002202007700001602029700002102045773011302066856008402179852000902263655001202272IND60584684620221207122701.0181002e20171115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058468462DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ydbio.2017.09.0242doi7 aPMC56582452pmcid7 a289471782pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTalebian, Asghar10aAutonomous and non-autonomous roles for ephrin-B in interneuron migration  ap. 179-193.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aWhile several studies indicate the importance of ephrin-B/EphB bidirectional signaling in excitatory neurons, potential roles for these molecules in inhibitory neurons are largely unknown. We identify here an autonomous receptor-like role for ephrin-B reverse signaling in the tangential migration of interneurons into the neocortex using ephrin-B (EfnB1/B2/B3) conditional triple mutant (TMˡᶻ) mice and a forebrain inhibitory neuron specific Cre driver. Inhibitory neuron deletion of the three EfnB genes leads to reduced interneuron migration, abnormal cortical excitability, and lethal audiogenic seizures. Truncated and intracellular point mutations confirm the importance of ephrin-B reverse signaling in interneuron migration and cortical excitability. A non-autonomous ligand-like role was also identified for ephrin-B2 that is expressed in neocortical radial glial cells and required for proper tangential migration of GAD65-positive interneurons. Our studies thus define both receptor-like and ligand-like roles for the ephrin-B molecules in controlling the migration of interneurons as they populate the neocortex and help establish excitatory/inhibitory (E/I) homeostasis.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3agenes 3ahomeostasis 3ainterneurons 3amice 3amutants 3aneocortex 3aneuroglia 3apoint mutation 3aseizures 0aEphrin-B 0aEphB 0aBidirectional signaling 0aInhibitory interneuron migration 0aExcitatory/inhibitory homeostasis1 aBritton, Rachel1 aAmmanuel, Simon1 aBepari, Asim1 aSprouse, Francis1 aBirnbaum, Shari G.1 aSzabó, Gábor,1 aTamamaki, Nobuaki1 aGibson, Jay1 aHenkemeyer, Mark0 tDevelopmental biology.g2017 Nov. 15, v. 431, no. 2 p.179-193dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12382x0012-16067nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ydbio.2017.09.0243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02827naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245015700169300001600326520148800342592002801830650002001858650001101878650001201889650001901901650001201920650001401932650001101946650001001957650001501967650001101982650001501993651001802008651001802026653003402044653003302078653002402111653003402135653002202169773010802191856008502299852000902384655001202393IND60559892220221122130214.0180904e20161115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055989222DNAL7 a10.1016/j.quaint.2015.12.0812doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMarsh, Erik J.14aThe disappearing desert and the emergence of agropastoralism: An adaptive cycle of rapid change in the mid-Holocene Lake Titicaca Basin (Peru–Bolivia)  ap. 123-134.  aThe mid-Holocene was an extremely dry period in the Lake Titicaca Basin of South America, when lake levels were at their lowest point in the Holocene. South of the lake, a lack of outflow and very low and irregular precipitation would have created desert-like conditions. This area's ‘archaeological silence’ seems to reflect an effective lack of population. This situation changed drastically as lake levels rose suddenly in the centuries following 3540 cal BP. As the desert disappeared, a flux of migrants filled the landscape, probably from the population concentration in the basin's western highlands. They imported and developed new technologies and economic practices and reorganized them into an agropastoral lifeway. The emergence of agropastoralism was both rapid and widespread, as people throughout the Lake Titicaca Basin adopted this practice. This major, regional shift can be productively framed as an adaptive cycle or Holling loop. This approach builds on the robust foundation of complexity theory, emphasizes the integrated nature of humans and their environment in a single system, highlights how systems fluctuate between slow and accelerated change, and is useful for developing hypotheses. Cascading feedback loops in climate, ecology, and cultural practices generated the emergence of agropastoralism. This resilient system is still in use today and is currently facing major climate changes, which makes understanding its origins especially relevant.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagropastoralism 3abasins 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3aecology 3ahighlands 3ahumans 3alakes 3alandscapes 3apeople 3atechnology 3aLake Titicaca 3aSouth America 0aAdaptive cycle (Holling loop) 0aEmergence of agropastoralism 0aLake Titicaca Basin 0aBayesian chronological models 0aArid mid-Holocene0 tQuaternary international.g2016 Nov. 15, v. 422 p.123-134dElsevier LtdwJournal:12411x1040-61827nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.quaint.2015.12.0813Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01910naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001500149245008800164300001800252500001900270520081600289592002801105650001101133650001401144650001301158650001101171700001601182700001701198700001301215700001601228700005201244700005101296773012101347856008301468852000901551655001201560IND60708025920221118125503.0200821e20200811xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070802592DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.orglett.0c023202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Peng10aCu-Catalyzed Direct Amination of Cyclic Amides via C–OH Bond Activation Using DMF  ap. 6547-6551.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aHerein, we describe a Cu-catalyzed approach to directly accessing aromatic heterocyclic amines from cyclic amides. The most-reported methods for cyclic amide conversions to aromatic heterocyclic amines use an activating group, such as a halogen atom or a trifluoromethane sulfonyl group. However, subsequent elimination of activating groups during the amination process results in significant waste. This copper-catalyzed direct amination of cyclic amides in DMF forms aromatic heterocyclic amines with environmental friendliness and readily available reagents. A plausible radical mechanism has been proposed for the reaction. Meanwhile, the coordinating effect of the N1 atom is key to the success of this reaction, which provides assistance to the copper ions for the activation and amination of C–O bonds.  aPublisher supplied data 3aamides 3aamination 3ahalogens 3awastes1 aLuo, Kaixiu1 aYu, Xianglin1 aYuan, Xu1 aLiu, Xiaoyu1 aLin, Jun1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2087-60131 aJin, Yi1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1348-24860 tOrganic letters.g2020 Aug. 11, v. 22, no. 16 p.6547-6551dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19216x1523-70527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.orglett.0c023203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03370naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001800153245012300171300001400294520200000308592002802308650001902336650002002355650001102375650001702386650001502403650001502418650001002433650001702443650001902460650001202479650001302491650001102504650001202515650001602527653003202543653001402575653001102589653001202600653001602612653001602628653001102644700002102655773011602676856008702792852000902879655001202888IND60599065220221118200633.0180702e201410  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059906522DNAL7 a10.1016/j.earscirev.2013.12.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFeng, Qinglai10aEvolution of oceanic redox conditions during the Permo-Triassic transition: Evidence from deepwater radiolarian facies  ap. 34-51.  aThe ~90% biodiversity loss among marine invertebrate species during the end-Permian mass extinction, the most severe Phanerozoic biocrisis, has been attributed to widespread oceanic anoxia (“superanoxia”). Recent studies of the lithofacies, inorganic geochemistry, and biomarkers of Permian–Triassic boundary (PTB) sections have yielded an inferred pattern of oceanic redox changes that is complex and sometimes inconsistent. In this contribution, we review the ecology of radiolarians, an important microzooplankton group during the Permo–Triassic transition, and consider its implications for contemporaneous changes in paleoceanographic conditions. Our analysis shows that (1) Late Permian radiolarian faunas were cosmopolitan with different orders having specific depth preferences, i.e., albaillellarians favoring deeper waters and spherical forms (entactinarians and spumellarians) shallower waters; (2) deep-water taxa declined earlier than shallow-water taxa; (3) many Paleozoic-type taxa survived into the Early Triassic but went extinct during a second crisis in the Dienerian (“dead clade walking”), followed by the appearance or expansion of Mesozoic-type taxa during the Olenekian; and (4) the survival of Paleozoic-type taxa during the Early Triassic was greater at higher paleolatitudes than in the tropics. These observations are consistent with a first-order redox control on radiolarian faunal distributions, specifically a shallowing and poleward expansion of the oceanic oxygen-minimum zone during the PTB crisis. The consequent adaptation of some deepwater taxa to shallower environments resulted in Early Triassic radiolarian faunas in continental basins becoming more similar to those in pelagic settings. Enhanced survival of Paleozoic-type taxa in high-latitude regions indicates that the main stressor on Permo-Triassic radiolarian communities was reduced oceanic oxygen levels (stronger in the tropics) rather than climatic warming (stronger at the poles).  aPublisher supplied data 3aPermian period 3aTriassic period 3abasins 3abiodiversity 3abiomarkers 3aextinction 3afauna 3ageochemistry 3aglobal warming 3ahypoxia 3alatitude 3aoxygen 3atropics 3azooplankton 0aEnd-Permian mass extinction 0aBiocrisis 0aAnoxia 0aSuboxic 0aZooplankton 0aPanthalassa 0aTethys1 aAlgeo, Thomas J.0 tEarth-science reviews.g2014 Oct., v. 137 p.34-51dElsevier B.V.aElsevier B.V.wJournal:11685x0012-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.earscirev.2013.12.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03036naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100005100155245013000206520152700336592002801863650001101891650001201902650001101914650002101925650003401946650002701980650002102007650001202028650001302040650002502053650001402078650001002092650001602102650001902118650001702137650002202154653001002176653002302186653000902209653002802218653000802246700001502254700001602269700001702285700001202302700001402314773009102328856009002419852000902509655001202518IND60767763920221119082614.0220906e202206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076776392DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2022.1339942doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMa, Hua1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1855-548812aA light-enhanced α-FeOOH nanowires/polyaniline anode for improved electricity generation performance in microbial fuel cells  aLow power density and poor anode performance seriously limit the potential of practical application of microbial fuel cell (MFC). Utilizing solar energy by developing photoanode is one of the effective pathways to improve the performance of MFC. Here solar energy harvesting was integrated into MFC to achieved the comprehensive utilization of multiple energy sources. A hybrid MFC photoanode (α-FeOOH-NWs/PANI anode) was constructed by loading polyaniline (PANI) and α-FeOOH nanowires (α-FeOOH-NWs) on carbon paper through electro-polymerization synthesis method. Compared with clean carbon paper, nanowires and PANI increased the surface roughness of the electrode, which facilitated the biofilm formation. The electrochemical and photoelectric analysis demonstrated that PANI introduced new electroactive groups and reduced the charge transfer resistance, exhibiting excellent electrochemical and photoelectric activites. The MFC with the α-FeOOH-NWs/PANI photoanode had higher voltage output and power density under light illumination, with the power density of 1.95 W/m² under light, which was 1.4 times higher than that without light. The hybrid α-FeOOH-NWs/PANI photoanode enhanced the separation efficiency of photogenerated electron-hole pairs, thereby improving the photoelectric response capability and generating a high photocurrent. Our research provided a new concept for the combination of solar energy harvesting and MFCs, yielding an overall enhancement of electricity eneration performance in MFC.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanodes 3abiofilm 3acarbon 3aelectric current 3aelectric potential difference 3aelectricity generation 3aelectrochemistry 3ahybrids 3alighting 3amicrobial fuel cells 3ananowires 3apaper 3apolyaniline 3apolymerization 3asolar energy 3asurface roughness 0aLight 0aα-FeOOH nanowires 0aPANI 0aPhotogenerated electron 0aMFC1 aZheng, Yun1 aXian, Jiali1 aFeng, Zijuan1 aLi, Zhe1 aCui, Fuyi0 tChemosphere.g2022 June, v. 296 p.133994-dElsevier LtdwJournal:1969x0045-65357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2022.1339943Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03577naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002500153245010600178300001800284520193400302592002802236650001202264650001102276650002502287650001502312650001802327650002202345650002202367650001802389650002402407650002302431650002102454650002102475650001502496650002302511650001102534650001702545650001402562651001002576653003202586653001302618653002002631653000802651700001402659700001302673700001302686700002502699700002502724700001802749700002602767773012102793856008802914852000903002655001203011IND60563776320221119205845.0201125e20161215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056377632DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2016.03.2422doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLópez-Serrano, F.R.10aInfluences of recovery from wildfire and thinning on soil respiration of a Mediterranean mixed forest  ap. 1217-1231.  aThe ecosystem recovery after wildfire and thinning practices are both key processes that have great potential to influence fluxes and storage of carbon within Mediterranean semiarid ecosystems. In this study, started 7years after a wildfire, soil respiration (SR) patterns measured from 2008 to 2010 were compared between an unmanaged-undisturbed mature forest stand (UB site) and a naturally regenerated post-wildfire stand (B site) in a Mediterranean mixed forest in Spain. The disturbed stand included a control zone (unthinned forest, BUT site) and a thinned zone (BT site).Our results indicated that SR was lower at naturally regenerated after fire sites (BUT and BT) than at unburnt one. Soil under the canopy layer of pine and oak trees exhibited higher SR rates than bare or herbaceous layer soils, regardless of the site. The effect of thinning was only manifest, with a significant increase of SR, during the 1st year after thinning practices. SR showed a clear soil temperature-dependent seasonal pattern, which was strongly modulated by soil water content (SWC), especially in summer. Site-specific polynomial regression models were defined to describe SR responses, being mainly controlled by both soil temperature (Ts) and SWC at UB site, or Ts at burnt sites. The sensitivity of SR rate to Ts variations (Q₁₀) ranged between 0.20 and 6.89, with mean annual values varying between 0.92 and 1.35. Q₁₀ values were higher at BT than at UB-BUT sites. The results revealed a significant, non-linear dependence, of Q₁₀ on both Ts and SWC at UB site, and on Ts at both burnt sites. This study contributes to (i) improve the understanding of how natural recovery and management practices affect soil respiration in a Mediterranean forest during their early stages after fire disturbance and (ii) highlight the importance of Q₁₀ values <1 which emphasizes drought stress effect on SR temperature sensitivity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aQuercus 3acanopy 3acarbon sequestration 3aecosystems 3aforest stands 3aground vegetation 3aherbaceous plants 3amixed forests 3aregression analysis 3aseasonal variation 3asoil respiration 3asoil temperature 3asoil water 3asoil water content 3asummer 3awater stress 3awildfires 3aSpain 0aMediterranean maritime pine 0aHolm oak 0aSoil CO2 efflux 0aQ101 aRubio, E.1 aDadi, T.1 aMoya, D.1 aAndrés-Abellán, M.1 aGarcía-Morote, F.A.1 aMiettinen, H.1 aMartínez-García, E.0 tScience of the total environment.g2016 Dec. 15, v. 573 p.1217-1231dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2016.03.2423Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03543naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002400144245014600168300002000314520155000334592002801884650002301912650002101935650001301956650001901969650002201988650002302010650001302033650001902046650001302065650001102078650002402089650002102113653001502134653002202149653001502171653002102186653001202207653003602219700005902255700002302314700001802337700002002355700005702375700003002432700002102462700002502483700002202508700001902530700006002549700002202609700001902631700006202650773014202712856007802854852000902932655001202941IND60686774220221116235124.0200318e20200221xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068677422DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.9b221442doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLegge, Elizabeth J.10aDetermining the Level and Location of Functional Groups on Few-Layer Graphene and Their Effect on the Mechanical Properties of Nanocomposites  ap. 13481-13493.  aGraphene is a highly desirable material for a variety of applications; in the case of nanocomposites, it can be functionalized and added as a nanofiller to alter the ultimate product properties, such as tensile strength. However, often the material properties of the functionalized graphene and the location of any chemical species, attached via different functionalization processes, are not known. Thus, it is not necessarily understood why improvements in product performance are achieved, which hinders the rate of product development. Here, a commercially available powder containing few-layer graphene (FLG) flakes is characterized before and after plasma or chemical functionalization with either nitrogen or oxygen species. A range of measurement techniques, including tip-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (TERS), time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (ToF-SIMS), and NanoSIMS, were used to examine the physical and chemical changes in the FLG material at both the micro- and nanoscale. This is the first reported TERS imaging of commercially available FLG flakes of submicron lateral size, revealing the location of the defects (edge versus basal plane) and variations in the level of functionalization. Graphene–polymer composites were then produced, and the dispersion of the graphitic material in the matrix was visualized using ToF-SIMS. Finally, mechanical testing of the composites demonstrated that the final product performance could be enhanced but differed depending on the properties of the original graphitic material.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRaman spectroscopy 3achemical species 3agraphene 3aimage analysis 3amass spectrometry 3amechanical testing 3amoieties 3ananocomposites 3anitrogen 3aoxygen 3aproduct development 3atensile strength 0acommercial 0afunctionalization 0acomposites 0acharacterization 0adefects 0atip-enhanced Raman spectroscopy1 aPaton, Keith R.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0300-86761 aWywijas, Magdalena1 aMcMahon, Greg1 aPemberton, Rory1 aKumar, Naresh1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8953-54201 aAranga Raju, Arun Prakash1 aDawson, Craig P.1 aStrudwick, Andrew J.1 aBradley, James W.1 aStolojan, Vlad1 aSilva, S.

Short‐term anoxic events are thought to release sorbed P and enhance its acquisition by soil microbes. However, the actual effects of anoxic conditions on microbial P acquisition in humid tropical forest soils are surprisingly poorly studied. We used laboratory incubations of bulk soils, NanoSIMS analysis of single microbial cells, and landscape‐scale measurements in the Luquillo Experimental Forest (LEF), Puerto Rico to test the hypothesis that anoxic conditions increase microbial P acquisition in humid tropical forests. In laboratory and field experiments, we found that microbial P uptake generally decreased under anoxic conditions, leading to high microbial carbon (C) to P ratios in anoxic soils. The decreased P acquisition under anoxic conditions was correlated with lower microbial C use efficiency (CUE), an index of microbial energy transfer in ecosystems. Phosphorus amendments to anoxic soils led to increased microbial P uptake and higher CUE suggesting that microbes were less able to access and utilize P under natural low redox conditions. Under oxic conditions, microbial C:P ratios and CUE did not respond to changes in substrate stoichiometry. These results challenge the existing paradigm by showing that anoxic conditions can decrease microbial P uptake and ultimately constrain microbial CUE. Our findings indicate that soil redox conditions tightly couple soil P and C cycles and advance our understanding of controls on P cycling in humid tropical forest ecosystems.  aPublisher supplied data  cNSFdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100000001  cUSDAdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100000199  cUSDOEdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100000015  cUS‐Israeli Bi National Agricultural Research and Development Postdoctoral Fellowship  aTES‐DE‐FOA‐0000749cDepartment of Energy  aDEB‐1457805cNational Science Foundation  aSCW1478cOBER Genomic Sciences Early Career Research Program Award  aEAR‐1331841cLuquillo CZO  aDEB‐0620910cLTER  aCA‐B‐ECO‐7673‐MScUSDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture, McIntire Stennis Project0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aenergy transfer 3amicrobial carbon 3aphosphorus 3asorption 3astoichiometry 3atropical forests 3aPuerto Rico1 aLin, Yang1 aWeber, Peter K.1 aPett‐Ridge, Jennifer1 aSilver, Whendee L.0 tEcology.g2020 Feb., v. 101, no. 2 p.e02928-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl46164x0012-96587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ecy.29283Available from publisher's site  aVersion of Record  aDNAL 7aarticle02117naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002200149245013300171300001800304500001900322520058400341592002800925650001400953650003000967650000900997650002701006650004401033650001601077700002001093700005601113700005901169700001301228700005801241700001601299700002301315700002201338700006101360700006101421773012101482856008301603852000901686655001201695IND60708026220221121054749.0200821e20200810xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070802622DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.orglett.0c023452doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLux, Michaelyn C.10aSynthesis of Bridged Bicyclic Amines by Intramolecular Amination of Remote C–H Bonds: Synergistic Activation by Light and Heat  ap. 6578-6583.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe construction of complex aza-cycles is of interest to drug discovery due to the prevalence of nitrogen-containing heterocycles in pharmaceutical agents.

High-throughput technologies, both bulk and single cell, now allow for investigation of the properties and quantities of these interactors. Computational algorithms and machine learning methods then provide the tools to derive meaningful insights from the resulting data sets. One such approach is graphical network modeling, which provides a computational framework to explicitly model the molecular interactions within and between the cells comprising biological systems. These graphical networks aim to describe a putative chain of cause and effect between interacting molecules. This feature allows for determination of key molecules in a biological process, accelerated generation of mechanistic hypotheses, and simulation of experimental outcomes. We review the computational concepts and applications of graphical network models across molecular scales for both intracellular and intercellular regulatory biology, examples of successful applications, and the future directions needed to overcome current limitations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3aartificial intelligence 3abiological control 3acells 3adata collection 3amolecular models 3awebs 0amultiomics 0agenomics 0amachine learning 0anetworks 0acomputational biology1 aGore, Jessica1 aGemmill, Kelly1 aGaykalova, Daria A.1 aFertig, Elana J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3204-342X0 tMolecular cell.g2022 Jan. 20, v. 82, no. 2 p.260-273dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12017x1097-27657nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.molcel.2021.12.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03103naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094024002200127024001900149040001800168100001800186245012800204300002000332506007600352520159400428592002802022506003702050650001802087650001802105650002902123650001102152650000902163650001202172650002102184650001302205650001402218650001902232650001402251650001302265700001102278700002102289700001802310700001902328700002202347773017602369856007902545852000902624655001202633IND60178490920221207125546.0150604e20131224xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6017849092DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.13105591102doi7 aPMC38762672pmcid7 a242551082pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBailey, Emily10aFLT3/D835Y mutation knock-in mice display less aggressive disease compared with FLT3/internal tandem duplication (ITD) mice  ap. 21113-21118.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aFMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) is mutated in approximately one third of acute myeloid leukemia cases. The most common FLT3 mutations in acute myeloid leukemia are internal tandem duplication (ITD) mutations in the juxtamembrane domain (23%) and point mutations in the tyrosine kinase domain (10%). The mutation substituting the aspartic acid at position 838 (equivalent to the human aspartic acid residue at position 835) with a tyrosine (referred to as FLT3/D835Y hereafter) is the most frequent kinase domain mutation, converting aspartic acid to tyrosine. Although both of these mutations constitutively activate FLT3, patients with an ITD mutation have a significantly poorer prognosis. To elucidate the mechanisms behind this prognostic difference, we have generated a knock-in mouse model with a D838Y point mutation in FLT3 that corresponds to the FLT3/D835Y mutation described in humans. Compared with FLT3/ITD knock-in mice, the FLT3/D835Y knock-in mice survive significantly longer. The majority of these mice develop myeloproliferative neoplasms with a less-aggressive phenotype. In addition, FLT3/D835Y mice have distinct hematopoietic development patterns. Unlike the tremendous depletion of the hematopoietic stem cell compartment we have observed in FLT3/ITD mice, FLT3/D835Y mutant mice are not depleted in hematopoietic stem cells. Further comparisons of these FLT3/D835Y knock-in mice with FLT3/ITD mice should provide an ideal platform for dissecting the molecular mechanisms that underlie the prognostic differences between the two different types of FLT3 mutations.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aanimal models 3aaspartic acid 3ahematopoietic stem cells 3ahumans 3amice 3amutants 3amyeloid leukemia 3apatients 3aphenotype 3apoint mutation 3aprognosis 3atyrosine1 aLi, Li1 aDuffield, Amy S.1 aMa, Hayley S.1 aHuso, David L.1 aSmall, Donald B.,0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2013 Dec. 24, v. 110, no. 52 p.21113-21118dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.13105591103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03501naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001600155245016300171520191400334592002802248650001802276650002602294650002202320650003902342650002302381650001002404650001702414650001502431650001102446650001902457650001302476650002602489650003702515650002502552653002302577653003102600653002302631653002302654653002502677700001202702700001302714700001602727700005602743700001802799773009102817856009002908852000902998655001203007IND60767764120221119082615.0220906e202206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076776412DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2022.1339962doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXu, Ronghua10aComparing biotransformation of extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) under aerobic and anoxic conditions: Reactivities, components, and bacterial responses  aThis study aimed to better understand the transformation behaviors of extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) and their roles in regulating bacterial community in biological wastewater treatment processes. Herein, well-controlled bioassays under aerobic and anoxic conditions were performed to investigate degradation dynamics, composition variations, and bacterial response during EPS transformation. Reactivity continuum modeling showed that organic pools of EPS had continuous reactivity distributions, and most labile organic fraction with a degrading rate >0.1 h⁻¹ was substantially higher under aerobic (20.47%) than anoxic (2.02%) condition. Rapid degradation of protein-like substances in the initial degradation stage was accompanied by the humification process, as revealed by UV absorption spectroscopy, fluorescence spectroscopy, and size exclusion chromatography with continuous organic carbon detection analysis. The 16S rRNA gene sequencing results showed that the selection effect of EPS in controlling abundant populations during their transformation, e.g., Acinetobacter was enriched, and Candidatus Competibacter was washed out relative to the source community. Furthermore, taxonomic normalized stochasticity ratio-based null model and bacterial ecological network analysis indicated higher relative importance of deterministic process in shaping the EPS-degrading communities under aerobic than anoxic condition, likely explaining the faster EPS biotransformation under aerobic condition. Intriguingly, the keystone populations driving EPS metabolism showed the environmental filtering characteristics (e.g., capable of degrading refractory and aromatic compounds or adapting to harsh environments) and cooperative interactions with the co-occurring species under both conditions. This work is expected to reveal the fates and roles of EPS in wastewater treatment plants extensively.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAcinetobacter 3abacterial communities 3abiotransformation 3afluorescence emission spectroscopy 3agel chromatography 3agenes 3ahumification 3ametabolism 3amodels 3aorganic carbon 3apolymers 3atrophic relationships 3aultraviolet-visible spectroscopy 3awastewater treatment 0aEPS transformation 0aReactivity continuum model 0aBacterial assembly 0aEcological network 0aWastewater treatment1 aFu, Yue1 aXu, Yubo1 aZheng, Xing1 aHuang, Yu-Xi1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8688-65911 aMeng, Fangang0 tChemosphere.g2022 June, v. 296 p.133996-dElsevier LtdwJournal:1969x0045-65357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2022.1339963Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03080naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100005900152245011700211300001600328520120500344592002801549650004401577650002201621650001501643650001501658650002201673650001201695650002401707650001101731650001501742650003701757650000901794650001101803650001101814650001601825650000701841650001501848650003301863650002101896650001601917650003701933651001201970653002301982653006302005653002502068653003302093653002002126700002002146700002302166700006002189700002202249773013502271856008702406852000902493655001202502IND60605275720221121213614.0201202e20181015xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060527572DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2018.06.0952doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHokkanen, Sanna1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2588-596310aRemoval of Cd2+, Ni2+ and PO43− from aqueous solution by hydroxyapatite-bentonite clay-nanocellulose composite  ap. 903-912.  aA novel hydroxyapatite-bentonite clay-nanocellulose (CHA-BENT-NCC) composite material was successfully prepared as adsorbent for the removal of Ni²⁺, Cd²⁺ and PO₄³⁻ from aqueous solutions. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), energy dispersive analysis of X-rays (EDAX), X-ray diffraction analysis (XRD) and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) were used for characterization of the adsorbent. The effect of pH, contact time, temperature, and initial adsorbate concentration were studied for optimization purpose. The adsorption behavior of the investigated ions were well described by the Freundlich adsorption model, and the maximum adsorption capacity for Ni²⁺, Cd²⁺ and PO₄³⁻ was estimated to be 29.46 mmol/g, 10.34 mmol/g and 4.90 mmol/g, respectively. Desorption efficiency was achieved by treatment with 0.01 M HNO₃ for metals and 0.10 M NaOH for PO₄³⁻. Five adsorption–desorption cycles were performed without significant decrease in adsorption capacities. The CHA-BENT-NCC material proved to be a very effective adsorption material for the treatment of mining water also from a copper mine in Finland.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aX-ray diffraction 3aadsorbents 3aadsorption 3aaqueous solutions 3acadmium 3acomposite materials 3acopper 3adesorption 3aenergy-dispersive X-ray analysis 3aions 3amodels 3anickel 3anitric acid 3apH 3aphosphates 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asodium hydroxide 3atemperature 3atransmission electron microscopy 3aFinland 0aComposite material 0aHydroxyapatite-bentonite clay-nanocellulose (CHA-BENT-NCC) 0aAdsorption isotherms 0aMetals and phosphate removal 0aWater treatment1 aBhatnagar, Amit1 aSrivastava, Varsha1 aSuorsa, Valtteri1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1544-52831 aSillanpää, Mika0 tInternational journal of biological macromolecules.g2018 Oct. 15, v. 118 p.903-912dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12340x0141-81307nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2018.06.0953Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02296naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002400146245010800170300001800278520132300296592002801619650001301647650002201660650001101682650003401693650002001727650000901747700002501756773012201781856008201903852000901985655001201994IND60579985020221118010025.0170907e20170907xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057998502DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcb.7b044732doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJethva, Prashant
N.10aModulation of the Extent of Cooperative Structural Change During Protein Folding by Chemical Denaturant  ap. 8263-8275.  aProtein folding and unfolding reactions invariably appear to be highly cooperative reactions, but the structural and sequence determinants of cooperativity are poorly understood. Importantly, it is not known whether cooperative structural change occurs throughout the protein, or whether some parts change cooperatively and other parts change noncooperatively. In the current study, hydrogen exchange mass spectrometry has been used to show that the mechanism of unfolding of the PI3K SH3 domain is similar in the absence and presence of 5 M urea. The data are well described by a four state N ↔ IN ↔ I₂ ↔ U model, in which structural changes occur noncooperatively during the N ↔ IN and IN ↔ I₂ transitions, and occur cooperatively during the I₂ ↔ U transition. The nSrc-loop and RT-loop, as well as β strands 4 and 5 undergo noncooperative unfolding, while β strands 1, 2, and 3 unfold cooperatively in the absence of urea. However, in the presence of 5 M urea, the unfolding of β strand 4 switches to become cooperative, leading to an increase in the extent of cooperative structural change. The current study highlights the relationship between protein stability and cooperativity, by showing how the extent of cooperativity can be varied, using chemical denaturant to alter protein stability.  aPublisher supplied data 3ahydrogen 3amass spectrometry 3amodels 3aphosphatidylinositol 3-kinase 3aprotein folding 3aurea1 aUdgaonkar, Jayant B.0 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2017 Sept. 07, v. 121, no. 35 p.8263-8275dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-52077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.jpcb.7b044733Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02973naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001600148245006100164300001800225520140000243592002801643650001601671650001901687650001801706650001201724650000901736650001201745650001001757650001201767650003001779650000901809650001301818650001301831650002201844650002001866650005201886650002201938650001201960650003301972653001902005653001602024653000802040653000902048653001202057653000902069700001802078700001702096700001902113700001502132700001302147700002102160773012302181856008202304852000902386655001202395IND60533044220221121104229.0160728e20140808xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053304422DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbrc.2014.07.0642doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYan, Jingli10aArabidopsis CIPK14 positively regulates glucose response  ap. 1679-1683.  aCalcium is a ubiquitous intracellular secondary messenger in plants. Calcineurin B-like proteins (CBLs), which contain four Ca2+-binding EF hand motifs, are Ca2+ sensors and regulate a group of Ser/Thr protein kinases called CBL-interacting protein kinases (CIPKs). Although the CBL–CIPK network has been demonstrated to play crucial roles in plant development and responses to various environmental stresses in Arabidopsis, little is known about their function in glucose signaling.In the present study, we identified CIPK14 gene from Arabidopsis that play a role in glucose signaling. The subcellular localization of CIPK14 was determined using green fluorescence protein (GFP) as the reporter. Furthermore, the expression levels of CIPK14 in response to salt, drought, cold, heat, ABA, methyl viologen (MV) and glucose treatments were examined by quantitative RT-PCR and it was found to respond to multiple stimuli, suggesting that CIPK14 may be a point of convergence for several different signaling pathways. Moreover, knock-out mutation of CIPK14 rendered it more sensitive to glucose treatment. Yeast two-hybrid assay demonstrated that CIPK14 interacted with three CBLs and also with two key kinases, sucrose non-fermenting 1-related kinase (SnRK) 1.1 and SnRK1.2 implicated in glucose signaling. This is the first report to demonstrate that CIPK also plays a role in glucose signaling.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArabidopsis 3aEF hand motifs 3aabscisic acid 3acalcium 3acold 3adrought 3agenes 3aglucose 3agreen fluorescent protein 3aheat 3amutation 3aparaquat 3aplant development 3aprotein kinases 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3asecond messengers 3asucrose 3atwo hybrid system techniques 0aAbiotic stress 0aArabidopsis 0aCBL 0aCIPK 0aGlucose 0aSnRK1 aNiu, Fangfang1 aLiu, Wu-Zhen1 aZhang, Hanfeng1 aWang, Boya1 aYang, Bo1 aJiang, Yuan-Qing0 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2014 Aug. 08, v. 450 p.1679-1683dElsevier Inc.x0006-291X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2014.07.0643Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03073naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004300111040001800154100001600172245013400188300001600322520126300338592002801601650002101629650001501650650002001665650001701685650003701702650001201739650002001751650003001771650002701801650001601828650001601844650001201860650003901872650003901911650001801950650004301968650002402011650003802035650007102073650001202144650005402156700002002210700002202230700002002252700002302272700001902295700002402314773008302338856008902421852000902510655001202519IND4466563320141110000000.0141110e201207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446656332DNAL7 a225466312pmid7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2012.03.0802doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJakob, Lena10aPAH-sequestration capacity of granular and powder activated carbon amendments in soil, and their effects on earthworms and plants  ap. 699-705.  aA field lysimeter study was carried out to investigate whether the amendment of 2% powder and granular activated carbon (PAC and GAC) to a soil with moderate PAH contamination had an impact on the PAH bioaccumulation of earthworms and plants, since AC is known to be a strong sorbent for organic pollutants. Furthermore, secondary effects of AC on plants and earthworms were studied through growth and nutrient uptake, and survival and weight gain. Additionally, the effect of AC amendments on soil characteristics like pH, water holding capacity, and the water retention curve of the soil were investigated. Results show that the amendment of 2% PAC had a negative effect on plant growth while the GAC increased the growth rate of plants. PAC was toxic to earthworms, demonstrated by a significant weight loss, while the results for GAC were less clear due to ambiguous results of a field and a parallel laboratory study. Both kinds of AC significantly reduced biota to soil accumulation factors (BSAFs) of PAHs in earthworms and plants. The GAC reduced the BSAFs of earthworms by an average of 47±44% and the PAC amendment reduced them by 72±19%. For the investigated plants the BSAFs were reduced by 46±36% and 53±22% by the GAC and PAC, respectively.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactivated carbon 3aearthworms 3anutrient uptake 3aplant growth 3apolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons 3apowders 3asoil amendments 3asoil water characteristic 3awater holding capacity 3aweight gain 3aweight loss 2aAnimals 2aBiological Transportxdrug effects 2aCharcoalxchemistryxpharmacology. 2aEcotoxicology 2aOligochaetaxdrug effectsxmetabolism. 2aPhysical Phenomena. 2aPlantsxdrug effectsxmetabolism. 2aPolycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbonsxchemistryxmetabolismxtoxicity. 2aPowders 2aSoil Pollutantsxchemistryxmetabolismxtoxicity.1 aHartnik, Thomas1 aHenriksen, Thomas1 aElmquist, Marie1 aBrändli, Rahel C.1 aHale, Sarah E.1 aCornelissen, Gerard0 tChemosphere.g2012 July, v. 88, no. 6 p.699-705dElsevier Ltdx0045-65357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2012.03.0803Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02576naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100006100152245008200213300001600295520104900311592002801360650002701388650001401415650002501429650001201454650001701466650002101483650000901504650001901513650001101532650002601543650002001569650002701589650001601616650002201632653001301654653001601667653001801683653001901701653001501720653002001735653002001755700001801775700002501793700005601818773010001874856008701974852000902061655001202070IND60613426920221119141902.0190402e20190215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061342692DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2018.08.1382doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKeshavarz, Behnam1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5121-695010aMatrix effect on food allergen detection – A case study of fish parvalbumin  ap. 526-534.  aTwo fish parvalbumin models were established to study relationships among matrix effect, extractability, and thermostability during in vitro immunodetection using two parvalbumin-specific monoclonal antibodies (3E1 and PARV19). Our results illustrated that matrix-induced thermal instability of parvalbumin was due mainly to physical (hydrophobic effect) and chemical (thiol-disulfide interchange) interactions. The addition of sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS, surfactant), β-mercaptoethanol (reducing agent) or ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA, metal chelator) during sample preparation could not only increase the extractability of parvalbumin but also enhanced its immunodetection. Our findings demonstrated excess EDTA completely chelated Ca2+ in parvalbumin and rendered it undetectable using PARV19 (a Ca2+-dependent antibody). Overall, our resulted showed that matrix effect on in vitro analyte quantification cannot be underestimated. Any false negative or positive results could lead to severe or life-threatening allergic reactions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEDTA (chelating agent) 3aallergens 3abeta-mercaptoethanol 3acalcium 3acase studies 3achelating agents 3afish 3ahydrophobicity 3amodels 3amonoclonal antibodies 3areducing agents 3asodium dodecyl sulfate 3asurfactants 3athermal stability 0aAllergen 0aParvalbumin 0aMatrix effect 0aExtractability 0aSolubility 0aThermostability 0aImmunodetection1 aJiang, Xingyi1 aHsieh, Yun-Hwa Peggy1 aRao, Qinchun1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6853-53810 tFood chemistry.g2019 Feb. 15, v. 274 p.526-534dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl8139x0308-81467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2018.08.1383Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02051naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002500144245005500169300001600224520085900240592002801099650001701127650001001144650001201154650001201166650001101178650001501189650001301204650001601217650001001233651001201243651001901255653002701274653002001301653001501321653001201336653001401348653001101362653002001373653001301393773011101406856007901517852000901596655001201605IND60593503720221121184637.0180619e20171201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059350372DNAL7 a10.1515/acpa-2017-00102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDoweld, Alexander B.10aNew names of Typha of Northern Eurasia (Typhaceae)  ap. 233-236.  aThe nomenclature of some fossil and extant homonyms of Typha (Typhaceae) is resolved.

Here we showed that Ser33/Ser37/Thr41 of β-catenin fragments encompassing the armadillo repeats 1–5 (β-catenin1–781, β-catenin1–682, and β-catenin1–422) are phosphorylated by PKCα whereas β-catenin1–138 lacking these repeats is not phosphorylated. Binding-site analysis revealed that PKCα directly interacts with β-catenin through the sites on the armadillo repeats 1–5. In addition, axin fragments (365–500), which interacts with β-catenin through armadillo repeats 3–5, disrupted PKCα/β-catenin association and inhibited β-catenin phosphorylation by PKCα. In HEK293 cells, the levels of β-catenin1–781 and β-catenin1–422 were decreased whereas the amount of β-catenin1–138 was unchanged by pharmacological stimulation of PKCα. Our results suggest that the association of PKCα with the armadillo repeats of β-catenin placed the Ser33/37/Thr41 residues of β-catenin in close proximity to PKCα, thereby facilitating PKCα-mediated β-catenin phosphorylation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aamino acid sequences 3aphosphorylation 3aprotein kinase C 0aβ-Catenin 0aProtein kinase Cα 0aPhosphorylation 0aProtein degradation1 aYoo, Young-Sun1 aChoi, Yang Ji1 aOh, Sangtaek0 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2014 Aug. 08, v. 450 p.1673-1678dElsevier Inc.x0006-291X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2014.07.0663Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02704naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100006300139245007200202300001600274500002000290520148500310592002801795596012801823650001401951650001601965650001601981700002501997700002302022700002102045700005902066700002402125773013502149856007302284852000902357655001202366IND60744210820221121051433.0210710e202107  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074421082DNAL7 a10.1111/ahe.126772doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIsmail, Sa'ad M.

Descriptive quantitative investigation was carried out on 171 sacra of greyhound`s cadavers and then classified into standard and fused sacra based on the number of fused sacral vertebrae. The weight, length and width of sacrum of sacra were measured. Both standard (59%) and fused sacra (41%) were identified. The average length and width of the standard sacrum were found to be 46.14 ± 2.53 mm and 57.89 ± 3.54 mm, respectively. The sacral length was 1.61‐mm longer in males (p < .01), and the sacral width was 0.46‐mm shorter in males but not significant (p = .51). The average weight of a standard sacrum was 26.54 ± 4.55 g and was 1.18 g heavier in males but not statistically significant (p = .24). Results showed that one‐kilogram increase in the body mass was associated with a 0.3 mm (p < .001) increase in sacral length, and a 0.54 mm (p < .001) increase in sacral width, respectively. The morphological data of the standard and fused sacra provided in this study might help the veterinary community to improve treatment and rehabilitation and help the trainer to design the right training protocol for racing greyhounds. In addition, the results of this study are a step to understand the sacrum’s functions and how the greyhound's body functions and future studies are required to investigate the biological importance of these findings.  aPublisher supplied data  cThe study was supported by Melbourne International Research Scholarship (MIRS) from The University of Melbourne, Australia. 3aGreyhound 3abody weight 3amorphometry1 aMurray, Christina M.1 aStevenson, Mark A.1 aYen, Hung‐Hsun1 aAdamu, James Y.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6018-68771 aDavies, Helen M.

Desorption kinetics of 13 individual PAHs revealed that the soil contained initially up to 50% slowly desorbing fractions. A rhamnolipid biosurfactant was applied to the soil at the completion of the sunflower cycle (75 days in greenhouse conditions). After this period, the PAHs that remained in the soil were mainly present in a slowly desorbing form as a result of the efficient biodegradation of fast-desorbing PAHs by native microbial populations. The rhamnolipid enhanced the bioavailable fraction of the remaining PAHs by up to 30%, as evidenced by a standardized desorption extraction with Tenax, but the enhancement occurred with only planted soils. The enhanced bioavailability did not decrease residual PAH concentrations under greenhouse conditions, possibly due to ecophysiological limitations in the biodegradation process that were independent of the bioavailability. However, biodegradation was enhanced during slurry treatment of greenhouse planted soils that received the biosurfactant. The addition of rhamnolipids caused a dramatic shift in the soil bacterial community structure, which was magnified in the presence of sunflower plants. The stimulated groups were identified as fast-growing and catabolically versatile bacteria. This new rhizosphere microbial biomass possibly interacted with the biosurfactant to facilitate intra-aggregate diffusion of PAHs, thus enhancing the kinetics of slow desorption. Our results show that the usually limited biosurfactant efficiency with contaminated field soils can be significantly enhanced by integrating the sunflower ontogenetic cycle into the bioremediation design.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHelianthus annuus 3abioavailability 3abiodegradation 3abioremediation 3abiosurfactants 3acommunity structure 3adesorption 3aecophysiology 3agreenhouse production 3agreenhouses 3amicrobial biomass 3aontogeny 3apolluted soils 3apolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons 3arhamnolipids 3arhizosphere 3aslurries 3asoil bacteria 0aBioavailability 0aBiodegradation 0aBacteria 0aPolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons 0aBioremediation 0aSunflower1 aJiménez-Volkerink, Sara Nienke1 aGarcía, José Luis,1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7880-23431 aVila, Joaquim1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2212-24741 aCantos, Manuel1 aGrifoll, Magdalena1 aOrtega-Calvo, Jose Julio0 tScience of the total environment.g2020 June 10, v. 720 p.137608-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.1376083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02979naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001700146245012700163520181900290592002802109650001302137650001502150650001302165650001902178650001702197650001302214650000902227650001602236650002002252650001302272650001402285650002802299700001902327700001802346700001702364773012202381856008102503852000902584655001202593IND60790799920221119150214.0220826e20220804xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079079992DNAL7 a10.3390/agronomy120818422doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLee, Hyo Jin10aCrop Cultivation Underneath Agro-Photovoltaic Systems and Its Effects on Crop Growth, Yield, and Photosynthetic Efficiency  aAgro-photovoltaics (APV) could be the optimal means of sustainable development in agricultural areas once a few challenges are overcome, perhaps the greatest of which is the constant shading from AVP structures. This study examined how the growth and yield of rice, potato, sesame, and soybean crops could be optimized when grown underneath different APV systems. The solar radiation, shading levels, and temperatures during crop cultivation were measured. In addition, the photosynthetic efficiency was measured at different growth stages. Adjacent to the APV systems were the control plots with full sun. In these studies with potato crops grown under APV systems, most growth and yield parameters were similar to those grown in the control plot except for the plant height. On the other hand, sesame crops grown underneath the APV systems had a lower stem length, effective branching number, 1000 seed weight, and a reduced yield of 19% compared to the crops from the control plot. In two distant locations (Paju and Youngkwang), soybean crops grown underneath APV systems at both sites showed increased ungrained ratios per pod and a reduced yield of 18–20% compared to the control plot. Finally, rice crops cultivated underneath the APV systems had a lower panicle number per hill, spikelet number per panicle, 1000 seed weight, and yield reduction of 13–30% compared to the control plot. Overall, crops grown underneath the APV systems had a greater plant height and stem length. Moreover, the solar radiation and PAR underneath the APV systems were also lower than in the control plots. The photosynthetic efficacy in rice plants grown underneath the APV systems was lower than in the control plots. The photosynthetic efficacy may help lower the crop yield when cultivation is underneath an APV system.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagronomy 3acrop yield 3apanicles 3aphotosynthesis 3aplant height 3apotatoes 3arice 3aseed weight 3asolar radiation 3asoybeans 3aspikelets 3asustainable development1 aPark, Hyun Hwa1 aKim, Young Ok1 aKuk, Yong In0 tAgronomy.g2022 Aug. 04, v. 12, no. 8dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:12361x2073-43957nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agronomy120818423Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04316naa a2200721 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003800113040001800151100001800169245011800187300001400305520164300319592002801962650001001990650002102000650003002021650001502051650001802066650001502084650003702099650001102136650002102147650002402168650002602192650007902218650006502297650002102362650003202383650003402415650003602449650005702485650001902542650005802561650001102619650000902630650007102639650004402710650005102754650004402805650003102849650002702880650007302907650007902980650006403059650003603123650008103159700001303240700001403253700001403267700001103281700001203292700002503304700001303329700001603342773010803358856008403466990002303550852000903573655001203582IND60097857520221121044338.0141104e20120515xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009785752DNAL7 a224261602pmid7 a10.1016/j.ejphar.2012.02.0402doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPan, Xue-Yang10aGinsenoside Rg3 attenuates cell migration via inhibition of aquaporin 1 expression in PC-3M prostate cancer cells  ap. 27-34.  aGinsenoside Rg3 (Rg3), one of the bioactive extracts found in ginseng root, was reported to have anti-cancer activity in various cancer models. The anti-proliferation effect of Rg3 on prostate cancer cells has been well reported. To test whether Rg3 has an anti-metastatic effect on prostate cancer, we treated a highly metastatic PC-3M prostate cancer cell line with Rg3. We found that Rg3 (10μM) led to remarkable inhibition of PC-3M cell migration. Simultaneously, exposure to Rg3 suppressed expression of the aquaporin 1 (AQP1) water channel protein, which has previously been reported to be involved in cell migration. Overexpression of AQP1 attenuated Rg3-induced inhibition of cell migration, and introduction of a shRNA targeting AQP1 abrogated the inhibitory effect of Rg3, although the basal level of cell migration was decreased by RNA interference. In mechanism study, estrogen receptor- and glucocorticoid receptor-dependent pathways are proved uninvolved in the AQP1 regulation by Rg3. However, Rg3 treatment triggered the activation of p38 MAPK; and SB202190, a specific inhibitor of p38 MAPK, antagonized the Rg3-induced regulation of AQP1 and cell migration, suggesting a crucial role for p38 in the regulation process. Deletion analysis of the promoter region of AQP1 was also conducted using dual-luciferase assay, which indicated that the −1000bp to −200bp promoter region was involved in the AQP1 regulation by Rg3. In all, we conclude that Rg3 effectively suppresses migration of PC-3M cells by down-regulating AQP1 expression through p38 MAPK pathway and some transcription factors acting on the AQP1 promoter.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPanax 3aRNA interference 3aanticarcinogenic activity 3aaquaporins 3acell movement 3ametastasis 3amitogen-activated protein kinase 3amodels 3apromoter regions 3aprostatic neoplasms 3atranscription factors 2aAntineoplastic Agents, Phytogenicxantagonists & inhibitorsxpharmacology. 2aAquaporin 1xantagonists & inhibitorsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aCell Line, Tumor 2aCell Movementxdrug effects 2aDown-Regulationxdrug effects 2aEnzyme Activationxdrug effects 2aGene Expression Regulation, Neoplasticxdrug effects 2aGene Silencing 2aGinsenosidesxantagonists & inhibitorsxpharmacology. 2aHumans 2aMale 2aNeoplasm Proteinsxantagonists & inhibitorsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aPromoter Regions, Geneticxdrug effects 2aProstatic Neoplasmsxdrug therapyxmetabolism. 2aProtein Kinase Inhibitorsxpharmacology 2aRNA, Messengerxmetabolism 2aRNA, Small Interfering 2aReceptors, Estrogenxantagonists & inhibitorsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aReceptors, Glucocorticoidxantagonists & inhibitorsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aRecombinant Proteinsxantagonists & inhibitorsxmetabolism. 2aResponse Elementsxdrug effects 2ap38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinasesxantagonists & inhibitorsxmetabolism.1 aGuo, Hao1 aHan, Jing1 aHao, Feng1 aAn, Yu1 aXu, Yan1 aXiaokaiti, Yilixiati1 aPan, Yan1 aLi, Xue-Jun0 tEuropean journal of pharmacology.g2012 May 15, v. 683, no. 1-3 p.27-34dElsevier B.V.x0014-29997nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ejphar.2012.02.0403Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02335naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001900146245008400165300001800249520124600267592002801513650001501541650002101556650002301577650001601600650002401616650001901640650002001659700001401679700001801693700001601711700001801727700001501745773012201760856008201882852000901964655001201973IND60579985420221118010103.0170907e20170907xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057998542DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcb.7b054812doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiang, Caizhen10aDispersion of Multi-Walled Carbon Nanotubes by Polymers with Carbazole Pendants  ap. 8408-8416.  aFor various applications, it is essential to enhance the colloidal stabilization of carbon nanotube (CNT) dispersions. Here, the polymers with carbazole pendants of poly(4-(N-carbazolyl)methylstyrene-bl-poly(ethylene glycol) methyl ether methacrylate) (PCMS₅-b-PAPEG₇₃ and PCMS₁₆-b-PAPEG₄₃) and PCMS₃₀, synthesized by reversible addition–fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) polymerization, were used for noncovalent functionalization of multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) in tetrahydrofuran (THF), offering efficient colloidal stabilization. Meanwhile, the adsorption of polymers onto MWCNTs was investigated. The results showed that the MWCNTs decorated with these three polymers in THF exhibited different colloidal stabilization and adsorption capacity. Moreover, the MWCNT dispersions could be stabilized for days and their colloidal stabilization elevated with the increase of polymer concentrations. The block copolymer PCMS₁₆-b-PAPEG₄₃ exhibited the optimal adsorption and dispersion capability for MWCNTs. These findings imply that PCMSₘ-b-PAPEGₙ will be a desirable dispersant for optimizing the stabilization of CNT dispersion, making carbon nanotubes (CNTs) achievable in different applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3acarbon nanotubes 3acomposite polymers 3adispersions 3apolyethylene glycol 3apolymerization 3atetrahydrofuran1 aWang, Bin1 aChen, Jianjun1 aYong, Qiwen1 aHuang, Yuewen1 aLiao, Bing0 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2017 Sept. 07, v. 121, no. 35 p.8408-8416dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-52077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.jpcb.7b054813Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02746naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002300148245007300171300001600244520129600260592002801556650001401584650001501598650001801613650001701631650002801648650001801676650002101694650001701715650002201732650001401754650002801768650001601796650002501812653004401837653001501881653003101896653003401927700001901961700001701980700001901997700001702016700001802033773012202051856008202173852000902255655001202264IND60533044620221121075640.0160728e20140912xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053304462DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbrc.2014.04.0672doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKawamura, Kazuyuki10aSuperoxide dismutase as a target of clioquinol-induced neurotoxicity  ap. 181-185.  aSubacute myelo-optico-neuropathy (SMON) is a progressive neurological disorder affecting the spinal cord, peripheral nerves and optic nerves. Although it has been assumed that SMON was caused by intoxication of clioquinol, the mechanism underlying clioquinol-induced neurotoxicity is not fully understood. This study aimed to clarify the relevance of oxidative stress to clioquinol-induced neurotoxicity and the cause of the enhanced oxidative stress. Clioquinol induced cell death in human-derived neuroblastoma cell line, SH-SY5Y, in a dose-dependent manner. This process was accompanied by activation of caspase-3 and enhanced production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). We examined whether clioquinol inhibited the activity of superoxide dismutase-1 (SOD1), based on its metal chelating properties. Clioquinol inhibited activities of purified SOD1 in a dose-dependent manner. Cytosolic SOD activities were also inhibited in SH-SY5Y cells treated with clioquinol. Finally, addition of exogenous SOD1 to the culture significantly reduced enhanced ROS production and cell death induced by clioquinol in SH-SY5Y cells. These findings suggested that enhanced oxidative stress caused by inhibition of SOD1 undelay clioquinol-induced neurotoxicity and was relevant to the pathogenesis of SMON.  aPublisher supplied data 3acaspase-3 3acell death 3adose response 3anerve tissue 3anervous system diseases 3aneurotoxicity 3aoxidative stress 3apathogenesis 3aperipheral nerves 3apoisoning 3areactive oxygen species 3aspinal cord 3asuperoxide dismutase 0aSubacute myelo-optico neuropathy (SMON) 0aClioquinol 0aSuperoxide dismutase (SOD) 0aReactive oxygen species (ROS)1 aKuroda, Yukiko1 aSogo, Masako1 aFujimoto, Miki1 aInui, Toshio1 aMitsui, Takao0 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2014 Sept. 12, v. 452 p.181-185dElsevier Inc.x0006-291X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2014.04.0673Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02592naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094024002200127024001900149040001800168100002100186245006800207300001800275506007600293520113900369592002801508506003701536650001801573650001401591650001801605650001701623650004001640653001701680653000901697653001301706653001601719653001701735700002801752700002001780700002101800700002501821700002101846773019101867856007902058852000902137655001202146IND60230423320221207120257.0150614e20150512xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6023042332DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.14193681122doi7 aPMC44347102pmcid7 a259225312pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWiszniak, Sophie10aNeural crest cell-derived VEGF promotes embryonic jaw extension  ap. 6086-6091.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aJaw morphogenesis depends on the growth of Meckel’s cartilage during embryogenesis. However, the cell types and signals that promote chondrocyte proliferation for Meckel’s cartilage growth are poorly defined. Here we show that neural crest cells (NCCs) and their derivatives provide an essential source of the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) to enhance jaw vascularization and stabilize the major mandibular artery. We further show in two independent mouse models that blood vessels promote Meckel’s cartilage extension. Coculture experiments of arterial tissue with NCCs or chondrocytes demonstrated that NCC-derived VEGF promotes blood vessel growth and that blood vessels secrete factors to instruct chondrocyte proliferation. Computed tomography and X-ray scans of patients with hemifacial microsomia also showed that jaw hypoplasia correlates with mandibular artery dysgenesis. We conclude that cranial NCCs and their derivatives provide an essential source of VEGF to support blood vessel growth in the developing jaw, which in turn is essential for normal chondrocyte proliferation, and therefore jaw extension.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3ablood vessels 3acartilage 3amorphogenesis 3aneural crest 3avascular endothelial growth factors 0aneural crest 0aVEGF 0amandible 0achondrocyte 0ablood vessel1 aMackenzie, Francesca E.1 aAnderson, Peter1 aKabbara, Samuela1 aRuhrberg, Christiana1 aSchwarz, Quenten0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2015 May 12, v. 112, no. 19 p.6086-6091dNational Academy of ScienceswJournal:jnl45680x0027-84247nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.14193681123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03115naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094024002200125024001900147040001800166100001800184245011800202300001600320506007600336520167300412592002802085506003702113650001702150650001802167650002002185650001602205650002002221650001002241650001302251650002202264650002102286650003902307653001002346653002202356653001802378700001702396700002302413700002302436773011002459856007902569852000902648655001202657IND60515075120221207050124.0160311e20140201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051507512DNAL7 a10.1089/jmf.2012.02012doi7 aPMC39292422pmcid7 a241921102pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMajtan, Juraj10aMethylglyoxal May Affect Hydrogen Peroxide Accumulation in Manuka Honey Through the Inhibition of Glucose Oxidase  ap. 290-293.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aAlthough hydrogen peroxide (H₂O₂) is one of the major antibacterial factors in most honeys, it does not accumulate in medical-grade manuka honey. The goal of this study was to investigate the effect of artificially added methylglyoxal (MGO) on H₂O₂ accumulation in natural non-manuka honeys. H₂O₂ concentrations in the honey solutions were determined using a fluorimetric assay. Two, the most potent H₂O₂ producers honeydew honeys were mixed with MGO at final concentrations of 250, 500, and 1000 mg/kg, and incubated for 4 days at 37°C. Subsequently, H₂O₂ concentrations were determined in 50% (wt/vol) MGO supplemented honey solutions. In vitro crosslinking of the enzyme glucose oxidase (GOX) after incubation with MGO was determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Tested honeys at a concentration of 50% (wt/vol) accumulated up to 495.8±9.1 μM H₂O₂ in 24 h. The most potent producers were the two honeydew honeys, whose 50% solutions accumulated 306.9±6.8 and 495.8±9.1 μM H₂O₂, respectively. Levels of H₂O₂ increased significantly over time in both honey solutions. Contrary to this, the MGO-treated honeys generated significantly lower amounts of H₂O₂ (P<.001), and this reduction was dose dependent. In addition, MGO-treated GOX formed high molecular weight adducts with increasing time of incubation accompanied by loss of its enzymatic activity. High levels of MGO in manuka honey, by modifying the enzyme GOX, might be responsible for suppressing H₂O₂ generation. These data highlight the detrimental effect of MGO on significant proteinaceous components of manuka honey.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3acrosslinking 3adose response 3aenzyme activity 3afluorometry 3aglucose oxidase 3ahoney 3ahoneydew 3ahydrogen peroxide 3amolecular weight 3apolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis 0ahoney 0ahydrogen peroxide 0amethylglyoxal1 aBohova, Jana1 aProchazka, Emanuel1 aKlaudiny, Jaroslav0 tJournal of medicinal food.g2014 Feb. 01, v. 17, no. 2 p.290-293dMary Ann Liebert, Inc.x1557-76007nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1089%2Fjmf.2012.02013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02345naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001900146245011500165520135500280592002801635650001301663650002001676650000901696650001101705650001101716700001301727700001801740700001701758700001601775700001601791773012201807856008101929852000902010655001202019IND60790800020221122050411.0220826e20220804xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079080002DNAL7 a10.3390/agronomy120818432doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBi, Chunguang 10aDevelopment of Deep Learning Methodology for Maize Seed Variety Recognition Based on Improved Swin Transformer  aIn order to solve the problems of high subjectivity, frequent error occurrence and easy damage of traditional corn seed identification methods, this paper combines deep learning with machine vision and the utilization of the basis of the Swin Transformer to improve maize seed recognition. The study was focused on feature attention and multi-scale feature fusion learning. Firstly, input the seed image into the network to obtain shallow features and deep features; secondly, a feature attention layer was introduced to give weights to different stages of features to strengthen and suppress; and finally, the shallow features and deep features were fused to construct multi-scale fusion features of corn seed images, and the seed images are divided into 19 varieties through a classifier. The experimental results showed that the average precision, recall and F1 values of the MFSwin Transformer model on the test set were 96.53%, 96.46%, and 96.47%, respectively, and the parameter memory is 12.83 M. Compared to other models, the MFSwin Transformer model achieved the highest classification accuracy results. Therefore, the neural network proposed in this paper can classify corn seeds accurately and efficiently, could meet the high-precision classification requirements of corn seed images, and provide a reference tool for seed identification.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagronomy 3acomputer vision 3acorn 3amemory 3amodels1 aHu, Nan 1 aZou, Yiqiang 1 aZhang, Shuo 1 aXu, Suzhen 1 aYu, Helong 0 tAgronomy.g2022 Aug. 04, v. 12, no. 8dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:12361x2073-43957nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agronomy120818433Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02291naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245013100166300001200297520100500309592002801314650000801342650001601350650002001366650004101386650001701427650002901444650001301473650001601486650000901502650002501511650001401536700002201550700002601572700001901598700001701617700002301634773013401657856008101791852000901872655001201881IND60580771520221118024138.0171014e201710  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058077152DNAL7 a10.1007/s10661-017-6250-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aErarpat, Sezin12aA novel liquid-liquid extraction for the determination of naphthalene by GC-MS with deuterated anthracene as internal standard  ap. 528.  aPolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons are known for their carcinogenic and mutagenic effects on human health. This therefore calls for the regulation of their concentrations in air, water, and soil. Naphthalene as the simplest in structure of the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons is mainly used as a starter material for other chemicals but also has impacts on human health. A method is therefore proposed for the determination of naphthalene in water samples by gas chromatography mass spectrometry after liquid-liquid extraction. The extraction method was optimized to improve the extraction output, thereby lowering the limit of detection. The limits of detection and quantification obtained for naphthalene were 4.4 and 14.6 ng mL⁻¹, respectively. Deuterated anthracene was used as internal standard to enhance the precision of the method, for which a relative standard deviation of 4.3% was obtained. The percent recovery of naphthalene obtained from tap water was ranged between 93.8 and 102.2.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3aanthracenes 3adetection limit 3agas chromatography-mass spectrometry 3ahuman health 3aliquid-liquid extraction 3amutagens 3anaphthalene 3asoil 3astatistical analysis 3atap water1 aÖzzeybek, Gözde1 aChormey, Dotse Selali1 aErulaş, Fatih1 aTurak, Fatma1 aBakırdere, Sezgin0 tEnvironmental monitoring and assessment.g2017 Oct., v. 189, no. 10 p.528-528dSpringer International Publishingx0167-63697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-017-6250-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02987naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001300153245016400166520136100330592002801691650001601719650001301735650001201748650001901760650002801779650001601807650001601823650001801839650001601857650002001873650001101893650002101904650001601925650001901941650002001960650002101980653002302001653003102024653002002055653001702075653002002092700005502112700001802167700001202185700001402197700001802211700001202229773011902241856008802360852000902448655001202457IND60685146520221118051913.0211123e20200610xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068514652DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.1376112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYe, Qing10aImproving light distribution and light/dark cycle of 900 L tangential spiral−flow column photobioreactors to promote CO2 fixation with Arthrospira sp. cells  aThe light distribution and light/dark cycle were improved in 900 L tangential spiral-flow column photobioreactors (TSCP) to promote CO₂ fixation with Arthrospira sp. cells. Solar irradiation model was employed in CFD simulation to investigate light distribution and light/dark cycle in flow field composed of culture medium, CO2 bubbles and Arthrospira sp. cells under actual sunlight irradiation considering geolocation and time. An accurate way to divide light/dark zone based on saturate light intensity and light intensity field was adopted for the first time. When Arthrospira sp. cell concentration increased from 0.1 to 0.9 g/L, light/dark cycle frequency of cells firstly increased from 0.650 Hz to 0.868 Hz and then decreased to 0.117 Hz. Intracellular chlorophyll a content and carotenoids content of Arthrospira sp. cells in TSCP were 6% and 41% higher than those in conventional bubble column photobioreactor. This promoted cellular photosynthesis and stress resistance, which contributed to increase CO₂ fixation rate of Arthrospira sp. cells by 59%. When CO₂ aeration rate, CO₂ volume concentration, and circulating pump power were 0.210 L/min, 15%, and 30 W, chlorophyll a content, helix pitch, and CO₂ fixation rate of Arthrospira sp. cells all reached peak values of 8.769 mg/L, 78.26 μm and 0.358 g/L/d, respectively.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArthrospira 3aaeration 3abubbles 3acarbon dioxide 3acarbon dioxide fixation 3acarotenoids 3achlorophyll 3aculture media 3airradiation 3alight intensity 3amodels 3aphotobioreactors 3aphotoperiod 3aphotosynthesis 3asolar radiation 3astress tolerance 0aLight distribution 0aLight/dark cycle frequency 0aArthrospira sp. 0aCO2 fixation 0aPhotobioreactor1 aZheng, Run,1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7651-57701 aLiu, Shuzheng1 aQiu, Yi1 aZhang, Ze1 aGuo, Wangbiao1 aAn, Yue0 tScience of the total environment.g2020 June 10, v. 720 p.137611-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.1376113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01996naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002000139245012800159300001800287520086200305592002801167650002401195650001101219650001101230650001401241650001401255650002301269650001701292650001501309650001101324650001301335700002101348700001801369700001901387773013201406856007501538852000901613655001201622IND60539158220221118060856.0160815e20140604xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053915822DNAL7 a10.1021/ja501293x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Changlin10aSolid-State Chemistry-Enabled Scalable Production of Octahedral Pt–Ni Alloy Electrocatalyst for Oxygen Reduction Reaction  ap. 7805-7808.  aAlthough octahedral Pt–Ni alloy nanoparticles possess an excelling property in oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and are of great potential as an electrocatalyst for polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs), mass production of the materials at low cost remains a big challenge. By combining the advantages of both solid-state chemistry and wet synthetic chemistry, we developed one scalable, surfactant-free, and cost-effective method for producing octahedral Pt–Ni alloy nanoparticles on carbon support. The octahedral Pt–Ni samples were prepared with different compositions and studied for the ORR property. They exhibit a much improved reaction activity compared to the commercial catalyst. The experiments demonstrate an innovative strategy for preparing shaped metal nanoparticles and make significant progress in the ORR catalyst research.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalloy nanoparticles 3aalloys 3acarbon 3acatalysts 3achemistry 3acost effectiveness 3aelectrolytes 3afuel cells 3aoxygen 3apolymers1 aHwang, Sang Youp1 aTrout, Alexis1 aPeng, Zhenmeng0 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2014 June 04, v. 136, no. 22 p.7805-7808dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-51267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fja501293x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03862naa a2200673 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001700094024002100111024003300132024003600165024002200201024001900223040001800242100001900260245016000279300001300439506007600452506017300528520144800701596004502149506003702194650001902231650001902250650001702269650001502286650001302301650001102314650002202325650001102347650001302358650001502371650003002386650001402416650002302430650001402453650002502467650003502492650001502527700002202542700002002564700002102584700001802605700003002623700002002653700001702673700001802690700002202708700001602730700002102746773009902767856011202866856004602978956013403024961000903158852000903167655001203176IND60006249320221214224408.0160509e20160421xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6000624932DNAL7 a3244982aris7 a10113/624932hdl7 a10.3389/fpls.2016.005252doi7 a10.3389/fpls.2016.005252chorus7 aPMC48386162pmcid7 a271483422pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGazave, Elodie10aPopulation genomic analysis reveals differential evolutionary histories and patterns of diversity across subgenomes and subpopulations of Brassica napus L.  ap. 1-16.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aWorks produced by employees of the U.S. Government as part of their official duties are not copyrighted within the U.S. The content of this document is not copyrighted.  aBrassica napus (L.) is a crop of major economic importance that produces canola oil (seed), vegetables, fodder and animal meal. Characterizing the genetic diversity present in the extant germplasm pool of B. napus is fundamental to better conserve, manage and utilize the genetic resources of this species. We used sequence-based genotyping to detect and genotype 30,881 SNPs in a diversity panel of 782 B. napus samples representative of the major ecotypes and worldwide geographic distribution of the species. Given that B. napus is an allotetraploid, we focused our analysis on patterns of genetic variation that differ between the two subgenomes. Our results reveal a strong population structure, mainly splitting accessions of spring types (SP), winter Europeans (WE) and winter Asian (WA) types. The number of population-specific SNPs was the highest in WA and comparable between SP and WE. However, the SNPs in WE had on average a lower frequency than in SP. Phylogenetic inferences showed a different evolutionary history in the two subgenomes, placing WE and WA as basal clades for the other populations in the C and A subgenomes, respectively. Finally, we identified 16 genomic regions where the patterns of diversity differ markedly from the genome average, several of which are consistent with putative genomic inversions. The SNPs discovered in our analysis are publicly available, providing a valuable resource for the community.  cUSDAdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/1000001990 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aBrassica napus 3aallopolyploidy 3abiogeography 3acanola oil 3aecotypes 3aforage 3agenetic variation 3agenome 3agenomics 3agenotyping 3ageographical distribution 3agermplasm 3ameat and bone meal 3aphylogeny 3apopulation structure 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism 3avegetables1 aTassone, Erica E.1 aIlut, Daniel C.1 aWingerson, Megan1 aDatema, Erwin1 aWitsenboer, Hanneke M.

The SCMH was initially fractionated by ultrafiltration, and the resultant SCMH-IV (<10 kDa) showing 90% of yeast survival rate was subsequently separated into four fractions using ion-exchange chromatography. The fraction with the best antifreeze activity was further analyzed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. A total of 514 peptides were identified, of which a novel antifreeze peptide (Sc-AFP, KAADSFNHKAFFAKVG) with a thermal hysteresis activity of 0.87 ℃ was selected. The parvalbumin-derived Sc-AFP showed an alanine-rich, α-helical and amphipathic character. Based on molecular dynamics simulations, the Sc-AFP could interact with 48 water molecules via hydrogen bonds, and could be adsorbed onto the ice surface through a total of 21 hydrogen bonds mainly linked to the lysine residues. This could account for its antifreeze properties via preventing the formation and growth of ice crystals.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHypophthalmichthys molitrix 3aantifreeze proteins 3afood chemistry 3ahydrogen 3ahydrolysates 3ahysteresis 3aice 3aion exchange chromatography 3alysine 3amolecular dynamics 3amuscles 3apeptides 3asurfactants 3asurvival rate 3atandem mass spectrometry 3aultrafiltration 3ayeasts 0aFish 0aparvalbumin 0ayeast 0ahomology modeling 0athermal hysteresis1 aLi, Jialei1 aLi, Jun1 aWang, Faxiang1 aLi, Xianghong1 aYu, Jian1 aHuang, Yiqun1 aLiu, Yongle0 tFood chemistry.g2022 Sept. 28,  p.134480-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl8139x0308-81467nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2022.134480  aDNAL 7aarticle03202naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100005700152245013700209300001600346520195900362592002802321650001502349650001902364650002002383650002902403650002102432650001102453653002702464653003202491653004202523653004202565700002002607700001902627773009802646856008702744852000902831655001202840IND60628468020221120232847.0201202e20181015xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062846802DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apenergy.2018.06.1062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHong, Taehoon1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5136-827613aAn optimized gene expression programming model for forecasting the national CO2 emissions in 2030 using the metaheuristic algorithms  ap. 808-820.  aTo cope with the approaching POST-2020 scenario, the national CO₂ emission in the building sector, which accounts for 25.5% of the total CO₂ emissions, should be managed effectively and efficiently. To do this, it is essential to forecast the national CO₂ emissions in the building sector by region. As the South Korean government does not currently do this by region, regional characteristics are rarely taken into consideration when managing the national CO₂ emissions in the building sector. Towards this end, this study developed an optimized gene expression programming model for forecasting the national CO₂ emissions in 2030 using the metaheuristic algorithms. Compared to the forecasting performance of the gene expression programming model, the forecasting performance of the optimized gene expression programming – harmony search optimization model has improved by 7.11, 2.05, and 2.06% in terms of the mean absolute error, root mean square error, and mean absolute percentage error, respectively. Various national CO₂ emissions scenarios in the building sector were established in order to better analyze the variation range of the national CO₂ emissions in the building sector. Compared to the national CO₂ emissions in 2016 (i.e., scenario 1: 41,337 ktCO₂; scenario 2: 45,373 ktCO₂; scenario 3: 46,024 ktCO₂) in multi-family housing complexes, the national CO₂ emissions in 2030 (i.e., scenario 1: 37,579 ktCO₂; scenario 2: 37,736 ktCO₂; scenario 3: 37,754 ktCO₂) in multi-family housing complexes are forecasted to increase by 10.00–21.91%. The developed optimized gene expression programming – harmony search optimization model will potentially be able to assist policymakers in central and local governments forecast the national CO₂ emissions in 2030. Through this, national CO₂ emission management that more closely reflects the characteristics at the regional or national level can be supported.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3acarbon dioxide 3agene expression 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3alocal government 3amodels 0aNational CO2 emissions 0aGene expression programming 0aHarmony search optimization algorithm 0aParticle swarm optimization algorithm1 aJeong, Kwangbok1 aKoo, Choongwan0 tApplied energy.g2018 Oct. 15, v. 228 p.808-820dElsevier LtdwJournal:11876x0306-26197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2018.06.1063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02648naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002600146245011000172300001800282520150400300592002801804650001001832650002001842650001801862650001801880650002101898650004401919650002101963650001501984650001601999650001602015700001902031700002302050773012202073856008202195852000902277655001202286IND60579985820221118010116.0170907e20170907xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057998582DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcb.7b059012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWeiss-Errico, Mary Jo10a19F NMR Characterization of the Encapsulation of Emerging Perfluoroethercarboxylic Acids by Cyclodextrins  ap. 8359-8366.  aLegacy perfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) are known environmental pollutants with serious adverse health effects. Perfluoroethercarboxylic acids (PFECAs), emerging PFASs now being substituted for legacy PFASs, have recently been detected in the environment. Cyclodextrins (CDs) have been proposed as agents for the remediation of problematic pollutants, including legacy PFASs. The current study uses ¹⁹F NMR spectroscopy to measure the complexation of mono-, di-, and triether PFECAs by CDs for eventual environmental applications. Eight PFECAs were characterized by ¹⁹F and ¹³C NMR. The change in chemical shift of individual fluorines upon complexation of CDs at various stoichiometric ratios was used to determine the host–guest association constants. All studied PFECAs were most strongly encapsulated by β-CD, with association constants from 10²–10⁵ M–¹ depending on chain length and number of ether functionalities. ¹⁹F–¹H heteronuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy (HOESY) NMR experiments were performed for the β-CD complexes of two branched monoethers, PFPrOPrA (“GenX”) and PFDMMOBA, to elucidate the structural details of the complexes, determine the specific orientation, and position of β-CD along the PFAS chain, and assess the roles of hydrogen-bonding and PFECA branching on the host–guest interactions. The results give new understanding into the fundamental nature of the host–guest complex between cyclodextrins and perfluorinated surfactants.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacids 3aadverse effects 3acyclodextrins 3aencapsulation 3ahydrogen bonding 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aperfluorocarbons 3apollutants 3aremediation 3asurfactants1 aGhiviriga, Ion1 aO’Shea, Kevin E.0 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2017 Sept. 07, v. 121, no. 35 p.8359-8366dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-52077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.jpcb.7b059013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02795naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094024002200133024001900155040001800174100002500192245008000217300001800297506007600315520109500391592002801486596006001514596007001574596005701644596006801701506003701769650002301806650001301829650001901842650001401861650001301875650003601888650003501924650001701959700001901976700002001995700002102015700002002036700002202056700001902078773012102097856008602218852000902304655001202313IND60624940020221207123502.0191017e20180615xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062494002DNAL7 a10.1093/bioinformatics/bty0552doi7 aPMC62486932pmcid7 a294089972pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSaethang, Thammakorn10aAbDesigner3D: a structure-guided tool for peptide-based antibody production  ap. 2158-2160.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aWe present AbDesigner3D, a new tool for identification of optimal immunizing peptides for antibody production using a peptide-based strategy.

The reactor consists of two sorts of spherical particles: electrically conductive particles (large) and non-conductive catalyst particles (small). The main feature of this reactor is the application of electric resistance heating using the electrically conductive particles, which heat the non-conductive catalyst particles and reacting gas inside the reactor. In this work we consider a cylindrical fixed bed, which is 50 cm tall and has a bottom diameter of 10 cm, filled with electrically conductive particles made of nickel and with 1 cm in diameter. The open-source discrete-element method (DEM) software Yade is used to generate cylindrical fixed beds with binary dispersion. Steady-state particle temperatures are calculated based on a new 1D Euler - 3D Lagrange discrete heat transfer model that includes conduction between particles, forced convection and radiation. The design parameters of the fixed beds are calculated numerically based on the current distribution, temperature uniformity and amount of catalytic sites. The ideal catalyst radius is selected to be 0.4 of the radii of the conductive particles, based on the maximum radius at octahedral sites of closed packing. Analysis of simulations based on the electrical current and 3D temperature distribution revealed that the optimal volume fraction of the catalyst is determined to be between 0.27 and 0.30.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactive sites 3acatalysts 3acomputer software 3aconvection 3aelectric current 3aelectrical resistance 3aendothermy 3aenergy 3amethane 3amodels 3anickel 3atemperature 0aEnergy storage 0aFixed bed 0aCatalyst 0aJoule heating1 aNikrityuk, Petr0 tApplied energy.g2018 Oct. 15, v. 228 p.593-607dElsevier LtdwJournal:11876x0306-26197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2018.06.1083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02485naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002800147245010400175300001200279520112200291592002801413650002101441650002001462650001501482650001401497650001401511650002001525650002201545650001301567650001401580650001401594650002701608650002501635650001501660651002101675700002801696700002601724700002401750700001801774700002001792700001601812773010901828856008101937852000902018655001202027IND60580771920221118024245.0171012e201710  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058077192DNAL7 a10.1007/s11295-017-1195-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aÖztürk, Süleyman Can10aMolecular genetic diversity of the Turkish national hazelnut collection and selection of a core set  ap. 113.  aEuropean hazelnut (Corylus avellana L.) is an economically and nutritionally important nut crop with wild and cultivated populations found throughout Europe and in parts of Asia. This study examined the molecular genetic diversity and population structure of 402 genotypes including 143 wild individuals, 239 landraces, and 20 cultivars from the Turkish national hazelnut collection using simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers. A total of 30 SSR markers yielded 407 polymorphic fragments. Diversity analysis of the Turkish hazelnut genotypes indicated that they fell into three subpopulations according to ad hoc statistics and neighbor-joining algorithm. Although all cultivars clustered together, they overlapped with the wild accessions and landraces. Thus, the dendrogram, principal coordinate, and population structure analyses suggest that they share the same gene pool. A total of 78 accessions were selected as a core set to encompass the molecular genetic and morphological diversity present in the national collection. This core set should have priority in preservation efforts and in trait characterization.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCorylus avellana 3aCorylus colurna 3aalgorithms 3acultivars 3agene pool 3agenetic markers 3agenetic variation 3agenotype 3ahazelnuts 3alandraces 3amicrosatellite repeats 3apopulation structure 3astatistics 3aTurkey (country)1 aBalık, Hüseyin İrfan1 aBalık, Selda Kayalak1 aKızılcı, Gökhan1 aDuyar, Ömür1 aDoğanlar, Sami1 aFrary, Anne0 tTree genetics & genomes.g2017 Oct., v. 13, no. 5 p.113-113dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx1614-29427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11295-017-1195-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02926naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094024002200133024001900155040001800174100002000192245008500212300001800297506007600315520122600391592002801617596007001645596007201715506003701787650000801824650002301832650001901855650002201874650002601896650002401922650001101946650001301957650004201970650001102012650001402023650001402037650002302051700001402074700001502088700001902103700005702122700002502179773012102204856008602325852000902411655001202420IND60624940220221207131203.0191017e20180615xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062494022DNAL7 a10.1093/bioinformatics/bty0572doi7 aPMC62488312pmcid7 a294151732pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aUrrutia, Eugene10aIntegrative pipeline for profiling DNA copy number and inferring tumor phylogeny  ap. 2126-2128.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aCopy number variation is an important and abundant source of variation in the human genome, which has been associated with a number of diseases, especially cancer. Massively parallel next-generation sequencing allows copy number profiling with fine resolution. Such efforts, however, have met with mixed successes, with setbacks arising partly from the lack of reliable analytical methods to meet the diverse and unique challenges arising from the myriad experimental designs and study goals in genetic studies. In cancer genomics, detection of somatic copy number changes and profiling of allele-specific copy number (ASCN) are complicated by experimental biases and artifacts as well as normal cell contamination and cancer subclone admixture. Furthermore, careful statistical modeling is warranted to reconstruct tumor phylogeny by both somatic ASCN changes and single nucleotide variants. Here we describe a flexible computational pipeline, MARATHON, which integrates multiple related statistical software for copy number profiling and downstream analyses in disease genetic studies.

However, even with state of the art nanocarbons with highly controlled morphology to maximize the specific surface area, the available energy density remains far below that of existing rechargeable batteries. Utilizing nanoparticles of transition metal oxides is a viable option to alleviate the conflict between energy and power densities by accommodating additional electrons around the surface transition metal sites, called “pseudocapacitance”. However, an understanding of pseudocapacitive surfaces has been limited due to a lack of suitable analysis methodology. Here, we focus on the RuO₂/water interface and elaborate on a reaction scheme including charge transfer into related surface orbitals using density functional theory calculations based on interfacial structures determined under a given electrode potential at a fixed pH of 0. The extensive contributions of the surface oxygen atoms and their surface-site dependence are revealed through the Ru–O orbital hybridization and O–H bond breaking/formation, largely deviating from the general explanation based only on the nominal valence states (penta-, tetra-, or trivalent) of Ru atoms.  aPublisher supplied data 3abatteries 3achemical bonding 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrodes 3aelectrons 3aenergy 3aenergy density 3ananoparticles 3aoxides 3aoxygen 3apH 3asurface area1 aUshiyama, Hiroshi1 aYamashita, Koichi1 aMorikawa, Yusuke1 aAsakura, Daisuke1 aOkubo, Masashi1 aYamada, Atsuo0 tThe Journal of Physical Chemistry C.g2017 Sept. 07, v. 121, no. 35 p.18975-18981dAmerican Chemical Societyx1932-74557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.jpcc.7b025003Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02824naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001900146245011400165520147000279592002801749650001901777650001301796650001201809650001401821650001301835650001401848650001501862650001701877650002401894650000901918650002101927650001401948650004201962650000902004650001002013700002002023700001502043700001402058700001602072700001702088700001902105700001802124773012202142856008102264852000902345655001202354IND60790800820221122035432.0220826e20220804xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079080082DNAL7 a10.3390/agronomy120818482doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPang, Yunlong 10aIdentification and Validation of the Genomic Regions for Waterlogging Tolerance at Germination Stage in Wheat  aWaterlogging occurs when field soil is saturated with water induced by extensive rainfall or improper irrigation, which is a severe abiotic stress influencing wheat plant growth and yield production. At the germination stage, waterlogging usually induces rot of seeds and reduced germination rate and seedling survival. Development of tolerant wheat varieties is the most efficient approach to improve seed germination and mitigate the damages caused by waterlogging. In this study, we screened 432 wheat accessions at germination stage by waterlogging treatment, and identified 27 tolerant accessions with a germination rate of over 80% after treatment. To identify quantitative trait loci (QTL) for waterlogging tolerance, two segregation populations were developed by crossing waterlogging-tolerant cultivars Shannong 135 and Huaimai 18 with sensitive cultivars Siyang 936 and CD1840, respectively. Three QTL qWlg5A, qWlg7B and qWlg2D for waterlogging tolerance were detected on chromosomes 5A, 7B and 2D through bulked segregation analysis genotyped by wheat 55K SNP array. Two, one, and two kompetitive allele specific PCR (KASP) assays linked with qWlg5A, qWlg7B and qWlg2D were developed and validated in the two populations, respectively. The identified waterlogging tolerant germplasm lines, the QTL for waterlogging tolerance and the high-throughput KASP markers, were highly valuable in improving waterlogging tolerance in wheat-marker-assisted breeding.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabiotic stress 3aagronomy 3aalleles 3acultivars 3agenomics 3agermplasm 3airrigation 3aplant growth 3aquantitative traits 3arain 3aseed germination 3aseedlings 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism arrays 3asoil 3awheat1 aWang, Xiaoqian 1 aZhao, Min 1 aLü, Yue,1 aYan, Qiang 1 aSun, Shanyi 1 aWang, Yueping 1 aLiu, Shubing 0 tAgronomy.g2022 Aug. 04, v. 12, no. 8dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:12361x2073-43957nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agronomy120818483Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03016naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100005400152245007000206300001600276520153600292592002801828650001501856650002401871650002001895650001501915650002101930650001701951650001601968650002501984653002402009653001902033653001902052653002202071653003502093653002902128700001302157700002102170700001602191700005402207700005202261700001602313700002302329773009802352856008702450852000902537655001202546IND60628468520221120022528.0201202e20181015xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062846852DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apenergy.2018.06.1122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Luyao1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5311-778810aPrediction of short-term PV power output and uncertainty analysis  ap. 700-711.  aDue to the intermittency and uncertainty in photovoltaic (PV) power outputs, not only deterministic point predictions (DPPs), but also associated prediction Intervals (PIs) are important information for promoting the application of PV in practice, especially when grid connection continues to grow. While there are few studies focused on quantifying the uncertainty of forecasting PV power outputs, this paper developed a novel two-stage model to quantify the PIs of PV power outputs. In the first stage, three different neural networks, namely Generalized Regression Neural Network (GRNN), Extreme Learning Machine Neural Network (ELMNN) and Elman Neural Network (ElmanNN), were integrated using the Genetic Algorithms optimized Back Propagation (GA-BP) method to develop a Weight-Varying Combination Forecast Mode (WVCFM) model. The WVCFM model was applied to generate DPPs. In the second stage, a nonparametric kernel density estimation (NKDE) method was adopted to estimate the PIs regarding the statistical distribution of the errors of the DPPs derived in the first stage. The proposed method was tested using four types of PV output and weather data measured from a 15 kW grid-connected PV system. The cover percentage of prediction intervals (PICPs) were computed under the confidence level of 95%, 90%, 85% and 80%, respectively. The results imply that the two-stage model proposed in the paper outperforms conventional forecast methods in terms of prediction of short-term PV power outputs and associated uncertainties.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3ameteorological data 3aneural networks 3aprediction 3asolar collectors 3asolar energy 3auncertainty 3auncertainty analysis 0aPV power prediction 0aNeural network 0aPoint forecast 0aInterval forecast 0aPrediction interval estimation 0aProbability distribution1 aZhao, Yi1 aChang, Dongliang1 aXie, Jiyang1 aMa, Zhanyu1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2950-24881 aSun, Qie1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6539-845X1 aYin, Hongyi1 aWennersten, Ronald0 tApplied energy.g2018 Oct. 15, v. 228 p.700-711dElsevier LtdwJournal:11876x0306-26197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2018.06.1123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02883naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100003200149245015800181300001400339520155200353592002801905653004501933653002401978653001102002653001402013700001702027700001902044700001902063700002602082700002002108700001602128700002102144700002002165700002402185700001802209700001902227773014702246856008302393852000902476655001202485IND60554749120221121042329.0161024e201503  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055474912DNAL7 a10.1016/j.advms.2014.10.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRuszkowska-Ciastek, Barbara14aThe number of circulating endothelial progenitor cells in healthy individuals – Effect of some anthropometric and environmental factors (a pilot study)  ap. 58-63.  aThe aim of the study was the evaluation of the number of circulating endothelial progenitor cells (CEPCs) in healthy people and the assessment of the variability of quantitative of CEPCs after 6 weeks.The study involved 48 healthy individuals; the group consisted of 24 men and 24 women; the mean age of 34. The criterion for the patients’ eligibility for the study was the absence of diabetes, thrombosis and cardiovascular diseases such as atherosclerosis, hypertension, and heart failure. Neither did the respondents take any medication that could clearly affect the value of the results. In the whole blood samples the number of circulating endothelial progenitor cells was determined using flow cytometry. During the analysis the fluorescence of 100,000 cells was measured. CEPCs were identified with immunophenotype CD45−, CD31+, CD34+, CD133+.In the study, the median of the number of circulating endothelial progenitor cells in the whole group was 0.41/μL. There was also recorded an increased number of CEPCs after 6 weeks, as compared to the baseline; the difference was significant. There were no differences in the number of CEPCs between the women and the men. There was found no effect on the number of CEPCs factors such as: smoking, physical activity and alcohol consumption.The study showed that in healthy individuals the gender had no essential effect on the number of endothelial progenitor cells. Based on the demographic and lifestyle data acquired, it is difficult to explain the increase number of CEPCs after 6 weeks.  aPublisher supplied data 0aCirculating endothelial progenitor cells 0aHealthy individuals 0aGender 0aLifestyle1 aSokup, Alina1 aLeszcz, Monika1 aDrela, Ewelina1 aStankowska, Katarzyna1 aBoinska, Joanna1 aHaor, Beata1 aŚlusarz, Robert1 aLisewska, Beata1 aGadomska, Grażyna,1 aKubica, Jacek1 aRość, Danuta0 tAdvances in Medical Sciences.g2015 Mar., v. 60 p.58-63dElsevier Urban & Partner Sp. z o.o.aMedical University of Bialystokx1896-11267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.advms.2014.10.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02912naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001300145245011500158300001800273500002000291520149200311592002801803596007501831596008001906650001601986650001102002650001902013650001902032650002302051650001402074650001602088650001402104650001702118650001602135650000902151650002102160650000902181700005502190773015702245856007902402852000902481655001202490IND60744211820221121020600.0210710e202107  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074421182DNAL7 a10.1111/1541-4337.127582doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Yi10aMembrane separation processes for enrichment of bovine and caprine milk oligosaccharides from dairy byproducts  ap. 3667-3689.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aBreast milk is an ideal source of human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs) for isolation and purification. However, breast milk is not for sale and at most is distributed to neonatal intensive care units as donor milk. To overcome this limitation, isolating HMOs analogs including bovine milk oligosaccharides (BMOs) and caprine milk oligosaccharides (CMOs) from other sources is timely and significant. Advances in the development of equipment and analytical methods have revealed that dairy processing byproducts are good sources of BMOs and CMOs. Enrichment of these oligosaccharides from dairy byproducts, such as whey, permeate, and mother liquor, is of increasing academic and economic value. The commonly employed approach for oligosaccharides purification is chromatographic technique, but it is only used at lab scale. In the dairy industry, chromatographic methods (large‐scale ion exchange, 10,000 L size) are currently routinely used for the isolation/purification of milk proteins (e.g., lactoferrin). In contrast, membrane technology has been proven to be a suitable approach for the isolation and purification of BMOs and CMOs from dairy byproducts. Therefore, this review simply introduces BMOs and CMOs in dairy processing byproducts. This review also summarizes membrane separation processes for isolating and purifying BMOs and CMOs from different dairy byproducts. Finally, the technological challenges and solutions of each processing strategy are discussed in detail.  aPublisher supplied data  a2017YFE0131800cNational Key Research and Development Program of China  a2018YFC1604301‐01cNational Key Research and Development Program of China 3abreast milk 3acattle 3achromatography 3adairy industry 3aeconomic valuation 3aequipment 3afood safety 3agoat milk 3aion exchange 3alactoferrin 3amilk 3aoligosaccharides 3awhey1 aYu, Jinghua1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9030-72140 tComprehensive reviews in food science and food safety.g2021 July, v. 20, no. 4 p.3667-3689dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:J000000062x1541-43377nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1541-4337.127583Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01980naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002300147245018000170300001800350520091900368592002801287650001301315650001501328650001001343650001701353650002201370650001501392650001501407700001901422700002001441773010301461856008101564852000901645655001201654IND60580772420221118024141.0170930e201710  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058077242DNAL7 a10.1134/S10642293171000882doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPolyanskaya, L.

It is found that bacterial biomass determined by cascade filtration is higher than that counted by the direct method of luminescence on slides by one order of magnitude. This result is because the cascade filtration method for the estimation of bacterial biomass is capable to more accurately calculate bacterial abundance with consideration for bacteria from different size groups. This results in a larger bacterial biomass in soils. It should be noted that bacterial abundance calculated for the initial dilution (1: 100 to 1: 10000) decreases in 3, 10, and 20 times rather than in the expected 10, 100, and 1000 times, respectively. The obtained results are of great importance for the correction of concepts about fungal and bacterial biomass ratios in different soil types.  aPublisher supplied data 3abacteria 3afiltration 3afungi 3aluminescence 3amicrobial biomass 3amicroscopy 3asoil types1 aPinchuk, I.

A simple and commonly used method for crosslinking enzymes to a solid support is the zero-length crosslinking agent 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide (EDC). This work shows the optimization of the EDC-crosslinking protocol for two enzymes, glucose oxidase (GOₓ) and horseradish peroxidase (HRP), to functionalized magnetic microparticles. For GOₓ the optimization of the immobilization parameters pH-value and the enzyme to particle ratio results in activity yields of up to 36%, which is in the usual range for undirected enzyme immobilisations. In contrast, for HRP the activity yield does not exceed 6% even after optimization of the protocols. The main reasons for this unusually low activity yield are the presence of multiple HRP isoforms in the enzyme solution used for immobilisation and the observed tendency of HRP to be inactive even in the case of simple physisorption to the particle surface.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanalytical methods 3abiotransformation 3acatalysts 3across-linking reagents 3acrosslinking 3aenzyme activity 3aglucose oxidase 3aimmobilized enzymes 3amagnetism 3amicroparticles 3aperoxidase1 aWagner, H.1 aRapp, B.

The corresponding composite gel polymer electrolytes (GPEs) are obtained after activating the electrospun membranes in 1.0 mol dm–³ LiPF₆ in ethylene carbonate/dimethyl carbonate (EC/DMC). Their morphology and performance are systematically investigated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), thermal analysis (TGA), charge–discharge tests, and so on. The gel polymer electrolyte (GPE) based on PVdF/TPU/PAN (2/2/1, wt %) exhibits a high ionic conductivity of 6.91 × 10–³ S cm–¹, and its electrochemical stability window reaches up to 5.7 V. Furthermore, the Li/GPE/LiFePO₄ cell shows a first discharge capacity of 167.52 mAh g–¹ at 0.1 C rate at 25 °C. The film also exhibits a high tensile strength (10.3 ± 0.2 MPa) and elongation (102.5 ± 0.2%).

It often requires the application of several computational methods implemented in different software packages, forcing biologists to compile complex analytical pipelines. Here we introduce INfORM (Inference of NetwOrk Response Modules), an R shiny application that enables non-expert users to detect, evaluate and select gene modules with high statistical and biological significance. INfORM is a comprehensive tool for the identification of biologically meaningful response modules from consensus gene networks inferred by using multiple algorithms.

The composition of n-alkanes (structures with C₂₃, C₂₅, C₂₇, C₂₉, and C₃₁) and carboxylic acids (C₂₄, C₂₆, and C₂₈) and their proportions make it possible to determine changes in plant communities of peat mounds with time and can be used as markers for the degree of decomposition of organic matter. In cryogenic horizons, the contents of n-alkanes (mainly C₂₃, C₂₅, and C₂₇) and carboxylic acids (C₂₄, C₂₆, and C₂₈) significantly decrease because of the different botanic composition of cryogenic horizons (grass–woody residues) and seasonally thawing horizons (moss–subshrub residues) and the almost complete stopping of the equilibrium accumulation and transformation of organic compounds in permafrost.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalkanes 3acarboxylic acids 3aorganic matter 3apeat 3apermafrost 3athawing 3aRussia1 aBeznosikov, V.

This study proves that vapor pressure is of minor importance when the sample is dissolved/suspended in a low‐volatility liquid of the same physicochemical character as that of the used solid phase microextraction fiber coating. It is demonstrated for mixtures of alcohols, esters, ethers and their selected representatives by applying a headspace solid‐phase microextraction system composed of Carbowax fiber and sample solutions in polyethyleneglycol. The observed differences in quantitative relations between components of the examined mixtures established by their direct analysis and by modified headspace solid‐phase microextraction are insignificant (Fₑₓₚ < Fcᵣᵢₜ). It is explained by a significant diminution in vapor pressure difference between individual components of the examined mixture in the applied headspace solid phase microextraction system due to low components concentration in polyethyleneglycol suspensions (Raoult's law) and due to strong specific interactions of analyte molecules with polyethyleneglycol molecules.  aPublisher supplied data 3acoatings 3aesters 3aethers 3aheadspace analysis 3aliquids 3apolyethylene glycol 3asolid phase microextraction 3avapor pressure1 aSzewczyk, Joanna1 aDybowski, Michal P.0 tJournal of separation science.g2017 July, v. 40, no. 14 p.2984-2991dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3924049x1615-93067nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jssc.2017003233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02288naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100002100142245006200163300001300225520077000238592002801008650001501036650001501051650002301066650002001089650001501109650001701124650001601141650001201157650001901169650001601188653001301204653002901217653001401246653002201260653001401282653001701296653001801313653002001331700001501351700002001366700001401386700002201400700001601422700001801438700001701456700001501473700001601488773013201504856007601636961001301712852000901725655001201734IND60682858020221118011606.0200204e20200206xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068285802DNAL7 a10.3920/WMJ2019.25352doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTittlemier, S.A.10aDevelopments in mycotoxin analysis: an update for 2018-19  ap. 3-24.  aThis review summarises developments on the analysis of various matrices for mycotoxins that have been published in the period from mid-2018 to mid-2019.

The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of a 7-day intense physical activity intervention on liver fat content in children with obesity. Fifty-seven obese children (mean body mass index: 26.5 ± 3.2 kg/m²; mean age: 12.0 ± 0.8 years) participated in a 7-day physical activity program. All participants were housed together, and their food intake and energy expenditure were strictly controlled. Anthropometric measurements, abdominal computerized tomography scans, and blood analyses were conducted at baseline and post-intervention. Participants lost weight by 2.53 ± 0.85 kg on average (61.0 ± 9.8 vs. 58.5 ± 9.5 kg, p < 0.05), fat mass (16.7 ± 5.1 vs. 15.7 ± 4.9 kg, p < 0.05), and serum insulin (13.7 ± 6.7 vs. 3.5 ± 2.0 μU/mL, p < 0.05). However, liver fat content was increased, presented as liver-to-spleen ratio (LSR) where lower LSR represents higher liver fat content. The intervention increased aspartate transaminase level (29.42 ± 6.78 IU/L vs. 33.50 ± 9.60 IU/L, p < 0.001). The change in liver fat content was not associated with the change in fasting insulin and liver enzymes. Short-term intense physical activity increased liver fat content independent of change in fasting insulin level and liver enzymes. This is the first human study to report increased liver fat content after physical activity-induced rapid weight loss.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaspartate transaminase 3ablood serum 3abody mass index 3achildhood obesity 3achildren 3acomputed tomography 3aenergy expenditure 3afatty liver 3afibrosis 3afood intake 3ainsulin 3alipid content 3aliver 3aphysical activity 3aweight loss 0aliver fat 0aphysical activity 0aintervention 0aobese children1 aPark, Ji-Hye1 aYi, Mi-gyŏng,1 aKim, YoonMyung1 aKong, In Deok1 aChung, Choon Hee1 aLee, Young Hee1 aJeon, Justin Y.0 tApplied physiology, nutrition and metabolism.g2018, v. 43, no. 6 p.553-557dNRC Research PresswJournal:23115x1715-53207nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1139/apnm-2017-04063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02195naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002200149245010700171300001800278500001900296520079800315592002801113650001601141650002501157650001601182650001701198650001301215650001301228650001801241650001901259650002101278650002601299700002201325700002601347700006001373700007401433700006501507773012101572856008301693852000901776655001201785IND60708023120221118125323.0200821e20200807xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070802312DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.orglett.0c022202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVeena, Kollery S.10aPutative Biomimetic Route to 8-Oxabicyclo[3.2.1]octane Motif from a Humulene Sesquiterpenoid Zerumbone  ap. 6409-6413.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aAn approach to expand the diversity of terpenes to novel polycyclic skeletons with contiguous stereogenic centers is described. An unprecedented 8-oxabicyclo[3.2.1]octane motif was obtained in quantitative yield by photoirradiation of zerumbone in the presence of a catalytic amount of Lewis acid. The vital role of light in the isomerization of double bonds in zerumbone, which ensued cyclization via tertiary carbocation intermediate, emulates a biosynthetic route. Synthetic diversification of the phototransformed product afforded epoxy derivatives with up to seven contiguous stereogenic centers and eight-member ring fused tricyclic motifs. The present work sheds light on the possible role of UV irradiation in the biosynthesis of oxo-bridged tricyclic structures from polyene terpenes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLewis acids 3abiochemical pathways 3abiomimetics 3abiosynthesis 3aepoxides 3ahumulene 3aisomerization 3aphotochemistry 3aphotoirradiation 3aultraviolet radiation1 aGopalan, Greeshma1 aMadhukrishnan, Murali1 aVarughese, Sunil1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0712-915X1 aRadhakrishnan, Kokkuvayil Vasu1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8909-31751 aLankalapalli, Ravi S.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8223-76740 tOrganic letters.g2020 Aug. 07, v. 22, no. 16 p.6409-6413dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19216x1523-70527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.orglett.0c022203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03049naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001500140245012700155300002000282520156700302592002801869650004401897650002301941650002201964650003701986650002802023650002102051650002202072650001402094650001302108650001302121650002402134650001902158650001502177650001902192650002202211650002902233650003302262650003702295700001202332700001302344700001402357773012502371856007402496852000902570655001202579IND60666933820221122081556.0190919e20141112xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066693382DNAL7 a10.1039/c4ra10522b2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHu, Sujuan10aSurface charge modification for improvement of photocatalytic H₂ production over a La₂Ti₂O₇/graphene nanocomposite  ap. 60437-60444.  aA La₂Ti₂O₇/graphene (GR) nanocomposite with intimate interfacial contact and a large contact area is synthesized by a facile electrostatic self-assembly approach. The nanocomposite is characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), UV-Vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), Raman spectroscopy and photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy. The La₂Ti₂O₇/GR nanocomposite exhibits the highest H₂ production rate when used in photocatalytic water splitting, with an improvement of 5.7 and 4.9 times relative to pure La₂Ti₂O₇ and La₂Ti₂O₇/GR-H that was prepared without surface charge modification, respectively. In addition, the transient photocurrent responses and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) results indicate that the La₂Ti₂O₇/GR nanocomposite exhibits more effective separation of photogenerated electron–hole pairs and faster interfacial electron transfer compared to pure La₂Ti₂O₇ nanosheets and the La₂Ti₂O₇/GR-H nanocomposite. The enhanced photocatalytic H₂ production rate and photo-electrochemistry activity can be ascribed to the intimate interfacial contact and large contact area between the La₂Ti₂O₇ nanosheets and GR, which help to make full use of the electron conductivity of GR for transferring photogenerated electrons, prolonging the lifetime of charge carriers and improving the rate of water splitting to form H₂.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aRaman spectroscopy 3aX-ray diffraction 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3adielectric spectroscopy 3aelectric current 3aelectron transfer 3aelectrons 3agraphene 3ahydrogen 3ahydrogen production 3ananocomposites 3ananosheets 3aphotocatalysis 3aphotoluminescence 3areflectance spectroscopy 3ascanning electron microscopy 3atransmission electron microscopy1 aChi, Bo1 aPu, Jian1 aLi, Jian,0 tRSC advances.g2014 Nov. 12, v. 4, no. 105 p.60437-60444dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c4ra10522b3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04019naa a2200697 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100003100164245009500195300001600290520200000306592002802306650001302334650001602347650001802363650001102381650001202392650001102404650002102415650002402436650000902460650001302469650001202482650001702494650002202511650000902533650001302542650001402555650001002569650002202579650002102601650001502622650001702637650002102654650001202675650002202687650001402709650001402723650001302737650003702750650003902787650002302826650003502849650002102884650004902905650002002954650001602974650004502990651001603035651001603051700002303067700002503090773010303115852000903218856008203227655001203309IND4437428720221117073556.0190314e201006  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443742872DNAL7 a200332162pmid7 a10.1007/s00442-009-1523-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGrant-Hoffman, Madeline N.10aInvasive rats alter woody seedling composition on seabird-dominated islands in New Zealand  ap. 449-460.  aInvasive rats (Rattus rattus, R. norvegicus, R. exulans) have large impacts on island habitats through both direct and indirect effects on plants. Rats affect vegetation by extirpating burrowing seabirds through consumption of eggs, chicks, and adults. These seabirds serve as ecosystem engineers, affecting plant communities by burying and trampling seeds and seedlings, and by altering microclimate. Rats also directly affect plant communities by consuming seeds and seedlings. We studied the direct and indirect impacts of rats on the seedlings of woody plants on 21 islands in northern New Zealand. We compared seedling densities and richness on islands which differed in status with respect to rats: nine islands where rats never invaded, seven islands where rats were present at the time of our study, and five islands where rats were either eradicated or where populations were likely to be small as a result of repeated eradications and re-invasions. In addition, we compared plots from a subset of the 21 islands with different burrow densities to examine the effects of burrowing seabirds on plants while controlling for other factors that differ between islands. We categorized plant communities by species composition and seedling density in a cluster analysis. We found that burrow densities explained more variation in seedling communities than rat status. In areas with high seabird burrow density seedling densities were low, especially for the smallest seedlings. Species richness and diversity of seedlings, but not seedling density, were most influenced by changes in microclimate induced by seabirds. Islands where rats had been eradicated or that had low rat populations had the lowest diversity and richness of seedlings (and adults), but the highest seedling density. Seedling communities on these islands were dominated by Pseudopanax lessonii and Coprosma macrocarpa. This indicates lasting effects of rats that may prevent islands from returning to pre-invasion states.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCoprosma 3aPseudopanax 3aRattus rattus 3aadults 3aburrows 3achicks 3acluster analysis 3aecosystem engineers 3aeggs 3ahabitats 3aislands 3amicroclimate 3aplant communities 3arats 3aseabirds 3aseedlings 3aseeds 3aspecies diversity 3atrampling damage 3avegetation 3awoody plants 2aAnimal Migration 2aAnimals 2aBirdsxphysiology 2aEcosystem 2aGeography 2aHumidity 2aNitrogenxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aPhosphorusxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aPopulation Density 2aPredatory Behaviorxphysiology 2aRatsxphysiology 2aSeedlingsxgrowth & developmentxphysiology. 2aSoilxanalysis. 2aTemperature 2aTreesxgrowth & developmentxphysiology. 3aNew Zealand 0aNew Zealand1 aMulder, Christa P.1 aBellingham, Peter J.0 tOecologia.g2010 June, v. 163, no. 2 p.449-460dSpringer-VerlagwJournal:jnl44754x0029-85497nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00442-009-1523-63Available from publisher's site 7aarticle02270naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002100140245013800161300002000299520110000319592002801419650001101447650001201458650001101470650002201481650002001503650002801523650001001551650001501561650001801576650000701594650001401601700002101615700002101636700002001657773012401677856007401801852000901875655001201884IND60667213320221119230003.0190919e20150129xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066721332DNAL7 a10.1039/c4ra15909h2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSalama, Nahla N.12aA novel methionine/palladium nanoparticle modified carbon paste electrode for simultaneous determination of three antiparkinson drugs  ap. 14187-14195.  aA simple, novel and reproducible method for the separation and simultaneous determination of entacapone (EN), levodopa (LD) and carbidopa (CD) based on a methionine/palladium nanoparticle modified carbon paste electrode (Met/Pd/CPE/SDS) prepared via the electrodeposition of palladium on a methionine/carbon paste modified electrode is described.

Time discounting refers to the tendency to discount larger future gains in favor of smaller immediate rewards. Hence, lower discounting should lead to better dietary practices and healthier dietary choices. Prior research has shown that exposure to natural versus urban landscapes can induce lower discounting. The current study examined whether viewing pictures of natural scenes induces lower discounting, leading to healthier dietary choices. Ninety-three undergraduates who had the intention to lose weight were randomly assigned to one of three experiment conditions (natural scenes, urban scenes, or control). The discounting rate was measured following the landscape exposure manipulation. The amount of sugar chosen for the reward drink was recorded. The results showed that participants who viewed pictures of natural scenes chose a smaller amount of sugar for their reward drinks compared with participants viewing the urban scene and the control condition. The discounting rate mediated the association between exposure to natural landscapes and a smaller amount of sugar chosen for the reward drink (i.e., a healthier dietary choice). Our findings suggest that exposure to nature can induce healthier dietary choices that may help subjects with weight control. This study provides a new approach to promoting dietary regulation and obesity control via nature exposure.  aPublisher supplied data 3abeverages 3acollege students 3afood choices 3alandscapes 3aobesity 3asugars 3aurban areas 3aweight control 3aweight loss 0aDietary choices 0aDiscounting 0aNature exposure 0aSugar sweetened beverages1 aWu, Wenxiong,1 aChiou, Wen-Bin1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9466-7628 https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9466-76280 tJournal of environmental psychology.g2019 Oct., v. 65dElsevier LtdwJournal:3314x0272-49447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvp.2019.1013333Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02900naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100005200144245006800196300002000264520125300284592002801537650001801565650002501583650001301608650001101621650001101632650001601643650000901659650001901668650000901687650001101696650002601707650000901733650001001742650001801752653001801770653002701788653001601815653001501831653000801846700001501854700001501869700001501884700001501899700001501914700001801929700001801947700001801965700001201983700001901995700005002014700001702064773014202081856007802223852000902301655001202310IND60686771420221116234530.0200318e20200227xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068677142DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.9b209642doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXu, Lulu1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1279-832610aMoisture-Resilient Graphene-Dyed Wool Fabric for Strain Sensing  ap. 13265-13274.  aE-textile consisting of natural fabrics has become a promising material to construct wearable sensors due to its comfortability and breathability on the human body. However, the reported fabric-based e-textile materials, such as graphene-treated cotton, silk, and flax, generally suffer from the electrical and mechanical instability in long-term wearing. In particular, fabrics on the human body have to endure heat variation, moisture evaporation from metabolic activities, and even the immersion with body sweat. To face the above challenges, here we report a wool-knitted fabric sensor treated with graphene oxide (GO) dyeing followed by l-ascorbic acid (l-AA) reduction (rGO). This rGO-based strain sensor is highly stretchable, washable, and durable with rapid sensing response. It exhibits excellent linearity with more than 20% elongation and, most importantly, withstand moisture from 30 to 90% (or even immersed with water) and still maintains good electrical and mechanical properties. We further demonstrate that, by integrating this proposed material with the near-field communication (NFC) system, a batteryless, wireless wearable body movement sensor can be constructed. This material can find wide use in smart garment applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3aascorbic acid 3abiochemical pathways 3aclothing 3acotton 3adyeing 3aevaporation 3aflax 3agraphene oxide 3aheat 3ahumans 3amechanical properties 3asilk 3asweat 3awoolen fabric 0astrain sensor 0areduced graphene oxide 0awool fabric 0ae-textiles 0aNFC1 aLiu, Zekun1 aZhai, Heng1 aChen, Xiao1 aSun, Rujie1 aLyu, Shida1 aFan, Yangyang1 aYi, Yangpeiqi1 aChen, Zhongda1 aJin, Lu1 aZhang, Jianbao1 aLi, Yi1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2092-45051 aYe, Terry T.0 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2020 Feb. 27, v. 12, no. 11 p.13265-13274dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.9b209643Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02904naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100001900154245016500173506010400338506007600442520123600518592002801754506003701782650002701819650001901846650002101865650001601886650002301902650003001925650001001955650001601965650001401981650001401995650001302009651001202022651001202034653001802046653002002064653002102084653001502105653003102120700001702151700002102168700002002189773010302209856008902312852000902401655001202410IND60764033920221207110506.0221004e202204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076403392DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biocontrol.2022.1048372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDrenkhan, Tiia10aPhlebiopsis gigantea strains from Estonia show potential as native biocontrol agents against Heterobasidion root rot and contain diverse dsRNA and ssRNA viruses  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aConiferous forests, especially Norway spruce (Picea abies L.) stands, are threatened by root rot disease caused by Heterobasidion annosum sensu lato (Fr.)

In Estonia, stump treatments are currently conducted using the Rotstop preparation, which consists of a P. gigantea strain isolated in Finland. However, for ecological reasons it would be preferable to use an indigenous biocontrol strain. In this study, we tested new strains of P. gigantea isolated from Norway spruce stumps in Estonia for their growth rate and competitive ability against H. parviporum and H. annosum, and identified P. gigantea strains promising for biocontrol purposes. As viruses may cause phenotypic debilitation in fungi, we analyzed the virome of these strains by high-throughput sequencing (RNA-Seq) and assessed whether the presence of mycoviruses affects their performance as compared to virus-free strains of P. gigantea. Viruses related to members of Partitiviridae and Curvulaviridae, as well as unclassified ambi-like, aspi-like and “fusariviruses” were identified for the first time in P. gigantea.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aHeterobasidion annosum 3aPartitiviridae 3aPhlebia gigantea 3aPicea abies 3abiological control 3abiological control agents 3afungi 3amycoviruses 3apathogens 3aphenotype 3aroot rot 3aEstonia 3aFinland 0aNorway spruce 0aStump treatment 0aWood-decay fungi 0aMycovirome 0aHigh-throughput sequencing1 aSutela, Suvi1 aVeeväli, Viljar1 aVainio, Eeva J.0 tBiological control.g2022 Apr., v. 167 p.104837-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl48419x1049-96447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biocontrol.2022.1048373Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03291naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002400150245015200174300001600326520131800342592002801660650004401688650001901732650003501751650001601786650002401802650001601826650002701842650002301869650001901892650000901911650002501920650001201945650002301957650004301980650001502023650002202038650001602060650001902076650001602095650002202111650000702133650001802140650001302158650001902171650001502190653003502205653002202240653002102262653002802283653001802311653002202329653002102351700002402372700002502396700001702421773012202438856008402560852000902644655001202653IND60122363320221122005431.0150325e20150128xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012236332DNAL7 a10.1080/10934529.2014.9755362doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSaratale, Rijuta G.10aExploiting the efficacy of Lysinibacillus sp.

RGS was observed. Significant reduction in TOC (93%) and COD (90%) was indicative of conversion of complex dye into simple products, which were identified as naphthalene moieties by various analytical techniques (HPLC, FTIR, and GC–MS). Supplementation of agricultural waste extract considered as better option to make the process cost effective. Oxido-reductive enzymes were found to be involved in the degradation mechanism. Finally Loofa immobilized Lysinibacillus sp. cells in a fixed-bed bioreactor showed significant decolorization with reduction in TOC (51 and 64%) and COD (54 and 66%) for synthetic and textile effluent at 30 and 35 mL h ⁻¹ feeding rate, respectively. The degraded metabolites showed non-toxic nature revealed by phytotoxicity and photosynthetic pigments content study for Sorghum vulgare and Phaseolus mungo . In addition nitrogen fixing and phosphate solubilizing microbes were less affected in treated wastewater and thus the treated effluent can be used for the irrigation purpose. This work could be useful for the development of efficient and ecofriendly technologies to reduce dye content in the wastewater to permissible levels at affordable cost.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aLysinibacillus 3aSorghum bicolor subsp. bicolor 3aVigna mungo 3aagricultural wastes 3abioreactors 3achemical oxygen demand 3acost effectiveness 3adecolorization 3adyes 3aenvironmental health 3aenzymes 3agas chromatography 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3airrigation 3amass spectrometry 3ametabolites 3amicroorganisms 3anaphthalene 3anitrogen fixation 3apH 3aphytotoxicity 3apigments 3asolubilization 3awastewater 0aDecolorization and degradation 0afixed bed reactor 0aLuffa cylindrica 0aphotosynthetic pigments 0aphytotoxicity 0aReactive Orange 4 0atextile effluent1 aSaratale, Ganesh D.1 aGovindwar, Sanjay P.1 aKim, Dong S.0 tJournal of environmental science and health.g2015 Jan. 28, v. 50, no. 2 p.176-192dTaylor & Francisx1532-41177nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10934529.2014.9755363Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03427naa a2200757 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100003200147245016600179520121900345592002801564653002301592653001801615653001801633653002601651653002101677653000801698653000901706653000701715653000801722653000801730653000901738653000701747653000801754653000901762653000901771653000701780653000901787653001001796653001001806653000901816653001001825653000901835653000701844653000701851653000801858653000701866653000801873653000801881653000801889653001001897653000801907653001001915653000801925653000701933700007301940700003702013700003402050700002602084700003102110700007202141700002202213700003302235700001802268700003202286700007702318700003102395700003802426773010202464856008202566852000902648655001202657IND60657018420221118005337.0190815e201911  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065701842DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fct.2019.1107552doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRodrigues, Keuri Eleutério10aAqueous Coriandrum sativum L. extract promotes neuroprotection against motor changes and oxidative damage in rat progeny after maternal exposure to methylmercury  aThis study aimed to investigate the effects of Coriandrum sativum aqueous extract (CSAE) on the rat progeny of mothers exposed to methylmercury (MeHg). The presence of bioactive compounds and CSAE's antioxidant capacity been evaluated, and the offspring were assessed for their total mercury levels, motor behavioral parameters and oxidative stress in the cerebellum. The analysis of the bioactive compounds revealed significant amounts of polyphenols, flavonoids, and anthocyanins, as well as a variety of minerals. A DPPH test showed the CSAE had important antioxidant activity. The MeHg + CSAE group performed significantly better spontaneous locomotor activity, palmar grip strength, balance, and motor coordination in behavioral tests compared the MeHg group, as well as in the parameters of oxidative stress, with similar results to those of the control group. The MeHg + CSAE group also had significantly reduced mercury levels in comparison to the MeHg group. Based on the behavioral tests, which detected large locomotor, balance, and coordination improvements, as well as a reduction in oxidative stress, we conclude that CSAE had positive functional results in the offspring of rats exposed to MeHg.  aPublisher supplied data 0aCoriandrum sativum 0aMethylmercury 0aRat offspring 0aBehavioral parameters 0aOxidative stress 0aATP 0aBDNF 0aCa 0aCAT 0aCNS 0aCSAE 0aCu 0aDNA 0aDPPH 0aDTNB 0aFe 0aH2O2 0aH2SO4 0aHClO4 0aHNO3 0aKMnO4 0aMeHg 0aMg 0aMn 0aNBT 0aNO 0aO2- 0aPBS 0aROS 0aSnCl2 0aSOD 0aTBARS 0aTNB 0aZn1 aOliveira, Fabio Rodrigues de,1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2761-34401 aBarbosa, Benilson Ramos Cassunde1 aParaense, Ricardo S.

Although this emerging transcellular pathway enables a better understanding of neural communication, the lack of techniques for effectively isolating EVs impedes their studies. Herein, we report an emergent high-throughput platform consisting of three-dimensional carbon nanotube arrays that rapidly capture different EVs based on their sizes, without any labels. More importantly, this label-free capture maintains the integrity of the EVs when they are excreted from a host cell, thus allowing comprehensive downstream analyses using conventional approaches. To study neural communication, we developed a stamping technique to construct a gradient of nanotube herringbone arrays and integrated them into a microdevice that allowed us processing of a wide range of sample volumes, microliters to milliliters, in several minutes through a syringe via manual hand pushing and without any sample preparation. This microdevice successfully captured and separated EVs excreted from glial cells into subgroups according to their sizes. During capture, this technology preserved the structural integrity and originality of the EVs that enabled us to monitor and follow internalization of EVs of different sizes by neurons and cells. As a proof of concept, our results showed that smaller EVs (∼80 nm in diameter) have a higher uptake efficiency compared to larger EVs (∼300 nm in diameter). In addition, after being internalized, small EVs could enter endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi but not the largest ones. Our platform significantly shortens sample preparation, allows the profiling of the different EVs based on their size, and facilitates the understanding of extracellular communication. Thus, it leads to early diagnostics and the development of novel therapeutics for neurological diseases.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon nanotubes 3adiagnostic techniques 3aendoplasmic reticulum 3anervous system diseases 3aneuroglia 3aneurons 3asyringes 3atherapeutics 0aextracellular vesicles 0aaligned carbon nanotube 0asize-based capture 0acellular uptake 0amicrodevice1 aZhou, Yijing1 aZou, Donghua1 aLiu, He1 aYu, Haiyang1 aLu, Huaguang1 aSwaminathan, Venkataraman1 aMao, Yingwei1 aTerrones, M.q(Mauricio),1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0010-28510 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2020 Feb. 19, v. 12, no. 11 p.13134-13139dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.9b209903Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02640naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002000152245009700172300001400269520112500283592002801408650003301436650003001469650001201499650001601511650002201527650001201549650001801561650002101579650001501600650002101615650001501636650002501651653001801676653003201694653002601726653002501752653003301777653003001810700001701840700001901857700001801876700001401894700001901908700001401927773009801941856008602039852000902125655001202134IND60635618720221119065117.0190402e20180615xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063561872DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2018.01.0572doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZeng, Hongliang10aStructural properties and prebiotic activities of fractionated lotus seed resistant starches  ap. 33-40.  aThe objective of this study was to fractionate lotus seed resistant starch (LRS3) and investigate their structural properties and prebiotic activities. Two main fractions of resistant starch precipitated gradually by ethanol at concentrations of 20% and 30% were named as LRS3-20% and LRS3-30%, respectively. The swelling power and solubility of LRS3-20% were smaller compared to LRS3-30%, and their moisture and resistant starch contents were not significantly different. LRS3-20% and LRS3-30% had molecular weights mainly of 2.0 × 104–4.0 × 104 and 1.0 × 104–2.0 × 104 g/mol. Layered strips and gully shapes were evident on the rough surfaces of LRS3-20%, while LRS3-30% displayed a relatively smooth surface. Both LRS3-20% and LRS3-30% had a B-type crystalline structure with LRS3-20% containing more ordered structures and double-helices. Furthermore, LRS3-20% displayed higher prebiotic activities against Bifidobacterium adolescentis and Lactobacillus acidophilus compared to LRS3-30% and high amylose maize starch. This effect was related to its rough surface and double helix structure.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBifidobacterium adolescentis 3aLactobacillus acidophilus 3aamylose 3acorn starch 3acrystal structure 3aethanol 3afractionation 3amolecular weight 3aprebiotics 3aresistant starch 3asolubility 3aswelling (materials) 0aFractionation 0aLotus seed resistant starch 0aStructural properties 0aPrebiotic activities 0aBifidobacterium adolescentis 0aLactobacillus acidophilus1 aChen, Peilin1 aChen, Chuanjie1 aHuang, Cancan1 aLin, Shan1 aZheng, Baodong1 aZhang, Yi0 tFood chemistry.g2018 June 15, v. 251 p.33-40dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl8139x0308-81467nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2018.01.0573Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02379naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002000144245018100164300001800345500002000363520107500383592002801458650002401486650001401510650003001524650002301554650001301577650002401590650002001614650001801634650001301652651001001665700001201675700001801687700001401705700001701719700001201736773013401748856007801882852000901960655001201969IND60589132320221119152346.0180202e201707  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058913232DNAL7 a10.1002/jssc.2017000512doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMao, Zhengsheng10aRapid and cost‐effective method for the simultaneous quantification of seven alkaloids in Corydalis decumbens by microwave‐assisted extraction and capillary electrophoresis  ap. 3008-3014.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aA rapid and cost‐effective method based on microwave‐assisted extraction followed by capillary electrophoresis was developed for simultaneous quantification of seven alkaloids in Corydalis decumbens for the first time. The main parameters affecting microwave‐assisted extraction and capillary electrophoresis separation were investigated and optimized. The optimal microwave‐assisted extraction was performed at 40°C for 5 min using methanol/water (90:10, v/v) as the extracting solvent. Electrophoretic separation was achieved within 15 min using an uncoated fused‐silica capillary (50 μm internal diameter and 27.7 cm effective length) and a 500 mM Tris buffer containing 45% v/v methanol (titrated to pH* 2.86 with H₃PO₄). The developed method was successfully applied to the quantification of seven alkaloids in Corydalis decumbens obtained from different regions of China. The combination of microwave‐assisted extraction with capillary electrophoresis was an effective method for the rapid analysis of the alkaloids in Corydalis decumbens.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCorydalis decumbens 3aalkaloids 3acapillary electrophoresis 3acost effectiveness 3amethanol 3amicrowave treatment 3aphosphoric acid 3arapid methods 3asolvents 3aChina1 aDi, Xin1 aZhang, Jiajia1 aWang, Xin1 aLiu, Youping1 aDi, Xin0 tJournal of separation science.g2017 July, v. 40, no. 14 p.3008-3014dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3924049x1615-93067nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jssc.2017000513Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03411naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001500153245009400168300001600262520174800278592002802026650002002054650001902074650001402093650001702107650001702124650001502141650002202156650001302178650002302191650001502214650002802229650001502257650002402272650002102296650001402317650001202331651001402343651001102357651001302368653001702381653001602398653002302414653001802437653001902455653002102474700002002495700002102515700002402536700002002560700002202580700002102602773010202623856008702725852000902812655001202821IND60563773920221119205548.0170713e20160315xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056377392DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2015.12.1402doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHunt, Lisa10aInsecticide concentrations in stream sediments of soy production regions of South America  ap. 114-124.  aConcentrations of 17 insecticides were measured in sediments collected from 53 streams in soy production regions of South America (Argentina in 2011–2014, Paraguay and Brazil in 2013) during peak application periods. Although environmental regulations are quite different in each country, commonly used insecticides were detected at high frequencies in all regions. Maximum concentrations (and detection frequencies) for each sampling event ranged from: 1.2–7.4ng/g dw chlorpyrifos (56–100%); 0.9–8.3ng/g dw cypermethrin (20–100%); 0.42–16.6ng/g dw lambda-cyhalothrin (60–100%); and, 0.49–2.1ng/g dw endosulfan (13–100%). Other pyrethroids were detected less frequently. Banned organochlorines were most frequently detected in Brazil. In all countries, cypermethrin and/or lambda-cyhalothrin toxic units (TUs), based on Hyalella azteca LC50 bioassays, were occasionally>0.5 (indicating likely acute toxicity), while TUs for other insecticides were <0.5. All samples with total insecticide TU>1 were collected from streams with riparian buffer width<20m. A multiple regression analysis that included five landscape and habitat predictor variables for the Brazilian streams examined indicated that buffer width was the most important predictor variable in explaining total insecticide TU values. While Brazil and Paraguay require forested stream buffers, there were no such regulations in the Argentine pampas, where buffer widths were smaller. Multiple insecticides were found in almost all stream sediment samples in intensive soy production regions, with pyrethroids most often occurring at acutely toxic concentrations, and the greatest potential for insecticide toxicity occurring in streams with minimum buffer width<20m.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHyalella azteca 3aacute toxicity 3abioassays 3achlorpyrifos 3acypermethrin 3aendosulfan 3aenvironmental law 3ahabitats 3alambda-cyhalothrin 3alandscapes 3alethal concentration 50 3apyrethrins 3aregression analysis 3ariparian buffers 3asediments 3astreams 3aArgentina 3aBrazil 3aParaguay 0aInsecticides 0aPyrethroids 0aSoybean production 0aSouth America 0aStream buffers 0aAquatic toxicity1 aBonetto, Carlos1 aResh, Vincent H.1 aBuss, Daniel Forsin1 aFanelli, Silvia1 aMarrochi, Natalia1 aLydy, Michael J.0 tScience of the total environment.g2016 Mar. 15, v. 547 p.114-124dElsevier B.V.x0048-96977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2015.12.1403Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02674naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100005800155245004800213506010400261506007600365520104400441592002801485506003701513650001201550650001901562650001601581650002101597650002201618650001501640650002501655650001101680650001901691650002101710650002901731653000801760653001401768653001701782653001801799653001601817653002101833700002601854700005601880700006601936773009102002856009002093852000902183655001202192IND60767761620221207082054.0220906e202206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076776162DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2022.1339672doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGreenman, John1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1732-703710aMicrobial fuel cell compared to a chemostat  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aMicrobial Fuel Cells (MFCs) represent a green and sustainable energy conversion system that integrate bacterial biofilms within an electrochemical two-electrode set-up to produce electricity from organic waste. In this review, we focus on a novel exploratory model, regarding “thin” biofilms forming on highly perfusable (non-diffusible) anodes in small-scale, continuous flow MFCs due to the unique properties of the electroactive biofilm. We discuss how this type of MFC can behave as a chemostat in fulfilling common properties including steady state growth and multiple steady states within the limit of biological physicochemical conditions imposed by the external environment. With continuous steady state growth, there is also continuous metabolic rate and continuous electrical power production, which like the chemostat can be controlled. The model suggests that in addition to controlling growth rate and power output by changing the external resistive load, it will be possible instead to change the flow rate/dilution rate.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abiofilm 3aelectric power 3aelectricity 3aelectrochemistry 3aenergy conversion 3ametabolism 3amicrobial fuel cells 3amodels 3aorganic wastes 3apower generation 3arenewable energy sources 0aMFC 0aChemostat 0aSteady state 0aDilution rate 0aGrowth rate 0aElectrical power1 aMendis, Buddhi Arjuna1 aGajda, Iwona1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0682-61911 aIeropoulos, Ioannis A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9641-55040 tChemosphere.g2022 June, v. 296 p.133967-dElsevier LtdwJournal:1969x0045-65357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2022.1339673Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02679naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100003200150245010600182300001600288520116200304592002801466650002401494650002101518650001101539650001801550650002701568650002501595650001901620650002301639650001701662650001301679650001801692650002101710650001901731650001601750650002501766653003101791653002601822653002001848653003301868700001601901700001601917700002001933700001701953773012201970856008402092852000902176655001202185IND60122363620221122005525.0150325e20150128xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012236362DNAL7 a10.1080/10934529.2014.9755612doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTrzcinski, Antoine Prandota10aCombined ultrasonication and thermal pre-treatment of sewage sludge for increasing methane production  ap. 213-223.  aThis article focuses on the combination of ultrasonic and thermal treatment of sewage sludge (SS). The combination involved ultrasonicating a fraction of the sludge and thermal treatment at various temperatures and this resulted in solubilization of proteins and carbohydrates, and so contributing to increased COD solubilization. During the treatment, SCOD, soluble proteins and carbohydrates increased from 760 mg L ⁻¹ to 10,200 mg L ⁻¹, 110 mg L ⁻¹ to 2,900 mg L ⁻¹ and 60 mg L ⁻¹ to 630 mg L ⁻¹, respectively. It was found ultrasonication of only a fraction of the sludge (>20%) followed by thermal treatment led to significant improvement compared to thermal and ULS treatments applied on their own. At 65°C, the kinetic of solubilization was improved and the hyper-thermophilic treatment time could be reduced to a few hours when ultrasonication was used first. A linear correlation (R ² = 95%) was found between the SCOD obtained after ultrasonication pre-treatment and anaerobic biodegradability. The combined treatment resulted in 20% increase in biogas production during the anaerobic digestion of the pre-treated sludge.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanaerobic digestion 3abiodegradability 3abiogas 3acarbohydrates 3achemical oxygen demand 3aenvironmental health 3aheat treatment 3amethane production 3apretreatment 3aproteins 3asewage sludge 3asewage treatment 3asolubilization 3atemperature 3aultrasonic treatment 0aAnaerobic biodegradability 0athermal pre-treatment 0aultrasonication 0aWaste Activated Sludge (WAS)1 aTian, Xinbo1 aWang, Chong1 aLin, Li Leonard1 aNg, Wun Jern0 tJournal of environmental science and health.g2015 Jan. 28, v. 50, no. 2 p.213-223dTaylor & Francisx1532-41177nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10934529.2014.9755613Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02444naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002200153245005100175300001600226520130400242592002801546650001301574650000901587650001501596650001401611650001301625650001401638650001301652650001701665650001201682650000901694650003701703653001801740653000801758653001401766700003601780700002001816773010201836856008701938852000902025655001202034IND60563774020221119205619.0170713e20160315xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056377402DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2015.12.1422doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTiwari, Andrea J.10aC60 fullerenes from combustion of common fuels  ap. 254-260.  aReleases of C60 fullerenes to the environment will increase with the growth of nanotechnology. Assessing the potential risks of manufactured C60 requires an understanding of how its prevalence in the environment compares to that of natural and incidental C60. This work describes the characterization of incidental C60 present in aerosols generated by combustion of five common fuels: coal, firewood, diesel, gasoline, and propane. C60 was found in exhaust generated by all five fuels; the highest concentrations in terms of mass of C60 per mass of particulate matter were associated with diesel and coal. Individual aerosols from these combustion processes were examined by transmission electron microscopy. No relationship was found between C60 content and either the separation of graphitic layers (lamellae) within the particles, nor the curvature of those lamellae. Estimated global emissions of incidental C60 to the atmosphere from coal and diesel combustion range from 1.6 to 6.3tyr−1, depending upon combustion conditions. These emissions may be similar in magnitude to the total amount of manufactured C60 produced on an annual basis. Consequent loading of incidental C60 to the environment may be several orders of magnitude higher than has previously been modeled for manufactured C60.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaerosols 3acoal 3acombustion 3aemissions 3afuelwood 3afullerene 3agasoline 3aparticulates 3apropane 3arisk 3atransmission electron microscopy 0aNanomaterials 0aTEM 0aEmissions1 aAshraf-Khorassani, M.q(Mehdi),1 aMarr, Linsey C.0 tScience of the total environment.g2016 Mar. 15, v. 547 p.254-260dElsevier B.V.x0048-96977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2015.12.1423Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03599naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002200153245012100175300001400296520225200310592002802562650002202590650001202612650001902624650002202643650000802665650002102673650001702694650001402711650002002725651002802745653002802773653001502801653001602816653001802832653001302850653002602863700002502889700002302914700001902937773010102956856008703057852000903144655001203153IND60599062820221118201337.0180702e201401  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059906282DNAL7 a10.1016/j.earscirev.2013.09.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCandy, I.q(Ian),10aMarine Isotope Stage 11: Palaeoclimates, palaeoenvironments and its role as an analogue for the current interglacial  ap. 18-51.  aInterglacials of the Quaternary Period are currently the focus of a great deal of attention within the scientific community. This is primarily because they play a vital role in distinguishing between “natural” and “human” climate change in the current interglacial and in understanding how the Holocene would evolve in the absence of anthropogenic greenhouse warming. In this respect, Marine Isotope Stage 11 (MIS 11, ca 410,000yr BP) is one of the key interglacial stages of the past 450,000yr. The pattern of insolation variability that occurs during MIS 11 matches that which occurs in the Holocene more closely than in any other warm stage of the past half a million years. In addition there is now an extensive range of evidence for MIS 11 palaeoclimates and palaeoenvironments from marine, ice core, lacustrine and terrestrial sequences. The aim of this paper is to provide a comprehensive review of the current state of our understanding of MIS 11. This is the first paper to provide a detailed review of MIS 11 that incorporates the wide range of marine, ice core, long lacustrine and terrestrial records that have been generated over the last ten years since the last major overview. Crucially, it is the first review of MIS 11 that incorporates a detailed synthesis of the high-resolution terrestrial sequences of western and central Europe. This paper, therefore, provides a holistic integration of a diverse range of proxies and archives to provide a detailed understanding of the expression of MIS 11 in the Earth system. In particular the review focuses on: (1) the climatic background of MIS 11, (2) the robustness of the identification of MIS 11 in a diverse range of sequences, (3) the climatic structure of MIS 11, (4) the magnitude of warmth that occurred in this warm stage, (5) MIS 11 sea level magnitude and variability, (6) the duration of MIS 11, (7) evidence for abrupt climatic events within the interglacial of MIS 11 and (8) precipitation patterns and trends during this interglacial. The paper concludes by considering how useful MIS 11 is as an analogue for Holocene climates and compares it with other proposed analogues, such as MIS 19, with particular reference to the “early anthropogenic” hypothesis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aQuaternary period 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3agreenhouse effect 3aice 3apaleoclimatology 3apaleoecology 3asea level 3asolar radiation 3aCentral European region 0aMarine Isotope Stage 11 0aQuaternary 0aPleistocene 0aInterglacials 0aHolocene 0aAnthropogenic warming1 aSchreve, Danielle C.1 aSherriff, Jennifer1 aTye, Gareth J.0 tEarth-science reviews.g2014 Jan., v. 128 p.18-51dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11685x0012-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.earscirev.2013.09.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04096naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100006200138245012200200500002000322520266700342592002803009650001503037650002503052650001303077650001503090650001503105650001003120650002303130650002303153650001103176650001703187650002003204650002403224650001503248650001503263650002003278651001503298651001203313651001303325651000903338700002003347700002303367700002503390773011803415856007203533852000903605655001203614IND60682858720221118011621.0200204e202002  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068285872DNAL7 a10.1002/ecm.13972doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBaskett, Carina A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7354-857410aMultiple metrics of latitudinal patterns in insect pollination and herbivory for a tropical‐temperate congener pair  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe biotic interactions hypothesis posits that biotic interactions are more important drivers of adaptation closer to the equator, evidenced by “stronger” contemporary interactions (e.g., greater interaction rates) and/or patterns of trait evolution consistent with a history of stronger interactions. Support for the hypothesis is mixed, but few studies span tropical and temperate regions while experimentally controlling for evolutionary history. Here, we integrate field observations and common garden experiments to quantify the relative importance of pollination and herbivory in a pair of tropical‐temperate congeneric perennial herbs. Phytolacca rivinoides and P. americana are pioneer species native to the Neotropics and the eastern United States, respectively. We compared plant–pollinator and plant–herbivore interactions between three tropical populations of P. rivinoides from Costa Rica and three temperate populations of P. americana from its northern range edge in Michigan and Ohio. For some metrics of interaction importance, we also included three subtropical populations of P. americana from its southern range edge in Florida. This approach confounds species and region but allows us, uniquely, to measure complementary proxies of interaction importance across a tropical‐temperate range in one system. To test the prediction that lower‐latitude plants are more reliant on insect pollinators, we quantified floral display and reward, insect visitation rates, and self‐pollination ability (autogamy). To test the prediction that lower‐latitude plants experience more herbivore pressure, we quantified herbivory rates, herbivore abundance, and leaf palatability. We found evidence supporting the biotic interactions hypothesis for most comparisons between P. rivinoides and north‐temperate P. americana (floral display, insect visitation, autogamy, herbivory, herbivore abundance, and young‐leaf palatability). Results for subtropical P. americana populations, however, were typically not intermediate between P. rivinoides and north‐temperate P. americana, as would be predicted by a linear latitudinal gradient in interaction importance. Subtropical young‐leaf palatability was intermediate, but subtropical mature leaves were the least palatable, and pollination‐related traits did not differ between temperate and subtropical regions. These nonlinear patterns of interaction importance suggest future work to link interaction importance to climatic or biotic thresholds. In sum, we found that the biotic interactions hypothesis was more consistently supported at the larger spatial scale of our study.  aPublisher supplied data 3aNeotropics 3aPhytolacca americana 3aautogamy 3abiocenosis 3aherbivores 3aherbs 3aindigenous species 3ainsect pollination 3aleaves 3apalatability 3apioneer species 3apollinating insects 3aprediction 3asubtropics 3atemperate zones 3aCosta Rica 3aFlorida 3aMichigan 3aOhio1 aSchroeder, Lucy1 aWeber, Marjorie G.1 aSchemske, Douglas W.0 tEcological monographs.g2020 Feb., v. 90, no. 1 p.e01397-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:19342x0012-96157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ecm.13973Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02338naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245013400169300001600303520094800319592002801267650002101295650002201316650001801338650001401356650001301370650001401383650002101397650001101418650001301429650001301442650002501455700001301480700001401493700001501507700001601522700001801538700001701556700001801573700001801591700002001609700005801629773008701687856008501774852000901859655001201868IND60584682320221117165246.0200419e201801  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058468232DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbon.2017.10.0432doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Huinian10aGraphene integrating carbon fiber and hierarchical porous carbon formed robust flexible “carbon-concrete” supercapacitor film  ap. 500-506.  aAll carbon-electrode is ideal for supercapacitor, but synthesizing macro-level >3 GPa strong porous carbon electrode is challenging. Here, we presented an approach of synthesizing robust flexible “carbon-concrete” films integrating carbon fibers, graphene and hierarchical porous activated carbon. The method involved electrochemically spreading of carbon fiber bundles and in-situ activation of cellulose coating layers. It was found that 10–30 μm large literal size of electrochemically exfoliated graphene flakes could play a key role in in-situ fixing individual carbon fiber layer and protecting carbon fibers from activation corrosion. The new flexible porous “carbon-concrete” film with 40 μm thickness exhibited 5.3 GPa mechanical strength, specific area of 830 m²/g and broad pore size distribution. This light carbon material could be potentially used for integrating supercapacitor energy storage with automobiles.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactivated carbon 3acarbon electrodes 3acarbon fibers 3acellulose 3acoatings 3acorrosion 3aelectrochemistry 3aenergy 3agraphene 3aporosity 3astrength (mechanics)1 aLi, Anni1 aWang, Jie1 aZhang, Yan1 aZhao, Zheng1 aZhao, Huifang1 aZheng, Miao,1 aWang, Congwei1 aWang, Junying1 aZhang, Shouchun1 aWang, Junzhong1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5294-70150 tCarbon.g2018 Jan., v. 126 p.500-506dElsevier LtdwJournal:11670x0008-62237nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbon.2017.10.0433Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02931naa a2200709 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001800152245013500170300001200305520101000317592002801327650002701355650001601382650002301398650001601421650002401437650001801461650003201479650001101511650001801522650001801540650001601558650002101574653001201595653000801607653001201615653000801627653000801635653000801643653000701651653000901658653000801667653001301675653000701688653001101695653001201706653000901718653001201727653000901739653000701748653000801755653000701763653001201770653000801782653001601790653002901806653003201835653002301867653004701890700002201937700002201959700001901981700001802000773009602018856008602114852000902200655001202209IND60635618920221119065018.0190402e20180615xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063561892DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2018.01.0602doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSehl, Anthony12aA critical assessment of transmethylation procedures for n-3 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acid quantification of lipid classes  ap. 1-8.  aLipid transmethylation methods described in the literature are not always evaluated with care so to insure that the methods are effective, especially on food matrix or biological samples containing polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA). The aim of the present study was to select a method suitable for all lipid species rich in long chain n-3 PUFA. Three published methods were adapted and applied on individual lipid classes. Lipid (trans)methylation efficiency was characterized in terms of reaction yield and gas chromatography (GC) analysis. The acid-catalyzed method was unable to convert triglycerides and sterol esters, while the method using an incubation at a moderate temperature was ineffective on phospholipids and sterol esters. On the whole only the method using sodium methoxide and sulfuric acid was effective on lipid classes taken individually or in a complex medium. This study highlighted the use of an appropriate (trans)methylation method for insuring an accurate fatty acid composition.  aPublisher supplied data 3afatty acid composition 3afood matrix 3agas chromatography 3amethylation 3aomega-3 fatty acids 3aphospholipids 3apolyunsaturated fatty acids 3asodium 3asterol esters 3asulfuric acid 3atemperature 3atriacylglycerols 0a2,7-DCF 0aBF3 0aCE 22:0 0aCLA 0aDHA 0aEPA 0aFA 0aFAME 0aFFA 0aFFA 17:0 0aGC 0aHP-TLC 0aLC-PUFA 0aMUFA 0aPC 15:0 0aPUFA 0aSE 0aSFA 0aTG 0aTG 17:0 0aTLC 0aMethylation 0aFatty acid methyl esters 0aPolyunsaturated fatty acids 0aGas chromatography 0aHigh-performance thin layer chromatography1 aCouëdelo, Leslie1 aFonseca, Laurence1 aVaysse, Carole1 aCansell, Maud0 tFood chemistry.g2018 June 15, v. 251 p.1-8dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl8139x0308-81467nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2018.01.0603Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03445naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001400153245013200167300001600299520167200315592002801987650002002015650002402035650001402059650002002073650001402093650001602107650001802123650000902141650001602150650001802166650001302184650001302197650001502210650001902225650003702244650000902281650001302290650002002303650001802323650001302341653002202354653002202376653003002398653001302428653003102441653002702472700001802499700001902517700001202536700001502548700001502563700001202578700001602590700001502606773010202621856008702723852000902810655001202819IND60563774120221119205747.0170713e20160315xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056377412DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2015.12.1432doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGe, Linke10aAqueous photochemical degradation of hydroxylated PAHs: Kinetics, pathways, and multivariate effects of main water constituents  ap. 166-172.  aHydroxylated polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (OH-PAHs) are contaminants of emerging concern in the aquatic environment, so it is of great significance to understand their environmental transformation and toxicity. This study investigated the aqueous photochemical behavior of four OH-PAHs, 9-Hydroxyfluorene (9-OHFL), 2-Hydroxyfluorene, 9-Hydroxyphenanthrene and 1-Hydroxypyrene, under simulated sunlight irradiation (λ>290nm). It was observed that their photodegradation followed the pseudo-first-order kinetics. Based on the determined quantum yields, their calculated solar apparent photodegradation half-lives in surface waters at 45° N latitude ranged from 0.4min for 9-Hydroxyphenanthrene to 7.5×103min for 9-OHFL, indicating that the OH-PAHs would intrinsically photodegrade fast in sunlit surface waters. Furthermore, 9-OHFL as an example was found to undergo direct photolysis, and self-sensitized photooxidation via OH rather than 1O2 in pure water. The potential photoreactions involved photoinduced hydroxylation, dehydrogenation and isomerization based on product identification by GC–MS/MS. 9-OHFL photodegraded slower in natural waters than in pure water, which was attributed to the integrative effects of the most photoreactive species, such as Fe(III), NO3−, Cl− and humic acid. The photomodified toxicity was further examined using Vibrio fischeri, and it was found that the toxicity of photolyzed 9-OHFL did not decrease significantly (p>0.05) either in pure water or in seawater, implying the comparable or higher toxicity of some intermediates. These results are important for assessing the fate and risks of OH-PAHs in surface waters.  aPublisher supplied data 3aVibrio fischeri 3aaquatic environment 3achlorides 3adehydrogenation 3ahalf life 3ahumic acids 3ahydroxylation 3airon 3airradiation 3aisomerization 3alatitude 3anitrates 3aphotolysis 3aphotooxidation 3apolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons 3arisk 3aseawater 3asolar radiation 3asurface water 3atoxicity 0aHydroxylated PAHs 0a9-Hydroxyfluorene 0aPhotodegradation kinetics 0aPathways 0aWater multivariate effects 0aPhotomodified toxicity1 aNa, Guangshui1 aChen, Chang-Er1 aLi, Jun1 aJu, Maowei1 aWang, Ying1 aLi, Kai1 aZhang, Peng1 aYao, Ziwei0 tScience of the total environment.g2016 Mar. 15, v. 547 p.166-172dElsevier B.V.x0048-96977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2015.12.1433Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02540naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002300144245020600167300001800373500002000391520121900411592002801630650001201658650002001670650004301690650001901733650001501752650001901767650003301786650001301819650002501832650001501857700001901872700002101891700002101912773013401933856007802067852000902145655001202154IND60589132720221119152315.0180202e201707  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058913272DNAL7 a10.1002/jssc.2017003642doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBazregar, Mohammad10aImproved in‐tube electro‐membrane extraction followed by high‐performance liquid chromatography for simple and selective determination of ionic compounds: Optimization by central composite design  ap. 2967-2974.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aIn this work, an efficient sample clean‐up method, named in‐tube electro‐membrane extraction, is modified to resolve the formation of bubbles in the extraction process. This modified method is applied for the extraction of two model analytes including tartrazine and sunset yellow from food samples. The method is based on the electro‐kinetic migration of ionized compounds by the application of an electrical potential difference, and on this basis the analytes under investigation, as anionic compounds, simply migrate from the donor phase and concentrate in the acceptor phase. A thin polypropylene sheet placed in the tube acts as a support for the membrane solvent, and it separates 30 μL of the aqueous acceptor from 1.2 mL of the aqueous donor. This setup can be used to solve the problem of extracting highly hydrophilic analytes. Response surface methodology is used for optimization of the experimental parameters so that under the optimized conditions, the method provides a good linearity in the range of 50–1000 ng/mL, low limits of detection (15–25 ng/mL), good extraction repeatabilities (relative standard deviations below 8.1%, n = 5), and high extraction recoveries (54–76%).  aPublisher supplied data 3abubbles 3adetection limit 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3ahydrophilicity 3aionization 3apolypropylenes 3aresponse surface methodology 3asolvents 3astatistical analysis 3atartrazine1 aRajabi, Maryam1 aYamini, Yadollah1 aAsghari, Alireza0 tJournal of separation science.g2017 July, v. 40, no. 14 p.2967-2974dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3924049x1615-93067nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jssc.2017003643Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03146naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002300144245012200167300001600289520181000305592002802115650001302143650001002156650001002166650001302176650002402189650001302213650001202226650001502238650001602253650001002269650001302279650001102292650001302303650002102316650002102337653001902358653001202377653001602389653001502405653001702420700002002437773013202457856007802589852000902667655001202676IND60643924120221119023509.0190514s2018    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064392412DNAL7 a10.1139/apnm-2017-05472doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOskarsson, Johanna10aNo individual or combined effects of caffeine and beetroot-juice supplementation during submaximal or maximal running  ap. 697-703.  aDietary supplements such as caffeine and beetroot juice are used by athletes in an attempt to optimize performance and therefore gain an advantage in competition. The aim of this study was to investigate the individual and combined effects of caffeine and beetroot-juice supplementation during submaximal and maximal treadmill running. Seven males (maximal oxygen uptake: 59.0 ± 2.9 mL·kg–¹·min–¹) and 2 females (maximal oxygen uptake: 53.1 ± 11.4 mL·kg–¹·min–¹) performed a preliminary trial followed by 4 experimental test sessions. Each test session consisted of two 5-min submaximal running bouts (at ∼70% and 80% of maximal oxygen uptake) and a maximal 1-km time trial (TT) in a laboratory. Participants ingested 70 mL of concentrated beetroot juice containing either 7.3 mmol of nitrate (BR) or no nitrate (PBR) 2.5 h prior to each test session, then either caffeine (C) at 4.8 ± 0.4 (4.3–5.6) mg/kg of body mass or a caffeine placebo (PC) 45 min before each test session. The 4 test sessions (BR-C, BR-PC, PBR-C, and PBR-PC) were presented in a counterbalanced and double-blind manner. No significant differences were identified between the 4 interventions regarding relative oxygen uptake, running economy, respiratory exchange ratio, heart rate (HR), or rating of perceived exertion (RPE) at the 2 submaximal intensities (P > 0.05). Moreover, there were no significant differences in performance, maximum HR, peak blood lactate concentration, or RPE during the maximal TT when comparing the interventions (P > 0.05). In conclusion, no beneficial effects of supplementing with typical doses of caffeine, beetroot juice, or a combination of the two were observed for physiological, perceptual, or performance responses during submaximal or maximal treadmill running exercise.  aPublisher supplied data 3aathletes 3abeets 3ablood 3acaffeine 3adietary supplements 3aexercise 3afemales 3aheart rate 3alactic acid 3amales 3anitrates 3aoxygen 3aplacebos 3asports nutrition 3avegetable juices 0aergogenic aids 0anitrate 0aperformance 0atime trial 0awork economy1 aMcGawley, Kerry0 tApplied physiology, nutrition and metabolism.g2018, v. 43, no. 7 p.697-703dNRC Research PresswJournal:23115x1715-53207nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1139/apnm-2017-05473Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03138naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001400147245014300161300001800304500001500322520163400337592002801971650002401999650001602023650002702039650001702066650001902083650002802102650002002130650001602150650001202166650001802178650001902196650003102215650001502246650002002261653001702281653001002298700001902308700001502327700001502342700002102357700002002378700001902398700002002417773010502437856008102542852000902623655001202632IND50067697020221120170220.0150207e201308  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006769702DNAL7 a10.1007/s10811-012-9921-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChoi, San10aTranscriptome sequencing and comparative analysis of the gametophyte thalli of Pyropia tenera under normal and high temperature conditions  ap. 1237-1246.  a2019-12-06  aThe marine red alga Pyropia tenera grows on intertidal rocks, where it undergoes dynamic environmental changes including temperature, desiccation, osmotic shock, and changes in light intensity. Therefore, Pyropia have developed a variety of strategies and mechanisms to overcome those environmental stressors. In an effort to identify the genes involved in the high-temperature tolerance of P. tenera, we generated 368,334 expression sequence tags (ESTs) using 454 sequencing technology and 3,331 ESTs using the Sanger method. Among the total ESTs, 222,024 reads were generated from gametophyte thalli under control condition and 149,641 reads were generated under high temperature condition. These ESTs were assembled into 17,870 contigs consisting of 336,016 reads, whereas 35,924 sequences remained as unassembled ESTs. Only 16.5 % of contigs shared significant similarity with an E value of ≤1E− 10 with UniProt sequence. The 95 different SSR motifs were discovered in 1,586 contigs. Trinucleotide repeat was absolutely predominant (90.2 %) SSR, and GGC was the most common motif. A comparison of the ESTs from gametophyte thalli under normal and heat stress conditions enabled us to identify the transcripts that were up or downregulated by high temperature. Most of transcripts produced under the high temperature condition belong to heat shock protein family and novel transcripts not matched to known genes in current public databases. These ESTs will provide valuable information to identify the DNA markers for the Pyropia species and the genes involved in the molecular mechanism of thermotolerance in red algae.  aPublisher supplied data 3aheat shock proteins 3atemperature 3amicrosatellite repeats 3agametophytes 3aosmotic stress 3aexpressed sequence tags 3alight intensity 3aheat stress 3athallus 3atranscriptome 3aheat treatment 3agene expression regulation 3aRhodophyta 3agenetic markers 0aRhodophycota 0agenes1 aHwang, Mi Sook1 aIm, Sungoh1 aKim, Namju1 aJeong, Won-Joong1 aPark, Eun-Jeong1 aGong, Yong-Gun1 aChoi, Dong-Woog0 tJournal of applied phycology.g2013 Aug., v. 25, no. 4 p.1237-1246dSpringer-Verlagx0921-89717nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10811-012-9921-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02610naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001500150245017700165300001600342520120600358592002801564650001701592650001101609650001701620650001401637650002201651650001901673650001901692650001501711653001901726653002701745653002201772653003101794700001301825700001701838700001201855700001701867700001701884700001501901700001201916700001401928700001701942773008701959856008502046852000902131655001202140IND60584682620221117165332.0200419e201801  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058468262DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbon.2017.10.0672doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYuan, Hong10aRational integration of hierarchical structural CoS1.097 nanosheets/reduced graphene oxide nanocomposites with enhanced electrocatalytic performance for triiodide reduction  ap. 514-521.  aA novel hierarchical structural hybrid of two-dimensional CoS₁.₀₉₇ sheets assembled and decorated on reduced graphene oxide sheets (CoS₁.₀₉₇/RGO) with an intriguing sandwich-like structure are evaluated as electrocatalyst for the reduction of triiodide. In this composite, RGO worked as high speed electronical conductive platforms facilitates transfer of electrons, while CoS₁.₀₉₇ nanosheets as high-catalytically active centers provide abundant active sites for the reduction of triiodide. In addition, the unique three-dimensional structure can also efficiently accelerate the permeation of electrolyte and thereby elevate the accessibility of inner active sites to redox species. As a consequence, CoS₁.₀₉₇/RGO exhibits excellent electrocatalytic activity towards triiodide reduction accompanying with a high energy conversion efficiency of 6.85%, which reaches as high as ca. 95.7% to that of Pt CE (7.14%). Furthermore, CoS₁.₀₉₇/RGO also demonstrates a good long-term stability in I⁻/I₃⁻ electrolyte. The present work provides a rational design strategy to develop the low-cost and high-performance Pt-free alternatives to noble Pt in a DSSC system.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactive sites 3acarbon 3aelectrolytes 3aelectrons 3aenergy conversion 3agraphene oxide 3ananocomposites 3ananosheets 0aCobalt sulfide 0aReduced graphene oxide 0aCounter electrode 0aDye-sensitized solar cells1 aLiu, Jia1 aLi, Hansheng1 aSu, Kuo1 aLiu, Xiufeng1 aLi, Yongjian1 aShi, Daxin1 aWu, Qin1 aZhao, Yun1 aJiao, Qingze0 tCarbon.g2018 Jan., v. 126 p.514-521dElsevier LtdwJournal:11670x0008-62237nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbon.2017.10.0673Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02654naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100005500138245009600193500002000289520159300309592002801902650001701930650002401947650002101971650001101992650001402003650001402017650002202031650002402053700005202077773011802129856007202247852000902319655001202328IND60682859020221118011559.0200204e202002  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068285902DNAL7 a10.1002/ecm.13912doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKe, Po‐Ju1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8371-798410aEffects of soil microbes on plant competition: a perspective from modern coexistence theory  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aGrowing evidence shows that soil microbes affect plant coexistence in a variety of systems. However, since these systems vary in the impacts microbes have on plants and in the ways plants compete with each other, it is challenging to integrate results into a general predictive theory. To this end, we suggest that the concepts of niche and fitness difference from modern coexistence theory should be used to contextualize how soil microbes contribute to plant coexistence. Synthesizing a range of mechanisms under a general plant–soil microbe interaction model, we show that, depending on host specificity, both pathogens and mutualists can affect the niche difference between competing plants. However, we emphasize the need to also consider the effect of soil microbes on plant fitness differences, a role often overlooked when examining their role in plant coexistence. Additionally, since our framework predicts that soil microbes modify the importance of plant–plant competition relative to other factors for determining the outcome of competition, we suggest that experimental work should simultaneously quantify microbial effects and plant competition. Thus, we propose experimental designs that efficiently measure both processes and show how our framework can be applied to identify the underlying drivers of coexistence. Using an empirical case study, we demonstrate that the processes driving coexistence can be counterintuitive, and that our general predictive framework provides a better way to identify the true processes through which soil microbes affect coexistence.  aPublisher supplied data 3acase studies 3aexperimental design 3ahost specificity 3amodels 3amutualism 3apathogens 3aplant competition 3asoil microorganisms1 aWan, Joe1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5950-23530 tEcological monographs.g2020 Feb., v. 90, no. 1 p.e01391-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:19342x0012-96157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ecm.13913Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01720naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002400140245009900164300002000263520058000283592002800863650001500891650003400906650001300940650001200953650001300965650001900978700001800997700002401015700001901039700002301058700001801081700002101099700001901120773012401139856007401263852000901337655001201346IND60667214320221119225806.0190919e20150407xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066721432DNAL7 a10.1039/c4ra15927f2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBormashenko, Edward10aProgress in low voltage reversible electrowetting with lubricated polymer honeycomb substrates  ap. 32491-32496.  aLow-voltage electrowetting on liquid infused films realized with lubricated honeycomb polymer surfaces is reported.

Firstly, OMW was pre-treated by chemical oxidation in a batch reactor with Fenton's reagent, using a fixed H ₂O ₂/COD ratio of 0.20, pH = 3.5 and a H ₂O ₂/Fe ²⁺ molar ratio of 15:1. This advanced oxidation treatment allowed reaching reductions of 17.6 and 82.5% of chemical oxygen demand (COD) and total polyphenols (TP), respectively. Secondly, OMW treatment by anaerobic digestion was performed using previously adapted microorganisms immobilized in Sepiolite . These biological tests were carried out varying the substrate concentration supplied to the reactor and COD conversions from 52 to 74% were obtained. Afterwards, Fenton's reagent followed by anaerobic digestion was applied to OMW treatment. This combined process presented a significant improvement on organic load removal, reaching COD degradations from 64 to 88%. Beyond the pollutant load removal, it was also monitored the yield of methane generated throughout anaerobic experiments. The methane produced ranged from 281 cm ³ to 322 cm ³ of CH ₄/g COD removed. Additionally, a methane generation kinetic study was performed using the Monod Model. The application of this model allowed observing a kinetic constant increase of the combined process (k FN = 0.036 h ⁻¹) when compared to the single anaerobic process (k F = 0.017 h ⁻¹).  aPublisher supplied data 3aanaerobic digestion 3achemical oxygen demand 3aenvironmental health 3amethane 3amethane production 3amicroorganisms 3amodels 3aolives 3aoxidation 3apH 3apolyphenols 3asepiolite 3awastewater 0aAnaerobic biological treatment 0achemical oxidation 0acombined treatment 0aFenton's reagent 0aMonod model kinetic study 0aolive mill wastewater1 aLucas, Marco S.1 aGarcia, Juan,1 aDominguez, Joaquín R.1 aDe Heredia, J.

The study has demonstrated the potential use of this waste using dye Lissamine Green B as a model contaminant, which allowed the optimization of sludge dosage and pH. AMDS proved to perform a high decoloration rate at pH 2, however, acidic conditions favored metal leaching. Alginate gel beads were selected to immobilize AMDS and to avoid metal release and the wash out of the reactor operating in continuous mode. This developed catalyst showed high reliability and efficiency in successive batches. The efficacy of the established treatment was also verified on the degradation of pesticide pirimicarb and a degradation pathway was determined by LC-MS studies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacid mine drainage 3aalginates 3acatalysts 3adecolorization 3adyes 3aeffluents 3agels 3aindustrial wastes 3aleaching 3aliquid chromatography 3amass spectrometry 3apH 3apirimicarb 3asludge1 aIglesias, Olalla1 aPazos, Marta1 aSanromán, Maria Ángeles,0 tRSC advances.g2015 Jan. 29, v. 5, no. 19 p.14416-14424dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c4ra15934a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02902naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094024002200127024001900149040001800168100001200186245011200198300002000310506007600330520117800406592002801584506003701612650002201649650002601671650002101697650002401718650001001742650002201752650004201774650001901816650001201835650001401847650001401861650003501875651001001910653001201920653001301932653001101945653002401956653002001980700001902000700001802019700002102037700001602058700002202074773017602096856007902272852000902351655001202360IND60178489320221207120211.0150604e20131217xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6017848932DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.13210241102doi7 aPMC38707582pmcid7 a242979362pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Jun10aGenome-block expression-assisted association studies discover malaria resistance genes in Anopheles gambiae  ap. 20675-20680.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe malaria parasite-resistance island (PRI) of the African mosquito vector, Anopheles gambiae , was mapped to five genomic regions containing 80 genes, using coexpression patterns of genomic blocks. High-throughput sequencing identified 347 nonsynonymous single-nucleotide polymorphisms within these genes in mosquitoes from malaria-endemic areas in Kenya. Direct association studies between nonsynonymous single-nucleotide polymorphisms and Plasmodium falciparum infection identified three naturally occurring genetic variations in each of three genes (An. gambiae adenosine deaminase , fibrinogen-related protein 30 , and fibrinogen-related protein 1) that were associated significantly with parasite infection. A role for these genes in the resistance phenotype was confirmed by RNA interference knockdown assays. Silencing fibrinogen-related protein 30 increased parasite infection significantly, whereas ablation of fibrinogen-related protein 1 transcripts resulted in mosquitoes nearly free of parasites. The discovered genes and single-nucleotide polymorphisms are anticipated to be useful in the development of tools for malaria control in endemic areas in Africa.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aAnopheles gambiae 3aPlasmodium falciparum 3aRNA interference 3aadenosine deaminase 3agenes 3agenetic variation 3ahigh-throughput nucleotide sequencing 3ainsect vectors 3amalaria 3aparasites 3aphenotype 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism 3aKenya 0asynteny 0agenomics 0atraits 0achromosomal domains 0agene expression1 aWang, Xiaohong1 aZhang, Genwei1 aGithure, John I.1 aYan, Guiyun1 aJames, Anthony A.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2013 Dec. 17, v. 110, no. 51 p.20675-20680dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.13210241103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03022naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002400150245013700174300001600311520152100327592002801848650001401876650003601890650001301926650001201939650003101951650001801982650002302000650001402023650002402037650002602061653005002087653002402137653003602161700002802197700002802225700002402253700006502277700006202342773009002404856008502494852000902579655001202588IND60657019620221118005424.0190923e201910  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065701962DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biochi.2019.08.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEronina, Tatiana B.10aComparative effects of trehalose and 2-hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin on aggregation of UV-irradiated muscle glycogen phosphorylase b  ap. 196-205.  aChemical chaperones are a class of small molecules which enhance folding and prevent aggregation of proteins. Investigation of their effects on the processes of protein aggregation is of importance for further understanding of implication of protein aggregation in neurodegenerative diseases, as well as for solving biotechnological tasks. The effects of chemical chaperones trehalose and 2-hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin (HP-β-CD) on the kinetics of aggregation of UV-irradiated muscle glycogen phosphorylase b (UV-Phb) at 37 °C have been studied. The process of thermal aggregation of UV-Phb includes a slow stage of structural reorganization of the UV-Phb molecule, nucleation stage and fast attachment of structurally reorganized UV-Phb molecules to nuclei formed during the nucleation stage. It was shown that both trehalose and HP-β-CD increased the duration of the nucleation phase and slowed down the rate of structural reorganization of the UV-Phb molecule. This conclusion has been confirmed by the circular dichroism data. In the absence of chaperones, 82% UV-Phb aggregates, whereas in the presence of HP-β-CD or trehalose the portion of aggregated protein decreases to 70 and 66%, respectively. The data on analytical ultracentrifugation demonstrated that in the presence of these additives the size of protein aggregates decreased. Analysis of the combined effect of trehalose and HP-β-CD on UV-Phb aggregation showed that protein aggregation was independently affected by trehalose and HP-β-CD.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadditives 3acircular dichroism spectroscopy 3aglycogen 3amuscles 3aneurodegenerative diseases 3aphosphorylase 3aprotein aggregates 3atrehalose 3aultracentrifugation 3aultraviolet radiation 0aUV-Irradiated muscle glycogen phosphorylase b 0aThermal aggregation 0a2-Hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin1 aMikhaylova, Valeriya V.1 aChebotareva, Natalia A.1 aShubin, Vladimir V.1 aSluchanko, Nikolai N.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8608-14161 aKurganov, Boris I.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2930-22860 tBiochimie.g2019 Oct., v. 165 p.196-205dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6254x0300-90847nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biochi.2019.08.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03212naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001600144245014600160300001600306500002000322520181400342592002802156650002102184650001302205650001102218650002302229650002102252650004302273650001102316650001302327650004402340650002302384650001502407650002902422650004402451700001802495700001702513700001802530700001202548773013102560856007802691852000902769655001202778IND60589133420221119152633.0180202e201701  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058913342DNAL7 a10.1002/jssc.2016009952doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Guoyan10aIsolation, purification, and identification of the main phenolic compounds from leaves of celery (Apium graveolens L. var. dulce Mill./Pers.)  ap. 472-479.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aWe developed a simple and meaningful preparative method for the separation and purification of the main phenolic compounds from the leaves of celery (Apium graveolens L. var. dulce Mill./Pers.) and we established an accurate and specific analytical method for the identification of the main phenolic compounds from celery leaves.

Their purities were measured by using high‐performance liquid chromatography, and their chemical structures were confirmed using UV spectrophotometry, ultra high performance liquid chromatography with quadrupole time‐of‐flight tandem mass spectrometry, and NMR spectroscopy. Our studies indicate that preparative high‐performance liquid chromatography combined with polyamide resin is a simple and meaningful preparative method for the separation and purification of phenolic compounds from the leaves of celery or other plants, and the use of UV spectrophotometry, ultra high performance liquid chromatography with quadrupole time‐of‐flight tandem mass spectrometry, and NMR spectroscopy is an accurate and specific analytical method for the identification of phenolic compounds.  aPublisher supplied data 3aApium graveolens 3aapigenin 3acelery 3achemical structure 3achlorogenic acid 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3aleaves 3aluteolin 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aphenolic compounds 3apolyamides 3atandem mass spectrometry 3aultra-performance liquid chromatography1 aZhuang, Linwu1 aSong, Dandan1 aLu, Chunliang1 aXu, Xin0 tJournal of separation science.g2017 Jan., v. 40, no. 2 p.472-479dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3924049x1615-93067nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jssc.2016009953Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03117naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245011500165300001600280520161700296592002801913650002401941650000901965650001901974650001801993650001502011650001502026650002402041650002202065650001102087650001002098650001402108653002302122653002402145653002002169653001802189653002002207700005702227700002202284700002102306700002002327700002402347700006002371773011302431856008202544852000902626655001202635IND60764035320221119000621.0220314e202203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076403532DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fsi.2022.01.0312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSharba, Sinan10aRainbow trout gastrointestinal mucus, mucin production, mucin glycosylation and response to lipopolysaccharide  ap. 181-190.  aMucus, whereof the highly glycosylated mucins are a major component, protects the epithelial mucosal surfaces. The aim of this study was to characterize the rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) gastrointestinal mucus barrier function, mucin production, glycosylation and response to lipopolysaccharide. Both gastric and intestinal mucus was thick and impenetrable to bacteria-sized beads ex vivo. The secreted mucus covering the gastric epithelium predominantly contained sialylated mucins. Plume-like structures emerging from the gastric pits were both sialylated and fucosylated, indicating heterogeneity in gastric mucus secreted by the surface mucus cells and gland secretory cells, whereas intestinal mucus appeared more homogenous. In vivo metabolic mucin labelling revealed regional differences in mucin production and basal to apical transport, while lipopolysaccharide stimulation increased the rate of mucin production and basal to apical transport in both stomach and intestine. Using mass spectrometry, 34 mucin O-glycans were identified, with ∼70% of the relative abundance being sialylated, ∼40% di-sialylated and 20–25% fucosylated. No effects of lipopolysaccharide treatment were apparent regarding O-glycan repertoires, relative abundance of components, size distribution or core structures. Thus, the mucus production and organization differ between epithelial sites but provide a barrier to bacteria in both stomach and intestine. Furthermore, mucin production and basal to apical transport was stimulated by lipopolysaccharide in all regions, suggesting a mechanism to combat infections.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOncorhynchus mykiss 3afish 3agastric mucosa 3aglycosylation 3aimmunology 3aintestines 3alipopolysaccharides 3amass spectrometry 3amucins 3amucus 3ashellfish 0aEpithelial surface 0aMetabolic labelling 0aMucosal defense 0aMucus barrier 0aMucus structure1 aSundh, Henrik1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1459-54501 aSundell, Kristina1 aBenktander, John1 aSantos, Licinia1 aBirchenough, George1 aLindén, Sara K.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7751-95860 tFish & shellfish immunology.g2022 Mar., v. 122 p.181-190dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl4175048x1050-46487nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fsi.2022.01.0313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02372naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094024002200122024001900144040001800163100001300181245007600194300001600270500002000286506007600306520115400382592002801536506003701564650001301601650002001614650002201634650001001656650001101666650001501677650002401692650001701716700001801733700001801751700001701769773009301786856007401879852000901953655001201962IND60580769320221207144107.0170929e201709  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058076932DNAL7 a10.1111/biom.126552doi7 aPMC55820262pmcid7 a282571422pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDeng, Yu10aProportional hazards model with a change point for clustered event data  ap. 835-845.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aIn many epidemiology studies, family data with survival endpoints are collected to investigate the association between risk factors and disease incidence. Sometimes the risk of the disease may change when a certain risk factor exceeds a certain threshold. Finding this threshold value could be important for disease risk prediction and diseases prevention. In this work, we propose a change‐point proportional hazards model for clustered event data. The model incorporates the unknown threshold of a continuous variable as a change point in the regression. The marginal pseudo‐partial likelihood functions are maximized for estimating the regression coefficients and the unknown change point. We develop a supremum test based on robust score statistics to test the existence of the change point. The inference for the change point is based on the m out of n bootstrap. We establish the consistency and asymptotic distributions of the proposed estimators. The finite‐sample performance of the proposed method is demonstrated via extensive simulation studies. Finally, the Strong Heart Family Study dataset is analyzed to illustrate the methods.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abiometry 3adata collection 3adisease incidence 3aheart 3amodels 3aprediction 3aregression analysis 3arisk factors1 aZeng, Donglin1 aZhao, Jinying1 aCai, Jianwen0 tBiometrics.g2017 Sept., v. 73, no. 3 p.835-845dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltdx0006-341X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/biom.126553Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03198naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002400149245013500173520178000308592002802088650003802116650001602154650002202170650002102192650002902213650002302242650002302265650002202288650002602310650002402336650001102360650001502371650002202386651001202408700002602420700002102446700002702467700002302494700002102517773013302538856008402671852000902755655001202764IND60790797820221119150024.0220826e20220805xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079079782DNAL7 a10.3390/agriculture120811682doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEl Hachimi, Jaouad 10aCombination of Sentinel-2 Satellite Images and Meteorological Data for Crop Water Requirements Estimation in Intensive Agriculture  aIn arid and semi-arid regions, agriculture is an important element of the national economy, but this sector is a large consumer of water. In a context of high pressure on water resources, appropriate management is required. In semi-arid, intensive agricultural systems, such as the Tadla irrigated perimeter in central Morocco, a large amount of water is lost by evapotranspiration (ET), and farmers need an effective decision support system for good irrigation management. The main objective of this study was to combine a high spatial resolution Sentinel-2 satellite and meteorological data for estimating crop water requirements in the irrigated perimeter of Tadla and qualifying its irrigation strategy. The dual approach of the FAO-56 (Food and Agriculture Organization) model, based on the modulation of evaporative demand, was used for the estimation of crop water requirements. Sentinel-2A temporal images were used for crop type mapping and deriving the basal crop coefficient (Kcb) based on NDVI data. Meteorological data were also used in crop water requirement simulation, using SAMIR (satellite monitoring of irrigation) software. The results allowed for the spatialization of crop water requirements on a large area of irrigated crops during the 2016–2017 agricultural season. In general, the crops’ requirement for water is at its maximum during the months of March and April, and the critical period starts from February for most crops. Maps of water requirements were developed. They showed the variability over time of crop development and their estimated water requirements. The results obtained constitute an important indicator of how water should be distributed over the area in order to improve the efficiency of the irrigation scheduling strategy.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFood and Agriculture Organization 3aagriculture 3acomputer software 3acrop coefficient 3adecision support systems 3aevaporative demand 3aevapotranspiration 3aintensive farming 3airrigation management 3ameteorological data 3amodels 3asatellites 3awater requirement 3aMorocco1 aEl Harti, Abderrazak 1 aLhissou, Rachid 1 aOuzemou, Jamal-Eddine 1 aChakouri, Mohcine 1 aJellouli, Amine 0 tAgriculture (Basel).g2022 Aug. 05, v. 12, no. 8dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:12387x2077-04727nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agriculture120811683Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02941naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100005900140245009500199500002000294520147000314592002801784596003701812650003401849650001401883650001601897650002501913650001001938650001701948650001801965650001101983650001601994650002302010650001102033650001702044650002002061650001602081650001202097650004402109650002802153700002202181700002402203700001802227773014302245856007402388852000902462655001202471IND60633663020221120132310.0190321e201903  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063366302DNAL7 a10.1111/jfpp.138942doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMancini, Simone1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8643-507X10aEffects of garlic powder and salt additions in rabbit meat burgers: Preliminary evaluation  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe effects of garlic powder and salt were assessed on physical–chemical traits, antioxidant capacity and lipid peroxidation of rabbit burgers. Four type of burgers were formulated (only meat—control; 0.25% of garlic powder; 1% of salt; 0.25% of garlic powder, and 1% of salt). Burgers were analyzed both as raw and cooked products. Garlic powder modified partially the color of the burgers and increased partially the antioxidant capacity (DPPH) of the raw samples. Addition of salt modified the color and induced an increase in lipid peroxidation (TBARS) in raw burgers. No differences were highlighted in antioxidant capacity and in lipid peroxidation of cooked burgers. The burgers with both garlic powder and salt showed mixed results. Mixing garlic powder and salt could be a potential practical application as results partially showed that garlic could contrast the negative effective of the salt. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: Rabbit meat has a great potential as food for its high nutritional value and digestibility, due to its high content of protein and amino acids, with an important biological value and for its low content of fat and high percentage of unsaturated fatty acids. New products that could easily meet the consumers’ behavior are needed in this sector to ensure future prospective and renew a meat that nowadays is less eaten. Ingredients and additives could play a major role in the product stability and could enhance its acceptability.  aPublisher supplied data  aPRA_2017_43cUniversità di Pisa 3a2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl 3aadditives 3aamino acids 3aantioxidant activity 3acolor 3acooked foods 3adigestibility 3agarlic 3aingredients 3alipid peroxidation 3amixing 3anew products 3anutritive value 3arabbit meat 3arabbits 3athiobarbituric acid-reactive substances 3aunsaturated fatty acids1 aNuvoloni, Roberta1 aPedonese, Francesca1 aPaci, Gisella0 tJournal of food processing and preservation.g2019 Mar., v. 43, no. 3 p.e13894-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl45214x0145-88927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jfpp.138943Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02121naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100005800151245011000209300001800319520084700337592002801184596005301212596005901265650001901324650002401343650002201367650003101389650001701420650001601437700001901453700002701472700002201499700002201521773012101543856008601664852000901750655001201759IND60624937920221118211546.0191017e20180615xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062493792DNAL7 a10.1093/bioinformatics/bty0332doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTamiola, Kamil1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0829-061510apepKalc: scalable and comprehensive calculation of electrostatic interactions in random coil polypeptides  ap. 2053-2060.  aPolypeptide sequence length is the single dominant factor hampering the effectiveness of currently available software tools for de novo calculation of amino acid-specific protonation constants in disordered polypeptides.

Our objective was to study the mechanisms of action of flax (Linum usitatissimum) phenolic compounds to prevent membrane lipid oxidation. To do so, several biophysical techniques (oxidative stress, surface tension, fluorescence spectroscopy and HPLC) were used to investigate the ability of the compounds to prevent lipid oxidation and to interact with membranes. We evidenced a relationship between the structure and the antioxidant efficiency as aglycone compounds were significantly more efficient (p < 0.05) than glucoside compounds. In addition, our results revealed that aglycone lignans spontaneously penetrated the membrane contrary to aglycone hydroxycinnamic acids. To conclude, the comparison of the antioxidant efficiencies revealed that membrane inserted compounds better inhibited lipid oxidation than non-inserted compounds.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLinum usitatissimum 3acoumaric acids 3aflax 3afluorescence emission spectroscopy 3aglucosides 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3alignans 3alipid peroxidation 3amechanism of action 3aoxidative stress 3apolyunsaturated fatty acids 3areactive oxygen species 3asurface tension 0aFlaxseed 0aPhenolic compounds 0aAntioxidant 0aLipid oxidation 0aModel membranes1 aQuéro, Anthony1 aVerdu, Margaux1 aSong, Yiming1 aMolinié, Roland1 aMathiron, David1 aPilard, Serge1 aMesnard, François1 aMorandat, Sandrine1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7948-317X0 tFood chemistry.g2019 Feb. 15, v. 274 p.651-658dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl8139x0308-81467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2018.08.1263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02578naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003800113040001800151100001800169245009900187300001600286520091800302592002801220650001801248650001001266650003001276650001401306650000901320650001001329650003501339650001101374650001101385650000901396650003001405650002201435650001201457650002301469650004501492650005701537650001101594650001801605650001101623650005601634650000901690650002101699650005101720650002401771700001501795773011001810856008401920990002302004852000902027655001202036IND60097856020221122113615.0141104e20120515xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009785602DNAL7 a224493762pmid7 a10.1016/j.ejphar.2012.03.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDong, Zhaohui10aPrevention of age-related memory deficit in transgenic mice by human choline acetyltransferase  ap. 174-178.  aCholine acetyltransferase (ChAT, acetylCoA:choline O-acetyltransferase, EC 2.3.1.6) is the biosynthetic enzyme of neurotransmitter acetylcholine. Here we showed for the first time that transgenic mice with human ChAT kept excellent learning and memory ability during aging process. Transgenic mice were prepared through microinjection of human ChAT into mouse fertilized eggs, and PCR reaction was used to screen out the transgenic mice. The results of measurements of ChAT activity and acetylcholine level in mouse brain indicated that human ChAT gene was expressed throughout the life of the transgenic mice. The results of step-through test and water maze test suggested that learning and memory ability was improved in transgenic mice compared to that of their age-matched littermates. The results support our idea that supplement of ChAT might serve as a potential therapeutic strategy for cognitive deficit.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetylcholine 3abrain 3acholine acetyltransferase 3acognition 3aeggs 3agenes 3agenetically modified organisms 3ahumans 3amemory 3amice 3apolymerase chain reaction 2aAgingxmetabolism 2aAnimals 2aAvoidance Learning 2aBrainxenzymologyxgrowth & development. 2aCholine O-Acetyltransferasexbiosynthesisxgenetics. 2aHumans 2aMaze Learning 2aMemory 2aMemory Disordersxenzymologyxprevention & control. 2aMice 2aMice, Transgenic 2aNerve Tissue Proteinsxbiosynthesisxgenetics. 2aNeuronsxenzymology1 aFu, Ailing0 tEuropean journal of pharmacology.g2012 May 15, v. 683, no. 1-3 p.174-178dElsevier B.V.x0014-29997nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ejphar.2012.03.0093Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02876naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245012300166300001800289520125300307592002801560650001701588650002301605650001901628650001901647650003101666650002401697650002301721650001101744650001401755650005201769650001301821650001501834650001901849650002601868650003801894653004301932653001101975653003301986653001802019700001802037700001702055700001802072700002102090700001502111700001802126773012302144856008202267852000902349655001202358IND60533042820221121053824.0160728e20140808xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053304282DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbrc.2014.07.0452doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKim, Yong-il,10aOverexpression of TGF-β1 enhances chondrogenic differentiation and proliferation of human synovium-derived stem cells  ap. 1593-1599.  aTransforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) superfamily proteins play a critical role in proliferation, differentiation, and other functions of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). During chondrogenic differentiation of MSCs, TGF-β up-regulates chondrogenic gene expression by enhancing the expression of the transcription factor SRY (sex-determining region Y)-box9 (Sox9). In this study, we investigated the effect of continuous TGF-β1 overexpression in human synovium-derived MSCs (hSD-MSCs) on immunophenotype, differentiation potential, and proliferation rate. hSD-MSCs were transduced with recombinant retroviruses (rRV) encoding TGF-β1. The results revealed that continuous overexpression of TGF-β1 did not affect their phenotype as evidenced by flow cytometry and reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR). In addition, continuous TGF-β1 overexpression strongly enhanced cell proliferation of hSD-MSCs compared to the control groups. Also, induction of chondrogenesis was more effective in rRV-TGFB-transduced hSD-MSCs as shown by RT-PCR for chondrogenic markers, toluidine blue staining and glycosaminoglycan (GAG)/DNA ratio. Our data suggest that overexpression of TGF-β1 positively enhances the proliferation and chondrogenic potential of hSD-MSCs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRetroviridae 3acell proliferation 3achondrogenesis 3aflow cytometry 3agene expression regulation 3agene overexpression 3aglycosaminoglycans 3ahumans 3aphenotype 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3astaining 3astem cells 3atoluidine blue 3atranscription factors 3atransforming growth factor beta 1 0aSynovium-derived mesenchymal stem cell 0aTGF-β 0aChondrogenic differentiation 0aProliferation1 aRyu, Jae-Sung1 aYeo, Jee Eun1 aChoi, Yun Jin1 aKim, Yŏng-sang,1 aKo, Kinarm1 aKoh, Yong-Gon0 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2014 Aug. 08, v. 450 p.1593-1599dElsevier Inc.x0006-291X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2014.07.0453Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02268naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245006300171300001800234520138200252592002801634650001901662650002601681650001801707650002401725700002501749773012101774856008601895852000901981655001201990IND60624938120221118210852.0191017e20180601xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062493812DNAL7 a10.1093/bioinformatics/bty0352doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKreutz, Clemens13aAn easy and efficient approach for testing identifiability  ap. 1913-1921.  aThe feasibility of uniquely estimating parameters of dynamical systems from observations is a widely discussed aspect of mathematical modelling. Several approaches have been published for analyzing this so-called identifiability of model parameters. However, they are typically computationally demanding, difficult to perform and/or not applicable in many application settings. Here, an approach is presented which enables quickly testing of parameter identifiability. Numerical optimization with a penalty in radial direction enforcing displacement of the parameters is used to check whether estimated parameters are unique, or whether the parameters can be altered without loss of agreement with the data indicating non-identifiability. This Identifiability-Test by Radial Penalization (ITRP) can be employed for every model where optimization-based parameter estimation like least-squares or maximum likelihood is feasible and is therefore applicable for all typical systems biology models. The approach is illustrated and tested using 11 ordinary differential equation (ODE) models. The presented approach can be implemented without great efforts in any modelling framework. It is available within the free Matlab-based modelling toolbox Data2Dynamics. Source code is available at https://github.com/Data2Dynamics.

They are currently used as over-the-counter sleep aids. However, the mechanisms underlying drowsiness induced by these H₁ histamine receptor antagonists remain obscure because they produce heterogeneous receptor-independent actions. Ketotifen is a second generation H₁ histamine receptor antagonist which is more permeable to the brain than newer H₁ histamine receptor antagonists. Therefore, to access sleep-inducing profiles by H₁ histamine receptor blocking actions, the present study compared the dose-dependent effects of diphenhydramine and ketotifen (1–40mg/kg, intraperitoneal injection at dark onset time) on daily sleep–wake patterns in rats. Ketotifen dose-dependently decreased rapid-eye-movement (REM) sleep and increased non-REM sleep by amplifying slow-wave electroencephalogram powers. Diphenhydramine at 4mg/kg transiently increased non-REM sleep and reduced REM sleep similar to the effects of ketotifen. The larger injections of diphenhydramine (10–40mg/kg), however, reduced non-REM sleep, abolished slow-wave enhancements and facilitated wakefulness. The bi-directional action of diphenhydramine on sleep is similar to our former results using d-CPA. Taken together, the arousal effects caused by over-dose administrations of the first generation H₁ histamine receptor antagonists may be mediated by H₁ histamine receptor-independent actions. To further examine the tolerance of ketotifen-induced sleep, 3mg/kg ketotifen was injected daily for 5days 3h before light onset time. These experiments consistently enhanced non-REM-sleep at the end of the active phase of rats, suggesting that ketotifen may function as a desirable sleep aid although the coincidental REM sleep reduction requires attention.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantagonists 3abrain 3aelectroencephalography 3ahistamine 3ahumans 3aintraperitoneal injection 3apharmacology 3arats 3asleep 2aAnimals 2aCentral Nervous System Stimulantsxadministration & dosagexadverse effectsxpharmacology. 2aCircadian Rhythm 2aDiphenhydraminexpharmacology 2aDose-Response Relationship, Drug 2aDrug Tolerance 2aElectroencephalographyxdrug effects 2aHistamine H1 Antagonistsxadministration & dosagexadverse effectsxpharmacology. 2aHypnotics and Sedativesxadministration & dosagexadverse effectsxpharmacology. 2aInjections, Intraperitoneal 2aKetotifenxpharmacology 2aMale 2aNonprescription Drugsxadministration & dosagexadverse effectsxpharmacology. 2aRats 2aRats, Sprague-Dawley 2aSleepxdrug effects 2aSleep Stagesxdrug effects 2aSleep, REMxdrug effects 2aWakefulnessxdrug effects1 aOzaki, Tomoya1 aMohammad, Shahid1 aTsuno, Saki1 aIkeda-Sagara, Masami1 aHonda, Kazuki1 aIkeda, Masayuki0 tEuropean journal of pharmacology.g2012 May 15, v. 683, no. 1-3 p.179-185dElsevier B.V.x0014-29997nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ejphar.2012.03.0173Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02238naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002100140245007300161300001800234520123400252592002801486650001701514650002601531650002101557650002201578650002701600650001301627700001601640700001701656700001801673773013801691856007401829852000901903655001201912IND60618526920221119160232.0181030e20180501xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061852692DNAL7 a10.1039/c7ta10570c2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKwon, Hyukjin J.12aA multiscale-pore ion exchange membrane for better energy efficiency  ap. 7714-7723.  aIon exchange membranes (IEMs) have been adopted in various environmental, chemical, and energy applications. However, the formation of ion-depletion regions, caused by concentration polarization near IEMs, often leads to significant energy and efficiency loss. While much research has been devoted to solving this challenge, complete removal of ion-depletion regions is still difficult, especially when the membrane systems are operating under near- or over-limiting conditions. This paper proposes a novel multiscale-pore (MP) IEM to reduce the effect of the ion-depletion region, by allowing a fluid flow through the MP-IEM, thereby limiting the size (and the resulting resistance) of the ion-depletion region. The electrical resistance and energy consumption in MP and conventional IEM-embedded electrochemical systems were investigated, and their performance during water desalination processes were compared. The current–voltage response suggests a secondary ohmic regime attributed to an internal flow rate through the MP-IEM. Moreover, the electrochemical desalination of seawater with MP-IEMs demonstrated up to 75% reduction of energy consumption, compared with conventional IEMs under comparable operating conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3adesalination 3aelectrical resistance 3aelectrochemistry 3aenergy efficiency 3aion-exchange membranes 3aseawater1 aKim, Bumjoo1 aLim, Geunbae1 aHan, Jongyoon0 tJournal of materials chemistry.g2018 May 1, v. 6, no. 17 p.7714-7723dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26903x2050-74967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c7ta10570c3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02355naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245010900158300001800267520119800285592002801483650003501511650001701546650001301563650001901576650002001595650001801615650001701633650001301650650000901663650001501672650001001687650002901697700001501726700001701741773012801758856007401886852000901960655001201969IND60657911520221117221952.0190816e20151022xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065791152DNAL7 a10.1039/c5ay02426a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchwan, A.

However, the ongoing metabolism studies rely on robust and sensitive methods. Therefore, a method for the determination of chlorine species in blood was developed. After their ion chromatographic separation, chlorate and chlorite were detected by single-quadrupole inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (IC-ICPMS). The suitability of the method was evaluated with spiking experiments. Estimated detection limits of ∼0.1 mg Cl L⁻¹ for chlorite and ∼0.2 mg Cl L⁻¹ for chlorate in measurement solutions (injection volume 20 μL) and ∼0.5 mg Cl L⁻¹ for chlorite and ∼1.0 mg Cl L⁻¹ for chlorate in blood were obtained. In order to overcome the interfering ¹⁸O¹⁶O¹H⁺ and ³⁶Ar¹H⁺ ions, IC was also coupled to a triple-quadruple ICPMS (ICPQQQMS) operating in MS/MS mode with hydrogen as reaction gas. However, the signal-to-background ratios and, hence, the detection limits could not be improved due to a constant chlorine background.

We show the graph selection consistency of this method in the sense that the posterior probability of the true model converges to one. When there are multiple groups of data available, instead of estimating the networks independently for each group, joint estimation of the networks may utilize the shared information among groups and lead to improved estimation for each individual network. Our method is extended to jointly estimate GGMs in multiple groups of data with complex structures, including spatial data, temporal data, and data with both spatial and temporal structures. Markov random field (MRF) models are used to efficiently incorporate the complex data structures. We develop and implement an efficient algorithm for statistical inference that enables parallel computing. Simulation studies suggest that our approach achieves better accuracy in network estimation compared with methods not incorporating spatial and temporal dependencies when there are shared structures among the networks, and that it performs comparably well otherwise. Finally, we illustrate our method using the human brain gene expression microarray dataset, where the expression levels of genes are measured in different brain regions across multiple time periods.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aalgorithms 3abiometry 3abrain 3adata collection 3agene expression 3agenes 3ahumans 3amicroarray technology 3amodels 3aprobability 3aspatial data1 aWang, Tao1 aYang, Can1 aZhao, Hongyu0 tBiometrics.g2017 Sept., v. 73, no. 3 p.769-779dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltdx0006-341X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/biom.126503Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle
