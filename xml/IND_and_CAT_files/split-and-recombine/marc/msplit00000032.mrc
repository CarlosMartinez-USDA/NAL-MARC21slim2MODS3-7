Morphological and molecular analyzes of different parasite stages (eggs, adults) revealed new species of Trichobilharzia genus – Trichobilharzia anseri sp. nov. Studies on host–parasite relationship under natural conditions, showed that the life-cycle includes the snail Radix balthica (syn. R. peregra) as intermediate host. The cercariae, already isolated in Iceland from two ponds of the Reykjavik capital area – the Family park and Tjörnin Lake – are the same as those isolated in 1999 by Kolářová et al. during the first study on Icelandic parasitic agents of cercarial dermatitis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAnser anser 3aSchistosoma 3aTrichobilharzia 3aadults 3ablood vessels 3acercariae 3adermatitis 3aeggs 3ageese 3ahost-parasite relationships 3aintermediate hosts 3alakes 3alarge intestine 3aliver 3anew species 3anose 3aparasites 3aponds 3asnails 3aFrance 3aIceland 0aTrichobilharzia 0aRadix balthica 0aMorphology 0aMolecular biology 0aAnser anser 0aFlyway1 aKolářová, L.1 aPatrelle, C.1 aFerté, H.1 aSkírnisson, K.0 tInfection, genetics, and evolution.g2015 Aug., v. 34 p.298-306dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12450x1567-13487nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.meegid.2015.06.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03143naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245012500170300001600295520131900311592002801630650002101658650001501679650001201694650001601706650003101722650001501753650000901768650003101777650001901808650002001827650001501847650001301862650002401875650001701899650002101916650001101937650001101948653001701959653002301976653002401999653001902023653001802042700001902060700002302079700006402102700002802166700002002194700001202214700001702226700005702243700006002300773009902360856008502459852000902544655001202553IND60685228920221118102216.0201202e20200315xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068522892DNAL7 a10.1016/j.wasman.2020.02.0422doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWaribam, Preeti10aWaste biomass valorization through production of xylose-based porous carbon microspheres for supercapacitor applications  ap. 492-500.  aSequential potassium hydroxide (KOH)-phosphoric acid (H3PO4) activation was applied to biomass waste to fabricate activated carbon microspheres (mCMs) with a controllable porous structure. Carbon microspheres (CMs) were first synthesized from xylose using a bottom-up approach of hydrothermal carbonization. Sequential KOH and H₃PO₄ activation was applied to the CMs in a KOH-carbon solid reaction. This created pores, which were further enlarged by adsorption of H₃PO₄. The KOH:carbon (C) and H₃PO₄:C molar ratios, and the H₃PO₄ heating rate and activation time, were varied to investigate the effect on average pore size and pore distribution. A uniform porous structure was formed without destruction of the spherical shape, and an almost 700-fold increase in surface area was obtained over the non-activated CMs. Following activation with H₃PO₄, phosphorous groups were found to be present at the surface of the carbon microspheres. The mCM was tested as a supercapacitor electrode and was shown to have a maximum specific capacitance of up to 277F g⁻¹. A Ragone plot showed the maximum power density to be 173.88 W Kg⁻¹. This increased specific capacitance was attributed to the increase in surface area and the presence of phosphorous-containing acid sites on the material surface.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactivated carbon 3aadsorption 3abiomass 3acapacitance 3aelectrochemical capacitors 3aelectrodes 3aheat 3ahydrothermal carbonization 3amicroparticles 3aphosphoric acid 3aphosphorus 3aporosity 3apotassium hydroxide 3asurface area 3awaste management 3awastes 3axylose 0aHydrothermal 0aCarbon microsphere 0aChemical activation 0aSupercapacitor 0aPorous carbon1 aNgo, Sang Dinh1 aTran, Thi Tuong Vi1 aKongparakul, Suwadee1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2005-32441 aReubroycharoen, Prasert1 aChanlek, Narong1 aWei, Lu1 aZhang, Haibo1 aGuan, Guoqing1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5875-35961 aSamart, Chanatip1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2849-47220 tWaste management.g2020 Mar. 15, v. 105 p.492-500dElsevier LtdwJournal:6325x0956-053X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2020.02.0423Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02259naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001200149245010100161300001400262520106500276592002801341650002501369650001501394650001101409650001401420650001401434650001201448650002901460650001801489653002801507653002501535653002701560653001201587700001501599700001401614700001701628773012301645856008401768852000901852655001201861IND60567711520221119072633.0190411e201709  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056771152DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ympev.2017.03.0272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGu, Xun10aBrownian model of transcriptome evolution and phylogenetic network visualization between tissues  ap. 34-39.  aWhile phylogenetic analysis of transcriptomes of the same tissue is usually congruent with the species tree, the controversy emerges when multiple tissues are included, that is, whether species from the same tissue are clustered together, or different tissues from the same species are clustered together. Recent studies have suggested that phylogenetic network approach may shed some lights on our understanding of multi-tissue transcriptome evolution; yet the underlying evolutionary mechanism remains unclear. In this paper we develop a Brownian-based model of transcriptome evolution under the phylogenetic network that can statistically distinguish between the patterns of species-clustering and tissue-clustering. Our model can be used as a null hypothesis (neutral transcriptome evolution) for testing any correlation in tissue evolution, can be applied to cancer transcriptome evolution to study whether two tumors of an individual appeared independently or via metastasis, and can be useful to detect convergent evolution at the transcriptional level.  aPublisher supplied data 3aconvergent evolution 3ametastasis 3amodels 3aneoplasms 3aphylogeny 3atissues 3atranscription (genetics) 3atranscriptome 0aTranscriptome evolution 0aPhylogenetic network 0aMulti-tissue evolution 0aRNA-seq1 aRuan, Hang1 aSu, Zhixi1 aZou, Yangyun0 tMolecular phylogenetics and evolution.g2017 Sept., v. 114 p.34-39dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl3945168x1055-79037nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ympev.2017.03.0273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02393naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001200150245014200162300001800304520126100322592002801583650002401611650001301635650002101648650000701669650001301676650002601689700001901715700002401734700002501758700003401783700002601817773010501843856008601948852000902034655001202043IND60578237220180718000000.0170812e20161011xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057823722DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.macromol.6b016202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFan, Bo10aPhotocontrolled Degradation of Stimuli-Responsive Poly(ethyl glyoxylate): Differentiating Features and Traceless Ambient Depolymerization  ap. 7196-7203.  aThe depolymerization of coatings prepared from a 6-nitroveratryl carbonate end-capped poly(ethyl glyoxylate) (PEtG) self-immolative polymer was studied. This polymer undergoes end-to-end depolymerization following cleavage of the end-cap by UV light. Several important fundamental differences between this class of polymers and conventional degradable polymers were revealed. For example, polymer backbone cleavage and depolymerization exhibited different dependencies on pH, emphasizing the decoupling of these processes. Probing of the coating erosion mechanism illustrated an interesting combination of features from surface erosion and bulk degradation mechanisms that arise from the end-to-end depolymerization mechanism and further differentiate these polymers from convention degradable polymers. It was also demonstrated that, unlike backbone cleavage, PEtG depolymerization did not exhibit a dependence on water and that PEtG could depolymerize back to the volatile monomer ethyl glyoxylate at ambient temperature and pressure. This unusual feature was utilized to perform facile polymer reprogramming/recycling via an irradiation–trapping–repolymerization sequence as well as polymer patterning by a simple irradiation–evaporation sequence.  aPublisher supplied data 3aambient temperature 3acoatings 3adepolymerization 3apH 3apolymers 3aultraviolet radiation1 aTrant, John F.1 aYardley, Rebecca

This subject is highly regarded in microgrids. Integrating different energy sources under the concept of energy hub can improve the system performance as well as its reliability. The present paper is focused on the concept of hydrogen-based micro energy hub (SMEH) with regard to the integrated demand response (IDR) and hydrogen storage system (HSS). The SMEH studied in the present paper consists of different energy sources including the CHP, boiler, wind turbines, electrical energy storage system (ESS), gas storage system (GSS), thermal storage system (TSS), and hydrogen storage system (HSS). Demand response (DR) is introduced for controlling the consumers' heat demand and electrical pattern. Furthermore, the HSS not only can convert the power from renewable energy sources (RESs) into hydrogen (P2H) in the low power price periods, but also can, in turn, supply the hydrogen industry (H2P). The proposed model aims to minimize the energy cost of the whole hydrogen-based system considering the uncertainty of the power price. This optimization is performed by the harmony search (HS) optimization algorithm, which has been improved and developed by means of the local search algorithm. Eventually, the simulation and numerical results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed model.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3aelectric power 3aenergy 3aenergy costs 3aheat 3ahydrogen 3aindustry 3amodels 3aprices 3auncertainty 3awind 0aDemand response 0aEnergy hub 0aHarmony search algorithm 0aHydrogen storage system1 aChen, Yuanyuan1 aLiu, Kuili1 aDehan, Sim0 tEnergy.g2022 July 15, v. 251 p.123623-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12436x0360-54427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2022.1236233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04392naa a2200973 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002400151245011100175300001600286520197200302592002802274650003402302650001702336650002502353650001702378650002802395650001302423650001602436650002102452650002102473650001702494650002302511650001702534650001402551650002002565650001402585650001402599650001602613650001002629653000902639653002002648653001202668653002702680653001902707653001902726653002102745653000702766653001302773653000802786653000802794653000702802653000802809653000902817653000902826653000902835653000702844653000802851653000902859653000802868653000702876653000802883653001602891653000702907653000802914653000802922653000802930653000802938653000802946653000802954653000702962653000902969653000902978653000802987653000802995653000703003653000803010653000803018653000803026653001103034653000903045653000703054700002403061700002203085700003403107700005903141773011103200856008603311852000903397655001203406IND60634112320221120181913.0190516e201907  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063411232DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodres.2019.03.0332doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMajkić, Tatjana M.10aActivity profiling of Serbian and some other European Merlot wines in inflammation and oxidation processes  ap. 151-160.  aMerlot are worldwide recognized red wines. Several studies show that red wines have health benefits, mainly due to their phenolic constituents. This study evaluates twelve Serbian and other five European (French, Italian, Macedonian, Slovenian, Spanish) Merlot wines in respect of their phenolic composition and biological activity. The latter was evaluated through a set of in vitro experiments related to common benefits of moderate red wine consumption in the prevention of cardiovascular diseases. Among the examined phenolics, the most abundant acid in all samples was the gallic acid (14.3–58.3 mg/L), catechin (9.1–49.3 mg/L) was the dominant flavonoid, malvidin-3-O-glucoside (2.63–66.5 mg/L) leading anthocyanin, whereas resveratrol was found in a usual concentration (0.18–4.67 mg/L). Differences determined in phenolic profiles, mainly in content of quercetin, rutin and p-coumaric acid, leaded to separation of Serbian from foreing Merlot wines. Results of standard antioxidant assays (DPPH•, ABTS•+ and •NO scavenger capacity reducing power (FRAP), lipid peroxidation) revealed French Merlot as the most potent, but also pointed out some Serbian samples. The correlation between the content of dominant phenolics and antioxidant activity was sporadic, but samples with the highest overall phenolic content, generally had higher antioxidant potential. Concentration of wines and number of cells in ant-inflammatory assay were chosen to mimic in vivo conditions. So, the potency of examined wines to decrease the production of macrophage-derived PGE2 and TXA2 (up to 65.5 and 47.9%, respectively), could be considered as in vitro evidence of positve health effect. Regarding the phenolic content and anti-inflammatory contribution of the most abundant compounds, no correlation was witnessed. In general, this study showed interesting potential of Serbian Merlot wines, comparable to health-promoting effects of renewed Eurepean ones.  aPublisher supplied data 3a2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl 3aanthocyanins 3aantioxidant activity 3aantioxidants 3acardiovascular diseases 3acatechin 3agallic acid 3ahealth promotion 3ain vitro studies 3ainflammation 3alipid peroxidation 3anitric oxide 3aoxidation 3ap-coumaric acid 3aquercetin 3ared wines 3aresveratrol 3arutin 0aWine 0aHealth benefits 0aPhenols 0aAntioxidative activity 0aCyclooxygenase 0aThromboxane A2 0aProstaglandin E2 0aAA 0aABTS•+ 0aBHA 0aBHT 0aCE 0aCOX 0aDMSO 0aDPPH 0ad.r. 0aFC 0aFBS 0aFRAP 0aGAE 0aLP 0aLPS 0aM-1 to M-12 0aME 0aMFR 0aMIT 0aMMA 0aMSL 0aMSP 0aPCA 0aPG 0aPGB2 0aPGE2 0aPMA 0aTAC 0aTE 0aTFC 0aTPC 0aTTC 0aTrolox 0aTXA2 0aQE1 aTorović, Ljilja D.1 aLesjak, Marija M.1 aČetojević-Simin, Dragana D.1 aBeara, Ivana N.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7587-957X0 tFood research international.g2019 July, v. 121 p.151-160dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl48420x0963-99697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodres.2019.03.0333Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03118naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245011800165520161400283592002801897650002101925650001301946650001901959650001501978650000901993650001402002650001802016650001702034650002402051650002402075650001102099650001302110650001302123650001702136650001902153653001902172653002202191653002102213653001902234653001702253653003302270700001802303700001802321700002102339700001802360700001902378773011102397856008302508852000902591655001202600IND60685229120221120165935.0200427e20200515xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068522912DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bios.2020.1121102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLee, Ga-Yeon10aApplication of a thermophoretic immunoassay in the diagnosis of lupus using outer membrane particles from E. coli  aThermophoresis is the physical diffusion of molecules from hot to cold induced by a thermal gradient. Thermophoresis has been used to evaluate the interaction of biomolecules in solution. In this study, the outer membrane from E. coli was isolated and used to produce OM particles with a diameter of approximately 100 nm. These prepared OM particles were applied in a thermophoretic immunoassay. First, outer membrane (OM) particles with lipopolysaccharides (LPS) and anti-LPS antibodies were used as a model to demonstrate proof of concept and the difference in E. coli thermophoresis was explained by the changes in the molecular surface area (A) and effective charge (σₑff). The hydrodynamic size of the molecules was measured as a changing parameter, molecular surface area (A), by dynamic laser scattering (DLS), and the zeta potential was measured as a changing parameter of effective charge (σₑff) and then evaluated by the Soret equation. Using the hydrodynamic size and zeta potential values, the interaction between the antigen (OM particle with LPS) and antibody (anti-LPS antibodies) could be monitored and the results were fitted to the thermophoretic immunoassay using the Soret coefficient and equation. Finally, this OM-based immunoassay was applied to the medical diagnosis of systemic lupus erythematosus. Here, OM particles with Ro and La proteins were used to analyze the autoantibodies in patient and control sera. Thermophoretic immunoassay results were also compared to the fitted analysis using hydrodynamic size and zeta potential values and the Soret coefficient and equation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3aantigens 3aautoantibodies 3abiosensors 3acold 3aequations 3ahydrodynamics 3aimmunoassays 3alipopolysaccharides 3alupus erythematosus 3amodels 3apatients 3aproteins 3asurface area 3azeta potential 0aThermophoresis 0aSoret coefficient 0aLaser scattering 0aZeta potential 0aAuto-display 0aSystemic lupus erythematosus1 aBong, Ji-Hong1 aJung, Jaeyong1 aKang, Min-jŏng,1 aJose, Joachim1 aPyun, Jae-Chul0 tBiosensors & bioelectronics.g2020 May 15, v. 156 p.112110-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11631x0956-56637nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bios.2020.1121103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02905naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001500152245015200167300001400319520180400333592002802137650001402165650001002179650001102189650001102200650001102211650002302222650002002245650001202265651001002277700002002287700001602307700001702323700001102340773008502351856008602436852000902522655001202531IND60084281320221119182400.0141101e20120415xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008428132DNAL7 a10.1016/j.geomorph.2011.06.0422doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Jing10aBedform characteristics during falling flood stage and morphodynamic interpretation of the middle–lower Changjiang (Yangtze) River channel, China  ap. 18-26.  aA survey was conducted to examine river bedforms using side-scan sonar, sub-bottom profiler and an Acoustic Doppler Profiler in the middle–lower (mid-lower) Changjiang (Yangtze) River (downstream of Wuhan), China, during August 14–20, 2003 when the discharge was 27,000–36,000m³s⁻¹. The results show bedforms of a range of sizes occur in the channel and their heights and lengths follow an exponential correlation below Flemming's maximum line. Not all bedforms were formed under the flow conditions experienced during the survey, as shown by comparison to three existing models in the literature. Small-scale bedforms with a length <60m, defined as flat bed, mega-ripple and small dune in the present study, are mostly in equilibrium and are probably formed under the existing flow conditions. The large dunes with a length of >60m are not in equilibrium and are believed to be the relicts of previous large discharges now undergoing adjustment. Different bedform types occur in the five river reaches in this section of the Changjiang (Wuhan–Tianjiazhen, Tianjiazhen–Anqing, Anqing–Maanshan, Maanshan–Jiangyin and Jiangyin–estuary downstream). In the narrow and single channel reaches above Anqing, large/small dunes are limited to the channel with higher water surface slope where stream power is strong enough for riverbed sediments to be moved frequently. In the downstream reaches between Anqing and Jiangyin, characterized by anabranching channels, small-scale bedforms superimposed on large dunes occur widely due to intensive riverbed sediment transport from frequent diverging/converging flow during both floods and low-flow periods. Mega-ripples and flat beds prevail in the lowermost channel below Jiangyin where wider cross-sections result in dispersed stream power.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacoustics 3adunes 3afloods 3amodels 3arivers 3asediment transport 3astream channels 3asurveys 3aChina1 aWang, Zhengbing1 aLi, Maotian1 aWei, Taoyuan1 aAyuan,0 tGeomorphology.g2012 Apr. 15, v. 147-148 p.18-26dElsevier B.V.x0169-555X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.geomorph.2011.06.0423Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01890naa a2200253 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001800153245007000171300001500241520106200256592002801318650001001346650001901356650001501375700002301390773011501413856008701528852000901615655001201624IND60084720320221120105436.0141101e201308  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008472032DNAL7 a10.1016/j.isprsjprs.2013.05.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVallet, Bruno10aPartial iterates for symmetrizing non-parametric color correction  ap. 93-101.  aMosaic generation is a central tool in various fields ranging way beyond the scope of photogrammetry and requires the radiometry and color of the images to be corrected. Correction can either be done by a global parametric approach (looking for an optimal gain or gamma for each image of the mosaic), or by iteratively correcting image pairs with a non-parametric approach. Such non-parametric approaches allow for much finer correction but are asymmetric, i.e. they require the choice of a source image that will be corrected to match a target image. Thus the result on the whole mosaic will be very dependant on the order in which images are corrected. In this paper, we propose to use partial iterates to symmetrize non-parametric correction in order to solve this problem. Partial iterates formalize what partially applying a bijective function means and we explain how this can be done in both the continuous and discrete domain. This mechanism is applied to a simple non-parametric approach (histogram transfer of the luminance) to show its potential.  aPublisher supplied data 3acolor 3aphotogrammetry 3aradiometry1 aLelégard, Lâmân0 tISPRS journal of photogrammetry and remote sensing.g2013 Aug., v. 82 p.93-101dElsevier B.V.x0924-27167nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.isprsjprs.2013.05.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03272naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002500146245012400171520199800295592002802293650002302321650001302344650001802357650001502375650001402390650002602404650001902430650001302449650002002462650001902482650002702501650001202528650001002540650001102550700002902561700003202590700003002622773012102652856008002773852000902853655001202862IND60742417720221119232435.0210624e20210531xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074241772DNAL7 a10.3390/agronomy110611252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCarpio, María José10aAccelerated Dissipation of Two Herbicides after Repeated Application in Field Experiments with Organically-Amended Soil  aOrganic wastes applied as composted amendments may improve the quality of degraded soils and modify the fate of pesticides. This work has set out to study the dissipation kinetics of the herbicides chlorotoluron and flufenacet during their second-year application in field experimental plots with a sandy-loam agricultural soil without amendment (S) and amended with spent mushroom substrate (S + SMS) or green compost (S + GC). The SMS and GC were applied to the soil during the previous winter’s wheat crop campaign (1 year before the second herbicide application) at rates of 140 and 85 t ha⁻¹ (dry weight basis), respectively. The experiment involved randomized complete blocks with plots of 81 m², including three replicates per soil treatment. Surface soils were sampled after herbicide application for 225 days, and herbicide residues in the soil samples were determined by HPLC-MS. The dissipation curves of both herbicides for the three soil treatments were better fitted to the first order multi-compartment (FOMC) kinetic model. The dissipation rates of the most hydrophobic herbicide, flufenacet, were slower than those for chlorotoluron in both unamended and amended soils. The half-life (DT₅₀) values ranged between 20.7 to 41.1 days for chlorotoluron, and 42.9 to 75.6 days for flufenacet, and they followed the order S > S + SMS > S + GC. The DT₅₀ values of chlorotoluron were close for S + SMS and S + GC, and the DT₅₀ of flufenacet for S was similar to that for S + SMS. These DT₅₀ values decreased up to four times with respect to those calculated after the first application indicating an accelerated dissipation of the herbicides after the second application especially in amended soil in comparison with unamended soil. The persistence of chlorotoluron and flufenacet in an agricultural soil was modified by the effect of the organic amendments, weather conditions, and possibly the repeated application of the compounds under real field conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural soils 3aagronomy 3achlorotoluron 3aflufenacet 3ahalf life 3aherbicide application 3ahydrophobicity 3akinetics 3asoil amendments 3asoil treatment 3aspent mushroom compost 3aweather 3awheat 3awinter1 aMarín-Benito, Jesús M.1 aSánchez-Martín, María J.1 aRodríguez-Cruz, M.

Bile acids are nutrient-signaling hormones that have a significant impact on gut barrier function and motility, and the gut is considered the origin of systemic inflammation. Therefore, healthy exogenous bile could be a promising gut nutrient for critical illness, so the biomedical role of bile in endotoxemia was investigated in this study.Twelve rats were injected with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and randomized into a group with sham operation) and a group with bile external drainage (n = 6 for each group); six rats with sham operation served as the control group. In addition, interleukin-6 (IL-6) knockout mice and macrophages were treated with LPS.Compared to the control animals, the group with LPS injection and sham operation had significantly increased levels of gut permeability, gut bacterial translocation, gut mucosal tumor necrosis factor α, IL-6 transcripts, and serum tumor necrosis factor α and IL-6. Compared to group with sham operation and LPS injection, bile external drainage (in LPS-challenged rats) increased gut bacterial translocation by 10 times, and this detrimental effect was associated with prolonged intestinal transit time, increased serum IL-6 concentration, and up-regulated gut mucosal IL-6 transcripts. Moreover, bile selectively inhibited LPS-stimulated macrophages in IL-6 release, which can activate gastrointestinal submucosal neurons to promote motility. Knocking out IL-6 significantly reduced gut bacterial translocation in endotoxemic mice.Bile is a promising gut nutrient that inhibits gut bacterial translocation and promotes gut motility via an IL-6-related pathway in experimental endotoxemia.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption barrier 3aanimal models 3abile 3ablood serum 3adrainage 3aendotoxemia 3agastrointestinal transit 3ainflammation 3ainterleukin-6 3aintestines 3alipopolysaccharides 3amacrophages 3anutrition 3apermeability 0aNutrient 0aGut motility 0aBacterial translocation 0aIL-61 aZhu, Shengtao1 aTønnessen, Tor Inge,1 aYang, Runkuan0 tNutrition.g2021 Apr., v. 84 p.111064-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl56132x0899-90077nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.nut.2020.1110643Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04775naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001700153245012800170300001600298500001500314520338000329592002803709650002403737650001303761650001603774650002903790650001203819650001503831650001003846650002103856650002003877650001103897650002403908650001603932650001903948650002103967653001503988700001304003700002304016700001404039700002704053700001304080773011604093856008704209852000904296655001204305IND60084720520221120095145.0141101e201308  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008472052DNAL7 a10.1016/j.isprsjprs.2013.05.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKovacs, J.M.10aApplications of ALOS PALSAR for monitoring biophysical parameters of a degraded black mangrove (Avicennia germinans) forest  ap. 102-111.  a2019-12-06  aWithin the last few decades mangrove forests worldwide have been experiencing high annual rates of loss and many of those that remain have undergone considerable degradation. To understand the condition of these forests, various optical remote sensing platforms have been used to map and monitor these wetlands, including the use of these data for biophysical parameter mapping. For many mangrove forests a reliable source of optical imagery is not possible given their location in quasi-permanent cloud cover or smoke covered regions. In such cases it is recommended that Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) be considered. The purpose of this investigation was to examine the relationships between various ALOS-PALSAR modes, acquired from eight images, and mangrove biophysical parameter data collected from a black mangrove (Avicennia germinans) dominated forest that has experienced considerable degradation. In total, structural data were collected from 61 plots representing the four common stand types found in this degraded forest of the Mexican Pacific: tall healthy mangrove (n=17), dwarf healthy mangrove (n=15), poor condition mangrove (n=13), and predominantly dead mangrove (n=16). Based on backscatter coefficients, significant negative correlation coefficients were observed between filtered single polarization ALOS PALSAR (6.25m) HH backscatter and Leaf Area Index (LAI). When the dead stands were excluded (n=45) the strength of these relationships increased. Moreover, significant negative correlation coefficients were observed with stand height, Basal Area (BA) and to a lesser degree with stem density and mean DBH. With the coarser spatial resolution dual-polarization and quad polarization data (12.5m) only a few, and weaker, correlation coefficients were calculated between the mangrove parameters and the filtered HH backscatter. However, significant negative values were once again calculated for the HH when the 16 dead mangrove stands were removed from the sample. Conversely, strong positive significant correlation coefficients were calculated between the cross-polarization HV backscatter and LAI when the dead mangrove stands were considered. Although fewer in comparison to the HH correlations, a number of VV backscatter based relationships with mangrove parameters were observed from the quad polarization mode and, to a lesser extent, with the one single VV polarization data. In addition to backscatter coefficients, stepwise multiple regression models of the mangrove biophysical parameter data were developed based on texture parameters derived from the grey level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) of the ALOS data. A similar pattern to the backscatter relationships was observed for models based on the single polarization unfiltered data, with fairly strong coefficients of determination calculated for LAI and stem height when the dead stands were excluded. In contrast, similar coefficients of determination with biophysical parameters were observed for the dual and quad polarization multiple regression models when the dead stands were both included and excluded from the analyses. An estimated mangrove LAI map of the study area, derived from a multiple regression model of the quad polarization texture parameters, showed comparable spatial patterns of degradation to a map derived from higher spatial resolution optical satellite data.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAvicennia germinans 3awetlands 3acorrelation 3asynthetic aperture radar 3atexture 3amonitoring 3asmoke 3amangrove forests 3aleaf area index 3amodels 3aregression analysis 3acloud cover 3aremote sensing 3astand basal area 0abasal area1 aLu, X.X.1 aFlores-Verdugo, F.1 aZhang, C.1 aFlores de Santiago, F.1 aJiao, X.0 tISPRS journal of photogrammetry and remote sensing.g2013 Aug., v. 82 p.102-111dElsevier B.V.x0924-27167nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.isprsjprs.2013.05.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03609naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001500152245011000167300001400277520248500291592002802776650001102804650001902815650001102834650002302845650001902868650001402887650002302901650002302924651001002947651001702957700001902974700002202993700001303015700001503028773008503043856008603128852000903214655001203223IND60084281620221119182831.0141101e20120415xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008428162DNAL7 a10.1016/j.geomorph.2011.07.0322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMa, Yuanxu10aChannel adjustments in response to the operation of large dams: The upper reach of the lower Yellow River  ap. 35-48.  aThe Yellow River in China carries an extremely large sediment load. River channel-form and lateral shifting in a dynamic, partly meandering and partly braided reach of the lower Yellow River, have been significantly influenced by construction of Sanmenxia Dam in 1960, Liujiaxia Dam in 1968, Longyangxia Dam in 1985 and Xiaolangdi Dam in 1997. Using observations from Huayuankou Station, 128km downstream of Xiaolangdi Dam, this study examines changes in the river before and after construction of the dams. The temporal changes in the mean annual flow discharge and mean annual suspended sediment concentration have been strongly influenced by operation of theses dams. Observations of sediment transport coefficient (ratio of sediment concentration to flow discharge), at-a-station hydraulic geometry and bankfull channel form observed from 1951 to 2006 have shown that, although variations in flow and sediment load correspond to different periods of dam operation, changes in channel form are not entirely synchronous with these. The channel has been subject to substantial deposition due to the flushing of sediment from Sanmenxia Dam, resulting in a marked reduction in bankfull cross-sectional area. Flows below bankfull had a greater impact on channel form than higher flows because of very high sediment load. At-a-station hydraulic geometry shows that the variation of channel cross-sectional area below bankfull in this wide and relatively shallow system largely depends on changes in width. Such at-a-station changes are significantly influenced by (1) events below bankfull and (2) overbank floods. Bankfull depth is the main component of channel adjustment in that depth adjusts synchronously with channel area. The channel adjusts its size by relatively uniform changes in depth and width since 1981. Channel morphology is not the product of single channel-forming flow frequency. It is determined by the combination of relatively low flows that play an important role in fine sediment transport and bed configuration as with relatively high flows that are effective at modifying the channel's morphology. The sediment transport coefficient is a useful index for efficiently guiding the operation of the dams in a way that would minimize channel changes downstream. Sedimentation over the nearly 60years of study period caused the lower Yellow River to aggrade progressively, the only significant exception being the two years following completion of Sanmenxia Dam.  aPublisher supplied data 3afloods 3apollution load 3arivers 3asediment transport 3asediment yield 3asediments 3asuspended sediment 3atemporal variation 3aChina 3aYellow River1 aHuang, He Qing1 aNanson, Gerald C.1 aLi, Yong1 aYao, Wenyi0 tGeomorphology.g2012 Apr. 15, v. 147-148 p.35-48dElsevier B.V.x0169-555X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.geomorph.2011.07.0323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03560naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002700152245018200179300001600361520176100377592002802138650004402166650002302210650002202233650003702255650002102292650002102313650001002334650002102344650003702365650002002402650001702422650002802439650002202467650000902489650000902498650000702507650001302514650002002527650003302547650001102580650002002591650001402611653001602625653001502641653001802656653002002674653002202694700002002716700002902736773013402765856008602899852000902985655001202994IND60552809720221123020037.0161021e20140620xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055280972DNAL7 a10.1016/j.colsurfa.2014.03.0892doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShanmugam, Ranganathan10aIron(III) oxide adsorbed multiwalled carbon nanotube modified glassy carbon electrode as a precursor for enhanced Prussian blue formation and selective hydrogen peroxide sensing  ap. 129-137.  aPrussian blue (PB), an inorganic iron-hexacyanoferrate polymer, is a potential redox system. In general, it can be prepared on any conducting substrate by electrochemical deposition technique in which a working electrode is potential cycled with millimolar quantities of a mixture FeCl3 and [Fe(CN)6]3− in an alkaline metal ion containing acid solution (pH<3). Here in we report preparation of a new hybrid PB by a template assisted preparation method, where rather to taking any mixture, the [Fe(CN)6]3− is subjected to the electrochemical potential cycling technique with a Iron(III) adsorbed multiwalled carbon nanotube modified glassy carbon electrode (GCE/MWCNT–Fe2O3), as a template, in pH 2 KCl–HCl. The PB electrode thus designated as GCE/MWCNT–Fe2O3@PB showed well-defined redox peaks at apparent standard electrode potentials, 190±5 and 850±5mV vs Ag/AgCl and synergistic effect of PB, MWCNT and Fe2O3 systems. As prepared MWCNT–Fe2O3@PB was characterized by various physico-chemical techniques such as Scanning electron microscopy, Energy dispersive X-ray analysis, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and Raman spectroscopy. Presence of trace amount of the precursor, Fe2O3 within the inner core of the hybrid PB system was evident from the characterization results. In further, it was found that one of the metallic impurities, iron in the MWCNT has influenced the PB formation. The new hybrid PB electrode exhibited 17 times higher reduction current value over the conventionally prepared GCE/PB for the H2O2 electrocatalysis. Applicability of the electrode to sensing of H2O2 in real sample such as milk, cream bleach and clinical solution was successfully demonstrated.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aRaman spectroscopy 3aX-ray diffraction 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3ableaching agents 3acarbon nanotubes 3acream 3aelectrochemistry 3aenergy-dispersive X-ray analysis 3aferric chloride 3aferric oxide 3aglassy carbon electrode 3ahydrogen peroxide 3airon 3amilk 3apH 3apolymers 3aredox potential 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asilver 3asilver chloride 3asynergism 0aNano hybrid 0aIron oxide 0aPrussian blue 0aCarbon nanotube 0aHydrogen peroxide1 aBarathi, Palani1 aKumar, Annamalai Senthil0 tColloids and Surfaces A: Physicochemical and Engineering Aspects.g2014 June 20, v. 452 p.129-137dElsevier B.V.x0927-77577nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfa.2014.03.0893Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02518naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100006300147245008000210300001600290500001100306520134500317592002801662650001701690650001901707650001101726650001801737650001501755650001201770650001601782650001201798651001101810651002801821700002401849700002301873700001701896773012801913856008202041852000902123655001202132IND60627987320221121011537.0200728e201902  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062798732DNAL7 a10.1007/s00436-018-6145-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBernhardt, Victoria1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2753-243210aMyiasis in humans—a global case report evaluation and literature analysis  ap. 389-397.  aReview  aMyiasis refers to the infestation of living humans and vertebrates with fly larvae that feed on necrotic or vital tissue of the host. Since the invasion of new fly species in Europe is currently being observed, which live obligatorily parasitically or are close relatives of such species, the aim of this study is to obtain a global overview of the distribution of myiasis-causing fly species in times of climate change and to assess the possible consequences for Western Europe. A systematic literature search was conducted using Pubmed/Medline for the years 1997 to 2017 and a total of 464 international case reports from 79 countries were evaluated. The described cases were caused by 41 different species. In 99.4% of the cases, it was a colonization by just one species, a maximum of three species were detected in a human. Casuistics from Western Europe mostly describe myiasis as a “holiday souvenir” from tropical regions. Reports of autochthonous cases are rare in comparison to other regions. With regard to rising temperatures and the invasion of new fly species, a noticeable increase in the number of cases in Western Europe is to be assumed, which could be an increasing problem in the clinical area and in care, which is why thorough monitoring for professional identification and treatment seems important in the future.  aPublisher supplied data 3acase studies 3aclimate change 3ahumans 3ainsect larvae 3amonitoring 3amyiasis 3atemperature 3atropics 3aEurope 3aWestern European region1 aFinkelmeier, Fabian1 aVerhoff, Marcel A.1 aAmendt, Jens0 tParasitology research.g2019 Feb., v. 118, no. 2 p.389-397dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl3870072x0932-01137nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00436-018-6145-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03098naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245010900166500001900275520162100294592002801915650003001943650001101973650001401984650001101998650002202009650002502031650001502056650001102071650001202082651001002094651001702104653001702121653001602138653001602154700001902170700002002189700001802209700002202227700002602249700002002275700002002295700002202315700002302337700001602360700002002376773009302396856008202489852000902571655001202580IND60717933820221122050902.0210320e202104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071793382DNAL7 a10.1016/j.nut.2020.1110652doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMenyanu, Elias10aSalt-reduction strategies may compromise salt iodization programs: Learnings from South Africa and Ghana  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aUniversal salt iodization has been adopted by many countries to address iodine deficiency. More recently, salt-reduction strategies have been widely implemented to meet global salt intake targets of <5 g/d. Compatibility of the two policies has yet to be demonstrated. This study compares urinary iodine excretion (UIE) according to 24-h urinary sodium excretion, between South Africa (SA) and Ghana; both countries have implemented universal salt iodization, but in Ghana no salt-reduction legislation has been implemented.Participants from the World Health Organization's Study on Global Ageing and Adult Health Wave 3, with survey and valid 24-h urinary data (Ghana, n = 495; SA, n = 707), comprised the sample. Median 24-h UIE was compared across salt intake categories of <5, 5–9 and >9 g/d.In Ghana, median sodium excretion indicated a salt intake of 10.7 g/d (interquartile range [IQR] = 7.6), and median UIE was 182.4 µg/L (IQR = 162.5). In SA, both values were lower: median salt = 5.6 g/d (IQR = 5.0), median UIE = 100.2 µg/L (IQR = 129.6). UIE differed significantly across salt intake categories (P < 0.001) in both countries, with positive correlations observed in both—Ghana: r = 0.1501, P < 0.0011; South Africa: r = 0.4050, P < 0.0001. Participants with salt intakes <9 g/d in SA did not meet the World Health Organization's recommended iodine intake of 150 µg/d, but this was not the case in Ghana.Monitoring and surveillance of iodine status is recommended in countries that have introduced salt-reduction strategies, in order to prevent reemergence of iodine deficiency.  aPublisher supplied data 3aWorld Health Organization 3aadults 3aexcretion 3aiodine 3aiodine deficiency 3alaws and regulations 3amonitoring 3asodium 3asurveys 3aGhana 3aSouth Africa 0aIodized salt 0aSalt intake 0aLegislation1 aCorso, Barbara1 aMinicuci, Nadia1 aRocco, Ilaria1 aZandberg, Lizelle1 aBaumgartner, Jeannine1 aRussell, Joanna1 aNaidoo, Nirmala1 aBiritwum, Richard1 aSchutte, Aletta E.1 aKowal, Paul1 aCharlton, Karen0 tNutrition.g2021 Apr., v. 84 p.111065-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl56132x0899-90077nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.nut.2020.1110653Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02353naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100006500150245012800215520123700343592002801580650001701608650001101625650002401636650001101660650001801671653002601689653001901715653001701734653000901751653002001760653001801780700002101798773009001819856008501909852000901994655001202003IND60769465520221119194002.0220517e20220601xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076946552DNAL7 a10.1016/j.energy.2022.1236322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAbdolahifar, Abolfazl1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7357-030912aA comprehensive three-dimensional study on Darrieus vertical axis wind turbine with slotted blade to reduce flow separation  aAerodynamic performance of different designs of slotted blade of a straight blade Darrieus vertical axis wind turbine and their corresponding flow structure are precisely analyzed using three-dimensional numerical simulation. The slots aim to transfer flow from the blade pressure side to its suction side and eventually improve the blade output torque by procrastination of flow separation, especially at low tip speed ratios (TSRs). Investigations on slot width and blade height reveal that the slot should be wide enough to successfully pass flow to confront higher volume of flow separation in larger blades. Having changed the outflow location of the slot from 2C/3 to C/6 from the blade leading edge, the location of C/3 is found to be the best by noticeable alleviation in flow separation and suppressing its development toward the blade leading edge. As a result, significant improvement in average torque coefficient is achieved. This means that at TSRs of 0.5, 1.0, and 1.5, average torque coefficient increases for the slotted blade by 93.4%, 66.1%, and 10.5%, respectively. In addition, a delay of up to 15.5° occurs in the azimuth angle of torque coefficient peak with respect to that of the base blade (without slot).  aPublisher supplied data 3aaerodynamics 3aenergy 3amathematical models 3atorque 3awind turbines 0aDarrieus wind turbine 0aStraight blade 0aFlow control 0aSlot 0aFlow separation 0aDynamic stall1 aKarimian, S.M.H.0 tEnergy.g2022 June 01, v. 248 p.123632-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12436x0360-54427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2022.1236323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01527naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100001800142245009600160300001400256520064700270592002800917653001400945653001300959653001400972653001200986700001700998700001901015773011601034856007801150852000901228655001201237IND60124236620221119160541.0151025e201103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012423662DNAL7 a10.4001/003.019.01032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBologna, M.A.10aRevision of the Afrotropical Mylabrine Genus Lydoceras Marseul, 1870 (Coleoptera: Meloidae)  ap. 70-87.  aThe blister beetle genus Lydoceras Marseul, 1870, tribe Mylabrini, is revised.

However, its application is mainly based on expert knowledge, which consequently highlights important scientific issues with respect to the robustness of the methods applied in GEOBIA. In this paper, we argue that GEOBIA would benefit from another technical enhancement involving knowledge representation techniques such as ontologies. Although the role of ontologies in Geographical Information Sciences (GISciences) is not a new topic, few works have discussed how ontologies, considered from the perspective of a remote sensing specialist, can contribute to advancing remote sensing science. We summarize the main applications of ontologies in GEOBIA, especially for data discovery, automatic image interpretation, data interoperability, workflow management and data publication. Finally, we discuss the major issues related to the construction of ontologies suitable for remote sensing applications and outline long-term future advances that can be expected for the remote sensing community.  aPublisher supplied data 3aexpert opinion 3aimage interpretation 3aremote sensing 3aspatial data1 aDurieux, Laurent1 aAndrés, Samuel1 aLaporte, Marie-Angélique0 tISPRS journal of photogrammetry and remote sensing.g2013 Aug., v. 82 p.125-137dElsevier B.V.x0924-27167nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.isprsjprs.2013.05.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01828naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245006700168300001600235520067300251592002800924596004500952650001200997650001201009650001001021650001501031650002101046650001601067650001601083650001401099651001601113700002401129700002301153700005901176773012801235856008201363852000901445655001201454IND60627987520221121011548.0200728e201902  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062798752DNAL7 a10.1007/s00436-018-6152-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShodipo, Mary O.10aApparent kleptoparasitism in fish—parasitic gnathiid isopods  ap. 653-655.  aGnathiid isopods are common external parasites/micropredators that feed on the blood of marine fishes. During the course of processing samples of gnathiid isopods collected from light traps in the central Philippines, we observed a gnathiid attached to and apparently feeding from the abdomen of another gnathiid. Because the abdomens of both gnathiids were enlarged, it was unclear whether one actually fed on the blood meal of the other. Introduction of unfed gnathiids with fed gnathiids revealed that one gnathiid could and did feed on the blood meal of another. This is the first observation of apparent conspecific kleptoparasitism reported for gnathiid isopods.  aPublisher supplied data  aOCE-1536794cNational Science Foundation 3aIsopoda 3aabdomen 3ablood 3ablood meal 3akleptoparasitism 3alight traps 3amarine fish 3aparasites 3aPhilippines1 aGomez, Rick Dane C.1 aWelicky, Rachel L.1 aSikkel, Paul C.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2652-74980 tParasitology research.g2019 Feb., v. 118, no. 2 p.653-655dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl3870072x0932-01137nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00436-018-6152-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02638naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100005800151245015000209300001600359520113400375592002801509650002201537650002501559650001401584650000901598650001301607650001401620650001701634650002001651650002201671650001501693650000901708650002101717650002701738650001101765650001301776650002501789653002701814653001401841653001201855653000901867653001801876700005601894773011101950856008602061852000902147655001202156IND60634112820221122031614.0190516e201907  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063411282DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodres.2019.03.0392doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYi, Sŭng-yun,1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8861-651710aNeuroprotective effects of different molecular weight peptide fractions obtained from beef by hydrolysis with commercial enzymes in SH-SY5Y cells  ap. 176-184.  aThe neuroprotective effect of peptide fractions of different molecular weights obtained from beef by commercial enzymes in SH-SY5Y cells was investigated. The <3 kDa and < 10 kDa peptide fractions were obtained by hydrolysis using inexpensive commercial enzymes (alkaline-AK and papain). The resulting peptide fractions decreased the apoptotic ratio by 20.06% to 33.25% in hydrogen peroxide treated SH-SY5Y cells. Moreover, the peptide fractions obtained by alkaline-AK and papain did not affect cytotoxicity. In addition, the <3 kDa peptide fractions obtained using alkaline-AK reduced DNA fragmentation and reactive oxygen species generation, and increased superoxide dismutase activity and catalase levels in H2O2 treated SH-SY5Y cells. Furthermore, the <3 kDa and < 10 kDa peptide fractions showed strong antioxidant activities in 2,2′-azino-bis (3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) diammonium salt, iron chelation, and reducing power tests. The present results suggest that the <3 kDa peptide fractions obtained using alkaline-AK have superior neuroprotective activity and antioxidative activities.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA fragmentation 3aantioxidant activity 3aapoptosis 3abeef 3acatalase 3achelation 3acytotoxicity 3aenzyme activity 3ahydrogen peroxide 3ahydrolysis 3airon 3amolecular weight 3aneuroprotective effect 3apapain 3apeptides 3asuperoxide dismutase 0aNeuroprotective effect 0aApoptosis 0aPeptide 0aBeef 0aSH-SY5Y cells1 aHur, Sun Jin1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9386-58520 tFood research international.g2019 July, v. 121 p.176-184dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl48420x0963-99697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodres.2019.03.0393Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02848naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002900146245011300175520173400288592002802022650001302050650001402063650001102077650002202088650001902110650002802129650001202157650001502169650001602184650002002200650002402220650001102244700002102255773012102276856008002397852000902477655001202486IND60742418120221119232523.0210624e20210521xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074241812DNAL7 a10.3390/agronomy110610302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPingthaisong, Wimonsiri 10aNonadditive Effects on Decomposition of a Mixture of Rice Straw and Groundnut Stover Applied to a Sandy Soil  aRice straw is an abundant resource, but its use as a sandy soil amendment does not increase soil organic matter (SOM) accumulation. Our study aimed to determine the altered decomposition processes that result from mixing rice straw (RS) (low N, high cellulose) with groundnut stover (GN) (high N) relative to applying these residues singly to a sandy soil to identify the mechanisms underlying decomposition of the mixed residues. A microcosm experiment using the litter bag technique showed synergistic, nonadditive effects (observed < predicted values) of residue mass remaining (31.1% < 40.3% initial) that were concomitant with chemical constituent loss, including C (cellulose, lignin) and N. The nonadditive effects of soil microbiological parameters in response to the applied residues were synergistic (observed > predicted values) for microbial biomass C (MBC) (92.1 > 58.4 mg C kg⁻¹ soil) and antagonistic (observed < predicted values) for microbial metabolic quotient (i.e., the inverse of microbial C use efficiency (CUE)) (0.03 < 0.06 mmol CO₂-C • mmol MBC⁻¹ • hr⁻¹) and N mineralization (14.8 < 16.0 mg N kg⁻¹ soil). In the early stage of decomposition (0–14 days), mixed residues increased MBC relative to the single residues, while they decreased N mineralization relative to single GN (p ≤ 0.05). These results indicate an increase in microbial substrate CUE and N use efficiency (NUE) in the mixed residues relative to the single residues. This increased efficiency provides a basis for the synthesis of microbial products that contribute to the formation of the stable SOM pool. The SOM stabilization could bring about the SOM accumulation that is lacking under the single-RS application.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagronomy 3acellulose 3alignin 3amicrobial biomass 3amineralization 3anutrient use efficiency 3apeanuts 3arice straw 3asandy soils 3asoil amendments 3asoil organic matter 3astover1 aVityakon, Patma 0 tAgronomy.g2021 May 21, v. 11, no. 6dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:12361x2073-43957nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agronomy110610303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03415naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001600153245016500169300001400334520173800348592002802086650001502114650001502129650002602144650001202170650002202182650001102204650001302215650001802228650001402246650001102260650001902271650001302290650004302303650001502346650001302361650001502374650001502389650001902404650001302423650000902436650001902445650001102464650002402475700001902499700001402518700001602532700002302548700002202571700001602593700001802609773011402627856008702741852000902828655001202837IND60084720820221120105619.0141101e201308  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008472082DNAL7 a10.1016/j.isprsjprs.2013.04.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRamoelo, A.10aNon-linear partial least square regression increases the estimation accuracy of grass nitrogen and phosphorus using in situ hyperspectral and environmental data  ap. 27-40.  aGrass nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) concentrations are direct indicators of rangeland quality and provide imperative information for sound management of wildlife and livestock. It is challenging to estimate grass N and P concentrations using remote sensing in the savanna ecosystems. These areas are diverse and heterogeneous in soil and plant moisture, soil nutrients, grazing pressures, and human activities. The objective of the study is to test the performance of non-linear partial least squares regression (PLSR) for predicting grass N and P concentrations through integrating in situ hyperspectral remote sensing and environmental variables (climatic, edaphic and topographic). Data were collected along a land use gradient in the greater Kruger National Park region. The data consisted of: (i) in situ-measured hyperspectral spectra, (ii) environmental variables and measured grass N and P concentrations. The hyperspectral variables included published starch, N and protein spectral absorption features, red edge position, narrow-band indices such as simple ratio (SR) and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). The results of the non-linear PLSR were compared to those of conventional linear PLSR. Using non-linear PLSR, integrating in situ hyperspectral and environmental variables yielded the highest grass N and P estimation accuracy (R²=0.81, root mean square error (RMSE)=0.08, and R²=0.80, RMSE=0.03, respectively) as compared to using remote sensing variables only, and conventional PLSR. The study demonstrates the importance of an integrated modeling approach for estimating grass quality which is a crucial effort towards effective management and planning of protected and communal savanna ecosystems.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3aecosystems 3aenvironmental factors 3agrasses 3agrazing intensity 3ahumans 3aland use 3aleast squares 3alivestock 3amodels 3anational parks 3anitrogen 3anormalized difference vegetation index 3aphosphorus 3aplanning 3aprediction 3arangelands 3aremote sensing 3asavannas 3asoil 3asoil nutrients 3astarch 3awildlife management1 aSkidmore, A.K.1 aCho, M.A.1 aMathieu, R.1 aHeitkönig, I.M.A.1 aDudeni-Tlhone, N.1 aSchlerf, M.1 aPrins, H.H.T.0 tISPRS journal of photogrammetry and remote sensing.g2013 Aug., v. 82 p.27-40dElsevier B.V.x0924-27167nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.isprsjprs.2013.04.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02828naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245019800163300001600361520143100377592002801808650001701836650001701853650002401870650002501894650001401919650002201933650001501955650002101970650002201991650001002013650001902023650002502042650001302067650001002080700001602090700002302106700005802129773012802187856008202315852000902397655001202406IND60627987620221121222114.0200728e201902  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062798762DNAL7 a10.1007/s00436-018-6150-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWessels, C.10aComparative mtDNA phylogeographic patterns reveal marked differences in population genetic structure between generalist and specialist ectoparasites of the African penguin (Spheniscus demersus)  ap. 667-672.  aTo address factors affecting genetic diversity and dispersal of ectoparasites, we compared mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) population genetic structures of the generalist soft tick Ornithodoros capensis to the more host-specific nest flea Parapsyllus humboldti. A total of 103 ticks and 92 fleas were sampled at five distinct South African island/mainland African penguin (Spheniscus demersus) colonies. With its wide host range, O. capensis showed no evidence of significant cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) mtDNA population differentiation among the five sampling sites (φₛₜ = 0.00 ± 0.004; p = 0.80), as well as a higher level of genetic diversity (π = 0.8% ± 0.06%) when compared to P. humboldti. In contrast, the flea showed significant population structure among most of the same sampling sites (φₛₜ = 0.22 ± 0.11; p ≤ 0.05) and a lower level of genetic diversity (π = 0.2% ± 0.01%). Our findings suggest that despite both parasites being mostly nest bound, O. capensis have few barriers to dispersal among island and mainland colonies. However, P. humboldti are more dependent on the African penguin for dispersal and thus have more impediments to gene flow among the same colonies. These findings broadly support the SGVH (specialist generalist variation hypothesis) and provide the first evidence for this hypothesis in parasites restricted to seabird colonies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOrnithodoros 3aSiphonaptera 3aSpheniscus demersus 3acytochrome-c oxidase 3agene flow 3agenetic variation 3ahost range 3ahost specificity 3amitochondrial DNA 3anests 3aphylogeography 3apopulation structure 3aseabirds 3aticks1 aMatthee, S.1 aEspinaze, M.

In this study, we characterized an Slt2-type MAPK in Ganoderma lucidum, GlSlt2, which was transcriptionally induced during the primordium and fruiting body stages. RNA interference was used to examine the function of GlSlt2. Knockdown of GlSlt2 caused defects in growth and increased hyphal branching as well as hypersensitivity to cell wall-disturbing substances. Consistently, the chitin and β-1,3-d-glucan contents and the expression of cell wall biosynthesis genes were decreased and down-regulated, respectively, in GlSlt2 knockdown strains compared with those in the wild type (WT). In addition, no primordium or fruiting body could be observed in GlSlt2 knockdown strains. Furthermore, the intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) content and ganoderic acid biosynthesis also decreased in GlSlt2 knockdown strains. Addition of H2O2 could recover the decreased ganoderic acid content in GlSlt2 knockdown strains, indicating that GlSlt2 might regulate ganoderic acid biosynthesis via the intracellular ROS level. Overall, GlSlt2 is involved in hyphal growth, fruiting body development, cell wall integrity, oxidative stress and ganoderic acid biosynthesis in G. lucidum.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGanoderma lucidum 3aRNA interference 3abiosynthesis 3acell walls 3achitin 3aeukaryotic cells 3afruiting bodies 3aganoderic acid 3agenes 3ahydrogen peroxide 3ahypersensitivity 3ahyphae 3amicrobial growth 3amitogen-activated protein kinase 3aoxidative stress 3atranscription (genetics) 0aGanoderma lucidum 0aMAPK 0aCell wall integrity 0aROS 0aSexual development 0aSecondary metabolism1 aSun, Zehua1 aRen, Ang1 aShi, Liang1 aShi, Dengke1 aLi, Xiongbiao1 aZhao, Mingwen0 tFungal genetics and biology.g2017 July, v. 104 p.6-15dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl54870x1087-18457nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fgb.2017.04.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01878naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024003800135040001800173100001700191245003900208300001600247500001900263506007600282520061900358592002800977506003701005650000801042650002401050650002001074650001101094650001201105651001701117653001001134653001301144653001201157653001001169700001701179700001801196700001601214700001801230773009001248856008501338852000901423655001201432IND60557844120221207090006.0200607e201612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055784412DNAL7 a286164872pmid7 aPMC54413592pmcid7 a10.1016/j.onehlt.2016.09.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDahlin, C.R.10aWild snakes harbor West Nile virus  ap. 136-138.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aWest Nile virus (WNV) has a complex eco-epidemiology with birds acting as reservoirs and hosts for the virus.

Food preservative ability and mutagenicity studies of GTS extract and identification of antimicrobial compounds from GTS extract were carried out. The GTS extract showed only anti-yeast activity against Candida albicans with MIC value of 938μg/mL and Zygosaccharomyces rouxii with a MIC of 469μg/mL. The active compounds were identified as theasaponin E1 (1), assamsaponin A (2), and assamsaponin B (3). And GTS extracts didn't show mutagenicity because there were no dose-dependent changes in colonies of Salmonella typhimurium TA98, TA100, TA1535, TA1537, and Escherichia coli WP2uvrA regardless of the metabolic activation system. And GTS extract also showed a potent food preservation affect which eliminated all yeast below the MIC value in application test at soy sauce. Overall, these results indicate that GTS extract could be a safe and effective food preservative with anti-yeast activity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCamellia sinensis 3aCandida albicans 3aEscherichia coli 3aSalmonella Typhimurium 3aZygosaccharomyces rouxii 3aactive ingredients 3aanti-infective agents 3aantifungal properties 3adose response 3afood preservation 3afood preservatives 3agreen tea 3amutagenicity 3aseed extracts 3asoy sauce 3ayeasts 0aGreen tea seed 0aAntiyeast 0aSaponin 0aNatural preservative 0aFood preservation1 aKim, Jin Yong,1 aJeong, Eun Tak1 aCh'oe, T'ae-ho,1 aYoon, Tae Mi0 tFood research international.g2018 Mar., v. 105 p.982-988dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl48420x0963-99697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodres.2017.11.0593Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03032naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002800146245013600174520173500310592002802045650001302073650002202086650002102108650001302129650002502142650001202167650002102179650001702200650001302217650001302230650002102243650000902264650000902273650002002282700002702302700001902329700002102348700003002369773012202399856008002521852000902601655001202610IND60742418220221119232424.0210624e20210601xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074241822DNAL7 a10.3390/agronomy110611292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBenlamlih, Fatima Zahra10aEvaluation of a New Generation of Coated Fertilizers to Reduce the Leaching of Mineral Nutrients and Greenhouse Gas (N2O) Emissions  aThe increased use of fertilizers in agriculture and forest and horticulture nurseries contributes to the pollution of water resources and greenhouse gas emissions. The objective of this study is to evaluate a new generation of fertilizers coated with new biodegradable polymers in terms of physical quality, release kinetics, and their effect on reducing nitrate leaching and N₂O emissions and compare them to uncoated fertilizers (Urea, monoammonium phosphate (MAP), and KCl) having the same mineral nutrient concentration. In a peat-based substrate, the release of mineral nutrients was similar in both types of fertilizer. Two hours after application, Urea released 34% more urea than Biodrix N, the difference disappearing after one day. The leaching of cumulative ammonium nitrogen after 20 days was reduced by 40% and 26% respectively by Aminaex and Biodrix N compared to Urea. In a peat-based substrate containing 30% (v/v) of compost, the cumulative nitrate leaching was reduced by 54% by Biodrix N and by 41% by Aminaex compared to Urea. The highest average N₂O flux was observed on the first day for Urea, whereas for Aminaex and Biodrix N, N₂O emissions increased on the third day, reaching a peak of efflux on day 10. A 10-day delay of the N₂O efflux emissions and a longer period of emissions were observed in treatments containing Aminaex and Biodrix N compared to Urea. Cumulative N₂O efflux was 142, 154, and 171 mg m⁻², respectively, for Urea, Aminaex, and Biodrix N over a 20-day period. These new biodegradable polymer-coated nitrogen fertilizers can reduce mineral nutrient leaching in the event of heavy rainfall and lower maximum N₂O emissions in comparison with conventional nitrogen sources.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagronomy 3aammonium nitrogen 3abiodegradability 3acomposts 3adiammonium phosphate 3aforests 3agreenhouse gases 3ahorticulture 3anitrates 3anitrogen 3anutrient content 3arain 3aurea 3awater pollution1 aLamhamedi, Mohammed S.1 aPepin, Steeve 1 aBenomar, Lahcen 1 aMessaddeq, Y.q(Younés),0 tAgronomy.g2021 June 01, v. 11, no. 6dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:12361x2073-43957nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agronomy110611293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02567naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245014900169520124300318592002801561650000901589650002201598650001101620650001801631650002301649650001401672653003201686653003201718653002301750653003001773653001501803700005201818700001601870700001301886700001701899700001201916700001401928700001901942773009001961856008502051852000902136655001202145IND60769465820221119194007.0220517e20220601xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076946582DNAL7 a10.1016/j.energy.2022.1236372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Yuntian10aPerformance comparison between straight channel cold plate and inclined channel cold plate for thermal management of a prismatic LiFePO4 battery  aAn efficient battery thermal management system is indispensable for ensuring the safety and stability of Li-ion batteries. In this work, for applications of a prismatic LiFePO₄ battery in electric vehicle, an inclined channel cold plate is designed based on the straight channel cold plate. The performance of the straight channel cold plate and the inclined channel cold plate are numerically investigated and compared under different coolants, channel numbers and mass flow rates. The j/f factor considering the fluid flow and heat transfer characteristics is employed to judge the comprehensive performances of cold plates. Results show that the performance of inclined channel cold plate is much better than that of straight channel cold plate. The j/f factor of the straight channel cold plate is improved by 79.64% when the coolant is water, the mass flow rate is 0.6 g s⁻¹, the channel number is 5 and the inclined angle is 15°. Furthermore, effects of inclined angle are investigated. It is found that the larger the inclined angle the better the performance of the inclined channel cold plate. This work suggests that the inclined channel cold plate is more suitable for applying in the battery thermal management system.  aPublisher supplied data 3acold 3aelectric vehicles 3aenergy 3aheat transfer 3amanagement systems 3amass flow 0aStraight channel cold plate 0aInclined channel cold plate 0aThermal management 0aPrismatic LiFePO4 battery 0aj/f factor1 aZuo, Wei1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6829-69851 aE, Jiaqiang1 aLi, Jing1 aLi, Qingqing1 aSun, Ke1 aZhou, Kun1 aZhang, Guangde0 tEnergy.g2022 June 01, v. 248 p.123637-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12436x0360-54427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2022.1236373Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02218naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001800152245015400170300001600324520087000340592002801210650002401238650001201262650001201274650002101286650000901307650001301316650001301329650002701342650001301369653001501382653002701397653000801424653004401432653002401476700002301500700002001523700002401543773013401567856008601701852000901787655001201796IND60552810020221118021305.0161021e20140620xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055281002DNAL7 a10.1016/j.colsurfa.2014.03.0922doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKundu, Arjama10aEffect of cosolvents in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate micelles on the rate of alkaline hydrolysis of tris(2,2′-bipyridine)iron(II) complex  ap. 148-153.  aThe kinetics of alkaline hydrolysis of tris(2,2′-bipyridine)iron(II) complex have been studied in the presence of various alcohols of different chain lengths and number of OH groups in aqueous and SDS micellar medium. In aqueous medium, rate increases at all percentages of 1-alkanols in the following order: PrOH>EtOH>MeOH>H2O, whereas the effectiveness of glycols as inhibitors is in the following order: Gly>EG>PG>H2O. Hence PrOH has the most pronounced effect as accelerator and Gly as inhibitor on rate. In the presence of SDS micelles, rate has been inhibited because of binding of SDS with substrate, but the presence of alcohols reduces this inhibitory effect of SDS. All these results have been explained in terms of the CMC, micellar size and properties of SDS in these cosolvents, H-bonding capacity of solvents, dielectric constants of the media, etc.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalkaline hydrolysis 3aethanol 3aglycols 3ahydrogen bonding 3airon 3amethanol 3amicelles 3asodium dodecyl sulfate 3asolvents 0aCosolvents 0aSodium dodecyl sulfate 0aCMC 0atris(2,2′-bipyridine)iron(II) complex 0aAlkaline hydrolysis1 aDasmandal, Somnath1 aMajumdar, Tapas1 aMahapatra, Ambikesh0 tColloids and Surfaces A: Physicochemical and Engineering Aspects.g2014 June 20, v. 452 p.148-153dElsevier B.V.x0927-77577nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfa.2014.03.0923Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02741naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002500147245015100172300001400323520143000337592002801767650001501795650001801810650000801828650002001836650002601856650001601882650001001898650001001908650002601918650001301944650001601957650001601973653000801989653001901997653002602016653001802042653002002060653002602080773011002106856008202216852000902298655001202307IND60567712320221119074228.0180904e201707  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056771232DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fgb.2017.04.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aClutterbuck, A. John10aGenomic CG dinucleotide deficiencies associated with transposable element hypermutation in Basidiomycetes, some lower fungi, a moss and a clubmoss  ap. 16-28.  aMany Basidiomycete genomes include substantial fractions that are deficient in CG dinucleotides, in extreme cases amounting to 70% of the genome. CG deficiency is variable and correlates with genome size and, more closely, with transposable element (TE) content. Many species have limited CG deficiency; it is therefore likely that there are other mechanisms that can control TE proliferation. Examination of TEs confirms that C-to-T transition mutations in CG dinucleotides may comprise a conspicuous proportion of differences between paired elements, however transition/transversion ratios are never as high as those due to RIP in some Ascomycetes, suggesting that repeat-associated CG mutation is not totally pervasive. This has allowed gene family expansion in Basidiomycetes, although CG transition differences are often prominent in paired gene family members, and are evidently responsible for destruction of some copies. A few lower fungal genomes exhibit similar evidence of repeat-associated CG mutation, as do the genomes of the two lower plants Physcomitrella patens and Selaginella moellendorffii, in both of which mutation parallels published methylation of CHG as well as CG nucleotides. In Basidiomycete DNA methylation has been reported to be largely confined to CG dinucleotides in repetitive DNA, but while methylation and mutation are evidently associated, it is not clear which is cause and which effect.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAscomycota 3aBasidiomycota 3aDNA 3aDNA methylation 3aPhyscomitrella patens 3aSelaginella 3afungi 3agenes 3amosses and liverworts 3amutation 3anucleotides 3atransposons 0aRIP 0aCpG deficiency 0aBasidiomycete genomes 0aHypermutation 0aDNA methylation 0aTransposable elements0 tFungal genetics and biology.g2017 July, v. 104 p.16-28dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl54870x1087-18457nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fgb.2017.04.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02626naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002200139245011000161300001800271520126700289592002801556650000801584650001501592650002301607650001901630650001501649650001101664650000901675650001101684650001501695650000901710650001101719650002301730650001401753650002101767650002101788650001601809650001401825700002201839700002101861700002501882700002501907700002401932773010401956856007502060852000902135655001202144IND60534225520170629000000.0160802e20150219xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053422552DNAL7 a10.1021/ef501392k2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLapene, Alexandre10aKinetics Oxidation of Heavy Oil. 2. Application of Genetic Algorithm for Evaluation of Kinetic Parameters  ap. 1119-1129.  aIn-situ combustion (ISC) is the process of injecting air into oil reservoirs to oxidize part of the crude oil and has been utilized for both light oil and heavy oil. The viscosity of the remaining crude oil is reduced by the significant heat generated from combustion reactions, which contributes to enhanced oil recovery. In the first paper in this series [Lapene et al., Energy Fuels 2011, 25, 4886–4895], we developed a new method to interpret ramped temperature oxidation (RTO) experiments, using a reactor model based on a compositional and full equation-of-state approach. In this work, we use this RTO reactor model, coupled with an optimization tool, to determine the optimal kinetic parameters for an extra heavy oil reservoir. Kinetic parameters are commonly determined using analytical methods and limited data. Typically, only one type of observational data (for example, oxygen consumption) is used from one experiment. Here, we use two series of experiments datanamely, CO₂ and O₂ concentrationsand a multiobjective approach to obtain kinetic parameters for the different combustion reactions. Finally, we obtain a set of possible kinetic schemes, accouting for all mechanisms, such as reactions, phase changes, and transport processes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3aalgorithms 3aanalytical methods 3acarbon dioxide 3acombustion 3aenergy 3aheat 3amodels 3aoil fields 3aoils 3aoxygen 3aoxygen consumption 3apetroleum 3aphase transition 3asuperoxide anion 3atemperature 3aviscosity1 aDebenest, Gérald1 aQuintard, Michel1 aCastanier, Louis M.,1 aGerritsen, Margot G.1 aKovscek, Anthony R.0 tEnergy & Fuels.g2015 Feb. 19, v. 29, no. 2 p.1119-1129dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-50297nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fef501392k3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03664naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245015500167300001600322520202200338592002802360650003302388650001302421650001902434650001002453650002202463650001702485650001602502650002002518650001502538650001202553650001802565650001102583650001302594650001802607650002002625650001502645650002802660650001802688650001702706650002002723651001102743653002002754653001802774653001802792653002702810653001102837700002202848700002002870773012902890856008203019852000903101655001203110IND60557844320221119201853.0180905e201608  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055784432DNAL7 a10.1016/j.gsd.2016.07.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRieger, Kerstin10aAccess to groundwater and link to the impact on quality of life: A look at the past, present and future public health needs in Mzimba District, Malawi  ap. 117-129.  aImagine a world where you have to get up at 4am to walk for two hours in the dark to fetch water. This remains true in Malawi, where it is said that the Millennium Development Goals have been met. This research aimed at understanding the impact access to groundwater has on people's ‘Being’, ‘Belonging’ and ‘Becoming,’ as well as on people's capabilities and on their quality of life in Mzimba District, Malawi. Being, Belonging and Becoming define three life domains. Being reveals ‘who one is,’ Belonging reflects ‘connections with one's environments’ and Becoming relates to ‘achieving personal goals, hopes and aspirations.’ The study comprised of 210 households, four treatment groups based on communities consisting of households with access to a hand pump and compared to four control group communities, where households had no access to a hand pump. Results showed current awareness of environmental issues is linked to recognising future (5 years in advance) environmental challenges. There is a need to create awareness of water quality within the communities and point-of-use household water treatment. Both the treatment- and control group had a gap in sanitation facilities, with up to 27 people (5–6 households) sharing a single pit latrine. Polygamous marriages had implications on self-respect and led to neglect on the first wives. Focus group discussions revealed HIV, disabilities and mental health issues, including the use of drugs and alcohol, affect freedom, and created a burden, not only for affected individuals, but also for their extended families. Focus groups highlighted safe and clean drinking water, improved sanitation facilities, better hygiene, and accessible public health services as pressing needs. The implications of this study demonstrate, rural individuals ‘Being’, ‘Belonging’ and ‘Becoming’ need to be considered when addressing pressing public health needs, as Malawi works toward the Sustainable Development Goals for water supply.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHuman immunodeficiency virus 3aalcohols 3adrinking water 3adrugs 3aextended families 3afocus groups 3agroundwater 3ahealth services 3ahouseholds 3ahygiene 3amental health 3apeople 3apolygamy 3apublic health 3aquality of life 3asanitation 3asustainable development 3awater quality 3awater supply 3awater treatment 3aMalawi 0aQuality of life 0aWater quality 0aPublic health 0aSanitation and hygiene 0aMalawi1 aHolm, Rochelle H.1 aSheridan, Helen0 tGroundwater for sustainable development.g2016 Aug.,  Sept., v. 2-3 p.117-129dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23351x2352-801X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gsd.2016.07.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03185naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245006600170300001600236520189000252592002802142650001402170650001402184650001102198650001602209650001202225650001702237650001902254650001102273650001602284650001602300650001302316650001102329650001102340650001602351653002802367653002502395653001702420653001602437653001702453700002302470700002002493773010802513856008502621852000902706655001202715IND60468970020221119154259.0151217e20160402xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6046897002DNAL7 a10.1080/09064710.2015.10875872doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aArduini, Iduna12aA growth scale for the phasic development of common buckwheat  ap. 215-228.  aGrowth scales give a standardized definition of crop development and increase the understanding among researchers and growers. In this research we defined a growth scale for the phasic development of common buckwheat that was mainly based on a sequence of easily recognizable changes occurring on the first and the terminal clusters of inflorescences formed on the main stem. Observations were carried out on plants grown in two years throughout spring. In an attempt to uniform the duration of phasic development across sowing dates, the length of phases and sub-phases was calculated in days and in thermal time using nine combinations of cardinal temperatures. A sequence of stages and various patterns of coordinated development were maintained throughout all sowings and years. Specifically, (1) the first inflorescence became visible after three true leaves had fully expanded on the main stem; (2) flowering reached the terminal inflorescence cluster before full-sized green fruits became visible in the first inflorescence, and (3) fruit ripening in the whole plant ended within two weeks of the end of ripening in the oldest inflorescence. Plant size was increased with the delay of sowing, and the length of the growth cycle was by approximately 400°Cd longer when plants experienced a day length longer than 15 h. This changed the correspondence between flowering and ripening stages, so that full flowering was associated with the development of green fruits in the first inflorescence when the cycle was short, but with their development in the terminal cluster when it was long. Trends in grain yield did not correspond to those in plant size and phase length. We are confident that this growth scale will be a valuable tool for following the progress of buckwheat development and to predict growth patterns and harvest time in response to temperature and photoperiod.  aPublisher supplied data 3abuckwheat 3aflowering 3afruits 3agrain yield 3agrowers 3aharvest date 3ainflorescences 3aleaves 3aphotoperiod 3aresearchers 3aripening 3asowing 3aspring 3atemperature 0aCoordinated development 0aFagopyrum esculentum 0agrowth stage 0asowing date 0athermal time1 aMasoni, Alessandro1 aMariotti, Marco0 tActa agriculturæ Scandinavica.g2016 Apr. 2, v. 66, no. 3 p.215-228dTaylor & Francisx1651-19137nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09064710.2015.10875873Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02063naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100002500154245005800179300001600237520096800253592002801221650001901249650001601268650001701284650002001301650002201321650001501343650001301358650001901371650002901390651001801419653002101437653002301458653001501481773009501496856008901591852000901680655001201689IND60568591920221120182901.0190319e201707  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056859192DNAL7 a10.1016/j.landusepol.2017.04.0302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWaite, Jacqueline L.10aLand reuse in support of renewable energy development  ap. 105-110.  aRenewable Portfolio Standards are U.S. state-level policies that encourage renewable energy development to meet a proportion of electricity demand. These policies, along with state and federal incentives and private sector demand, have motivated interest in renewable energy capacity, which is a function of available land. As global climate change has been driven by the combination of fossil fuel combustion and land cover change, renewable energy development is best achieved through sustainable land use practices. One option is to site renewable energy installations on land that has been contaminated or degraded. This analysis looks at the degree to which renewable energy demand created by state renewable portfolio standards in the United States could be met by contaminated or formerly contaminated sites. Results suggest that land resources are more than sufficient to meet current and possibly future RPS-generated demand in three out of four regions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclimate change 3aelectricity 3afossil fuels 3afuel combustion 3aissues and policy 3aland cover 3aland use 3aprivate sector 3arenewable energy sources 3aUnited States 0aRenewable energy 0aContaminated lands 0aLand reuse0 tLand use policy.g2017 July, v. 66 p.105-110dElsevier LtdwJournal:12412x0264-83777nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.landusepol.2017.04.0303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04011naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094024004000137040001800177100001800195245018300213506007600396506003100472520228700503592002802790596004502818506003702863650002302900650002502923650001602948650001802964650001502982650002202997650001903019650002903038650001803067650002003085650002003105650004303125650001003168651001103178653001603189653002103205653003403226653003403260700003003294773009703324856008703421852000903508655001203517IND60685230020221207143529.0200804e202009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068523002DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodcont.2020.1072062chorus7 a10.1016/j.foodcont.2020.1072062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMolnar, Gabor10aReview of mechanisms for food safety-related SPS measures within African regional Economic Communities (RECs): Paving the way for a continent-wide food safety coordination effort  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aCHORUS License Information  aAfrican policy makers are paying increasing attention to food safety as a key contributor to food security across the continent and as an opportunity to enhance the economic potential of additional trade in food and agrifood commodities within and outside Africa.By default, the regional and continental economic integration framework was envisaged by way of the African Economic Community (AEC) through its eight regional pillars in the form of Regional Economic Communities (RECs) in which the development of sanitary and phytosanitary (SPS) measures have emerged in the context of trade facilitation rather than for public health considerations. This may be in contradiction with the original prioritization of objectives outlined in the Codex Alimentarius Commission's Principles and Guidelines for National Food Control Systems (CAC/GL 82–2013). Simultaneously, national and regional food control systems are at an impasse, often afflicted with inadequate institutional capacities, ineffective regulatory systems and weak SPS coordination efforts, further hindering the achievement of continental economic development objectives. For this reason, the revision of current practices, trends and needs will facilitate the prioritization of decisive actions for SPS investments at regional and continental levels and increase the likelihood that future SPS harmonization efforts are successful, including the establishment of continental risk assessment and risk management authorities and/or reference laboratories.This desktop-review elaborates on the regional and continental SPS situation in Africa, what coordination and communication measures are in place and what investments have been made in the RECs and in the African Union. As part of the analysis, some potential obstacles contributing to slow-down of the continental SPS harmonization process will be examined. However, the article will not aim to conduct detailed mapping of existing and required SPS policy, regulatory and institutional frameworks at the regional or continental level due to the complexity of these matters. The paper will nonetheless strive to outline a set of recommendations, as a starting point, to expedite the convergence of these efforts but will not provide solutions for every challenge.  aPublisher supplied data  cUSDAdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/1000001990 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aCodex Alimentarius 3aeconomic development 3afood safety 3afood security 3aguidelines 3aissues and policy 3aprioritization 3aproducts and commodities 3apublic health 3arisk assessment 3arisk management 3asanitary and phytosanitary regulations 3atrade 3aAfrica 0aFood safety 0aSPS coordination 0aRegional food control systems 0aRegional economic integration1 aGodefroy, Samuel Benrejeb0 tFood control.g2020 Sept., v. 115 p.107206-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl56242x0956-71357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodcont.2020.1072063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03099naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001700153245016300170520163700333592002801970650002201998650002902020650001402049650001402063650002402077650002302101650001302124650001102137653002702148653005502175653001202230653002802242700001402270700001602284700001802300700001402318700001602332700001602348700001802364700005502382773011902437856008802556852000902644655001202653IND60717934520221122050859.0211227e202105  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071793452DNAL7 a10.1016/j.resconrec.2020.1052692doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDing, Zhihua10aResearch on the influence of anthropomorphic design on the consumers' express packaging recycling willingness:the moderating effect of psychological ownership  aThe change of consumers' shopping mode has caused massive express packaging waste, which results in resource waste and environmental pollution. Therefore, the recycling of express packaging has become an important environmental protection requirements as well as social issue and it requires an urgent solution. At the same time, the impact of anthropomorphism on consumer behavior is increasingly prominent. Built on the "A Three-Factor Theory of Anthropomorphism" and the "Theory of Perspective-Taking", this article established a psychological dynamic theoretical model about the effect of anthropomorphic design on consumers' recycling willingness. Through four experiments, variance analysis and regression analysis, it can be concluded that: (1) Anthropomorphic design has a significant positive impact on the consumers' express packaging recycling willingness, and empathy plays a mediating effect between them. (2) Compared with anthropomorphic language design, anthropomorphic shape design has a more significant impact on consumers' express packaging recycling willingness. (3) High psychological ownership has a significant positive moderating effect on the relationship between anthropomorphic design and empathy, i.e., the higher the consumer's psychological ownership, the stronger the mediating effect of empathy. Low psychological ownership has no significant moderating effect on the relationship between anthropomorphic design and empathy. Therefore, consumers' willingness to recycle express packaging can be promoted by improving their psychological ownership and the anthropomorphic design of express packaging.  aPublisher supplied data 3aconsumer behavior 3aenvironmental protection 3aownership 3apollution 3aregression analysis 3atheoretical models 3avariance 3awastes 0aAnthropomorphic design 0aConsumers' express packaging recycling willingness 0aEmpathy 0aPsychological ownership1 aSun, Jing1 aWang, Yawei1 aJiang, Xuehui1 aLiu, Rong1 aSun, Wenbin1 aMou, Yupeng1 aWang, Dianwen1 aLiu, Manzhi1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4533-84890 tResources, conservation, and recycling.g2021 May, v. 168 p.105269-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11928x0921-34497nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.resconrec.2020.1052693Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03541naa a2200637 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245011500170300001600285520161000301592002801911650002401939650003101963650002501994650001702019650001602036650001002052650003602062650002102098650002202119650001802141650002202159650001802181650001202199650001102211650001002222650000902232650002302241650003402264650002202298650001402320650001902334650001902353653002702372653001902399653002202418653002302440700002202463700001902485700001902504700002002523700002002543700001902563700002002582700001602602700001202618700005502630773011102685856008602796852000902882655001202891IND60591228720221119205941.0190410e201803  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059122872DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodres.2017.11.0632doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSeung, Tae Wan10aEthyl acetate fraction from Hibiscus sabdariffa L. attenuates diabetes-associated cognitive impairment in mice  ap. 589-598.  aThe ameliorating effects of the ethyl acetate fraction from Hibiscus sabdariffa L.

Therefore, EFHS containing various physiologically active materials can potentially be used for improving DM-induced cognitive impairment via its antioxidant activity, improvement of the cholinergic system, and hyperphosphorylation tau signaling.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHibiscus sabdariffa 3aNAD ADP-ribosyltransferase 3aantioxidant activity 3aantioxidants 3ablood serum 3abrain 3acentral nervous system diseases 3achlorogenic acid 3adiabetes mellitus 3aethyl acetate 3aglucose tolerance 3ahyperglycemia 3aisomers 3alipids 3aliver 3amice 3aphenolic compounds 3aphosphotransferases (kinases) 3aprotein synthesis 3aquercetin 3arenal function 3astreptozotocin 0aHibiscus sabdariffa L. 0aStreptozotocin 0aDiabetes mellitus 0aCognitive function1 aPark, Seon Kyeong1 aKang, Jin Yong1 aKim, Jong-min,1 aPark, Sang Hyun1 aKwon, Bong Seok1 aLee, Chang Jun1 aKang, Jeong Eun1 aKim, Dae Ok1 aLee, Uk1 aHeo, Ho Jin1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3560-20070 tFood research international.g2018 Mar., v. 105 p.589-598dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl48420x0963-99697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodres.2017.11.0633Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02902naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245012400168300001600292520140100308592002801709650001301737650002201750650002401772650001401796650001001810650002601820650002001846650002601866650001101892650001401903650001301917650001201930650001301942650002401955650001601979650001701995653001802012653002002030653002402050653001302074653001302087700002002100700002402120700001602144700002202160773010802182856008502290852000902375655001202384IND60468970220221119154211.0151217e20160402xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6046897022DNAL7 a10.1080/09064710.2015.10885702doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKoga, Shiori10aInvestigating environmental factors that cause extreme gluten quality deficiency in winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.)  ap. 237-246.  aUnstable breadmaking quality of wheat due to environmental influence has been a problem for Norwegian milling industries. Large variation in gluten quality was observed from field trials with Norwegian winter wheat conducted in several locations between 2005 and 2013. Moreover, extremely poor gluten quality was observed in several locations in the 2007 and 2011 season, and indicated almost complete loss of breadmaking quality. To investigate the environmental factors which cause extremely weak gluten, gluten proteins were characterized in samples selected within the 2011 season. The results revealed that the proportion of large glutenin polymers decreased in wheat samples with extremely weak gluten. Moreover, re-polymerization of large glutenin polymers, which normally occur during the resting period of a dough, did not take place in gluten prepared from these samples. Incubation of total proteins extracted from these samples in an in vitro system showed a drastic degradation of gluten proteins indicating protease activities. The origin of the proteases remains unclear; however, exogenous proteases derived from Fusarium spp. seem to play a key role for protein degradation, and thus causing severe quality deficiency. A genotypic difference was found between the two cultivars and one of them had higher resistance against the factors influencing gluten quality in negative way.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFusarium 3aTriticum aestivum 3abreadmaking quality 3acultivars 3adough 3aenvironmental factors 3aenzyme activity 3afield experimentation 3agluten 3aglutenins 3aindustry 3amilling 3apolymers 3aprotein degradation 3aproteinases 3awinter wheat 0aWheat quality 0agluten proteins 0aprotein degradation 0aprotease 0aFusarium1 aBöcker, Ulrike1 aUhlen, Anne Kjersti1 aHoel, Bernt1 aMoldestad, Anette0 tActa agriculturæ Scandinavica.g2016 Apr. 2, v. 66, no. 3 p.237-246dTaylor & Francisx1651-19137nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09064710.2015.10885703Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02701naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245011100169300001600280520133800296592002801634650003101662650002801693650001801721650000901739650002601748650001301774651001001787651001001797653003101807653002101838653002401859653002201883700001901905700002201924700002201946700002101968700001901989700001602008700002202024773011502046856008502161852000902246655001202255IND60543883520221118020946.0190412e201508  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054388352DNAL7 a10.1016/j.meegid.2015.06.0192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYokoyama, Eiji10aComparative analysis of Mycobacterium tuberculosis Beijing strains isolated in three remote areas of Japan  ap. 444-449.  aA quantitative and qualitative comparison was carried out of Mycobacterium tuberculosis Beijing strains isolated in three remote areas of Japan. A total of 452 strains from Chiba Prefecture, 75 from Yamagata Prefecture, and 315 from Kobe City were analyzed for 24 loci by variable number of tandem repeats typing (24Beijing-VNTR). All strains were classified in six Beijing subgroups (BSUB), B1 to B5 and T, based on a minimum spanning tree reconstructed using data of a standard set of 15 VNTR loci. No significant difference was found in the distribution of strains in the BSUB in the three areas, with one exception due to a B5 outbreak in Yamagata, indicating no significant quantitative difference in the BSUB in the three areas (P<0.01, Chi-square test). In addition, when strains in each BSUB isolated in the three areas were mixed and standardized index of association (IAs) and variance (ΦPT) values were calculated, no significant qualitative difference in the BSUB in the three areas was found. These results suggested that the BSUB diverged prior to the introduction of M. tuberculosis Beijing strains into Japan. Differences in the distribution of strains in each BSUB between Japan and continental Asian countries suggested there had been genetic drift in the continental Asian countries in which B4 had been dominant.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMycobacterium tuberculosis 3achi-square distribution 3agenetic drift 3aloci 3aminisatellite repeats 3avariance 3aChina 3aJapan 0aMycobacterium tuberculosis 0aBeijing subgroup 0aPopulation genetics 0aGenetic diversity1 aHachisu, Yushi1 aIwamoto, Tomotada1 aNakanishi, Noriko1 aArikawa, Kentaro1 aWada, Takayuki1 aSeto, Junji1 aKishida, Kazunori0 tInfection, genetics, and evolution.g2015 Aug., v. 34 p.444-449dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12450x1567-13487nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.meegid.2015.06.0193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02200naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004000092040001800132100001500150245009200165300001600257520107800273592002801351650001301379650001701392650001301409650001401422650001901436650001701455650001601472650002101488650001401509650001701523650002401540650001401564650002501578700001601603773010001619856008601719852000901805655001201814IND4468397620221119104030.0141111e201207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446839762DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jfoodeng.2012.01.0162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKuhn, K.R.10aFlaxseed oil – Whey protein isolate emulsions: Effect of high pressure homogenization  ap. 449-457.  aThe effect of high-pressure homogenization (20–100MPa) and the number of homogenization cycles (1–7) on the stability of flaxseed oil - whey protein isolate emulsions was evaluated. All the emulsions were stable to creaming for at least 9d of storage. An increase in homogenization pressure from 20 to 80MPa and number of passes through the homogenizer up to 3, decreased the mean droplet size of the O/W emulsions despite the higher polydispersity. Emulsions homogenized at lower pressures (20MPa) showed a monomodal distribution of the particles, whereas, an increase in pressure to 80MPa led to a bimodal distribution, indicating droplets coalescence. High-pressure homogenization (80MPa) and an increase in the number of homogenization cycles, led to the formation of high molecular weight aggregates (>200kDa), which favored an increase in viscosity of the emulsions. The increase in homogenization pressure also increased the formation of primary oxidation products, which could be explained by the increase in temperature and in the surface area of the droplets.  aPublisher supplied data 3acreaming 3adroplet size 3adroplets 3aemulsions 3ahomogenization 3ahomogenizers 3alinseed oil 3amolecular weight 3aoxidation 3asurface area 3asurface temperature 3aviscosity 3awhey protein isolate1 aCunha, R.L.0 tJournal of food engineering.g2012 July, v. 111, no. 2 p.449-457dElsevier Ltdx0260-87747nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jfoodeng.2012.01.0163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02811naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002100150245012600171300001600297520152600313592002801839650001501867650001801882650001601900650001001916650001801926650001101944650000901955650002001964650003401984650001502018650001002033650002702043650001202070653001002082653000902092653003602101653001402137700001702151773011502168856008502283852000902368655001202377IND60543880020221118021033.0190412e201508  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054388002DNAL7 a10.1016/j.meegid.2015.06.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBasharat, Zarrin10aIn silico assessment of phosphorylation and O-β-GlcNAcylation sites in human NPC1 protein critical for Ebola virus entry  ap. 326-338.  aEbola is a highly pathogenic enveloped virus responsible for deadly outbreaks of severe hemorrhagic fever. It enters human cells by binding a multifunctional cholesterol transporter Niemann–Pick C1 (NPC1) protein. Post translational modification (PTM) information for NPC1 is crucial to understand Ebola virus (EBOV) entry and action due to changes in phosphorylation or glycosylation at the binding site. It is difficult and costly to experimentally assess this type of interaction, so in silico strategy was employed. Identification of phosphorylation sites, including conserved residues that could be possible targets for 21 predicted kinases was followed by interplay study between phosphorylation and O-β-GlcNAc modification of NPC1. Results revealed that only 4 out of 48 predicted phosphosites exhibited O-β-GlcNAc activity. Predicted outcomes were integrated with residue conservation and 3D structural information. Three Yin Yang sites were located in the α-helix regions and were conserved in studied vertebrate and mammalian species. Only one modification site S425 was found in β-turn region located near the N-terminus of NPC1 and was found to differ in pig, mouse, cobra and humans. The predictions suggest that Yin Yang sites may not be important for virus attachment to NPC1, whereas phosphosite 473 may be important for binding and hence entry of Ebola virus. This information could be useful in addressing further experimental studies and therapeutic strategies targeting PTM events in EBOV entry.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEbolavirus 3abinding sites 3acholesterol 3afever 3aglycosylation 3ahumans 3amice 3aphosphorylation 3aphosphotransferases (kinases) 3aprediction 3aswine 3atranslation (genetics) 3aviruses 0aEbola 0aNPC1 0aPost translational modification 0aIn silico1 aYasmin, Azra0 tInfection, genetics, and evolution.g2015 Aug., v. 34 p.326-338dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12450x1567-13487nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.meegid.2015.06.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03780naa a2200697 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245014600171520170300317592002802020650001802048650003102066650002102097650001002118650002102128650001602149650000902165650002302174650001502197650002202212650001602234650001302250650002202263650001402285650001602299650002402315650002302339650002202362650001002384650001002394650000902404650002502413653001002438653002402448653002002472653001902492653001702511700002002528700002302548700002502571700001802596700002002614700002102634700001902655700002402674700002002698700002902718700001702747700002002764700002102784700002102805700003102826773011802857856008602975852000903061655001203070IND60685226720221120175217.0200419e202005  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068522672DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jnutbio.2020.1083612doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBenlebna, Melha10aLong-term high intake of 9-PAHPA or 9-OAHPA increases basal metabolism and insulin sensitivity but disrupts liver homeostasis in healthy mice  aBranched fatty acid esters of hydroxy fatty acids (FAHFAs) are a new family of endogenous lipids recently discovered. Several studies reported that some FAHFAs have antidiabetic and anti-inflammatory effects. The objective of this study was to explore the impact of two FAHFAs, 9-PAHPA or 9-OAHPA, on the metabolism of mice. C57Bl/6J male mice, 6 weeks old, were divided into 3 groups of 10 mice each. One group received a control diet and the two others groups received the control diet supplemented with 9-PAHPA or 9-OAHPA for 12 weeks. Mouse weight and body composition were monitored throughout the study. Some days before euthanasia, energy expenditure, glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity were also determined. After sacrifice, blood and organs were collected for relevant molecular, biochemical and histological analyses. Although high intake of 9-PAHPA or 9-OAHPA increased basal metabolism, it had no direct effect on body weight. Interestingly, the 9-PAHPA or 9-OAHPA intake increased insulin sensitivity but without modifying glucose tolerance. Nevertheless, 9-PAHPA intake induced a loss of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. Surprisingly, both studied FAHFAs induced hepatic steatosis and fibrosis in some mice, which were more marked with 9-PAHPA. Finally, a slight remodeling of white adipose tissue was also observed with 9-PAHPA intake. In conclusion, the long-term high intake of 9-PAHPA or 9-OAHPA increased basal metabolism and insulin sensitivity in healthy mice. However, this effect, highly likely beneficial in a diabetic state, was accompanied by manifest liver damage in certain mice that should deserve special attention in both healthy and pathological studies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal models 3aanti-inflammatory activity 3abasal metabolism 3ablood 3abody composition 3abody weight 3adiet 3aenergy expenditure 3aeuthanasia 3afatty acid esters 3afatty liver 3afibrosis 3aglucose tolerance 3ahistology 3ahomeostasis 3ahydroxy fatty acids 3ainsulin resistance 3ainsulin secretion 3aliver 3amales 3amice 3awhite adipose tissue 0aFAHFA 0aInsulin sensitivity 0aLiver steatosis 0aLiver fibrosis 0aInflammation1 aBalas, Laurence1 aBonafos, Béatrice1 aPessemesse, Laurence1 aVigor, Claire1 aGrober, Jacques1 aBernex, Florence1 aFouret, Gilles1 aPaluchova, Veronika1 aGaillet, Sylvie1 aLandrier, Jean François1 aKuda, Ondrej1 aDurand, Thierry1 aCoudray, Charles1 aCasas, François1 aFeillet-Coudray, Christine0 tJournal of nutritional biochemistry.g2020 May, v. 79 p.108361-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl44770x0955-28637nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jnutbio.2020.1083613Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02772naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002000152245015800172300001600330520164800346592002801994650001102022650001802033650001102051650001502062650001102077650000902088650001302097650001402110650001102124650001802135650002302153651001602176700002502192773008602217856008602303852000902389655001202398IND60084278620221119182354.0141101e20120301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008427862DNAL7 a10.1016/j.geomorph.2011.12.0372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJones, Katie E.10aSpatial and temporal patterns of off-slope sediment delivery for small catchments subject to shallow landslides within the Waipaoa catchment, New Zealand  ap. 150-159.  aThe Waipaoa catchment in New Zealand has one of the highest measured specific suspended sediment yields measured in New Zealand compared to basins of comparable size. A significant source of this sediment is from shallow landslides which are often triggered on a regional scale during large magnitude storm events, defined as ~200mm rainfall within 72h. The first step of this sediment cascade is removal of landslide material from the slope and into the fluvial system when the debris tail is in physical contact and hence considered connected. The difference between the volume of sediment liberated in the event and the volume remaining on the slope immediately following the event is termed the off-slope sediment delivery ratio. This value ranged from 0.12 to 0.28 for small sub-catchments within the Waipaoa catchment depending on catchment morphology, landslide and triggering event characteristics. In the Waipaoa catchment a decrease in the catchment sediment delivery ratio is observed as the sub-catchment size increased. A human induced process which may affect off-slope sediment delivery is regolith exhaustion, as scars move further upslope in response to removal of preferred weathered material during previous events on the lower sections of slope. However, it appears that temporal scar migration away from the channels is not prevalent. Therefore, the hypothesis that hillslope relaxation since deforestation is prevalent in this setting is considered null. Rather the temporal pattern to sediment delivery ratios supports the context of evolving catchment in response to deforestation in the Terrain Event Resistance Model.  aPublisher supplied data 3abasins 3adeforestation 3ahumans 3alandslides 3amodels 3arain 3aregolith 3asediments 3astorms 3asubwatersheds 3asuspended sediment 3aNew Zealand1 aPreston, Nicholas J.0 tGeomorphology.g2012 Mar. 1, v. 141-142 p.150-159dElsevier B.V.x0169-555X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.geomorph.2011.12.0373Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02585naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001900153245009500172300001600267520149000283592002801773650002301801650001401824650001601838650001601854650002401870650001501894650001901909651001001928700001901938700001801957700002101975700001601996773011502012856008702127852000902214655001202223IND60084718220221120184859.0141101e201305  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008471822DNAL7 a10.1016/j.isprsjprs.2013.02.0212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPesci, Arianna12aA laser scanning-based method for fast estimation of seismic-induced building deformations  ap. 185-198.  aMonitoring damaged buildings in an area where an earthquake has occurred requires the use of techniques which provide rapid and safe measurements even in emergency conditions. In particular, remote sensing techniques like terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) can satisfy these requirements, since they produce very dense point clouds in little time and also allow an accurate geometric modeling of observed buildings. Nevertheless, strong constraints on TLS data acquisition geometry, such as acquisition distance and incidence angles, typically characterize an area in seismic emergency conditions. In order to correctly interpret the data, it is necessary to estimate errors affecting TLS measurements in these critical conditions. A reliable estimation can be achieved by means of experiments and numerical simulations aimed at quantifying a realistic noise level, with emphasis on reduction of artifacts due to data acquisition, registration and modeling. This paper proposes a data analysis strategy in which TLS-based morphological maps computed as point-to-primitive differences are created. The method can be easily used for accurate surveying in emergency conditions. In order to demonstrate the proposed method in very diverse situations, it was applied to rapidly detect deformation traces in the San Giacomo Roncole Campanile (Modena), the Asinelli tower (Bologna) and the Cantalovo Church (Verona), three buildings damaged by the Mw 5.9 Emilia Romagna 2012 earthquake (Italy).  aPublisher supplied data 3aangle of incidence 3abuildings 3adeformation 3aearthquakes 3amathematical models 3amonitoring 3aremote sensing 3aItaly1 aTeza, Giordano1 aBonali, Elena1 aCasula, Giuseppe1 aBoschi, E.,0 tISPRS journal of photogrammetry and remote sensing.g2013 May, v. 79 p.185-198dElsevier B.V.x0924-27167nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.isprsjprs.2013.02.0213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02976naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245006100168300001600229520184700245592002802092650001502120650001202135650001802147650001102165650002202176650001502198650001902213653001502232653001602247653001702263653001602280653002202296700002002318700001702338700002202355773011102377856008102488852000902569655001202578IND60557841420221119201937.0190426e201609  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055784142DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jef.2016.09.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChung, Hae-Kyung10aAesthetics of Korean foods: The symbol of Korean culture  ap. 178-188.  aAdvances in transportation and communication have broken down critical barriers within the global economy, pushing us towards a more unified world. In keeping with this trend, processes of communication, transportation, and production are becoming increasingly standardized, mechanized, and automated. Yet as this global era of uniformity progresses, people and individuals will inevitably encounter identity confusion. Numerous individuals, ethnicities, nationalities, and countries around the world are working to counteract such identity confusion. As globalization progresses, groups and nationalities that fail to preserve their identities will dwindle and become absorbed by stronger entities. Therefore, many societies are investing great efforts into rediscovering and revamping their indigenous traditions, cultures, and customs. When travelers visit another country, one of the simplest avenues for them to experience the local culture is food. Unlike other cultural elements, many of which have become diluted because of globalization, native cuisines are still perceived as retaining the traditions, uniqueness, and diversity of individual cultures. It is more important than ever for people and countries to expand and preserve their respective cultural currencies. In this respect, taking a cultural approach to Korean cuisine is a fascinating and meaningful endeavor. In light of the recent publication of a few articles dealing with the symbolic significance and meaning behind Korean cuisine, an effort to compile a list of the distinctive cultural properties of Korean food seems vital. Furthermore, presenting the aesthetics of Korean food through a method that integrates science and culture is a very significant task. The authors of this paper firmly believe in its potential to advance the globalization of Korean food.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaesthetics 3acuisine 3aglobalization 3apeople 3atraditional foods 3atraditions 3atransportation 0aaesthetics 0aethnic food 0afood culture 0aKorean food 0asymbolic analysis1 aYang, Hye Jeong1 aShin, Dayeon1 aChung, Kyung Rhan0 tJournal of ethnic foods.g2016 Sept., v. 3, no. 3 p.178-188dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23306x2352-619X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jef.2016.09.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03189naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002800150245007800178300001600256500001500272520158400287592002801871650002301899650002101922650001401943650001301957650001301970650001901983650001402002650002402016650001002040651000902050651001102059653002102070653002402091653003702115653002602152653001902178653002202197700002002219700001702239700002102256700001902277700002302296700002002319700001902339700002202358700002702380700001902407773011502426856008502541852000902626655001202635IND60543880320221118021048.0190412e201407  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054388032DNAL7 a10.1016/j.meegid.2014.04.0162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZehender, Gianguglielmo10aPhylogeography and phylodynamics of European genotype 3 hepatitis E virus  ap. 138-143.  a2019-12-06  aHepatitis E virus is classified into four genotypes that have different geographical and host distributions. The main cause of sporadic autochthonous type E acute hepatitis in developed countries is genotype 3, which has a worldwide distribution and widely infects pigs. The aim of this study was to make hypotheses concerning the origin and global dispersion routes of this genotype by reconstructing the spatial and temporal dynamics of 208 HEV genotype 3 ORF-2 sequences (retrieved from public databases) isolated in different geographical areas.The evolutionary rates, time of the most recent common ancestors (tMRCAs), epidemic growth and phylogeography of HEV-3 were co-estimated using a MCMC Bayesian method.The maximum clade credibility tree showed the existence of two distinct main clades: clade A, which consists of only European subtypes (HEV-3e and 3f), and clade B, which consists of European subtype 3c and all of the Asian subtypes (3a, 3b and 3d) sharing a common ancestor, which most probably existed in Asia in 1920s. All of the North American isolates belonged to Asian subtype 3a.On the basis of our time-scaled phylogeographical reconstruction, we hypothesise that after originating in the early 1800s in Europe, HEV reached Asia in the first decades of 1900, and then moved to America probably in the 1970s–1980s.Analysis of the skyline plot showed a sharp increase of the number of infections between the 1980s and 2005, thus suggesting the intervention of new and highly efficient routes of transmission possibly related to changes in the pig industry.  aPublisher supplied data 3atemporal variation 3aOrthohepevirus A 3ahepatitis 3aancestry 3agenotype 3aphylogeography 3adatabases 3adeveloped countries 3aswine 3aAsia 3aEurope 0aHEV epidemiology 0aMolecular evolution 0aPhylogeography and phylodynamics 0aZoonoses surveillance 0aHEV genotype 3 0aHepatitis E virus1 aEbranati, Erika1 aLai, Alessia1 aLuzzago, Camilla1 aPaladini, Sara1 aTagliacarne, Catia1 aGalli, Cristina1 aGalli, Massimo1 aCiccozzi, Massimo1 aZanetti, Alessandro R.1 aRomanò, Luisa0 tInfection, genetics, and evolution.g2014 July, v. 25 p.138-143dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12450x1567-13487nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.meegid.2014.04.0163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02446naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001300145245010300158300001600261520122600277592002801503650001901531650001601550650001201566650001501578650001301593650000701606650001801613650003301631650003501664650001601699650001801715700001601733700001801749700001601767700001601783700001501799700001601814773010401830856008101934852000902015655001202024IND4468965820221119104005.0141111e201110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446896582DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fbp.2010.08.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Jun10aSupercritical fluid extraction of flavonoids from Maydis stigma and its nitrite-scavenging ability  ap. 333-339.  aSupercritical fluid carbon dioxide (SF-CO₂) extraction (SFE) of flavonoids from Maydis stigma and its nitrite-scavenging ability were investigated. The effects of extraction time, particle size and co-solvent composition in terms of water content in ethanol were first optimized. Then, a Box–Behnken design combined with response surface methodology (RSM) was employed to study the effects of three independent variables (temperature, pressure and co-solvent amount) on the extraction yield of flavonoids. A maximal extraction yield of flavonoids of approximately 4.24mg/g of M. stigma by SFE was obtained under optimal conditions (a temperature of 50.88°C, a pressure of 41.80MPa, a co-solvent amount of 2.488mL/g and an extraction time of 120min with 0.4-mm particle sizes and 20% aqueous ethanol as the co-solvent). Furthermore, the nitrite-scavenging ability of the flavonoid-enriched SFE extracts was assessed using the Griess reagent. The flavonoid-enriched SFE extracts exhibited the highest scavenging ability on nitrite (88.1±3.04%) at the concentration of 500μg/mL and at pH 3.0. The nitrite-scavenging ability of the extracts appeared to be concentration dependent but negatively correlated with the pH.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon dioxide 3acorrelation 3aethanol 3aflavonoids 3anitrites 3apH 3aparticle size 3aresponse surface methodology 3asupercritical fluid extraction 3atemperature 3awater content1 aLin, Songyi1 aWang, Zuozhao1 aWang, Cuina1 aWang, Erlei1 aZhang, Yan1 aLiu, Jingbo0 tFood and bioproducts processing.g2011 Oct., v. 89, no. 4 p.333-339dElsevier B.V.x0960-30857nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fbp.2010.08.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01667naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100001500142245012100157300001400278520061900292592002800911653001300939653001300952653001900965653001400984653001400998653001501012700001501027700001901042700001701061700001501078700002101093773011601114856007801230852000901308655001201317IND60124233820221123013332.0151025e201003  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012423382DNAL7 a10.4001/003.018.01032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSychra, O.14aThe Chewing Lice (Phthiraptera) of Red-Billed Quelea (Quelea quelea) in Senegal, with a Description of a New Species  ap. 17-22.  aOne hundred and six individuals of red-billed quelea (Quelea quelea) were examined for chewing lice (Phthiraptera: Amblycera, Ischnocera) in Senegal.

The method is applied to the Dutch coast but is generically applicable, provided of course the sufficient availability of data. The DUROS+ model in its most basic form was used to quantitatively assess dune resilience. The Monte Carlo method was used for the probabilistic investigation. Important research questions were (1) where can the DUROS+ model in combination with the fully probabilistic approach be applied along the Dutch coast? and (2) what is the alongshore variability of failure probability using this probabilistic approach? The main conclusion of the work presented in this paper is that the fully probabilistic approach provides valuable added insight with respect to the actual failure probability of transects. At the same time it is noted that the current dune erosion model in its most basic form is not able to cover all of the Dutch coast. Reasons lie in the availability of sufficient quality boundary conditions, applicability limits associated with model assumptions and insufficient quality coastal profile information. To extend the coverage of the analysis of failure probabilities along the Dutch coast it is recommended (1) to involve more process-based model concepts that can cope with the situations DUROS+ cannot, and (2) to expand currently available data on boundary conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMonte Carlo method 3acoasts 3amodels 3aprobability 3avalue added1 aBaart, Fedor1 aKoningsveld, Mark van,0 tGeomorphology.g2012 Mar. 15, v. 143-144 p.95-103dElsevier B.V.x0169-555X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.geomorph.2011.09.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03816naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100006000152245010200212300001600314520192800330592002802258650004402286650002202330650002102352650001202373650001402385650002302399650001702422650002802439650001302467650000902480650001402489650001302503650001802516650001602534650001302550650001202563650001602575650001202591650003702603650003702640650000902677650001502686651001302701653001202714653002102726653002702747700002202774700002302796700002002819700002102839700002302860700002102883700002502904700002302929700002302952773010702975856008703082852000903169655001203178IND60591225820221119205952.0190410e201802  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059122582DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biombioe.2017.12.0222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTsoncheva, Tanya1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8202-901210aActivated carbon from Bulgarian peach stones as a support of catalysts for methanol decomposition  ap. 135-146.  aThis study is aimed at the development of intelligent integrated scheme for full utilization of biomass for clean energy production. The proposed approach includes production of activated carbon based catalysts for methanol decomposition as a source of hydrogen, where both activated carbon and methanol, could be produced from biomass. In order to elucidate the impact of different activated carbon characteristics on the formation of the catalytic active phase, carbons with different texture and surface functionality are purposely obtained by changes in the activation temperature during the carbon preparation and its post-synthetic treatment with nitric acid. Peach stones, widely available in Bulgaria and Balkans region, are chosen as activated carbons precursor. Iron, zinc and ferrite modifications of thus obtained carbons are prepared by incipient wetness impregnation technique and nitrogen physisorption, XRD, HRTEM, UV-Vis, FTIR, Moessbauer spectroscopy, TPR with hydrogen and Boehm method are used for samples characterization. It is established that the state and catalytic activity of the supported metal oxide particles could be easily controlled by the procedure of the activated carbon preparation and this effect strongly depends on the nature of the loaded metal oxide. In case of iron modifications, the increase of the activation temperature during the carbon preparation promotes the formation of more finely dispersed, accessible for the reactants and active in methanol decomposition magnetite particles. The dispersion and the accessibility of the zinc oxide species in zinc modifications are improved by the formation of additional amount of surface acidic groups during the carbon pre-treatment with nitric acid. The combination of lower temperature of carbon activation with nitric acid pre-treatment promotes the formation of highly active ferrite nanoparticles in the binary modifications.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aX-ray diffraction 3aactivated carbon 3abiomass 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3aclean energy 3aferrimagnetic materials 3ahydrogen 3airon 3amagnetite 3amethanol 3ananoparticles 3anitric acid 3anitrogen 3apeaches 3atemperature 3atexture 3atransmission electron microscopy 3aultraviolet-visible spectroscopy 3azinc 3azinc oxide 3aBulgaria 0aBiomass 0aActivated carbon 0aMethanol decomposition1 aMileva, Alexandra1 aTsyntsarski, Boyko1 aPaneva, Daniela1 aSpassova, Ivanka1 aKovacheva, Daniela1 aVelinov, Nikolay1 aKarashanova, Daniela1 aGeorgieva, Biliana1 aPetrov, Nartzislav0 tBiomass and bioenergy.g2018 Feb., v. 109 p.135-146dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl3929140x0961-95347nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biombioe.2017.12.0223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02171naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100002000142245014500162300001400307520118500321592002801506653003201534653000801566653000801574653001601582653002701598653002301625700001801648773011601666856007801782852000901860655001201869IND60124234020221123013407.0151025e201003  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012423402DNAL7 a10.4001/003.018.01052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAardt, W.J. van14aThe Effect of Temperature on the pH, d-Lactate and Haemocyanin Oxygen Affinity of Opistophthalmus latimanus (Koch) (Scorpionidae) Haemolymph  ap. 29-37.  aThe pH and d-lactate of the haemolymph from the scorpion, Opistophthalmus latimanus, were measured at different ambient temperatures. The oxygen affinity and molecular cooperativities of haemocyanin in its native and dialysed form were determined when exposed to different ambient temperatures. D-lactate concentration in native haemolymph increased significantly from 0.31 mmol/l at 7 °°C to 1.93 mmol/l when haemolymph was exposed to 25 °°C for 6 hours but decreases to 0.32 mmol/l at 37 °°C The extinction coefficients of O. latimanus haemocyanin at 240 nm and 278 nm were 2.41 and 11.26, respectively, and correspond well with similar data on the crustacean Limulus polyphemus. The subunit cooperativity (n₅₀) of the native haemocyanin molecule increased linearly from n = 3.00 to n = 5.34 at 37 °°C. A d-lactate effect on n₅₀ between pH 7.40 and 7.87 could be demonstrated while the heat of oxygenation (ΔΔH) was -127.64 kJ/mol between 17 °°C and 25 °°C Like other scorpions investigated, haemocyanin of O. latimanus exposed to wide temperature regimes show a strong temperature dependence of oxygen affinity (as P₅₀) and cooperativity (as n₅₀).  aPublisher supplied data 0aHaemocyanin/oxygen affinity 0an50 0aP50 0aBohr-effect 0ahaemolymph [d-lactate] 0aSpA of haemocyanin1 aRoux, J.M. le0 tAfrican entomology.g2010 Mar., v. 18, no. 1 p.29-37dEntomological Society of Southern Africax1021-35897nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.4001%2F003.018.01053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04001naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245013800163300001600301520249300317592002802810650001602838650001902854650002502873650001002898650001902908650001302927650003802940650001602978650001602994650001003010650001603020650001303036650002103049650001103070650001303081650001503094650002003109653002003129653001203149653001103161653001303172653003203185653002303217700002403240700001603264773011203280856008203392852000903474655001203483IND60567710220221119074336.0190411e201707  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056771022DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fsi.2017.04.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCao, Yanran10aEstablishment of a non-invasive method for stress evaluation in farmed salmon based on direct fecal corticoid metabolites measurement  ap. 317-324.  aFish welfare is an important issue for growth of the aquaculture industry. Stress responses represent animal's natural reactions to challenging conditions and could be used as a welfare indicator. Cortisol level is relevant to fish welfare condition, and is a readily measured component of the primary stress response system. Generally, cortisol is measured by blood sampling. However, fish blood cortisol level could be instantly influenced by handling-stress at sampling. Fecal corticoid metabolites (FCM) are a mixture of several different metabolites with a wide range of polarities. Thus, feces could be promising alternative less handling-sensitive and non-invasive biological matrices for cortisol evaluation in Atlantic salmon. In this study we developed non-invasive method for determination of fecal corticoid metabolites in farmed Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar L.) using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).It was demonstrated that salmon FCM extracted from salmon feces is insoluble in non-polar solvents like diethyl ether, but well soluble in polar solvents like methanol. The proper extraction ratio could be one ml 100% methanol for 100 μL of the liquid part of salmon feces or 100 mg of the solid part. The FCM directly detected in unextracted liquid part of feces correlated well with the FCM extracted from both liquid and solid part of the corresponding samples, without significant difference. Thus, it is feasible to measure FCM directly in the liquid part of salmon feces without any extraction procedure.Then, we applied this assay for FCM analysis in the group of salmon that experienced salmon pancreas disease (PD) and amoebic gill disease (AGD). We demonstrated 1) both plasma cortisol and FCM increased significantly during the outbreak of inflammatory disease (P < 0.01). Plasma cortisol level was elevated from 28 ± 40 ng/ml to 164.4 ± 62.5 ng/ml, FCM from 14.4 ± 13.2 ng/ml to 170.7 ± 89.7 ng/ml 2) Growth and starvation has no significant impact on either cortisol or FCM level. 3) FCM correlated well with plasma cortisol level (P < 0.01). Furthermore, there seems more individual variation in plasma cortisol levels than in FCM levels.These results suggest FCM could be directly analyzed in liquid part of salmon feces without extraction. This directly detected FCM level could represent the total fecal FCM level and plasma cortisol level. This simple and non-invasive method makes FCM a proper indicator for salmon welfare.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSalmo salar 3aanimal welfare 3aaquaculture industry 3ablood 3ablood sampling 3acortisol 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3aethyl ether 3afarmed fish 3afeces 3ametabolites 3amethanol 3apancreas disease 3asalmon 3asolvents 3astarvation 3astress response 0aAtlantic salmon 0aWelfare 0aStress 0aCortisol 0aFecal corticoid metabolites 0aInfectious disease1 aTveten, Ann-Kristin1 aStene, Anne0 tFish & shellfish immunology.g2017 July, v. 66 p.317-324dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl4175048x1050-46487nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fsi.2017.04.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02504naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001500150245012900165520130200294592002801596650000801624650001101632650003101643650000901674650001301683650001501696650002501711650002001736653002101756653003001777653002301807653002301830700001801853700001501871700001701886700001901903773009001922856008502012852000902097655001202106IND60769463620221119193800.0220426e20220615xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076946362DNAL7 a10.1016/j.energy.2022.1236062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Cong10aPerformance comparison of three chemical precooled turbine engine cycles using methanol and n-decane as the precooling fuels  aPrecooled turbine engines are promising power for next generation in- and trans-atmospheric vehicles. A novel chemical precooling technology was proposed in our previous paper to reduce the fuel consumption by improving the chemical heat sink of fuels. However, the appropriate configuration design for chemical precooled engine cycle has not been revealed. This paper proposed an overall-view analysis method to distinguish the effects of different configurations/parameters on the engine performance, from which the configuration could be parameterized via a unified thermodynamic model. To improve the simulation precision of this model, the heat sink of fuel was measured by test. Through calculation, the results indicated that the utilization of working ability of the heated fuel was an effective way to improve the engine performances, and the cycle adopting both rocket turbine and gas turbine could increase the highest flight Mach number by 7.06%. Besides, the optimal engine performance could be obtained when the equivalence ratio was equal to 1.0. Moreover, the engine performance was more sensitive to air side pressure recovery coefficient of pre-cooler at smaller pressure ratio range; while for the larger pressure ratio, the efficiency of air compressor was the dominant factor.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3aenergy 3aenergy use and consumption 3aheat 3amethanol 3aprecooling 3athermodynamic models 3aturbine engines 0aPrecooled engine 0aThermodynamic performance 0aChemical heat sink 0aMultispecies model1 aCheng, Kunlin1 aQin, Jiang1 aShao, Jiahui1 aHuang, Hongyan0 tEnergy.g2022 June 15, v. 249 p.123606-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12436x0360-54427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2022.1236063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01589naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100005500149245009600204500002200300520058900322592002800911653002400939653002600963653003200989653002301021653002101044700005501065700002001120773005501140856008301195852000901278655001201287IND60557841820221119202316.0161103s2016    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055784182DNAL7 a10.1016/j.softx.2016.08.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPereira, G.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6991-885110aFBG_SiMul V1.0: Fibre Bragg grating signal simulation tool for finite element method models  aPre-press version  aFBG_SiMul V1.0 is a tool to study and design the implementation of fibre Bragg grating (FBG) sensors solutions in any arbitrary loaded structure or application.

Porcine hemoglobin and whole blood were hydrolyzed by endo- and exo-peptidases. The presence of exopeptidases reduced the bitterness and altered the volatile profiles of protein hydrolysates. Exopeptidase treatment can release terminal amino acids from peptides, which in turn may contribute to formation of volatile compounds by Maillard reactions. In contrast, endopeptidases conferred a slightly bitter taste and different volatile profiles. For hemoglobin hydrolysates, principal component analysis revealed that proteases were categorized into three groups based on endo- or exo-peptidase activity. Whole blood is a more complex raw material, yet the proteases were still categorized in a similar fashion. This work contributes to understanding structural characteristics responsible for taste and volatile profiles of protein hydrolysates.  aPublisher supplied data 3aamino acids 3abitterness 3ablood 3aenzyme activity 3ahemoglobin 3ahydrolysates 3apeptides 3aprincipal component analysis 3aprotein hydrolysates 3aproteinases 3araw materials 3aswine 3ataste 3avolatile compounds 0aHemoglobin 0aBlood 0aProtein hydrolysates 0aExopeptidase 0aVolatile compounds 0aTaste1 aBak, Kathrine H.1 aLiu, Jing1 aDe Gobba, Cristian1 aTøstesen, Marie1 aHansen, Erik T.1 aPetersen, Mikael A.1 aRuiz Carrascal, Jorge,1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7905-31531 aBredie, Wender L.P.1 aLametsch, René1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4189-806X0 tFood research international.g2019 July, v. 121 p.28-38dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl48420x0963-99697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodres.2019.03.0173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02561naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002700152245012600179300001600305520138300321592002801704650002001732650001801752650001501770650002401785650000901809650002201818651001001840700002601850700001801876700002401894700002401918700002401942773013801966856008602104852000902190655001202199IND60742416220221119232447.0210624e20210407xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074241622DNAL7 a10.3390/agriengineering30200122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPaidipati, Kiran Kumar10aPrediction of Rice Cultivation in India—Support Vector Regression Approach with Various Kernels for Non-Linear Patterns  ap. 182-198.  aThe prediction of rice yields plays a major role in reducing food security problems in India and also suggests that government agencies manage the over or under situations of production. Advanced machine learning techniques are playing a vital role in the accurate prediction of rice yields in dealing with nonlinear complex situations instead of traditional statistical methods. In the present study, the researchers made an attempt to predict the rice yield through support vector regression (SVR) models with various kernels (linear, polynomial, and radial basis function) for India overall and the top five rice producing states by considering influence parameters, such as the area under cultivation and production, as independent variables for the years 1962–2018. The best-fitted models were chosen based on the cross-validation and hyperparameter optimization of various kernel parameters. The root-mean-square error (RMSE) and mean absolute error (MAE) were calculated for the training and testing datasets. The results revealed that SVR with various kernels fitted to India overall, as well as the major rice producing states, would explore the nonlinear patterns to understand the precise situations of yield prediction. This study will be helpful for farmers as well as the central and state governments for estimating rice yield in advance with optimal resources.  aPublisher supplied data 3adata collection 3afood security 3aprediction 3aregression analysis 3arice 3ayield forecasting 3aIndia1 aChesneau, Christophe 1 aNayana, B.

In this process, glycerol-based acrolein is dimerized, carbonated, and oxidized, thus producing the highly reactive diepoxy functional ethylene carbonate (DOC), which by facile chemical CO₂ fixation yields high purity STC. Opposite to most state-of-the-art multifunctional five-membered cyclic carbonates and regardless of the feedstock used for its manufacture, STC enables amine curing at ambient temperature even in the absence of catalysts. According to FT-IR and NMR spectroscopic analyses of the amine/carbonate reaction kinetics, the internal cyclic carbonate group is 3 times more reactive with respect to the two terminal carbonate groups. This is attributed to the electron-withdrawing effect of terminal cyclic carbonates. Curing STC with a blend of bio-based flexible and rigid diamines such as dimer fatty acid-based diamine (Priamine 1074) and isophorone diamine affords poly(carbohydrate–urethane) thermosets and NIPU coatings exhibiting substantially improved thermal and mechanical properties.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aacrolein 3aambient temperature 3acarbon dioxide fixation 3acarbonates 3acatalysts 3acoatings 3adiamines 3aethylene 3afeedstocks 3aglycerol 3amanufacturing 3amechanical properties 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3areaction kinetics 3asorbitol 3aspectral analysis1 aRitter, Benjamin S.1 aKratzert, D.1 aBruchmann, Bernd1 aMülhaupt, Rolf0 tMacromolecules.g2016 Oct. 11, v. 49, no. 19 p.7268-7276dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-58357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.macromol.6b014853Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04169naa a2200673 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001700094024002100111024003100132024002200163024001900185040001800204100002300222245011100245300001800356506007600374506017300450520178000623506003702403650002202440650001202462650002502474650002902499650001902528650001002547650001702557650002002574650001302594650001302607650001802620650001202638650000902650650001202659650001702671650001902688650002502707650001302732650003502745700002002780700002202800700001902822700001502841700002202856700002002878700002502898700002002923700001702943700002202960700002002982773008703002856011203089856004403201956022003245961000903465852000903474655001203483IND50068015020221214224053.0130618s2013    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006801502DNAL7 a2896142aris7 a10113/568582hdl7 a10.1534/g3.113.0055952doi7 aPMC36897982pmcid7 a235895192pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHirsch, Candice N.10aRetrospective View of North American Potato (Solanum tuberosum L.)

Breeding efforts have relied on phenotypic selection of populations developed from intra- and intermarket class crosses and introgressions of wild and cultivated Solanum relatives. To retrospectively explore the effects of potato breeding at the genome level, we used 8303 single-nucleotide polymorphism markers to genotype a 250-line diversity panel composed of wild species, genetic stocks, and cultivated potato lines with release dates ranging from 1857 to 2011. Population structure analysis revealed four subpopulations within the panel, with cultivated potato lines grouping together and separate from wild species and genetic stocks. With pairwise kinship estimates clear separation between potato market classes was observed. Modern breeding efforts have scarcely changed the percentage of heterozygous loci or the frequency of homozygous, single-dose, and duplex loci on a genome level, despite concerted efforts by breeders. In contrast, clear selection in less than 50 years of breeding was observed for alleles in biosynthetic pathways important for market class-specific traits such as pigmentation and carbohydrate composition. Although improvement and diversification for distinct market classes was observed through whole-genome analysis of historic and current potato lines, an increased rate of gain from selection will be required to meet growing global food demands and challenges due to climate change. Understanding the genetic basis of diversification and trait improvement will allow for more rapid genome-guided improvement of potato in future breeding efforts.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aSolanum tuberosum 3aalleles 3abiochemical pathways 3acarbohydrate composition 3aclimate change 3afoods 3afresh market 3agenetic markers 3agenomics 3agenotype 3aintrogression 3akinship 3aloci 3amarkets 3apigmentation 3aplant breeding 3apopulation structure 3apotatoes 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism1 aHirsch, Cory D.1 aFelcher, Kimberly1 aCoombs, Joseph1 aZarka, Dan1 aVan Deynze, Allen1 aDe Jong, Walter1 aVeilleux, Richard E.1 aJansky, Shelley1 aBethke, Paul1 aDouches, David S.1 aBuell, C.

This is a challenging task, primarily as a result of the limitations of current analytical techniques to deal with heavy hydrocarbon samples. A different path toward this goal is through the use of hydrocarbon composition modeling techniques to derive the molecular make up of petroleum fractions with limited analytical data. The purpose of this study is to demonstrate this approach for simulating the molecular composition of vacuum distillates. The method consists of generating a computational mixture of representative hydrocarbon molecules that mimics the properties of an actual oil sample. Molecules are built according to the specific chemistry of vacuum distillates with a Monte Carlo algorithm, and the abundance of each molecule is optimized by entropy maximization. The model was applied to simulate two vacuum gas oil samples differing substantially in chemical composition and geographic origin. The samples were experimentally characterized in detail to obtain the necessary model inputs. Simulations revealed that the model adequately predicts the analytical properties and carbon number distributions of the two samples, proving its capability to capture a wide range of distinct vacuum distillate chemistries.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3aanalytical methods 3acarbon 3achemical composition 3adistillates 3aentropy 3aoils 3apetroleum 3aprovenance 3astatistical models1 aGieleciak, Rafal1 aChen, Jinwen0 tEnergy & Fuels.g2015 Dec. 17, v. 29, no. 12 p.7931-7940dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-50297nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.energyfuels.5b020823Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02719naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001600150245010500166520147900271592002801750650001101778650001601789650001801805650001701823650002601840650001201866650002301878650002501901650001601926653001601942653002901958653001501987653003502002700001302037700001502050700001602065700001602081700001602097773009002113856008502203852000902288655001202297IND60769463920221119193748.0220426e20220615xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076946392DNAL7 a10.1016/j.energy.2022.1236102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBian, Jiang10aHomogeneous nucleation and condensation mechanism of methane gas: A molecular simulation perspective  aLiquefied natural gas (LNG) occupies an increasing proportion in global natural gas industry. However, there is a lack of microscopic understanding of methane condensation mechanism. Furthermore, the accuracy of existing nucleation theories for alkane gases remains unclear. Herein, methane nucleation and growth pathways are elucidated and the influence mechanisms of initial conditions on nucleation thermodynamics and kinetics are analyzed using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. It is discovered that a system with a controlled carrier gas temperature is more consistent with the actual condensation process. For such a system, the heat transfer processes between monomers and clusters make the condensed molecules easier to vaporize and its nucleation and growth stages last longer. Besides, the condensation processes end earlier with higher nucleation rates and liquefaction degrees at high initial pressures and low cooling temperatures. Higher pressures lead to higher temperatures of monomers and clusters during nucleation, while avoiding secondary evaporation. Furthermore, as initial pressures and cooling temperatures increase, the effects of system quenching on pressure relieve, and the fall in pressure mainly depends on the liquefaction degree. Compared with Classical Nucleation Theory (CNT), Internally Consistent Classical Theory (ICCT) has higher accuracy for the nucleation calculation of methane under high-pressure and low-temperature conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aenergy 3aevaporation 3aheat transfer 3aliquefaction 3aliquefied natural gas 3amethane 3amolecular dynamics 3aoil and gas industry 3atemperature 0aNatural gas 0aHomogeneous condensation 0aNucleation 0aMolecular dynamics simulations1 aGuo, Dan1 aLi, Yuxuan1 aCai, Weihua1 aHua, Yihuai1 aCao, Xuewen0 tEnergy.g2022 June 15, v. 249 p.123610-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12436x0360-54427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2022.1236103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01184naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100001300138245011000151300001800261520021800279592002800497650002300525650001400548650000900562700002000571700001600591700001600607700002000623700001800643773012800661856007200789852000900861655001200870IND60657440420221121031559.0190816e20031003xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065744042DNAL7 a10.1039/b308007b2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHan, Lei12aA novel nonlinear optically active tubular coordination network based on two distinct homo-chiral helices  ap. 2580-2581.  aA novel tubular coordination network [Zn(spcp)(OH)] (spcp = 4-sulfanylmethyl-4′-phenylcarboxylate pyridine) with a modest SHG activity based on two types of homo-chiral helices was synthesized and characterized.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemical reactions 3apyridines 3azinc1 aHong, Mao-Chun,1 aWang, Ruihu1 aLuo, Junhua1 aLin, Zhengzhong1 aYuan, Daqiang0 tChemical communications.g2003 Oct. 3, , no. 20 p.2580-2581dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26910x1364-548X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/b308007b3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02634naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100002300142245019400165300001600359520155800375592002801933653002301961653001701984653002602001653002202027653002302049653001402072653001602086653001302102773011802115856007802233852000902311655001202320IND60124234620221123013219.0151025e201003  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012423462DNAL7 a10.4001/003.018.01112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKirk-Spriggs, A.H.12aA Revision of Afrotropical Quasimodo Flies (Diptera: Curtonotidae: Schizophora).

A diagnosis of the genus is provided and character states (synapomorphies) distinguishing the genus from other genera in the Curtonotidae are outlined. Four new species are described; and are illustrated using pen and ink drawings and light microscopy, namely T. amnoni Kirk-Spriggs, sp. n. (Malawi, Tanzania and Zambia), T. kinskii Kirk-Spriggs, sp. n. (Malawi), T. rhayaderi Kirk-Spriggs, sp. n. (Kenya and Malawi) and T. scoliosis Kirk-Spriggs, sp. n. (Tanzania); the first-named species being designated as type-species for the genus. An identification key to the four species is provided based on external characters. The distribution of the four species is mapped, indicating that T. rhayaderi sp. n. has a disjunct distribution on the Zomba Plateau (Malawi) and coastal forests of Kenya; T. kinskii sp. n. is apparently restricted to Ntchisi Forest (Malawi), and T. kinskii sp. n. to the Rebeho (Usagara) Mountains in the Eastern Arc group. Tigrisomyia amnoni sp. n. is more widely distributed occurring from the West Usambara Mountains in the north of Tanzania to the Zomba Plateau in the Shire District of southern Malawi (and some intervening relict forests). The historical biogeographical significance of the distribution of the four species is discussed in relation to historical pan-African forest cover in Africa.  aPublisher supplied data 0aAfromontane forest 0abiogeography 0aEastern Arc Mountains 0aGreat Rift Valley 0aidentification key 0anew genus 0anew species 0ataxonomy0 tAfrican entomology.g2010 Mar., v. 18, no. 1 p.127-146dEntomological Society of Southern Africax1021-35897nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.4001%2F003.018.01113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01517naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002000149245006700169500002200236520067400258592002800932653001400960653002500974653002500999653001101024700005701035773005501092856008301147852000901230655001201239IND60557842120221119202335.0161103s2016    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055784212DNAL7 a10.1016/j.softx.2016.07.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMulansky, Mario10aPySpike—A Python library for analyzing spike train synchrony  aPre-press version  aUnderstanding how the brain functions is one of the biggest challenges of our time.

The gas yields in terms of volatile solids (VS) loaded from Mix-2 and Mix-4 were compared with pure stand lucerne from the four cuts regime (Lu-4). The batch test results indicate that methane yield on a VS basis was highest from Mix-4 (295 L kg−1), followed by Mix-2 (281 L kg−1) and Lu-4 (255 L kg−1). The results were confirmed with continuous experiments, during which the reactor digesting Mix-4 was stable throughout the experiment with low ammonia and volatile fatty acid (VFA) concentration. Meanwhile, mono-digestion of Lu-4 led to elevated VFA levels, even at a comparatively low organic loading rate of 1.76 g L−1 d−1 but it was not possible to ascertain whether this was due to organic overload alone or if high ammonia levels during Lu-4 digestion were contributing to the reduced performance. It was found that four cuts per year was suitable for a lab-scale mono-digestion system as the substrate was less fibrous and has lower dry matter content, which minimize blockage during feeding and digestate unloading. Micronutrient concentrations, including cobalt, nickel and molybdenum decreased over time during the continuous experiments and were critically lower than the optimum concentration required by methanogens, particularly in Mix-4, but the gas yields of the reactor treating this substrate showed no decrease over time.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalfalfa 3aammonia 3abiogas 3acaraway 3achicory 3acobalt 3acutting frequency 3adigestion 3adry matter content 3aforbs 3agrasses 3amethane production 3amethanogens 3amolybdenum 3anickel 3avolatile fatty acids 0aMono-digestion 0aMultispecies 0aCutting frequency 0aMethane yield 0aNutrients1 aFeng, Lu1 aCong, Wen-Feng1 aWard, Alastair James1 aMøller, Henrik Bjarne1 aEriksen, Jørgen0 tBiomass and bioenergy.g2018 Feb., v. 109 p.199-208dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl3929140x0961-95347nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biombioe.2017.12.0293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02725naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100005600150245014300206520132900349592002801678650000801706650002001714650001101734650001301745650002001758650002001778650002401798650001501822650001101837653003501848653004101883653003801924653002101962700001701983700001502000700001602015700001402031700001702045700001402062700001902076773009002095856008502185852000902270655001202279IND60769464020221119193841.0220517e20220601xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076946402DNAL7 a10.1016/j.energy.2022.1236112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Huaiyu1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4322-101X10aComparison and evaluation of advanced machine learning methods for performance and emissions prediction of a gasoline Wankel rotary engine  aIn order to improve the performance, reduce the emissions and enhance the calibration efficiency of a gasoline Wankel rotary engine (WRE), three advanced machine learning (ML) methods, including artificial neural network (ANN), support vector machine (SVM), and Gaussian process regression (GPR), were applied to develop the prediction model of the torque, fuel flow, nitrogen oxide, carbon monoxide, and hydrocarbon. The effect of feature numbers was examined using the recommended parameters of the ANN, SVM, and GPR models. It was concluded that using speed, manifold absolute pressure, and air fuel ratio as input parameters to build the prediction model performed best. The generalization ability of the three ML models was compared on the interpolative and extrapolative data sets using the extended recommendation parameters. The results showed that the GPR model performed the best generalization ability in scarce data sets and was simpler to train compared with ANN and SVM. The response surfaces constructed using the GPR model were very smooth and accurate, in which the coefficient of determination for all the predicted parameters was more than 0.99. It is strongly proposed that the GPR approach is a universal approach which will be an essential direction for WRE system control and surrogate model modeling.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3acarbon monoxide 3aenergy 3agasoline 3aneural networks 3anitrogen oxides 3anormal distribution 3aprediction 3atorque 0aGasoline Wankel rotary engines 0aPerformance and emissions prediction 0aAdvanced machine learning methods 0aScarce data sets1 aJi, Changwei1 aShi, Cheng1 aGe, Yunshan1 aMeng, Hao1 aYang, Jinxin1 aChang, Ke1 aWang, Shuofeng0 tEnergy.g2022 June 01, v. 248 p.123611-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12436x0360-54427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2022.1236113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01525naa a2200253 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100005800149245010700207500002200314520065500336592002800991653000901019653002101028653002801049653003501077773005501112856008301167852000901250655001201259IND60557842220221119202247.0161103s2016    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055784222DNAL7 a10.1016/j.softx.2016.08.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEl-khoury, Jad1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0889-519010aLyo code generator: A model-based code generator for the development of OSLC-compliant tool interfaces  aPre-press version  aTo promote the newly emerging OSLC (Open Services for Lifecycle Collaboration) tool interoperability standard, an open source code generator is developed that allows for the specification of OSLC-compliant tool interfaces, and from which almost complete Java code of the interface can be generated.

In this paper, a methodology is developed to determine the best storm intensity parameter to derive storm thresholds for different morphological responses. The methodology is applied to the northern part of the Gulf of Lions coastline where storm events can induce important morphological changes. These include shoreline retreat, beach and dune erosion, significant migration of nearshore bars, overwashes and even breaches of coastal barriers, as well as damage to coastal defences and coastal infrastructure. In order to evaluate historical storm characteristics and impact, an extensive review was undertaken to obtain quantitative datasets (beach profiles, wave records), aerial photographs and more qualitative information on morphological evolution and coastal damage. Re-analysis of hydrodynamic and morphology data was undertaken, and hindcast wave modelling results were used to characterised storm intensities. The methodology developed to evaluate storm thresholds consists of obtaining morphological evolution indicators (evidence of breaching, overwash processes, volume variations and migration of morphological patterns) that can be directly linked to a storm event and its characteristics. Results demonstrate that in such a quasi-non-tidal wave-dominated environment, with intermediate double-barred beach shoreface morphology, major coastal changes occur following the maximum significant wave height reached during the storm, or else according to maximum wave run-up elevation regarding upper beach impact, a wave height dependant parameter. Inversely storm surge (and water level) alone, as well as total storm energy, do not explain any storm impact scale. Storm-specific datasets indicate that important morphological evolution is observed during moderate storm events (significant wave heights over 2.7m). Above this threshold, the morphological behaviour changes radically. The main characteristics are a rapid offshore migration of the nearshore bars and large deposition of sand on the upper beach. However, the major morphological changes are associated with even more energetic events. When the significant wave height reaches 5m, important impacts are observed: breaching and overtopping of natural coastal barriers, and severe dune erosion and impacts to coastal infrastructure on urbanised beaches. Qualitative observations show an important increase in damage when the storm waves reach 5m. The methods employed can be applied easily to any coastal segment and provide coastal managers with tools to evaluate different coastal evolution and coastal damage induced by storm events.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaerial photography 3abeaches 3abehavior change 3acoasts 3adata collection 3aenergy 3ahydrodynamics 3ainfrastructure 3amanagers 3amodels 3arisk 3asand 3ashorelines 3astorms 3aurbanization 3aFrance1 aBalouin, Y.1 aBelon, R.0 tGeomorphology.g2012 Mar. 15, v. 143-144 p.69-80dElsevier B.V.x0169-555X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.geomorph.2011.07.0353Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02551naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002300152245007700175300001300252520143600265592002801701650006701729650002301796650001201819650001301831650000801844650001001852650001201862650000901874650001201883651002101895651001001916700002101926700002001947700002001967773008301987856008602070852000902156655001202165IND60084280020221119182655.0141101e20120401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008428002DNAL7 a10.1016/j.geomorph.2011.08.0152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aThompson, Sarah S.12aA rapidly growing moraine-dammed glacial lake on Ngozumpa Glacier, Nepal  ap. 1-11.  aMoraine-dammed glacial lakes are becoming increasingly common in the Himalaya as a result of glacier mass loss, causing concern about glacier lake outburst flood risk. In addition to extant lakes, the potential exists for many more to form, as more glaciers ablate down to the level of potential moraine dams. In this paper, we document the recent rapid growth of, a moraine-dammed lake on Ngozumpa Glacier, Nepal. Using a combination of ground-based mapping and sonar surveys, aerial photographs (<1m resolution), and ASTER imagery (15m resolution), processes and rates of lake expansion have been determined. The lake first formed between 1984 and 1992 when collapse of an englacial conduit allowed water to accumulate at the level of a gap in the lateral moraine, ~km from the glacier terminus. Lake growth was initially slow, but since 2001 it has undergone exponential growth at an average rate of 10%y⁻¹. In 2009, the lake area was 300,000m², and its volume was at least 2.2million m³. Calving, subaqueous melting, and melting of subaerial ice faces all contribute to the expansion of the lake; but large-scale, full-height slab calving is now the dominant contributor to growth. Comparison with other lakes in the region indicate that lake growth will likely continue unchecked whilst the spillway remains at its current level and may attain a volume of hundreds of millions of cubic metres within the next few decades.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAdvanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer 3aaerial photography 3acalving 3aglaciers 3aice 3alakes 3amelting 3arisk 3asurveys 3aHimalayan region 3aNepal1 aBenn, Douglas I.1 aDennis, Kathryn1 aLuckman, Adrian0 tGeomorphology.g2012 Apr. 1, v. 145-146 p.1-11dElsevier B.V.x0169-555X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.geomorph.2011.08.0153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03422naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100003000151245007600181300001400257520148000271592002801751650002001779650001601799650001701815650001801832650002001850650001401870650001401884650002601898650002101924650001601945650002001961650001601981650001701997650004402014650001902058650001402077650003302091651001102124653001802135653001402153653003102167653004402198653003902242653003902281653001502320700002502335700002902360700002802389700003002417700003002447700003102477700002802508700006802536773010902604856008602713852000902799655001202808IND60634111520221120125124.0190516e201907  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063411152DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodres.2019.03.0252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFlorentino-Ramos, Elideth10a1H NMR-based fingerprinting of eleven Mexican Capsicum annuum cultivars  ap. 12-19.  aApproximately 90% of the chili peppers consumed in the world are harvested in Mexico. The present article describes the untargeted 1H NMR-based metabolomic profiling of 11 cultivars of Capsicum annuum species which are routinely consumed worldwide. The metabolomic fingerprinting detected via 1H NMR contained 44 metabolites including sugars, amino acids, organic acids, polyphenolic acids and alcohols which were identified by comparison with the literature data, with Chenomx database and by 2D NMR. Statistical approaches based on principal component analysis (PCA) and linear discriminant analysis (LDA) were used to classify the Capsicum annuum cultivars according to their metabolite profile. LDA revealed metabolomic differences and similarities among Capsicum annuum cultivars, whereas hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) significantly separated the cultivars according to the phylogenetic trees obtained. Substantial endogenous levels of free amino acids and carbohydrates were detected in all the studied cultivars but interestingly, Capsicum annuum cv. mirasol and C. annuum cv. chilaca contained almost three-fold more endogenous levels of vitamin C than the other cultivars. Considering that this antioxidant was found in crude aqueous extracts, its abundance could be directly proportional to its bioavailability for human nutrition. The results suggest that 1H NMR is an effective method to determine differences among cultivars of the Capsicum annuum species.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCapsicum annuum 3aamino acids 3aantioxidants 3aascorbic acid 3abioavailability 3acultivars 3adatabases 3adiscriminant analysis 3afree amino acids 3ahot peppers 3ahuman nutrition 3ametabolites 3ametabolomics 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aphenolic acids 3aphylogeny 3aprincipal component analysis 3aMexico 0aCapsicum spp. 0aCultivars 0aMetabolomic fingerprinting 0aNuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 0aPrincipal component analysis (PCA) 0aLinear discriminant analysis (LDA) 0aBiomarkers1 aVilla-Ruano, Nemesio1 aHidalgo-Martínez, Diego1 aRamírez-Meraz, Moisés1 aMéndez-Aguilar, Reinaldo1 aVelasquez Valle, Rodolfo,1 aZepeda-Vallejo, L.

It also reduces soil detachment by raindrops and the shear effect of water flow on the soil surface. In arid and semiarid ecosystems, biological soil crusts (BSCs) commonly appear in clearings between plants. Depending on the dominant component in the BSC community, the roughness of the soil surface may vary considerably, changing the hydrologic and erosive response of the soil. The aim of this study is to determine the effect of physical and biological crusts on soil surface roughness and their influence on runoff and erosion. For this purpose, we set up open plots containing different BSC types and treatments and recorded runoff and total erosion from all the events for 18months. Micro-topographic indexes were calculated from high-resolution digital surface models of the plots built from terrestrial laser scanner height data. After comparing different spatial resolutions and indexes, we concluded that only the local Random Roughness index in a 40-mm moving window provided a precise estimation of the roughness induced by BSCs, though it did not have a direct effect on runoff response. The best relationship between microtopography and runoff on biologically crusted soils was found for surface storage capacity, which appears as a powerful predictor of the runoff coefficient on long temporal scales. Sediment yield was not well predicted by any of the micro-topographic indexes studied. The only index that was significantly related to sediment yield was the local Random Roughness in a 40mm moving window, but even this explained only a third of the erosion variance.  aPublisher supplied data 3aecosystems 3amicrorelief 3amodels 3aroughness 3arunoff 3asediment yield 3asoil crusts 3asurface roughness 3asurface storage 3avariance 3awater flow1 aCantón, Yolanda1 aChamizo, Sonia1 aAfana, Ashraf1 aSolé-Benet, Albert0 tGeomorphology.g2012 Apr. 1, v. 145-146 p.81-89dElsevier B.V.x0169-555X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.geomorph.2011.12.0423Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02346naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245016000169300001800329520117000347592002801517650003801545650002101583650001201604650001901616650001301635650001601648650003201664700001901696700001501715700002001730700001701750700001701767773010501784856008601889852000901975655001201984IND60578236520221117030307.0170812e20161011xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057823652DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.macromol.6b015242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHou, Ping-Ping10aHierarchical Structures in a Main-Chain/Side-Chain Combined Liquid Crystalline Polymer with a Polynorbornene Backbone and Multi-Benzene Side-Chain Mesogens  ap. 7238-7245.  aA series of main-chain/side-chain combined liquid crystalline polymers (MCSCLCPs) with a polynorbornene backbone and multi-benzene mesogens in the side chain, PNbnPP (n = 2, 6, 10), were synthesized through a controllable polymerization method: ring-opening metathesis polymerization (ROMP). Differential scanning calorimetry, polarized light microscopy, and one-/two-dimensional wide-angle X-ray diffraction were utilized to investigate the phase behavior of PNbnPP. Experimental results reveal that the two fundamentally different liquid crystalline (LC) building blocksthe mesogen-jacketed LC polymer main chain and the multi-benzene calamitic mesogens in the side chaincompete and promote with each other, leading to a complex phase behavior. Because of the coupling effect between the rigid core and the pendants (multi-benzene mesogens) of PNb2PP with a short spacer, PNb2PP forms a simple smectic phase. On the other hand, owing to the decoupling effect of the long spacers, at low temperatures PNb6PP and PNb10PP form hierarchical structures, including the smectic phase of the polymer as a whole and the ordered packing of the multi-benzene mesogens.  aPublisher supplied data 3adifferential scanning calorimetry 3alight microscopy 3aliquids 3apolymerization 3apolymers 3atemperature 3awide-angle X-ray scattering1 aZhang, Zhen-Yu1 aWang, Qian1 aZhang, Meng-Yao1 aShen, Zhihao1 aFan, Xing-He0 tMacromolecules.g2016 Oct. 11, v. 49, no. 19 p.7238-7245dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-58357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.macromol.6b015243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02673naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002100153245013500174300001800309520144400327592002801771650001201799650001901811650001501830650001301845650001901858650001001877650001001887650001801897650001301915650001101928650001501939650002201954650001601976700002701992700001602019700002502035773010502060856008902165852000902254655001202263IND60534224020221119004558.0160802e20151217xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053422402DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.energyfuels.5b020972doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRafati, Mohammad10aSequential Modular Simulation of Hydrodynamics and Reaction Kinetics in a Biomass Bubbling Fluidized-Bed Gasifier Using Aspen Plus  ap. 8261-8272.  aA sequential modular simulation (SMS) approach was used to simulate hydrodynamics and detailed kinetics of a fluidized-bed biomass gasifier in Aspen Plus. The kinetics of tar cracking reactions was taken into account in the simulation. The effects of operating conditions including temperature, equivalence ratio (ER), and steam-to-biomass ratio (SBR) on the composition and the lower heating value (LHV) of the effluent gas were studied and compared with experimental data. The model predictions well agreed with the experimental data. The increase of the bed temperature significantly decreased the tar content and increased the hydrogen content of the product gas. At ER = 0.3, the increase of the temperature from 973 K to 1123 K resulted in the increase of H₂ molar concentration in the product gas from 7.6% to 11.3% and CO molar concentration from 13.1% to 17.0%. At a temperature of 1073 K, the optimum ER value was 0.3 and the increase in ER from 0.2 to up to 0.3 increased the amount of fuel gases but further increases in ER shifted the system kinetics toward the combustion regime. At 1073 K and ER = 0.3, with an increase in SBR from 0 to 1.0, H₂ and CO₂ concentrations increased from 9.3% and 13.3% to 10.8% and 14.7%, respectively, and CO concentration decreased from 15.8% to 12.9%. The analysis showed the SMS model with four stages gives the most satisfactory predictions, via comparison with the experimental data.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiomass 3acarbon dioxide 3acombustion 3acracking 3afluidized beds 3afuels 3agases 3ahydrodynamics 3ahydrogen 3amodels 3aprediction 3areaction kinetics 3atemperature1 aHashemisohi, Abolhasan1 aWang, Lijun1 aShahbazi, Abolghasem0 tEnergy & Fuels.g2015 Dec. 17, v. 29, no. 12 p.8261-8272dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-50297nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.energyfuels.5b020973Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02878naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001500150245016600165520143400331592002801765650001101793650001901804650001701823650002101840650001101861650002001872650000901892650001101901651001001912653001701922653002101939653002301960653002201983653003502005653003302040700005202073700001202125700005502137700001502192700001502207700001402222773009002236856008502326852000902411655001202420IND60769464220221119193748.0220517e20220601xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076946422DNAL7 a10.1016/j.energy.2022.1236152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, G.Y.12aA two-phase factorial input-output model for analyzing CO2-emission reduction pathway and strategy from multiple perspectives – A case study of Fujian province  aIn this study, a two-phase factorial input-output model (TFIOM) is developed for carbon dioxide (CO₂) emission mitigation, through integrating input-output model (IOM) and two-phase factorial analysis (TFA) into a general framework. TFIOM can identify the main sectors of CO₂ emission, quantify the individual and interactive effects of the main factors (i.e. various CO₂ management strategies implemented on different sectors) on reduction target, as well as seek CO₂-emission reduction pathways and strategies from multiple perspectives (i.e. energy structure adjustment strategy (ESAS), technology upgrade strategy (TUS), and industrial structure adjustment strategy (ISAS)). The developed TFIOM is applied to Fujian province (in China), and results reveal that industries of chemical, non-metallic, metal smelting (MSI), and electric heating (EGW) are the main CO₂-emission sectors (i.e. occupying 57.6% of direct emission and 56.4% of indirect emission). The joint application of ESAS (applied to EGW) and TUS (applied to MSI) has the best effect in reducing carbon emission intensity (decreasing by 24.5%). Among all scenarios, Scenario 115 shows the most desirable emission-reduction effect (i.e. carbon emission intensity, energy intensity, total direct emission, and total indirect emission would respectively decrease by 22.3%, 7.6%, 21.3% and 5.1%, and the cost of reducing CO₂ per ton would be 182 RMB¥).  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon 3acarbon dioxide 3acase studies 3aemissions factor 3aenergy 3afactor analysis 3aheat 3amodels 3aChina 0aCO2 emission 0aEnergy structure 0aInput-output model 0aMulti-perspective 0aReduction pathway and strategy 0aTwo-phase factorial analysis1 aLi, Y.P.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9322-28541 aLiu, J.1 aHuang, G.H.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4974-30191 aChen, L.R.1 aYang, Y.J.1 aGao, P.P.0 tEnergy.g2022 June 01, v. 248 p.123615-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12436x0360-54427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2022.1236153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03333naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245010700169300001600276520142600292592002801718650004401746650002201790650001401812650001201826650001801838650002301856650001301879650002601892650001701918650001401935650003701949650002001986650002002006650001802026650001802044650002402062650001502086650003302101650001602134650002402150650003702174650001402211650002102225650001102246653001402257653002502271653002102296653002702317653001702344653001602361700002702377700006102404700003002465700001902495773009902514856008502613852000902698655001202707IND60685228020221118102214.0201202e20200315xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068522802DNAL7 a10.1016/j.wasman.2020.02.0322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aForoutan, Rauf10aTransesterification of waste edible oils to biodiesel using calcium oxide@magnesium oxide nanocatalyst  ap. 373-383.  aIn the present research, application of waste edible oil (WEO) as a suitable and abundant source for biodiesel production using CaO@MgO nanocatalyst derived from waste chicken eggshells was studied. To this end, FT-IR, XRD, SEM, EDX, Map, and TEM analyses were performed to investigate characteristics of the CaO@MgO nanocatalyst. Also, the physical properties of the biodiesel such as flash point, kinematic viscosity, density, distillation point, cloud point, pour point, cetane number, oxidation stability, and acid number were determined according to the international standards. In addition, FT-IR and HNMR analyses were used to determine the biodiesel characteristics. Moreover, the produced catalyst was successively reused for up to 6 cycles and the results showed that the catalytic activity of the catalyst produced was sufficient for biodiesel production from WEO for up to three cycles, beyond which its catalytic activity decreased. The present work further considered the effects of different parameters on biodiesel production using central composite design to determine optimal conditions. According to the results, the highest biodiesel conversion yield (98.37%) was achieved in a reaction time of 7.08 h, reaction temperature of 69.37 °C, methanol-to-oil ratio of 16.7:1, and catalyst concentration of 4.571 wt% which shows the highest biodiesel conversion yield ever achieved from waste edible oil.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aX-ray diffraction 3abiodiesel 3acalcium 3acalcium oxide 3acatalytic activity 3achickens 3acooking fats and oils 3adistillation 3aegg shell 3aenergy-dispersive X-ray analysis 3afuel production 3amagnesium oxide 3ananocatalysts 3ananomaterials 3aoxidative stability 3apour point 3ascanning electron microscopy 3atemperature 3atransesterification 3atransmission electron microscopy 3aviscosity 3awaste management 3awastes 0aBiodiesel 0aCaO@MgO nanocatalyst 0aWaste edible oil 0aWaste chicken eggshell 0aOptimization 0aCalcination1 aMuḥammadī, Riz̤ā,1 aEsmaeili, Hossein1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3417-84401 aMirzaee Bektashi, Fatemeh1 aTamjidi, Sajad0 tWaste management.g2020 Mar. 15, v. 105 p.373-383dElsevier LtdwJournal:6325x0956-053X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2020.02.0323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03173naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002100152245009500173300001500268520196400283592002802247650001102275650001402286650001602300650001102316650001202327650001402339650001302353650002202366650001502388651001002403700002502413700003802438700002702476700003202503700002802535700002002563773008502583856008602668852000902754655001202763IND60084280220221119182518.0141101e20120401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008428022DNAL7 a10.1016/j.geomorph.2011.12.0432doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGiaconia, Flavio10aGeomorphic evidence of active tectonics in the Sierra Alhamilla (eastern Betics, SE Spain)  ap. 90-106.  aActive tectonic deformation influencing the streams and hillslopes of the Sierra Alhamilla ridge (anticlinorium) in southeast Spain is related to the dextral-reverse Polopos Fault Zone to the north and east of the ridge and to normal faulting in the southern side of the ridge. A fault segmentation and fluvial terrace mapping is presented in this paper. The following geomorphic indices were calculated in the area: the mountain-front sinuosity, valley floor width-to-height ratio, drainage basin asymmetry factor, basin hypsometric curve and integral, longitudinal river profile and stream-length gradient index normalized by the graded river gradient (SLk index). The SLk map shows two sets of high anomalies: a) an E–W-striking anomaly, due to the dextral-reverse Polopos Fault Zone located in the northern limb of the anticlinorium; b) a group of NNW–SSE-striking anomalies, associated with Pliocene–Quaternary NW–SE- to NNW–SSE-striking high-angle normal faults that cut the southern limb. Late Pleistocene–Holocene activity occurred along the North Alhamilla Reverse Fault and the dextral transpressive South Gafarillos Fault, two segments in the Polopos Fault Zone. The former fault produces rejuvenation of the streams at the base of the northern slope. In this area, mountain-front sinuosity and valley floor width-to-height ratio suggest Quaternary uplift rates between 0.05 and 0.5mky⁻¹. Holocene to present-day activity of the South Gafarillos Fault is demonstrated by faulted late Pleistocene terraces and Holocene colluvial deposits and suggested by deflected streams that have complex or convex hypsometric curves. Pliocene–Quaternary high-angle normal faults control the relief in the southern limb and the western end of the Sierra Alhamilla. These faults produce low mountain-front sinuosity and valley floor width-to-height ratio indices typical of uplift rates quite higher than field-based rates from some other studies.  aPublisher supplied data 3abasins 3acolluvium 3adeformation 3arivers 3astreams 3atectonics 3aterraces 3atopographic slope 3awatersheds 3aSpain1 aBooth-Rea, Guillermo1 aMartínez-Martínez, José Miguel1 aAzañón, José Miguel1 aPérez-Peña, José Vicente1 aPérez-Romero, Joaquín1 aVillegas, Irene0 tGeomorphology.g2012 Apr. 1, v. 145-146 p.90-106dElsevier B.V.x0169-555X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.geomorph.2011.12.0433Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02851naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001600150245016200166520130700328592002801635650002901663650001101692650001901703650001701722650001101739650001201750650001101762650002001773650002901793650001601822653002001838653002401858653003001882653002701912700001701939700001401956700005901970700001602029700001702045700001702062700001402079700001702093700001302110700001802123700002002141773009002161856008502251852000902336655001202345IND60769464320221119193752.0220517e20220601xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076946432DNAL7 a10.1016/j.energy.2022.1236162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGao, Ruxing10aEfficient production of renewable hydrocarbon fuels using waste CO2 and green H2 by integrating Fe-based Fischer-Tropsch synthesis and olefin oligomerization  aRecently, Power-to-Liquids (PtL) and Power-to-Gas (PtG) technologies have been regarded as promising pathways for renewable energy storage and CO₂ mitigation. Herein, we newly proposed two PtL/PtG hybrid processes (Cases A and B) by integrating the Fe-based Fischer-Tropsch (F-T) synthesis and olefin oligomerization, to further enhance the production of value-added liquid hydrocarbons. The process modelling and case study were implemented to evaluate their process performances by using Aspen Plus. In addition, the effects of different feeding conditions (i.e., CO/CO₂ feeding) and process configurations (i.e., F-T synthesis only or two-stage reactor) were also comparatively analyzed. It is found that both Cases A and B are efficient technologies for converting CO₂ into value-added hydrocarbons, and Case A is found to be more beneficial in the aspects of the carbon and thermal efficiencies, and net CO₂ reduction. While, Case B is competitive in producing high-value liquid hydrocarbons. Moreover, the options of CO₂ feeding and two-stage reactor are more preferable than the options of CO feeding and F-T synthesis only, and both Cases A and B are more competitive in the aspects of syncrude production, thermal efficiency, and CO₂ reduction, as compared to the Base cases 1–3.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFischer-Tropsch reaction 3acarbon 3acarbon dioxide 3acase studies 3aenergy 3aliquids 3aolefin 3aoligomerization 3arenewable energy sources 3avalue added 0aCO2 utilization 0aProcess integration 0aFischer-tropsch synthesis 0aOlefin oligomerization1 aZhang, Leiyu1 aWang, Lei1 aZhang, Chundong1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4277-86141 aJun, Ki-Won1 aKim, Seok Ki1 aPark, Hae-Gu1 aGao, Ying1 aZhu, Yuezhao1 aWan, Hui1 aGuan, Guofeng1 aZhao, Tiansheng0 tEnergy.g2022 June 01, v. 248 p.123616-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12436x0360-54427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2022.1236163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03072naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002200150245012700172300001600299520154700315592002801862650002701890650001901917650002401936650001101960650002001971650002601991650001002017650001102027650001802038650003302056650001402089650001802103653001402121653002302135653002602158653002002184700002502204700002402229700001902253700002302272700006302295700002302358773011502381856008502496852000902581655001202590IND60543881520221118021212.0190412e201508  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054388152DNAL7 a10.1016/j.meegid.2015.06.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCavallero, Serena10aGenetic heterogeneity and phylogeny of Trichuris spp. from captive non-human primates based on ribosomal DNA sequence data  ap. 450-456.  aNematodes of the genus Trichuris, known as whipworms, are recognized to infect numerous mammalian species including humans and non-human primates. Several Trichuris spp. have been described and species designation/identification is traditionally based on host-affiliation, although cross-infection and hybridization events may complicate species boundaries. The main aims of the present study were to genetically characterize adult Trichuris specimens from captive Japanese macaques (Macaca fuscata) and grivets (Chlorocebus aethiops), using the ribosomal DNA (ITS) as molecular marker and to investigate the phylogeny and the extent of genetic variation also by comparison with data on isolates from other humans, non-human primates and other hosts. The phylogenetic analysis of Trichuris sequences from M. fuscata and C. aethiops provided evidences of distinct clades and subclades thus advocating the existence of additional separated taxa. Neighbor Joining and Bayesian trees suggest that specimens from M. fuscata may be distinct from, but related to Trichuris trichiura, while a close relationship is suggested between the subclade formed by the specimens from C. aethiops and the subclade formed by T. suis.The tendency to associate Trichuris sp. to host species can lead to misleading taxonomic interpretations (i.e. whipworms found in primates are identified as T. trichiura). The results here obtained confirm previous evidences suggesting the existence of Trichuris spp. other than T. trichiura infecting non-human living primates.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCercopithecus aethiops 3aMacaca fuscata 3aTrichuris trichiura 3aadults 3across infection 3agenetic heterogeneity 3ahosts 3ahumans 3ahybridization 3ainternal transcribed spacers 3aphylogeny 3aribosomal DNA 0aTrichuris 0aNon-human primates 0aNuclear ribosomal DNA 0aSpecies complex1 aDe Liberato, Claudio1 aFriedrich, Klaus G.1 aDi Cave, David1 aMasella, Valentina1 aD’Amelio, Stefano1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1871-95531 aBerrilli, Federica0 tInfection, genetics, and evolution.g2015 Aug., v. 34 p.450-456dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12450x1567-13487nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.meegid.2015.06.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02357naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002100146245007800167520133700245592002801582650001301610650001301623650003701636650001101673650001801684650001101702650002001713650001001733700002101743700002001764700002501784773012101809856008001930852000902010655001202019IND60742416920221119232449.0210624e20210521xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074241692DNAL7 a10.3390/agronomy110610222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPlavšin, Ivana 10aCapturing GEI Patterns for Quality Traits in Biparental Wheat Populations  aGenotype-by-environment interaction (GEI) is often a great challenge for breeders since it makes the selection of stable or superior genotypes more difficult. In order to reduce drawbacks caused by GEI and make the selection for wheat quality more effective, it is important to properly assess the effects of genotype, environment, and GEI on the trait of interest. In the present study, GEI patterns for the selected quality and mixograph traits were studied using the Additive Main Effects and Multiplicative Interaction (AMMI) model. Two biparental wheat populations consisting of 145 and 175 RILs were evaluated in six environments. The environment was the dominant source of variation for grain protein content (GPC), wet gluten content (WGC), and test weight (TW), accounting for approximately 40% to 85% of the total variation. The pattern was less consistent for mixograph traits for which the dominant source of variation has been shown to be trait and population-dependent. Overall, GEI has been shown to play a more important role for mixograph traits compared to other quality traits. Inspection of the AMMI2 biplot revealed some broadly adapted RILs, among which, MG124 is the most interesting, being the prevalent “winner” for GPC and WGC, but also the “winner” for non-correlated trait TW in environment SB10.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagronomy 3agenotype 3agenotype-environment interaction 3agluten 3agrain protein 3amodels 3aprotein content 3awheat1 aGunjača, Jerko 1 aŠimek, Ruđer 1 aNovoselović, Dario 0 tAgronomy.g2021 May 21, v. 11, no. 6dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:12361x2073-43957nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agronomy110610223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02874naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002300150245010700173300001600280520166400296592002801960650001901988650001702007650002102024650001102045650001402056650002402070650001302094650001402107653002802121653002402149653002502173653002102198653001902219653002202238700002302260773009902283856008502382852000902467655001202476IND60685228220221118102208.0201202e20200315xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068522822DNAL7 a10.1016/j.wasman.2020.02.0342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRoithner, Caroline10aImplementing the dimension of quality into the conventional quantitative definition of recycling rates  ap. 586-593.  aWith the proposed Circular Economy Package, the European Union is striving to play a leading role in the implementation of recycling goals. The significantly increased recycling targets are just some of the defined objectives. However, to assess the Member States’ attainment of the new recycling targets, the European Union still builds on a purely quantitative recycling rate assessment procedure that neglects to include qualitative recycling aspects. This circumstance could lead to additional quality losses in recycling processes because recyclers might tend to focus exclusively on higher quantities to achieve the stricter recycling targets on time. To prevent such a development, the aim of this study is to establish a complementary recycling indicator that combines quantitative and qualitative recycling aspects in one single metric. The basis of this assessment method is the statistical entropy approach, which enables the concentrating or diluting effect of a recycling process brought about through the separation or mixing of materials to be measured. The results of the statistical entropy metric will provide greater insight into recycling processes (or systems) and thereby yield enhanced information on the quantity and purity of recycling outputs. The simple structure of the new approach will allow enhanced comparisons between technologies as well as national recycling performance. A case study on plastic packaging recycling demonstrates that the new recycling indicator provides multifaceted findings relative to the hitherto purely quantitative recycling assessment data, hence enriching conclusions on the recycling performance.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEuropean Union 3acase studies 3acircular economy 3amixing 3apackaging 3apackaging materials 3aplastics 3arecycling 0aRecycling effectiveness 0aStatistical entropy 0aRecycling assessment 0aCircular economy 0aRecycling rate 0aPlastic packaging1 aRechberger, Helmut0 tWaste management.g2020 Mar. 15, v. 105 p.586-593dElsevier LtdwJournal:6325x0956-053X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2020.02.0343Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03031naa a2200721 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001300152245014000165300001400305520115500319592002801474650002201502650001301524650001201537650001601549650001601565650001501581650001801596650001101614650003101625650002101656650001401677650001001691650001101701650002801712650001201740653001701752653002101769653002101790653003101811653001001842653001101852653000801863653001101871653000801882653000801890653000801898653000801906653001101914653001001925653000801935653000801943653000801951653000701959653000701966653000801973653000801981700001401989700001302003700001702016700001702033700001702050700001702067700001202084773010502096856008702201852000902288655001202297IND60591226920221119205635.0190410e201804  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059122692DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biombioe.2018.01.0172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Zhan10aIdentification of oil, sugar and crude fiber during tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum L.) seed development based on near infrared spectroscopy  ap. 39-45.  aTobacco seeds are a potential feedstock for biofuels. To insure make full use of tobacco seed biomass, the present study was carried out to estimate seed oil, sugar and crude fiber during seed development through near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) nondestructive determination. Four pre-processing methods, Savitzky-Goly after standard normal variate (SNV-SG), first Savitzky-Goly derivative after standard normal variate (SNV-SG-1stD), Savitzky-Goly after multiplicative scatter correction (MSC-SG) and first Savitzky-Goly derivative after multiplicative scatter correction (MSC-SG-1stD), were respectively performed to optimize the original spectra before establishment of the calibration models. Then linear partial least squares (PLS) and nonlinear least-squares support vector machine (LS-SVM) methods were utilized to develop the calibration models, in which the LS-SVM models were found to have better performance than PLS models. The best LS-SVM models of oil, sugar and crude fiber were established after pre-processed by MSC-SG-1st D.

We investigated the effects of single-locus and multilocus interactions to test the hypothesis that the members of the GPCR family genes, adenosine A2a receptor (ADORA2A) and G-protein coupled receptor kinase5 (GRK5), may contribute to the pathogenesis of malaria caused by Plasmodium falciparum (Pf) independently or through complex interactions. In a case–control study of adults, individuals affected by Pf malaria (complicated n=168; uncomplicated n=282) and healthy controls (n=450) were tested for their association to four known SNPs in GRK5 (rs2230345, rs2275036, rs4752307 and rs11198918) and two in ADORA2A (rs9624472 and rs5751876) genes with malaria susceptibility, using techniques of polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphisms and direct DNA sequencing. Single-locus analysis showed significant association of 2 SNPs; rs5751876 (OR=3.2(2.0–5.2); p=0.0006) of ADORA2A and rs2230345 (OR=0.3(0.2–0.5); p=0.0006) of GRK5 with malaria. The mean of the serum creatinine levels were significantly higher in patients with variant GG (p=0.006) of rs9624472 in ADORA2A gene compared to AA and AG genotypes in complicated Pf malaria cases, with the G allele also showing increased risk for malaria (OR=1.3(1.1–1.6); p=0.017). Analyses of predicted haplotypes of the two ADORA2A and the four GRK5 SNPs have identified the haplotypes that conferred risk as well as resistance to malaria with statistical significance. Molecular docking analysis of evolutionary rs2230345 SNP indicated a stable activity of GRK5 for the mutant allele compared to the wild type. Further, generalized multifactor dimensionality reduction to test the contribution of individual effects of the six polymorphisms and higher-order interactions to risk of symptoms/clinical complications of malaria suggested a best six-locus model showing statistical significance. The study provides evidence for the role of ADORA2A and GRK5 that might influence the etiology of malaria infection.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPlasmodium falciparum 3aadults 3aalleles 3ablood serum 3acase-control studies 3acreatinine 3aerythrocytes 3aetiology 3agenetic variation 3ahaplotypes 3amalaria 3amolecular models 3amutants 3aparasites 3apathogenesis 3apatients 3apolymerase chain reaction 3apurinergic receptors 3arisk 3asequence analysis 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism 0aMalaria 0aSNPs 0aAssociation 0aGRK5 0aADORA2A 0aGene interaction1 aJain, Aditya1 aSaadi, Abdul Vahab1 aVasudevan, Thanvanthri G.1 aHande, Manjunath H.1 aD’Souza, Sydney C.1 aGhosh, Susanta K.1 aUmakanth, Shashikiran1 aSatyamoorthy, Kapaettu0 tInfection, genetics, and evolution.g2015 Aug., v. 34 p.188-199dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12450x1567-13487nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.meegid.2015.06.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03991naa a2200757 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024004700113040001800160100001800178245009700196300001600293520166500309592002801974650001802002650001602020650001502036650002002051650001602071650002802087650001802115650001902133650001902152650001802171650002602189650001302215650001302228650001702241650001202258650001002270650000902280650002202289650002302311650002502334650002802359650002502387650008702412650004502499650002402544650003302568650001102601650001102612650003402623650002602657650000902683650001602692650003802708650002802746650002502774650002602799650004202825651001102867700002702878700002302905700001902928700002002947700001602967700001702983773009603000856009303096990002303189852000903212655001203221IND60088912920221121031948.0141102e201206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008891292DNAL7 a225757082pmid7 a10.1016/j.atherosclerosis.2012.03.0162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGeorge, Jacob10aRegulatory T cells and IL-10 levels are reduced in patients with vulnerable coronary plaques  ap. 519-523.  aBACKGROUND: Despite having a similar large extent of atherosclerotic coronary affliction, some patients suffer of recurrent cardiac events, whereas others remain asymptomatic. HYPOTHESIS: We hypothesized the existence of a systemic “signature” that could distinguish “vulnerable” patients with preexisting coronary atherosclerosis from those having similar risk factors and atheromatous burden, but no history of clinically evident plaque rupture/erosion. METHODS: Twenty three patients who had at least two prior myocardial infarctions (“vulnerable group”) were matched in respect to their background and coronary atherosclerosis extent with twenty one patients without a history of previous myocardial infarction who underwent routine coronary angiography before valvular surgery. We studied a panel of cytokines, antibodies and hormones including IL-6, IL-10, IL-12, antibodies to β2 glycoprotein I (β2GPI), antibodies to oxidized-LDL, adiponectin and resistin, along with levels of circulating EPCs and Tregs. RESULTS: A significantly higher level of Treg cells was present in the control (73.4%±4) than in the “vulnerable patient” group (62.2%±10.7), p<0.001. IL-10 level was also significantly higher in the control than in the vulnerable patients (2.6±1.2pg/ml versus 0.9±0.1pg/ml respectively, p=0.03). There was no significant difference in the circulating levels of the other cytokines, hormones or EPCs between the two groups. CONCLUSION: Regulatory T cells and serum IL-10 may discriminate “vulnerable” versus stable patients and may have a protective role against plaque rupture in patients with coronary atherosclerosis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aT-lymphocytes 3aadiponectin 3aantibodies 3aatherosclerosis 3ablood serum 3acoronary artery disease 3aglycoproteins 3ainterleukin-10 3ainterleukin-12 3ainterleukin-6 3amyocardial infarction 3apatients 3aresistin 3arisk factors 3asurgery 2aAdult 2aAged 2aAged, 80 and over 2aBiomarkersxblood. 2aCase-Control Studies 2aChi-Square Distribution 2aCoronary Angiography 2aCoronary Artery Diseasexbloodxcomplicationsximmunologyxpathologyxradiography. 2aCoronary Vesselsximmunologyxpathology. 2aDisease Progression 2aEndothelial Cellsxpathology 2aFemale 2aHumans 2aInflammation Mediatorsxblood 2aInterleukin-10xblood 2aMale 2aMiddle Aged 2aMyocardial Infarctionximmunology 2aPlaque, Atherosclerotic 2aRupture, Spontaneous 2aStem Cellsxpathology 2aT-Lymphocytes, Regulatoryximmunology 0aIsrael1 aSchwartzenberg, Shmuel1 aMedvedovsky, Diego1 aJonas, Michael1 aCharach, Gideon1 aAfek, Arnon1 aShamiss, Ari0 tAtherosclerosis.g2012 June, v. 222, no. 2 p.519-523dElsevier Ireland Ltdx0021-91507nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.atherosclerosis.2012.03.0163Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03236naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100005600142245008800198500002000286520150600306592002801812596005301840596005101893596006701944596006602011650001202077650001802089650001502107650001502122650001302137650000902150650001102159650000902170650001302179650001302192650001202205650001302217650001202230650001102242651001402253700005702267700007202324700005902396700006502455773013602520856007702656852000902733655001202742IND60789818920221121070930.0220822e202107  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078981892DNAL7 a10.1029/2021JC0172242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuhn, Oliver1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3626-913510aSubmarine Meltwater From Nioghalvfjerdsbræ (79 North Glacier), Northeast Greenland  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe Greenland Ice Sheet (GrIS) faces accelerated melting under a warming climate. This also affects the largest marine‐terminating outlet glacier of the Northeast Greenland Ice Stream (NEGIS), the Nioghalvfjerdsbræ (79 North Glacier, 79NG). In the cavity below its floating ice tongue, the heat of inflowing warm and saline Atlantic Water melts the ice at the base, and colder and fresher outflow is exported toward the shelf break and presumably south with the East Greenland Current (EGC). However, freshwater from submarine melting is hardly distinguishable from other freshwater sources by salinity alone. To identify and to quantify the distribution of submarine meltwater on the Northeast Greenland Shelf, we use helium (He) and neon (Ne) observations obtained directly at the calving front of the 79NG, on the Northeast Greenland Shelf, and in Fram Strait during an expedition aboard R/V POLARSTERN in summer 2016. These tracers uniquely identify submarine meltwater (SMW) and allow quantifying its fraction. SMW is present on the shelf but dilutes from 1.8% at the 79NG calving front to nonsignificant in Fram Strait. The SMW formation rate of the 79NG was estimated to be 14.5 ± 2.3 Gt per year. A surplus of Ne compared to He in the upper 100 dbar observed on most of the shelf region is attributed to noble gas fractionation during sea ice formation. Combining the Ne excess with the ventilation time on the shelf of 1.5 years yields a mean sea ice formation rate of 4 m per year.  aPublisher supplied data  aHU 1544/7cDeutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG)  aRH25/43cDeutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG)  a0F3F0778DcBundesministerium für Bildung und Forschung (BMBF)  a03F0778AcBundesministerium für Bildung und Forschung (BMBF) 3aclimate 3afractionation 3afreshwater 3ageophysics 3aglaciers 3aheat 3ahelium 3aneon 3aresearch 3asalinity 3asea ice 3asnowmelt 3astreams 3asummer 3aGreenland1 aRhein, Monika1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1496-28281 aKanzow, T.

However, decreased ground water allocations have necessitated determining the impact of limited irrigation on canola productivity. The objectives of this research were to determine the effects of a range of irrigation from none to fully irrigated on yield, oil content, soil water changes and water productivity of spring canola. The study was conducted for four growing seasons at three locations in western Nebraska. Two sites had sandy soils whereas the other was a silt loam. Glyphosate tolerant canola was planted late March to early April. Cumulative irrigation treatments were 0, 100, 200, and 300mm of water with the highest rate adjusted to be non-ET limiting. Canola extracted soil water from depths greater than 1.2m in both fine textured and sandy soils making it a good alternative for deficit irrigation. Canola responded well to irrigation during dry years but showed little response in above average precipitation years. A water use efficiency of 7.6kgmm−1 with a threshold of 123mm was observed. Canola seed yield ranged from 440 to 3280kgha−1 with 165 and 582mm of cumulative ET. During drier years, canola exhibited peak values in water use at 8–9 weeks after planting. Deficit irrigation reduced ET and yield and hastened maturity during drier years. Oil content was increased by irrigation during drier years with no effect shown when precipitation was above average. Oil content ranged from 30 to 50% depending on year and irrigation level. The water response provided benefits of not only higher yield, but also higher oil content which makes deficit irrigated canola an attractive alternative production and biofuel crop for this region.  aPublisher supplied data  cRisk Management Agencydhttps://doi.org/10.13039/1000091760 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aBrassica napus 3acanola 3adeficit irrigation 3aenergy crops 3aglyphosate 3agrowing season 3aherbicide resistance 3airrigation rates 3alipid content 3aoilseed crops 3aplanting date 3asandy soils 3aseed yield 3asilt 3asoil water 3awater use efficiency 3aNebraska 0aBiodiesel 0aOilseed crops 0aHigh Plains aquifer 0aGround water decline1 aMargheim, J.F.1 aPavlista, A.D.1 aMartin, D.L.1 aSupalla, R.J.1 aIsbell, T.A.0 tAgricultural water management.g2016 Apr., v. 168 p.96-103dElsevier B.V.aElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl8460x0378-37747nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agwat.2016.02.0033Available from publisher's site  aARIS submissionbhttp://submit.nal.usda.gov/system/files/submissions/10966.pdf  aUSDA/ARSUSDA  aDNAL 7aarticle02626naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001700139245020500156300001600361500002000377520128800397592002801685596005701713596003101770650001001801650001701811650001701828650001001845650001401855650001301869650003801882651001001920700001701930700002001947700005701967773013302024856007402157852000902231655001202240IND60753212120221120154231.0211011e202110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075321212DNAL7 a10.1111/pre.124662doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSano, Fumina10aFirst record of Neoporphyra haitanensis (T.J.Chang & B.F.Zheng) J.Brodie & L.‐E.Yang (Bangiales, Rhodophyta) from Shikinejima Island and Hachijojima Island of the Izu Islands, southern central Japan  ap. 258-265.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aWe conducted a morphological observation and molecular phylogenetic analyses on bladed Bangiales collected from natural populations on Shikinejima Island and Hachijojima Island of the Izu Islands, southern central Japan. The morphological features of the gametophytic blades such as the blade shape, blade margin and reproductive cell divisions were extremely similar to those parameters of Neoporphyra haitanensis, a species cultivated in southern China, and Neoporphyra dentata. However, the blades collected from the two islands were thicker than the blades of N. dentata; this feature was the same as that of N. haitanensis. The chloroplast RUBISCO spacer sequences of present samples were identical to the sequences of N. haitanensis from China. Moreover, phylogenetic positions of three conchocelis strains isolated from the blades on the two islands were examined based on concatenated sequences of the chloroplast rbcL gene and nuclear 18S rRNA. The results showed that the strains were resolved in a clade including N. haitanensis; however, the strains were separated from N. haitanensis in China. Therefore, the bladed Bangiales from the two islands were identified as N. haitanensis. The present study is the first record of N. haitanensis in natural populations in Japan.  aPublisher supplied data  a19K06184cJapan Society for the Promotion of Science  cNori Cultivation Promotion 3aJapan 3achloroplasts 3agametophytes 3agenes 3aphylogeny 3aresearch 3aribulose-bisphosphate carboxylase 3aChina1 aIkeura, Airi1 aTakasugi, Arata1 aNiwa, Kyosuke1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8404-89810 tPhycological research.g2021 Oct., v. 69, no. 4 p.258-265dJohn Wiley & Sons Australia, LtdwJournal:jnl3867101x1322-08297nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/pre.124663Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02542naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245008200169500002200251520137100273592002801644653002901672653001901701653001901720653001501739653002601754653002501780653002301805653001701828653001101845653002601856700002601882700002001908700001901928700002101947773009501968856008402063852000902147655001202156IND60562970620221119091057.0170731s2017    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056297062DNAL7 a10.1016/j.oncohp.2017.01.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMarcou, Aurore10aAnesthésies répétées en oncopédiatrie: spécificité, sécurité, impact  aPre-press version  aWith the development of new procedures in cancer treatment, general anesthesia is more and more often required for children for technical and comfort reasons. Anesthesia is required for high precision procedures from diagnosis (imaging, biopsies, eye fundus) to treatment (surgery, radiotherapy, in situ chemotherapy, venous catheterism). Radiotherapy in particular requires daily general anesthesia for several weeks.In order to describe anesthetic exposition in pediatric oncology, we studied a retrospective cohort of 140 children of 6 years old. We extract the anesthetic data of the children treated for a cancer, surviving after 6 years old and who we were able to follow up with.In monitoring 51 children, all have been exposed multiple times, regardless of the cancer treated. The intensity of exposure depended to the protocols of treatment associated to each cancer. The levels of exposure were high (mean of 1215min for acute leukemia). Anesthetic exposure is the highest before three years old.This practice when supported by adequate organization and specific protocols can be considered safe and well tolerated. However, possible long-term neurotoxic effects with possible impact on cognitive and learning development are discussed. This data recommends measured decisions and continued vigilance for a vulnerable population who are repeatedly exposed.  aPublisher supplied data 0aAnesthésies répétées 0aOncopédiatrie 0aRadiothérapie 0aSécurité 0aImpact neurocognitive 0aMultiple anesthesias 0aPediatric oncology 0aRadiotherapy 0aSafety 0aNeurocognitive impact1 aAbdelhafidh, Khoubeyb1 aKriegel, Irène1 aHelfre, Sylvie1 aGoater, Philippe0 tRevue d'Oncologie Hématologie Pédiatrique.g2017, dElsevier Masson SASx2213-46707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.oncohp.2017.01.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01813naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245012100159300001800280520055000298592002800848650001500876650001900891650001700910650002000927650001800947650001600965650001500981700002200996700002001018700002001038700001701058700002901075700002601104700002101130700002301151700002201174773012401196856007401320852000901394655001201403IND60663145020221118123148.0190909e20150803xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066314502DNAL7 a10.1039/c5gc00720h2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAnderson, Kris10aCarbon dioxide uptake from natural gas by binary ionic liquid–water mixtures [Erratum: Aug. 2015, v.17(8), p.4500]  ap. 4340-4354.  aCarbon dioxide solubility in a set of carboxylate ionic liquids formulated with stoicheiometric amounts of water is found to be significantly higher than for other ionic liquids previously reported.

In this study, consumers׳ smart grid acceptance factors, including the perceived risk, were examined with the existing technology acceptance model suggested by Davis. This study has an implication that it has provided theoretical and empirical ground, based on which the policies to promote consumer participation in the deployment of the smart grid can be developed. Since there are few studies on the policies from the perspective of the smart grid users, this study will contribute directly to the development of the strategy to ensure the acceptance of the smart grid.  aPublisher supplied data 3aconsumer acceptance 3aelectricity 3aissues and policy 3amodels 3arisk perception 3asurveys 3aKorean Peninsula 0aSmart grid 0aConsumer engagement 0aTechnology acceptance model1 aKim, Hyun Jae,1 aKim, Yang-Soo0 tEnergy Policy.g2014 Sept., v. 72 p.211-218dElsevier Ltdx0301-42157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enpol.2014.03.0173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02458naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002600140245009800166300001800264520123600282592002801518650001301546650001901559650001401578650002301592650002101615650002001636650001501656650001601671650001401687650001501701650001301716650001401729650001301743650001701756650001301773700002301786700002001809773012401829856007401953852000902027655001202036IND60663145120221118123141.0190909e20150706xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066314512DNAL7 a10.1039/c5gc00736d2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlbuquerque, Elise M.10aLactic acid production from hydroxyacetone on dual metal/base heterogeneous catalytic systems  ap. 3889-3899.  aOxidative aqueous-phase catalytic conversion of hydroxyacetone to lactic acid was investigated under mild and green reaction conditions. Dual metal/base catalyst systems were applied to replace the alkali hydroxide and address the separation requirements and corrosiveness issues usually involved in similar processes. Pt/Al₂O₃ was taken as the supported metal catalyst while Mg–Al layered double hydroxides (LDH) and their derived 3D mixed oxides were exploited as basic solid catalysts. The anion embedded within the LDH interlamellar domain (nitrate or hydroxyl) and the LDH topology (lamellar or exfoliated 2D nanosheets) were also examined. Activity and chemoselectivity of the dual system were shown to be tailored by the morphology, topology and basicity of the base catalyst. Catalytic activity was up to five times higher by adding a heterogeneous base solid to the metal catalyst. Surface site distribution was also shown to be quite decisive to the catalyst performance; the proximity of metal and basic centres on the same surface rendered highly selective bifunctional catalysts. A remarkable 100% selectivity to lactic acid was reached and the undesired cascade oxidation of lactic to pyruvic acid was hindered.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaluminum 3aaluminum oxide 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3achemoselectivity 3agreen chemistry 3ahydroxides 3alactic acid 3amagnesium 3ananosheets 3anitrates 3aoxidation 3aplatinum 3apyruvic acid 3atopology1 aBorges, Luiz E.

Here, we investigated the capacity of a widely used rabies inactivated vaccine (Rabisin, Boehringer-Ingelheim) for veterinary use to cross-protect mice experimentally infected with European bat lyssavirus 1 (EBLV-1b), European bat lyssavirus 2 (EBLV-2), and Bokeloh bat lyssavirus (BBLV) occurring in Europe. For each lyssavirus, we investigated the efficacy of two different doses of vaccine against two viral doses administrated by either central or peripheral routes. In parallel, seroconversion following pre-exposure vaccination was investigated. In this study, we demonstrated that the three investigated bat isolates were pathogenic, even at low dose, when inoculated by the central route but were not/less pathogenic when administrated peripherally. The Rabisin vaccine was capable of significantly cross-protecting mice inoculated intramuscularly with EBLV-1b and EBLV-2 and intracerebrally with BBLV. The level of rabies neutralizing antibodies induced by the Rabisin was quite high against the bat lyssaviruses, but with no significant differences between immunization with 1 and 5 IU/dose. The study emphasizes that the quality of rabies-inactivated vaccines for veterinary use is of utmost importance to optimize the cross-protection of pets against phylogroup I bat lyssaviruses occurring in Europe.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aChiroptera 3aEuropean bat lyssavirus 1 3aEuropean bat lyssavirus 2 3across immunity 3ahuman diseases 3ainactivated vaccines 3amice 3aneutralization 3aneutralizing antibodies 3apets 3arabies 3aseroconversion 3avaccination 3aEurope1 aWasniewski, Marine 1 aCliquet, Florence 0 tViruses.g2019 Oct. 11, v. 11, no. 10dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27138x1999-49157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/v111009363Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01832naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001200140245009000152300002000242520090100262592002801163650001401191650001301205700001601218700001701234700001601251700001101267700001801278700001501296773012401311856007401435852000901509655001201518IND60642046820221118025613.0190506e20170717xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064204682DNAL7 a10.1039/c7ra06237k2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWan, Yi10aIntramolecular charge transfer induced emission from triphenylamine-o-carborane dyads  ap. 35543-35548.  aTwo novel triphenylamine-o-carborane dyads with donor–acceptor architectures were designed and synthesized.

The results demonstrated that triphenylamine-o-carborane dyads presented locally excited (LE) emission and twisted intramolecular charge transfer (TICT) induced emission in various polar solvents, in which LE emission was not dependent on the solvent polarities and TICT emission was consistent with the solvent polarities. The solvent-dependent TICT emission with a large bathochromic shift exhibited a dramatic decrease in emissive efficiency with increasing the solvent polarity. More importantly, the triphenylamine-o-carborane dyads in solid states exhibited highly efficient ICT emissions, in which the ICT characteristics were confirmed by the experimental data and the density function theory (DFT) calculation results.  aPublisher supplied data 3aemissions 3asolvents1 aLi, Junfeng1 aPeng, Xuelei1 aHuang, Chao1 aQi, Qi1 aLai, Wen-Yong1 aHuang, Wei0 tRSC advances.g2017 July 17, v. 7, no. 56 p.35543-35548dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c7ra06237k3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03551naa a2200733 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024004700113040001800160100001600178245012100194300001600315520123400331592002801565650002301593650001601616650002001632650001501652650002801667650001201695650001701707650001501724650001001739650001701749650004501766650002601811650002301837650003301860650005601893650003501949650002501984650010502009650003802114650001502152650001202167650001102179650003802190650001302228650002402241650001102265650000902276650001302285650001402298650001902312650002002331650001702351651002602368700002102394700003802415700001702453700001902470700001602489700001502505700002502520700001902545700002002564773009602584856009302680990002302773852000902796655001202805IND60088913220221120205455.0141102e201206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008891322DNAL7 a225035472pmid7 a10.1016/j.atherosclerosis.2012.03.0262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCelik, Atac10aEvaluation of possible subclinical atherosclerosis in adolescents with a family history of premature atherosclerosis  ap. 537-540.  aOBJECTIVE: To evaluate possible subclinical atherosclerosis using biomarkers and ultrasound-guided methods in a group of adolescents having fathers with premature atherosclerosis. METHODS: Thirty-three subjects whose fathers had a history of premature coronary artery disease and 30 counterparts whose fathers had no history of coronary artery disease were included in the study. RESULTS: The homocysteine levels, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein levels, and cardiac chamber sizes and functions did not differ between the two groups. The carotid stiffness index β (CSI), the intima-media thickness (CIMT) and aortic pulse wave velocity (PWV) values were higher in the group with a family history of coronary artery disease, but only the difference in the CSI was statistically significant (CSI 3.07±1.33 vs 3.88±1.25, P=0.015; CIMT 0.53±0.09mm vs 0.57±0.08mm, P=0.068; PWV 3.49±0.53m/s vs 3.78±0.63m/s, P=0.053). CONCLUSION: Among several markers of subclinical atherosclerosis, the CSI was significantly higher in adolescents who had a family history of premature atherosclerosis. The small sample size, the multifactorial nature of atherosclerosis or the insufficient power of these methods may explain these results.  aPublisher supplied data 3aC-reactive protein 3aadolescents 3aatherosclerosis 3abiomarkers 3acoronary artery disease 3afathers 3ahomocysteine 2aAdolescent 2aAdult 2aAge of Onset 2aAortaxphysiopathologyxultrasonography. 2aAsymptomatic Diseases 2aBiomarkersxblood. 2aC-Reactive Proteinxanalysis 2aCarotid Arteriesxphysiopathologyxultrasonography. 2aCarotid Intima-Media Thickness 2aCase-Control Studies 2aCoronary Artery Diseasexbloodxdiagnosisxepidemiologyxgeneticsxphysiopathologyxultrasonography. 2aEchocardiography, Doppler, Pulsed 2aElasticity 2aFathers 2aFemale 2aGenetic Predisposition to Disease 2aHeredity 2aHomocysteinexblood 2aHumans 2aMale 2aPedigree 2aPhenotype 2aPulsatile Flow 2aRisk Assessment 2aRisk Factors 0aTurkeyxepidemiology.1 aOzcetin, Mustafa1 aCelikyay, Zekiye Ruken Yuksekkaya1 aSogut, Erkan1 aYerli, Yasemin1 aKadi, Hasan1 aKoc, Fatih1 aDamar, Ibrahim Halil1 aCeyhan, Koksal1 aErkorkmaz, Unal0 tAtherosclerosis.g2012 June, v. 222, no. 2 p.537-540dElsevier Ireland Ltdx0021-91507nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.atherosclerosis.2012.03.0263Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03266naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245006100166300001600227520160600243592002801849596007701877650002101954650002801975650001602003650003802019650001702057650002102074650003002095650001902125650001302144650000902157650001302166650002602179650002502205650001202230650002402242650001802266700001702284700001902301700002102320700001602341700002102357700002002378700002402398700002002422700002002442700002402462700001902486773011502505856008302620852000902703655001202712IND60645293620221118000720.0200528e201906  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064529362DNAL7 a10.1007/s11418-019-01283-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHan, Cheolsun10aAnalyses of the possible anti-tumor effect of yokukansan  ap. 468-479.  aThe Kampo medicine yokukansan (YKS) has a wide variety of properties such as anxiolytic, anti-inflammatory and analgesic effects, and is also thought to regulate tumor suppression. In this study, we investigated the anti-tumor effect of YKS. We used Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC)-bearing mice that were fed food pellets containing YKS and then performed a fecal microbiota analysis, a microarray analysis for microRNAs (miRNAs) and an in vitro anti-tumor assay. The fecal microbiota analysis revealed that treatment with YKS partly reversed changes in the microbiota composition due to LLC implantation. Furthermore, a miRNA array analysis using blood serum showed that treatment with YKS restored the levels of miR-133a-3p/133b-3p, miR-1a-3p and miR-342-3p following LLC implantation to normal levels. A TargetScan analysis revealed that the epidermal growth factor receptor 1 signaling pathway is one of the major target pathways for these miRNAs. Furthermore, treatment with YKS restored the levels of miR-200b-3p and miR-200c-3p, a recognized mediator of cancer progression and controller of emotion, in the hypothalamus of mice bearing LLC. An in vitro assay revealed that a mixture of pachymic acid, saikosaponins a and d and isoliquiritigenin, which are all contained in YKS, exerted direct and additive anti-tumor effects. The present findings constitute novel evidence that YKS may exert an anti-tumor effect by reversing changes in the fecal microbiota and miRNAs circulating in the blood serum and hypothalamus, and the compounds found in YKS could have direct and additive anti-tumor effects.  aPublisher supplied data  aS1411019cMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology 3aanalgesic effect 3aantineoplastic activity 3ablood serum 3aepidermal growth factor receptors 3ahypothalamus 3ain vitro studies 3aintestinal microorganisms 3alung neoplasms 3amedicine 3amice 3amicroRNA 3amicroarray technology 3aneoplasm progression 3apellets 3asignal transduction 3atranquilizers1 aKawata, Miho1 aHamada, Yusuke1 aKondo, Takashige1 aWada, Junna1 aAsano, Katsunori1 aMakabe, Hitoshi1 aIgarashi, Katsuhide1 aKuzumaki, Naoko1 aNarita, Michiko1 aKobayashi, Hiroyuki1 aNarita, Minoru0 tNatural medicines.g2019 June, v. 73, no. 3 p.468-479dSpringer SingaporewJournal:jnl4059015x1340-34437nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11418-019-01283-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04359naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002200151245017000173300001400343520261100357592002802968650001202996650001903008650002303027650002503050650001403075650001903089650000903108650001403117650001503131650002103146650001303167650002203180650002303202650001103225650001203236650002203248650001003270650000903280650001403289650001803303650001603321650001603337650001203353650001503365651001203380653001003392653003103402653002303433653001003456653003203466700002403498700002703522773011303549856008603662852000903748655001203757IND60537964020221116205856.0190412e201409  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053796402DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecolind.2013.10.0262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCook, Geoffrey S.10aTowards marine ecosystem based management in South Florida: Investigating the connections among ecosystem pressures, states, and services in a complex coastal system  ap. 26-39.  aMarine ecosystem based management plans are gaining popularity with natural resource managers, but examples of their successful implementation remain few. The complexity inherent in marine ecosystems presents a major obstacle to understanding how individual ecosystem pressures impact multiple ecosystem states that in turn impact the provisioning of ecosystem services. To create and implement successful ecosystem based management plans will require tools for understanding these processes. Over the past three years integrated conceptual ecosystem models of the coastal marine environment have been developed as part of the Marine and Estuarine Goal Setting for South Florida (MARES) project. Here we use these conceptual models in conjunction with a modified DPSIR model, expert opinion and matrix-based analyses to explore the direct and indirect relative impact of 12 ecosystem pressures on 11 ecosystem states and 11 ecosystem services identified through MARES. Within the South Florida coastal ecosystem the most pervasive pressures were freshwater delivery, temperature effects of climate change, and impacts of climate change on weather. For the study region the least pervasive pressures were recreational fishing, commercial fishing, and invasive species. The most at risk ecosystem states, as determined by cumulative impacts were fish and shellfish, protected species, and marine birds. By the same measure, the least at risk states were oyster reefs and inshore flats. The most at risk ecosystem services were existence of a natural system, pristine wilderness experience, and non-extractive recreation. The least impacted ecosystem services were commercial extraction, recreational fishing and climate stability. When the relative direct and indirect (i.e. including state to state interactions) impacts of ecosystem pressures were traced to individual ecosystem services, it was apparent that within the study domain a lack of freshwater delivery to coastal estuaries was the predominant pressure, and recreational fishing had the lowest relative impact on the provisioning of ecosystem services. Through this expert opinion analysis and exploration of the interaction strength among various ecosystem pressures, states, and ecosystem services, we can begin to understand the diverse manners in which ecosystem services are impacted by various pressures. In so doing we provide a tool for resource managers to understand the trade-offs among individual user groups and the possible impact on provisioning of ecosystem services that may occur when considering various management strategies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3aecosystem services 3aenvironmental impact 3aestuaries 3aexpert opinion 3afish 3afisheries 3afreshwater 3ainvasive species 3amanagers 3amarine ecosystems 3amarine environment 3amodels 3aoysters 3aprotected species 3areefs 3arisk 3ashellfish 3asport fishing 3atemperature 3awater birds 3aweather 3awilderness 3aFlorida 0aDPSIR 0aEcosystem based management 0aEcosystem services 0aMARES 0aSocial–ecological systems1 aFletcher, Pamela J.1 aKelble, Christopher R.0 tEcological indicators.g2014 Sept., v. 44 p.26-39dElsevier LtdaElsevier LtdwJournal:6196x1470-160X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2013.10.0263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01845naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001700140245013300157300001800290520053600308592002800844650001000872650001400882650001800896650001500914650001400929650002300943650002000966650001900986650001901005650001801024650001401042650002101056650001301077650001301090650001601103700001901119700001801138700001801156700001801174773012401192856007401316852000901390655001201399IND60663145220221118123212.0190909e20150608xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066314522DNAL7 a10.1039/c5gc00745c2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLee, Yongwoo10aCatalytic allylic arylation of cinnamyl carbonates over palladium nanoparticles supported on a thermoresponsive polymer in water  ap. 3579-3583.  aPoly(NIPAM-co-4-VP) undergoes a phase transition at the low critical solution temperature with a change from the hydrophilic to the hydrophobic core in a hydrophilic solvent.

The new species can be distinguished from other foliose Bangiales species by both molecular analysis and developmentally with the production of new blades arising from rhizoidal cells and giving rise to multiple blades. Thalli of N. kitoi were observed to produce single and multiple blades in both fields collected and cultured thalli. Neoporphyra kitoi was morphologically similar to Pyropia pseudolinearis apart from this developmental feature. Molecular phylogenies based on both the nrSSU and rbcL genes of this species resolved it in a clade containing sequences assigned to the genus Neoporphyra.  aPublisher supplied data 3aJapan 3aPyropia 3anew species 3aphylogeny 3aresearch 3athallus1 aKikuchi, Norio1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9710-04161 aTamaki, Motoya1 aSato, Tomoko1 aMurase, Noboru1 aFujiyoshi, Eiji1 aKobayashi, Masahiro0 tPhycological research.g2021 Oct., v. 69, no. 4 p.237-245dJohn Wiley & Sons Australia, LtdwJournal:jnl3867101x1322-08297nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/pre.124643Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03147naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245011200158520188800270592002802158650003002186650002902216650005302245650001602298650001402314650001802328650001202346650001102358650001402369650001102383650002402394650002402418700001902442700001402461700002002475700001502495700002102510773012302531856007402654852000902728655001202737IND60751642820221119022737.0210925e20210902xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075164282DNAL7 a10.3390/nu130930892doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Rutong,10aAssociation of Dietary Vitamin D Intake, Serum 25(OH)D3, 25(OH)D2 with Cognitive Performance in the Elderly  aBackground: As life expectancy increases, cognitive performance decline in the elderly has become one of the major global challenges. We aimed to evaluate the association of dietary vitamin D (VD), serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 (25(OH)D₃), 25-hydroxyvitamin D2 (25(OH)D₂), and total 25-hydroxyvitamin (25(OH)D) concentration with cognitive performance in older Americans. Methods: The data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), 2011–2014 was used. The cognitive performance was assessed by the Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer’s Disease (CERAD) Word Learning sub-test, Animal Fluency test, and Digit Symbol Substitution Test (DSST). A binary logistic regression model was applied to evaluate the association between VD and cognitive performance, and restricted cubic spline model was adopted to evaluate the dose–response relationship. Results: While comparing to the lowest dietary VD intake group, the multivariate adjusted odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of the highest dietary VD intake group were 0.51 (0.36–0.72) for the Animal Fluency test score and 0.45 (0.31–0.66) for DSST score, respectively; and those of serum total 25(OH)D and 25(OH)D₃ concentration were 0.68 (0.47–0.97) and 0.62 (0.44–0.86) for DSST score. L-shaped relationships were identified for dietary VD intake, serum total 25(OH)D and 25(OH)D₃ concentration with cognition performance. The associations between dietary VD intake, serum total 25(OH)D and cognitive performance were non-significant when stratified by gender. Conclusions: The study indicates that dietary VD intake, serum total 25(OH)D and 25(OH)D₃ concentration were positively associated with cognitive performance. Further studies are needed to clarify the possible effects of dietary VD intake and serum 25(OH)D₂, 25(OH)D₃ on cognitive performance.  aPublisher supplied data 3a25-hydroxycholecalciferol 3a25-hydroxyergocalciferol 3aNational Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 3ablood serum 3acognition 3adose response 3aelderly 3agender 3alongevity 3amodels 3apsychological tests 3aregression analysis1 aWang, Weijing 1 aHu, Ping 1 aZhang, Ronghui 1 aDong, Xue 1 aZhang, Dongfeng 0 tNutrients.g2021 Sept. 02, v. 13, no. 9dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2271x2072-66437nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/nu130930893Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02783naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094024002200121024001900143040001800162100002300180245010500203506007600308520142400384592002801808506003701836650004801873650001801921650002401939650001701963650002001980650001802000650002002018650002202038650000902060650002202069650001402091650001502105650001202120700002402132773012302156856007302279852000902352655001202361IND60674582920221207065826.0191025e20190921xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067458292DNAL7 a10.3390/v111008852doi7 aPMC68327012pmcid7 a315465862pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFousteri, Georgia 10aViral Infections and Autoimmune Disease: Roles of LCMV in Delineating Mechanisms of Immune Tolerance  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aViral infections are a natural part of our existence. They can affect us in many ways that are the result of the interaction between the viral pathogen and our immune system. Most times, the resulting immune response is beneficial for the host. The pathogen is cleared, thus protecting our vital organs with no other consequences. Conversely, the reaction of our immune system against the pathogen can cause organ damage (immunopathology) or lead to autoimmune disease. To date, there are several mechanisms for virus-induced autoimmune disease, including molecular mimicry and bystander activation, in support of the &ldquo;fertile field&rdquo; hypothesis (terms defined in our review). In contrast, viral infections have been associated with protection from autoimmunity through mechanisms that include Treg invigoration and immune deviation, in support of the &ldquo;hygiene hypothesis&rdquo;, also defined here. Infection with lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) is one of the prototypes showing that the interaction of our immune system with viruses can either accelerate or prevent autoimmunity. Studies using mouse models of LCMV have helped conceive and establish several concepts that we now know and use to explain how viruses can lead to autoimmune activation or induce tolerance. Some of the most important mechanisms established during the course of LCMV infection are described in this short review.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aLymphocytic choriomeningitis mammarenavirus 3aanimal models 3aautoimmune diseases 3aautoimmunity 3aimmune response 3aimmune system 3aimmunopathology 3aimmunosuppression 3amice 3amolecular mimicry 3apathogens 3aprototypes 3aviruses1 aDave Jhatakia, Amy 0 tViruses.g2019 Sept. 21, v. 11, no. 10dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27138x1999-49157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/v111008853Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02253naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002600150245008100176300001400257520091700271592002801188650002001216650001201236650001001248650001001258650001101268650001201279650003001291650001401321650003101335651001701366651000901383653001101392653000901403653002301412653001301435700002701448700002201475700002001497700002701517700001601544773014201560856008401702852000901786655001201795IND60601693720221119205638.0180706e201402  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060169372DNAL7 a10.1016/j.parint.2013.10.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGomez-Puerta, Luis A.10aOccurrence of Giardia duodenalis assemblages in alpacas in the Andean region  ap. 31-34.  aIn this study, 352 fecal samples were analyzed for G. duodenalis from alpaca mothers and crias from three different areas of highland in Peru. The triosephosphate isomerase (TPI) gene of Giardia was amplified using a nested PCR protocol. Forty-six G. duodenalis-PCR positive samples were sequenced. G. duodenalis assemblage A was the most frequent followed by assemblage E. The former was seen in 37 animals whereas the latter was seen in nine. Most of the assemblage A infections were caused by the A1 subtype of sub-assemblage AI, except for three, which were caused by the A2 subtype of sub-assemblage AI. Assemblage A was found in all three geographic regions, while assemblage E was detected in crias from two regions. Among the four alpaca mothers positive for Giardia, three had assemblage AI and one had assemblage AII.

More than 230 clinically relevant genetic variants have been described. We investigated the variation in G6PD activity within and between different genetic variants. In this systematic review, individual patient data from studies reporting G6PD activity measured by spectrophotometry and corresponding the G6PD genotype were pooled (PROSPERO: CRD42020207448). G6PD activity was converted into percent normal activity applying study-specific definitions of 100%. In total, 4320 individuals from 17 studies across 10 countries were included, where 1738 (40.2%) had one of the 24 confirmed G6PD mutations, and 61 observations (3.5%) were identified as outliers. The median activity of the hemi-/homozygotes with A-(c.202G>A/c.376A>G) was 29.0% (range: 1.7% to 76.6%), 10.2% (range: 0.0% to 32.5%) for Mahidol, 16.9% (range 3.3% to 21.3%) for Mediterranean, 9.0% (range: 2.9% to 23.2%) for Vanua Lava, and 7.5% (range: 0.0% to 18.3%) for Viangchan. The median activity in heterozygotes was 72.1% (range: 16.4% to 127.1%) for A-(c.202G>A/c.376A>G), 54.5% (range: 0.0% to 112.8%) for Mahidol, 37.9% (range: 20.7% to 80.5%) for Mediterranean, 53.8% (range: 10.9% to 82.5%) for Vanua Lava, and 52.3% (range: 4.8% to 78.6%) for Viangchan. A total of 99.5% of hemi/homozygotes with the Mahidol mutation and 100% of those with the Mediterranean, Vanua Lava, and Viangchan mutations had <30% activity. For A-(c.202G>A/c.376A>G), 55% of hemi/homozygotes had <30% activity. The G6PD activity for each variant spanned the current classification thresholds used to define clinically relevant categories of enzymatic deficiency.  aPublisher supplied data 3aNADP-glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase 3aenzyme activity 3ahemolysis 3aheterozygosity 3ahomozygosity 3alava 3ameta-analysis 3amutation 3apatients 3aspectroscopy 3asystematic review1 aSatyagraha, Ari Winasti1 aSadhewa, Arkasha 1 aAlam, Mohammad Shafiul1 aBancone, Germana 1 aBoum, Yap 1 aBrito, Marcelo 1 aCui, Liwang 1 aDeng, Zeshuai 1 aDomingo, Gonzalo J.1 aHe, Yongshu 1 aKhan, Wasif A.1 aKibria, Mohammad Golam1 aLacerda, Marcus 1 aMenard, Didier 1 aMonteiro, Wuelton 1 aPal, Sampa 1 aParikh, Sunil 1 aRoca-Feltrer, Arantxa 1 aRoh, Michelle 1 aSirdah, Mahmoud M.1 aWang, Duoquan 1 aHuang, Qiuying 1 aHowes, Rosalind E.1 aPrice, Ric,1 aLey, Benedikt 0 tPathogens.g2022 Sept. 14, v. 11, no. 9dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27146x2076-08177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/pathogens110910453Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03084naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006100148245011200209300001600321520171700337592002802054650001702082650002402099650001102123650001802134650001002152650001902162650002002181650000902201650001402210650002002224650001902244650001202263650001602275650001002291651001202301700002102313700002302334700002302357700001702380700002402397773011302421856008302534852000902617655001202626IND60777723020221119022733.0220520e202205  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077772302DNAL7 a10.1007/s00442-022-05163-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMarsh, Jessica E.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1154-444410aDensity-dependence and environmental variability have stage-specific influences on European grayling growth  ap. 103-117.  aFish somatic growth is indeterminate and can be influenced by a range of abiotic and biotic variables. With climate change forecast to increase the frequency of warming and unusual discharge events, it is thus important to understand how these variables currently influence somatic growth and how that might differ for specific age-classes and/ or life stages. Here, we used a 17-year dataset from a chalk stream in southern England to identify the abiotic and biotic influences on the growth of juvenile, sub-adult and adult life stages of European grayling (Thymallus thymallus), a cold-water riverine salmonid. The results revealed that interannual variations in grayling growth were well described by annual- and site-specific abiotic and biotic explanatory variables. We found divergent responses between life stages to increased temperature and unusual discharge during the main growth period with, for example, elevated temperatures related to increased juvenile growth but reduced sub-adult growth, and high discharge events related to increased sub-adult growth yet reduced juvenile growth. Conversely, stage-specific grayling abundance negatively influenced growth at each life stage, though only juvenile growth was impacted by the abundance of a competitor species, brown trout (Salmo trutta). These results emphasise the merits of testing a wide range of environmental and biological explanatory variables on fish growth, and across life stages. They also reveal the importance of maintaining high habitat heterogeneity in rivers to ensure all life stages can reduce their competitive interactions and have access to adequate flow and thermal refugia during periods of elevated environmental stress.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSalmo trutta 3aThymallus thymallus 3aadults 3aanimal growth 3achalk 3aclimate change 3adata collection 3afish 3ajuveniles 3arefuge habitats 3ariparian areas 3astreams 3atemperature 3awater 3aEngland1 aCove, Richard J.1 aBritton, J.

The challenge is to simultaneously analyze various pesticides and transformation products in water as they have distinct physicochemical properties. A mix‐mode solid phase extraction method was established to simultaneously analyze current‐use pesticides and their transformation products using a mixture of hydrophile–lipophile balance, weak anion, and cation exchange resins (2:1:1, w/w/w) in combination with high‐performance liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry for chemical quantification. Neutral, acidic, and alkaline methanol were used as the elution solvent. Box‐Behnken design was applied to optimize extraction conditions. Optimal conditions were as follows: sorbent mass, 200 mg; volume of elution solvent, 5 mL × 3; pH 4. The method was validated for compounds at concentrations from 20 to 1000 ng/L in different types of water samples, with recovery being from 43.5 ± 3.1 to 141 ± 35%. Low method detection limits (0.02−5.6 ng/L) implied that the developed method was sensitive. Finally, the method was applied to monitor current‐use pesticides and their transformation products in natural waters. Frequent detection of transformation products of pesticides indicated that their contribution to aquatic risk should not be ignored.  aPublisher supplied data  aU1901220cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a41773101cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a2017A020216002cGuangdong Provincial Department of Science and Technology  a2015TX01Z168cGuangdong Provincial Department of Science and Technology 3acation exchange 3aexperimental design 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3amethanol 3apH 3arisk 3aseparation 3asolid phase extraction 3asolvents 3asorbents 3atandem mass spectrometry1 aXiong, Jingjing1 aLi, Huizhen1 aYau, Ching,1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4006-83390 tJournal of separation science.g2020 June, v. 43, no. 12 p.2409-2418dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3924049x1615-93067nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jssc.2020001153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02872naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002400151245011200175300001600287520113700303536022101440592002801661596001501689650002201704650001601726650002501742650001201767650001201779650003101791650001301822650002201835650002301857650002101880650001901901650001701920650001201937650001401949650001701963650001001980653001001990653002402000653002802024653002402052700001802076700001902094700001902113773012702132856008602259852000902345655001202354IND60679274520221119194632.0210310e20190101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067927452DNAL7 a10.1080/17429145.2019.16620982doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAmoah, Joseph Noble10aEffect of drought acclimation on oxidative stress and transcript expression in wheat (Triticum aestivum L.)  ap. 492-505.  aThe effects of drought acclimation on plant growth and water relations, membrane status, photosynthetic activity, proline content, membrane lipid peroxidation, enzyme antioxidant activity, and drought-responsive gene expression patterns were investigated under progressive drought conditions with drought acclimation (DA) and non-acclimation (NA) treatments in four wheat genotypes. Initial water stressapplied at 10 days after seedling transfer induced acclimation to subsequent water stress (S2), following re-watering. A reversible decline in plant growth and water relations, membrane stability, and photosynthetic activity resulted in increased lipid peroxidation, reactive oxygen species, membrane injury, enzyme antioxidant activities, and H₂O₂ and osmolyte accumulation in DA plants. TaWRKY2, TaNAC1, TaMYB2, TabHLH1, and TabZIP1 levels were upregulated to a greater extent in NA than in DA plants, during S2. The results suggest wheat plants employ physiological, biochemical and molecular mechanism under drought improving their ability to survive subsequent water stress in the later period of growth and development.  aThis work was conducted with support from the ‘Next - Generation of BioGreen21 Program for Agriculture and Technology Development (Project No. PJ01324401)’ Rural Development Administration, The Republic of Korea.  aPublisher supplied data  aPJ01324401 3aTriticum aestivum 3aacclimation 3aantioxidant activity 3adrought 3aenzymes 3agene expression regulation 3agenotype 3ahydrogen peroxide 3alipid peroxidation 3aoxidative stress 3aphotosynthesis 3aplant growth 3aproline 3aseedlings 3awater stress 3awheat 0aWheat 0adrought acclimation 0areactive oxygen species 0atranscript analysis1 aKo, Chan Seop1 aYoon, Jin Seok1 aWeon, Seo Yong0 tJournal of plant interactions.g2019 Jan. 1, v. 14, no. 1 p.492-505dTaylor & FranciswJournal:J000000112x1742-91537nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/17429145.2019.16620983Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02455naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100005900150245011400209300002000323500001900343520126300362592002801625650001201653650002201665650002301687650001301710650001901723650001901742650001801761650001501779650001301794650001601807700006001823773011601883856008501999852000902084655001202093IND60721983220221122162319.0210114e20201216xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072198322DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.langmuir.0c025952doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHunter, Saul J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9280-196910aPickering Emulsifiers Based on Block Copolymer Nanoparticles Prepared by Polymerization-Induced Self-Assembly  ap. 15463-15484.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aBlock copolymer nanoparticles prepared via polymerization-induced self-assembly (PISA) represent an emerging class of organic Pickering emulsifiers. Such nanoparticles are readily prepared by chain-extending a soluble homopolymer precursor using a carefully selected second monomer that forms an insoluble block in the chosen solvent. As the second block grows, it undergoes phase separation that drives in situ self-assembly to form sterically stabilized nanoparticles. Conducting such PISA syntheses in aqueous solution leads to hydrophilic nanoparticles that enable the formation of oil-in-water emulsions. Alternatively, hydrophobic nanoparticles can be prepared in non-polar media (e.g., n-alkanes), which enables water-in-oil emulsions to be produced. In this review, the specific advantages of using PISA to prepare such bespoke Pickering emulsifiers are highlighted, which include fine control over particle size, copolymer morphology, and surface wettability. This has enabled various fundamental scientific questions regarding Pickering emulsions to be addressed. Moreover, block copolymer nanoparticles can be used to prepare Pickering emulsions over various length scales, with mean droplet diameters ranging from millimeters to less than 200 nm.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalkanes 3aaqueous solutions 3acomposite polymers 3adroplets 3ahydrophilicity 3ahydrophobicity 3aparticle size 3aseparation 3asolvents 3awettability1 aArmes, Steven P.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8289-63510 tLangmuir.g2020 Dec. 16, v. 36, no. 51 p.15463-15484dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19170x1520-58277nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.langmuir.0c025953Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01426naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002000140245014000160300001800300520030200318592002800620650002700648650002300675650002300698650001500721650001200736650002600748700001500774700001800789700001800807700001700825700001700842773013300859856007500992852000901067655001201076IND60659046920221118201254.0190827e20110809xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065904692DNAL7 a10.1039/c1cc13276h2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Lingcheng10aSelf-host heteroleptic green iridium dendrimers: achieving efficient non-doped device performance based on a simple molecular structure  ap. 9519-9521.  aSelf-host heteroleptic green iridium(iii) dendrimers have been designed and easily synthesized.

Thus, understanding coevolution may require investigating broad sets of populations sampled across the range of the interaction. In addition, comparing coevolutionary dynamics between similar systems may reveal the importance of specific factors that structure coevolution. Here, we examine geographic patterns of prey traits and predator traits in the relatively unstudied interaction between the Sierra garter snake (Thamnophis couchii) and sympatric prey, the rough‐skinned newt (Taricha granulosa), Sierra newt (Ta. sierrae) and California newt (Ta. torosa). This system parallels, in space and phenotypes, a classic example of coevolution between predatory common garter snakes (Th. sirtalis) and their toxic newt prey exhibiting hotspots of newt tetrodotoxin (TTX) levels and matching snake TTX resistance. We quantified prey and predator traits from hundreds of individuals across their distributions, and functional trait matching at sympatric sites. We show strong regional patterns of trait covariation across the shared ranges of Th. couchii and newt prey. Traits differ significantly among localities, with lower newt TTX levels and snake TTX resistance at the northern latitudes, and higher TTX levels and snake resistance at southern latitudes. Newts and snakes in northern populations show the highest degree of functional trait matching despite possessing the least extreme traits. Conversely, newts and snakes in southern populations show the greatest mismatch despite possessing exaggerated traits, with some snakes so resistant to TTX they would be unaffected by any sympatric newt. Nevertheless, individual variation was substantial, and appears to offer the opportunity for continued reciprocal selection in most populations. Overall, the three species of newts appear to be engaged in a TTX‐mediated arms race with Th. couchii. These patterns are congruent with those seen between newts and Th. sirtalis, including the same latitudinal gradient in trait covariation, and the potential ‘escape’ from the arms race by snake predators. Such concordance in broad scale patterns across two distinct systems suggests common phenomena might structure geographic mosaics in similar ways.  aPublisher supplied data  aIOS1355221cNSF: Division of Integrative Organismal Systems  aDEB0922251cNSF: Division of Environmental Biology  aDEB1034686cNSF: Division of Environmental Biology 3aTaricha torosa 3aanimal ecology 3acoevolution 3alandscapes 3asalamanders and newts 3asnakes 3asympatry 3atetrodotoxin 3atoxicity1 aBrodie, Edmund D., Jr.cJr.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5739-47471 aStokes, Amber N.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6935-77941 aEly, Erica J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2457-01901 aMoniz, Haley A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2838-511X1 aThill, Vicki L.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6999-09091 aHallas, Joshua M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4147-40371 aPfrender, Michael E.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6861-06551 aBrodie, Edmund D., IIIcIII1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9231-83471 aFeldman, Chris R.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2988-31450 tjournal of animal ecology.g2020 July, v. 89, no. 7 p.1645-1657dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl16424x0021-87907nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1365-2656.132123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02600naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005600148245013000204300001600334520135200350592002801702596005501730596005501785596004101840650001301881650002401894650001301918650001501931650001401946650000901960700001701969700001801986700002902004773011302033856008302146852000902229655001202238IND60777723220221119022729.0220520e202205  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077772322DNAL7 a10.1007/s00442-022-05178-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWolfe, Ellie1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5161-435010aLandscape configuration affects probability of apex predator presence and community structure in experimental metacommunities  ap. 193-204.  aBiodiversity is declining at an unprecedented rate, highlighting the urgent requirement for well-designed protected areas. Design tactics previously proposed to promote biodiversity include enhancing the number, connectivity, and heterogeneity of reserve patches. However, how the importance of these features changes depending on what the conservation objective is remains poorly understood. Here we use experimental landscapes containing ciliate protozoa to investigate how the number and heterogeneity in size of habitat patches, rates of dispersal between neighbouring patches, and mortality risk of dispersal across the non-habitat ‘matrix’ interact to affect a number of diversity measures. We show that increasing the number of patches significantly increases γ diversity and reduces the overall number of extinctions, whilst landscapes with heterogeneous patch sizes have significantly higher γ diversity than those with homogeneous patch sizes. Furthermore, the responses of predators depended on their feeding specialism, with generalist predator presence being highest in a single large patch, whilst specialist predator presence was highest in several-small patches with matrix dispersal. Our evidence emphasises the importance of considering multiple diversity measures to disentangle community responses to patch configuration.  aPublisher supplied data  aNE/T003502/1cNatural Environment Research Council  aNE/T006579/1cNatural Environment Research Council  a1916610cNational Science Foundation 3aProtozoa 3acommunity structure 3ahabitats 3alandscapes 3amortality 3arisk1 aHammill, Edd1 aMemmott, Jane1 aClements, Christopher F.0 tOecologia.g2022 May, v. 199, no. 1 p.193-204dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl44754x0029-85497nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00442-022-05178-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02393naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002000143245011300163500001400276520105300290592002801343650001801371650003401389650001701423650001501440650001001455650001401465650001601479650001701495650001801512650002101530650002001551650001301571650001401584650001701598700002301615700002701638700002301665700002401688700002301712773012601735856007701861852000901938655001201947IND60711634820221119024103.0200928e20200922xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071163482DNAL7 a10.3390/antiox90909012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aObrador, Elena 10aOxidative Stress, Neuroinflammation and Mitochondria in the Pathophysiology of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis  aNAL-light  aAmyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a progressive motor neuron (MN) disease. Its primary cause remains elusive, although a combination of different causal factors cannot be ruled out. There is no cure, and prognosis is poor. Most patients with ALS die due to disease-related complications, such as respiratory failure, within three years of diagnosis. While the underlying mechanisms are unclear, different cell types (microglia, astrocytes, macrophages and T cell subsets) appear to play key roles in the pathophysiology of the disease. Neuroinflammation and oxidative stress pave the way leading to neurodegeneration and MN death. ALS-associated mitochondrial dysfunction occurs at different levels, and these organelles are involved in the mechanism of MN death. Molecular and cellular interactions are presented here as a sequential cascade of events. Based on our present knowledge, the discussion leads to the idea that feasible therapeutic strategies should focus in interfering with the pathophysiology of the disease at different steps.  aPublisher supplied data 3aT-lymphocytes 3aamyotrophic lateral sclerosis 3aantioxidants 3aastrocytes 3adeath 3aknowledge 3amacrophages 3amitochondria 3amotor neurons 3aoxidative stress 3apathophysiology 3apatients 3aprognosis 3atherapeutics1 aSalvador, Rosario 1 aLópez-Blanch, Rafael 1 aJihad-Jebbar, Ali 1 aVallés, Soraya  L.1 aEstrela, José  M.0 tAntioxidants.g2020 Sept. 22, v. 9, no. 9dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27130x2076-39217nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/antiox90909013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02491naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245008600164300001600250520131600266592002801582650002401610650002301634650001501657650001101672650001401683650001101697650001101708650001801719650001301737650001601750651001101766700001901777700001601796700002301812700002001835700002101855700002301876773008001899856008101979852000902060655001202069IND50067880320221121062732.0150207e201308  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006788032DNAL7 a10.1007/s00468-013-0847-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aImada, Shogo10aSalt dynamics in Tamarix ramosissima in the lower Virgin River floodplain, Nevada  ap. 949-958.  aTamarisk (Tamarix spp.) is a halophyte with salt glands on its leaves and is an invasive riparian plant in the US. To increase our understanding of the effects of Tamarix on soil salinity, we conducted a year-long field investigation to evaluate the salt dynamics of a stand of Tamarix ramosissima along the lower Virgin River floodplain, NV, USA. We examined salt accumulation in the biomass and studied salt return to the soil by litter fall, throughfall and stemflow from September 2009 to September 2010. We also investigated soil salinity concentrations inside and outside of the stand where native shrub species was sparsely distributed. The average Na⁺accumulated in the plant biomass was estimated at 23.4 g m⁻². The Na⁺returned to the soil through litter fall, throughfall and stemflow during the investigation was similar with that accumulated in the plant biomass. More than 90 % of Na⁺leached to the soil was from throughfall and stemflow. Soil salinity was significantly lower inside than outside of the stand. Salt secretion from Tamarix is generally expected to increase soil salinity in stands. However, our results suggest that surface soil salinity does not necessarily increase in the Tamarix stand along the lower Virgin River floodplain that is subjected to occasional flooding.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTamarix ramosissima 3abiomass production 3ahalophytes 3aleaves 3asecretion 3ashrubs 3asodium 3asoil salinity 3astemflow 3athroughfall 3aNevada1 aAcharya, Kumud1 aLi, Yi-ping1 aTaniguchi, Takeshi1 aIwanaga, Fumiko1 aYamamoto, Fukuju1 aYamanaka, Norikazu0 tTrees.g2013 Aug., v. 27, no. 4 p.949-958dSpringer-Verlagx0931-18907nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00468-013-0847-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01479naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001600140245014500156300001800301520027400319592002800593650002100621650002700642650002300669650002300692650001600715650002000731650002000751650001600771650001300787650001500800700001200815700001500827700001700842700001700859773013300876856007501009852000901084655001201093IND60659047120221118200901.0190827e20110802xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065904712DNAL7 a10.1039/c1cc13279b2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSong, Yujun10aLight regulation of peroxidase activity by spiropyran functionalized carbon nanotubes used for label-free colorimetric detection of lysozyme  ap. 9083-9085.  aSpiropyran dye-modified multi-walled carbon nanotubes have been synthesized and used to regulate horseradish peroxidase activity by light irradiation.

Here, we adopt a bioclimatic approach based on the Köppen classification to focus on the evolution of warm semi-arid regions over the projected twenty-first century, following three socio-economic scenarios and 12 global climate models from the last IPCC exercise (CMIP5). We show that a global expansion of this climatic domain has already started according to climate observations in the twentieth century (about + 13% of surface increase, i.e. from 6 to 7% of the global land surface). Models project that this expansion will continue throughout the twenty-first century, whatever the scenario: for the most dramatic one (RCP 8.5), the share of the total land surface occupied by warm semi-arid surfaces is about 38% higher in 2100 compared to the present (from ∼ 7 to ∼ 9% of the global land surface). This expansion will essentially take place outside of the tropical belt, showing a poleward migration as large as 11∘ of latitude in the Northern Hemisphere. This expansion is linearly correlated with the projected future global warming (about 853 millions km² per degree of warming for RCP 8.5). Different types of climate class transitions and their associated mechanisms are discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aarid lands 3aclimate models 3aglobal warming 3alatitude 3asemiarid zones 3asocioeconomics1 aNoblet-Ducoudré, Nathalie de0 tClimatic change.g2017 Oct., v. 144, no. 4 p.703-719dSpringer Netherlandsx0165-00097nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10584-017-2052-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01230naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001600140245010900156300002000265520023300285592002800518650001200546650001400558650002300572650002700595650002000622650001500642650002200657700001700679773013600696856007500832852000900907655001200916IND60659047220221120123501.0190827e20111011xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065904722DNAL7 a10.1039/c1cc13285g2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPal, Amrita12aA DFT investigation of the potential of porous cages for the catalysis of ammonia borane dehydrogenation  ap. 11417-11419.  aFull DFT based quantum mechanical studies reveal that zero dimensional porous structures, especially the newly proposed phosphorus incorporated organic cages, can be excellent catalysts for the dehydrogenation of ammonia borane.  aPublisher supplied data 3aammonia 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3achemical communication 3adehydrogenation 3aphosphorus 3aquantum mechanics1 aVanka, Kumar0 tChemical communications.g2011 Oct. 11, v. 47, no. 41 p.11417-11419dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26910x1364-548X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c1cc13285g3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01948naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002100152245011100173300001600284520079500300592002801095650002001123650002101143650001801164650002401182650001701206653001901223653001601242653003101258653002001289653001501309700003101324700002301355773011301378856008601491852000901577655001201586IND60600247120221119070829.0180703e201409  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060024712DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enconman.2014.06.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBayat, Hamidreza10aExperimental study of thermal–hydraulic performance of cam-shaped tube bundle with staggered arrangement  ap. 470-476.  aFlow and heat transfer from cam-shaped tube bank in staggered arrangement is studied experimentally.

Moreover, pressure drop from this tube bank is about 92–93% lower than circular tube bank and as a result thermal–hydraulic performance of this tube bank is about 6 times greater than circular tube bank.  aPublisher supplied data 3aReynolds number 3adrag coefficient 3aheat transfer 3asurface temperature 3awind tunnels 0aHeat exchanger 0aTube bundle 0aExperimental heat transfer 0aCam-shaped tube 0aCross-flow1 aLavasani, Arash Mirabdolah1 aMaarefdoost, Taher0 tEnergy conversion and management.g2014 Sept., v. 85 p.470-476dElsevier LtdwJournal:11831x0196-89047nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enconman.2014.06.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01203naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001200140245007200152300001800224520023200242592002800474650002300502650002100525650001700546650002300563700001400586700001600600700001500616700001600631700001300647773013400660856007400794852000900868655001200877IND60660247220221120091434.0190823e20140617xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066024722DNAL7 a10.1039/c4cc03540b2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLv, Xin12aA specific fluorescent probe for NO based on a new NO-binding group  ap. 7499-7502.  aBy incorporation of a specific NO-binding group, 2-amino-3′-dimethylaminobiphenyl, into a Bodipy dye, fluorescent probe 1 was constructed, which exhibited high selectivity for NO over other ROS/RNS as well as DHA, AA and MGO.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemical reactions 3afluorescent dyes 3anitric oxide 3aphenolic compounds1 aWang, Yue1 aZhang, Song1 aLiu, Yawei1 aZhang, Jian1 aGuo, Wei0 tChemical communications.g2014 June 17, v. 50, no. 56 p.7499-7502dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26910x1364-548X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c4cc03540b3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03033naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001300152245020500165300001600370520132400386592002801710650001501738650002001753650002401773650001201797650001501809650001901824650002501843650001001868650000901878650002001887650003701907650001501944653003601959653003401995653002602029653002102055653002902076653002402105700001602129700005302145700001802198700001602216700001902232700001602251700001502267700001402282773011202296856008602408852000902494655001202503IND60600247220221119070926.0180703e201410  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060024722DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enconman.2014.06.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Chao10aEffects of environmental factors on the conversion efficiency of solar thermoelectric co-generators comprising parabola trough collectors and thermoelectric modules without evacuated tubular collector  ap. 944-951.  aSolar thermoelectric co-generators (STECGs) are an attractive means of supplying electric power and heat simultaneously and economically. Here we examine the effects of environmental factors on the conversion efficiencies of a new type of STECG comprising parabolic trough concentrators and thermoelectric modules (TEMs). Each TEM array was bonded with a solar selective absorber plate and directly positioned on the focal axis of the parabolic concentrator. Glass tubular collectors were not used to encase the TEMs. Although this makes the overall system simpler, the environmental effects become significant. Simulations show that the performance of such a system strongly depends on ambient conditions such as solar insolation, atmospheric temperature and wind velocity. As each of these factors increases, the thermal losses of the STECG system also increase, resulting in reduced solar conversion efficiency, despite the increased radiation absorption. However, the impact of these factors is relatively complicated. Although the electrical efficiency of the system increases with increasing solar insolation, it decreases with increasing ambient temperature and wind velocity. These results serve as a useful guide to the selection and installation of STECGs, particularly in Guangzhou or similar climate region.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3aair temperature 3aambient temperature 3aclimate 3acollectors 3aelectric power 3aenvironmental impact 3aglass 3aheat 3asolar radiation 3atransmission electron microscopy 3awind speed 0aSolar thermoelectric conversion 0aParabolic trough concentrator 0aEnvironmental factors 0aSolar insolation 0aThermal power generation 0aCo-generator system1 aZhang, Ming1 aMiao, Lei1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5984-47591 aZhou, Jianhua1 aKang, Yi Pu1 aFisher, C.A.J.1 aOhno, Kaoru1 aShen, Yang1 aLin, Hong0 tEnergy conversion and management.g2014 Oct., v. 86 p.944-951dElsevier LtdwJournal:11831x0196-89047nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enconman.2014.06.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02791naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100001800154245010800172300001600280520133400296592002801630650003001658650002701688650002201715650001201737650001701749650001001766650001101776650001601787650001901803650001901822650001501841650001401856650003301870650002001903650001401923650001701937650001601954650002101970650001501991700001702006700001702023700001802040700001802058773012302076856008902199852000902288655001202297IND60543398520221120065637.0190410e201412  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054339852DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jphotobiol.2014.10.0142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMahadik, M.A.10aOxidative degradation of industrial wastewater using spray deposited TiO2/Au:Fe2O3 bilayered thin films  ap. 315-324.  aThe Fe2O3, Au:Fe2O3, TiO2/Fe2O3 and TiO2/Au:Fe2O3 thin films are successfully prepared by the spray pyrolysis technique at an optimised substrate temperature of 400°C and 470°C, respectively onto amorphous and F:SnO2 coated glass substrates. The effect of TiO2 layer onto photoelectrochemical (PEC), structural, optical and morphological properties of Fe2O3, Au:Fe2O3, TiO2/Fe2O3 and TiO2/Au:Fe2O3 thin films is studied. The PEC characterization shows that, maximum values of short circuit current (Isc) and open circuit voltage (Voc) are (Isc=185μA and Voc=450mV) are at 38nm thickness of TiO2. Deposited films are polycrystalline with a rhombohedral and anatase crystal structure having (104) preferred orientation. SEM and AFM images show deposited thin films are compact and uniform with seed like grains. The photocatalytic activities of the large surface area (64cm2) TiO2/Au:Fe2O3 thin film photocatalysts were evaluated by photoelectrocatalytic degradation of industrial wastewater under sunlight light irradiation. The results show that the TiO2/Au:Fe2O3 thin film photocatalyst exhibited about 87% and 94% degradation of pollutant in sugarcane and textile industrial wastewater, respectively. The significant reduction in COD and BOD values from 95mg/L to 13mg/L and 75mg/L to 11mg/L, respectively was also observed.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiochemical oxygen demand 3achemical oxygen demand 3acrystal structure 3afabrics 3aferric oxide 3aglass 3agrains 3airradiation 3aphotocatalysis 3aphotocatalysts 3apollutants 3apyrolysis 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asolar radiation 3asugarcane 3asurface area 3atemperature 3atitanium dioxide 3awastewater1 aShinde, S.S.1 aPathan, H.M.1 aRajpure, K.Y.1 aBhosale, C.H.0 tJournal of photochemistry and photobiology.g2014 Dec., v. 141 p.315-324dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6193x1011-13447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jphotobiol.2014.10.0143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02998naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245012800163300001600291520169200307592002801999650002602027650002202053650001702075650001102092650001802103650003502121650001702156650000902173650001102182650001402193650000902207650001802216650001602234650000902250651001002259700002002269700002102289700001902310700001902329773011402348856008102462852000902543655001202552IND60440596020221119170641.0151024e201507  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6044059602DNAL7 a10.1007/s12665-015-4084-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi-qun, Cai10aGIS-based assessment of arable layer pollution of copper (Cu), zinc (Zn) and lead (Pb) in Baiyin District of Gansu Province  ap. 803-811.  aRecently, heavy metal pollution of Baiyin District has become more serious affecting the health of the people and threatening food security. This study was conducted in 2012 to determine the levels of contamination and pollution using geoaccumulation index and potential ecological risk index to evaluate pollution levels of arable layers. Both methods were used to evaluate the risk and determine the present situation of soil heavy metal [copper (Cu), zinc (Zn) and lead (Pb)] pollution characteristics in farmland. This will form the basis for the control of the soil heavy metal pollution, as well as for rational layout of the agricultural industry. Content and spatial distribution of the heavy metals recorded from 1,225 soil samples of arable layer in the study area had average concentration of Cu, Zn and Pb of 36.70, 122.20, and 33.80 mg/kg, respectively. The result shows fluctuating metal concentrations of the heavy metals with Cu, Zn and Pb recording 7.47, 11.07, and 14.46, which are higher than the environmental standard concentrations, respectively. The average pollution of the heavy metals in decreasing order was Pb > Zn > Cu with variation coefficient of 1.92, 2.00, and 2.92, respectively. Evaluation results of Geoaccumulation index show that Cu, Zn, and Pb pollutions of arable layer were mainly concentrated in urban areas, with pollution degree in the order of Pb, Zn, and Cu. Evaluation results of the potential ecological risk index show that the risk of Zn in arable layer is mild, and the risk of Cu and Pb in most of the arable land is also mild, except in surrounding areas of the city where the risk appears medium, and above medium, respectively.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural industry 3aagricultural land 3aarable soils 3acopper 3afood security 3ageographic information systems 3aheavy metals 3alead 3apeople 3apollution 3arisk 3asoil sampling 3aurban areas 3azinc 3aChina1 aYeboah, Stephen1 aCheng-sheng, Sun1 aXiao-dong, Cai1 aRen-zhi, Zhang0 tEnvironmental earth sciences.g2015 July, v. 74, no. 1 p.803-811dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx1866-62807nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12665-015-4084-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01694naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001400150245009600164300001600260520072200276592002800998650001101026650001901037650001601056650002601072700001701098700001601115700001201131700001701143700001901160773009601179856008401275852000901359655001201368IND60113021920221116192032.0141111e20121123xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011302192DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chroma.2012.09.0812doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWu, Haibo10aImprovement of peptoid chiral stationary phases by modifying the terminal group of selector  ap. 181-185.  aThe role of a terminal group of a peptoid selector in a chiral separation was investigated. Six chiral stationary phases (CSPs) with the terminal groups replaced by achiral alkyl groups (n-butyl, t-butyl and diisopropyl) and chiral groups ((1R, 2R)-2-aminocyclohexyl phenylcarbamate, N’-phenyl-L-proline amide and N’-phenyl-L-leucine amide) were synthesized. Achiral terminal groups with different steric hindrances did not broaden the enantioselectivity, but improved the separation factors for some analytes, probably due to the improvement of interactions between the analytes and peptoid chain. Introducing new chiral terminal groups proved an effective way to broaden the applicable spectrum of peptoid CSPs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aamides 3achromatography 3aenantiomers 3aequipment performance1 aSu, Xiaobing1 aLi, Kuiyong1 aYu, Hui1 aKe, Yanxiong1 aLiang, Xinmiao0 tJournal of chromatography.g2012 Nov. 23, v. 1265 p.181-185dElsevier B.V.x0021-96737nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chroma.2012.09.0813Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02691naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245010600167300001600273520139000289592002801679650001301707650001301720650001201733650001301745650001501758650001601773650001701789650002201806650000901828650001401837650003301851650001701884650001301901650001701914650001801931650001001949650000901959651000901968700003001977700002202007773011402029856008102143852000902224655001202233IND60440596120221119170638.0151024e201507  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6044059612DNAL7 a10.1007/s12665-015-4123-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBarzegar, Rahim10aAssessment of heavy metals concentrations with emphasis on arsenic in the Tabriz plain aquifers, Iran  ap. 297-313.  aThe Tabriz area is one of the most industrialized areas in northwest of Iran. The heavy industrialization and the increasing urbanization are responsible for the rapidly increasing stress on the groundwater of the area. The objective of this study was to evaluate heavy metals such as Fe, Mn, Al, Zn, As and Cr in groundwater and their spatial distribution in Tabriz plain aquifer. The concentrations of Fe, Cr, Mn, As, and Al in some of the groundwater samples exceed the maximum admissible concentration (MAC). Correlation matrix (CM) and principal components analysis (PCA) methods were employed to identify source apportionment of contamination parameters in groundwater. There are two types of aquifers, with different quality of water, in the plain; an unconfined aquifer with saline water and a confined aquifer with fresh water quality. Arsenic concentrations in the unconfined aquifer and in the recharge areas of the plain boundary are low, with an average of 25.8 µg/L, while in the confined aquifer and deep wells the concentrations are high, with an average of 122.5 µg/L. The arsenic occurring in groundwater resources of the area originates from geological formations such as alluvial tuffs of Sahand mountain and its concentration is highly dependent on hydrogeological and environmental reducing conditions, residence time of water and depth of the sampling wells.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaluminum 3aaquifers 3aarsenic 3achromium 3afreshwater 3agroundwater 3aheavy metals 3aindustrialization 3airon 3amanganese 3aprincipal component analysis 3asaline water 3asampling 3aurbanization 3awater quality 3awells 3azinc 3aIran1 aAsghari Moghaddam, Asghar1 aKazemian, Naeimeh0 tEnvironmental earth sciences.g2015 July, v. 74, no. 1 p.297-313dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx1866-62807nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12665-015-4123-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02507naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001500140245006200155300002000217520125400237592002801491650002301519650001501542650002101557650002301578650001301601650001901614650001301633650001701646650002501663650001301688650001601701650002101717650002201738700001701760700001701777700001501794700001401809700001501823700001601838773012401854856007401978852000902052655001202061IND60636329720221119113214.0190408e20190329xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063632972DNAL7 a10.1039/c8ra10288k2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFu, Qinghe10aSynthesis and properties of castor oil based plasticizers  ap. 10049-10057.  aA series of environment-friendly plasticizers has been synthesized from castor oil through a mild esterification/epoxidation reaction. The modified epoxy acetylated castor oil (EACO) can plastify poly(vinyl chloride) (PVC) efficiently, even better than the commercial plasticizers dioctyl terephthalate (DOTP) and epoxidized soybean oil (ESO), in terms of in tensile strength, migration stability, solvent extraction stability and thermal stability. Specifically, the tensile strength and elongation at break of a PVC sample plastified by epoxy acetylated castor oil (EACO) were 18.5 and 10.0% higher than that of DOTP, and 13.9 and 23.8% higher than that of ESO, respectively. Volatility, migration, solvent extraction and thermal stability tests indicated that the presence of carbon–carbon double bonds and hydroxy groups reduce the compatibility of a plasticizer with PVC while the presence of epoxy groups and ester bonds can improve the plasticizing effect of the plasticizer on PVC. In addition, alkyl groups can improve the plasticizing effect on PVC while benzene rings increase the rigidity of the PVC. The design strategy based on castor oil highlights a sustainable avenue for preparing cost-effective and high-efficiency plasticizers.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaromatic compounds 3acastor oil 3achemical bonding 3acost effectiveness 3aepoxides 3aesterification 3amoieties 3aplasticizers 3apoly(vinyl chloride) 3asolvents 3asoybean oil 3atensile strength 3athermal stability1 aLong, Yilang1 aGao, Yingyun1 aLing, Yuan1 aQian, Hao1 aWang, Fang1 aZhu, Xinbao0 tRSC advances.g2019 Mar. 29, v. 9, no. 18 p.10049-10057dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c8ra10288k3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03356naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094024002200121024001900143040001800162100002400180245015900204300001800363506007600381520185000457592002802307506003702335650001902372650001102391650003102402650001702433650001102450650001102461650002302472650002202495650002002517650002002537650001502557650003302572650002602605650001102631650001702642700001902659700002102678773010302699856007502802852000902877655001202886IND60531001620221207084440.0160723e20121002xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053100162DNAL7 a10.1021/bi300833z2doi7 aPMC34624742pmcid7 a229504822pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKhelashvili, George10aPhosphatidylinositol 4,5-Biphosphate (PIP2) Lipids Regulate the Phosphorylation of Syntaxin N-Terminus by Modulating Both Its Position and Local Structure  ap. 7685-7698.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aSyntaxin (STX) is a N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor (SNARE) protein that binds to the plasma membrane and regulates ion channels and neurotransmitter transporters. Experiments have established the involvement of the N-terminal segment of STX in direct protein–protein interactions and have suggested a critical role for the phosphorylation of serine 14 (S14) by casein kinase-2 (CK2). Because the organization of STX in the plasma membrane was shown to be regulated by phosphatidylinositol 4,5-biphosphate (PIP₂) lipids, we investigated the mechanistic involvement of PIP₂ lipids in modulating both the membrane interaction and the phosphorylation of STX, using a computational strategy that integrates mesoscale continuum modeling of protein–membrane interactions, with all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Iterative applications of this protocol produced quantitative evaluations of lipid-type demixing due to the protein and identified conformational differences between STX immersed in PIP₂-containing and PIP₂-depleted membranes. Specific sites in STX were identified to be important for the electrostatic interactions with the PIP₂ lipids attracted to the protein, and the segregation of PIP₂ lipids near the protein is shown to have a dramatic effect on the positioning of the STX N-terminal segment with respect to the membrane/water interface. This PIP₂-dependent repositioning is shown to modulate the extent of exposure of S14 to large reagents representing the CK2 enzyme and hence the propensity for phosphorylation. The prediction of STX sites involved in such PIP₂-dependent regulation of STX phosphorylation at S14 offers experimentally testable probes of the mechanisms and models presented in this study, through structural modifications that can modulate the effects.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aSNARE proteins 3acasein 3aelectrostatic interactions 3aion channels 3alipids 3amodels 3amolecular dynamics 3aneurotransmitters 3aphosphorylation 3aplasma membrane 3aprediction 3aprotein-protein interactions 3aquantitative analysis 3aserine 3atransporters1 aGalli, Aurelio1 aWeinstein, Harel0 tBiochemistry.g2012 Oct. 02, v. 51, no. 39 p.7685-7698dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-49957nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fbi300833z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03216naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245013300169500001900302520156700321592002801888650002001916650002501936650002001961650001101981650002101992650002202013650002202035650000902057650001402066650001802080650001802098650001502116650001802131650001902149650002502168650001402193650001702207651000902224653002902233653001502262653001302277700005402290700001802344700002702362700002102389700006402410773011702474856008602591852000902677655001202686IND60713974220221120080638.0210114e20201215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071397422DNAL7 a10.1016/j.indcrop.2020.1129502doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShams, Rezvan10aGenetic structure and diversity of Iranian Cannabis populations based on phytochemical, agro-morphological and molecular markers  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aHemp (Cannabis sativa) is an herbaceous, annual, and dioecious plant belongs to the Cannabaceae family and grows in some parts of Iran. In the present study, the genetic diversity between and within the populations of 10 local cultivated landraces from Iran was evaluated, using multiple datasets (agro-morphological and biochemical traits, seed oil fatty acid compositions, and ISSR (Inter simple sequence repeats) markers. The analysis of variance based on the morpho-biochemical traits and oil compositions indicated significant differences among studied hemp populations (P < 0.01). Of the identified fatty acids, linoleic acid (53.02 %), α-linolenic acid (18.98 %), oleic acid (15.20 %), palmitic acid (6.61 %), and stearic acid (2.96 %) composed 77.79 % of total seed oil content. The content of major fatty acids varied greatly among the populations. Kermanshah had the highest proportion of linoleic acid (54.03 %), Hamedan; α-linolenic acid (21.47 %), Alborz; oleic acid (16.75 %), Kohkylouih-and-Boyerahmad; palmitic acid (6.82 %), and Khuzestan; stearic acid (3.23 %). In this study, 14 ISSR primers, produced 231 high-resolution bands, of which 198 (85 %) were polymorphic. Population structure inference showed that the hemp single plants in populations were distributed into six genetic clusters that were matched with UPGMA clusters. The results showed that the highest genetic distance was observed between Kerman and Markazi populations. The findings of this study can be used in future programs for the breeding of Iranian hemp landraces.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCannabis sativa 3aanalysis of variance 3adata collection 3adioecy 3agenetic distance 3agenetic structure 3agenetic variation 3ahemp 3alandraces 3alinoleic acid 3alipid content 3aoleic acid 3apalmitic acid 3aphytochemicals 3apopulation structure 3aseed oils 3astearic acid 3aIran 0aMarker-trait association 0aMorphology 0aSeed oil1 aAzizi, Ali1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4089-77351 aHamzei, Javad1 aNoroozisharaf, Alireza1 aMoghadam, Shoeib1 aKordrostami, Mojtaba1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0314-13540 tIndustrial crops and products.g2020 Dec. 15, v. 158 p.112950-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl49222x0926-66907nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.indcrop.2020.1129503Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02553naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100002400154245012300178300001600301520129600317592002801613650003101641650001401672650001801686650001801704650002501722650001001747650001701757700002701774700003401801700002201835700001701857700002401874700002401898700002401922773012301946856008902069852000902158655001202167IND60543398820221120080902.0190410e201412  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054339882DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jphotobiol.2014.10.0172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aQueiroz, Adriana C.10aAntimicrobial photodynamic therapy associated to nonsurgical periodontal treatment in smokers: Microbiological results  ap. 170-175.  aStudies suggest that smokers present more or greater numbers of potential periodontal pathogens than non-smokers. The aim of this study was to investigate the microbiologic effects of adjunctive aPDT on nonsurgical periodontal treatment in smokers with chronic periodontitis (CP).Twenty smokers with CP had two contralateral teeth randomly assigned in a split-mouth design to receive SRP (CG) or SRP+a single episode of aPDT (TG), with a diode laser and a phenothiazine photosensitizer. Levels of 40 subgingival species were measured using checkerboard DNA–DNA hybridization at baseline and 1, 4 and 12weeks after periodontal treatment.All 40 bacterial species evaluated were detected in different levels at baseline, with no statistic significant differences between groups. After periodontal treatment, the levels of some bacterial species decreased, while some other species presented an increase. Despite this variation, the statistical analysis was not able to identify significant differences neither at intragroup nor at intergroup comparisons.Periodontal treatment with SRP or SRP+aPDT was not able to reduce levels of 40 subgingival species in smokers with CP. These outcomes indicate that smoking impairs periodontal healing after nonsurgical treatment even associated with aPDT.  aPublisher supplied data 3anucleic acid hybridization 3apathogens 3aperiodontitis 3aphenothiazine 3astatistical analysis 3ateeth 3atherapeutics1 aSuaid, Flávia Adelino1 ade Andrade, Patrícia Freitas1 aNovaes, Arthur B.1 aTaba, Mário1 aPalioto, Daniela B.1 aGrisi, Márcio F.M.1 aSouza, Sérgio L.S.0 tJournal of photochemistry and photobiology.g2014 Dec., v. 141 p.170-175dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6193x1011-13447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jphotobiol.2014.10.0173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02828naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001500139245012100154300001800275500001500293520145000308592002801758650001901786650001401805650001201819650001701831650002501848650003001873650001701903650002601920650001901946650001201965650003001977650002602007650001502033650001502048650001202063650002002075650002602095653001402121700002102135700001902156773010102175856007302276852000902349655001202358IND60459363320221120232743.0151109e201512  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6045936332DNAL7 a10.1111/gcb.129652doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHines, Jes10aInter‐annual changes in detritus‐based food chains can enhance plant growth response to elevated atmospheric CO2  ap. 4642-4650.  a2019-12-06  aElevated atmospheric CO₂ generally enhances plant growth, but the magnitude of the effects depend, in part, on nutrient availability and plant photosynthetic pathway. Due to their pivotal role in nutrient cycling, changes in abundance of detritivores could influence the effects of elevated atmospheric CO₂ on essential ecosystem processes, such as decomposition and primary production. We conducted a field survey and a microcosm experiment to test the influence of changes in detritus‐based food chains on litter mass loss and plant growth response to elevated atmospheric CO₂ using two wetland plants: a C₃ sedge (Scirpus olneyi) and a C₄ grass (Spartina patens). Our field study revealed that organism's sensitivity to climate increased with trophic level resulting in strong inter‐annual variation in detritus‐based food chain length. Our microcosm experiment demonstrated that increased detritivore abundance could not only enhance decomposition rates, but also enhance plant growth of S. olneyi in elevated atmospheric CO₂ conditions. In contrast, we found no evidence that changes in the detritus‐based food chains influenced the growth of S. patens. Considered together, these results emphasize the importance of approaches that unite traditionally subdivided food web compartments and plant physiological processes to understand inter‐annual variation in plant production response to elevated atmospheric CO₂.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon dioxide 3aC4 plants 3agrasses 3aplant growth 3aprimary productivity 3acarbon dioxide enrichment 3adetritivores 3anutrient availability 3awetland plants 3asurveys 3aSchoenoplectus americanus 3afield experimentation 3aecosystems 3afood chain 3aclimate 3aSpartina patens 3abiogeochemical cycles 0afood webs1 aEisenhauer, Nico1 aDrake, Bert G.0 tGlobal change biology.g2015 Dec., v. 21, no. 12 p.4642-4650dBlackwell Sciencex1354-10137nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/gcb.129653Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03591naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001400148245015700162300001600319520189900335592002802234650001102262650002102273650002102294650001402315650001602329650001002345650001702355650002402372650001002396650002302406650001202429650002102441650001802462650001302480650001602493650002502509650001402534650000902548650002002557650002002577650001302597653001902610653001902629653001602648653000902664653002102673653001002694700001802704700001302722700001302735700001502748773014602763856008302909852000902992655001203001IND60625053720221117170033.0190129e20190115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062505372DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbrc.2018.12.0202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Yan10aConstant light exposure aggravates POMC-mediated muscle wasting associated with hypothalamic alteration of circadian clock and SIRT1 in endotoxemia rats  ap. 811-817.  aConstant light exposure is widespread in the intensive care unit (ICU) and could increase the rate of brain dysfunction as delirium and sleep disorders in critical patients. And the activation of hypothalamic neuropeptides is proved to play a crucial role in regulating hypercatabolism, especially skeletal muscle wasting in critical patients, which could lead to serious complications and poor prognosis. Here we investigated the hypothesis that constant light exposure could aggravate skeletal muscle wasting in endotoxemia rats and whether it was associated with alterations of circadian clock and hypothalamic proopiomelanocortin(POMC) expression. Fifty-four adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were intraperitoneally injected with lipopolysaccharide(LPS) or saline, subjected to constant light or a 12:12 h light-dark cycle for 7 days. On day 8, rats were sacrificed across six time points in 24 h and hypothalamus tissues and skeletal muscle were obtained. Rates of muscle wasting were measured by 3-methylhistidine(3-MH) and tyrosine release as well as expression of two muscle atrophic genes, muscle ring finger 1(MuRF-1) and muscle atrophy F-box(MAFbx). The expression of circadian clock genes, silent information regulator 1(SIRT1), POMC and hypothalamic inflammatory cytokines were also detected. Results showed that LPS administration significantly increased hypothalamic POMC expression, inflammatory cytokine levels and muscle wasting rates. Meanwhile constant light exposure disrupted the circadian rhythm, declined the expression of SIRT1 as well as aggravated hypothalamic POMC overexpression and skeletal muscle wasting in rats with endotoxemia. Taken together, the results demonstrated that constant light exposure could aggravate POMC-mediated skeletal muscle wasting in endotoxemia rats, which is associated with alteration of circadian clocks and SIRT1 in the hypothalamus.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadults 3acircadian clocks 3acircadian rhythm 3acytokines 3aendotoxemia 3agenes 3ahypothalamus 3alipopolysaccharides 3amales 3ametabolic diseases 3amuscles 3amuscular atrophy 3aneuropeptides 3apatients 3aphotoperiod 3apro-opiomelanocortin 3aprognosis 3arats 3askeletal muscle 3asleep disorders 3atyrosine 0aConstant light 0aMuscle wasting 0aEndotoxemia 0aPOMC 0aCircadian rhythm 0aSIRT11 aCheng, Minhua1 aSu, Ting1 aGao, Tao1 aYu, Wenkui0 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2019 Jan. 15, v. 508, no. 3 p.811-817dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl46848x0006-291X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2018.12.0203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02657naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100003300140245009300173300002000266500001900286520142500305592002801730650003501758650001301793650001701806650002201823650002001845650001301865650001601878650001601894700002801910700002401938700003201962700004101994700002902035773012402064856007402188852000902262655001202271IND60738199120221118051212.0210521e20210518xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073819912DNAL7 a10.1039/d1ra01066b2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSantos, Willian Henrique dos10aDevelopment of a caffeic acid–phthalimide hybrid compound for NADPH oxidase inhibition  ap. 17880-17890.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aNADPH oxidases are pharmacological targets for the treatment of inflammation-based diseases. This work presents the synthesis and study of a caffeic acid/phthalimide hybrid compound (C2) as a potential inhibitor of NADPH oxidases. Throughout the study, we have compared compound C2 with its precursor caffeic acid (C1). The redox properties were compared using three different antioxidant methodologies and showed that C2 was slightly less effective than C1, a well-established and robust antioxidant. However, C2 was three-fold more effective than albumin (used as a model protein). This chemical feature was decisive for the higher efficiency of C2 as an inhibitor of the release of superoxide anions by stimulated neutrophils and enzymatic activity of cell-free NADPH oxidase. Docking simulation studies were performed using the crystal structure of the recombinant dehydrogenase domain of the isoform NOX5 of C. stagnale, which retains the FAD cofactor (PDB: 5O0X). Considering that C2 could bind at the FAD redox site of NOX5, studies were conducted by comparing the interactions and binding energies of C1 and C2. The binding energies were −50.30 (C1) and −74.88 (C2) (kJ mol⁻¹), which is in agreement with the higher efficacy of the latter as an NADPH oxidase inhibitor. In conclusion, incorporating the phthalimide moiety into caffeic acid was decisive for its effectiveness as an NADPH oxidase inhibitor.  aPublisher supplied data 3aNAD(P)H oxidase (H2O2-forming) 3aalbumins 3acaffeic acid 3acrystal structure 3aenzyme activity 3amoieties 3aneutrophils 3aphthalimide1 aYoguim, Maurício Ikeda1 aDaré, Regina Gomes1 ada Silva-Filho, Luiz Carlos1 aLautenschlager, Sueli Oliveira Silva1 aXimenes, Valdecir Farias0 tRSC advances.g2021 May 18, v. 11, no. 29 p.17880-17890dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d1ra01066b3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03200naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245011300166300001400279520160700293592002801900650001801928650002101946650001001967650002501977650001102002650002502013650001802038650001102056650001902067650001302086650001402099650001402113650002202127650004302149650002402192650001202216650005202228653001002280653002202290653002502312653001402337700001302351700001802364700001702382700001802399700001302417700001802430773011902448856008202567852000902649655001202658IND60533280120221117173727.0160728e20151204xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053328012DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbrc.2015.10.1662doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Chenchen10aElevated expression of Thoc1 is associated with aggressive phenotype and poor prognosis in colorectal cancer  ap. 53-58.  aThe THO complex 1 (Thoc1) is a nuclear matrix protein playing vital roles in transcription elongation and mRNA export. Recently, aberrant expression of Thoc1 has been reported in an increasing array of tumor types. However, the clinical significance of Thoc1 expression in colorectal cancer (CRC) is still unknown. The present study aimed to characterize the expression of Thoc1 in human CRC and evaluate its clinical significance. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and Western blotting analyses showed that the mRNA and protein expression of Thoc1 in CRC specimens was significantly higher than that in adjacent normal colon mucosae. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) was conducted to characterize the expression pattern of Thoc1 in 185 archived paraffin-embedded CRC specimens. Statistical analyses revealed that high levels of Thoc1 expression were associated with the clinical stages and tumor differentiation. CRC patients with high levels of Thoc1 expression had poorer overall-survival and disease-free survival, whereas those with lower levels of Thoc1 expression survived longer. Furthermore, multivariate Cox regression analyses demonstrated that Thoc1 expression remained an independent prognostic factor for increased disease recurrence and decreased survival. Our results suggest for the first time that Thoc1 is involved in the development and progression of CRC, and elevated expression of Thoc1 is associated with aggressive phenotype and poor prognosis in CRC. These findings may prove to be clinically useful for developing a new therapeutic target of CRC treatment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRNA transport 3aWestern blotting 3acolon 3acolorectal neoplasms 3ahumans 3aimmunohistochemistry 3amessenger RNA 3amucosa 3anuclear matrix 3apatients 3aphenotype 3aprognosis 3aprotein synthesis 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3aregression analysis 3arelapse 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 0aThoc1 0aColorectal cancer 0aAggressive phenotype 0aPrognosis1 aYue, Ben1 aYuan, Chenwei1 aZhao, Senlin1 aFang, Changyi1 aYu, Yang1 aYan, Dongwang0 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2015 Dec. 04, v. 468 p.53-58dElsevier Inc.x0006-291X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2015.10.1663Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02143naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245004700165300001400212520107700226592002801303650002901331650001301360650002001373650001101393650001101404650001601415650001101431650001101442650001501453650001501468650002001483650001701503651001201520700002301532773011201555856008101667852000901748655001201757IND60440596720221119170615.0151024e201507  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6044059672DNAL7 a10.1007/s12665-015-4309-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEftimi, Romeo10aHuman impacts on Karst aquifers of Albania  ap. 57-70.  aAlbania is situated in the western part of the Balkan Peninsula, on the eastern coast of the Adriatic and the Ionian Sea. The karst landscape in Albania covers about 6750 km², approximately 24 % of the Albanian territory. There are 25 karst regions in the country, 23 in carbonate rocks and 2 in evaporites. The total renewable karst water resources are estimated about 227 m³/s, representing 80 % of the groundwater resources of Albania. About 70 % of the population of the cities, including also part of the capital Tirana, obtains the water from karst springs. However, the negative human impacts often are threatening the karst groundwater resources of Albania. Several bad experiences in Albania have demonstrated that the main human negative impacts on karst water are related to: (a) urbanised areas, (b) agriculture activities, and (c) quarrying activities. Understanding the vital importance of karst waters and the necessity for intensive scientific investigations and monitoring, to evidence their high vulnerability, are still at a low level in Albania.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanthropogenic activities 3aaquifers 3acarbonate rocks 3acities 3acoasts 3agroundwater 3ahumans 3akarsts 3alandscapes 3amonitoring 3asprings (water) 3aurbanization 3aAlbania1 aZojer, H.q(Hans),0 tEnvironmental earth sciences.g2015 July, v. 74, no. 1 p.57-70dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx1866-62807nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12665-015-4309-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02051naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001800152245012800170500001400298520079700312592002801109650001501137650001101152650000901163650001901172650001201191650001301203650000901216650001701225653001201242653000801254653001701262653004001279653000801319653000801327700001801335700001901353700006101372773010001433856008701533852000901620655001201629IND60700779020221121183924.0200913e20210101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070077902DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2020.1274362doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMohamed, Huda10aUse of near and mid infra-red spectroscopy for analysis of protein, fat, lactose and total solids in raw cow and camel milk  aNAL-light  aMilk samples (150 cow and 217 camel milk samples) were analyzed for protein, fat, lactose and total solids by near and mid-infrared transmission spectroscopy.

Among the innumerable beverage industries, wineries have received increasing attention and consideration due to various health related benefits and involvement of agricultural materials. Winery industry produces huge quantities of waste materials in the form of solid and liquid wastes. Disposal of these residues (wastes) in the environement is a serious concern and has attracted increasing R&D efforts for their utilization in sustainable manner. Several existing treatments available for winery wastes not environmental-friendly and are even expensive. Usually, combined or hydrid treatment methods have been advocated to achieve the complete utilization of these wastes and among these, bio-based treatment processes have been in much focus for attaining environmental suutaibility in particular. Accordinglt, this review mainly focuses on the application of biorefinery concept for sustainable winery waste management as it is expected that such bioprocesses would be of great impliactions for bioeconomy with furture developments. The review also highlights the advanced techniques for the bioconversion of winery wastes and articulates the major associated challenges.  aPublisher supplied data 3abeverages 3abioeconomics 3abiorefining 3abiotransformation 3ahuman population 3alifestyle 3aliquids 3avalue added 3awaste management 3awine industry 0aWinery industry waste 0aBiorefinery 0aValue-added products 0aFermentation 0aCircular bioeconomy1 aIyyappan, J.1 aJayamuthunagai, J.1 aKumar, R.

The increase in mean net profit with mean milk receipts and the decrease with mean expenditure on chemical fertilisers imply that increasing milk receipts while optimising the use of chemical fertiliser input can be an effective strategy to increase net profit. Mean net profit was not directly related to mean N and P balances or N and P use efficiencies. However, there was an indirect link between net profit and N and P use efficiencies, as indicated through significant relationships between N and P use in the form of chemical fertilisers and feeds and the associated expenditures on chemical fertilisers and feeds. The increase of mean expenditure on feeds (concentrate, forages) with mean SR (stocking rate) and feed N input highlights the importance of matching SR with the feed imports on grass-based dairy farms, when there is limited availability of grassland area. This can be an effective strategy to control expenditure on feeds, with potential positive impact on net profit. Results of the sensitivity analysis indicated that milk price was the main driver for changes in net profit in high and low milk price situations investigated across nine price scenarios. The decrease in mean (51.4 l/kg N) N-eco-efficiency (milk produced per kilogram N balance) with mean fertiliser N input (190 kg N/ha) implies that efficient on-farm N management is needed to achieve increases in milk production and reduce N balance per unit product (litre milk). Potential fertiliser N replacement values of €317/ha for the spring and €64/ha for summer slurry application may represent strong incentives for farmers to make increased use of organic fertilisers, as part of overall on-farm N management. This can have positive impacts on farm nutrient use efficiency and farm net profit. Eight farms exceeding the limit of 2 livestock units (LU)/ha, imposed through the Nitrates Directive, had 1.63 times higher net profit compared with the remainder, which justified the cost of compliance associated with being in derogation. The results of this study generally indicate that Irish dairy farms, as low-input production systems, have the potential to improve both economic (as indicated by net profit per hectare) and environmental (as indicated by N and P balances per hectare, N and P use efficiencies and N-eco-efficiency) sustainability.  aPublisher supplied data 3acompliance 3adairy farming 3aeconomic impact 3afarmers 3afarms 3afeeds 3aforage 3agrasslands 3aimports 3alivestock 3amilk 3amilk prices 3amilk production 3anitrates 3anitrogen 3anitrogen fertilizers 3anutrient use efficiency 3aorganic fertilizers 3aphosphorus 3aproduction technology 3aslurries 3aspring 3astocking rate 3asummer 3aIreland 0aDairy farm 0aNitrogen 0aPhosphorus 0aEfficiency 0aSensitivity 0aNitrate Directive1 aRyan, W.1 aMurphy, P.N.C.1 aCasey, I.A.1 aHumphreys, J.0 tAgricultural systems.g2015 Jan., v. 132 p.121-132dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl7186x0308-521X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agsy.2014.09.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02954naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002100152245013600173300001600309500001900325520169200344592002802036650002202064650001802086650001702104650001702121650001802138650001702156650002302173650001102196650001702207700002702224700001602251700001702267700001602284700002002300773014102320856008602461852000902547655001202556IND60694300920221119213254.0200511e20050101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069430092DNAL7 a10.1080/14620316.2005.115119252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCameron, R.W.

In some woody species, the period in which cuttings can be rooted successfully is transient, thus limiting the opportunities for scheduled production. Optimum rooting often occurs in early- to mid-summer coinciding with periods of active shoot growth. The relationship between this shoot activity and root initiation was investigated in Cotinus coggygria ‘Royal Purple’. Shoot growth on stock plants was manipulated by altering the photoperiod or light quality. Results indicated there were seasonal effects on rooting, but the importance of shoot activity varied with harvest time. Cuttings harvested in August had high rooting percentages, irrespective of photoperiod, and despite shoot growth terminating in response to the short-day treatment. In contrast, by September, rooting percentage was highest in cuttings from plants under long-days, which had maintained greatest shoot growth activity. Cotinus shoots grown in vitro under 16 h days showed reduced shoot growth and increased rooting competence compared with shoots grown under 8 h days. Growing stock plants under polythene films, which altered the amount and quality of the incident light, influenced the rooting of cuttings harvested in August, but no consistent relationship with shoot activity was apparent. From a practical viewpoint, maintaining shoot activity late in the season may prolong the period for propagation by cuttings; but, from a scientific viewpoint, processes associated with an active shoot apex do not provide a complete explanation of seasonal variation in rooting.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCotinus coggygria 3abiotechnology 3aharvest date 3ahorticulture 3alight quality 3aplant growth 3aseasonal variation 3asummer 3awoody plants1 aHarrison-Murray, R.

The adsorption of 12-aminododecanoic acid (ADA) and 12-mercaptododecanoic acid (ADA) to TiO₂ followed the Langmuir adsorption isotherm. Surface adduct formation constants (Kₐd) were ∼10⁴ M–¹; saturation amounts of the ligands per projected surface area of TiO₂ (Γ₀) were ∼10–⁷ mol cm–². Both Kₐd and Γ₀ differed by 20% or less for the two linkers. CdSe QDs adhered to ADA- and MDA-functionalized TiO₂ films; data were well modeled by the Langmuir adsorption isotherm and Langmuir kinetics. For ADA- and MDA-mediated assembly values of Kₐd were (1.8 ± 0.4) × 10⁶ and (2.4 ± 0.4) × 10⁶ M–¹, values of Γ₀ were (1.6 ± 0.3) × 10–⁹ and (1.2 ± 0.1) × 10–⁹ mol cm–², and rate constants were (14 ± 5) and (60 ± 20) M–¹ s–¹, respectively. Thus, the thermodynamics and kinetics of linker-assisted assembly were slightly more favorable for MDA than for ADA. Steady-state and time-resolved emission spectroscopy revealed that electrons were transferred from both band-edge and surface states of CdSe QDs to TiO₂ with rate constants (kₑₜ) of ∼10⁷ s–¹. ET was approximately twice as fast through thiol-bearing linker 4-mercaptobutyric acid (MBA) as through amine-bearing linker 4-aminobutyric acid (ABA). Photoexcited QDs transferred holes to adsorbed MBA. In contrast, ABA did not scavenge photogenerated holes from CdSe QDs, which maximized the separation of charges following ET. Additionally, ABA shifted electron-trapping surface states to higher energies, minimizing the loss of potential energy of electrons prior to ET. These trade-offs involving the kinetics and thermodynamics of linker-assisted assembly; the driving force, rate constant, and efficiency of ET; and the extent of photoinduced charge separation can inform the selection bifunctional ligands to tether QDs to surfaces.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3aelectron transfer 3aelectrons 3aenergy 3aligands 3ananocrystals 3ananoparticles 3aquantum dots 3asorption isotherms 3aspectroscopy 3asurface area 3athermodynamics 3atitanium dioxide1 aChauhan, Saurabh1 aWatson, David F.0 tLangmuir.g2016 Sept. 13, v. 32, no. 36 p.9206-9215dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-58277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.langmuir.6b027043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03645naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002400139245009400163300001800257500001500275520212400290592002802414650002102442650001502463650001102478650001102489650001702500650001202517650002602529650002002555650001602575650001302591650000802604650001502612650002402627650001802651650001402669650001902683650001202702650002002714650002202734650001802756650001502774650001302789650001202802650001902814650001202833651001102845653001902856700002102875773010102896856007302997852000903070655001203079IND60459363820221120221207.0151109e201512  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6045936382DNAL7 a10.1111/gcb.130692doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAbbott, Benjamin W.10aPermafrost collapse alters soil carbon stocks, respiration, CH4, and N2O in upland tundra  ap. 4570-4587.  a2019-12-06  aRelease of greenhouse gases from thawing permafrost is potentially the largest terrestrial feedback to climate change and one of the most likely to occur; however, estimates of its strength vary by a factor of thirty. Some of this uncertainty stems from abrupt thaw processes known as thermokarst (permafrost collapse due to ground ice melt), which alter controls on carbon and nitrogen cycling and expose organic matter from meters below the surface. Thermokarst may affect 20–50% of tundra uplands by the end of the century; however, little is known about the effect of different thermokarst morphologies on carbon and nitrogen release. We measured soil organic matter displacement, ecosystem respiration, and soil gas concentrations at 26 upland thermokarst features on the North Slope of Alaska. Features included the three most common upland thermokarst morphologies: active‐layer detachment slides, thermo‐erosion gullies, and retrogressive thaw slumps. We found that thermokarst morphology interacted with landscape parameters to determine both the initial displacement of organic matter and subsequent carbon and nitrogen cycling. The large proportion of ecosystem carbon exported off‐site by slumps and slides resulted in decreased ecosystem respiration postfailure, while gullies removed a smaller portion of ecosystem carbon but strongly increased respiration and N₂O concentration. Elevated N₂O in gully soils persisted through most of the growing season, indicating sustained nitrification and denitrification in disturbed soils, representing a potential noncarbon permafrost climate feedback. While upland thermokarst formation did not substantially alter redox conditions within features, it redistributed organic matter into both oxic and anoxic environments. Across morphologies, residual organic matter cover, and predisturbance respiration explained 83% of the variation in respiration response. Consistent differences between upland thermokarst types may contribute to the incorporation of this nonlinear process into projections of carbon and nitrogen release from degrading permafrost.  aPublisher supplied data 3agreenhouse gases 3apermafrost 3atundra 3acarbon 3acarbon sinks 3amelting 3aecosystem respiration 3adisturbed soils 3auncertainty 3asoil air 3aice 3aecosystems 3asoil organic matter 3anitrification 3ahighlands 3aclimate change 3aravines 3adenitrification 3atopographic slope 3anitrous oxide 3alandscapes 3anitrogen 3amethane 3agrowing season 3athawing 3aAlaska 0aorganic matter1 aJones, Jeremy B.0 tGlobal change biology.g2015 Dec., v. 21, no. 12 p.4570-4587dBlackwell Sciencex1354-10137nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/gcb.130693Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02691naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002500150245013900175300001400314520133400328592002801662650001901690650001401709650001501723650002301738650001501761650003301776650001301809650001301822650003701835650000901872650001801881650001301899650001201912650001601924700002101940700002801961700002001989700002002009700002902029773009402058856008402152852000902236655001202245IND60113022520221116191810.0141111e20121123xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011302252DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chroma.2012.09.0992doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHosseini, Majid Haji10aDetermination of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in soil samples using flotation-assisted homogeneous liquid–liquid microextraction  ap. 52-56.  aIn this study, flotation-assisted homogeneous liquid–liquid microextraction (FA-HLLME) was developed as a fast, simple, and efficient method for extraction of four polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in soil samples followed by gas chromatography-flame ionization detector (GC-FID) analysis. A special home-made extraction cell was designed to facilitate collection of the low-density extraction solvent without a need for centrifugation. In this method, PAHs were extracted from soil samples into methanol and water (1:1, v/v) using ultrasound in two steps followed by filtration as a clean-up step. The filtrate was added into the home-made extraction cell contained mixture of 1.0mL methanol (homogenous solvent) and 150.0μL toluene (extraction solvent). Using N₂ flotation, the dispersed extraction solvent was transferred to the surface of the mixture and was collected by means of a micro-syringe. Then, 2μL of the collected organic solvent was injected into the GC-FID for subsequent analysis. Under optimal conditions, linearity of the method was in the range of 40–1000μgkg⁻¹ soil (dry weight). The relative standard deviations in real samples varied from 5.9 to 15.2% (n=4). The proposed method was successfully applied to analyze the target PAHs in soil samples, and satisfactory results were obtained.  aPublisher supplied data 3acentrifugation 3afiltrates 3afiltration 3agas chromatography 3aionization 3aliquid-phase microextraction 3amethanol 3anitrogen 3apolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons 3asoil 3asoil sampling 3asolvents 3atoluene 3aultrasonics1 aRezaee, Mohammad1 aMashayekhi, Hossein Ali1 aAkbarian, Saeid1 aMizani, Farhang1 aPourjavid, Mohammad Reza0 tJournal of chromatography.g2012 Nov. 23, v. 1265 p.52-56dElsevier B.V.x0021-96737nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chroma.2012.09.0993Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02923naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001600148245013300164300001600297520144000313592002801753650001001781650001401791650001401805650002501819650001601844650002101860650001501881650001201896650001301908650002601921650001801947650002901965650002601994650003102020653003102051653002802082653000802110653002502118700001502143700001502158700001702173700001302190773014602203856008302349852000902432655001202441IND60625054120221120165030.0190129e20190212xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062505412DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbrc.2018.12.0242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDing, Yuhua10aMegakaryocytic leukemia 1 (MKL1) mediates high glucose induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition by activating LOX transcription  ap. 633-640.  aDiabetic retinopathy (DR) is one of the most devastating complications of diabetes mellitus. When exposed to high glucose (HG), retinal epithelial cells undergo profound alterations both morphologically and functionally in a well-conserved process known as epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). The mechanism governing HG-induced EMT in retinal epithelial cells is not completely understood. Here we report that treatment with 25 mM glucose led to EMT in retinal pigmented epithelial cells (RPE) characterized by a simultaneous down-regulation of E-Cadherin (encoded by CDH1) and up-regulation of alpha smooth muscle actin (encoded by ACTA2). HG-induced EMT in RPEs was accompanied by augmented expression and enhanced nuclear enrichment of MKL1, a transcriptional modulator. In contrast, MKL1 knockdown by siRNA or inhibition by CCG-1423 abrogated HG-induced EMT in RPEs. Of interest, MKL1 mediated the transcriptional activation of LOX, a mesenchymal marker, in RPEs in response to HG stimulation. Mechanistically, MKL1 interacted with and was recruited by AP-1 to the proximal LOX promoter to promote LOX trans-activation likely through altering the chromatin structure. Finally, LOX depletion by siRNA or inhibition by aminopropionitrile in RPEs abolished HG-induced EMT. In conclusion, our data support a role for MKL1 in mediating HG-induced EMT in retinal epithelial cells via epigenetic activation of LOX transcription.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactin 3acadherins 3achromatin 3adiabetic retinopathy 3aepigenetics 3aepithelial cells 3aepithelium 3aglucose 3aleukemia 3asmall interfering RNA 3asmooth muscle 3atranscription (genetics) 3atranscription factors 3atranscriptional activation 0aTranscriptional regulation 0aRetinal epithelial cell 0aEMT 0aDiabetic retinopathy1 aXu, Huihui1 aLi, Luyang1 aYuan, Yibiao1 aXu, Yong0 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2019 Feb. 12, v. 509, no. 3 p.633-640dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl46848x0006-291X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2018.12.0243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02395naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245013100165300001600296520129600312592002801608650001301636650001901649650001601668650002201684650000901706650001301715650002401728650001401752650002101766651001001787700001601797700001601813773011401829856008101943852000902024655001202033IND60440597020221119170741.0151024e201507  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6044059702DNAL7 a10.1007/s12665-015-4423-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRomanazzi, A.10aModelling and management of a Mediterranean karstic coastal aquifer under the effects of seawater intrusion and climate change  ap. 115-128.  aThe study and management of the groundwater resources of a large, deep, coastal, karstic aquifer represent a very complex hydrogeological problem. Here, this problem is successfully approached by using an equivalent porous continuous medium (EPCM) to represent a karstic Apulian aquifer (southern Italy). This aquifer, which is located on a peninsula and extends to hundreds of metres depth, is the sole local source of high-quality water resources. These resources are at risk due to overexploitation, climate change and seawater intrusion. The model was based on MODFLOW and SEAWAT codes. Piezometric and salinity variations from 1930 to 2060 were simulated under three past scenarios (up to 1999) and three future scenarios that consider climate change, different types of discharge, and changes in sea level and salinity. The model was validated using surveyed piezometric and salinity data. An evident piezometric drop was confirmed for the past period (until 1999); a similar dramatic drop appears to be likely in the future. The lateral intrusion and upconing effects of seawater intrusion were non-negligible in the past and will be considerable in the future. All phenomena considered here, including sea level and sea salinity, showed non-negligible effects on coastal groundwater.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaquifers 3aclimate change 3agroundwater 3ahydrologic models 3arisk 3asalinity 3asaltwater intrusion 3asea level 3awater management 3aItaly1 aGentile, F.1 aPolemio, M.0 tEnvironmental earth sciences.g2015 July, v. 74, no. 1 p.115-128dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx1866-62807nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12665-015-4423-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02558naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002200151245008800173300001400261500001900275520111600294592002801410596007001438596004001508650002101548650001801569650001301587650001401600650001501614650001501629650001601644650001301660650001401673650001301687653002501700653001801725653001201743700001901755700002301774700002101797700002101818700002101839773013401860856008501994852000902079655001202088IND60692749420221119033344.0200503e20160102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069274942DNAL7 a10.1080/09168451.2015.10627142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSugiyama, Akifumi10aDevelopmental and nutritional regulation of isoflavone secretion from soybean roots  ap. 89-94.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aIsoflavones play important roles in plant–microbe interactions in rhizospheres. Soybean roots secrete daidzein and genistein to attract rhizobia. Despite the importance of isoflavones in plant–microbe interactions, little is known about the developmental and nutritional regulation of isoflavone secretion from soybean roots. In this study, soybeans were grown in hydroponic culture, and isoflavone contents in tissues, isoflavone secretion from the roots, and the expression of isoflavone conjugates hydrolyzing beta-glucosidase (ICHG) were investigated. Isoflavone contents did not show strong growth-dependent changes, while secretion of daidzein from the roots dramatically changed, with higher secretion during vegetative stages. Coordinately, the expression of ICHG also peaked at vegetative stages. Nitrogen deficiency resulted in 8- and 15-fold increases in secretion of daidzein and genistein, respectively, with no induction of ICHG. Taken together, these results suggest that large amounts of isoflavones were secreted during vegetative stages via the hydrolysis of (malonyl)glucosides with ICHG.  aPublisher supplied data  aFC2001cMinistry of Agriculture, Forestry, and Fisheries of Japan  a26712013 and 26660279cJSPS KAKENHI 3abeta-glucosidase 3abiotechnology 3adaidzein 3agenistein 3aglucosides 3ahydrolysis 3ahydroponics 3anitrogen 3asecretion 3asoybeans 0aisoflavone secretion 0aroot exudates 0asoybean1 aYamazaki, Yumi1 aYamashita, Kazuaki1 aTakahashi, Seiji1 aNakayama, Tōru,1 aYazaki, Kazufumi0 tBioscience, biotechnology, and biochemistry.g2016 Jan. 2, v. 80, no. 1 p.89-94dTaylor & FranciswJournal:18959x1347-69477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09168451.2015.10627143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02240naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001600139245009700155300001800252500001500270520115700285592002801442650001901470650002401489650002101513650000901534650001701543650001701560650001901577650002401596650002001620653001101640700001401651700001801665773010101683856007301784852000901857655001201866IND60459364020221120221201.0151109e201512  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6045936402DNAL7 a10.1111/gcb.130712doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLin, Junjie10aDecadally cycling soil carbon is more sensitive to warming than faster‐cycling soil carbon  ap. 4602-4612.  a2019-12-06  aThe response of soil organic carbon (SOC) pools to globally rising surface temperature crucially determines the feedback between climate change and the global carbon cycle. However, there is a lack of studies investigating the temperature sensitivity of decomposition for decadally cycling SOC which is the main component of total soil carbon stock and the most relevant to global change. We tackled this issue using two decadally ¹³C‐labeled soils and a much improved measuring system in a long‐term incubation experiment. Results indicated that the temperature sensitivity of decomposition for decadally cycling SOC (>23 years in one soil and >55 years in the other soil) was significantly greater than that for faster‐cycling SOC (<23 or 55 years) or for the entire SOC stock. Moreover, decadally cycling SOC contributed substantially (35–59%) to the total CO₂ loss during the 360‐day incubation. Overall, these results indicate that the decomposition of decadally cycling SOC is highly sensitive to temperature change, which will likely make this large SOC stock vulnerable to loss by global warming in the 21st century and beyond.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon dioxide 3asoil organic carbon 3aisotope labeling 3asoil 3acarbon cycle 3acarbon sinks 3aglobal warming 3asurface temperature 3astable isotopes 0acarbon1 aZhu, Biao1 aCheng, Weixin0 tGlobal change biology.g2015 Dec., v. 21, no. 12 p.4602-4612dBlackwell Sciencex1354-10137nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/gcb.130713Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02871naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002300147245015100170300001600321520163800337592002801975650001702003650001202020650001602032650002102048650001502069650002602084650001202110650001802122650001902140651002102159651001402180651001902194651001102213651002102224700002402245773011402269856008102383852000902464655001202473IND60440597120221119170616.0151024e201507  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6044059712DNAL7 a10.1007/s12665-015-4052-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aUlibarrena, Javier10aMechanisms involved in the proliferation and distribution of phytoplankton in the Patagonian Sea, Argentina, as revealed by remote sensing studies  ap. 439-449.  aStudies about the mechanisms that control the dynamics of phytoplankton in terms of surface chlorophyll patches by means of remote sensing information were encouraged in the Patagonian Sea (South Atlantic Ocean). Over this sea, circulation of the Patagonian Current and Malvinas Current, originated in the Circumpolar Antarctic Current, has much to do in the distribution of algal biomass. The study confirms the existence of three ecosystems: Coastal system, Shelf waters system and Shelf break. In the former, algal blooms are detected mostly between March and August. Later, the patches move inside the shelf area, the second ecosystem, towards NNE direction from approximately August to December under the influence of the Patagonian Current to reach the Malvinas Current, which circulates along the shelf break. The third ecosystem, Malvinas system, may be divided into the Malvinas Islands, where an intense algal bloom from December to January could be verified, and the Malvinas Current that shows a high concentration of algal pigment in the same period, although evidences support the hypothesis that the latter has mainly an allochthonous character. At about 37°S–39°S and 53°W–56°W, variable position, the confluence between Malvinas Current and Brazil Current takes place. As a result, the chlorophyll that functions as a tracer indicates that the impact has the characteristics of being an elastic collision, since the Malvinas Current identity was preserved afterwards. Special events, such as the climatic conditions that prompt changes in the annual behavior of the phytoplankton distribution, are discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgal blooms 3abiomass 3achlorophyll 3aclimatic factors 3aecosystems 3aidentity preservation 3aislands 3aphytoplankton 3aremote sensing 3aAntarctic region 3aArgentina 3aAtlantic Ocean 3aBrazil 3aFalkland Islands1 aConzonno, Victor H.0 tEnvironmental earth sciences.g2015 July, v. 74, no. 1 p.439-449dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx1866-62807nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12665-015-4052-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02506naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001600139245008800155300001600243520156600259592002801825650001301853650002101866650001201887650001601899650001201915650002801927650000901955651001301964773013201977856007402109852000902183655001202192IND60792031620221118171335.0220904e20111119xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079203162DNAL7 a10.17221/3617-pse2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDoiová, R.10aMercury and methylmercury in plants from differently contaminated sites in Slovakia  ap. 456-463.  aConcentrations of methylmercury (MeHg) and total mercury (Hg<sub>total</sub>) were investigated in green leaves of herbs, deciduous and coniferous trees in 9 sites in Slovakia (the transect Žiar nad Hronom &ndash; Vt&aacute;čnik, Bansk&aacute; &Scaron;tiavnica, Rudňany). There was evaluated the relevance of plant uptake and the behaviour of transfer-factors. The MeHg and Hg<sub>total</sub> in leaves of plants from the contaminated sites in Rudňany (up to 3.21 and 802 ng Hg/g, respectively) were an order of magnitude larger than those from other sites, reflecting the strong Hg contamination in Rudňany&rsquo;s plants. The MeHg and Hg<sub>total</sub> concentrations in leaves (up to 0.285 and 55 ng Hg/g, respectively) from the transect Žiar nad Hronom &ndash; Vt&aacute;čnik and Bansk&aacute; &Scaron;tiavnica may be regarded as uncontaminated. The green leaves from Rudňany showed very low transfer-factors (up to 0.09) compared to the transfer-factors from the transect Žiar nad Hronom &ndash; Vt&aacute;čnik (up to 1.58), and thus indicated the relevance of Hg translocation from soils to leaves on contaminated sites. Generally, much higher MeHg concentrations in leaves of Corylus avellana L., Quercus polycarpa Schur. and Achillea millefolium&nbsp;L. as compared to the other plant species indicate species specific effects that is also confirmed by increased transfer coefficients for relevant leaves (up to 3.48, 2.51 and 0.35, respectively). The transfer-factors can bring up the species specific differences in the Hg uptake by plants.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAchillea 3aCorylus avellana 3aQuercus 3aenvironment 3amercury 3amethylmercury compounds 3asoil 3aSlovakia0 tPlant, Soil and Environment.g, v. 51, no. 10 p.456-463dCzech Academy of Agricultural ScienceswJournal:17122x1214-11787nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.17221/3617-pse3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02339naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002100151245008200172300001400254500001900268520104000287592002801327650001701355650001801372650002001390650001101410650001401421650002001435650002101455650001301476650000901489650002901498653003501527653001901562653001801581653001701599653002001616700002101636700002001657773013401677856008501811852000901896655001201905IND60692749520221119033206.0200503e20160102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069274952DNAL7 a10.1080/09168451.2015.10627152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAkagawa, Mitsugu10aRecent progress in studies on the health benefits of pyrroloquinoline quinone  ap. 13-22.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aPyrroloquinoline quinone (PQQ), an aromatic tricyclic o-quinone, was identified initially as a redox cofactor for bacterial dehydrogenases. Although PQQ is not biosynthesized in mammals, trace amounts of PQQ have been found in human and rat tissues because of its wide distribution in dietary sources. Importantly, nutritional studies in rodents have revealed that PQQ deficiency exhibits diverse systemic responses, including growth impairment, immune dysfunction, and abnormal reproductive performance. Although PQQ is not currently classified as a vitamin, PQQ has been implicated as an important nutrient in mammals. In recent years, PQQ has been receiving much attention owing to its physiological importance and pharmacological effects. In this article, we review the potential health benefits of PQQ with a focus on its growth-promoting activity, anti-diabetic effect, anti-oxidative action, and neuroprotective function. Additionally, we provide an update of its basic pharmacokinetics and safety information in oral ingestion.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiosynthesis 3abiotechnology 3aglycemic effect 3ahumans 3aingestion 3aoxidoreductases 3apharmacokinetics 3aquinones 3arats 3areproductive performance 0apyrroloquinoline quinone (PQQ) 0aredox cofactor 0aanti-diabetes 0aanti-oxidant 0aneuroprotection1 aNakano, Masahiko1 aIkemoto, Kazuto0 tBioscience, biotechnology, and biochemistry.g2016 Jan. 2, v. 80, no. 1 p.13-22dTaylor & FranciswJournal:18959x1347-69477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09168451.2015.10627153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02568naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002100148245015400169300001800323500001900341520128200360592002801642650002101670650002001691650002401711650001001735650001301745650001101758650001601769650001701785650001401802650001301816650001301829651002201842700001701864700006601881773013101947856008302078852000902161655001202170IND60711335120221118021556.0210309e202010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071133512DNAL7 a10.1007/s00436-020-06848-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKhammassi, Manel10aMorphological and molecular identification of Hysterothylacium larvae (Nematoda: Raphidascarididae) in marine fish from Tunisian Mediterranean coasts  ap. 3285-3296.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe taxonomy of Hysterothylacium genus in Mediterranean waters remains incomplete and unresolved. The aim of the current study was to investigate the morphological and molecular identification of selected species of Hysterothylacium larvae in marine fish from the Tunisian Mediterranean coasts. A total of 192 marine fish samples were examined. In total, thirty-seven third-stage larvae of Hysterothylacium were morphologically identified as Hysterothylacium type V. In the present study, representatives of this type from the Mediterranean Sea were genetically characterized for the first time by sequencing the rDNA ITS (ITS1-5.8S-ITS2) regions and mtDNA cox2 gene. This study represents the first report of Hysterothylacium type V from the Mediterranean Sea. We also report Mullus barbatus, M. surmuletus, and Pagellus erythrinus as new hosts for this larval type. Based upon molecular and phylogenetic analyses considering the rDNA ITS regions, the Hysterothylacium type V described here was classified as a new genotype, named Genotype B. The valid genetic data of the described Hysterothylacium type V in the present study can be used to establish the phylogenetic relationships among Hysterothylacium species from the Mediterranean Sea and worldwide for future research.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHysterothylacium 3aMullus barbatus 3aPagellus erythrinus 3agenes 3agenotype 3alarvae 3amarine fish 3aparasitology 3aphylogeny 3aresearch 3ataxonomy 3aMediterranean Sea1 aBahri, Sihem1 aPekmezci, Gokmen Zafer1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7791-19590 tParasitology research.g2020 Oct., v. 119, no. 10 p.3285-3296dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl3870072x0932-01137nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00436-020-06848-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02206naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001500147245002700162300001600189520118100205592002801386650001301414650001001427650001201437650002501449650001601474650001101490650001401501650001401515650001101529650001401540650001201554651002101566700001501587700001401602773011401616856008101730852000901811655001201820IND60440597220221119170732.0151024e201507  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6044059722DNAL7 a10.1007/s12665-015-4298-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGünay, G.10aTurkish karst aquifers  ap. 217-226.  aOne third of Turkey’s surface is underlain by carbonate rocks that have been subdivided into four karst regions. The carbonate rock units are about 200 km wide along the Taurus Mountains that attain elevations of 2500 m. Karst features of western Turkey bordering the Aegean and Mediterranean seas demonstrate the tectonic, lithological and climatic controls on the occurrence, movement, and chemical characteristics of groundwater. In Turkey all karstic feature, such as lapies, caves, sinkholes, uvalas, poljes, ground river valleys developed in all karstic areas. Karstification is related not only to the thickness and to purity of limestone, climate and height but also to tectonic movements. Water resources of karst terrains of Turkey are relatively rich and as such are very important for the economic development of the country. High mountain chains, very often associated with the karst terrains, are responsible for some important and beneficial characteristics of these water resources.

The producing pseudomonads use multiple modes of self-protection, two of which are characterized in this study. The first is the dipeptide ligase TblF which converts tabtoxinine-β-lactam to the TβL-Thr dipeptide known as tabtoxin. The dipeptide is not recognized by glutamine synthetase. This represents a Trojan Horse strategy: the dipeptide is secreted, taken up by dipeptide permeases in neighboring cells, and TβL is released by peptidase action. The second self-protection mode is elaboration by the acetyltransferase Ttr, which acetylates the α-amino group of the proximal inactivator TβL, but not the tabtoxin dipeptide.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPseudomonas syringae 3aglutamate-ammonia ligase 3aglutamine1 aWalsh, Christopher,0 tBiochemistry.g2012 Oct. 02, v. 51, no. 39 p.7712-7725dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-49957nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fbi30113843Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02361naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100001500154245016000169300001600329520100900345592002801354650001401382650001301396650001701409650001701426650001101443650001301454650001301467650001901480650000701499650002501506650001801531650002801549650001701577700001401594700002101608700001301629700001901642700001701661700001601678773012301694856008901817852000901906655001201915IND60543399620221120080759.0190410e201501  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054339962DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jphotobiol.2014.10.0202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Huajie10aPhotosensitizer-encapsulated amphiphilic chitosan derivative micelles: Photoactivity and enhancement of phototoxicity against human pancreatic cancer cells  ap. 212-219.  aPhotosensitizer-encapsulated amphiphilic chitosan derivative (Photosan-DA-Chit) micelles with controlled photoactivity have been prepared using a simple self-assembly method in phosphate-buffered saline (pH 6.2). The fluorescence quantum yield and fluorescence lifetime of the Photosan-DA-Chit micelles were lower than those of free Photosan, which indicated that the micelles were suppressing the photoactivity of Photosan. However, upon incubation with human pancreatic cancer cells (i.e., Panc-1 cells), the Photosan-DA-Chit micelles showed higher fluorescence activity than free Photosan and generated higher levels of reactive oxygen species under laser illumination. The Photosan-DA-Chit micelles therefore exhibited strong phototoxicity, which led to significant levels of apoptosis in the Panc-1 cells. In the absence of light, however, the Photosan-DA-Chit micelles showed no cytotoxicity. These results indicated that they could be used as a potential photodynamic therapy in pancreatic cancer.  aPublisher supplied data 3aapoptosis 3achitosan 3acytotoxicity 3afluorescence 3ahumans 3alighting 3amicelles 3aneoplasm cells 3apH 3apancreatic neoplasms 3aphototoxicity 3areactive oxygen species 3atherapeutics1 aYu, Zhong1 aWang, Shuangping1 aLong, Xi1 aZhang, Li-Ming1 aZhu, Zhaohua1 aYang, Liqun0 tJournal of photochemistry and photobiology.g2015 Jan., v. 142 p.212-219dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6193x1011-13447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jphotobiol.2014.10.0203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02204naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245012800166300001400294520098500308592002801293650001601321650002401337650001001361650002101371650001301392650002901405650001501434650001101449653000901460653000901469653003201478653002701510653001001537653001201547653000801559700001701567773011901584856008201703852000901785655001201794IND60533280820221117173731.0160728e20151204xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053328082DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbrc.2015.11.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTanaka, Naoko10aYeast Cyc8p and Tup1p proteins function as coactivators for transcription of Stp1/2p-dependent amino acid transporter genes  ap. 32-38.  aThe yeast Cyc8p-Tup1p complex is known to serve primarily as a transcriptional corepressor in a variety of biological processes. However, less is known about its function as a coactivator. Herein, we found tryptophan transporter genes, TAT1 and TAT2, that, when overexpressed, suppressed the slow growth of Δcyc8. We observed that the addition of tryptophan to Δcyc8 cultures partially restored cell growth, and the deletion of CYC8 and TUP1 reduced transcriptional levels of TAT1 and TAT2. Tup1p bound to the promoter region of TAT1 and TAT2 genes that were dependent on STP1 and STP2 (encoding DNA-binding activator proteins) for expression. Similarly, transcription of the other Stp1/2p-dependent amino acid transporter (AAT) genes also required CYC8 and TUP1 gene functions. These data indicate that Cyc8p-Tup1p plays a role as a transcriptional coactivator for AAT genes via Stp1/2p activators and that lowering intracellular tryptophan by CYC8 deletion causes slow growth.  aPublisher supplied data 3acell growth 3agene overexpression 3agenes 3apromoter regions 3aproteins 3atranscription (genetics) 3atryptophan 3ayeasts 0aCYC8 0aTUP1 0aTranscriptional coactivator 0aAmino acid transporter 0aYeast 0aRT-qPCR 0aAAT1 aMukai, Yukio0 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2015 Dec. 04, v. 468 p.32-38dElsevier Inc.x0006-291X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2015.11.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02692naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245015500169500001900324520120800343592002801551650004301579650002201622650002601644650002501670650002901695650001501724650003701739650001801776650001701794650002101811653002801832653002501860653002701885653003301912700001901945700001201964700001601976700005401992773011702046856008602163852000902249655001202258IND60713975220221122194052.0210114e20201215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071397522DNAL7 a10.1016/j.indcrop.2020.1129612doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Ke-Xin10aExtract from Oenothera biennis L. stalks efficiently inhibits Staphylococcus aureus activity by affecting cell permeability and respiratory metabolism  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aCurrent studies on Oenothera biennis L. have focused on seeds rather than on stalks. Thus, information on the bioactive effects of O. biennis stalks is lacking. Therefore, this study investigated the antibacterial effect of O. biennis stalk extract (OBSE) and its underlying mechanisms against Staphylococcus aureus in terms of cell permeability and respiration metabolism to effectively utilize O. biennis stalks. Results showed that OBSE inhibited S. aureus growth. The diameter of the inhibitory zone reached 13.57 mm, and the minimum inhibitory concentration was 1 mg/mL. The activity of alkaline phosphatase and the levels of electronic conductivity, nucleic acid, and protein in S. aureus suspension were remarkably decreased (p < 0.01) by OBSE treatment because of the leakage of cell contents. Furthermore, OBSE inhibited S. aureus respiration. The superposition rate of OBSE and trisodium phosphate was the lowest, and the activity of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase was obviously decreased (p < 0.01) by OBSE treatment. Thus, OBSE was involved in regulating the hexose monophosphate pathway. Consequently, O. biennis stalks have a potential application in antibacterial products.  aPublisher supplied data 3aNADP-glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase 3aOenothera biennis 3aStaphylococcus aureus 3aalkaline phosphatase 3aantibacterial properties 3ametabolism 3aminimum inhibitory concentration 3anucleic acids 3apermeability 3asodium phosphate 0aOenothera biennis stalk 0aCell content leakage 0aRespiratory inhibition 0aHexose monophosphate pathway1 aPiao, Xuan-Mei1 aLi, Jia1 aJin, Mei-Yu1 aJiang, Jun1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5345-90160 tIndustrial crops and products.g2020 Dec. 15, v. 158 p.112961-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl49222x0926-66907nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.indcrop.2020.1129613Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03904naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245014600165300001600311520205400327592002802381650001102409650001802420650002202438650002202460650002102482650002502503650002602528650001202554650001902566650001602585650002602601650002202627650001402649650001702663650001602680650001002696650001902706650000902725650002202734650001102756650003702767650002502804650001702829651001002846653003802856653002002894653001602914653002402930653002302954653003702977700002103014700001703035700001203052700002003064773010303084856008203187852000903269655001203278IND60542190120221118012407.0190402e201501  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054219012DNAL7 a10.1016/j.agsy.2014.10.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Run Jin10aIntegrating irrigation management for improved grain yield of winter wheat and rhizosphere AM fungal diversity in a semi-arid cropping system  ap. 167-173.  aIrrigation of farmland is a popular agricultural practice in semi-arid areas in China. However, little is known about the impacts of different irrigation strategies on grain yield and soil microbial communities, particularly economically-important arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi. The aim of this study was to optimize irrigation strategies to integrate maximized grain yield, AM fungal diversity and water productivity (defined here as grain yield per unit water supplied). Six irrigation strategies consisting of different amounts of water supplied and time of supply were imposed for field-grown winter wheat (Triticum aestivum) in a typical cropping system in northern China. Results showed that all irrigation strategies significantly increased grain yield compared with the non-irrigation practice (P < 0.01). Irrigation strategy (treatment WJF180) with a total of 180-mm water supplied at Wintering, Jointing, and Grain filling stages (60 mm each) achieved maximal grain yield and water productivity than other treatments. Irrigation strategies also significantly influenced mycorrhizal colonization on roots, fungal species and spore abundance in rhizosphere soil. A total of 17 AM fungal species belonging to Glomus, Acaulopora, Scutellospora and Entrophospora were detected in the soil. The relative abundance of Glomus was the highest and Entrophospora the lowest among the four fungal genera. WJF180-treated plots had the largest species richness and spore abundance in various sampling times with plant growth. Fungal diversity differed greatly among different plant phenological stages. There were significant interactions between irrigation treatments and plant growth stages on both grain yield and AM fungi (species diversity and spore abundance). Irrigation strategies in terms of water amount and watering time integrated with biological, environmental and crop management could have potential for improved grain yield and mycorrhizal diversity leading to maximized farmers' economic productivity and water-use efficiency.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGlomus 3aScutellospora 3aTriticum aestivum 3aagricultural land 3acropping systems 3adevelopmental stages 3aeconomic productivity 3afarmers 3afilling period 3agrain yield 3airrigation management 3amycorrhizal fungi 3aphenology 3aplant growth 3arhizosphere 3aroots 3asemiarid zones 3asoil 3aspecies diversity 3aspores 3avesicular arbuscular mycorrhizae 3awater use efficiency 3awinter wheat 3aChina 0aArbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi 0aCropping system 0aGrain yield 0aIrrigation strategy 0aWater productivity 0aWinter wheat (Triticum aestivum)1 aSheng, Ping Ping1 aHui, Hai Bin1 aLin, Qi1 aChen, Ying Long0 tAgricultural systems.g2015 Jan., v. 132 p.167-173dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl7186x0308-521X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agsy.2014.10.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04284naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002500140245017200165300002000337500001900357520266200376592002803038650001003066650002203076650002503098650001703123650001703140650001703157650001503174650001103189650001203200650001603212650001103228650002103239650001203260650001503272650003703287650003703324650001903361650001503380651001003395700002803405700002103433700001803454700002003472700002403492700003103516773012403547856007403671852000903745655001203754IND60738200020221116195801.0210521e20210518xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073820002DNAL7 a10.1039/d1ra01725j2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEl-Hawwary, Seham S.10aGreen-synthesized zinc oxide nanoparticles, anti-Alzheimer potential and the metabolic profiling of Sabal blackburniana grown in Egypt supported by molecular modelling  ap. 18009-18025.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aNowadays, the biosynthesis of metal nanoparticles, particularly from plants, has been gaining interest. In the present work, the methanolic extracts of leaves, fruits, and the pollen grains of Sabal blackburniana were used for the green synthesis of ZnO nanoparticles, which were early detected by the formation of precipitate and further confirmed by UV-vis spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infra-red (FT-IR) spectroscopy and zeta potential (ZP) studies. TEM analysis has shown different shapes, predominantly irregular small spherical narrow particles included in hexagonal structures with size ranging from 2.23 to 49.56 nm. The XRD pattern confirmed that all synthesized ZnO nanoparticles have wurtzite hexagonal structure with crystalline nature. The average particle crystallite sizes were 47.21, 47.67 and 47.8 nm. The UV-visible spectra showed λₘₐₓ in the range of 354–368 nm, which indicated the presence of ZnO nanoparticles. The FT-IR analysis identifies the characteristic functional groups present on the surface of ZnO nanoparticles. The ZP determination demonstrated that all representative selected synthesized ZnONPs exhibited acceptable ZP values of −30.8 to −45.9 mV, which indicated their good stability. In addition, the anti-Alzheimer potential of the selected extracts and ZnONPs was evaluated by assessing acetylcholinesterase inhibitory activity in vitro according to the improved Ellman method. The results indicated that the selected extracts have acetylcholinesterase inhibitory activity, and highlighted the promising inhibitory potential of green-synthesized ZnONPs using pollen grains, fruits and leaves extracts; they exhibited a potent inhibitory effect with IC₅₀ values 63.78 ± 1.04651, 81.985 ± 3.075 and 117.95 ± 6.858 ng ml⁻¹ respectively in comparison to donepezil as standard (IC₅₀ = 50.7 ± 5.769 ng ml⁻¹). Dereplication analysis of the selected extracts was performed using LC-MS; metabolic profiling revealed the presence of 41 compounds belonging to various chemical classes: flavonoids, steroidal saponins, terpenoids, alkaloids, lignans, sterols and fatty acids. Docking these dereplicated metabolites against the human AChE showed that the non-glycosylated flavonoid class of compounds was able to achieve interesting binding modes inside the AChE active site; they are suggested to be associated with the observed anti-AChE activity of Sabal extracts. This study is the first report to shed light on the acetylcholinesterase inhibitory activity of green-synthesized ZnO nanoparticles of S. blackburniana metabolites.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSabal 3aX-ray diffraction 3aacetylcholinesterase 3aactive sites 3abiosynthesis 3acrystallites 3aflavonoids 3ahumans 3alignans 3ametabolites 3apollen 3asteroid saponins 3asterols 3aterpenoids 3atransmission electron microscopy 3aultraviolet-visible spectroscopy 3azeta potential 3azinc oxide 3aEgypt1 aAbd Almaksoud, Hanan M.1 aSaber, Fatema R.1 aElimam, Hanan1 aSayed, Ahmed M.1 aEl Raey, Mohamed A.1 aAbdelmohsen, Usama Ramadan0 tRSC advances.g2021 May 18, v. 11, no. 29 p.18009-18025dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d1ra01725j3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03129naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001700139245009200156300001800248520196700266592002802233650001302261650001402274650001902288650002402307650002002331650001102351650001502362650002202377650001302399650002202412650001502434650001102449650001402460651001102474700002102485700003002506773010102536856007302637852000902710655001202719IND60459364320221120164922.0151109e201512  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6045936432DNAL7 a10.1111/gcb.130062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRoff, George10aDecadal‐scale rates of reef erosion following El Niño‐related mass coral mortality  ap. 4415-4424.  aAs the frequency and intensity of coral mortality events increase under climate change, understanding how declines in coral cover may affect the bioerosion of reef frameworks is of increasing importance. Here, we explore decadal‐scale rates of bioerosion of the framework building coral Orbicella annularis by grazing parrotfish following the 1997/1998 El Niño‐related mass mortality event at Long Cay, Belize. Using high‐precision U‐Th dating and CT scan analysis, we quantified in situ rates of external bioerosion over a 13‐year period (1998–2011). Based upon the error‐weighted average U‐Th age of dead O. annularis skeletons, we estimate the average external bioerosion between 1998 and 2011 as 0.92 ± 0.55 cm depth. Empirical observations of herbivore foraging, and a nonlinear numerical response of parrotfish to an increase in food availability, were used to create a model of external bioerosion at Long Cay. Model estimates of external bioerosion were in close agreement with U‐Th estimates (0.85 ± 0.09 cm). The model was then used to quantify how rates of external bioerosion changed across a gradient of coral mortality (i.e., from few corals experiencing mortality following coral bleaching to complete mortality). Our results indicate that external bioerosion is remarkably robust to declines in coral cover, with no significant relationship predicted between the rate of external bioerosion and the proportion of O. annularis that died in the 1998 bleaching event. The outcome was robust because the reduction in grazing intensity that follows coral mortality was compensated for by a positive numerical response of parrotfish to an increase in food availability. Our model estimates further indicate that for an O. annularis‐dominated reef to maintain a positive state of reef accretion, a necessity for sustained ecosystem function, live cover of O. annularis must not drop below a ~5–10% threshold of cover.  aPublisher supplied data 3aScaridae 3ableaching 3aclimate change 3acomputed tomography 3acoral bleaching 3acorals 3aecosystems 3afood availability 3aforaging 3agrazing intensity 3aherbivores 3amodels 3amortality 3aBelize1 aZhao, Jian‐xin1 aMumby, P.

Recent studies have discovered 4-octyl itaconate (OI) as a novel and cell permeable Nrf2 (nuclear-factor-E2-related factor 2) activator. Its potential activity in HG-treated HUVECs was tested here. In HUVECs OI disrupted Keap1-Nrf2 association, causing Nrf2 protein accumulation and nuclear translocation, as well as transcription and expression of Nrf2-ARE-dependent genes, including HO1, NQO1 and GCLM. Significantly, pretreatment with OI potently inhibited HG (40 mM glucose)-induced death and apoptosis of HUVECs. Moreover, OI potently inhibited HG-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, lipid peroxidation, superoxide accumulation and mitochondrial depolarization in HUVECs. Activation of Nrf2 is required for OI-induced cytoprotection in HUVECs. Nrf2 shRNA or knockout (by CRISPR/Cas9 method) reversed OI-mediated HUVEC protection against HG. Further studies showed that Keap1 silencing or Cys151S mutation mimicked and nullified OI-induced activity in HUVECs. Taken together, we conclude that OI activates Keap1-Nrf2 signaling to protect HUVECs from HG.  aPublisher supplied data 3aapoptosis 3adeath 3agenes 3aglucose 3ahuman umbilical vein endothelial cells 3alipid peroxidation 3amitochondria 3amutation 3areactive oxygen species 3atranscription (genetics) 0aHigh glucose 0aHUVECs 0aOxidative injury 0a4-octyl itaconate 0aNrf2 signaling1 aTan, Shengyu1 aZhang, Yiqing1 aDong, Lini1 aXu, Yan0 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2019 Jan. 15, v. 508, no. 3 p.921-927dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl46848x0006-291X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2018.12.0323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03061naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100002300154245013100177300001500308520140300323592002801726650000801754650001501762650001601777650001401793650001301807650002701820650001701847650001801864650002301882650001701905650002701922650001301949650001101962650001801973650001501991650001902006650002002025650001302045650002102058650002502079650003702104700002002141700001702161700002002178700002702198700002402225700002002249700001802269773012202287856008902409852000902498655001202507IND60543399820221120080839.0190410e201501  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054339982DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jphotobiol.2014.11.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMujtaba, Syed Faiz10aSuperoxide mediated photomodification and DNA damage induced apoptosis by Benz(a)anthracene via mitochondrial mediated pathway  ap. 92-102.  aBenz(a)anthracene (BA) is an ubiquitous environmental pollutant of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon’s (PAHs) family. We showed superoxide (O2−) catalyzed BA photo modification and apoptosis in HaCaT keratinocytes under sunlight exposure. O2− generation was confirmed by quenching through superoxide dismutase (SOD). BA induced photocytotoxicity were investigated through MTT and NRU assay. We proposed DNA insults such as single and double strand breakage and CPDs formation which results in cell cycle arrest and apoptosis by photosensitized BA. BA induced apoptosis was caspase dependent and occurred through a mitochondrial pathway. Reduction of mitochondrial membrane potential, translocation of Bax to mitochondria and cytochrome c release favors involvement of mitochondria in BA phototoxicity. AO/EB double staining and TEM analysis also support apoptotic cell death. We propose a p21 regulated apoptosis via expression of Bax, and cleaved PARP under sunlight exposure. Thus, we conclude that it is imperative to avoid solar radiation during peak hr (between 11A.M. and 3P.M.) when the amount of solar radiation is high, in the light of DNA damage which may lead to mutation or skin cancer through photosensitized BA under sunlight exposure. Concomitantly, investigation is urgently required for the photosafety of BA photoproducts reaching in the environment through photomodification.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aDNA damage 3aanthracenes 3aapoptosis 3acaspases 3acell cycle checkpoints 3acytochrome c 3akeratinocytes 3amembrane potential 3amitochondria 3amitochondrial membrane 3amutation 3aoxygen 3aphototoxicity 3apollutants 3askin neoplasms 3asolar radiation 3astaining 3asuperoxide anion 3asuperoxide dismutase 3atransmission electron microscopy1 aDwivedi, Ashish1 aYadav, Neera1 aCh, Ratnasekhar1 aKushwaha, Hari Narayan1 aMudiam, Mohana K.R.1 aSingh, Gajendra1 aRay, Ratan S.0 tJournal of photochemistry and photobiology.g2015 Jan., v. 142 p.92-102dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6193x1011-13447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jphotobiol.2014.11.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02654naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100003000140245011900170520143100289592002801720650001901748650001401767650001501781650001401796650002601810650001501836650001901851650000901870650001501879700004101894700003901935700002801974700004302002700002802045773012302073856007502196852000902271655001202280IND60787830820221119235628.0220811e20220730xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078783082DNAL7 a10.3390/nu141531542doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFayh, Ana Paula Trussardi10aSARC-F Is a Predictor of Longer LOS and Hospital Readmission in Hospitalized Patients after a Cardiovascular Event  aIt is already established that sarcopenia is associated with adverse outcomes; however, few studies have focused on patients who have suffered an acute cardiovascular event. The use of SARC-F, a 5-item sarcopenia screening questionnaire, in these patients remains to be investigated. We aimed to investigate whether SARC-F can predict adverse outcomes in patients admitted to a hospital with a suspected infarction. This is a 1-year prospective cohort study. During hospitalization, patients completed the SARC-F questionnaire (scores ≥ 4 considered positive for the risk of sarcopenia). Length of hospital stay (LOS), new hospital admission, myocardial infarction, and cardiovascular mortality were collected via medical records and phone interviews. In total, 180 patients were evaluated. The median age was 60.6 years; 72.3% of the participants were men, and half of the sample had comorbidities. The median SARC-F score was 1.0 (interquartile range, 0–3.0), and 21.1% of the participants screened positive. Risk of sarcopenia was independently associated with longer LOS (odds ratio, 2.34; 95% CI, 1.09–5.04; p = 0.030) and hospital readmission (odds ratio, 3.73; 95% CI, 1.60–8.69; p = 0.002). One-fifth of post-acute cardiovascular event patients in this cohort screened positive for sarcopenia using the SARC-F screening questionnaire. Positive scores were associated with a longer LOS and hospital readmission.  aPublisher supplied data 3acohort studies 3ahospitals 3ainfarction 3amortality 3amyocardial infarction 3aodds ratio 3aquestionnaires 3arisk 3asarcopenia1 aGuedes, Francisco Felipe de Oliveira1 aCalado, Guilherme Carlos Filgueira1 aQueiroz, Sandra Azevedo1 aAnselmo, Marina Gabriely Gomes Barbosa1 aSousa, Iasmin Matias de0 tNutrients.g2022 July 30, v. 14, no. 15dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2271x2072-66437nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/nu141531543Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02828naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245012700164300001600291520150000307592002801807650001601835650002301851650001601874650001101890650002101901650002101922650002601943650002101969650001601990650001602006650000902022650000902031650001502040650002102055650001602076650001502092651001702107700001302124700001202137700001702149773011402166856008102280852000902361655001202370IND60440597720221119170607.0151024e201507  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6044059772DNAL7 a10.1007/s12665-015-4034-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Tiegang10aSimulation of groundwater evaporation and groundwater depth using SWAT in the irrigation district with shallow water table  ap. 315-324.  aIn irrigation districts with shallow water table, groundwater evaporation (ETgw) and groundwater depth are important variables for the study of water balance. These variables are influenced by natural factors and human activity. In this study, a new method of simulating ETgw was used for SWAT, and the computing and output modules of groundwater depth were established. In addition, based on simulations, we analyzed the influences of irrigation schedules and soil types on ETgw and groundwater depth in the Irrigation Districts along the Lower Reach of Yellow River Basin. The applicabilities of the three methods (Hargreaves, Priestley–Taylor and Penman–Monteith) simulating potential evapotranspiration in SWAT 2000 were evaluated by the measured groundwater evaporation, and Hargreaves was applied in the simulation for irrigation district due to its smallest simulation error. The results presented that the mean groundwater depth decreased with the increase of irrigation amount. However, the changes of soil water storage in root zone and groundwater depth might have more complex effects on the variation of the mean groundwater evaporation. Loamy sand had the smallest annual mean groundwater depth and mean annual ETgw in the study area, while silt loam corresponded to the largest groundwater depth and groundwater evaporation. This study provides a new method for making simulations and analyses of the hydrological cycle in irrigation districts which has a shallow water table.  aPublisher supplied data 3aevaporation 3aevapotranspiration 3agroundwater 3ahumans 3ahydrologic cycle 3airrigation rates 3airrigation scheduling 3aloamy sand soils 3amethodology 3arhizosphere 3asand 3asilt 3asoil water 3asurge irrigation 3awater table 3awatersheds 3aYellow River1 aLiu, Lei1 aLuo, Yi1 aLai, Jianbin0 tEnvironmental earth sciences.g2015 July, v. 74, no. 1 p.315-324dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx1866-62807nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12665-015-4034-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02308naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245008800166300001800254500001900272520066100291592002800952596005900980596005901039596006701098596010101165650002401266650001701290650001601307650001901323650001101342650001001353650001101363650001001374650001701384650001701401650001301418650001301431650001601444651001001460700001201470700001501482700001301497700001501510700005401525773013101579856008301710852000901793655001201802IND60711335520221118021635.0210309e202010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071133552DNAL7 a10.1007/s00436-020-06850-w2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWei, Xiaoxing12aA human corneal ulcer caused by Thelazia callipaeda in Southwest China: case report  ap. 3531-3534.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aIn this study, we describe a rare human case with corneal ulcer caused by thelaziosis in a 69-year-old man in Southwest China.

A new method for ecosystem assessment was proposed based on the combination of rain-use efficiency (RUE) and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). This study aimed to alleviate the effect of precipitation fluctuation on ecosystem productivity. The trend of annual precipitation, annual maximum NDVI, and annual RUE of the study area was first analyzed. The relationship between RUE and precipitation at both temporal and spatial scales was then clarified. Finally, the relationship between the trends of RUE and NDVI was recognized. According to this trend, ecosystem degradation or recovery determined, and the mask of precipitation fluctuation were removed. Results showed that annual RUE varied significantly in space from 1999 to 2008. Annual precipitation displayed a decreasing trend, whereas the annual maximum NDVI presented an increasing trend in most karst ecosystems. RUE presented a remarkable declining trend with annual precipitation at both the temporal and spatial scales (P < 0.001). At a significant level of 0.2, most karst ecosystems at 16 weather stations were recovering from 1999 to 2008. Ecosystems of Baise, Hechi, and Mengshan stations were in pseudo recovery, whereas those of Laibin and Duan stations were in pseudo degradation because of precipitation fluctuation. At a significant level of 0.05, most karst ecosystems showed non-significant change except four stations were in pseudo recovery. The method of combining RUE and NDVI for ecosystem assessment may remove the mask of precipitation fluctuations and thus improve single NDVI-based method for vegetation analysis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aatmospheric precipitation 3acase studies 3aecosystems 3akarsts 3anormalized difference vegetation index 3avegetation 3aweather stations 3aChina1 aWei, Xinghu1 aZhou, Hongyi0 tEnvironmental earth sciences.g2015 July, v. 74, no. 2 p.977-984dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx1866-62807nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12665-014-3679-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02782naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100003500148245007700183300001800260500001900278520115700297592002801454596007501482596007501557596008501632650001501717650001801732650001801750650001301768650001901781650002401800650001501824650001801839650002001857650001701877650001401894650001301908651001101921651001101932651001801943700001901961700003201980700002502012700002802037773013102065856008302196852000902279655001202288IND60711335620221118021444.0210309e202010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071133562DNAL7 a10.1007/s00436-020-06835-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 ade Abreu Reis Ferreira, Daniel10aMolecular detection of Apicomplexan hemoparasites in anurans from Brazil  ap. 3469-3479.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aAmphibians are among the most threatened vertebrate groups in the world, and the main causes include climate change, habitat destruction, and emerging diseases. Herein, we investigated the occurrence and characterized molecularly Apicomplexa in anurans from southeastern Brazil. Forty individuals from seven anuran species were sampled in São Paulo state. In the molecular analyses, one Leptodactylus latrans and one Rhinella diptycha were positive in PCR assays for species of Hepatozoon. Two L. latrans were also positive for coccidian infections (Lankesterella sp. and an unidentified coccidian species). Phylogenetic analysis based on 18S rDNA clustered the sequences detected in anurans from the present study with Hepatozoon spp. detected in reptiles and other anurans from Brazil, albeit they were separate from Hepatozoon haplotypes detected in frogs from Africa and North America. Our study showed, for the first time, the molecular detection of Lankesterella sp. and another coccidian in L. latrans. Additionally, co-infection by different species of Hepatozoon haplotypes and an unidentified coccidian in anurans from Brazil was documented.  aPublisher supplied data  a2018/02753-0cFundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado de São Paulo  a2019/15150-4cFundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado de São Paulo  a302420 / 2017-7cConselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico 3aHepatozoon 3aLankesterella 3aLeptodactylus 3aRhinella 3aclimate change 3ahabitat destruction 3ahaplotypes 3ahemoparasites 3amixed infection 3aparasitology 3aphylogeny 3aresearch 3aAfrica 3aBrazil 3aNorth America1 aPerles, Lívia1 aMachado, Rosangela Zacarias1 aPrado, Cynthia P.

An inventory and meta-analysis  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aA study of the literature dealing with micromorphology of Belgian soils and palaeosoils is presented. Most soils in Belgium developed in Quaternary covers, sandy in the north, becoming more silty towards the south, and mixed with more or less important amounts of substrate material. In addition, azonal soils occur in the recent dunes, the marine Polders and the alluvial areas. The main pedogenic micromorphological characteristics are bioturbation, clay illuviation features in the more silty materials, and spodic features in the more sandy materials. Glauconite plays an important role in pedogenesis. Throughout most profiles, features related to a sub-recent pedogenic environment are recognised, pointing to polygenetic soil formation. Impact of periglacial conditions is often visible. Bog ores in alluvial plains have a complex mineralogical composition and microfabric. Buried palaeosoils and soil sediments are discussed separately according to their age whereas polygenetic soils are treated together with the recent soils according to their geographic position. For some areas, e.g., the Polders, the sandy area of Flanders and the Pays de Gaume in the southernmost part of Belgium, only little micromorphological information is available. Most soils studied were situated under natural vegetation; studies of cultivated soils are rather rare.  aPublisher supplied data 3abioturbation 3acatenas 3aclay 3ailluviation 3ainventories 3ameta-analysis 3amicrostructure 3apolders 3asoil 3asoil formation 3avegetation 3aBelgium 0aLoess 0aPolygenetic soils 0aGlauconite 0aBog ore 0aLuvisols 0aPodzols 0aCambisols 0aRetisols 0aPeriglacial1 aLangohr, Roger1 aVan Ranst, Eric1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1698-36840 tCatena.g2020 Nov., v. 194 p.104718-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6271x0341-81627nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.catena.2020.1047183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02651naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002200140245006000162520155800222592002801780650001301808650001301821650001601834650002701850650001101877650001901888650002401907651001501931700002101946700002001967700001901987700002202006700002002028700002202048773012302070856007502193852000902268655001202277IND60787831020221119235530.0220811e20220730xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078783102DNAL7 a10.3390/nu141531562doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBlack, Maureen M.10aRethinking Responsive Feeding: Insights from Bangladesh  aYoung children’s growth is influenced by food and feeding behavior. Responsive feeding has been shown to promote healthy growth and development, to prevent under- and overfeeding, and to encourage children’s self-regulation. However, most measures of responsive feeding do not incorporate bidirectional mother-infant responsivity or early learning principles and have not been validated against observations. To overcome these gaps, we laid the groundwork for a responsive feeding measure based on a community sample of 67 mothers and their 6–18-month-old children in Bangladesh. Children were weighed and measured. Mothers reported on their child’s dietary intake and responded to a 38-item responsive feeding questionnaire developed through a 2-phase Delphi procedure. Based on a video-recorded feeding observation, mother-child dyads were categorized into proximal (43%) and distal (57%) responsivity groups. Using stepwise logistic regression, a 9-item model from the responsive feeding questionnaire had excellent fit (AUC = 0.93), sensitivity (90%), specificity (89%), positive predictive value (87%), and negative predictive value (93%). Proximal responsivity was characterized by maternal concerns about children’s dietary intake. Distal responsivity was characterized by maternal perception of children’s happy mood during feeding. Findings support responsive feeding as modulating between proximal and distal responsivity, promoting autonomy, self-regulation, and enabling children to acquire and practice healthy eating behaviors.  aPublisher supplied data 3achildren 3aemotions 3afood intake 3agrowth and development 3amodels 3aquestionnaires 3aregression analysis 3aBangladesh1 aTofail, Fahmida 1 aHodges, Eric A.1 aBann, Carla M.1 aHamadani, Jena D.1 aAktar, Shirina 1 aLutter, Chessa K.0 tNutrients.g2022 July 30, v. 14, no. 15dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2271x2072-66437nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/nu141531563Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03213naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002200139245009600161300001600257520209500273592002802368650002302396650002002419650001402439650001302453650001702466650001502483650002002498650001002518650002102528650001202549650001102561650001402572650001302586650001102599700002102610773010002631856007502731852000902806655001202815IND60531003020221117034458.0160723e20120131xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053100302DNAL7 a10.1021/bi201650c2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKubiak, Rachel
L.10aStructural Studies of AntD: An N-Acyltransferase Involved in the Biosynthesis of d-Anthrose  ap. 867-878.  aThe unusual dideoxy sugar d-anthrose has been identified as an important component in the endospores of infectious agents such as Bacillus anthracis and Bacillus cereus. Specifically, it is the terminal sugar on the bacterium’s exosporium, and it provides a point of interaction between the spore and the host. The biosynthesis of d-anthrose involves numerous steps starting from α-d-glucose 1-phosphate. Here we present a combined structural and functional investigation of AntD from B. cereus. This enzyme plays a key role in d-anthrose biosynthesis by catalyzing the acylation of the C-4″ amino group of dTDP-4-amino-4,6-dideoxyglucose using 3-hydroxy-3-methylbutyryl-CoA as the acyl donor. For this investigation, two ternary complexes of AntD were determined to 1.8 Å resolution: one in which the protein contained bound β-hydroxybutyryl-CoA and dTDP and the second with CoA and dTDP-4-amino-4,6-dideoxyglucose. On the basis of these high-resolution structures, it was shown that the side chain of Asp 94 lies within hydrogen bonding distance of the sugar C-4″ amino group, and the side chain of Ser 84 resides near the carbonyl oxygen of β-hydroxybutyryl-CoA. To test the roles of these residues in the catalytic mechanism of AntD, various site-directed mutant proteins were prepared and subjected to kinetic and structural analyses. The D94A and D94N mutant proteins demonstrated enzymatic activity, albeit with significantly reduced catalytic efficiencies. The S84A mutant protein showed an approximate 10-fold decrease in activity. Interestingly, the S84C and S84T mutant proteins were both active but demonstrated substrate inhibition. The three-dimensional structures of all of the mutant proteins were nearly identical to that of the wild-type enzyme, indicating that the changes in their kinetic parameters were not due to major conformational changes. Taken together, these data suggest that Asp 94 is important for substrate binding, but probably does not function as an enzymatic base, and that Ser 84 most likely plays a role in the formation of an oxyanion hole.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacillus anthracis 3aBacillus cereus 3aacylation 3abacteria 3abiosynthesis 3aendospores 3aenzyme activity 3aexine 3ahydrogen bonding 3amutants 3aoxygen 3apathogens 3aproteins 3asugars1 aHolden, Hazel M.0 tBiochemistry.g2012 Jan. 31, v. 51, no. 4 p.867-878dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-49957nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fbi201650c3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02565naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002400152245011700176300001600293500001900309520129100328592002801619650001901647650001801666650002101684650001601705650001701721650001901738650001601757650001101773650001901784650001701803650001501820650003201835650001501867650001601882700002101898773014101919856008602060852000902146655001202155IND60694304920221118054517.0200511e20050101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069430492DNAL7 a10.1080/14620316.2005.115119682doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWeerahewa, Darshani10aHeat-induced tolerance to internal browning of pineapple (Ananas comosus cv. ‘Mauritius’) under cold storage  ap. 503-509.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aPineapple (cv. ‘Mauritius’) fruit, under low temperature (10°C) and 85% RH storage, develops internal browning symptoms. Fruit acidity, polyphenol oxidase (PPO) and peroxidase (POD) enzyme activities increased sharply, and phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL) activity increased slightly during low temperature storage, concurrent with the development of internal browning. Harvesting fruit early reduced both the incidence and severity of internal browning. Post-harvest heat-treatment, in the form of a hot water dip, induced pineapple fruit tolerance to cold injury and, in turn, reduced internal browning during prolonged low temperature storage. Several temperature-time combinations were effective, but the best was 38°C for 60 min. Pineapple fruits treated at 38°C for 60 min developed 70% and 45% less browning than untreated controls in the flesh and core regions, respectively. The results also indicate that an internal tissue temperature of 37°C is a prerequisite for the induction of cold tolerance. Heat treatment, however, slowed down fruit ripening and increased water loss. Wrapping heat-treated fruits in polythene, exposing only the crown, prior to cold-storage reduced internal browning by a further 10% and water loss by 8.5%, giving fruit a better appearance.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAnanas comosus 3abiotechnology 3acatechol oxidase 3acold injury 3acold storage 3acold tolerance 3afruit acids 3afruits 3aheat treatment 3ahorticulture 3aperoxidase 3aphenylalanine ammonia-lyase 3apineapples 3atemperature1 aAdikaram, N.K.B.0 tJournal of horticultural science & biotechnology.g2005 Jan. 1, v. 80, no. 4 p.503-509dTaylor & FranciswJournal:12181x2380-40847nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/14620316.2005.115119683Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02233naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024002800135040001800163100002300181245004100204300001800245506007600263520067400339592002801013506003701041650002501078650001701103650001601120650002301136650001801159650001701177650002501194650002601219650004701245650003601292650004201328650002301370653001001393653002301403653002101426653001601447653000801463653000901471700002001480700002201500773012201522856007401644852000901718655001201727IND60118912120221207113638.0141127e201306  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011891212DNAL7 a235807482pmid7 aPMC36956552pmcid7 a10.1093/jxb/ert0802doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKorasick, David A.10aAuxin biosynthesis and storage forms  ap. 2541-2555.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe plant hormone auxin drives plant growth and morphogenesis.

This review discusses the many ways auxin levels are regulated through biosynthesis, storage forms, and inactivation, and the potential roles modified auxins play in regulating the bioactive pool of auxin to affect plant growth and development.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abioactive properties 3abiosynthesis 3ahomeostasis 3aindole acetic acid 3amorphogenesis 3aplant growth 2aBiological Transport 2aBiosynthetic Pathways 2aIndoleacetic Acidsxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aMetabolic Networks and Pathways 2aPlant Growth Regulatorsxbiosynthesis 2aPlantsxmetabolism 0aauxin 0aauxin biosynthesis 0aauxin conjugates 0adevelopment 0aIAA 0aIBA.1 aEnders, Tara A.1 aStrader, Lucia C.0 tJournal of experimental botany.g2013 June, v. 64, no. 9 p.2541-2555dOxford University Press [etc.]x0022-09577nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jxb/ert0803Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle05254naa a2200757 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100005600145245012100201300001800322500001900340500002000359520242400379592002802803596006802831596005002899596005402949596004403003596003703047596006203084650001703146650001103163650001903174650003303193650001803226650002203244650001303266650001303279650001703292650002303309650002203332650001603354700002403370700005803394700002003452700005903472700002403531700002203555700005703577700006803634700002103702700006103723700001903784700002303803700002103826700001703847700001903864700002203883700002403905700006103929700001903990700001804009700002404027700002204051700006904073700005804142700001704200700005804217773012104275856007904396852000904475655001204484IND60699467120221121052536.0200619e202007  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069946712DNAL7 a10.1111/1365-2745.133392doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDepauw, Leen1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5703-681110aLight availability and land‐use history drive biodiversity and functional changes in forest herb layer communities  ap. 1411-1425.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aA central challenge of today's ecological research is predicting how ecosystems will develop under future global change. Accurate predictions are complicated by (a) simultaneous effects of different drivers, such as climate change, nitrogen deposition and management changes; and (b) legacy effects from previous land use. We tested whether herb layer biodiversity (i.e. richness, Shannon diversity and evenness) and functional (i.e. herb cover, specific leaf area [SLA] and plant height) responses to environmental change drivers depended on land‐use history. We used resurvey data from 192 plots across nineteen European temperate forest regions, with large spatial variability in environmental change factors. We tested for interactions between land‐use history, distinguishing ancient and recent (i.e. post‐agricultural) forests and four drivers: temperature, nitrogen deposition, and aridity at the regional scale and light dynamics at the plot‐scale. Land‐use history significantly modulated global change effects on the functional signature of the herb layer (i.e. cover, SLA and plant height). Light availability was the main environmental driver of change interacting with land‐use history. We found greater herb cover and plant height decreases and SLA increases with decreasing light availability in ancient than in recent forests. Furthermore, we found greater decreases in herb cover with increased nitrogen deposition in ancient forests, whereas warming had the strongest decreasing effect on the herb cover in recent forests. Interactive effects between land‐use history and global change on biodiversity were not found, but species evenness increased more in ancient than in recent forests. Synthesis. Our results demonstrate that land‐use history should not be overlooked when predicting forest herb layer responses to global change. Moreover, we found that herb layer composition in semi‐natural deciduous forests is mainly controlled by local canopy characteristics, regulating light levels at the forest floor, and much less by environmental changes at the regional scale (here: warming, nitrogen deposition and aridity). The observed disconnect between biodiversity and functional herb layer responses to environmental changes demonstrates the importance of assessing both types of responses to increase our understanding of the possible impact of global change on the herb layer.  aPublisher supplied data  aBLP‐370cDirectorate‐General of the State Forests in Poland  aRVO 67985939cAkademie Věd České Republiky  a17‐09283ScGrantová Agentura České Republiky  a614839cH2020 European Research Council  cFonds Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek  aAPVV‐15‐0270cAgentúra na Podporu Výskumu a Vývoja 3abiodiversity 3acanopy 3aclimate change 3adry environmental conditions 3aforest litter 3aground vegetation 3aland use 3anitrogen 3aplant height 3aspecific leaf area 3atemperate forests 3atemperature1 aPerring, Michael P.1 aLanduyt, Dries1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8107-55461 aMaes, Sybryn L.1 aBlondeel, Haben1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9939-59941 aDe Lombaerde, Emiel1 aBrūmelis, Guntis1 aBrunet, Jörg1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2667-45751 aClosset‐Kopp, Déborah1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6319-13321 aCzerepko, Janusz1 aDecocq, Guillaume1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9262-58731 aden Ouden, Jan1 aGawryś, Radosław1 aHärdtle, Werner1 aHédl, Radim1 aHeinken, Thilo1 aHeinrichs, Steffi1 aJaroszewicz, Bogdan1 aKopecký, Martin,1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1018-93161 aLiepiņa, Ilze1 aMacek, Martin1 aMáliš, František1 aSchmidt, Wolfgang1 aSmart, S.

But, due to urban lifestyle and to fulfill the basic needs, demand of electricity remains the same as in urban areas. This demand of electricity can be only fulfilled by using hybrid renewable energy resources, which is easily available in outskirts. Renewable energy resources are unreliable and more expensive. Researchers are working to make, it more reliable and economic in terms of utilization. This article proposes a metaheuristic grasshopper optimization algorithm (GOA) for the optimal sizing of hybrid PV/wind/battery energy system located in remote areas. The proposed algorithm finds the optimal sizing and configuration of remote village load demand that includes house electricity and agriculture. The optimization problem is solved by minimization of total system cost at a desirable level of loss of power supply’s reliability index (LPSRI). The results of GOA are compared with particle swarm optimization (PSO), genetic algorithm (GA) and hybrid optimization of multiple energy resources (HOMER) software. In addition, results are also validated by modeling and simulation of the hybrid energy system and its configurations at different weather conditions-based results. Hybrid PV/wind/battery is found as an optimal system at remote areas and sizing are Npv=60, Nwind=10, Nbat=40,Ninv=20.25 and Ncon=24.13 with cost of energy (COE) (0.3473$/kWh) and loss of power supplies reliability index (LPSRI) (0%). It is clear from the results that GOA based methods are more efficient for selection of optimal energy system configuration as compared to others algorithms.  aFunding The author(s) received no financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3abatteries 3acomputer software 3aelectricity 3aenergy 3aenvironment 3agrasshoppers 3alifestyle 3arenewable energy sources 3asystem optimization 3avillages 3awind 0aBattery bank 0agrasshopper optimization algorithm 0agenetic algorithms 0aparticle swarm optimization 0areliability index1 aVerma, HK0 tEnergy & environment.g2022 Aug., v. 33, no. 5 p.933-951dSAGE PublicationswJournal:26865x2048-40707nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0958305X2110301123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03511naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245020400165520176600369592002802135650002202163650001502185650001402200650001002214650001502224650002702239650001202266650002102278650001302299650003102312650001802343650001502361650001902376651001202395700002202407700002402429700002502453700002102478700001902499700002302518700003102541700002202572700001702594700001802611700001702629700001902646700002102665700002902686700002702715773012402742856008202866852000902948655001202957IND60794312220221119121124.0220922e20220907xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079431222DNAL7 a10.3390/pathogens110910212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDiallo, Bios,10aEvolution of the Ace-1 and Gste2 Mutations and Their Potential Impact on the Use of Carbamate and Organophosphates in IRS for Controlling Anopheles gambiae s.l., the Major Malaria Mosquito in Senegal  aWidespread of insecticide resistance amongst the species of the Anopheles gambiae complex continues to threaten vector control in Senegal. In this study, we investigated the presence and evolution of the Ace-1 and Gste2 resistance genes in natural populations of Anopheles gambiae s.l., the main malaria vector in Senegal. Using historical samples collected from ten sentinel health districts, this study focused on three different years (2013, 2017, and 2018) marking the periods of shift between the main public health insecticides families (pyrethroids, carbamates, organophosphates) used in IRS to track back the evolutionary history of the resistance mutations on the Ace-1 and Gste2 loci. The results revealed the presence of four members of the Anopheles gambiae complex, with the predominance of An. arabiensis followed by An. gambiae, An. coluzzii, and An. gambiae–coluzzii hybrids. The Ace-1 mutation was only detected in An. gambiae and An. gambiae–coluzzii hybrids at low frequencies varying between 0.006 and 0.02, while the Gste2 mutation was found in all the species with a frequency ranging between 0.02 and 0.25. The Ace-1 and Gste2 genes were highly diversified with twenty-two and thirty-one different haplotypes, respectively. The neutrality tests on each gene indicated a negative Tajima’s D, suggesting the abundance of rare alleles. The presence and spread of the Ace-1 and Gste2 resistance mutations represent a serious threat to of the effectiveness and the sustainability of IRS-based interventions using carbamates or organophosphates to manage the widespread pyrethroids resistance in Senegal. These data are of the highest importance to support the NMCP for evidence-based vector control interventions selection and targeting.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAnopheles gambiae 3acarbamates 3aevolution 3agenes 3ahaplotypes 3ainsecticide resistance 3amalaria 3amosquito vectors 3amutation 3aorganophosphorus compounds 3apublic health 3apyrethrins 3avector control 3aSenegal1 aKolley, Ebrima SM1 aDia, Abdoulaye Kane1 aOboh, Mary Aigbiremo1 aSeck, Fatoumata 1 aManneh, Jarra 1 aSesay, Abdul Karim1 aDiédhiou, Seynabou Macote1 aSarr, Pape Cheikh1 aSy, Ousmane 1 aSamb, Badara 1 aGaye, Oumar 1 aFaye, Ousmane 1 aKonate, Lassana,1 aAssogba, Benoit Sessinou1 aNiang, El Hadji Amadou0 tPathogens.g2022 Sept. 07, v. 11, no. 9dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27146x2076-08177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/pathogens110910213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02226naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001900145245014400164300001600308520116700324592002801491650002801519650002701547650001401574650001001588650001101598650001401609650000901623650001001632700001401642700002201656700002201678773008801700856007901788852000901867655001201876IND60347104020221118052604.0150812e201508  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6034710402DNAL7 a10.1111/1744-7917.121502doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Gang‐Hua12aA trade‐off between antipredatory behavior and pairing competition produced by male‑male tandem running in three Reticulitermes species  ap. 560-568.  aDue to the omnipresent risk of predation, termites have evolved many antipredatory behaviors. The two related species Reticulitermes speratus and R. chinensis have been demonstrated to use homosexual tandem running to decrease individual predation risk after shedding their wings. In this study, we tested risk of predation in the termite R. flaviceps, which is distantly related to the above two species. We determined that homosexual tandem running also led to low individual predation risk in dealates of R. flaviceps. Moreover, by combining a predation model with a competition model, we observed a typical trade‐off phenomenon between antipredatory behavior and pairing competition produced by male‑male tandem running in the above three Reticulitermes species. Our results indicated that male‑male tandem running could effectively protect disadvantaged individuals from being caught, but disadvantaged individuals would be easily eliminated in pairing competition after male‑male tandem running, suggesting that male‑male tandem running can promote population evolution in termites by repeatedly removing the relatively inferior male individuals.  aPublisher supplied data 3aReticulitermes speratus 3aantipredatory behavior 3aevolution 3amales 3amodels 3apredation 3arisk 3awings1 aLiu, Long1 aLei, Chao‐Liang1 aHuang, Qiu‐Ying0 tInsect science.g2015 Aug., v. 22, no. 4 p.560-568dBlackwell Pub.x1672-96097nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1744-7917.121503Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01402naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001400140245016600154300001800320520039600338592002800734650002400762650001100786650002300797650001500820700001800835700001400853700001700867773013300884856007401017852000901091655001201100IND60660244320221120054116.0190823e20140708xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066024432DNAL7 a10.1039/c4cc03462g2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Shen10a[3+3] annulation of allylic phosphoryl-stabilized carbanions/phosphorus ylides and vinyl azides: a practice strategy for synthesis of polyfunctionalized anilines  ap. 8539-8542.  aTandem Michael addition and Witting or Horner–Wadsworth–Emmons olefination initiated [3+3] annulation between vinyl azides and allylic phosphorus ylides or allylic phosphoryl-stabilized carbanions has been developed.

However, producing biofuels from microalgae is still not economically viable. Therefore, the integration of biofuel production with other microalgal applications, such as CO2 capture and nutrient removal from wastewaters, would reduce the microalgal production costs (and the environmental impact of cultures), increasing the economic viability of the whole process. Additionally, producing biofuels from microalgae strongly depends on microalgal strain and culture conditions.This study evaluates the effect of culture conditions, namely light irradiance (36, 60, 120 and 180μEm⁻²s⁻¹) and light:dark ratio (10:14, 14:10 and 24:0), on microalgal growth, atmospheric CO2 uptake and nutrient (nitrogen and phosphorous) removal from culture medium. Four different microalgal strains, Chlorella vulgaris, Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata, Synechocystis salina and Microcystis aeruginosa, were studied to ascertain the most advantageous regarding the referred applications.This study has shown that higher light irradiance values and light periods resulted in higher specific growth rates and CO2 uptake rates. C. vulgaris presented the highest specific growth rate and CO2 uptake rate: 1.190±0.041d⁻¹ and 0.471±0.047gCO2L⁻¹d⁻¹, respectively. All the strains have shown high nitrogen removal efficiencies, reaching 100% removal percentages in cultures with higher light supply. Phosphorus removal increased with light irradiance and with light:dark ratio. The highest removal efficiency, 67.6±7.1%, was achieved by the microalga C. vulgaris.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChlorella vulgaris 3aMicrocystis aeruginosa 3aSelenastrum capricornutum 3aSynechocystis 3abiofuels 3acarbon dioxide 3aculture media 3aeconomic sustainability 3aenvironmental impact 3afossil fuels 3afuel production 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3alight intensity 3amicroalgae 3anitrogen 3aphosphorus 3aproduction costs 3aspecific growth rate 3awastewater 0aAtmospheric CO2 capture 0aLight:dark ratio 0aLight irradiance 0aMicroalgal based biofuels 0aNitrogen and phosphorus uptake1 aSimões, M.1 aPires, J.C.M.0 tEnergy conversion and management.g2014 Sept., v. 85 p.530-536dElsevier LtdwJournal:11831x0196-89047nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enconman.2014.05.0853Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02274naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002300145245010500168300001600273520110800289592002801397650001901425650001101444650002101455650002401476650001001500650002001510650002201530650002101552650002701573650001501600651001401615651001301629651001401642700002301656700002101679773008801700856007901788852000901867655001201876IND60347104620221118052636.0150812e201508  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6034710462DNAL7 a10.1111/1744-7917.121292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDíaz, Fernandito,10aGenetic structure of the whitefly Bemisia tabaci populations in Colombia following a recent invasion  ap. 483-494.  aThe whitefly Bemisia tabaci (Gennadius) is one of the most important pests causing economic losses in a variety of cropping systems around the world. This species was recently found in a coastal region of Colombia and has now spread inland. To investigate this invasive process, the genetic structure of B. tabaci was examined in 8 sampling locations from 2 infested regions (coastal, inland) using 9 microsatellite markers and the mitochondrial COI gene. The mitochondrial analysis indicated that only the invasive species of the B. tabaci complex Middle East–Asia Minor 1 (MEAM 1 known previously as biotype B) was present. The microsatellite data pointed to genetic differences among the regions and no isolation by distance within regions. The coastal region in the Caribbean appears to have been the initial point of invasion, while the inland region in the Southwest showed genetic variation among populations most likely reflecting founder events and ongoing changes associated with climatic and topographical heterogeneity. These findings have implications for tracking and managing B. tabaci.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBemisia tabaci 3acoasts 3acropping systems 3afinancial economics 3agenes 3agenetic markers 3agenetic variation 3ainvasive species 3amicrosatellite repeats 3apopulation 3aCaribbean 3aColombia 3aEast Asia1 aEndersby, Nancy M.1 aHoffmann, Ary A.0 tInsect science.g2015 Aug., v. 22, no. 4 p.483-494dBlackwell Pub.x1672-96097nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1744-7917.121293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03276naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002100143245012600164500001400290520186000304592002802164650001802192650002502210650001702235650001302252650001502265650001002280650001702290650002002307650001602327650001902343650001502362650001302377650003102390650001202421650002702433650002102460650001702481650000902498650001402507650001102521700002602532700002402558773012602582856007702708852000902785655001202794IND60711632120221119025418.0200928e20200917xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071163212DNAL7 a10.3390/antiox90908772doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBratek, Ewelina 10aN-Acetylaspartylglutamate (NAAG) Pretreatment Reduces Hypoxic-Ischemic Brain Damage and Oxidative Stress in Neonatal Rats  aNAL-light  aN-acetylaspartylglutamate (NAAG), the most abundant peptide transmitter in the mammalian nervous system, activates mGluR3 at presynaptic sites, inhibiting the release of glutamate, and acts on mGluR3 on astrocytes, stimulating the release of neuroprotective growth factors (TGF-β). NAAG can also affect N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptors in both synaptic and extrasynaptic regions. NAAG reduces neurodegeneration in a neonatal rat model of hypoxia-ischemia (HI), although the exact mechanism is not fully recognized. In the present study, the effect of NAAG application 24 or 1 h before experimental birth asphyxia on oxidative stress markers and the potential mechanisms of neuroprotection on 7-day old rats was investigated. The intraperitoneal application of NAAG at either time point before HI significantly reduced the weight deficit of the ischemic brain hemisphere, radical oxygen species (ROS) content and activity of antioxidant enzymes, and increased the concentration of reduced glutathione (GSH). No additional increase in the TGF-β concentration was observed after NAAG application. The fast metabolism of NAAG and the decrease in TGF-β concentration that resulted from NAAG pretreatment, performed up to 24 h before HI, excluded the involvement mGluR3 in neuroprotection. The observed effect may be explained by the activation of NMDA receptors induced by NAAG pretreatment 24 h before HI. Inhibition of the NAAG effect by memantine supports this conclusion. NAAG preconditioning 1 h before HI results in a mixture of mGluR3 and NMDA receptor activation. Preconditioning with NAAG induces the antioxidative defense system triggered by mild excitotoxicity in neurons. Moreover, this response to NAAG pretreatment is consistent with the commonly accepted mechanism of preconditioning. However, this theory requires further investigation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal models 3aantioxidant activity 3aantioxidants 3aasphyxia 3aastrocytes 3abrain 3abrain damage 3aenzyme activity 3aglutathione 3agrowth factors 3ametabolism 3aneonates 3aneurodegenerative diseases 3aneurons 3aneuroprotective effect 3aoxidative stress 3apretreatment 3arats 3areceptors 3aweight1 aZiembowicz, Apolonia 1 aSalinska, Elzbieta 0 tAntioxidants.g2020 Sept. 17, v. 9, no. 9dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27130x2076-39217nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/antiox90908773Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01507naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001400140245012300154300001800277520036100295592002800656650002300684650002300707650002900730650002400759650001100783650001900794650001700813650001400830650001000844700001700854700001900871700001400890700001200904773013400916856007401050852000901124655001201133IND60660244520221120054029.0190823e20140717xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066024452DNAL7 a10.1039/c4cc03466j2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXu, Linru10aElectrochemiluminescence imaging of latent fingermarks through the immunodetection of secretions in human perspiration  ap. 9097-9100.  aWe present the combination of electrochemiluminescence imaging with enzyme immunoassay for the highly sensitive detection of protein/polypeptide residues in latent fingermarks.

We previously found that NS5A is able to down-regulate HCV RNA translation through a mechanism requiring the polyU/UC region within the viral 3′UTR to which NS5A binds. In this study, we further investigated the role of domain I in modulating viral translation. Using a series of deletion and substitution mutants, we identified a number of positively charged residues that played a role in this modulatory effect, most prominently R112. The R112A mutation negated the ability of domain I and full-length NS5A to modulate viral translation. Additionally, the R112A mutation impeded domain I binding to the polyU/UC RNA, suggesting a mechanism for this down-regulatory effect. Finally, the R112A mutation rendered HCV replication deficient. These results collectively point to a crucial role for the R112 residue of NS5A in the modulation of HCV life cycle by NS5A.  aPublisher supplied data 3a3' untranslated regions 3aarginine 3amutants 3amutation 3atranslation (genetics) 0aHCV NS5A domain I 0aHCV RNA translation 0aRNA binding 0aHCV replication 0a3′UTR1 aShi, Qing1 aLiu, Qiang1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1508-71720 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2015 Sept. 11, v. 465 p.95-100dElsevier Inc.x0006-291X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2015.07.1363Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03610naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002000143245013300163500001400296520211000310592002802420650001402448650003002462650002102492650002402513650001602537650001002553650001702563650001002580650001402590650001602604650001302620650001402633650000902647650001302656650002202669650000902691650001402700650001002714650002802724650001602752650002902768700002102797700002102818700002002839700002202859773012502881856007703006852000903083655001203092IND60711632320221119024103.0200928e20200822xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071163232DNAL7 a10.3390/antiox90907802doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Ing-Jung 14aThe Circadian Hormone Melatonin Inhibits Morphine-Induced Tolerance and Inflammation via the Activation of Antioxidative Enzymes  aNAL-light  aOpioids are commonly prescribed for clinical pain management; however, dose-escalation, tolerance, dependence, and addiction limit their usability for long-term chronic pain. The associated poor sleep pattern alters the circadian neurobiology, and further compromises the pain management. Here, we aim to determine the correlation between constant light exposure and morphine tolerance and explore the potential of melatonin as an adjuvant of morphine for neuropathic pain treatment. Methods: Wistar rats were preconditioned under constant light (LL) or a regular light/dark (LD) cycle before neuropathic pain induction by chronic constriction injury. An intrathecal (i.t.) osmotic pump was used for continued drug delivery to induce morphine tolerance. Pain assessments, including the plantar test, static weight-bearing symmetry, and tail-flick latency, were used to determine the impact of the light disruption or exogenous melatonin on the morphine tolerance progression. Results: constant light exposure significantly aggravates morphine tolerance in neuropathic rats. Continued infusion of low-dose melatonin (3 μg/h) attenuated morphine tolerance in both neuropathic and naïve rats. This protective effect was independent of melatonin receptors, as shown by the neutral effect of melatonin receptors inhibitors. The transcriptional profiling demonstrated a significant enhancement of proinflammatory and pain-related receptor genes in morphine-tolerant rats. In contrast, this transcriptional pattern was abolished by melatonin coinfusion along with the upregulation of the Kcnip3 gene. Moreover, melatonin increased the antioxidative enzymes SOD2, HO-1, and GPx1 in the spinal cord of morphine-tolerant rats. Conclusion: Dysregulated circadian light exposure significantly compromises the efficacy of morphine’s antinociceptive effect, while the cotreatment with melatonin attenuates morphine tolerance/hyperalgesia development. Our results suggest the potential of melatonin as an adjuvant of morphine in clinical pain management, particularly in patients who need long-term opioid treatment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadjuvants 3aadministrative management 3aanalgesic effect 3aantioxidant enzymes 3acorrelation 3agenes 3ainflammation 3alight 3amelatonin 3amethodology 3amorphine 3anarcotics 3apain 3apatients 3aprotective effect 3arats 3areceptors 3asleep 3asomatosensory disorders 3aspinal cord 3atranscription (genetics)1 aYang, Chih-Ping 1 aLin, Shengxiong,1 aLai, Chang-Mei 1 aWong, Chih-Shung 0 tAntioxidants.g2020 Aug. 22, v. 9, no. 9dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27130x2076-39217nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/antiox90907803Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02882naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001500144245015000159300001800309520155900327592002801886650002601914650001501940650001701955650001801972650001601990653002602006653002002032653002002052653003802072653003402110653002302144700002002167700001802187700001602205700001902221700001902240773012402259856008002383852000902463655001202472IND60564317020221119044541.0170318e20170315xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056431702DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.6b147022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHa, Jewook10aOne-Step Interface Engineering for All-Inkjet-Printed, All-Organic Components in Transparent, Flexible Transistors and Inverters: Polymer Binding  ap. 8819-8829.  aWe report a one-step interface engineering methodology which can be used on both polymer electrodes and gate dielectric for all-inkjet-printed, flexible, transparent organic thin-film transistors (OTFTs) and inverters. Dimethylchlorosilane-terminated polystyrene (PS) was introduced as a surface modifier to cured poly(4-vinylphenol) dielectric and poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):polystyrenesulfonate (PEDOT:PSS) electrodes without any pretreatment. On the untreated and PS interlayer-treated dielectric and electrode surfaces, 6,13-bis(triisopropylsilylethynyl)pentacene was printed to fabricate OTFTs and inverters. With the benefit of the PS interlayer, the electrical properties of the OTFTs on a flexible plastic substrate were significantly improved, as shown by a field-effect mobility (μFET) of 0.27 cm² V–¹ s–¹ and an on/off current ratio (Iₒₙ/Iₒff) of greater than 10⁶. In contrast, the untreated systems showed a low μFET of less than 0.02 cm² V–¹ s–¹ and Iₒₙ/Iₒff ∼ 10⁴. Additionally, the all-inkjet-printed inverters based on the PS-modified surfaces exhibited a voltage gain of 7.17 V V–¹. The all-organic-based TFTs and inverters, including deformable and transparent PEDOT:PSS electrodes with a sheet resistance of 160–250 Ω sq–¹, exhibited a light transmittance of higher than 70% (at wavelength of 550 nm). Specifically, there was no significant degradation in the electrical performance of the interface engineering-assisted system after 1000 bending cycles at a radius of 5 mm.  aPublisher supplied data 3aelectrical properties 3aelectrodes 3apolystyrenes 3atransmittance 3awavelengths 0ainterface engineering 0ainkjet printing 0apolymer binding 0atransparent thin-film transistors 0aorganic thin-film transistors 0apolymer electrodes1 aChung, Seungjun1 aPei, Mingyuan1 aCho, Kilwon1 aYang, Hoichang1 aHong, Yongtaek0 tACS Applied Materials & Interfaces.g2017 Mar. 15, v. 9, no. 10 p.8819-8829dAmerican Chemical Societyx1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facsami.6b147023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02991naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024005700094040001800151100002200169245012400191300001600315520185100331592002802182653002202210653001802232653001602250653002402266700002302290700001902313700002302332700002302355700002002378773015502398856010302553852000902656655001202665IND60131636420221120104019.0151127e200212  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013163642DNAL7 a10.1638/1042-7260(2002)033[0301:OAWSES]2.0.CO;22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRamsay, Edward C.10aOsteomyelitis associated with salmonella enterica ss arizonae in a colony of ridgenose rattlesnakes (crotalus willardi)  ap. 301-310.  aThe identification of three Arizona ridgenose rattlesnakes (Crotalus willardi) with Salmonella arizonae––associated osteomyelitis led to a 5-yr prospective study of radiographic signs and Salmonella intestinal carriage rates in a 19-member colony of this rattlesnake species. Ventrodorsal radiographs were performed and cloacal swabs were cultured for Salmonella spp. annually. Ten snakes survived the 5-yr period, with six of them remaining free of bony lesions. Three snakes that had no bony lesions in 1995 developed radiographic signs of osteomyelitis during the study. Six snakes with bony lesions at the beginning of the study died or were euthanatized due to osteomyelitis during the study. The radiographic signs of osteomyelitis were progressive for five snakes that were serially radiographed. Only one snake with radiographic signs of osteomyelitis at the beginning of the study was still alive at the end of the study, and this animal's bony lesions were more extensive at the end. Thirty-nine intestinal S. arizonae isolates, representing 13 serotypes, were obtained from the 19 snakes. Salmonella arizonae serotype 56:Z4,Z23 was isolated only once from a cloacal culture, from a snake that had no radiographic bone lesions. Twelve extraintestinal Salmonella isolates, representing two serotypes, were isolated from six snakes. All extraintestinal isolates except one were of S. arizonae serotype 56:Z4,Z23, and all isolates from bone were of this serotype. One snake with characteristic bone lesions died, and Providencia rettgeri was cultured from each of the tissues cultured, whereas no Salmonella spp. were isolated from this snake. Salmonella arizonae serotype 56:Z4,Z24 appears to have a tropism for bone and other extraintestinal sites in C. willardi and may cause a progressive, ultimately fatal disease in this species.  aPublisher supplied data 0aCrotalus willardi 0aosteomyelitis 0arattlesnake 0aSalmonella arizonae1 aDaniel, Gregory B.1 aTryon, Bern W.1 aMerryman, Joyce I.1 aMorris, Patrick J.1 aBemis, David A.0 tJournal of zoo and wildlife medicine.g2002 Dec., v. 33, no. 4 p.301-310dAmerican Association of Zoo VeterinarianswJournal:jnl43569x1937-28257nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1638/1042-7260(2002)033[0301:OAWSES]2.0.CO;23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03374naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094024002200126024001900148040001800167100006200185245014400247300002000391506007600411520160200487592002802089506003702117650001602154650002502170650001302195650003402208650001602242650001402258650001502272650001202287653001302299653003402312653002102346653002602367653002302393653001702416653001202433700006902445700002202514700001702536700006002553700002602613773014202639856007802781852000902859655001202868IND60655129020221207053505.0190731e20190703xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065512902DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.9b035952doi7 aPMC66800872pmcid7 a312677422pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBoys, Alexander J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6488-700510aUnderstanding the Stiff-to-Compliant Transition of the Meniscal Attachments by Spatial Correlation of Composition, Structure, and Mechanics  ap. 26559-26570.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aRecently, the scientific community has shown considerable interest in engineering tissues with organized compositional and structural gradients to mimic hard-to-soft tissue interfaces. This effort is hindered by an incomplete understanding of the construction of native tissue interfaces. In this work, we combined Raman microscopy and confocal elastography to map compositional, structural, and mechanical features across the stiff-to-compliant interface of the attachments of the meniscus in the knee. This study provides new insight into the methods by which biology mediates multiple orders of magnitude changes in stiffness over tens of microns. We identified how the nano- to mesoscale architecture mediates complex microscale transitional regions across the interface: two regions defined by chemical composition, five distinguished by structural features, and three mechanically distinct regions. We identified three major components that lead to a robust interface between a soft tissue and bone: mobile collagen fiber units, a continuous interfacial region, and a local stiffness gradient. This tissue architecture allows for large displacements of collagen fibers in the attachments, enabling meniscal movement without localizing strains to the soft tissue-to-bone interface. The interplay of these regions reveals a method relying on hierarchical structuring across multiple length scales to minimize stress concentrators between highly dissimilar materials. These insights inspire new design strategies for synthetic soft tissue-to-bone attachments and biomimetic material interfaces.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abiomimetics 3achemical composition 3acollagen 3aelasticity imaging techniques 3aengineering 3amechanics 3amicroscopy 3atissues 0aenthesis 0asoft tissue-to-bone interface 0atissue gradients 0amechanical properties 0aRaman spectroscopy 0aelastography 0amapping1 aKunitake, Jennie A.

C.14aTHE presence of fungi associated with sick building syndrome in north american zoological institutions  ap. 322-327.  aA total of 110 sites from five zoological institutions were examined to determine whether fungi associated with sick building syndrome (SBS) were prevalent in the exhibits or night-time holding facilities and to investigate whether the presence of these organisms was associated with declining breeding rates or increases in morbidity and mortality (or both). Each site was sampled with an Andersen two-stage air sampler using Sabourauds dextrose agar media and a Burkard personal volumetric air sampler. Suspect surfaces were also sampled. High levels of airborne Penicillium chrysogenum, a fungal species associated with poor indoor air quality, were recovered from 16 sites out of all five institutions. Five culturable growth sites of Stachybotrys chartarum, a species strongly associated with SBS and commonly known as ““black mold,”” were recovered from surfaces at two institutions. A wide range of other fungal species was recovered in low numbers from all institutions. A Fisher exact test analysis showed a significant nonrandom association between high levels of P. chrysogenum and sites with records of poor animal health. This study indicated that significant numbers of airborne fungi associated with SBS and poor indoor air quality are present in zoological institutions and that they could affect animal health and reproduction rates and zoo staff.  aPublisher supplied data 0aFungi 0azoo 0aairborne 0asick building syndrome 0ablack mold1 aStraus, D.

The occurrence of this species in the south-central Pampean region between 4700 and 200 ka cal BP was originally associated with some warm climatic episodes. A later hypothesis points out that P. simplex was a typical element of the Humid Pampa subregion during this period, whose distribution was retracted to the north due to the strong anthropic modifications in the area. To corroborate these hypotheses, the niche of occurrence of P. simplex was calculated to analyse the preferred climatic conditions of contemporaneous and fossil record of the species since 4700 ka cal BP. The derived climatic niche of P. simplex shows a marked preference for areas with seasonality precipitation patterns and tropical/subtropical conditions. Geographical estimations and climatic niches derived revealed a moderate overlapping between contemporaneous and Pampean late-Holocene projection, which in no case includes the localities where fossil data were found. Although a better comprehension of the ecological requirements of the species is necessary to discard a shift in its realized climatic niche, it is probable that P. simplex is able to maintain stable populations under similar conditions to the ones represented by fossil occurrences. The distribution of the species in the Humid Pampa subregion is probably affected by non-climatic factors today which are reducing its contemporaneous realized climatic niche and distorting the derived climatic niches obtained. These results support that this species cannot be considered a reliable palaeoclimatic indicator of more Brazilian conditions in the Humid Pampean subregion during the past.  aFunding The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This work was supported by the Ministerio de Ciencia, Innovación y Universidades [Project CGL2016-79334P], the Universidad Nacional de La Plata [Project 11/N769], the Universidad Nacional de la Pampa [Project 13G] and the Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Científicas de Cooperación Internacional [Project i-COOPB-20287].

Recently, there has been a growing need and interest in healthier food products, which has led to an increased interest in natural preservatives, such as essential oils, plant extracts, and edible films and coatings. Several studies have shown the potential of using biopreservation, natural antimicrobials, and antioxidant agents in place of other processing and preservation techniques (e.g., thermal and non-thermal treatments, freezing, or synthetic chemicals). Changes in food quality induced by the application of natural preservatives have been commonly evaluated using a range of traditional methods, including microbiology, sensory, and physicochemical measurements.

Here, we used a novel and efficient synthesis approach to develop radioiodine-124-labeled tannic acid gold core–shell nanoparticles (¹²⁴I-TA-Au@AuNPs) for DC labeling and in vivo tracking of their migration using positron emission tomography (PET). ¹²⁴I-TA-Au@AuNPs were produced within 40 min in high yield via straightforward tannic acid-mediated radiolabeling chemistry and incorporation of Au shell, which resulted in high radio-sensitivity and excellent chemical stability of nanoparticles in DCs and living mice. ¹²⁴I-TA-Au@AuNPs demonstrated good DC labeling efficiency and did not affect cell biological functions, including proliferation and phenotype marker expression. Importantly, ¹²⁴I-TA-Au@AuNPs in an extremely low amount (0.1 mg/kg) were successfully applied to track the migration of DCs to lymphoid organs (draining lymph nodes) in mice.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemistry 3adendritic cells 3aengineering 3agold 3aimage analysis 3aimmunotherapy 3alymph nodes 3amedicine 3amice 3ananoparticles 3aphenotype 3apositron-emission tomography 3aradiolabeling 3atannins 0adendritic cells 0acell tracking 0atannic acid 0afunctionalized gold core−shell nanoparticles 0adetection limit 0aPET imaging1 aLee, Sang-Woo1 aJeong, Shin Young1 aYoon, GhilSuk1 aCho, Sung Jin1 aKim, Sang Kyoon1 aLee, In-Kyu1 aAhn, Byeong-Cheol1 aLee, Jaetae1 aJeon, Yong Hyun0 tACS Applied Materials & Interfaces.g2017 Mar. 15, v. 9, no. 10 p.8480-8489dAmerican Chemical Societyx1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facsami.6b148003Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02722naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001800144245011600162300002000278520139600298592002801694650001101722650001401733650001301747650002101760650001701781650002101798650001701819650001901836650002201855650002101877650001201898653001101910653002801921653001801949653002401967700001901991700006102010773014202071856007802213852000902291655001202300IND60655129220221120190224.0190731e20190705xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065512922DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.9b038662doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJung, Chul-Ho10aStable Silicon Anode for Lithium-Ion Batteries through Covalent Bond Formation with a Binder via Esterification  ap. 26753-26763.  aSilicon (Si) is considered to be one of the most promising anode candidates for next-generation lithium-ion batteries because of its high theoretical specific capacity and low discharge potential. However, its poor cyclability, caused by tremendous volume change during cycling, prevents commercial use of the Si anode. Herein, we demonstrate a high-performance Si anode produced via covalent bond formation between a commercially available Si nanopowder and a linear polymeric binder through an esterification reaction. For efficient ester bonding, polyacrylic acid, composed of −COOH groups, is selected as the binder, Si is treated with piranha solution to produce abundant −OH groups on its surface, and sodium hypophosphite is employed as a catalyst. The as-fabricated electrode exhibits excellent high rate capability and long cycle stability, delivering a high capacity of 1500 mA h g–¹ after 500 cycles at a high current density of 1000 mA g–¹ by effectively restraining the susceptible sliding of the binder, stabilizing the solid electrolyte interface layer, preventing the electrode delamination, and suppressing the Si aggregation. Furthermore, a full cell is fabricated with as-fabricated Si as an anode and commercially available LiNi₀.₆Mn₀.₂Co₀.₂O₂ as a cathode, and its electrochemical properties are investigated for the possibility of practical use.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanodes 3acatalysts 3acathodes 3achemical bonding 3adelamination 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrolytes 3aesterification 3alithium batteries 3apolyacrylic acid 3asilicon 0abinder 0aesterification reaction 0acovalent bond 0alithium-ion battery1 aKim, Kyeong-Ho1 aHong, Seong-Hyeon1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8350-27240 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2019 July 05, v. 11, no. 30 p.26753-26763dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.9b038663Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04617naa a2200805 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003800111040001800149100002000167245027600187300001600463520184100479592002802320650002502348650001702373650001602390650001102406650001302417650001602430650001202446650001902458650001902477650002002496650001002516650001002526650001102536650001702547650002102564650002802585650000902613650001402622650000902636650001102645650001902656650001602675650002502691650004602716650001202762650002902774650003002803650007302833650002502906650002002931650002002951650003602971650005403007650003403061650004503095650006403140650006403204650003503268650001803303650000903321650000903330650002503339650005303364650002403417650007103441650003703512700002203549700002303571700002003594773009203614856008403706852000903790655001203799IND4470729620221119055215.0141112e201112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447072962DNAL7 a221535182pmid7 a10.1016/j.nutres.2011.09.0272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMarsh, Tanya G.10aSoy protein supports cardiovascular health by downregulating hydroxymethylglutaryl–coenzyme A reductase and sterol regulatory element-binding protein–2 and increasing antioxidant enzyme activity in rats with dextran sodium sulfate–induced mild systemic inflammation  ap. 922-928.  aAnimal and human studies have indicated that the presence of soy in the diet improves cardiovascular health. Inflammation plays a pivotal role in the progression of cardiovascular disease (CVD). However, little is known about how dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)–induced systemic inflammation impacts overall heart health and, correspondingly, how soy protein modulates risk of CVD development in DSS-induced systemic inflammation. We hypothesized that soy protein–fed rats would have a lower risk of CVD by beneficial alteration of gene expression involving lipid metabolism and antioxidant capacity in DSS-induced systemic inflammation. Forty Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into 4 groups: casein, casein + DSS, soy protein, and soy protein + DSS. After 26 days, inflammation was induced in one group from each diet by incorporating 3% DSS in drinking water for 48 hours. Soy protein–fed rats had lower final body weights (P = .010), epididymal fat weights (P = .049), total cholesterol (P < .001), and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (P < .001). In regard to gene expression, soy protein–fed rats had lower sterol regulatory element-binding protein–2 (P = .032) and hydroxymethylglutaryl–coenzyme A reductase (P = .028) levels and higher low-density lipoprotein receptor levels (P = .036). Antioxidant enzyme activity of superoxide dismutase and catalase was higher among the soy protein groups (P = .037 and P = .002, respectively). These results suggest that soy protein positively influences cardiovascular health by regulating serum lipids through modified expression of sterol regulatory element-binding protein–2 and its downstream genes (ie, hydroxymethylglutaryl–coenzyme A reductase and low-density lipoprotein receptor) and by promoting the antioxidant enzyme activity of superoxide dismutase and catalase.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantioxidant activity 3ablood lipids 3abody weight 3acasein 3acatalase 3acholesterol 3adextran 3adisease course 3adrinking water 3agene expression 3agenes 3aheart 3ahumans 3ainflammation 3alipid metabolism 3alow density lipoprotein 3arats 3areceptors 3arisk 3asodium 3asodium sulfate 3asoy protein 3asuperoxide dismutase 2aAdipose Tissuexdrug effectsxmetabolism. 2aAnimals 2aAntioxidantsxmetabolism 2aBody Weightxdrug effects 2aCardiovascular Diseasesxetiologyxmetabolismxprevention & control. 2aCatalasexmetabolism 2aDextran Sulfate 2aDown-Regulation 2aEnzyme Activationxdrug effects 2aEnzyme Inhibitorsxpharmacologyxtherapeutic use. 2aGene Expressionxdrug effects 2aGene Expression Regulationxdrug effects 2aHydroxymethylglutaryl CoA Reductasesxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aInflammationxchemically inducedxdrug therapyxmetabolism. 2aLipid Metabolismxdrug effects 2aLipidsxblood 2aMale 2aRats 2aRats, Sprague-Dawley 2aSoybean Proteinsxpharmacologyxtherapeutic use. 2aSoybeansxchemistry 2aSterol Regulatory Element Binding Protein 2xgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aSuperoxide Dismutasexmetabolism1 aStraub, Rachel K.1 aVillalobos, Fatima1 aHong, Mee Young0 tNutrition research.g2011 Dec., v. 31, no. 12 p.922-928dElsevier Inc.x0271-53177nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.nutres.2011.09.0273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02650naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001300139245015900152300001600311520146900327592002801796650001801824650002001842650001901862650002601881650001501907650001801922650001401940650001401954650001901968651001001987700002201997700002002019700001502039700001902054773010902073856007302182852000902255655001202264IND60347106820221118052551.0150812e201507  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6034710682DNAL7 a10.1111/jse.121442doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBai, Xue10aIntraspecific differentiation of Pleurospermum hookeri (Apiaceae), and its interspecific relationships with two close relatives in the genus Pleurospermum  ap. 308-320.  aIn order to clarify the interspecific relationships of a lineage in Pleurospermum, P. hookeri C. B. Clarke, P. yunnanense Franch., and P. giraldii Diels, and to understand intraspecific divergence of P. hookeri, a phylogeographic study was carried out based on 198 individuals from 24 populations. Three chloroplast DNA regions, ndhF‐rpl32, trnL‐trnF, and trnQ‐rps16, were sequenced in the present study. The genetic relationship between P. hookeri and P. giraldii is not as close as previously assumed. Pleurospermum hookeri and P. giraldii may originate from an unknown ancestor located in the Qinling region. Pleurospermum yunnanense was found to be the closest relative of P. hookeri in all the species included in the phylogenetic analysis. The two haplotypes identified from P. yunnanense are shared with P. hookeri, which is potentially a result of both incomplete linkage sorting and introgression. Three large divergences within P. hookeri were identified, located at the northeastern edge, southeastern edge, and platform of the Qinghai–Tibet Plateau (QTP), respectively. Long‐term history can explain the deep intraspecific divergence of P. hookeri. The uplift of the QTP played a key role in that divergence, and then were the climatic changes in the Quaternary. In addition, we found one refugium at the northeastern edge of the QTP, one at the southeastern edge, and at least one in the Hengduan Mountains region on the platform of the QTP.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPleurospermum 3achloroplast DNA 3aclimate change 3agenetic relationships 3ahaplotypes 3aintrogression 3amountains 3aphylogeny 3aphylogeography 3aChina1 aMa, Xiang‐Guang1 aGao, Yun‐Dong1 aZhao, Zai,1 aHe, Xing‐Jin0 tJournal of systematics and evolution.g2015 July, v. 53, no. 4 p.308-320dScience Pressx1674-49187nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jse.121443Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03636naa a2200661 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245011600166300001600282520178700298592002802085650001702113650001902130650001602149650001902165650001902184650001702203650002302220650001802243650001602261650001602277650002102293650001802314650001302332650001302345650001702358650004002375653002702415653001902442653000902461653001602470653001902486653000802505653000802513653000702521653000802528653000902536653000902545653000802554653000902562653000902571700002102580700002402601700001802625700001802643700002602661700002602687700001602713700002002729773012202749856008202871852000902953655001202962IND60533233020221121065556.0160728e20150911xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053323302DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbrc.2015.07.1432doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSaygili, Erol10aAutoantibodies in dilated cardiomyopathy induce vascular endothelial growth factor expression in cardiomyocytes  ap. 119-124.  aAutoantibodies have been identified as major predisposing factors for dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). Patients with DCM show elevated serum levels of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) whose source is unknown. Besides its well-investigated effects on angiogenesis, evidence is present that VEGF signaling is additionally involved in fibroblast proliferation and cardiomyocyte hypertrophy, hence in cardiac remodeling. Whether autoimmune effects in DCM impact cardiac VEGF signaling needs to be elucidated.Five DCM patients were treated by the immunoadsorption (IA) therapy on five consecutive days. The eluents from the IA columns were collected and prepared for cell culture. Cardiomyocytes from neonatal rats (NRCM) were incubated with increasing DCM-immunoglobulin-G (IgG) concentrations for 48 h. Polyclonal IgG (Venimmun N), which was used to restore IgG plasma levels in DCM patients after the IA therapy was additionally used for control cell culture purposes.Elevated serum levels of VEGF decreased significantly after IA (Serum VEGF (ng/ml); DCM pre-IA: 45 ± 9.1 vs. DCM post–IA: 29 ± 6.7; P < 0.05). In cell culture, pretreatment of NRCM by DCM-IgG induced VEGF expression in a time and dose dependent manner. Biologically active VEGF that was secreted by NRCM significantly increased BNP mRNA levels in control cardiomyocytes and induced cell-proliferation of cultured cardiac fibroblast (Fibroblast proliferation; NRCM medium/HC-IgG: 1 ± 0.0 vs. NRCM medium/DCM-IgG 100 ng/ml: 5.6 ± 0.9; P < 0.05).The present study extends the knowledge about the possible link between autoimmune signaling in DCM and VEGF induction. Whether this observation plays a considerable role in cardiac remodeling during DCM development needs to be further elucidated.  aPublisher supplied data 3aangiogenesis 3aautoantibodies 3ablood serum 3acardiomyocytes 3acardiomyopathy 3acell culture 3acell proliferation 3adose response 3afibroblasts 3ahypertrophy 3aimmunoglobulin G 3amessenger RNA 3aneonates 3apatients 3atherapeutics 3avascular endothelial growth factors 0aDilated cardiomyopathy 0aAutoantibodies 0aVEGF 0aHypertrophy 0aCardiomyocytes 0aDCM 0aICM 0aIA 0aIgG 0aLVEF 0aVEGF 0aBNP 0aNRCM 0aNYHA1 aNoor-Ebad, Fawad1 aSchröder, Jörg W.1 aMischke, Karl1 aSaygili, Esra1 aRackauskas, Gediminas1 aMarx, N.q(Nikolaus),1 aKelm, Malte1 aRana, Obaida R.0 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2015 Sept. 11, v. 465 p.119-124dElsevier Inc.x0006-291X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2015.07.1433Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02103naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100001700142245012000159300002000279520096600299592002801265650001501293650001301308650001801321650001401339650001301353650002001366650001301386700001601399700001701415700001701432700001801449700002101467700001901488773013501507856007801642852000901720655001201729IND60541622120170628000000.0160822e20150923xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054162212DNAL7 a10.1021/jacs.5b071862doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYan, Juanzhu10aTotal Structure and Electronic Structure Analysis of Doped Thiolated Silver [MAg24(SR)18]2– (M = Pd, Pt) Clusters  ap. 11880-11883.  aWith the incorporation of Pd or Pt atoms, thiolated Ag-rich 25-metal-atom nanoclusters were successfully prepared and structurally characterized for the first time. With a composition of [PdAg₂₄(SR)₁₈]²– or [PtAg₂₄(SR)₁₈]²–, the obtained 25-metal-atom nanoclusters have a metal framework structure similar to that of widely investigated Au₂₅(SR)₁₈. In both clusters, a M@Ag₁₂ (M = Pd, Pt) core is capped by six distorted dimeric -RS-Ag-SR-Ag-SR- units. However, the silver-thiolate overlayer gives rise to a geometric chirality at variance to Au₂₅(SR)₁₈. The effect of doping on the electronic structure was studied through measured optical absorption spectra and ab initio analysis. This work demonstrates that modulating electronic structures by transition-metal doping is expected to provide effective means to manipulate electronic, optical, chemical, and catalytic properties of thiolated noble metal nanoclusters.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3ageometry 3ananoparticles 3apalladium 3aplatinum 3astereoisomerism 3avariance1 aSu, Haifeng1 aYang, Huayan1 aMalola, Sami1 aLin, Shuichao1 aHäkkinen, Hannu1 aZheng, Nanfeng0 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2015 Sept. 23, v. 137, no. 37 p.11880-11883dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-51267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fjacs.5b071863Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03592naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100006600147245009200213300001800305520166500323536029201988592002802280650001902308650001402327650001202341650000902353650001502362650001402377650001202391650001502403650001702418650001102435650001202446650001302458650002002471651001802491651001802509653001902527653002002546653001302566653001602579653002802595653002602623653002602649653003302675653002802708653002002736700002302756700002202779700002602801773010802827856008202935852000903017655001203026IND60791206620221119192328.0220826e202210  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079120662DNAL7 a10.1177/095968362211069742doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTelesiński, Maciej M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5765-284914aThe significance of Atlantic Water routing in the Nordic Seas: The Holocene perspective  ap. 1104-1116.  aThe Nordic Seas are a key region for global ocean circulation, crucial in water mass exchange between the North Atlantic and the Arctic oceans, and deepwater formation. The advection of Atlantic Water (AW) to the Nordic Seas is decisive for the oceanography and climate of the region and beyond. Here, we present a set of sedimentary records, including two new cores from the western Nordic Seas to reconstruct the history of AW routing in the Nordic Seas over the Holocene. Our results show that the early Holocene (11.7–8 ka BP) thermal maximum, caused by an ‘overshoot’ of overturning circulation and high insolation, was limited to the eastern Nordic Seas, while the western part remained cold due to the meltwater blocking the spreading of AW. After 8 ka BP, the retreat of the freshwater lid allowed AW to reach the central Greenland Sea, where deep convection developed. After 5 ka BP, the increase in sea-ice export from the Arctic strengthened deep convection, which intensified the westward AW flow. A disruption of convectional activity around 2.7 ka BP, triggered by a minimum in solar activity, caused cooling and expansion of sea ice in the Nordic Seas and might have contributed to a global climatic deterioration. The overturning circulation in the Nordic Seas did not recover to its previous state until the present. We demonstrate that the rate of AW advection into the Nordic Seas alone is not enough to understand the oceanographic evolution of this area and its influence on regional or even global ocean and climate changes. The shifts in AW routing within the Nordic Seas and the rate of deep convection are also important.  aFunding The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This work was supported by the National Science Centre in Poland [grant numbers 2016/21/D/ST10/00785, 2016/21/B/ST10/02308, 2020/39/B/ST10/01698].  aPublisher supplied data 3aHolocene epoch 3aadvection 3aclimate 3acold 3aconvection 3aevolution 3aexports 3afreshwater 3aoceanography 3aoceans 3asea ice 3asnowmelt 3asolar radiation 3aArctic region 3aGreenland Sea 0aAtlantic Water 0aAtlantification 0aHolocene 0aNordic Seas 0aoverturning circulation 0aopen-ocean convection 0aplanktic foraminifera 0aradiocarbon ventilation ages 0aReturn Atlantic Current 0astable isotopes1 aŁącka, Magdalena1 aKujawa, Agnieszka1 aZajączkowski, Marek,0 tHolocene.g2022 Oct., v. 32, no. 10 p.1104-1116dSAGE PublicationswJournal:J000001502x1477-09117nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1177/095968362211069743Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03244naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001500139245014900154300001800303500001900321500002000340520147200360592002801832596003701860596006401897596003501961596003701996596004202033650001902075650002102094650002702115650002602142650002102168650003302189650002102222650002302243650002502266650001502291650000802306650002202314650001402336650001102350700001602361700001602377700001502393700001702408700001902425700006002444773011602504856007302620852000902693655001202702IND60699468220221120092453.0200619e202006  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069946822DNAL7 a10.1111/tpj.147042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSun, Yulin10aCharacterization of an alkylresorcinol synthase that forms phenolics accumulating in the cuticular wax on various organs of rye (Secale cereale)  ap. 1294-1312.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aAlkylresorcinols are bioactive compounds produced in diverse plant species, with chemical structures combining an aliphatic hydrocarbon chain and an aromatic ring with characteristic hydroxyl substituents. Here, we aimed to isolate and characterize the enzyme that forms the alkylresorcinols accumulating in the cuticular wax on the surface of all above‐ground organs of rye. Based on sequence homology with other type‐III polyketide synthases, a candidate alkylresorcinol synthase was cloned. Yeast heterologous expression showed that the enzyme, ScARS, is highly specific for the formation of the aromatic resorcinol ring structure, through aldol condensation analogous to stilbene synthases. The enzyme accepts long‐chain and very‐long‐chain acyl‐CoA starter substrates, preferring saturated over unsaturated chains. It typically carries out three rounds of condensation with malonyl‐CoA prior to cyclization, with only very minor activity for a fourth round of malonyl‐CoA condensation and cyclization to 5‐(2′‐oxo)‐alkylresorcinols or 5‐(2′‐hydroxy)‐alkylresorcinols. Like other enzymes involved in cuticle formation, ScARS is localized to the endoplasmic reticulum. ScARS expression patterns were found correlated with alkylresorcinol accumulation during leaf development and across different rye organs. Overall, our results thus suggest that ScARS synthesizes the cuticular alkylresorcinols found on diverse rye organ surfaces.  aPublisher supplied data  cCanada Foundation for Innovation  cNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada  cCanada Research Chairs Program  cCanada Foundation for Innovation  cChina Scholarship Council Fellowships 3aSecale cereale 3aalkylresorcinols 3acondensation reactions 3aendoplasmic reticulum 3aepicuticular wax 3aheterologous gene expression 3aleaf development 3amalonyl coenzyme A 3apolyketide synthases 3aresorcinol 3arye 3asequence homology 3astilbenes 3ayeasts1 aYao, Ruonan1 aJi, Xiufeng1 aWu, Hongqi1 aLuna, Alvaro1 aWang, Zhonghua1 aJetter, Reinhard1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6302-28350 tplant journal.g2020 June, v. 102, no. 6 p.1294-1312dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl47643x0960-74127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/tpj.147043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03036naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001600144245012700160300001800287520154600305592002801851650000801879650001501887650001501902650001501917650002601932650001501958650001501973650001701988650002802005650002102033650001902054650001102073650001802084650001402102653001502116653003302131653003002164653002602194653002102220700001702241700001202258700001802270700001502288700001402303773012402317856008002441852000902521655001202530IND60564317720221119044420.0170318e20170315xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056431772DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.6b150772doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJin, Yulong10aProbing the Dynamic Interaction between Damaged DNA and a Cellular Responsive Protein Using a Piezoelectric Mass Biosensor  ap. 8490-8497.  aThe binding events between damaged DNA and recognition biomolecules are of great interest for understanding the activity of DNA-damaging drugs and the related DNA repair networks. Herein, a simple and sensitive sensor system was tailored for real-time probing of the dynamic molecular recognition between cisplatin-damaged-DNA (cisPt-DNA) and a cellular responsive protein, high-mobility-group box 1 (HMGB1). By integration of flow injection analysis (FIA) with quartz crystal microbalance (QCM), the interaction time-course of cisPt-DNA and HMGB1 domain A (HMGB1a) was investigated. The highly specific sensing interface was carefully designed and fabricated using cisPt-DNA as recognition element. A hybrid self-assembled monolayer consisting of cysteamine and mercaptohexanol was introduced to resist nonspecific adsorption. The calculated kinetic parameters (kₐₛₛ and kdᵢₛₛ) and the dissociation constant (KD) demonstrated the rapid recognition and tight binding of HMGB1a toward cisPt-DNA. Molecular docking was employed to simulate the complex formed by cisPt-DNA and HMGB1a. The tight binding of such a DNA-damage responsive complex is appealing for the downstream molecular recognition event related to the resistance to DNA repair. This continuous-flow QCM biosensor is an ideal tool for studying specific interactions between drug-damaged-DNAs and their recognition proteins in a physiological-relevant environment, and will provide a potential sensor platform for rapid screening and evaluating metal anticancer drugs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aDNA damage 3aDNA repair 3aadsorption 3aantineoplastic agents 3abiosensors 3acysteamine 3adissociation 3aflow injection analysis 3amolecular models 3anucleoproteins 3aquartz 3arapid methods 3ascreening 0aDNA damage 0apiezoelectric mass biosensor 0ahigh-mobility-group box 1 0amolecular recognition 0akinetic analysis1 aXie, Yunfeng1 aWu, Kui1 aHuang, Yanyan1 aWang, Fuyi1 aZhao, Rui0 tACS Applied Materials & Interfaces.g2017 Mar. 15, v. 9, no. 10 p.8490-8497dAmerican Chemical Societyx1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facsami.6b150773Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03222naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001500151245013900166300001600305520116100321536018101482592002801663596002401691650002801715650002001743650002501763650001701788650001201805650001301817650001401830650002801844650001501872650002001887650002601907650001001933650001601943650001701959650002301976650000901999650002302008650002002031650001502051650002102066650001402087650000902101653002402110653002402134653002802158653002102186653002802207653003102235700001702266700002202283700001802305700002202323700001702345773012702362856008602489852000902575655001202584IND60679273220221119194916.0210310e20190101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067927322DNAL7 a10.1080/17429145.2019.16334282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAli, Amjad10aEndophytic Aureobasidium pullulans BSS6 assisted developments in phytoremediation potentials of Cucumis sativus under Cd and Pb stress  ap. 303-313.  aIn the current study, we aimed to elucidate the bioremediating potential of endophytic fungi during various heavy metals stresses to the cucumber (Cucumis sativus) plants. Preliminary screening showed that endophyte (Aureobasidium. pullulans BSS6) produced IAA and extra-cellular enzymes (phosphatase, cellulase and glucosidase). Therefore, BSS6 was inoculated to cucumber plants during short term (24 h) heavy metals stress (STM) and long-term (7 days) heavy metals stress (LTM). Results showed that antioxidant activities (catalase, peroxidase and reduced glutathione) were significantly enhanced and lipid peroxidation inhibited during stress conditions in A. pullulans BSS6 inoculated plants, particularly in LTM stress. The ameliorative effects of BSS6 were evident from the quantification of results and were found to significantly regulate soil enzymatic activities: including (β -glucosidase, phosphatases and cellulases) during STM and LTM. Hence, endophytic BSS6 proved to be efficient in improving cucumber tolerance during metal contamination via regulating soil enzymatic activities to reduce metal uptake and boost the antioxidant system.  aThis research was supported by Basic Science Research Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) funded by the Ministry of Education (2017R1D1A1B04035601).  aPublisher supplied data  a2017R1D1A1B04035601 3aAureobasidium pullulans 3aCucumis sativus 3aantioxidant activity 3aantioxidants 3acadmium 3acatalase 3acucumbers 3aendo-1,4-beta-glucanase 3aendophytes 3aenzyme activity 3aextracellular enzymes 3afungi 3aglutathione 3aheavy metals 3aindole acetic acid 3alead 3alipid peroxidation 3ametal tolerance 3aperoxidase 3aphytoremediation 3ascreening 3asoil 0aHeavy metals stress 0aantioxidant enzymes 0areactive oxygen species 0aphytoremediation 0asoil enzymes activities 0anear-infrared spectroscopy1 aBilal, Saqib1 aKhan, Abdul Latif1 aMabood, Fazal1 aAl-Harrasi, Ahmed1 aLee, In-Jung0 tJournal of plant interactions.g2019 Jan. 1, v. 14, no. 1 p.303-313dTaylor & FranciswJournal:J000000112x1742-91537nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/17429145.2019.16334283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02715naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245006900164520145900233592002801692650000801720650001501728650002101743650001901764650001101783650002601794650001501820650001001835650001101845650001301856650001101869700001801880700002301898700001701921700001401938700001901952700002101971700002101992700001802013700002302031773012402054856008202178852000902260655001202269IND60794313620221119120958.0220922e20220912xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079431362DNAL7 a10.3390/pathogens110910332doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBerry, Neil 10aMucosal Responses to Zika Virus Infection in Cynomolgus Macaques  aZika virus (ZIKV) cases continue to be reported, and no vaccine or specific antiviral agent has been approved for the prevention or treatment of infection. Though ZIKV is primarily transmitted by mosquitos, cases of sexual transmission and prolonged viral RNA presence in semen have been reported. In this observational study, we report the mucosal responses to sub-cutaneous and mucosal ZIKV exposure in cynomolgus macaques during acute and late chronic infection. Subcutaneous challenge induced a decrease in the growth factor VEGF in colorectal and cervicovaginal tissues 100 days post-challenge, in contrast to the observed increase in these tissues following vaginal infection. This different pattern was not observed in the uterus, where VEGF was upregulated independently of the challenge route. Vaginal challenge induced a pro-inflammatory profile in all mucosal tissues during late chronic infection. Similar responses were already observed during acute infection in a vaginal tissue explant model of ex vivo challenge. Non-productive and productive infection 100 days post-in vivo vaginal challenge induced distinct proteomic profiles which were characterized by further VEGF increase and IL-10 decrease in non-infected animals. Ex vivo challenge of mucosal explants revealed tissue-specific modulation of cytokine levels during the acute phase of infection. Mucosal cytokine profiles could represent biosignatures of persistent ZIKV infection.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRNA 3aZika virus 3aantiviral agents 3ainterleukin-10 3amodels 3aobservational studies 3aproteomics 3asemen 3auterus 3avaccines 3avagina1 aStein, Monja 1 aFerguson, Deborah 1 aHam, Claire 1 aHall, Jo 1 aGiles, Elaine 1 aKempster, Sarah 1 aAdedeji, Yemisi 1 aAlmond, Neil 1 aHerrera, Carolina 0 tPathogens.g2022 Sept. 12, v. 11, no. 9dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27146x2076-08177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/pathogens110910333Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03290naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001700139245007100156300001800227500001900245500002000264520158900284592002801873596005901901596005901960596005902019596005902078596003202137596003402169596002602203596003602229650001702265650001702282650002102299650001502320650001702335650001902352650000902371650002002380650002602400700001802426700001402444700001302458700005802471700005702529773011602586856007302702852000902775655001202784IND60699468320221120082620.0200619e202006  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069946832DNAL7 a10.1111/tpj.146922doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXiao, Yunhua10aGSK2 stabilizes OFP3 to suppress brassinosteroid responses in rice  ap. 1187-1201.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aBrassinosteroids (BRs) are a class of phytohormones that modulate several important agronomic traits in rice (Oryza sativa). GSK2 is one of the critical suppressors of BR signalling and targets transcription factors such as OsBZR1 and DLT to regulate BR responses. Here, we identified OFP3 (OVATE FAMILY PROTEIN 3) as an interactor of both GSK2 and DLT by yeast‐two‐hybrid screening and demonstrated that OFP3 plays a distinctly negative role in BR responses. While knockout of OFP3 promoted rice seedling growth, overexpression of OFP3 led to strong BR insensitivity, which resulted in reduced plant height, leaf angle, and grain size. Interestingly, both BR biosynthetic and signalling genes had decreased expression in the overexpression plants. OFP3 overexpression also enhanced the phenotypes of BR‐deficient mutants, but largely suppressed those of BR‐enhanced plants. Moreover, treatment with either BR or bikinin, a GSK3‐like kinase inhibitor, induced OFP3 depletion, whereas GSK2 or brassinazole, a BR synthesis inhibitor, promoted OFP3 accumulation. Furthermore, OFP3 exhibited transcription repressor activity and was able to interact with itself as well as additional BR‐related components, including OFP1, OSH1, OSH15, OsBZR1, and GF14c. Importantly, GSK2 can phosphorylate OFP3 and enhance these interactions. We propose that OFP3, as a suppressor of both BR synthesis and signalling but stabilized by GSK2, incorporates into a transcription factor complex to facilitate BR signalling control, which is critical for the proper development of various tissues.  aPublisher supplied data  a31722037cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a91335203cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a91435106cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a91735302cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a‐3cIowa State University  cChina Agricultural University  cInstitute of Genetics  cSichuan Agricultural University 3aOryza sativa 3abiosynthesis 3abrassinosteroids 3aleaf angle 3aplant height 3aplant hormones 3arice 3aseedling growth 3atranscription factors1 aZhang, Guoxia1 aLiu, Dapu1 aNiu, Mei1 aTong, Hongning1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8749-53461 aChu, Chengcai1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8097-61150 tplant journal.g2020 June, v. 102, no. 6 p.1187-1201dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl47643x0960-74127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/tpj.146923Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01481naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001400140245016100154300001800315520023800333592002800571650001700599650002700616650002300643650001300666650001700679650001500696650001900711650001800730650001900748650001400767650002400781650002000805700001500825700001200840700001300852773013400865856007500999852000901074655001201083IND60659045720221118201156.0190827e20110823xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065904572DNAL7 a10.1039/c1cc13237g2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDing, Dan10aConjugated oligoelectrolyte-polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxane loaded pH-responsive nanoparticles for targeted fluorescence imaging of cancer cell nucleus  ap. 9837-9839.  aWe report conjugated oligoelectrolyte-polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxane (COE-POSS) loaded and pH-triggered chitosan/poly(ethylene glycol) nanoparticles with folic acid functionalization for targeted imaging of cancer cell nucleus.  aPublisher supplied data 3acell nucleus 3achemical communication 3achemical reactions 3achitosan 3afluorescence 3afolic acid 3aimage analysis 3ananoparticles 3aneoplasm cells 3aneoplasms 3apolyethylene glycol 3asilsesquioxanes1 aPu, Kan-Yi1 aLi, Kai1 aLiu, Bin0 tChemical communications.g2011 Aug. 23, v. 47, no. 35 p.9837-9839dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26910x1364-548X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c1cc13237g3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02862naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001700144245011900161300001800280520148900298592002801787650002101815650001401836650002301850650001501873650001701888650002201905650003101927650001101958650002401969650001801993650001102011650001502022653002002037653003202057653004702089653003202136653002802168700001902196773012402215856008002339852000902419655001202428IND60564317920221119044317.0170318e20170315xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056431792DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.6b152512doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAhn, Eungjin10aMultidimensional Thin Film Hybrid Electrodes with MoS2 Multilayer for Electrocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution Reaction  ap. 8688-8695.  aHybrid electrodes are widely used in various energy storage and conversion devices. However, conventional fabrication methods like simple mixing allow only limited control over the internal electrode structure, and it is often difficult to elucidate the structure–property relationship among the electrode components. Taking advantage of the versatile layer-by-layer (LbL) assembly method, herein we report the preparation of electrocatalytic thin film electrodes for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), highlighting the importance of nanoscale composition in multidimensional hybrid electrodes. The fabrication utilized the electrostatic interaction between the two components: catalytically active two-dimensional MoS₂ nanosheets and conductive, one-dimensional multiwalled carbon nanotube (MWNT) support. The electrocatalytic activity was found to be highly tunable by adjusting the thickness of the electrode, suggesting structural dependence of electron transfer and mass transport between the electrolyte and electrode, which is otherwise difficult to investigate in electrodes fabricated by simple conventional methods. Furthermore, the detailed mechanism of HER on the hybrid electrode was also investigated, revealing the fine balance between the catalytic activity of MoS₂ and conductivity of MWNT. We anticipate that this unique approach will offer new insights into the nanoscale control of electrode architecture and the development of novel electroactive catalysts.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon nanotubes 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3aelectrodes 3aelectrolytes 3aelectron transfer 3aelectrostatic interactions 3aenergy 3ahydrogen production 3amass transfer 3amixing 3ananosheets 0aelectrocatalyst 0ahydrogen evolution reaction 0achemically exfoliated molybdenum disulfide 0amultiwalled carbon nanotube 0alayer-by-layer assembly1 aKim, Byeong-Su0 tACS Applied Materials & Interfaces.g2017 Mar. 15, v. 9, no. 10 p.8688-8695dAmerican Chemical Societyx1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facsami.6b152513Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03433naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094024002200125024001900147040001800166100002900184245011500213300001600328520217200344592002802516653002402544653001402568653001302582653001002595700002302605700002202628700002502650700001702675700001702692700001702709700001902726700002802745700001502773773013502788856007702923961001403000852000903014655001203023IND60580676220221118043400.0171214e20171201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058067622DNAL7 a10.1089/fpd.2017.23242doi7 aPMC63170732pmcid7 a289263002pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRichardson, LaTonia Clay13aAn Updated Scheme for Categorizing Foods Implicated in Foodborne Disease Outbreaks: A Tri-Agency Collaboration  ap. 701-710.  aBackground: Foodborne disease data collected during outbreak investigations are used to estimate the percentage of foodborne illnesses attributable to specific food categories. Current food categories do not reflect whether or how the food has been processed and exclude many multiple-ingredient foods.Materials and Methods: Representatives from three federal agencies worked collaboratively in the Interagency Food Safety Analytics Collaboration (IFSAC) to develop a hierarchical scheme for categorizing foods implicated in outbreaks, which accounts for the type of processing and provides more specific food categories for regulatory purposes. IFSAC also developed standard assumptions for assigning foods to specific food categories, including some multiple-ingredient foods. The number and percentage of outbreaks assignable to each level of the hierarchy were summarized.Results: The IFSAC scheme is a five-level hierarchy for categorizing implicated foods with increasingly specific subcategories at each level, resulting in a total of 234 food categories. Subcategories allow distinguishing features of implicated foods to be reported, such as pasteurized versus unpasteurized fluid milk, shell eggs versus liquid egg products, ready-to-eat versus raw meats, and five different varieties of fruit categories. Twenty-four aggregate food categories contained a sufficient number of outbreaks for source attribution analyses. Among 9791 outbreaks reported from 1998 to 2014 with an identified food vehicle, 4607 (47%) were assignable to food categories using this scheme. Among these, 4218 (92%) were assigned to one of the 24 aggregate food categories, and 840 (18%) were assigned to the most specific category possible.Conclusions: Updates to the food categorization scheme and new methods for assigning implicated foods to specific food categories can help increase the number of outbreaks attributed to a single food category. The increased specificity of food categories in this scheme may help improve source attribution analyses, eventually leading to improved foodborne illness source attribution estimates and enhanced food safety and regulatory efforts.  aPublisher supplied data 0afood categorization 0afoodborne 0aoutbreak 0aIFSAC1 aBazaco, Michael C.1 aParker, Cary Chen1 aDewey-Mattia, Daniel1 aGolden, Neal1 aJones, Karen1 aKlontz, Karl1 aTravis, Curtis1 aKufel, Joanna Zablotsky1 aCole, Dana0 tFoodborne pathogens & disease.g2017 Dec. 01, v. 14, no. 12 p.701-710dMary Ann Liebert, Inc.wJournal:jnl3973649x1556-71257nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1089/fpd.2017.23243Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/FSIS  aDNAL 7aarticle01257naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002500140245014700165300001800312520030900330592002800639650001300667650001200680650001100692650001400703650001400717700001900731773013400750856007400884852000900958655001200967IND60660242420221120075256.0190823e20140626xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066024242DNAL7 a10.1039/c4cc03404j2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCipressi, Jacqueline10aOctahedral to trigonal prismatic distortion driven by subjacent orbital π antibonding interactions and modulated by ligand redox noninnocence  ap. 7956-7959.  aRu(ONO)₂ and Os(ONO)₂ distort from octahedral towards trigonal prismatic geometry in order to relieve π antibonding due to donation from the second-highest ligand orbital to the metal.

Every year during the breeding season, there is variable mortality among chicks from the largest Olrog's gull (Larus atlanticus) colony in Argentina. During two consecutive breeding seasons of Olrog's gull, we studied epidemiological and pathological aspects of infections by digeneans (Microphallidae) and nematodes (Acuariidae) in Olrog's gull chicks. Prevalence of nematode infection was 80.3% in 2005 and 89.2% in 2006, and mean intensity was 23.7 in 2005 and 50.8 in 2006. The risk for infection rose 34.3% and the intensity of infection 6.7% for every increase of 1 mm in head–beak length. The nematodes occupied the proventricular glands and caused disruption of their structure and mild inflammatory proventriculitis. Prevalence of digenean infection was 97.0% in 2005 and 97.3% in 2006. In 10-day-old live chicks, prevalence was 98.0% in 2006 and 95.3% in 2007. Infection was associated with severe catarrhal enteritis, lymphocyte/eosinophil-rich inflammatory responses, extensive fibroblast proliferation around the parasites, and disruption of the architecture of the adjacent crypts.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAcuariidae 3arisk 3anematode infections 3ainflammation 3aLarus 3aenteritis 3aMicrophallidae 3afibroblasts 3aproventriculitis 3achicks 3amortality 3abreeding season 3ahelminths 3aArgentina 0aLarus atlanticus 0aOlrog's gull 0ahelminth infections 0abirds1 aSmits, Judit E.1 aMartorelli, Sergio R.0 tAvian diseases.g2012 Dec., v. 56, no. 4 p.764-767dAmerican Association of Avian Pathologistsx1938-43517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1637%2F10251-052112-Case.13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02334naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094024002200131024001900153040001800172100002500190245007200215300001600287500001500303506007600318520099000394592002801384506003701412650001501449650001201464650001401476650002201490650000901512650001101521650001501532650001501547650001201562650002301574653001001597653001101607653001101618653001601629653001701645700001901662773009101681856008301772852000901855655001201864IND60559584020221207125956.0161216e20151215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055958402DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ydbio.2015.02.0032doi7 aPMC46842272pmcid7 a257045112pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHardwick, Laura J.A.13aAn oncologist׳s friend: How Xenopus contributes to cancer research  ap. 180-187.  a2019-12-06  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aOne of the most striking features of the Xenopus system is the versatility in providing a unique range of both in vitro and in vivo models that are rapid, accessible and easily manipulated. Here we present an overview of the diverse contribution that Xenopus has made to advance our understanding of tumour biology and behaviour; a contribution that goes beyond the traditional view of Xenopus as a developmental model organism. From the utility of the egg and oocyte extract system to the use of whole embryos as developmental or induced tumour models, the Xenopus system has been fundamental to investigation of cell cycle mechanisms, cell metabolism, cell signalling and cell behaviour, and has allowed an increasing appreciation of the parallels between early development and the pathogenesis of tumour progression and metastasis. Although not the prototypical oncological model system, we propose that Xenopus is an adaptable and multifunctional tool in the oncologist׳s arsenal.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3ametabolism 3aXenopus 3aneoplasms 3aearly development 3aeggs 3amodels 3ametastasis 3acell cycle 3aoocytes 3acell communication 0aModel 0aTumour 0aCancer 0aOncogenesis 0apathogenesis1 aPhilpott, Anna0 tDevelopmental biology.g2015 Dec. 15, v. 408 p.180-187dElsevier Inc.x0012-16067nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ydbio.2015.02.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02587naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002400145245006600169300001800235520125600253592002801509650004401537650001701581650002601598650001401624650001101638650001001649650001201659650001301671650002301684650001301707650001501720650001801735650001501753650001201768650001601780650003701796700002201833700007101855773013901926856007902065852000902144655001202153IND60600826420221120130228.0180704e20180118xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060082642DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.est.7b060112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAregahegn, Kifle Z.10aPhotochemistry of Solid Films of the Neonicotinoid Nitenpyram  ap. 2760-2767.  aThe environmental fates of nitenpyram (NPM), a widely used neonicotinoid insecticide, are not well-known. A thin solid film of NPM deposited on a germanium attenuated total reflectance (ATR) crystal was exposed to radiation from a low-pressure mercury lamp at 254 nm, or from broadband low pressure mercury photolysis lamps centered at 350 or 313 nm. The loss during photolysis was followed in time using FTIR. The photolysis quantum yields (ϕ), defined as the number of NPM molecules lost per photon absorbed, were determined to be (9.4 ± 1.5) × 10–⁴ at 350 nm, (1.0 ± 0.3) × 10–³ at 313 nm, and (1.2 ± 0.4) × 10–² at 254 nm (±2σ). Imines, one with a carbonyl group, were detected as surface-bound products and gaseous N₂O was generated in low (11%) yield. The UV–vis absorption spectra of NPM in water was different from that in acetonitrile, dichloromethane, and methanol, or in a thin solid film. The photolytic lifetime of solid NPM at a solar zenith angle at 35° is calculated to be 36 min, while that for NPM in water is 269 min, assuming that the quantum yield is the same as in the solid. Thus, there may be a significant sensitivity to the medium for photolytic degradation and the lifetime of NPM in the environment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aacetonitrile 3aenvironmental science 3agermanium 3aimines 3alamps 3amercury 3amethanol 3amethylene chloride 3amoieties 3anitenpyram 3anitrous oxide 3aphotolysis 3aphotons 3areflectance 3aultraviolet-visible spectroscopy1 aEzell, Michael J.1 aFinlayson-Pitts, Barbara J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4650-168X0 tEnvironmental science & technology.g2018 Jan. 18, v. 52, no. 5 p.2760-2767dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23339x1520-58517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.est.7b060113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02282naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002400148245015200172300001700324520092000341592002801261596005801289650001701347650002501364650001701389650002101406650001001427650002001437650002401457650001201481650001801493650001601511650001501527650002001542650001601562700005401578700001501632773013301647856008301780852000901863655001201872IND60731629420221119043854.0220528e202104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073162942DNAL7 a10.1007/s11694-020-00701-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBarani, Yoon Hlaine10aEffect of thermal and ultrasonic pretreatment on enzyme inactivation, color, phenolics and flavonoids contents of infrared freeze-dried rose flower  ap. 995-1004.  aThe effects of ultrasound and thermal pretreatment prior to freeze drying combined with infrared on enzyme activity, color changes and antioxidant activities of dried rose flowers were studied.

Ultrasonic pretreatment could improve the color of dried rose flowers. In addition, low-frequency ultrasound pretreatment could significantly improve the content of anthocyanins content and reduce the degradation rate. The antioxidant activity of low-frequency ultrasound pretreatment rose was also higher than that of dried rose flowers by thermal and high-frequency ultrasound pretreatment.

Despite extensive experimentation on this gene in multiple species, including humans, we still do not understand the earliest effects on development mediated by this gene. This prompted us to develop pax6 mutant lines in Xenopus tropicalis taking advantage of the utility of the Xenopus system for examining early development and in addition to establish a model for studying the human disease aniridia in an accessible lower vertebrate. We have generated mutants in pax6 by using Transcription Activator-Like Effector Nuclease (TALEN) constructs for gene editing in X. tropicalis. Embryos with putative null mutations show severe eye abnormalities and changes in brain development, as assessed by changes in morphology and gene expression. One gene that we found is downregulated very early in development in these pax6 mutants is myc, a gene involved in pluripotency and progenitor cell maintenance and likely a mediator of some key pax6 functions in the embryo. Changes in gene expression in the developing brain and pancreas reflect other important functions of pax6 during development. In mutations with partial loss of pax6 function eye development is initially relatively normal but froglets show an underdeveloped iris, similar to the classic phenotype (aniridia) seen in human patients with PAX6 mutations. Other eye abnormalities observed in these froglets, including cataracts and corneal defects, are also common in human aniridia. The frog model thus allows us to examine the earliest deficits in eye formation as a result of pax6 lesions, and provides a useful model for understanding the developmental basis for the aniridia phenotype seen in humans.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aXenopus tropicalis 3abrain 3acataract 3acornea 3aearly development 3afrogs 3agene expression 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3ahuman diseases 3ahumans 3ainvertebrates 3aloss-of-function mutation 3amodels 3amutants 3apancreas 3apatients 3aphenotype 3astem cells 0aXenopus tropicalis 0aTranscription Activator-Like Effector Nuclease (TALEN) 0aLens 0aRetina 0aNeural patterning1 aFisher, Marilyn1 aNakajima, Keisuke1 aOdeleye, Akinleye O.1 aZimmerman, Keith B.1 aFish, Margaret B.1 aYaoita, Yoshio1 aChojnowski, Jena L.1 aLauderdale, James D.1 aNetland, Peter A.1 aGrainger, Robert M.0 tDevelopmental biology.g2015 Dec. 15, v. 408 p.328-344dElsevier Inc.x0012-16067nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ydbio.2015.02.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02023naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002400139245007000163300001600233500001100249520105800260592002801318650002001346650001401366650001401380650001501394650001101409650001401420650002601434650002401460650002201484773009701506856007301603852000901676655001201685IND60523297420221121122605.0160610e201607  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052329742DNAL7 a10.1111/ele.126142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHadfield, Jarrod D.14aThe spatial scale of local adaptation in a stochastic environment  ap. 780-788.  aLETTER  aThe distribution of phenotypes in space will be a compromise between adaptive plasticity and local adaptation increasing the fit of phenotypes to local conditions and gene flow reducing that fit. Theoretical models on the evolution of quantitative characters on spatially explicit landscapes have only considered scenarios where optimum trait values change as deterministic functions of space. Here, these models are extended to include stochastic spatially autocorrelated aspects to the environment, and consequently the optimal phenotype. Under these conditions, the regression of phenotype on the environmental variable becomes steeper as the spatial scale on which populations are sampled becomes larger. Under certain deterministic models – such as linear clines – the regression is constant. The way in which the regression changes with spatial scale is informative about the degree of phenotypic plasticity, the relative scale of effective gene flow and the environmental dependency of selection. Connections to temporal models are discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aautocorrelation 3aevolution 3agene flow 3alandscapes 3amodels 3aphenotype 3aphenotypic plasticity 3aquantitative traits 3aspatial variation0 tEcology letters.g2016 July, v. 19, no. 7 p.780-788dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltdx1461-023X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ele.126143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02005naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002100150245010700171300001600278520085800294592002801152650001601180650001701196650001001213650001101223650002501234650002701259650001001286650001001296650001201306650001001318650001001328700002101338700002501359700001601384773009101400856008401491990002301575852000901598655001201607IND60083800220221120032937.0141101e201112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008380022DNAL7 a10.1016/j.acthis.2010.08.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSimons, Peter J.10aApical CD36 immunolocalization in human and porcine taste buds from circumvallate and foliate papillae  ap. 839-843.  aCD36 is the receptor for long chain fatty acids (LCFA), and is expressed in lingual taste cells from rodents. In these animals, CD36 has been proposed to play an important role in oral detection of LCFA, and subsequently, determines their dietary fat preference. Humans also seem to detect LCFA in the oral cavity, however, information on the molecular mechanism of this human orosensory LCFA recognition is currently lacking. The aim of our study was to investigate whether CD36 is also expressed in lingual human and porcine taste buds cells. Using fluorescence immunohistochemistry, apical CD36 expression was revealed in human and porcine taste bud cells from circumvallate and foliate papillae. These data suggest CD36 as the putative orosensory receptor for dietary LCFA in human, and, therefore, may be involved in our preference for fatty foods.  aPublisher supplied data 3adietary fat 3afluorescence 3afoods 3ahumans 3aimmunohistochemistry 3along chain fatty acids 3amouth 3apalps 3arodents 3aswine 3ataste1 aKummer, J.

This study examined metabolic outcomes associated with intake of two diets differing in carbohydrate:protein ratios representing the upper and lower ends of the AMDR. METHODS: Adult, male rats were fed either a high carbohydrate (CHO) diet (60% of energy from carbohydrates, 12% protein, 28% fat; n = 30) or a high protein (PRO) diet (35% carbohydrate, 35% protein, 30% fat; n = 30). Rats were meal-fed 3x/d the respective diets for 10 d and then terminated after overnight food deprivation or 30, 60, 90, 120 min post-prandial (PP). Plasma was collected at each of these points to provide a time course for glucose, insulin and C-peptide. Skeletal muscle and adipose tissues were collected at 0, 30 and 90 min for measurements of basal, early and delayed activation of Akt, p70S6K and Erk 1/2. Data were analyzed by two-way ANOVA. RESULTS: The CHO group produced a consistently elevated response in plasma glucose, insulin and C-peptide following the meal through the 120 min time course. In addition, Akt and Erk 1/2 activation in adipose was much higher than in skeletal muscle. Conversely, the PRO group PP glucose response was minimal and insulin maintained a response similar to a biphasic pattern. Tissue responses for the PRO group were greater for Akt and p70S6K signaling in skeletal muscle compared with adipose. CONCLUSION: Taken together these data suggest that altering CHO:PRO ratios within the AMDR produce different glycemic response patterns accompanied by differential metabolic signaling in skeletal muscle and adipose.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDietary Reference Intakes 3aadults 3aanalysis of variance 3ablood glucose 3ac-peptide 3adietary protein 3aenergy 3afood deprivation 3aglucose 3alipids 3ametabolic studies 3aproteins 3arats 3askeletal muscle1 aLayman, Donald K0 tNutrition & metabolism.g2011 Dec., v. 8, no. 1 p.313-313dSpringer-Verlagx1743-70757nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1743-7075-8-13  aDNAL 7aarticle03146naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245017300163300001600336520163200352592002801984650001902012650001902031650002002050650002202070650001002092650004302102650001402145650001302159650004402172650000702216650001302223650001602236650001102252650001602263653000902279653004402288653003002332653002702362653002102389653002202410700006202432773009202494856008102586852000902667655001202676IND60085878620221118092935.0160901e20131204xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008587862DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aca.2013.09.0592doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGatti, Rita10aHigh performance liquid chromatography analysis of aliphatic thiols in alimentary supplements and pharmaceuticals using menadione as a new useful derivatization reagent  ap. 273-279.  aThe use of menadione (MD) as a pre-column reagent for high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis of aliphatic thiols is proposed. The reaction was carried out for 5min at room temperature and pH 8.5. The developed method was applied to the N-acetylcysteine (NAC) analysis of alimentary supplements and pharmaceutical formulations. The effect of the complex matrix was evaluated by the study of the thiol derivatization reaction both in standard and in placebo solutions. The yield of NAC-MD adduct was found to be quantitative at a reagent to thiol molar ratio of about 4 in comparison with an authentic specimen of synthesized NAC adduct, which was characterized by 1H NMR, IR and UV. The routine chromatographic separations were performed on a Synergi MAX-RP column using a mobile phase consisting of methanol/triethylammonium (TEA) phosphate buffer (pH 3; 0.05molL−1) 70:30 (v/v) at a flow-rate of 0.4mLmin−1. UV-diode array detection was used setting the wavelength at λ=260nm. The validation parameters such as linearity, sensitivity, accuracy, precision, selectivity and ruggedness were found to be highly satisfactory. Similar linear responses were observed by standard and placebo solutions (determination coefficient: 0.9996). Limit of detection was about 0.019μgg−1. Intra-day precision (relative standard deviation, R.S.D.) was ≤0.81% for NAC to internal standard (IS) peak area ratio, ≤0.28% and ≤0.32%, respectively, for NAC and IS retention times (tR), without significant differences between intra- and inter-day data. NAC recovery studies gave good results (100.12%) with R.S.D.=1.05%.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetylcysteine 3aderivatization 3adetection limit 3adrug formulations 3adrugs 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3amenadione 3amethanol 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3apH 3aplacebos 3atemperature 3athiols 3awavelengths 0aHPLC 0aMenadione (2-methyl-1,4-naphthoquinone) 0aPre-column derivatization 0aAlimentary supplements 0aN-acetylcysteine 0aMethod validation1 aVitellaro, Valeria1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7280-48580 tAnalytica chimica acta.g2013 Dec. 04, v. 804 p.273-279dElsevier B.V.x0003-26707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aca.2013.09.0593Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02577naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245006100169300001600230520120200246592002801448650001301476650001401489650000901503650001201512650001301524650001901537650001301556650001801569650001701587650001201604653001301616653001101629653000901640653000801649653000901657653001101666653000801677653001701685653000801702653001701710653002401727653001801751653000801769653000801777653001301785700002301798700001601821773010701837856008201944852000902026655001202035IND60645635820221117223151.0190705e20190925xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064563582DNAL7 a10.1016/j.nbt.2019.05.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAnnaratone, Laura10aTissues under-vacuum to overcome suboptimal preservation  ap. 104-109.  aThe accuracy of histopathological diagnosis is strictly reliant on adequate tissue preservation, which is completely dependent on pre-analytical variables. Among these variables, the time interval between the end of surgical excision to the onset of fixation (the cold ischemia time) may adversely affect preservation of tissue morphology, influencing the interpretation and reproducibility of diagnosis. During this time interval, the activation of enzymes may produce autolysis and degradation of antigens and nucleic acids, thus potentially affecting immunocytochemical and molecular results. Several studies have described under-vacuum at 4 °C storage of fresh surgical specimens as a safe and reliable method to control cold ischemia and preserve fresh tissues, as well as to standardize fixation times and implement tissue-banking. This review article gives a systematic overview of the advantages and drawbacks of the use of under-vacuum tissue preservation and cooling in surgical pathology, highlighting the impact this procedure may have on diagnostic and experimental pathology. It also documents our experience acquired within daily practice and national and international projects.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantigens 3aautolysis 3acold 3aenzymes 3aexcision 3ahistopathology 3aischemia 3anucleic acids 3atissue banks 3atissues 0aASCO/CAP 0aCEN/TS 0aFFPE 0aHTA 0aIARC 0aISO/IS 0aRIN 0aSELDI-TOF/MS 0aTQI 0aUnder-vacuum 0aTissue preservation 0aPre-Analytics 0aDNA 0aRNA 0aProteins1 aMarchiò, Caterina1 aSapino, A.,0 tNew biotechnology.g2019 Sept. 25, v. 52 p.104-109dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4392691x1871-67847nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.nbt.2019.05.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02742naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002700147245016800174300001600342520117000358592002801528650001301556650001501569650002001584650001401604650004101618650002301659650001801682650001901700650001101719650001801730650003701748650003201785650002001817650001601837650002201853653003701875653003701912653001701949653003201966653004301998700001802041700001902059773009202078856008102170852000902251655001202260IND60085878720221118092946.0160901e20131204xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008587872DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aca.2013.10.0222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAbolghasemi, Mir Mahdi10aPeriodic mesoporous organosilica with ionic liquid framework as a novel fiber coating for headspace solid-phase microextraction of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons  ap. 280-286.  aPeriodic mesoporous organosilica based on alkylimidazolium ionic liquid (PMO-IL) was prepared and used as a highly porous fiber coating material for solid-phase microextraction (SPME). The prepared nanomaterial was immobilized onto a stainless steel wire for fabrication of the SPME fiber. The fiber was evaluated for the extraction of some polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) from aqueous sample solutions in combination with gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC–MS). A one at-the-time optimization strategy was applied for optimizing the important extraction parameters such as extraction temperature, extraction time, ionic strength, stirring rate, and desorption temperature and time. In optimum conditions, the repeatability for one fiber (n=3), expressed as relative standard deviation (R.S.D.%), was between 4.3% and 9.7% for the test compounds. The detection limits for the studied compounds were between 4 and 9pgmL−1.

Consequently, short-term household load forecast plays an important role in managing distributed energy generation, local consumption, and grid-building integration. Forecasting household load, however, can be an intractable problem. These loads are characterized by large uncertainty and variations, leaving much room to improve accuracy. To improve the household load forecast accuracy, this paper advocates a Kalman filter-based bottom-up approach. First, using a deep learning model and a persistence model on public datasets, the authors verified the advantage of the bottom-up approach through granularity analysis at the appliance, room, house levels. Employing the Symmetric Mean Absolute Percentage Error, the authors compared two strategies: (1) the conventional strategy, which forecasts the load directly at the household level, and (2) the bottom-up strategy, which aggregates the forecasts made at the room or appliance level. Experimental results on public datasets demonstrated that the bottom-up approach holds great promise. Second, as the bottom-up approach is often criticized for the cost, the authors designed a recontextualized Kalman filter model to efficiently forecast appliance energy usages. Using two strategies, the authors compared the Kalman filter-based bottom-up approach with deep-learning models. They found the bottom-up approach reduced forecast errors 49% more than the deep-learning models and 47% more than the conventional strategy. Finally, the authors concluded that a Kalman filter-based bottom-up approach could efficiently improve household load forecast accuracy. The findings could help give fast and accurate load forecasts for building energy management and predictive controls.  aPublisher supplied data 3abuildings 3adata collection 3aenergy 3amodels 3arenewable energy sources 3asolar collectors 3auncertainty 0aHousehold load forecast 0aBottom-up approach 0aForecast granularity 0aAppliance usage forecast 0aKalman filter model1 aChen, Hainan1 aLuo, Xiaowei1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9360-73080 tApplied energy.g2019 Sept. 15, v. 250 p.882-894dElsevier LtdwJournal:11876x0306-26197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2019.05.1023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03326naa a2200673 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100006300153245009300216300001600309520135500325592002801680650003001708650001901738650002501757650002101782650001501803650001901818650003201837650003001869650002301899650002201922650001101944650001301955650002001968650001501988650001602003650001102019650001802030650001602048650002302064650001502087650001802102650001902120651001002139653001302149653001502162653001402177653001202191653001902203653002802222653001302250700002002263700002202283700002802305700001802333700001602351700002102367700001802388700001602406700002002422773010202442856008702544852000902631655001202640IND60582996020221120125441.0171008e20160101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058299602DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2015.09.0292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBalderacchi, Matteo1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4760-976710aAvoiding social traps in the ecosystem stewardship: The Italian Fontanile lowland spring  ap. 526-535.  aFontanile is a Po Valley (Italy) quasi-natural lowland spring built in the middle age. This paper identifies options for the conservation of the Fontanile water dependent ecosystem, using scenarios and simulations, and exploring different policy options. Three modeling analysis have been performed: the first was carried out for estimating groundwater contamination and recharge from above, the second for evaluating the function of vegetative filter strip on the surface water quality and the last one for testing pesticide drift reduction due to the vegetative filter strip. Uncertainty characterization included climate change projections. Despite the nitrate concentration in water could favorite the eutrophication phenomena, this not occurs because of the low phosphate concentration in water and of the presence of arboreal shade. Therefore, the protection strategies must focus on sustaining desirable water quantity conditions. Water saving and conservation technologies that improve the agricultural productivity but reduce the Fontanile water flow and large buffer strips that have a limited efficacy due to the Fontanile hydrological settings can be judged as ecological traps. Inefficient irrigation systems, good agricultural practices, integrated pest management and arboreal filter strip can preserve the quality of those ecosystems.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural productivity 3aclimate change 3aconservation buffers 3aecological traps 3aecosystems 3aeutrophication 3agood agricultural practices 3agroundwater contamination 3airrigation systems 3aissues and policy 3amodels 3anitrates 3apest management 3aphosphates 3aspray drift 3aspring 3asurface water 3auncertainty 3awater conservation 3awater flow 3awater quality 3awater quantity 3aItaly 0aLeaching 0aIrrigation 0aPesticide 0aNitrate 0aClimate change 0aVegetative filter strip 0aModeling1 aPerego, Alessia1 aLazzari, Giovanni1 aMuñoz Carpena, Rafael,1 aAcutis, Marco1 aLaini, Alex1 aGiussani, Andrea1 aSanna, Mattia1 aKane, David1 aTrevisan, Marco0 tScience of the total environment.g2016 Jan. 01, v. 539 p.526-535dElsevier B.V.x0048-96977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2015.09.0293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03752naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094024002200126024001900148040001800167100001700185245011200202300001100314500001100325506007600336520231100412592002802723506003702751650001002788650001702798650001602815650001402831650001802845650001702863650002302880650001202903650001202915650002602927650002202953650002002975650002202995650001003017700002203027773015803049856007803207852000903285655001203294IND60515726020221207093822.0160319e201012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051572602DNAL7 a10.1186/1479-5868-7-402doi7 aPMC28853122pmcid7 a204597842pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJanssen, Ian10aSystematic review of the health benefits of physical activity and fitness in school-aged children and youth  ap. 40.  aReview  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: The purpose was to: 1) perform a systematic review of studies examining the relation between physical activity, fitness, and health in school-aged children and youth, and 2) make recommendations based on the findings. METHODS: The systematic review was limited to 7 health indicators: high blood cholesterol, high blood pressure, the metabolic syndrome, obesity, low bone density, depression, and injuries. Literature searches were conducted using predefined keywords in 6 key databases. A total of 11,088 potential papers were identified. The abstracts and full-text articles of potentially relevant papers were screened to determine eligibility. Data was abstracted for 113 outcomes from the 86 eligible papers. The evidence was graded for each health outcome using established criteria based on the quantity and quality of studies and strength of effect. The volume, intensity, and type of physical activity were considered. RESULTS: Physical activity was associated with numerous health benefits. The dose-response relations observed in observational studies indicate that the more physical activity, the greater the health benefit. Results from experimental studies indicate that even modest amounts of physical activity can have health benefits in high-risk youngsters (e.g., obese). To achieve substantive health benefits, the physical activity should be of at least a moderate intensity. Vigorous intensity activities may provide even greater benefit. Aerobic-based activities had the greatest health benefit, other than for bone health, in which case high-impact weight bearing activities were required. CONCLUSION: The following recommendations were made: 1) Children and youth 5-17 years of age should accumulate an average of at least 60 minutes per day and up to several hours of at least moderate intensity physical activity.

Firstly, the capability of the SVM to predict annual electricity consumption was investigated at both a farm and catchment-level (combined consumption). Electricity consumption data were attained from 16 pasture-based, Irish dairy farms between June 2016 and May 2017 in conjunction with farm data related to herd size, milk production, infrastructural equipment and managerial tendencies, required to generate predictions using the SVM. The SVM predicted annual electricity consumption of dairy farms to within 10.4% (relative prediction error). Concurrently, catchment-level electricity consumption was predicted with an error value less than 5.0%. Secondly, an investigation was carried out to assess the impact of increasing herd size and milk production on dairy farm related electricity consumption at a catchment-level across ten hypothetical infrastructural scenarios. The dairy expansion analysis showed electricity economies of scale across all ten infrastructural scenarios. The greatest reduction in electricity consumption per litre was observed when all farms employed ground water for pre-cooling milk with two additional parlour units, reducing by 4% in 2018, relative to a base scenario (no change to infrastructural equipment). The results presented in this article demonstrate the potential effectiveness of the SVM as a macro-level simulation forecast tool for dairy farm electricity consumption that may be used to quantify the impact of milk production on electricity resources, or to offer decision support to dairy farmers.  aPublisher supplied data 3adairy farming 3aeconomies of scale 3aelectric energy consumption 3aelectricity 3aequipment 3afarmers 3afarms 3agroundwater 3aherd size 3amilk 3amilk production 3aprediction 3asupport vector machines 3aIreland 0aEnergy 0aMilk production 0aMachine-learning 0aDairy expansion 0aSustainability 0aSVM1 aScully, T.1 aUpton, J.1 aMurphy, M.D.0 tApplied energy.g2019 Sept. 15, v. 250 p.1110-1119dElsevier LtdwJournal:11876x0306-26197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2019.05.1033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03204naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094024002200126024001900148040001800167100002100185245009200206300001100298506007600309520182300385592002802208506003702236650001402273650001602287650001202303650001302315650001202328650001502340650001802355650002002373650001702393650002202410650001002432651001102442700002002453700002302473700001702496773015802513856007802671852000902749655001202758IND60515726220221207093825.0160319e201012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051572622DNAL7 a10.1186/1479-5868-7-422doi7 aPMC32249082pmcid7 a204597862pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTremblay, Mark S10aProcess description and evaluation of Canadian Physical Activity Guidelines development  ap. 42.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: This paper describes the process used to arrive at recommended physical activity guidelines for Canadian school-aged children and youth (5-17 years), adults (18-64 years) and older adults (≥65 years). METHODS: The Canadian Society for Exercise Physiology (CSEP) Physical Activity Measurement and Guidelines (PAMG) Steering Committee used the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research Evaluation (AGREE II) Instrument to inform the guideline development process. Fourteen background papers and five systematic reviews were completed. Systematic review authors appraised and synthesized the data, and proposed specific recommendations at an international consensus conference of invited experts and key stakeholders. Independently, an international panel of experts interpreted the evidence from the systematic reviews and developed recommendations following attendance at the Consensus Conference. RESULTS: Using the AGREE II instrument as a guide, specific foci for each of the guidelines were defined and systematic review methodology was used to synthesize the evidence base. The expert panel, CSEP PAMG Steering Committee and methodological consultants reviewed the systematic reviews and Consensus Statement. The expert panel achieved consensus on the level of evidence informing the physical activity guidelines and developed a separate document outlining key recommendations, interpretation of the evidence and justification of each recommendation. CONCLUSION: The CSEP and Public Health Agency of Canada followed a rigorous process to examine the evidence informing potential revisions to existing physical activity guidelines for Canadians. It is believed that this is the first physical activity guideline development process in the world to be guided and assessed by AGREE II and AMSTAR instruments.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aCanadians 3aconsultants 3aelderly 3aexercise 3aexperts 3aguidelines 3apublic health 3aschool children 3astakeholders 3asystematic review 3ayouth 3aCanada1 aKho, Michelle E1 aTricco, Andrea C.,1 aDuggan, Mary0 tinternational journal of behavioral nutrition and physical activity.g2010 Dec., v. 7, no. 1 p.42-42dBioMed CentralwJournal:jnl4350546x1479-58687nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1479-5868-7-423Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02705naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002200140245013700162300002000299500001900319520161400338592002801952650002401980650001402004650001302018650001902031650001302050650001702063700002002080700002302100700001702123773014402140856007402284852000902358655001202367IND60714807220221121231033.0201024e20201013xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071480722DNAL7 a10.1039/d0ta07600g2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 ade Kort, Laura M.14aThe effect of nanoscaffold porosity and surface chemistry on the Li-ion conductivity of LiBH₄–LiNH₂/metal oxide nanocomposites  ap. 20687-20697.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aSolid-state electrolytes are crucial for the realization of safer batteries with improved capacity. Lithium-based complex hydrides, for instance LiBH₄, display promising characteristics as solid-state electrolytes. However, increasing their low room temperature conductivity (10⁻⁸ S cm⁻¹ for LiBH₄) is a prerequisite for application. Partial ionic substitution of BH₄⁻ with NH₂⁻ followed by nanoconfinement in mesoporous oxide scaffolds increases the conductivity to 5 × 10⁻⁴ S cm⁻¹. Here, we show that the conductivity of LiBH₄–LiNH₂/metal oxide nanocomposites is strongly influenced by the chemical and physical nature of the scaffold material. By tuning both the surface chemistry and the pore structure, the conductivity can be varied by three orders of magnitude at room temperature. Unexpectedly, even though a significant influence of the scaffold surface chemistry is observed, the nanocomposite conductivity is largely dictated by the scaffold pore volume. This is in contrast to nanoconfined pure LiBH₄, where the conductivity is governed by the chemical nature of the mesoporous scaffold. For nanoconfined LiBH₄–LiNH₂, the conductivity improvement is attributed to stabilization of a highly conductive phase inside the scaffold pores, rather than the formation of a conductive interfacial layer at the oxide/hydride interface as observed for nanoconfined LiBH₄. These findings could be applicable to other cation- and anion-substituted nanocomposites and provide a useful tool to develop novel solid-state electrolytes with excellent ionic conductivities.  aPublisher supplied data 3aambient temperature 3achemistry 3ahydrides 3ananocomposites 3aporosity 3aporous media1 aHarmel, Justine1 ade Jongh, Petra E.1 aNgene, Peter0 tJournal of materials chemistry A.g2020 Oct. 13, v. 8, no. 39 p.20687-20697dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26903x2050-74967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d0ta07600g3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02491naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001400151245011300165300001400278520101200292592002801304650003401332650002501366650002501391650001901416650002101435650001401456650001201470650002401482650002201506650002401528650002101552650002001573653003301593653001901626653001701645653002101662653002501683700001501708700001801723700002301741700001501764700001501779773012001794856008601914852000902000655001202009IND60525344920221123043758.0190318e20160710xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052534492DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbpol.2016.03.0202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Ying10aPurification, characterization and antioxidant activity of polysaccharides from Flammulina velutipes residue  ap. 71-77.  aIn this study, we isolated polysaccharides from Flammulina velutipes residue (FVRP) using microwave-assisted extraction and then purified the polysaccharides by column chromatography to yield FVRP-1, FVRP-2 and FVRP-3. The structural characteristics of FVRP-1, FVRP-2 and FVRP-3 were investigated, and their antioxidant activities against ABTS+, DPPH and hydroxyl radicals were also analyzed in vitro. FVRP-1 was found to be neutral and rich in galactose. However, FVRP-2 and FVRP-3 were acidic polysaccharides and were rich in glucose. The average molecular weight of FVRP-1, FVRP-2 and FVRP-3 were 29,930, 62,290, and 36,310Da, respectively. The glycosyl residue of FVRP-1 was an α-type glycosidic linkage, whereas FVRP-2 and FVRP-3 were β-type glycosidic linkages. We found FVRP-1, FVRP-2 and FVRP-3 had strong potential antioxidant activities in the order of FVRP-1<FVRP-3<FVRP-2. Our results thus suggested that FVRPs might be suitable for use as functional foods and as potential therapeutic agents.  aPublisher supplied data 3a2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl 3aFlammulina velutipes 3aantioxidant activity 3achromatography 3afunctional foods 3agalactose 3aglucose 3aglycosidic linkages 3ahydroxyl radicals 3amicrowave treatment 3amolecular weight 3apolysaccharides 0aFlammulina velutipes residue 0aPolysaccharide 0aPurification 0aCharacterization 0aAntioxidant activity1 aZhang, Bin1 aIbrahim, S.A.1 aGao, Shuang-Shuang1 aYang, Hong1 aHuang, Wen0 tCarbohydrate polymers.g2016 July 10, v. 145 p.71-77dElsevier LtdaElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl47819x0144-86177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbpol.2016.03.0203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03022naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002300149245010000172300001600272520145000288592002801738650001801766650001001784650000901794650001901803650001901822650001501841650002001856650001901876650003101895650001601926650002001942653004001962653004302002653003802045653004702083653004102130653002102171653001902192653003102211653002302242700002402265700002802289773013002317856008402447852000902531655001202540IND60557557520221120062122.0190412e201612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055755752DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ifset.2016.09.0272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAghajanzadeh, Sara10aEffect of infrared heating on degradation kinetics of key lime juice physicochemical properties  ap. 139-148.  aThe effect of IR heating on retention and kinetics of some physicochemical properties of key lime juice were investigated. The juice was thermally treated at 60, 70, 80 and 90°C in 15, 10, 5, 2.5min using IR and conventional thermal treatment in water bath. The effect of heating on ascorbic acid (AA), pectin methylesterase (PME), cloud stability and color of the juice were studied. The higher Z-value of AA during IR heating (25.12°C) indicated the higher thermal resistance of this vitamin compared to conventional method (24.15°C)). Higher PME inactivation and cloud stability were observed during conventional treatment. IR heating was effective in color preservation of the juice because of lower changes in browning index and L*×a*×b* combination. All these obtained results were related to shorter come up time during IR heating. Finally, correlation matrix was used to evaluate the linear relation between the juice properties.In this study, infrared (IR) heating was used as an alternative method for key lime juice thermal processing. Come up time decreased due to quick rising in initial temperature of the juice to the target temperature during IR heating. Hence, the juice was heated less during this method compared to the conventional thermal treatment in water bath. Totally, IR heating could be introduced as a new and effective method for the preservation of nutritional values and color of juice such as key lime juice.  aPublisher supplied data 3aascorbic acid 3acolor 3aheat 3aheat tolerance 3aheat treatment 3alime juice 3anutritive value 3apectinesterase 3aphysicochemical properties 3atemperature 3awater treatment 0aSodium chloride (PubChem CID: 5234) 0aSodium hydroxide (PubChem CID: 14,798) 0aSulfuric acid (PubChem CID: 1118) 0aPotassium iodate (PubChem CID: 23,665,710) 0aPotassium iodide (PubChem CID: 4875) 0aInfrared heating 0aKey lime juice 0aPhysicochemical properties 0aCorrelation matrix1 aKashaninejad, Mahdi1 aZiaiifar, Aman Mohammad0 tInnovative food science & emerging technologies.g2016 Dec., v. 38 p.139-148dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl69720x1466-85647nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ifset.2016.09.0273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03926naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001500149245011000164506011700274506007600391520220200467592002802669506003702697650002202734650001602756650000902772650002302781650002102804650002202825650001902847650002302866650002702889650002002916650001102936650001302947651001002960653002502970653002202995653002103017653002003038653002203058700001703080700001103097700001603108700001503124700001803139700001603157700001803173773010003191856008403291852000903375655001203384IND60766509620221207075544.0220606e202204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076650962DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aqrep.2022.1010312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLu, Cuiyun10aNovel microsatellites reveal wild populations genetic variance in pike-perch (Sander lucioperca) in China  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe pike-perch (Sander lucioperca) is a native fish species in European and Asian river basins. Owing to its fast growth rate, strong adaptability, and high nutritional value, it has become a promising candidate species for aquaculture. However, information on the genetic background of these wild populations is still limited, hindering the protection and sustainable utilisation of genetic resources in China. The aim of this study was to screen a set of microsatellite markers and assess the genetic variation of six pike-perch populations in China. A total of 92,162 pairs of microsatellite primers were designed. Among them, dinucleotide repeats were the most abundant microsatellites (81.47%), followed by trinucleotides (8.21%), tetranucleotides (7.59%), and pentanucleotide repeat microsatellites (2.73%). Of the 200 pairs of synthesised primers, 122 exhibited obvious repeat-length polymorphisms. Thirty polymorphic markers were selected to analyse six populations of pike-perch collected from China. The average number of alleles (Nₐ) and effective alleles (Nₑ) per population varied from 2.333(WR) to 7.800(UL) and from 1.787(KL) to 4.435(UL), respectively. The observed heterozygosity (Hₒ) and polymorphism information content (PIC) ranged from 0.377(KL) to 0.796(TL) and from 0.304(KL) to 0.715(UL), respectively. The results showed that four populations were highly polymorphic (PIC≥0.5), two populations were moderately polymorphic (0.25≤PIC<0.5). The FST estimated using the analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) was 0.2090, indicating moderate levels of genetic differentiation among the populations. Results from the UPGMA dendrogram, structure analysis, and PCA analysis showed that the six populations of pike-perch were largely divided into two genetically distinct groups. The four populations, UL, TL, HR, and YR, were highly significantly different from KL and WR in northeast China. These populations can be utilised for breeding programmes to achieve substantial genetic variations in their descendants. Genetic diversity and structure analysis of populations will provide useful information for conservation management and effective utilisation of pike-perch.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aSander lucioperca 3aaquaculture 3afish 3agenetic background 3agenetic variance 3agenetic variation 3aheterozygosity 3aindigenous species 3amicrosatellite repeats 3anutritive value 3arivers 3avariance 3aChina 0aNovel microsatellite 0aGenetic diversity 0aGenetic variance 0aWild population 0aSander lucioperca1 aSun, Zhipeng1 aXu, Pu1 aNa, Rongbin1 aLv, Weihua1 aCao, Dingchen1 aLiu, Tianqi1 aZheng, Xianhu0 tAquaculture reports.g2022 Apr., v. 23 p.101031-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23215x2352-51347nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aqrep.2022.1010313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03450naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002500151245009600176300001600272520190200288592002802190650001902218650001202237650001202249650001002261650001602271650002002287650002302307650002302330650001602353650001902369650001802388650002102406650001202427650001902439650001502458650001502473650002302488650001702511651000902528653001302537653001202550653002302562653001802585653002202603700002402625700002402649700003102673773010902704856008602813852000902899655001202908IND60564915220221121085146.0190319e20161101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056491522DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scienta.2016.09.0202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMirsafi, Zahra-Sadat10aAssessment of AquaCrop model for simulating growth and yield of saffron (Crocus sativus L.)  ap. 343-351.  aAquaCrop is among the crop growth models that simulates the effect of water stress on yield and biomass of field crops. AquaCrop model has been parameterized for the majority of field crops; however, it still lacks the parameterization of the saffron as a perennial crop. Since saffron growth lasts for several years, therefore, simulating saffron yield and biomass is much more complex than other crops. In this study, the AquaCrop model was calibrated and validated based on the dataset of a 6-year experiment in the semi-arid area of Iran. The data consisted of different combinations of irrigation managements including full irrigation, different levels of deficit irrigation, and rainfed (no irrigation). Primary analysis revealed that unlike former studies on annual crops, it was needed to define a set of normalized water productivity and harvest index for each year of experiment. Therefore a single crop file was defined for each year of simulation. This was due to the fact that saffron yield of each year is a function of corms growth in the preceding year. Results showed that the model could simulate soil water content well in different soil depth with overall normalized root mean square error (NRMSE)=14%. The model also simulates the potential evapotranspiration fairly with NRMSE=27%. However, the model could simulate the saffron yield satisfactorily with overall NRMSE=11%. In addition the NRMSE=25% was obtained for biomass simulation pooled over the six years. Results suggested that the AquaCrop may be used for simulating the saffron yield for the whole growing seasons, while it was more accurate for simulating biomass for the earlier years and lost its precision in the last years of growth. Finally, it was concluded that the AquaCrop could be also used for simulating perennial crops satisfactorily provided that the model parameterized carefully and calibrated well.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCrocus sativus 3aannuals 3abiomass 3acorms 3acrop models 3adata collection 3adeficit irrigation 3aevapotranspiration 3afield crops 3agrowing season 3aharvest index 3airrigation rates 3asaffron 3asemiarid zones 3asoil depth 3asoil water 3asoil water content 3awater stress 3aIran 0aAquaCrop 0aSaffron 0aWater productivity 0aHarvest index 0aYield and biomass1 aSepaskhah, Ali Reza1 aAhmadi, Seyed Hamid1 aKamgar-Haghighi, Ali Akbar0 tScientia horticulturae.g2016 Nov. 01, v. 211 p.343-351dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4108x0304-42387nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scienta.2016.09.0203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03048naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002900144245011000173300001600283506002800299520129100327592002801618506003701646650002001683650002701703650001301730650001301743650001201756650002501768650000901793650002301802650002101825650002201846650001801868650001701886650001901903650001601922650001001938650001101948653001601959653001701975653001901992700002702011700003102038700003102069700003302100700002902133700002602162700003402188700002702222700003002249773010302279856007902382852000902461655001202470IND60678760020221207115408.0200612e20191202xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067876002DNAL7 a10.1515/opag-2019-00662doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWong-Villarreal, Arnoldo10aBacteria from Jatropha curcas rhizosphere, degrades aromatic hydrocarbons and promotes growth in Zea mays  ap. 641-649.  aResource is Open Access  aThe rhizosphere is one of the most important reservoirs of microorganisms. Because of the microbial metabolic activities, these can be used for various biotechnological, agricultural and environmental purposes. In this study we evaluated five genetically related bacterial strains; Pseudomonas aeruginosa N7B1 (MG457074), Pseudomonas sp. (MG457075), Pseudomonas sp., Bf1 (MG457076) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa F23 (MG457077), isolated from Jatropha curcas rhizosphere, capable of growing and degradating benzene and phenanthrene. The hydrocarbon degradation by these strains was quantified by gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrophotometry. The Pseudomonas aeruginosa N7B1 strain removed 84% of phenanthrene and 45% of benzene in a seven-day period, while the other strains showed a lower hydrocarbon degradation capacity. Another biotechno-logical feature of these strains is maize growth promotion, in a substrate enriched with 0.5% of phenanthrene and 1.0% of benzene. Pseudomonas aeruginosa N7B1 and Pseudomonas aeruginosa F23 showed an increase in root and shoot fresh and dry weight, plant height and root length variables. These results open the possible use of these strains as bioinoculants to promote the growth of maize plants in phenanthrene and benzene polluted soils.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aJatropha curcas 3aPseudomonas aeruginosa 3aZea mays 3abacteria 3abenzene 3abiochemical pathways 3acorn 3agas chromatography 3agrowth promotion 3amass spectrometry 3aphenanthrenes 3aplant height 3apolluted soils 3arhizosphere 3aroots 3ashoots 0aPseudomonas 0aPhenanthrene 0aBiodegradation1 aYañez-Ocampo, Gustavo1 aHernández-Nuñez, Emanuel1 aCorzo-González, Hipólito1 aGiácoman Vallejos, Germán,1 aGonzález-Sánchez, Avel1 aGómez-Velasco, Diana1 aRamírez González, Sandra I.1 aLópez Báez, Orlando,1 aEspinosa Zaragoza, Saúl,0 tOpen Agriculture.g2019 Dec. 02, v. 4, no. 1 p.641-649dDe GruyterwJournal:23162x2391-95317nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1515/opag-2019-00663Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03400naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001400150245010300164300001400267520172700281592002802008650001102036650001402047650002202061650001902083650001402102650001202116650002602128650001702154650001702171650001002188650001702198650001502215650003002230650003702260650001102297650003202308650002002340650001502360651001002375651001802385653001902403653000902422653001802431653001302449653002202462700001702484700001802501700001702519700001402536700001502550700001402565700002002579773010502599856008502704852000902789655001202798IND60583850820221116213941.0200830e201802  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058385082DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envpol.2017.10.0332doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShi, Peng10aToxicological and chemical insights into representative source and drinking water in eastern China  ap. 35-44.  aDrinking water safety is continuously threatened by the emergence of numerous toxic organic pollutants (TOPs) in environmental waters. In this study, an approach integrating in vitro bioassays and chemical analyses was performed to explore toxicological profiles of representative source and drinking water from waterworks of the Yangtze River (Yz), Taihu Lake (Th), and the Huaihe River (Hh) basins in eastern China. Overall, 34 of 96 TOPs were detected in all water samples, with higher concentrations in both source and drinking water samples of Hh, and pollutant profiles also differed across different river basins. Non-specific bioassays indicated that source water samples of Hh waterworks showed higher genotoxicity and mutagenicity than samples of Yz and Th. An EROD assay demonstrated dioxin-like toxicity which was detected in 5 of 7 source water samples, with toxin concentration levels ranging from 62.40 to 115.51 picograms TCDD equivalents per liter of water (eq./L). PAHs and PCBs were not the main contributors to observed dioxin-like toxicity in detected samples. All source water samples induced estrogenic activities of 8.00–129.00 nanograms 17β-estradiol eq./L, and estrogens, including 17α-ethinylestradiol and estriol, contributed 40.38–84.15% of the observed activities in examined samples. While drinking water treatments efficiently removed TOPs and their toxic effects, and estrogenic activity was still observed in drinking water samples of Hh. Altogether, this study indicated that the representative source water in eastern China, especially that found in Hh, may negatively affect human health, a finding that demonstrates an urgent requirement for advanced drinking water treatments.  aPublisher supplied data 3abasins 3abioassays 3achemical analysis 3adrinking water 3aestradiol 3aestriol 3aestrogenic properties 3agenotoxicity 3ahuman health 3alakes 3amutagenicity 3apollutants 3apolychlorinated biphenyls 3apolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons 3arivers 3atetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin 3awater utilities 3awatersheds 3aChina 3aYangtze River 0aDrinking water 0aEROD 0aERα/AR-CALUX 0aToxicity 0aOrganic pollutant1 aZhou, Sicong1 aXiao, Hongxia1 aQiu, Jingfan1 aLi, Aimin1 aZhou, Qing1 aPan, Yang1 aHollert, Henner0 tEnvironmental pollution.g2018 Feb., v. 233 p.35-44dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl41014x0269-74917nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2017.10.0333Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03368naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245015500166300001600321520160500337592002801942650002901970650001801999650001002017650001402027650002002041650001502061650001502076650001102091650001702102650001902119650001902138650001902157650001802176650001802194650001302212650001302225650001702238650002402255653001002279653001702289653001702306653001402323653001902337700002902356700003202385700002702417700002402444700002602468700003202494700002002526700002702546773011302573856008302686852000902769655001202778IND60729638220221117054727.0211106e202105  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072963822DNAL7 a10.1016/j.rvsc.2021.02.0222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSainz, Ángel10aEffect of chemically modified tetracycline-8 (CMT-8) on hematology, blood chemistry, cytokines and peripheral blood lymphocyte subsets of healthy dogs  ap. 200-208.  aTetracyclines are antibiotics widely used in human and veterinary medicine. Effects on the immune system and inflammatory response, including effects on blood leukocytes proliferation and function and in cytokines synthesis, have been described. Chemically modified tetracyclines (CMT) have lost their antimicrobial activity, but maintain these other properties. This study analyzes the effect of chemically modified tetracycline-8 (CMT-8) on the evolution of complete blood count, blood chemistry, the mRNA expression of selected cytokines and peripheral blood lymphocyte subpopulations distribution in healthy dogs. CMT-8 at a dose of 10 mg/kg once daily was administered per os to six healthy dogs. A control group of five healthy dogs, living in the same conditions than dogs treated with CMT-8, received placebo with an identical therapeutic regimen. When given at the doses used in this study, no side effects of CMT-8 were detected, suggesting a good tolerance and a limited toxicity of the drug. Dogs treated with CMT-8 showed a gradual increase in mean corpuscular hemoglobin. The administration of CMT-8 in healthy dogs did not affect blood mRNA expression of IFN-γ, TNFα, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, IL-12 p40 and IL-13. However, the lymphocytes expressing class II MHC on their surface decreased during the first two weeks of CMT-8 treatment and subsequently increased for the next three months. Considering the absence of antimicrobial properties of the drug, the effects of CMT-8 detected in this study seem to be unrelated to the classical antimicrobial activity attributed to tetracyclines.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantimicrobial properties 3adrug toxicity 3adrugs 3aevolution 3agene expression 3ahematology 3ahemoglobin 3ahumans 3ainflammation 3ainterleukin-10 3ainterleukin-12 3ainterleukin-13 3ainterleukin-4 3ainterleukin-6 3aplacebos 3aresearch 3atherapeutics 3aveterinary medicine 0aCMT-8 0aTetracycline 0aClass II MHC 0aCytokines 0aFlow cytometry1 aGarcía-Sancho, Mercedes1 aRodríguez-Franco, Fernando1 aSan Andrés, Manuel I.1 aRodríguez, Casilda1 ade Lucas, José Julio1 aAndrés, María Dolores San1 aAgulla, Beatriz1 aVillaescusa, Alejandra0 tResearch in veterinary science.g2021 May, v. 136 p.200-208dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl45491x0034-52887nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rvsc.2021.02.0223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03224naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001400146245014200160300001800302520136700320592002801687650002201715650001201737650001001749650002401759650002701783650002801810650003001838650001501868650001001883650000901893650003701902650003101939650002001970650002001990650001502010650001802025650002202043650002302065653002602088653002702114653002302141653002402164653001902188700001502207700001802222700001802240700001302258700001702271700001302288700001602301700001202317700005602329773014802385856008002533852000902613655001202622IND60632300520221120023912.0190314e20190228xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063230052DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jafc.8b073132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSun, Jing10aFructooligosaccharides Ameliorating Cognitive Deficits and Neurodegeneration in APP/PS1 Transgenic Mice through Modulating Gut Microbiota  ap. 3006-3017.  aAlzheimer’s disease (AD) is closely related to gut microbial alteration. Prebiotic fructooligosaccharides (FOS) play major roles by regulating gut microbiota. The present study aimed to explore the effect and mechanism of FOS protection against AD via regulating gut microbiota. Male Apse/PSEN 1dE9 (APP/PS1) transgenic (Tg) mice were administrated with FOS for 6 weeks. Cognitive deficits and amyloid deposition were evaluated. The levels of synaptic plasticity markers including postsynaptic density protein 95 (PSD-95) and synapsin I, as well as phosphorylation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), were determined. The intestinal microbial constituent was detected by 16S rRNA sequencing. Moreover, the levels of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) in the gut and GLP-1 receptor (GLP-1R) in the brain were measured. The results indicated that FOS treatment ameliorated cognitive deficits and pathological changes in the Tg mice. FOS significantly upregulated the expression levels of synapsin I and PSD-95, as well as decreased phosphorylated level of JNK. The sequencing results showed that FOS reversed the altered microbial composition. Furthermore, FOS increased the level of GLP-1 and decreased the level of GLP-1R in the Tg mice. These findings indicated that FOS exerted beneficial effects against AD via regulating the gut microbiota-GLP-1/GLP-1R pathway.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAlzheimer disease 3aamyloid 3abrain 3acognitive disorders 3afructooligosaccharides 3aglucagon-like peptide 1 3aintestinal microorganisms 3aintestines 3amales 3amice 3amitogen-activated protein kinase 3aneurodegenerative diseases 3aneuroplasticity 3aphosphorylation 3aprebiotics 3aribosomal RNA 3asequence analysis 3atransgenic animals 0aAlzheimer’s disease 0afructooligosaccharides 0acognitive deficits 0asynaptic plasticity 0agut microbiota1 aLiu, Suzhi1 aLing, Zongxin1 aWang, Fangyan1 aLing, Yi1 aGong, Tianyu1 aFang, Na1 aYe, Shiqing1 aSi, Jue1 aLiu, Jiaming1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0483-31870 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2019 Feb. 28, v. 67, no. 10 p.3006-3017dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:12177x1520-51187nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jafc.8b073133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03703naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245015200169300001800321520208300339592002802422650001502450650002202465650001602487650001502503650000902518650002102527650001702548650003402565650001302599650001902612650001702631650002402648650001202672650001602684651001902700651001802719653003202737653002802769653002902797653001802826653002602844700005702870700001702927700002002944700001802964773010902982856008503091852000903176655001203185IND60583850920221116214043.0200830e201802  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058385092DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envpol.2017.10.0142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGhosal, Sutapa10aMolecular identification of polymers and anthropogenic particles extracted from oceanic water and fish stomach – A Raman micro-spectroscopy study  ap. 1113-1124.  aPacific Ocean trawl samples, stomach contents of laboratory-raised fish as well as fish from the subtropical gyres were analyzed by Raman micro-spectroscopy (RMS) to identify polymer residues and any detectable persistent organic pollutants (POP). The goal was to access specific molecular information at the individual particle level in order to identify polymer debris in the natural environment. The identification process was aided by a laboratory generated automated fluorescence removal algorithm. Pacific Ocean trawl samples of plastic debris associated with fish collection sites were analyzed to determine the types of polymers commonly present. Subsequently, stomach contents of fish from these locations were analyzed for ingested polymer debris. Extraction of polymer debris from fish stomach using KOH versus ultrapure water were evaluated to determine the optimal method of extraction. Pulsed ultrasonic extraction in ultrapure water was determined to be the method of choice for extraction with minimal chemical intrusion. The Pacific Ocean trawl samples yielded primarily polyethylene (PE) and polypropylene (PP) particles >1 mm, PE being the most prevalent type. Additional microplastic residues (1 mm - 10 μm) extracted by filtration, included a polystyrene (PS) particle in addition to PE and PP. Flame retardant, deca-BDE was tentatively identified on some of the PP trawl particles. Polymer residues were also extracted from the stomachs of Atlantic and Pacific Ocean fish. Two types of polymer related debris were identified in the Atlantic Ocean fish: (1) polymer fragments and (2) fragments with combined polymer and fatty acid signatures. In terms of polymer fragments, only PE and PP were detected in the fish stomachs from both locations. A variety of particles were extracted from oceanic fish as potential plastic pieces based on optical examination. However, subsequent RMS examination identified them as various non-plastic fragments, highlighting the importance of chemical analysis in distinguishing between polymer and non-polymer residues.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3achemical analysis 3afatty acids 3afiltration 3afish 3aflame retardants 3afluorescence 3apersistent organic pollutants 3aplastics 3apolypropylenes 3apolystyrenes 3apotassium hydroxide 3astomach 3aultrasonics 3aAtlantic Ocean 3aPacific Ocean 0aMicroplastic identification 0aMicroplastic extraction 0aRaman micro-spectroscopy 0aMarine litter 0aFish stomach contents1 aChen, Michael1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0767-42381 aWagner, Jeff1 aWang, Zhong-Min1 aWall, Stephen0 tEnvironmental pollution.g2018 Feb., v. 233 p.1113-1124dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl41014x0269-74917nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2017.10.0143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03062naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100002200188245009800210300001800308506007600326520152200402592002801924506003701952650000801989650002201997650001302019650000902032650001802041650001102059650001402070650001402084650002202098650003302120650001302153650001402166653000902180653000802189653000802197653000902205653001902214653003402233700002002267700002302287700002202310773012202332856008102454852000902535655001202544IND60602451920221207133237.0180711e20150619xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060245192DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jmb.2015.03.0222doi7 aPMC44338182pmcid7 a258617622pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFyfe, Alastair C.10aStructural Variations and Solvent Structure of r(UGGGGU) Quadruplexes Stabilized by Sr2+ Ions  ap. 2205-2219.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aGuanine-rich sequences can, under appropriate conditions, adopt a distinctive, four-stranded, helical fold known as a G-quadruplex. Interest in quadruplex folds has grown in recent years as evidence of their biological relevance has accumulated from both sequence analysis and function-specific assays. The folds are unusually stable and their formation appears to require close management to maintain cell health; regulatory failure correlates with genomic instability and a number of cancer phenotypes. Biologically relevant quadruplex folds are anticipated to form transiently in mRNA and in single-stranded, unwound DNA. To elucidate factors, including bound solvent, that contribute to the stability of RNA quadruplexes, we examine, by X-ray crystallography and small-angle X-ray scattering, the structure of a previously reported tetramolecular quadruplex, UGGGGU stabilized by Sr²⁺ ions. Crystal forms of the octameric assembly formed by this sequence exhibit unusually strong diffraction and anomalous signal enabling the construction of reliable models to a resolution of 0.88Å. The solvent structure confirms hydration patterns reported for other nucleic acid helical conformations and provides support for the greater stability of RNA quadruplexes relative to DNA. Novel features detected in the octameric RNA assembly include a new crystal form, evidence of multiple conformations and structural variations in the 3′ U tetrad, including one that leads to the formation of a hydrated internal cavity.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDNA 3aX-ray diffraction 3agenomics 3aions 3amessenger RNA 3amodels 3aneoplasms 3aphenotype 3asequence analysis 3asmall-angle X-ray scattering 3asolvents 3astrontium 0aSAXS 0aNCS 0aASU 0aSSRL 0aRNA quadruplex 0ahigh-resolution RNA structure1 aDunten, Pete W.1 aMartick, Monika M.1 aScott, William G.0 tJournal of molecular biology.g2015 June 19, v. 427, no. 12 p.2205-2219dElsevier LtdwJournal:12469x0022-28367nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jmb.2015.03.0223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03533naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001700146245016800163300001800331520169400349592002802043650002202071650002102093650002302114650001402137650001402151650001302165650001902178650002002197650002102217650001602238650002802254650004202282650002102324650002202345650002202367650002102389650002002410650002202430650000902452650002002461650002502481651001002506653001002516653001602526653002102542653002202563653002102585700001502606700001502621700001402636700005702650773014702707856008002854852000902934655001202943IND60632300720221120041227.0190314e20190219xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063230072DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jafc.9b000372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhuang, Shen10aRhein from Rheum rhabarbarum Inhibits Hydrogen-Peroxide-Induced Oxidative Stress in Intestinal Epithelial Cells Partly through PI3K/Akt-Mediated Nrf2/HO-1 Pathways  ap. 2519-2529.  aRheum rhabarbarum has been widely used as a herbal medicine and food in China. The objective of this study was to investigate the cytoprotective action and underlying mechanisms of rhein, one active ingredient isolated from R. rhabarbarum, on H₂O₂-challenged rat small intestine epithelial cells (IEC-6 cells). H₂O₂-challenged IEC-6 cells were incubated in the pretreatment with or without rhein or LY294002, a PI3K/Akt inhibitor. The cell viability, apoptosis, intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS), and antioxidants were measured. The expressions of heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1), nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor (Nrf2), Akt, and p-Akt were evaluated by western blotting. Meanwhile, LY294002 was also used to investigate the role of PI3K/Akt in the rhein-induced cytoprotective role. The results showed that pretreatment of rhein could reverse the inhibition of cell viability and suppress the apoptosis, caspase-3 activity, and intracellular ROS induced by H₂O₂. Rhein also supported SOD activity catalase activity, glutathione S-transferase activity, and glutathione content. Furthermore, rhein induced the protein expression of HO-1 together with its upstream mediator Nrf2 and activated the phosphorylation of Akt in IEC-6 cells. LY294002 inhibited increased cell viability, upregulated the lowered apoptotic rate, and enhanced the weakened ROS levels. Although the inhibition of PI3K/Akt did not inhibit the Nrf2 nuclear level under 4 μM rhein, LY294002 inhibited the Nrf2 nuclear level under 2 μM rhein and blocked HO-1 expression. These data demonstrated that rhein protected IEC-6 cells against oxidative damage partly via PI3K/Akt and Nrf2/HO-1 pathways.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRheum rhabarbarum 3aWestern blotting 3aactive ingredients 3aapoptosis 3acaspase-3 3acatalase 3acell viability 3aenzyme activity 3aepithelial cells 3aglutathione 3aglutathione transferase 3aheme oxygenase (biliverdin-producing) 3aherbal medicines 3ahydrogen peroxide 3aintestinal mucosa 3aoxidative stress 3aphosphorylation 3aprotein synthesis 3arats 3asmall intestine 3asuperoxide dismutase 3aChina 0aRhein 0aIEC-6 cells 0aoxidative stress 0aNrf2/HO-1 pathway 0aPI3K/Akt pathway1 aYu, Ruyang1 aZhong, Jia1 aLiu, Ping1 aLiu, Zhongjie1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0790-36350 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2019 Feb. 19, v. 67, no. 9 p.2519-2529dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:12177x1520-51187nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jafc.9b000373Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01937naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001400145245012800159300001600287520079800303592002801101650001901129650000901148650001201157650001301169650001701182650001101199650002101210650001501231650001301246651001001259651001701269700001701286700001701303700001501320700001801335700001601353773010101369856004801470852000901518655001201527IND4486251020221121053916.0120921e201209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND448625102DNAL7 a10.1007/s11707-012-0329-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHan, Fang10aLate Pleistocene sedimentary sequences and paleoclimate changes in Xunhua basin in the upper reach of Yellow River in China  ap. 297-305.  aThe third terrace of the Yellow River was well developed in Xunhua basin in the north-east margin of the Tibetan Plateau.

Herein, particulate matter (PM) emitted from biomass burning in the Amazon region during two different periods, namely intense and moderate, was investigated. This study focused on: i) organic characterization of nitro- and oxy-polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs); ii) assessment of the excess lifetime cancer risk (LCR); and iii) assessment of the in vitro mutagenic effects of extractable organic matter (EOM). Further, we compared the sensitivity of two mutagenicity tests: Salmonella/microsome test and cytokinesis-block micronucleus (CBMN) with human lung cells. Among the nitro-PAHs, 2-nitrofluoranthene, 7-nitrobenz[a]anthracene, 1-nitropyrene, and 3-nitrofluoranthene showed the highest concentrations, while among oxy-PAHs, 2-metylanthraquinone, benz[a]anthracene-7,12-dione, and 9,10-anthraquinone were the most abundant. The LCR calculated for nitro-PAH exposure during intense biomass burning period showed a major contribution of 6-nitrochrysene to human carcinogenic risk. The EOM from intense period was more mutagenic than that from moderate period for both TA98 and YG1041 Salmonella strains. The number of revertants for YG1041 was 5–50% higher than that for TA98, and the most intense responses were obtained in the absence of metabolic activation, suggesting that nitroaromatic compounds with direct-acting frameshift mutagenic activity are contributing to the DNA damage. Treatment of cells with non-cytotoxic doses of EOM resulted in an increase in micronuclei frequencies. The minimal effective dose showed that Salmonella/microsome test was considerably more sensitive in comparison with CBMN mainly for the intense burning period samples. This was the first study to assess the mutagenicity of EOM associated with PM collected in the Amazon region using Salmonella/microsome test. The presence of compounds with mutagenic effects, particularly nitro- and oxy-PAHs, and LCR values in the range of 10⁻⁵ indicate that the population is potentially exposed to an increased risk of DNA damage, mutation, and cancer.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA damage 3aSalmonella 3aadverse effects 3aanthracenes 3abiomass 3aburning 3aemissions 3agenotoxicity tests 3ahuman health 3ahumans 3amutagenicity 3amutagens 3amutation 3aneoplasms 3anitroaromatic compounds 3aorganic matter 3aparticulates 3arisk 3aAmazonia 3aBrazil 0aBrazilian Amazon 0aBiomass burning 0aNitro-PAHs and oxy-PAHs 0aSalmonella/microsome assay 0aCytokinesis-block micronucleus (CBMN) 0aB[a]Peq 0aCBMN 0aEOM 0aLCR 0aMED1.5 0aMN 0aNDI 0aPAHs 0aPM 0aTEF1 ade Oliveira Alves, Nilmara1 aFerreira, Paula Anastácia1 aCaumo, Sofia1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7471-49361 ade Castro Vasconcellos, Pérola1 aArtaxo Netto, Paulo Eduardo,1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7754-30361 ade Souza Hacon, Sandra1 aRoubicek, Deborah Arnsdorff1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4516-53491 aBatistuzzo de Medeiros, Silvia Regina0 tEnvironmental pollution.g2018 Feb., v. 233 p.960-970dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl41014x0269-74917nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2017.09.0683Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02780naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002400146245007200170300001800242520134400260592002801604650002301632650001101655650002201666650001101688650001101699650001901710650001001729650001801739650000901757650001501766650001701781653001601798653001501814653001601829653002401845653001601869653001701885700006401902700006101966700005802027773014802085856008002233852000902313655001202322IND60632300920221120041200.0190314e20190219xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063230092DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jafc.9b000742doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBoeswetter, Anke R.10aIdentification of the Key Aroma Compounds in Gluten-Free Rice Bread  ap. 2963-2972.  aRice flour is commonly used as a raw material in the preparation of gluten-free bread. However, compared to wheat bread, its aroma is different and often not accepted by consumers. Aroma profile analyses of the crumb and crust of freshly baked rice bread indicated a strong rice-like flavor but lower intensities of the typical roasty wheat bread odor qualities. By application of aroma extract dilution analyses (AEDA), the most odor active compounds in both rice and wheat bread samples were characterized. In addition, two batches of rice flour were used. In particular, 2-aminoacetophenone and 4-vinylphenol reached high flavor dilution (FD) factors in the rice bread samples but were not detected in wheat bread. In the rice bread crust 1-octene-3-one, (E)-2-nonenal, and 4-methylquinazoline reached significantly higher FD factors than in the wheat bread crust, while those of maltol and 2-methoxy-4-vinylphenol were significantly lower. In a stored rice flour and in the corresponding rice bread, lipid degradation products such as hexanal were more intense compared to fresh rice flour. Finally, five aroma-active compounds, namely, 2-butyl-2-heptenal, 2-propyl-2-octenal, 4-hydroxy-2-octenoic acid lactone, 4-hydroxy-2-nonenoic acid lactone, and 4-methylquinazoline, were identified for the first time in rice-containing products.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactive ingredients 3aflavor 3agluten-free bread 3alipids 3amaltol 3aodor compounds 3aodors 3araw materials 3arice 3arice flour 3astored grain 0agluten-free 0arice bread 0awheat bread 0a2-aminoacetophenone 0aflour aging 0aHRGC-QTOF-MS1 aScherf, Katharina A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8315-54001 aSchieberle, Peter1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4153-27271 aKoehler, Peter1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7766-91810 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2019 Feb. 19, v. 67, no. 10 p.2963-2972dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:12177x1520-51187nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jafc.9b000743Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03341naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245011200168300001600280520175900296592002802055650001402083650002602097650001302123650002602136650001502162650001102177650002502188650001902213650001002232650001702242650001002259650001702269650001402286650001502300650001502315650001502330650000902345650002302354650001602377650001502393650002002408653002502428653001702453653003202470653003802502700001602540700001802556700001202574773010702586856008502693852000902778655001202787IND60583851220221116213254.0200830e201802  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058385122DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envpol.2017.09.0842doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Menglu10aCo-selection of antibiotic resistance via copper shock loading on bacteria from a drinking water bio-filter  ap. 132-141.  aHeavy metal contamination of source water frequently occurred in developing countries as a result of accidents. To address the problems, most of the previous studies have focused on engineering countermeasures. In this study, we investigated the effects of heavy metals, particularly copper, on the development of antibiotic resistance by establishing a copper shock loading test. Results revealed that co-selection occurred rapidly within 6 h. Copper, at the levels of 10 and 100 mg/L, significantly increased bacterial resistance to the antibiotics tested, including rifampin, erythromycin, kanamycin, and a few others. A total of 117 antimicrobial-resistance genes were detected from 12 types of genes, and the relative abundance of most genes (particularly mobile genetic elements intⅠand transposons) was markedly enriched by at least one fold. Furthermore, the copper shock loading altered the bacterial community. Numerous heavy metal and antibiotic resistant strains were screened out and enriched. These strains are expected to enhance the overall level of resistance. More noticeably, the majority of the co-selected antibiotic resistance could sustain for at least 20 h in the absence of copper and antimicrobial drugs. Resistance to vancomycin, erythromycin and lincomycin even could remain for 7 days. The prominent selection pressure by the copper shock loading implies that a real accident most likely poses similar impacts on the water environment. An accidental release of heavy metals would not only cause harm to the ecological environment, but also contribute to the development of bacterial antibiotic resistance. Broader concerns should be raised about the biological risks caused by sudden releases of pollutants by accidents.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaccidents 3aantibiotic resistance 3abacteria 3abacterial communities 3abiofilters 3acopper 3adeveloping countries 3adrinking water 3adrugs 3aerythromycin 3agenes 3aheavy metals 3akanamycin 3alincomycin 3apollutants 3arifampicin 3arisk 3aselection pressure 3atransposons 3avancomycin 3awater pollution 0aCopper shock loading 0aCo-selection 0aAntibiotic resistance genes 0aAntibiotic resistance maintenance1 aChen, Lihua1 aYe, Chengsong1 aYu, Xin0 tEnvironmental pollution.g2018 Feb., v. 233 p.132-141dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl41014x0269-74917nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2017.09.0843Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01503naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245008100167300001800248520051500266592002800781650001600809650002200825650002000847653000700867653000900874653001500883653001000898653001000908653001400918653002000932773012300952856008101075852000901156655001201165IND60602452220221122051531.0180711e20150911xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060245222DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jmb.2015.04.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTaguchi, Hideki10aReaction Cycle of Chaperonin GroEL via Symmetric “Football” Intermediate  ap. 2912-2918.  aChaperonin GroEL is an essential chaperone that assists in protein folding in the cell.

Application of ‘JARA’ (‘Just Another Red-List Assessment,’ a Bayesian state-space tool used for IUCN Red List assessments) to updated information on the areas occupied by Cape Gannets and the nest densities of breeding birds at their six colonies, suggested that the species should be classified as Vulnerable. However, the rate of decrease of Cape Gannets in their most-recent generation exceeded that of the previous generation, primarily as a result of large decreases at Bird Island, Lambert’s Bay, and Malgas Island, off South Africa’s west coast (the western part of their range). Since the 1960s, there has been an ongoing redistribution of the species from northwest to southeast around southern Africa, and ∼70% of the population now occurs on the south coast of South Africa, at Bird Island in Algoa Bay, on the eastern border of the BUS. Recruitment rather than adult survival may be limiting the present population; however, information on the seabird’s demographic parameters and mortality in fisheries is lacking for colonies in the northern part of the BUS. Presently, major threats to Cape Gannet include: substantially decreased availability of their preferred prey in the west; heavy mortalities of eggs, chicks and fledglings at and around colonies, inflicted by Cape Fur Seals Arctocephalus pusillus and other seabirds; substantial disturbance at colonies caused by Cape Fur Seals attacking adult gannets ashore; oiling; and disease.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArctocephalus pusillus pusillus 3aBayesian theory 3aMorus capensis 3aadults 3abreeding 3achicks 3acoasts 3aecosystems 3aeggs 3afisheries 3afledglings 3aislands 3amortality 3anests 3aseabirds 3aSouth Africa 0aBayesian state-space model 0aBenguela ecosystem 0acolonies 0aconservation status 0aIUCN Red List assessment 0apopulation decline 0aseabird conservation1 aCrawford, Robert JM1 aDyer, Bruce M1 aKemper, Jessica1 aMakhado, Azwianewi B1 aMasotla, Makhudu1 aPichegru, Lorien1 aPistorius, Pierre A.,1 aRoux, Jean-Paul1 aRyan, Peter G1 aTom, Desmond1 aUpfold, Leshia1 aWinker, Henning0 tOstrich.g2019 Dec. 13, v. 90, no. 4 p.335-346dTaylor & FranciswJournal:12300x1727-947X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2989/00306525.2019.16843963Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01162naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100002200142245004100164300001500205520029600220592002800516650001500544650001100559651001100570653001500581653002200596653002400618773014500642856007600787852000900863655001200872IND60594863220221120180355.0180524e201805  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059486322DNAL7 a10.1660/062.121.02102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aArruda, Joseph A.10aTwo New Land Snail Species in Kansas  ap. 98-102.  aNew collections of terrestrial gastropods in Kansas have extended the number of known land snail species by two.

As a first step in understanding this stork’s true status, we collated all available data to develop a distribution map and then investigated range-wide patterns of occurrence. The updated map greatly improves on past knowledge of the stork’s distribution and helps to identify regions where range contractions have occurred, particularly in Central Africa and parts of West Africa. We found that the stork’s distribution closely overlaps with protected areas and that there has been an overall increase in surface water (largely manmade water bodies)—a proxy for habitat—across the species’ extent of occurrence in recent decades. While this research represents a valuable contribution to our understanding of the Saddle-billed Stork, it also highlights the need for unbiased empirical data, especially from areas that are poorly surveyed, for developing a science-based conservation status assessment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aconservation areas 3aconservation status 3asurface water 3aCentral Africa 3aWestern Africa 0aAfrica 0aconservation assessment 0apopulation trends 0aprotected areas 0aSaddlebill 0asurveys 0awetlands1 aWeckerly, Floyd1 aSundar, KS Gopi0 tOstrich.g2019 Dec. 13, v. 90, no. 4 p.347-357dTaylor & FranciswJournal:12300x1727-947X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2989/00306525.2019.16969003Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03406naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002800149245009800177300001600275500001500291520169400306592002802000650003202028650002602060650001402086650001702100650002002117650003702137650001302174650001002187650001702197650002702214650001502241650001002256650002502266650001202291650002402303650002102327653001602348653001802364653002102382653001002403653001702413653001702430700003202447700003002479700003202509700002702541700002902568700002002597773013002617856008402747852000902831655001202840IND60557558520221120074528.0190412e201612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055755852DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ifset.2016.10.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSoares, Juliana Marques10aAntimicrobial and antioxidant activity of liquid smoke and its potential application to bacon  ap. 189-197.  a2019-12-06  aThe aim of the present study was to evaluate the liquid smoke antioxidant and antimicrobial capabilities and its implementation potential on bacon, due to its oxidizing stability. The liquid smoke presented an inhibitory effect on the Escherichia coli, Salmonella choleraesuis, Staphylococcus aureus and Listeria monocytogenes microorganisms with minimal bactericidal concentration ranging from 7.5 to 15%. The liquid smoke's antioxidant activity presented 0.24mg/mL of IC50. Regarding the fatty acids, there has been a significant increase (p<0.05) of oleic acid and a decrease of the linoleic one after storage and consequently forming hydro peroxides, malonaldehyde and hexanal, especially when a greater dilution of liquid smoke was applied (1:2, smoke: water, v/v). Hexanal had not been detected up until 60days of storage and it was noted that there was a progressive increase from 75 to 90days of storage, correlated to the peroxides degradation (p<0.05). The use of liquid smoke provided a 43% cooking time reduction (hours) in relation to the conventional system, reducing considerably the production processing costs.The liquid smoke is an alternative to conventional smoking of meat products. The liquid smoke presented an inhibiting effect on Escherichia coli, Salmonella choleraesuis, Staphylococcus aureus and Listeria monocytogenes bacteria, showing also an antioxidant effect. In addition, liquid smoke reduced the processing time (hours) in about 43%, factor that can reduce significantly the costs related to the bacon productive process. With this kind of information, it will be possible to produce safer, economical and uniform smoked meat products using liquid smoke.  aPublisher supplied data 3ainhibitory concentration 50 3aStaphylococcus aureus 3aperoxides 3asmoked meats 3amalondialdehyde 3aminimum inhibitory concentration 3abacteria 3asmoke 3aliquid smoke 3aListeria monocytogenes 3aoleic acid 3abacon 3aantioxidant activity 3acooking 3aSalmonella enterica 3aEscherichia coli 0aAntioxidant 0aAntimicrobial 0aLipids oxidation 0aBacon 0aLiquid smoke 0aantioxidants1 ada Silva, Patricia Franklin1 aPuton, Bruna Maria Saorin1 aBrustolin, Adriane Pegoraro1 aCansian, Rogério Luis1 aDallago, Rogério Marcos1 aValduga, Eunice0 tInnovative food science & emerging technologies.g2016 Dec., v. 38 p.189-197dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl69720x1466-85647nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ifset.2016.10.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02695naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245010200159520174300261592002802004650002102032650001202053650000902065650002202074700002402096700002202120700001902142700002502161773012302186856007502309852000902384655001202393IND60754321320221121161825.0211023e20211012xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075432132DNAL7 a10.3390/nu131035722doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSantos, Ana F.10aRelation between Attachment and Obesity in Preschool Years: A Systematic Review of the Literature  aIncreasing evidence suggests that attachment plays an important role in obesity. However, few studies examined this relationship in preschool children. This study aimed to systematically examine the empirical, peer-reviewed evidence regarding the relationship between attachment quality and obesity in the preschool years. Using established guidelines, relevant peer-reviewed literature published between 2000 and July 2021 was searched through EBSCO. This yielded a total of 1124 records for review. Established inclusion criteria comprised: empirical studies published in peer-review journals; include at least one anthropometric measure and/or food consumption measure. Exclusion criteria comprised: attachment measures not following Bowlby-Ainsworth conceptualization of the construct; children in institutionalized settings; context of severe mental illness, documented substance use disorders, or eating disorders; include only a measure of the psychological aspects of eating; intervention programs. After exclusions, eight studies with a total of 9225 participants met the inclusion criteria. Results support the role of attachment in weight-related outcomes, suggesting that considering attachment in the risk of obesity could contribute to the elaboration of effective prevention and intervention programs. Limitations included the small number of studies, predominately cross-sectional designs, the diversity of methodologies, most samples not including fathers, and lack of evidence about the developmental mechanisms underlying the association between attachment and obesity. More evidence is needed to determine how attachment and obesity are linked, and the potential underlying mechanisms accounting for this relationship.  aPublisher supplied data 3afood consumption 3aobesity 3arisk 3asystematic review1 aMartins, Mariana C.1 aFernandes, Carla 1 aBost, Kelly K.1 aVeríssimo, Manuela 0 tNutrients.g2021 Oct. 12, v. 13, no. 10dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2271x2072-66437nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/nu131035723Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01353naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002500143245009600168300001600264520026800280592002800548650001200576650002000588650002300608650002600631653003600657653002900693653002300722653003400745700002500779773013700804856007700941852000901018655001201027IND60521858120221116180129.0160531e20140602xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052185812DNAL7 a10.1515/znb-1989-04132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDehmlow, Eckehard V.10aNew Cyclopentadienones from Sterically Demanding Inner Acetylenes and Dicobalt-octacarbonyl  ap. 455-458.  aAcetylenes carrying one bulky substituent can be transformed into symmetrically or asymmetrically substituted cyclopentadienones 2 or 3 when they are heated with Co₂(CO)₈ and carbon monoxide.

For example, Ssa1 catalyzes multiple cellular functions, including protein transport and degradation, and to this end, the ssa1-45 mutant has proved invaluable. However, the biochemical defects associated with the corresponding Ssa1-45 protein (P417L) are unknown. Consequently, we characterized Ssa1 P417L, as well as a P417S variant, which corresponds to a mutation in the gene encoding the yeast mitochondrial Hsp70. We discovered that the P417L and P417S proteins exhibit accelerated ATPase activity that was similar to the Hsp40-stimulated rate of ATP hydrolysis of wild-type Ssa1. We also found that the mutant proteins were compromised for peptide binding. These data are consistent with defects in peptide-stimulated ATPase activity and with results from limited proteolysis experiments, which indicated that the mutants' substrate binding domains were highly vulnerable to digestion. Defects in the reactivation of heat-denatured luciferase were also evident. Correspondingly, yeast expressing P417L or P417S as the only copy of Ssa were temperature sensitive and exhibited defects in Ssa1-dependent protein translocation and misfolded protein degradation. Together, our studies suggest that the structure of the substrate binding domain is altered and that coupling between this domain and the nucleotide binding domain is disabled when the conserved P417 residue is mutated. Our data also provide new insights into the nature of the many cellular defects associated with the ssa1-45 allele.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3aadenosine triphosphate 3aadenosinetriphosphatase 3aalleles 3acatalytic activity 3aenzyme activity 3ahydrolysis 3aluciferase 3amitochondria 3amutants 3amutation 3aprotein degradation 3aprotein transport 3aproteolysis 3atemperature 3ayeasts 0aNEF 0aSBD 0aNBD 0aER 0aERAD 0aTCA 0aTLC 0aGST 0appαf 0aFP 0amolecular chaperone 0aprotein folding 0aprotein degradation 0aprotein translocation 0aERAD1 aPatel, Hardik J.1 aChiosis, Gabriela1 aThibodeau, Patrick H.1 aBrodsky, J.

However, the effects of surface physicochemical properties on the biological actions remain elusive. Herein we decorated SeNPs with various water-soluble polysaccharides extracted from various mushrooms, to compare physical characteristics and anticancer profile of these SeNPs. The results showed that the prepared spherical SeNPs displayed particle sizes at 91–102 nm, and kept stable in aqueous solution for up to 13 weeks. However, different decoration altered the tumor selectivity of the SeNPs, while gastric adenocarcinoma AGS cells showed relative highest sensitivity. Moreover, PTR-SeNPs demonstrated potent in vivo antitumor, by inducing caspases- and mitochondria-mediated apoptosis, but showed no obvious toxicity to nomal organs. Taken together, this study offers insights into how surface decoration can tune the cancer selectivity of SeNPs and provides a basis for engineering particles with increased anticancer efficacy.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadenocarcinoma 3aantineoplastic activity 3aantineoplastic agents 3aapoptosis 3aaqueous solutions 3abioavailability 3aenzymes 3amushrooms 3ananoparticles 3aparticle size 3apolysaccharides 3aselenium 3atoxicity 3awater solubility 0aselenium nanoparticles 0amushroom polysaccharide 0asurface decoration 0ain vivo anticancer efficacy1 aZhao, Jianfu1 aLuk, Kar-Him1 aCheung, Siu-To1 aWong, K.

Basic strengths of the catalysts were measured by Hammett indicators and found to be maximum in case of catalyst prepared with 5 wt% Li⁺in NiO followed by calcination at 600°C (5‐Li/NiO‐600). Catalyst characterization supported the oxidation of Ni²⁺into Ni³⁺upon lithium impregnation, which impart the enhanced ethanolysis activity to the Li/NiO catalyst. Under optimized reaction condition of 5 wt% catalyst, ethanol‐to‐oil molar ratio of 12:1 and at 65°C reaction temperature, >98% fatty acid ethyl ester yield was obtained in 3 h. The catalyst was found to be effective for the ethanolysis of vegetable oils (VO) having up to 8.3 wt% free fatty acids. During reusability experiments, Li/NiO catalyst was able to catalyze seven reaction cycles without major loss in activity. The ethanolysis of VO was found to follow pseudo first order kinetics and activation energy for the same reaction was found to be 74.2 kJ/mol. Thus, the present work has demonstrated the development of a “greener” and completely renewable biofuel, fatty acid ethyl esters, using waste cottonseed oil as feedstock. Practical applications: Due to high free fatty acid and water contents, homogenous catalysts could not be employed for the transesterification of waste cooking oils. The present study demonstrates the preparation of Li/NiO and its application as reusable solid catalyst for the ethanolysis of waste cottonseed oil to produce fatty acid ethyl esters. The prepared catalyst 5‐Li/NiO‐600 was able to show the ethanolysis of waste cottonseed oil during seven successive catalytic runs. Thus, catalyst was found to be effective for the preparation of renewable diesel fuel substitute, fatty acid ethyl esters.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3aactivation energy 3abiodiesel 3acatalysts 3acooking fats and oils 3acottonseed oil 3adiesel fuel 3aesters 3aethanol 3aethanolysis 3afatty acids 3afeedstocks 3afree fatty acids 3alithium 3amethanol 3ananoparticles 3aoxidation 3aparticle size 3asolvents 3atemperature 3atransesterification 3atransmission electron microscopy 3avegetable oil1 aAli, Amjad0 tEuropean journal of lipid science and technology.g2015 Apr., v. 117, no. 4 p.550-560dWiley-VCHx1438-76977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ejlt.2014002743Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02417naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100001500188245005500203300001800258506007600276520106800352592002801420506003701448650001201485650001501497650001601512650001701528650001201545650002101557650001701578650002001595650001301615653001501628653002001643653001701663653001501680653001301695700001801708700002001726773012301746856008101869852000901950655001201959IND60602452720221207133231.0180711e20150911xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060245272DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jmb.2015.04.0132doi7 aPMC47067382pmcid7 a259366502pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLopez, Tom14aThe Mechanism and Function of Group II Chaperonins  ap. 2919-2930.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aProtein folding in the cell requires the assistance of enzymes collectively called chaperones. Among these, the chaperonins are 1-MDa ring-shaped oligomeric complexes that bind unfolded polypeptides and promote their folding within an isolated chamber in an ATP-dependent manner. Group II chaperonins, found in archaea and eukaryotes, contain a built-in lid that opens and closes over the central chamber. In eukaryotes, the chaperonin TRiC/CCT is hetero-oligomeric, consisting of two stacked rings of eight paralogous subunits each. TRiC facilitates folding of approximately 10% of the eukaryotic proteome, including many cytoskeletal components and cell cycle regulators. Folding of many cellular substrates of TRiC cannot be assisted by any other chaperone. A complete structural and mechanistic understanding of this highly conserved and essential chaperonin remains elusive. However, recent work is beginning to shed light on key aspects of chaperonin function and how their unique properties underlie their contribution to maintaining cellular proteostasis.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aArchaea 3acell cycle 3achaperonins 3acytoskeleton 3aenzymes 3aeukaryotic cells 3apolypeptides 3aprotein folding 3aproteome 0achaperones 0aprotein folding 0aproteostasis 0achaperonin 0aTRiC/CCT1 aDalton, Kevin1 aFrydman, Judith0 tJournal of molecular biology.g2015 Sept. 11, v. 427, no. 18 p.2919-2930dElsevier LtdwJournal:12469x0022-28367nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jmb.2015.04.0133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02710naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100005600146245010700202300001800309520119400327592002801521650002201549650001101571650001901582650002001601650002001621650002301641650002601664650001901690650001001709650001201719650000901731650000801740650002901748653002501777653002201802653001801824653002301842653001801865653001201883653001601895700002001911700006001931773014801991856008002139852000902219655001202228IND60632301620221120023915.0190314e20190227xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063230162DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jafc.9b002202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJost, Tobias1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7871-134510aEfficient Analysis of 2-Acetyl-1-pyrroline in Foods Using a Novel Derivatization Strategy and LC-MS/MS  ap. 3046-3054.  a2-Acetyl-1-pyrroline (2-AP) is a key odorant in many foods, such as aromatic rice and wheat bread, with a very low odor threshold of 0.05 μg/L in water. The small molecule with a popcornlike, roasty odor is generated biologically or by Strecker degradation within the Maillard-reaction cascades during thermal food processing with methylglyoxal and 1-pyrroline as the main direct precursors. Numerous gas-chromatographic methods for the analysis of 2-AP have been published, but the reactivity of the compound leads to discrimination or degradation during sample workup. We developed a novel derivatization method for 2-AP with o-phenylenediamine followed by HPLC-MS/MS analysis of the resulting stable quinoxaline. The precision (7%), repeatability (14%), recovery (92%), linearity (0.79–500 μg/kg), limit of detection (LOD, 0.26 μg/kg), and limit of quantitation (LOQ, 0.79 μg/kg) were validated for rice matrix and were excellent as compared with those of methods published before. With the novel method, 2-AP levels in typical foods like aromatic rice (131 μg/kg), wheat bread (18 μg/kg), brown bread (18 μg/kg), rye bread (18 μg/kg), and popcorn (38 μg/kg) were determined.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMaillard reaction 3abreads 3aderivatization 3adetection limit 3afood processing 3agas chromatography 3aliquid chromatography 3aodor compounds 3aodors 3apopcorn 3arice 3arye 3atandem mass spectrometry 0a2-acetyl-1-pyrroline 0aMaillard reaction 0amethylglyoxal 0ao-phenylenediamine 0aaromatic rice 0apopcorn 0abread crust1 aHeymann, Thomas1 aGlomb, Marcus A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8826-08080 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2019 Feb. 27, v. 67, no. 10 p.3046-3054dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:12177x1520-51187nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jafc.9b002203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02611naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001800152245014300170300001600313520155300329592002801882650001101910650000901921650001301930650002501943650001401968650003201982650001402014650000902028650001102037650001102048651001302059700002302072773009002095856005502185852000902240655001202249IND4468219620221122184616.0120525e201206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446821962DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1600-0706.2011.20000.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBarnett, Adam10aSequential movement into coastal habitats and high spatial overlap of predator and prey suggest high predation pressure in protected areas  ap. 882-890.  aIn theory, predators should attempt to match the distribution of their prey, and prey to avoid areas of high predation risk. However, there is a scarcity of empirical knowledge on predator and prey spatial use when both are moving freely in their natural environment. In the current study, we use information collated on a predators’ diet, its population structure, as well as predator and prey relative abundance, and track the movements of predator and prey simultaneously to compare habitat use and evaluate predation pressure. The study was conducted in elasmobranch protected areas of coastal Tasmania, Australia. The species considered were the broadnose sevengill shark Notorynchus cepedianus, the apex predator in the area, and five chondrichthyan prey species. Notorynchus cepedianus and its prey show similar seasonality in the use of these coastal areas: more abundant in warmer months and absent in winter. Predator and prey also showed high spatial overlap and similar habitat use patterns. These similar movement patterns of predator and prey combined with the additional ecological information (diet, population structure of predator, relative abundance of predator and prey) suggests that N. cepedianus move into coastal areas to exploit seasonally abundant prey. Also, while in protected areas, chondrichthyans are subjected to high predation pressure. Overall, results illustrate the value of simultaneously recording and integrating multiple types of information to explore predator–prey relationships and predation pressure.  aPublisher supplied data 3acoasts 3adiet 3ahabitats 3apopulation structure 3apredation 3apredator-prey relationships 3apredators 3arisk 3asharks 3awinter 3aTasmania1 aSemmens, Jayson M.0 tOikos.g2012 June, v. 121, no. 6 p.882-890dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0030-12997nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1600-0706.2011.20000.x  aDNAL 7aarticle04195naa a2200877 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094024002200133024001900155040001800174100002200192245015800214300001800372506007600390520180400466592002802270506003702298650003102335650001402366650001302380650002302393650001002416650002202426650002502448650001802473650001802491650001202509650001102521650001002532650001502542650001102557650001802568650001602586650001302602650002202615650002102637650001302658653000802671653000802679653000802687653000802695653000802703653001902711653000802730653000802738653000902746653000902755653001002764653000902774653001702783653001202800653000802812653000802820653000802828653000802836653000802844653000802852653004202860653002202902653003202924653002902956653000802985653001802993653001703011653003503028653000803063653001303071653001203084700001603096773009803112856008603210852000903296655001203305IND60565759920221207104328.0190319e20170502xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056575992DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vaccine.2017.03.0672doi7 aPMC54484602pmcid7 a283856092pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGoodwin, Tyler J.10aInvestigation of phosphorylated adjuvants co-encapsulated with a model cancer peptide antigen for the treatment of colorectal cancer and liver metastasis  ap. 2550-2557.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe lipid calcium phosphate nanoparticle is a versatile platform capable of encapsulating a wide range of phosphorylated molecules from single nucleotides to pDNA. The use of this platform has shown great success as an immunotherapeutic vaccine carrier, capable of delivering co-encapsulated phosphorylated adjuvants and peptides. Three potent vaccine formulations were investigated for anti-cancer efficacy. The phosphorylated adjuvants, CpG, 2′3′cGAMP, and 5′pppdsRNA were co-encapsulated with a model phosphorylated tumor specific peptide antigen (p-AH1-A5). The anti-cancer efficacy of these adjuvants was assessed using an orthotopic colorectal liver metastasis model based on highly aggressive and metastatic CT-26 FL3 cells implanted into the cecum wall. The results clearly indicate that the RIG-1 ligand, 5′pppdsRNA, co-encapsulated with the p-AH1-A5 peptide antigen greatly reduced the growth rate of the primary colon cancer as well as arrested the establishment of liver metastasis in comparison to the other adjuvant formulations and unvaccinated controls. Further evaluation of the immune cell populations within the primary tumor confirms the ability of the 5′pppdsRNA adjuvant to boost the adaptive CD8+ T-cell population, while not inciting increased populations of immune suppressive cell types such as T-regulatory cells or myeloid derived suppressor cells. Furthermore, to our knowledge this is the first study to investigate the anti-cancer efficacy of a specific RIG-1 receptor ligand, 5′pppdsRNA, alongside more established TLR 9 (CpG) and STING (2′3′cGAMP) adjuvants in a cancer vaccine. The 5′pppdsRNA vaccine formulation can be a potent immunotherapy, especially when combined with agents that remodel the immune suppressive microenvironment of the tumor.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aCD8-positive T-lymphocytes 3aadjuvants 3aantigens 3acalcium phosphates 3acecum 3achemical elements 3acolorectal neoplasms 3aencapsulation 3aimmunotherapy 3aligands 3alipids 3aliver 3ametastasis 3amodels 3ananoparticles 3anucleotides 3apeptides 3apopulation growth 3asuppressor cells 3avaccines 0aALT 0aAST 0aBLI 0aBUN 0aCpG 0a2′3′ cGAMP 0aCRC 0aDLS 0aDAPI 0aDOPA 0aDOTAP 0aDSPE 0a5′pppdsRNA 0aELISPOT 0aLCP 0aNHS 0aPBS 0aPEG 0aRFP 0aTEM 0aLipid calcium phosphate nanoparticles 0aColorectal cancer 0aColorectal liver metastasis 0aPhosphorylated adjuvants 0aCpG 0a2′3′cGAMP 0a5′pppdsRNA 0aPhosphorylated peptide antigen 0aAH1 0ap-AH1-A5 0aVaccine1 aHuang, Leaf0 tVaccine.g2017 May 02, v. 35, no. 19 p.2550-2557dElsevier LtdwJournal:6210x0264-410X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2017.03.0673Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04088naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024003500135040001800170100002100188245015400209300001600363506007600379520213100455592002802586506003702614650002102651650001902672650001402691650001702705650001902722650001602741650001002757650001602767650001702783650001102800650000902811650001202820650001302832650000902845650001402854650001902868650001702887650003302904650001202937650004402949650004302993650001103036650006903047650007503116650006903191700002303260700002803283700002003311773009803331856004803429852000903477655001203486IND50065955220221207085135.0130509e201306  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006595522DNAL7 a228433252pmid7 aPMC36364432pmcid7 a10.1007/s12033-012-9586-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIndiveri, Cesare10aStrategies of Bacterial Over Expression of Membrane Transporters Relevant in Human Health: The Successful Case of the Three Members of OCTN Subfamily  ap. 724-736.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe OCTN subfamily includes OCTN1, 2, and 3 which are structurally and functionally related. These transporters are involved in maintenance of the carnitine homeostasis, which is essential in mammals for fatty acid β-oxidation, VLDL assembly, post-translational modifications, and other essential functions. Indeed, defects of these transporters lead to severe pathologies. OCTN1 and OCTN2 are expressed in many human tissues, while OCTN3 gene has been identified only in mouse and rat. The transporters mediate transport of carnitine and other substrates with different efficiencies and mechanisms. In order to over express the three proteins, a screening of many combinations of E. coli strains with plasmid constructs has been conducted. Only Rosetta(DE3) or Rosettagami2(DE3) gave significant expression. Higher protein amounts were firstly obtained with pET-41a(+) or pGEX-4T1 carrying fusion protein tags which required additional purification passages. Vectors carrying only a 6His tag, suitable for single passage purification, were preferred even though they lead to lower initial expression levels. Expressions were then increased optimizing several critical parameters. hOCTN1 was obtained with pH6EX3 in RosettaGami2(DE3)pLysS. hOCTN2 and mOCTN3 were obtained using pET-21a(+) in Rosetta(DE3). In particular, hOCTN2 was expressed only after codon bias, substituting the second triplet CGG with AAA (R2K mutant). The best growth conditions for hOCTN1 and mOCTN3 were 28 °C and 6 h of induction, while 4 h of induction for hOCTN2R2K. The proteins collected in the insoluble fraction of cell lysates, solubilized with sarkosyl, were purified by Ni-chelating chromatography. Final yield was 2.0, 3.0, or 3.5 mg/l of cell culture for mOCTN3, hOCTN1, or hOCTN2R2K. The data indicated that, in spite of the close evolutionary relations, several factors play different critical roles in bacterial expression of the three proteins, thus general criteria cannot be underlined. However, the strategy of dealing with related proteins revealed to be finally successful for over expressing all the three subfamily members.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aEscherichia coli 3abeta oxidation 3acarnitine 3acell culture 3achromatography 3afatty acids 3agenes 3ahomeostasis 3ahuman health 3ahumans 3amice 3amutants 3aplasmids 3arats 3ascreening 3asolubilization 3atransporters 3avery low density lipoprotein 2aAnimals 2aEscherichia colixgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aGenetic Vectorsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aHumans 2aMembrane Transport Proteinsxbiosynthesisxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aOrganic Cation Transport Proteinsxbiosynthesisxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aRecombinant Fusion Proteinsxbiosynthesisxgeneticsxmetabolism.1 aGalluccio, Michele1 aScalise, Mariafrancesca1 aPochini, Lorena0 tMolecular biotechnology.g2013 June, v. 54, no. 2 p.724-736dSpringer-Verlagx1073-60857nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12033-012-9586-8  aDNAL 7aarticle01745naa a2200253 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002100143245020600164300001600370520076600386592002801152650001401180650001501194650000901209700002501218773015001243856007701393852000901470655001201479IND60521858520221116180357.0160531e20140602xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052185852DNAL7 a10.1515/znb-1989-04172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKaukorat, Thomas10aÜber intramolekulare Donator-Akzeptor-Wechselwirkungen in N,N′-Dimethylharnstoff-Derivaten des Phosphors / Intramolecular Donor-Acceptor Interactions in N,N′-Dimethylurea Derivatives of Phosphorus  ap. 481-487.  aThe reaction of 1 with N, N′-dimethyl-N, N′-bis(trimethyIsilyl)urea, 2 has furnished the compound Me₂NCH₂CH₂N(Me)P(NMe)₂C(:O), 3.

Nine polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) with four to six rings, including pyrene (Pyr) and benzo[a]pyrene (BaP), were identified using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with fluorescence detection. Two nitropolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (NPAHs), 1-nitropyrene (1-NP) and 6-nitrobenzo[a]pyrene (6-NBaP), were identified by HPLC with chemiluminescence detection. A comparison of PAH and NPAH concentrations and [NPAH]/[PAH] ratios such as [1-NP]/[Pyr] and [6-NBaP]/[BaP] revealed the following characteristics in the five cities: (1) In Sapporo, Kanazawa, Tokyo and Sagamihara, the concentrations of PAHs and NPAHs were high at the beginning of the sampling period and then steadily decreased, with NPAHs decreasing faster than PAHs. The large initial [1-NP]/[Pyr] ratios suggest that the major contributor was automobiles but subsequent decreases in this ratio suggest decreased automobile contributions. (2) By contrast, PAH concentrations in Kitakyushu did not decrease during the sampling period, though concentrations of NPAHs decreased. The consistently smaller [1-NP]/[Pyr] ratio and larger [6-NBaP]/[BaP] ratio in Kitakyushu suggests that the major contributor of PAHs was not automobiles but iron manufacturing which uses a large amount of coal. The sudden increase in atmospheric PAH concentrations in the winter of 2014 may also be due to iron manufacturing.  aPublisher supplied data 3aautomobiles 3abenzo(a)pyrene 3achemiluminescence 3acities 3acoal 3afluorescence 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3airon 3amanufacturing 3aparticulates 3apolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons 3asummer 3awinter 3aJapan 0aPolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons 0aNitropolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons 0aJapanese urban air 0aLong term monitoring 0aAirborne particulate matter1 aTang, Ning1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3106-65341 aNagato, Edward Gou1 aToriba, Akira1 aSakai, Shigekatsu1 aKano, Fumio1 aGoto, Sumio1 aEndo, Osamu1 aArashidani, Kei-ichi1 aKakimoto, Hitoshi0 tEnvironmental pollution.g2018 Feb., v. 233 p.474-482dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl41014x0269-74917nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2017.10.0383Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02536naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100001700142245007500159300001600234520136900250592002801619650003001647650001201677650001901689650002701708650001101735650001101746650001601757651001101773653001801784653001601802653001101818653001901829653002201848700001601870700002101886773014601907856007602053852000902129655001202138IND60594864020221120180300.0180524e201805  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059486402DNAL7 a10.1660/062.121.02182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDye, Caitlin10aTemporal and Spatial Variation in Precipitation Seasonality for Kansas  ap. 153-159.  aA considerable amount of research work on climate change is being done to examine what has happened in the recorded past and what might happen throughout the remainder of the 21st Century. While the data for trends in the temperature record tend to be more straightforward, what has and will happen with precipitation change is less clear. However, there is the suggestion that wet places will get wetter and dry places with become more arid. Research by others suggests that extreme daily precipitation amounts in Kansas are trending upward. This research addresses the observational record of change in precipitation seasonality, a little-studied aspect of global climate variability and the related impact on moisture delivery. Monthly precipitation data were summed to provide seasonal totals and seasonal percentages of the annual total were calculated. Using data for the nine Climate Divisions within Kansas for the period from 1895–2014, the results from this analysis indicate that much of Kansas has a winter-dry climate. Over the period of record, there has been a tendency for the spring months of March, April, and May to gain a greater share of the annual total. Geographic variation across the state indicates a west-to-east gradient with greater seasonality in the west and a greater increase in spring and summer precipitation in eastern Kansas.  aPublisher supplied data 3aatmospheric precipitation 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3ageographical variation 3aspring 3asummer 3atemperature 3aKansas 0aprecipitation 0aseasonality 0aKansas 0aclimate change 0aspatial variation1 aHoward, Ian1 aHarrington, John0 tTransactions of the Kansas Academy of Science.g2018 May, v. 121, no. 1-2 p.153-159dKansas Academy of SciencewJournal:6278x0022-84437nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1660/062.121.02183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02814naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002100151245017400172300001600346520123300362592002801595650004401623650001401667650002101681650001401702650001301716650001001729650001701739650001801756650001201774650002001786650001801806650001301824650000701837650001701844650003301861650001101894650001101905650002301916650003701939653002301976653003601999653003102035653001802066653002102084773010802105856008602213852000902299655001202308IND60525346320221123004625.0190318e20160801xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052534632DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbpol.2016.03.0372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYilmaz, M.

Polyelectrolyte multilayer coated mesoporous silica nanoparticles (PEM-MSNPs) were characterized by using attenuated total reflection–fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (ATR–FTIR), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms, UV–vis and fluorescence spectrophotometer. A commercially available and industrially used optical brightener, 4,4′-distyrylbiphenyl sulfonate sodium salt (CBSX) was loaded into nanocontainers (CBSX@PEM-MSNPs) to evaluate their use for the pH-sensitive release. The controlled release of CBSX from nanocontainers in response to pH is monitored by using UV–vis and fluorescence spectrophotometer in water and the almost 100% of encapsulated CBSX is released within 2h at pH 7. The increase in both whiteness and total color change at pH 7 on a cellulose fabric demonstrates the great potential of nanocontainers as pH-sensitive whitening agents for optical bleaching of cellulose fabrics.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3ableaching 3ableaching agents 3acellulose 3achitosan 3acolor 3aelectrolytes 3aencapsulation 3afabrics 3ahyaluronic acid 3ananoparticles 3anitrogen 3apH 3aporous media 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asilica 3asodium 3aspectrophotometers 3atransmission electron microscopy 0aOptical brightener 0aMesoporous silica nanoparticles 0aPolyelectrolyte multilayer 0apH responsive 0aCellulose fabric0 tCarbohydrate polymers.g2016 Aug. 01, v. 146 p.174-180dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl47819x0144-86177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbpol.2016.03.0373Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03671naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245014800165300001400313500001500327520212600342592002802468650002502496650001502521650001302536650001102549650001302560650000902573650001202582650001502594650001602609650001902625650001202644650001902656650001102675650001102686650001902697650001902716650001002735650001602745650001102761650002502772650001602797650001102813650001902824651001702843651002502860653001502885653001002900700002102910700001702931773008802948856004803036852000903084655001203093IND50064847120221119163156.0130410e201303  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006484712DNAL7 a10.1007/s11540-013-9229-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFranke, A.

Assessing Risks and Opportunities of Adaptation Strategies  ap. 51-66.  a2019-12-06  aThis study aims to assess the risks and opportunities posed by climate change to potato growers in South Africa and to evaluate adaptation measures in the form of changes in planting time growers could adopt to optimise land and water use efficiencies in potato, using a climate model of past, present-day and future climate over southern Africa and the LINTUL crop growth model. This was done for distinct agro-ecosystems in South Africa: the southern Mediterranean area where potato still is grown year round with a doubling of the number of hot days between 1960 and 2050, the Eastern Free State with summer crops only and Limpopo with currently autumn, winter and spring crops where the number of hot days increases sevenfold and in future the crop will mainly be grown in winter. A benefit here will be a drastic reduction of frost days from 0.9 days per winter to 0. Potato crops in the agro-ecosystems will benefit considerably from increased CO₂ levels such as increased tuber yield and reduced water use by the crop, if planting is shifted to appropriate times of the year. When the crop is grown in hot periods, however, these benefits are counteracted by an increased incidence of heat stress and increased evapotranspiration, leading in some instances to considerably lower yields and water use efficiencies. Therefore year-round total production at the Sandveld stabilizes at around 140 Mg ha⁻¹ (yield reduction in summer and yield increase in winter), increases by about 30% in the Free State and stays at about 95 t ha⁻¹ at Limpopo where yield increase due to CO₂ is annulled by a shorter growing season. When the crop is grown in a cool period, there is an additional benefit of a reduced incidence of cold stress and a more rapid canopy development in the early stages of crop growth. In all three areas, potato growers are likely to respond to climate change by advancing planting. In Limpopo, a major benefit of climate change is a reduction in the risk of frost damage in winter. The relevance of these findings for potato grown in agro-ecosystems elsewhere in the world is discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3adevelopmental stages 3acrop yield 3apotatoes 3asummer 3aland use 3arisk 3agrowers 3airrigation 3aheat stress 3aclimate models 3aclimate 3aagroecosystems 3awinter 3aautumn 3aclimate change 3arisk reduction 3afrost 3acrop models 3acanopy 3awater use efficiency 3acold stress 3aspring 3agrowing season 3aSouth Africa 3aMediterranean region 0aadaptation 0acrops1 aHaverkort, A.

A transgenic mouse overexpressing calsequestrin can be regarded as an animal model of heart failure. The aims of the present study were to investigate, whether at the time of cardiac failure the composition of fiber types of skeletal muscles was altered, what kind of alterations in glycolytic and oxidative enzyme activities occurred in different muscle fiber types and whether these were affected by the administration of the angiotensin II receptor blocker, losartan. Hemodynamic parameters were determined using a working heart preparation. Four groups of mice were investigated: wild-type (WT) mice and transgenic (TG) mice overexpressing calsequestrin, with and without losartan treatment. Enzyme activities were measured in homogenates of Rectus femoris muscle and in muscle fibers, which were typed by their metabolic profile. Calcineurin expression was measured by Western blotting. Succinate dehydrogenase activity was increased by 275% in R. femoris muscle homogenates of TG compared to WT mice. This was due to a 57% increase in slow oxidative fibers, which was accompanied by an increased calcineurin expression in TG muscles. This increase was attenuated by losartan treatment. With respect to glycerol-3-phosphate-dehydrogenase (GPDH), no difference was evident comparing WT and TG. Treatment with losartan resulted in a down-regulation of GPDH in WT and TG. In conclusion, changes in skeletal muscles occur in this mouse model of heart failure and these changes were antagonized by losartan. In contrast to heart failure patients, in the mouse model a shift to the oxidative phenotype of skeletal muscle was noted, possibly due to enhanced calcineurin expression.  aPublisher supplied data 3aphenotype 3agene overexpression 3aheart failure 3amuscles 3aglycolysis 3askeletal muscle 3atransgenic animals 3aWestern blotting 3amice 3asuccinate dehydrogenase (quinone) 3aheart 3aanimal models 3apatients 3aglycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase 3amuscle fibers 3aenzyme activity 3aangiotensin II 0asuccinate dehydrogenase1 aKusche, Tina1 aGünther, Sophie1 aAdams, Volker1 aJones, L.

However, comprehensive profiling of the organic acid sub-metabolome is a major analytical challenge. In this work, we report an improved method for detecting organic acid metabolites. This method is based on the use of liquid–liquid extraction (LLE) to selectively extract the organic acids, followed by using differential isotope p-dimethylaminophenacyl (DmPA) labeling of the acid metabolites. The 12C-/13C-labeled samples are analyzed by liquid chromatography Fourier-transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (LC–FTICR–MS). It is shown that this LLE DmPA labeling method offers superior performance over the method of direct DmPA labeling of biofluids such as human urine. LLE of organic acids reduces the interference of amine-containing metabolites that may also react with DmPA. It can also remove water in a biofluid that can reduce the labeling efficiency. Using human urine as an example, it is demonstrated that about 2500 peak pairs or putative metabolites could be detected in a 30-min gradient LC–MS run, which is about 3 times more than that detected in a sample prepared using direct DmPA labeling. About 95% of the 1000 or so matched metabolites to the Human Metabolome Database (HMDB) are organic acids. It is further shown that this method can be used to handle as small as 10μL of urine. We believe that this method opens the possibility of generating a very comprehensive profile of the organic acid sub-metabolome that will be useful for comparative metabolomics applications for biological studies and disease biomarker discovery.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiomarkers 3adatabases 3ahumans 3aisotopes 3aliquid chromatography 3aliquid-liquid extraction 3amass spectrometry 3ametabolites 3ametabolome 3ametabolomics 3aorganic acids and salts 3aurine 0aMass spectrometry 0aLiquid chromatography 0aIsotope labeling 0ap-Dimethylaminophenacyl bromide 0aAcid-containing metabolites 0aMetabolomics1 aLi, Liang0 tAnalytica chimica acta.g2013 Nov. 25, v. 803 p.97-105dElsevier B.V.x0003-26707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aca.2013.07.0453Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02281naa a2200301 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003100092040001800123100002100141245011000162300001400272520132400286592002801610650001201638650002601650650001401676650001801690650001201708650001501720650002001735650002301755773009901778856008101877852000901958655001201967IND4473314220221118095816.0120423e201201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447331422DNAL7 a10.1093/beheco/arr1442doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDavis, Alison R.10aKin presence drives philopatry and social aggregation in juvenile Desert Night Lizards (Xantusia vigilis)  ap. 18-24.  aKin selection is a powerful concept in evolutionary biology that can explain both cooperative and competitive behavior. Most social behavior associated with kin selection depends on prior dispersal decisions by juveniles, which can choose to either disperse away from kin or remain at the natal site. A useful way to investigate the role of kin in social behavior is to experimentally manipulate kin environment and resolve a direct causal relationship between kin presence, dispersal strategy, and subsequent social behavior. I used a cross-fostering experiment to manipulate the relatedness of the social environment in both the laboratory and the field and test for the effects of kin on juvenile dispersal and social aggregation in the Desert Night Lizard (Xantusia vigilis). I found that kin presence actively promotes both philopatry and winter aggregation, which is consistent with the predictions of kin cooperation and suggests that kin sociality in this species is not simply a by-product of limited dispersal. In combination with kin effects known in other species, these results suggest a generality of positive associations with kin, the potential dominance of cooperative over competitive mechanisms, and the increased prominence that cooperation may have in the future theoretical study of kin selection.  aPublisher supplied data 3adeserts 3afield experimentation 3ajuveniles 3akin selection 3alizards 3aphilopatry 3asocial behavior 3asocial environment0 tBehavioral ecology.g2012 Jan., v. 23, no. 1 p.18-24dOxford University Pressx1045-22497nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/beheco/arr1443Available from publisher's Web site  aDNAL 7aarticle03046naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002300151245014600174300001600320520155900336536009801895592002801993596003202021650002002053650001402073650001202087650001402099650001602113650001502129650002002144650001102164650002302175650001202198653001002210653001002220653001702230653002602247653001102273653001402284653001502298700002602313700002102339773012202360856008502482852000902567655001202576IND60742117620221118025240.0210623e20210504xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074211762DNAL7 a10.1080/03949370.2021.18719662doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBingman, Verner P.10aAvian forebrain processing of magnetic intensity and inclination: hippocampus, anterior forebrain Wulst and an unexpected double-dissociation  ap. 230-247.  aIt is often neglected that the ability of birds to extract navigational information from the earth’s magnetic field can be shaped by learning and memory, which would necessarily recruit brain regions of the telencephalon that support cognitive processes. In the current study, we exploited a validated, conditioning experimental paradigm to explore the possible role of the homing pigeon hippocampal formation (HF) and anterior forebrain Wulst in the detection of variation in both magnetic field intensity and inclination. Whereas HF lesions resulted in a complete loss of intensity discrimination while sparing inclination discrimination, Wulst lesions had the opposite effect, resulting in a complete loss of inclination discrimination while sparing intensity discrimination. It is not surprising that Wulst lesions should disrupt inclination discrimination because in migratory songbirds, regions of the Wulst are known to support the geomagnetic compass, which relies on inclination. More challenging is explaining why HF should be sensitive to variation in magnetic intensity. We suggest that the observed HF sensitivity to intensity may reflect incorporation of geomagnetic irregularities (anomalies) as pigeons learn a map-like representation of familiar landmarks and landscape features. The parallel processing of magnetic intensity and inclination in the homing pigeon forebrain sets the foundation for future studies designed to better understand how cognitive processing can influence geomagnetically guided navigational behavior in birds.  aThis work was supported by the National Science Foundation USA [IOS-0922508 and IOS-1457304].  aPublisher supplied data  aIOS-0922508 and IOS-1457304 3aanimal behavior 3acognition 3aecology 3aevolution 3ahippocampus 3alandscapes 3amagnetic fields 3amemory 3amigratory behavior 3apigeons 0abirds 0abrain 0ageomagnetism 0ahippocampal formation 0ahoming 0amigration 0anavigation1 aPemberton, Merissa L.1 aMora, Cordula V.0 tEthology, ecology & evolution.g2021 May 04, v. 33, no. 3 p.230-247dTaylor & FranciswJournal:12280x1828-71317nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/03949370.2021.18719663Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02322naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006400148245012100212300001600333520112600349592002801475650002001503650001101523650002901534653003801563653000801601653003001609653001401639653001901653653001001672700002401682700002201706700002101728773012001749856008201869852000901951655001201960IND60599949620221118160042.0180702e201411  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059994962DNAL7 a10.1016/j.csda.2014.06.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aO’Brien, Travis A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6643-117510aReducing the computational cost of the ECF using a nuFFT: A fast and objective probability density estimation method  ap. 222-234.  aA nonuniform, fast Fourier transform can be used to reduce the computational cost of the empirical characteristic function (ECF) by a factor of 100. This fast ECF calculation method is applied to a new, objective, and robust method for estimating the probability distribution of univariate data, which effectively modulates and filters the ECF of a dataset in a way that yields an optimal estimate of the (Fourier transformed) underlying distribution. This improvement in computational efficiency is leveraged to estimate probability densities from a large ensemble of atmospheric velocity increments (gradients), with the purpose of characterizing the statistical and fractal properties of the velocity field. It is shown that the distribution of velocity increments depends on location in an atmospheric model and that the increments are clearly not normally distributed. The estimated increment distributions exhibit self-similar and distinctly multifractal behavior, as shown by structure functions that exhibit power-law scaling with a non-linear dependence of the power-law exponent on the structure function order.  aPublisher supplied data 3adata collection 3amodels 3aprobability distribution 0aEmpirical characteristic function 0aECF 0aKernel density estimation 0aHistogram 0aNonuniform FFT 0anuFFT1 aCollins, William D.1 aRauscher, Sara A.1 aRingler, Todd D.0 tComputational statistics & data analysis.g2014 Nov., v. 79 p.222-234dElsevier B.V.wJournal:3109x0167-94737nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.csda.2014.06.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02054naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002000148245008400168300001400252520078100266592002801047650002001075650002701095650001401122650001201136650002001148650001101168650001601179650001201195653001401207653001901221653002301240653002101263653002901284653003801313653002801351653002301379700002101402773011801423856008201541852000901623655001201632IND60599949820221118160011.0180702e201412  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059994982DNAL7 a10.1016/j.csda.2014.06.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHorrocks, Julie12aA Bayesian approach to estimating animal density from binary acoustic transects  ap. 17-25.  aA Bayesian model is proposed for estimating abundance or density of animals from passive acoustic binary data. The data are collected at points along one or more transects, and the points are spaced so that a single individual can be heard multiple times. Thus successive data points are dependent and this dependence is exploited to simultaneously estimate density, range of detection and probability of detection. The data are assumed to follow a homogeneous Poisson process. The Bayesian model combines a prior distribution for the model parameters, with a second-order Markov approximation to the likelihood. Sensitivity of the model to choice of priors is investigated. The method is illustrated using acoustic data from a survey of sperm whales (Physeter macrocephalus).  aPublisher supplied data 3aBayesian theory 3aPhyseter macrocephalus 3aacoustics 3aanimals 3adetection limit 3amodels 3aprobability 3asurveys 0aAbundance 0aAnimal density 0aBinary time series 0aBayesian methods 0aPassive acoustic surveys 0aSecond-order Markov approximation 0aSpatial Poisson process 0aMultiple transects1 aRueffer, Matthew0 tComputational statistics & data analysis.g2014 Dec., v. 80 p.17-25dElsevier B.V.wJournal:3109x0167-94737nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.csda.2014.06.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03122naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004300111040001800154100001700172245007100189300001600260500001500276520167200291592002801963650001001991650001502001650002002016650001102036650001602047650001502063650001502078650001402093650002502107650001502132650001502147650005502162650004702217650004502264650005702309650002602366651001802392651001802410653001602428700001502444773008302459856008902542852000902631655001202640IND4466442720221118095332.0141110e201108  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446644272DNAL7 a213333202pmid7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2011.01.0512doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSuh, Sangwon10aPhosphorus use-efficiency of agriculture and food system in the US  ap. 806-813.  a2019-12-06  aThe rapid increase in human mobilization of phosphorus has raised concerns on both its supply security and its impact on the environment. Increasing the efficiency of phosphorus use is an approach to mitigate the adverse impacts associated with phosphorus consumption. This study estimates the life-cycle phosphorus use-efficiency of the US food system. A framework for accounting phosphorus stocks and flows is developed, and the account was populated with data. A map of phosphorus stocks and flows around the US food system is drawn and phosphorus use-efficiency was calculated. The results show that only 15% of the total phosphorus extracted from nature for the provision of food is eventually ingested by humans and the rest is lost to the environment. Major losses occur during the livestock, meat and dairy production and crop cultivation stage, where about 66% of the total phosphorus extracted is lost to the environment. The results also show that other losses of phosphorus including household food waste, mining waste, and fertilizer manufacturing waste are not negligible, which constitute about 19% of the total phosphorus extracted for food purpose. A data quality assessment and sensitivity analysis was performed to identify data quality hotspots and to envisage effective measures to improving phosphorus use-efficiency. Improving yields of livestock and crop cultivation without additional phosphorus input and reducing household food waste are shown to be effective measures to improve life-cycle phosphorus use-efficiency. The results highlight the need of a concerted effort by all entities along the life-cycle for efficient use of phosphorus.  aPublisher supplied data 3afoods 3ahouseholds 3ameat production 3ahumans 3afertilizers 3aaccounting 3acrop yield 3alivestock 3aenvironmental impact 3aphosphorus 3afood waste 2aAgriculturexmethodsxstatistics & numerical data. 2aConservation of Natural Resourcesxmethods 2aFertilizersxstatistics & numerical data 2aFood Industryxmethodsxstatistics & numerical data. 2aPhosphorusxchemistry 3aUnited States 0aUnited States 0afood wastes1 aYee, Scott0 tChemosphere.g2011 Aug., v. 84, no. 6 p.806-813dElsevier Ltdx0045-65357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2011.01.0513Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02654naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245009700164300001600261500001500277520126300292592002801555650000901583650001301592650001601605650001301621650001101634650001501645650001301660650001601673650001801689650001501707650002301722653002301745653001901768653000901787653001801796700001801814700002601832700001601858700002601874700001201900700001501912700002101927700001801948773009201966856008102058852000902139655001202148IND60085876320221118093241.0160901e20131125xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008587632DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aca.2013.09.0362doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWeng, Ziqing10aSelf-assembly of core-satellite gold nanoparticles for colorimetric detection of copper ions  ap. 128-134.  a2019-12-06  aMolecule-coated nanoparticles are hybrid materials which can be engineered with novel properties. The molecular coating of metal nanoparticles can provide chemical functionality, enabling assembly of the nanoparticles that are important for applications, such as biosensing devices. Herein, we report a new self-assembly of core-satellite gold nanoparticles linked by a simple amino acid l-Cysteine for biosensing of Cu2+. The plasmonic properties of core-satellite nano-assemblies were investigated, a new red shifted absorbance peak from about 600 to 800nm was found, with specific wavelength depending on ratios with assembly of large and small gold nanoparticles. The spectral features obtained using surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) provided strong evidence for the assembly of the Cu2+ ions to the L-Cysteine molecules leading to the successful formation of the core-satellite Cu(l-Cysteine) complex on the gold surfaces. In addition, a linear relationship between the concentration of mediating Cu2+ and absorbance of self-assembled gold nanoparticles (GNPs) at 680nm was obtained. These results strongly address the potential strategy for applying the functionalized GNPs as novel biosensing tools in trace detections of certain metal ions.  aPublisher supplied data 3agold 3ananogold 3acolorimetry 3acoatings 3acopper 3aabsorbance 3acysteine 3awavelengths 3ananoparticles 3ametal ions 3aRaman spectroscopy 0aGold nanoparticles 0aCore-satellite 0aions 0aSelf-assembly1 aWang, Hongbin1 aVongsvivut, Jitraporn1 aLi, Runqing1 aGlushenkov, Alexey M.1 aHe, Jin1 aChen, Ying1 aBarrow, Colin J.1 aYang, Wenrong0 tAnalytica chimica acta.g2013 Nov. 25, v. 803 p.128-134dElsevier B.V.x0003-26707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aca.2013.09.0363Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02699naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002600152245011900178300001600297520155900313592002801872650001601900650001501916650001101931650001101942653001901953653002501972653002101997653001802018653002002036653001902056700002202075700001902097700001502116773009802131856008702229852000902316655001202325IND60644217020221117213719.0191214e20190801xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064421702DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apenergy.2019.04.0452doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSingh, Awanish Pratap10aSpatio-temporal effect of the breakdown zone in the laser-initiated ignition of atomized ethyl alcohol-air mixture  ap. 140-154.  aLaser initiated ignition would play a vital role in future gas turbine combustors. Two lasers of 270 μJ and 50 mJ pulse energy are used to study the laser-induced spark ignition of atomized ethyl alcohol-air mixture. With the low-energy pulse of 270 μJ energy, no display of ignition is observed even though it fulfills the threshold conditions to create breakdown. However, with the high-energy pulse of 50 mJ energy, ignition is observed if the plasma kernel was following certain conditions after the occurrence of the breakdown. It is observed that breakdown created by the low-energy pulse was unable to ignite the atomized ethanol-air mixture because the lifetime of the plasma kernel was very small (in microseconds). While performing the study with high-energy pulse, it is observed that the breakdown becomes a sufficient condition for ignition only when the lifetime of the kernel is couple of milliseconds. Additionally, the spatial location of the laser spark is found to play a vital role in successful ignition of the mixture. This work also discusses the spray formation process with its effect on ignition and the role of the third lobe on rapid development of the plasma kernel. The process of laser energy deposition to full scale combustion is categorized into three events. Finally, based on the experimental observations, this work has proposed some favourable conditions for initiating ignition with a laser spark. Knowledge of the proposed conditions can play a vital role for designing a practical laser ignition system.  aPublisher supplied data 3aatomization 3acombustion 3aenergy 3alasers 0aLaser ignition 0aLaser-induced plasma 0aIgnition process 0aPlasma kernel 0aKernel lifetime 0aSpray ignition1 aPadhi, Upasana P.1 aJoarder, Ratan1 aRoy, Arnab0 tApplied energy.g2019 Aug. 01, v. 247 p.140-154dElsevier LtdwJournal:11876x0306-26197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2019.04.0453Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02551naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004000092040001800132100001800150245010300168300001600271500001500287520130900302592002801611650001501639650001101654650002101665650002401686650001301710650002301723650001901746650002001765650001501785650002501800650001701825650002001842650002001862651001001882653001101892700001701903700001701920773008501937856008602022852000902108655001202117IND4475693020221118100219.0141111e20111030xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447569302DNAL7 a10.1016/j.geoderma.2011.07.0282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Xiaodan10aEffects of gravel on grassland soil carbon and nitrogen in the arid regions of the Tibetan Plateau  ap. 181-188.  a2019-12-06  aMany previous studies have focused on soil gravel concentrations and their effect on crop yields in agricultural systems. The extent of carbon and nitrogen sequestration in soils under steppe systems in relation to surface gravel mulch remains largely unexplored. This study investigated the effects of gravel mulches on soil organic carbon and total nitrogen stocks in the arid and windy regions of the Tibetan Plateau. Surface gravel mulches provide a more favorable environment for soil carbon and nitrogen stocks than do non-mulched sites. Soil organic carbon and total nitrogen stocks were highest (46.9Mgha⁻¹ SOC and 2.8Mgha⁻¹ TN) in the medium gravel mulch sites with ~40–50% gravel, and lowest (29.5Mgha⁻¹ SOC and 1.4Mgha⁻¹ TN) in no gravel mulch sites. Analysis of aggregate size fractions indicated that the vast majority of SOC was present in microaggregate fractions throughout the top 30cm of soil. Considering the low level of soil disturbance in the study area, the carbon contained in the macroaggregate fraction might become stabilized in the soil. Gravel mulches above the soil surface have an important bearing on soil carbon sequestration as they control wind erosion, decrease soil surface evaporation and change soil physical behavior in the arid and semiarid regions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aarid zones 3agravel 3anitrogen content 3asoil organic carbon 3anitrogen 3asoil stabilization 3asemiarid zones 3aedaphic factors 3acrop yield 3acarbon sequestration 3awind erosion 3adisturbed soils 3agrassland soils 3aChina 0acarbon1 aLiu, Gangcai1 aLiu, Shuzhen0 tGeoderma.g2011 Oct. 30, v. 166, no. 1 p.181-188dElsevier B.V.x0016-70617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.geoderma.2011.07.0283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03790naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245008600165300001600251520219100267592002802458650001802486650003202504650001502536650001302551650001402564650001002578650002202588650002002610650002602630650001302656650001402669650002502683650001602708650001302724650001902737650001202756653003202768653002602800653002102826653002202847653002502869700002402894700002502918700002502943700002802968700002102996700002203017773011703039856008303156852000903239655001203248IND60125138920221121012851.0151102e201209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012513892DNAL7 a10.1637/9982-110811-Reg.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aToro, Haroldo10aInfectious Bronchitis Virus Subpopulations in Vaccinated Chickens After Challenge  ap. 501-508.  aInfectious bronchitis coronavirus (IBV) shows extensive genotypic and phenotypic variability. The evolutionary process involves generation of genetic diversity by mutations and recombination followed by replication of those phenotypes favored by selection. In the current study, we examined changes occurring in a wild Arkansas (Ark) challenge strain in chickens that were vaccinated either ocularly with commercially available attenuated ArkDPI-derived vaccines or in ovo with a replication–defective recombinant adenovirus expressing a codon-optimized IBV Ark S1 gene (AdArkIBV.S1cₖ). Commercial IBV Ark vaccines A, B, and C provided slightly differing levels of protection against homologous challenge. Most importantly for the current study, chickens vaccinated with the different vaccines displayed significant differences in specific B-lymphocyte responses in the Harderian gland (i.e., the challenge virus encountered differing immune selective pressure during invasion among host groups). Based on S1 sequences, five predominant populations were found in different individual vaccinated/challenged chickens. Chickens with the strongest immune response (vaccine A) were able to successfully impede replication of the challenge virus in most chickens, and only the population predominant in the challenge strain was detected in a few IBV-positive birds. In contrast, in chickens showing less than optimal specific immune responses (vaccines B and C) IBV was detected in most chickens, and populations different from the predominant one in the challenge strain were selected and became predominant. These results provide scientific evidence for the assumption that poor vaccination contributes to the emergence of new IBV strains via mutation and/or selection. In ovo vaccination with a low dose of AdArkIBV.S1cₖ resulted in a mild increase of systemic antibody and reduced viral shedding but no protection against IBV signs and lesions. Under these conditions we detected only virus populations identical to the challenge virus. Possible explanations are discussed. From a broad perspective, these results indicate that selection is an important force driving IBV evolution.  aPublisher supplied data 3aB-lymphocytes 3aInfectious bronchitis virus 3aantibodies 3achickens 3aevolution 3agenes 3agenetic variation 3aimmune response 3ainfectious bronchitis 3amutation 3aphenotype 3aphenotypic variation 3avaccination 3avaccines 3aviral shedding 3aviruses 0ainfectious bronchitis virus 0acoronavirus evolution 0aimmune selection 0agenetic diversity 0aphenotypic variation1 aPennington, Daniela1 aGallardo, Rodrigo A.1 avan Santen, Vicky L.1 avan Ginkel, Frederik W.1 aZhang, Jianfeng,1 aJoiner, Kellye S.0 tAvian diseases.g2012 Sept., v. 56, no. 3 p.501-508dAmerican Association of Avian Pathologistsx1938-43517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1637%2F9982-110811-Reg.13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03146naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002100149245006600170300001600236520175700252592002802009650002102037650000902058650001202067650002002079650001702099650001802116650001102134650002302145650002002168650001902188650001502207650001502222650001502237653001602252653002402268653002202292653001502314653002802329653002402357700001802381700002202399700002002421773013002441856008402571852000902655655001202664IND50067824220221120214500.0190412e201307  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006782422DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ifset.2013.04.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSurowsky, Bjoern10aCold plasma effects on enzyme activity in a model food system  ap. 146-152.  aPolyphenoloxidase (PPO) and peroxidase (POD) are enzymes that need to be inactivated or inhibited in order to avoid undesirable browning reactions and the loss of sensorial or nutritional quality of fruits and vegetables. As a promising “gentle” alternative to traditional methods, such as pasteurisation or the use of antibrowning compounds, the present study investigates cold plasma's ability to inactivate PPO and POD in a model food system, as well as possible inactivation mechanisms.The study shows that cold plasma is capable of reducing the activity of both PPO and POD in the model food system. The activity of PPO was reduced by about 90% after a treatment time of 180s. POD was more stable and was reduced by about 85% after 240s. Circular dichroism and tryptophan fluorescence measurements indicate that the reason for their loss of activity is based on a plasma-induced modification of their secondary structure. A decrease in the alpha-helix content was accompanied by an increase of the percentage of beta-sheet regions. Reduced and red-shifted tryptophan fluorescence intensities supported these changes.The quality of freshly cut fruits and vegetables greatly depends on the activity of naturally occurring enzymes such as PPO and POD, which catalyse browning reactions at cut surfaces. The presented study shows that cold plasma, as a promising non-thermal pasteurisation technology, is capable of reducing the activity of these enzymes in a model food system. In addition, it describes the impact of different treatment parameters and gives insights into inactivation mechanisms. The results contribute to the understanding of cold plasma effects on enzyme activity and could be a basis for a possible industrial implementation.  aPublisher supplied data 3acatechol oxidase 3acold 3acutting 3aenzyme activity 3afluorescence 3afruit quality 3afruits 3amodel food systems 3anutritive value 3apasteurization 3aperoxidase 3atryptophan 3avegetables 0aCold plasma 0aNon-thermal process 0aPolyphenoloxidase 0aPeroxidase 0aTryptophan fluorescence 0aSecondary structure1 aFischer, Axel1 aSchlueter, Oliver1 aKnorr, Dietrich0 tInnovative food science & emerging technologies.g2013 July, v. 19 p.146-152dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl69720x1466-85647nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ifset.2013.04.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02974naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002200139245015300161300001600314500002000330500001500350520150200365592002801867650001301895650001501908650001401923650002101937650002201958650002001980650001602000650002502016650001402041650002002055650002202075650002302097650001302120650001302133650001102146650001002157650001202167650001502179653001002194700001902204700001802223700001902241700002002260773009402280856007302374852000902447655001202456IND60523295520221121122619.0160610e201605  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052329552DNAL7 a10.1111/tpj.131702doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSeibt, Kathrin M.10aShort interspersed nuclear elements (SINEs) are abundant in Solanaceae and have a family‐specific impact on gene structure and genome organization  ap. 268-285.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  a2019-12-06  aShort interspersed nuclear elements (SINEs) are highly abundant non‐autonomous retrotransposons that are widespread in plants. They are short in size, non‐coding, show high sequence diversity, and are therefore mostly not or not correctly annotated in plant genome sequences. Hence, comparative studies on genomic SINE populations are rare. To explore the structural organization and impact of SINEs, we comparatively investigated the genome sequences of the Solanaceae species potato (Solanum tuberosum), tomato (Solanum lycopersicum), wild tomato (Solanum pennellii), and two pepper cultivars (Capsicum annuum). Based on 8.5 Gbp sequence data, we annotated 82 983 SINE copies belonging to 10 families and subfamilies on a base pair level. Solanaceae SINEs are dispersed over all chromosomes with enrichments in distal regions. Depending on the genome assemblies and gene predictions, 30% of all SINE copies are associated with genes, particularly frequent in introns and untranslated regions (UTRs). The close association with genes is family specific. More than 10% of all genes annotated in the Solanaceae species investigated contain at least one SINE insertion, and we found genes harbouring up to 16 SINE copies. We demonstrate the involvement of SINEs in gene and genome evolution including the donation of splice sites, start and stop codons and exons to genes, enlargement of introns and UTRs, generation of tandem‐like duplications and transduction of adjacent sequence regions.  aPublisher supplied data 3atomatoes 3astop codon 3acultivars 3aretrotransposons 3aSolanum pennellii 3aCapsicum annuum 3achromosomes 3aSolanum lycopersicum 3aevolution 3agenome assembly 3aSolanum tuberosum 3asequence diversity 3apotatoes 3agenomics 3apepper 3aexons 3aintrons 3aprediction 0agenes1 aWenke, Torsten1 aMuders, Katja1 aTruberg, Bernd1 aSchmidt, Thomas0 tplant journal.g2016 May, v. 86, no. 3 p.268-285dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltdx0960-74127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/tpj.131703Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03335naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005100148245009300199300001600292500001900308520184300327592002802170596005902198650002602257650002402283650001502307650001002322650004302332650001802375650002402393650001202417650001502429650002202444650001902466650002102485650001502506651001002521700001802531700001502549700002302564700001502587700001202602700002002614773012802634856008202762852000902844655001202853IND60731627820221119044010.0210321e202103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073162782DNAL7 a10.1007/s11104-020-04823-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRen, Ze1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1473-269710aSoil bacterial communities vary with grassland degradation in the Qinghai Lake watershed  ap. 541-557.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aAIMS: Grasslands are experiencing severe degradation globally, impacting aboveground vegetation and soil properties. The influences of grassland degradation on bacterial communities in soil are not well-understood. METHODS: The normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) was calculated to represent grassland status and indicate grassland degradation (decreasing NDVI). Soil ph, bacterial communities, as well as nutrient and organic carbon concentrations were measured. RESULTS: Bacterial alpha diversity had negative relationships with soil moisture, soil organic carbon (SOC), total nitrogen (TN), and total phosphorus (TP). Bacterial community structure was significantly associated with NDVI, the change rate of NDVI, moisture, ph, SOC, TN, as well as soil C:N and C:P ratios. Bacterial phyla were differentially related with these environmental variables. Moreover, network analysis showed that the network of soil bacteria had strong cooperation relationships (positive correlations between taxa) and was grouped into three modules. According to modularity, 71 keystone taxa were detected as network connectors and module hubs. All the modules had close relationships with environmental variables, and many keystone taxa were negatively associated with soil moisture and SOC. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that grassland degradation might be responsible for shifts in soil bacterial communities in terms of alpha diversity and community structure through changes in soil moisture, SOC, nutrients, and C:nutrient ratios. Moreover, in the network analyses, the strong co-occurrence relationships between taxa as well as close relationships between environmental variables and module structures and keystone taxa suggest low stability and high vulnerability of bacterial communities to the influences of grassland degradation.  aPublisher supplied data  a41671106cNational Natural Science Foundation of China 3abacterial communities 3acommunity structure 3agrasslands 3alakes 3anormalized difference vegetation index 3asoil bacteria 3asoil organic carbon 3asoil pH 3asoil water 3aspecies diversity 3atotal nitrogen 3atotal phosphorus 3awatersheds 3aChina1 aWang, Zhaomin1 aWang, Ying1 aTianyahudielangzi,1 aNiu, Decao1 aFu, Hua1 aElser, James J.0 tPlant and soil.g2021 Mar., v. 460, no. 1-2 p.541-557dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:jnl49373x0032-079X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11104-020-04823-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02615naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245009600167300001600263520149300279592002801772650002501800650002001825650001001845650001901855650002101874650001801895650000901913650001801922650002401940700001201964700001301976700001801989700001502007773009102022856008402113990002302197852000902220655001202229IND60083798420221119083131.0141101e201110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008379842DNAL7 a10.1016/j.acthis.2010.06.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXing, YiZhan10aImmunolocalization of Wnt5a during the hair cycle and its role in hair shaft growth in mice  ap. 608-612.  aPrevious studies have shown that the Wnt signaling pathway plays an important role in the growth and development of hair follicles. It has been generally accepted that Wnt5a, a non-canonical Wnt gene, inhibits the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. Several reports have addressed its mRNA expression in embryonic and postnatal hair follicles, but its exact role in the growth of hair follicles is currently unknown. In this study, we investigated the immunolocalization of Wnt5a protein in pelages of the dorsal skin and whisker follicles of mice. We found that in the anagen phase, dermal papilla cells showed the highest staining levels of Wnt5a protein, while in the catagen and the telogen phases the staining levels were lower. During the growth stage, Wnt5a protein was prominently located in the matrix and precortex cells in addition to the inner root sheath, outer root sheath and the dermal papilla. As the hair cycle progresses, the immunostaining of Wnt5a was gradually decreased in the catagen phase and was located in the bulge and secondary hair germ in the telogen phase. This Wnt5a immunostaining profile was consistent between dorsal skin pelages and whisker follicles. Furthermore, in an in vitro study using whisker follicle organ culture, we demonstrated that the growth of the hair shaft was significantly inhibited by adenovirus Wnt5a. Our findings suggest that Wnt5a is a dynamic factor in the hair cycle and it is important for the regulation of hair shaft growth.  aPublisher supplied data 3adevelopmental stages 3agene expression 3agenes 3ahair follicles 3ain vitro studies 3amessenger RNA 3amice 3aorgan culture 3asignal transduction1 aXu, Wei1 aYang, Ke1 aLian, XiaoHua1 aYang, Tian0 tActa histochemica.g2011 Oct., v. 113, no. 6 p.608-612dElsevier GmbHx0065-12817nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.acthis.2010.06.0063Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02643naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006100148245006500209300001600274500001900290520142800309592002801737596006501765650001901830650003001849650001501879650001901894650001701913650002001930650001501950650002901965650001601994700002102010700001902031773012802050856008202178852000902260655001202269IND60731628020221119043930.0210321e202103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073162802DNAL7 a10.1007/s11104-020-04781-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSlette, Ingrid J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7707-324610aFire history as a key determinant of grassland soil CO2 flux  ap. 579-592.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aAIMS: Fire regimes are key drivers of ecosystem dynamics and are changing worldwide. Uncertainty about how fire history affects responses to individual fires hampers predictions of fire impacts on important ecosystem functions such as C cycling. Thus, we assessed how fire and fire history affect soil CO₂ flux and aboveground net primary production (ANPP). METHODS: We utilized a 35-year fire frequency experiment in a mesic grassland to quantify how two aspects of fire history, long-term fire frequency (fire every one, two, or four years, or no fire) and number of years elapsed since the most recent fire, affect soil CO₂ flux. We used long-term annual records from the same grassland to compare this to the effect of fire history on ANPP. RESULTS: Historic fire frequency altered the soil CO₂ flux response to fire, with greater post-fire stimulation in grassland burned annually than in grassland burned less frequently (~100% vs. ~44% increase over long-term unburned grassland). The flux increase persisted for up to two years after fire. Though fire also stimulated ANPP, this increase did not vary by long-term fire frequency and did not persist into later years. CONCLUSIONS: Fire history modifies the soil CO₂ flux response to individual fires in this grassland. Predicting the dynamics of this important C flux will require considering not only the presence vs. absence of fire, but also fire history.  aPublisher supplied data  a2019-67011-29615cNational Institute of Food and Agriculture 3acarbon dioxide 3acarbon dioxide production 3aecosystems 3afire frequency 3afire history 3agrassland soils 3agrasslands 3anet primary productivity 3auncertainty1 aLiebert, Alannah1 aKnapp, Alan K.0 tPlant and soil.g2021 Mar., v. 460, no. 1-2 p.579-592dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:jnl49373x0032-079X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11104-020-04781-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02881naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100005700145245011300202300001800315520139200333592002801725650001501753650001301768650002401781650001201805650002401817650001101841650001701852650002601869650001401895650001501909650002601924650002601950650001101976650001401987650001002001650002302011650002002034700002802054700002802082700002502110700002102135700001602156773013902172856007902311852000902390655001202399IND60600825220180803000000.0180704e20180220xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060082522DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.est.7b059632doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStüken, Anke1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7553-952410aMicrobial Community Composition of Tap Water and Biofilms Treated with or without Copper–Silver Ionization  ap. 3354-3364.  aCopper–silver ionization (CSI) is an in-house water disinfection method primarily installed to eradicate Legionella bacteria from drinking water distribution systems (DWDS). Its effect on the abundance of culturable Legionella and Legionella infections has been documented in several studies. However, the effect of CSI on other bacteria in DWDS is largely unknown. To investigate these effects, we characterized drinking water and biofilm communities in a hospital using CSI, in a neighboring building without CSI, and in treated drinking water at the local water treatment plant. We used 16S rDNA amplicon sequencing and Legionella culturing. The sequencing results revealed three distinct water groups: (1) cold-water samples (no CSI), (2) warm-water samples at the research institute (no CSI), and (3) warm-water samples at the hospital (after CSI; ANOSIM, p < 0.001). Differences between the biofilm communities exposed and not exposed to CSI were less clear (ANOSIM, p = 0.022). No Legionella were cultured, but limited numbers of Legionella sequences were recovered from all 25 water samples (0.2–1.4% relative abundance). The clustering pattern indicated local selection of Legionella types (Kruskal–Wallis, p < 0.001). Furthermore, one unclassified Betaproteobacteria OTU was highly enriched in CSI-treated warm water samples at the hospital (Kruskal–Wallis, p < 0.001).  aPublisher supplied data 3aLegionella 3abacteria 3abeta-Proteobacteria 3abiofilm 3acommunity structure 3acopper 3adisinfection 3aenvironmental science 3ahospitals 3aionization 3amicrobial communities 3aresearch institutions 3asilver 3atap water 3awater 3awater distribution 3awater treatment1 aHaverkamp, Thomas H.

However, the mechanisms governing the regulation of lignin biosynthesis remain to be elucidated. In this study, we identified a lignin biosynthesis-associated transcription factor (LTF) from Populus, LTF1, which binds the promoter of a key lignin biosynthetic gene encoding 4-coumarate-CoA ligase (4CL). We showed that LTF1 in its unphosphorylated state functions as a regulator restraining lignin biosynthesis. When LTF1 becomes phosphorylated by PdMPK6 in response to external stimuli such as wounding, it undergoes degradation through a proteasome pathway, resulting in activation of lignification. Expression of a phosphorylation-null mutant version of LTF1 led to stable protein accumulation and persistent attenuation of lignification in wood cells. Taken together, our study reveals a mechanism whereby LTF1 phosphorylation acts as a sensory switch to regulate lignin biosynthesis in response to environmental stimuli. The discovery of novel modulators and mechanisms modifying lignin biosynthesis has important implications for improving the utilization of cell-wall biomass.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPopulus 3abiomass 3abiosynthesis 3acell walls 3acoumarate-CoA ligase 3agenes 3alignification 3alignin 3amutation 3aphosphorylation 3aproteasome endopeptidase complex 3atranscription factors 3awood 0alignin 0aPopulus 0asecondary xylem 0acell wall1 aLuo, Laifu1 aZhong, Yu1 aSun, Jiayan1 aUmezawa, Toshiaki1 aLi, Laigeng0 tMolecular plant.g2019 Oct. 07, v. 12, no. 10 p.1325-1337dElsevier Inc.wJournal:J000001387x1674-20527nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.molp.2019.05.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03636naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001600151245009000167300001600257520202600273592002802299650002602327650001802353650002302371650001702394650001402411650001002425650002202435650001302457650001102470650002602481650001002507653001502517653002902532653002102561653002602582653002402608700001902632700002602651700003002677700001102707700001802718700002302736700003202759700001902791700002102810700001602831700002402847773012902871856008503000852000903085655001203094IND60742118420221118025211.0210623e20210504xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074211842DNAL7 a10.1080/07352689.2021.19110342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHorn, Armin10aNatural Products from Bryophytes: From Basic Biology to Biotechnological Applications  ap. 191-217.  aNatural products from plants have served mankind in a wide range of applications, such as medicines, perfumes, or flavoring agents. For this reason, synthesis, regulation and function of plant-derived chemicals, as well as the evolution of metabolic diversity, has attracted researchers all around the world. In particular, vascular plants have been subject to such analyses due to prevalent characteristics such as appearance, fragrance, and ecological settings. In contrast, bryophytes, constituting the second largest group of plants in terms of species number, have been mostly overlooked in this regard, potentially due to their seemingly tiny, simple and obscure nature. However, the identification of highly interesting chemicals from bryophytes with potential for biotechnological exploitation is changing this perception. Bryophytes offer a high degree of biochemical complexity, as a consequence of their ecological and genetic diversification, which enable them to prosper in various, often very harsh habitats. The number of bioactive compounds isolated from bryophytes is growing rapidly. The rapidly increasing wealth of bryophyte genetics opens doors to functional and comparative genomics approaches, including disentangling of the biosynthesis of potentially interesting chemicals, mining for novel gene families and tracing the evolutionary history of metabolic pathways. Throughout the last decades, the moss Physcomitrella (Physcomitrium patens) has moved from being a model plant together with Marchantia polymorpha in fundamental biology into an attractive host for the production of biotechnologically relevant compounds such as biopharmaceuticals. In the future, bryophytes like the moss P. patens might also be attractive candidates for the production of novel bryophyte-derived chemicals of commercial interest. This review provides a comprehensive overview of natural product research in bryophytes from different perspectives together with biotechnological advances throughout the last decade.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMarchantia polymorpha 3aPhyscomitrium 3abiopharmaceuticals 3abiosynthesis 3aevolution 3agenes 3agenetic variation 3agenomics 3ahumans 3amosses and liverworts 3aodors 0aBryophytes 0aindustrial biotechnology 0anatural products 0aPhyscomitrella patens 0aplant biotechnology1 aPascal, Arnaud1 aLončarević, Isidora1 aVolpatto Marques, Raíssa1 aLu, Yi1 aMiguel, Sissi1 aBourgaud, Frederic1 aThorsteinsdóttir, Margrét1 aCronberg, Nils1 aBecker, Jörg D.1 aReski, Ralf1 aSimonsen, Henrik T.0 tCritical reviews in plant sciences.g2021 May 4, v. 40, no. 3 p.191-217dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl34283x1549-78367nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/07352689.2021.19110343Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02685naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094024002200126024001900148040001800167100002000185245012700205300001100332506007600343520133700419592002801756506003701784650001101821650001801832650001301850650002601863650001501889700002301904700002301927700002501950700002001975700002001995700002702015773015802042856007802200852000902278655001202287IND60515724620221207082228.0160319e201012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051572462DNAL7 a10.1186/1479-5868-7-252doi7 aPMC30994652pmcid7 a203503162pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBaranowski, Tom10aSelf efficacy for fruit, vegetable and water intakes: Expanded and abbreviated scales from item response modeling analyses  ap. 25.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aOBJECTIVE: To improve an existing measure of fruit and vegetable intake self efficacy by including items that varied on levels of difficulty, and testing a corresponding measure of water intake self efficacy. DESIGN: Cross sectional assessment. Items were modified to have easy, moderate and difficult levels of self efficacy. Classical test theory and item response modeling were applied. SETTING: One middle school at each of seven participating sites (Houston TX, Irvine CA, Philadelphia PA, Pittsburg PA, Portland OR, rural NC, and San Antonio TX). SUBJECTS: 714 6ᵗʰ grade students. RESULTS: Adding items to reflect level (low, medium, high) of self efficacy for fruit and vegetable intake achieved scale reliability and validity comparable to existing scales, but the distribution of items across the latent variable did not improve. Selecting items from among clusters of items at similar levels of difficulty along the latent variable resulted in an abbreviated scale with psychometric characteristics comparable to the full scale, except for reliability. CONCLUSIONS: The abbreviated scale can reduce participant burden. Additional research is necessary to generate items that better distribute across the latent variable. Additional items may need to tap confidence in overcoming more diverse barriers to dietary intake.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3amodels 3aself-efficacy 3astudents 3avegetable consumption 3avegetables1 aWatson, Kathleen B1 aBachman, Christine1 aBaranowski, Janice C1 aCullen, Karen W1 aThompson, Debbe1 aSiega-Riz, Anna Maria,0 tinternational journal of behavioral nutrition and physical activity.g2010 Dec., v. 7, no. 1 p.25-25dBioMed CentralwJournal:jnl4350546x1479-58687nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1479-5868-7-253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03135naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001500145245010400160300001800264520158900282592002801871650002401899650002001923650001101943650002901954650002601983650001702009650002402026650001102050650002102061650002802082650000702110650002002117650001302137650001602150700001402166700005102180700001602231700001202247700001402259700001702273700001302290700005402303700005702357773013902414856007902553852000902632655001202641IND60600825320221123011043.0180704e20180417xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060082532DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.est.7b059652doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhao, Jing10aHomo-Conjugation of Low Molecular Weight Organic Acids Competes with Their Complexation with Cu(II)  ap. 5173-5181.  aDissolved organic matter (DOM) controls the bioavailability and toxicity of heavy metals in aquatic environments. The observation of decreased conditional binding constants with increasing DOM concentration is not well documented, which may result in significant uncertainties in heavy metal behavior modeling and risk assessment. We used eight low molecular weight organic acids (LMOC) with representative structures to simulate DOM molecules. The interactions between LMOC molecules resulted in the decreased Cu(II)-LMOC binding with increasing LMOC concentrations, but higher pH values than theoretical calculation after mixing LMOC solutions of different pHs. We thus proposed homoconjugation between LMOC molecules through negative charge-assisted H-bond ((−)CAHB). A mathematic model was developed to describe Cu(II)–LMOC complexation (KC) and LMOC homoconjugation (KLHL). The increased competition of LMOC homoconjugation over Cu(II)–LMOC complexation, as suggested by the increased ratios of KLHL/KC, resulted in the apparently decreased Cu(II)–LMOC binding with the increased LMOC concentration. Similar concentration-dependent binding was also observed for DOM. With the identified homoconjugation between DOM molecules, some of the literature data with concentration-dependent behavior may be re-evaluated. This is the first work that quantitatively identified homoconjugation among organic molecules. Both the modeling concepts and results provide useful information in investigating the environmental roles of DOM in mediating metal bioavailability and transport.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaquatic environment 3abioavailability 3acopper 3adissolved organic matter 3aenvironmental science 3aheavy metals 3amathematical models 3amixing 3amolecular weight 3aorganic acids and salts 3apH 3arisk assessment 3atoxicity 3auncertainty1 aChu, Gang1 aPan, Bo1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3680-14511 aZhou, Yuwei1 aWu, Min1 aLiu, Yang1 aDuan, Wenyan1 aLang, Di1 aZhao, Qing1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2250-55711 aXing, Baoshan1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2028-12950 tEnvironmental science & technology.g2018 Apr. 17, v. 52, no. 9 p.5173-5181dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23339x1520-58517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.est.7b059653Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03690naa a2200697 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094024003600133040001800169100001800187245015600205300001800361506002800379506003600407506007600443506003100519520145900550592002802009596008302037506003702120650001302157650002102170650001802191650001002209650001202219650001902231650003002250650001002280650001602290650001102306650001702317650001402334650001302348650002302361650001502384650001302399650002002412650002202432650002002454650002602474650002502500653001902525653002102544653002402565653002202589653001502611653001202626700001702638700001302655700001802668700002302686700002702709700001602736773011402752856008302866903002202949852000902971655001202980IND60645634120221207082903.0191021e20191007xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064563412DNAL7 a10.1016/j.molp.2019.05.0102chorus7 a10.1016/j.molp.2019.05.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Dajian12aA Post-domestication Mutation, Dt2, Triggers Systemic Modification of Divergent and Convergent Pathways Modulating Multiple Agronomic Traits in Soybean  ap. 1366-1382.  aResource is Open Access  aElsevier BV License Information  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aCHORUS License Information  aThe semi-determinate stem growth habit in leguminous crops, similar to the “green revolution” semi-dwarf trait in cereals, is a key plant architecture trait that affects several other traits determining grain yield. In soybean semi-determinacy is modulated by a post-domestication gain-of-function mutation in the gene, Dt2, which encodes an MADS-box transcription factor. However, its role in systemic modification of stem growth and other traits is unknown. In this study, we show that Dt2 functions not only as a direct repressor of Dt1, which prevents terminal flowering, but also as a direct activator of putative floral integrator/identity genes including GmSOC1, GmAP1, and GmFUL, which likely promote flowering. We also demonstrate that Dt2 functions as a direct repressor of the putative drought-responsive transcription factor gene GmDREB1D, and as a direct activator of GmSPCH and GmGRP7, which are potentially associated with asymmetric division of young epidermal cells and stomatal opening, respectively, and may affect the plant's water-use efficiency (WUE). Intriguingly, Dt2 was found to be a direct activator or repressor of the precursors of eight microRNAs targeting genes potentially associated with meristem maintenance, flowering time, stomatal density, WUE, and/or stress responses. This study thus reveals the molecular basis of pleiotropy associated with plant productivity, adaptability, and environmental resilience.  aPublisher supplied data  cNational Institute of Food and Agriculturedhttps://doi.org/10.13039/1000058250 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aFabaceae 3aagronomic traits 3acell division 3acrops 3adrought 3aflowering date 3again-of-function mutation 3agenes 3agrain yield 3agrains 3agrowth habit 3ameristems 3amicroRNA 3aplant architecture 3apleiotropy 3asoybeans 3astem elongation 3astomatal movement 3astress response 3atranscription factors 3awater use efficiency 0aabiotic stress 0aagronomic traits 0aconvergent pathways 0astem growth habit 0apleiotropy 0asoybean1 aWang, Xutong1 aLi, Shuo1 aWang, Chaofan1 aGosney, Michael J.1 aMickelbart, Michael V.1 aMa, Jianxin0 tMolecular plant.g2019 Oct. 07, v. 12, no. 10 p.1366-1382dElsevier Inc.wJournal:J000001387x1674-20527nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.molp.2019.05.0103Available from publisher's site  aVersion of Record  aDNAL 7aarticle02932naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001500151245013300166300001600299520136900315536016701684592002801851596001301879596001901892650003401911650002401945650002401969650001701993650001502010650001002025650002102035650001502056650002502071650002202096650001802118653001402136653002602150653001802176653001802194653001402212653002502226773012902251856008502380852000902465655001202474IND60742118620221118025201.0210623e20210504xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074211862DNAL7 a10.1080/07352689.2021.19357192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLu, Shanfa10aBiosynthesis and Regulatory Mechanisms of Bioactive Compounds in Salvia miltiorrhiza, a Model System for Medicinal Plant Biology  ap. 243-283.  aSalvia miltiorrhiza is one of the most well known species in the genus Salvia of the Lamiaceae with great economic, academic and medicinal value. It was recorded as a traditional Chinese medicine material first in about the second century BC and later in many other ancient books. Salvia miltiorrhiza can be clinically used alone or mixed with other herbs to treat heart and cardiovascular diseases and is beneficial for management of many other diseases. In the last 30 years, S. miltiorrhiza has been studied intensively as a model system for medicinal plant biology. With the available of whole genome sequence of four S. miltiorrhiza lines and a large number of transcriptome, sRNAome and metabolome data, great progresses have been made in biosynthesis and regulatory mechanisms of bioactive compounds, such as tanshinones, phenolic acids, flavonoids, and prenylquinones. In this review, the recent results in the biosynthetic pathways of bioactive compounds in S. miltiorrhiza were summarized. The effects of biotic and abtiotic factors, plant hormones, transcription factors and noncoding RNAs on bioactive compound biosynthesis were overviewed. The mechanism of cross-talk and coordination among different biosynthetic pathways and the progress of metabolic engineering and synthetic biology for various bioactive compounds are also reviewed and discussed.  aThis work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China [81773836] and the CAMS Innovation Fund for Medical Sciences (CIFMS) [2016-I2M-3-016].  aPublisher supplied data  a81773836  a2016-I2M-3-016 3aOriental traditional medicine 3aSalvia miltiorrhiza 3abioactive compounds 3abiosynthesis 3aflavonoids 3aheart 3amedicinal plants 3ametabolome 3anucleotide sequences 3asynthetic biology 3atranscriptome 0aFlavonoid 0ametabolic engineering 0aphenolic acid 0aprenylquinone 0aterpenoid 0atranscription factor0 tCritical reviews in plant sciences.g2021 May 4, v. 40, no. 3 p.243-283dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl34283x1549-78367nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/07352689.2021.19357193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03280naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002700147245014600174300001600320520167300336592002802009650002202037650001202059650004102071650001102112650001002123650001602133650002102149650001102170650002702181650001302208650001102221653004302232653002502275653002302300653002702323653001702350653001002367653001002377653001002387653001502397653001502412653000802427653001002435653000702445700002102452700002602473700002402499700002102523773009202544856008102636852000902717655001202726IND60085877220221118093347.0160901e20131204xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008587722DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aca.2013.10.0252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMusharraf, Syed Ghulam10aMetabolite profiling of human plasma by different extraction methods through gas chromatography–mass spectrometry—An objective comparison  ap. 180-189.  aFor the comprehensive metabolite profiling of human plasma, sample preparation is a crucial step. In this investigation, we have compared 10 different extraction techniques for metabolite profiling by GC–MS. Six one-dimensional (1D) and four two-dimensional (2D) extraction techniques involving solvent precipitation, molecular weight cut off tube (MWCOT) and solid phase extraction (SPE) by using silica, RP C18, cation and anion were investigated. Pooled samples of 50 Healthy Male Plasma (HMP), 50 Healthy Female Plasma (HFP) and 100 Healthy Pakistani Plasma (HPP) were subjected to these extraction methods for comparison purposes. Metabolites obtained were identified through NIST mass spectral (Wiley registry), METLIN and Fiehn RTL libraries. XCMS Software was used for the detection of metabolic features, retention time correction, alignment, annotation and statistical analysis in each method. 116–34 peaks were detected by various methods and approx 33% of the peaks were characterized in each method. Hierarchical clustering of the 10 extraction methods showed a low similarity index (50.1%) which indicated different chemical nature of metabolites, resulting from different methods. Venn diagram highlights the GC–MS peaks (33–77%) common in various methods. Metabolites which were different in male and female groups were detected using a threshold value of p≤0.0001, q≤0.001 and fold change ≥3 by employing Welch's t-test and identified through METLIN. Results indicated that 2D-C18 and 2D-silica offers a comprehensive metabolite profile in term of reproducibility, number of peaks and difference in metabolite pattern of male and female.  aPublisher supplied data 3acomputer software 3afemales 3agas chromatography-mass spectrometry 3ahumans 3amales 3ametabolites 3amolecular weight 3asilica 3asolid phase extraction 3asolvents 3at-test 0aGas chromatography–mass spectrometry 0aMetabolite profiling 0aExtraction methods 0aSolid phase extraction 0aHuman plasma 0aHMP-P 0aHFP-P 0aHPP-P 0aHMPG1-G4-P 0aHFPG1-G4-P 0aSPE 0aMWCOT 0aSi1 aMazhar, Shumaila1 aSiddiqui, Amna Jabbar1 aChoudhary, M.

The main findings based on this evidence were: (1) school-based interventions generally lead to short term improvement in physical activity levels, but there were large differences between interventions with regard to effect sizes; (2) a multi-component approach (including environmental components) generally resulted in larger effect sizes, thereby providing evidence for the assumption that a multi-component approach should produce synergistic results; and (3) if an intervention aimed to affect more health behaviours besides physical activity, then the intervention appeared to be less effective in favour of physical activity.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aadolescents 3aphysical activity 3asystematic review0 tinternational journal of behavioral nutrition and physical activity.g2010 Dec., v. 7, no. 1 p.29-29dBioMed CentralwJournal:jnl4350546x1479-58687nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1479-5868-7-293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01802naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245011000158300002000268500001900288520074700307592002801054650000801082650000901090650001501099650001701114650001801131650001601149650001201165650001601177650001301193700002001206773014301226856007401369852000901443655001201452IND60714805320221120122400.0201024e20201006xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071480532DNAL7 a10.1039/d0ta07377f2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTanaka, Ellie10aPolyiodide solid-state dye-sensitized solar cell produced from a standard liquid I⁻/I₃⁻ electrolyte  ap. 19991-19999.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aSolid-state dye-sensitized solar cells were obtained by drying a standard I⁻/I₃⁻ liquid-electrolyte cell in ambient conditions.

PCE 5.0%), no loss in performance is displayed under dark storage in ambient air without any encapsulation for a period of around 10 months.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3adyes 3aelectrodes 3aelectrolytes 3aencapsulation 3aevaporation 3aliquids 3asolar cells 3asolvents1 aRobertson, Neil0 tJournal of materials chemistry A.g2020 Oct. 6, v. 8, no. 38 p.19991-19999dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26903x2050-74967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d0ta07377f3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02673naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100001900112245014900131300001600280500001900296520147900315592002801794650002401822650002401846650001701870650001401887650001301901650001501914650001701929653001801946653001601964653001101980653001201991653001402003653001102017653001402028700001902042700002202061700001702083773015402100852000902254655001202263IND60723679420221118032526.0210117e201303  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072367942DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKumar, Prabhat10aInterventions of non-monetary and monetary inputs to maximize growth and flowering of balsam (Impatiens balsamina L.) under north-western plains  ap. 141-148.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe present investigation was carried out at model Floriculture Centre of G.P.U.A.T, Pantnagar, Uttarakhand during the year 2010. The whole study was divided into two experiments based on planting method, i.e., transplanting and direct sowing and experiment was laid down in Split Plot Design with spacing in main plot and nutrients in sub plots with three replications. The main plot treatment consists of three spacings (20 x 30 cm, 30 x 30 cm and 40 x 40 cm), sub plot treatments consists of three levels of nitrogen (0, 15, 30 g N/m²), and three levels of phosphorous (0, 15, 30 g P₂O₅/m²). Application 30 g N+30 g P/m² resulted in maximum number of primary branches, leaves, plant spread and number of flowers/plant. Maximum number of secondary branches, plant height and flowering duration were recorded with 30 g N+15 g P/m². Spacing of (30 x 30 cm) gave maximum number of primary branches, leaf area and number offlowers/plant whereas, number of secondary branches and plant spread were found to be highest under 40 x 40 cm spacing. While, in case of direct sowing all the vegetative and floral characters were significantly influenced by higher dose of NP (30 g N + 30 g P/m²) and 30 x 30 cm spacing. Interactions between spacing and NP were found significantly superior in respect of number of flowers/plant. Therefore, it is concluded that application of 30g N + 30 g P and spacing of (30 x 30 cm) appeared to be optimum for balsam growth and development  aPublisher supplied data 3aImpatiens balsamina 3aexperimental design 3afloriculture 3aleaf area 3anitrogen 3aphosphorus 3aplant height 0aTransplanting 0adirect sown 0abalsam 0aspacing 0anutrients 0agrowth 0aflowering1 aRawat, Vandana1 aBasoli, Meenakshi1 aMishra, D.S.0 tProgressive horticulture.g2013 Mar., v. 45, no. 1 p.141-148dIndian Society of Horticultural Research and DevelopmentwJournal:2070x2249-52587nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle03265naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094024002200126024001900148040001800167100002200185245010700207300001100314506007600325520179100401592002802192506003702220650002202257650000902279650001302288650001902301650002802320650001802348650001002366650001802376650002202394650001902416650000902435650002002444650001102464651001902475700001802494700002002512700001802532773015802550856007802708852000902786655001202795IND60515724920221207093822.0160319e201012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051572492DNAL7 a10.1186/1479-5868-7-302doi7 aPMC28679882pmcid7 a204093102pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGriffiths, Lucy J10aAssociations between sport and screen-entertainment with mental health problems in 5-year-old children  ap. 30.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: Few studies have examined the benefits of regular physical activity, and risks of sedentary behaviour, in young children. This study investigated associations between participation in sports and screen-entertainment (as components of physical activity and sedentary behaviour), and emotional and behavioural problems in this population. METHODS: Cross-sectional analysis of data from 13470 children (50.9% boys) participating in the nationally representative UK Millennium Cohort Study. Time spent participating in sports clubs outside of school, and using screen-entertainment, was reported by the child's mother at child age 5 years, when mental health was also measured using the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire. RESULTS: 45% of children did not participate in sport clubs and 61% used screen-entertainment for ≥ 2 hours per day. Children who participated in sport had fewer total difficulties; emotional, conduct, hyperactivity-inattention and peer relationship problems; and more prosocial behaviours. These relationships were similar in boys and girls. Boys and girls who used screen-entertainment for any duration, and participated in sport, had fewer emotional and behavioural problems, and more prosocial behaviours, than children who used screen-entertainment for ≥ 2 hours per day and did not participate in sport. CONCLUSIONS: Longer durations of screen-entertainment usage are not associated with mental health problems in young children. However, our findings suggest an association between sport and better mental health. Further research based on longitudinal data is required to examine causal pathways in these associations and to determine the potential role of this and other forms of physical activity in preventing mental health disorders.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abehavior problems 3aboys 3achildren 3acohort studies 3across-sectional studies 3adata analysis 3agirls 3amental health 3aphysical activity 3aquestionnaires 3arisk 3asocial behavior 3asports 3aUnited Kingdom1 aDowda, Marsha1 aDezateux, Carol1 aPate, Russell0 tinternational journal of behavioral nutrition and physical activity.g2010 Dec., v. 7, no. 1 p.30-30dBioMed CentralwJournal:jnl4350546x1479-58687nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1479-5868-7-303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03791naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001100139245012800150300001600278500002000294520201400314592002802328650002202356650004402378650002502422650001602447650001502463650001302478650001302491650001102504650001402515650001102529650002302540650001002563650001702573650001302590650001802603650002702621650001702648650002502665650001102690650001402701650002302715650001902738650002502757650001002782650001602792651001102808651001802819700001502837700001702852700001902869700002002888700002102908700001202929700003202941773009802973856007303071852000903144655001203153IND60523296220221121122649.0160610e201606  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052329622DNAL7 a10.1111/efp.122472doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, M.10aPhysiological and biochemical differences among Ulmus minor genotypes showing a gradient of resistance to Dutch elm disease  ap. 215-228.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aDutch elm disease (DED) spread across Europe and North America in the 20th century killing most natural elm populations. Today, breeding programmes aim at identifying, propagating and studying elm clones resistant to DED. Here, we have compared the physiology and biochemistry of six genotypes of Ulmus minor of variable DED resistance. Leaf gas exchange, water potential, stem hydraulic conductivity and biochemical status were studied in 5‐year‐old trees of AB‐AM2.4, M‐DV2.3, M‐DV2 × M‐CC1.5 and M‐DV1 and 6‐year‐old trees of VA‐AP38 and BU‐FL7 before and after inoculation with Ophiostoma novo‐ulmi. Leaf water potential and net photosynthesis rates declined, while the percentage loss of hydraulic conductivity (PLC) increased after the inoculation in susceptible trees. By the 21st day, leaf predawn and midday water potential, stomatal conductance to water vapour and net photosynthesis rates were lower, and PLC was higher in trees of susceptible (S) genotypes inoculated with the pathogen than in control trees inoculated with water, whereas no significant treatment effect was observed on these variables in the resistant (R) genotypes. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy analyses revealed a different biochemical profile for branches of R and S clones. R clones showed higher absorption peaks that could be assigned to phenolic compounds, saturated hydrocarbons, cellulose and hemicellulose than S clones. The differences were more marked at the end of the experiment than at the beginning, suggesting that R and S clones responded differently to the inevitable wounding from inoculation and repeated sampling over the experimental course. We hypothesize that a weak activation of the defence system in response to experimental wounding can contribute to the susceptibility of some genotypes to O. novo‐ulmi. In turn, the decline in shoot hydraulic conductivity and leaf carbon uptake caused by the infection further exacerbates tree susceptibility to the fungus.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDutch elm disease 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aOphiostoma novo-ulmi 3aUlmus minor 3aabsorption 3abranches 3abreeding 3acarbon 3acellulose 3aclones 3adisease resistance 3afungi 3agas exchange 3agenotype 3ahemicellulose 3ahydraulic conductivity 3ahydrocarbons 3aleaf water potential 3aleaves 3apathogens 3aphenolic compounds 3aphotosynthesis 3astomatal conductance 3atrees 3awater vapor 3aEurope 3aNorth America1 aLópez, R.1 aVenturas, M.1 aMartin, J.

The fermentations were also tested with and without the addition of urea to determine if protease altered the nitrogen requirements of the yeast. Results show that the addition of the protease had a statistically significant effect on the fermentation rate and yield. Fermentation rates and yields were improved with the addition of the protease over the corresponding controls without protease. Protease addition either with or with added urea resulted in a higher final ethanol yield than without the protease addition. Urea addition levels >1200ppm of supplemental nitrogen inhibited ethanol production. The economic effects of the protease addition were evaluated by using process engineering and economic models developed at the Eastern Regional Research Center. The decrease in overall processing costs from protease addition was as high as $0.01/L (4¢/gal) of denatured ethanol produced.  aPublisher supplied data 3aeconometric models 3aeconomic impact 3aengineering 3aethanol 3aethanol production 3afermentation 3anitrogen 3aproteinases 3aurea 3ayeasts 0aProtease 0aEthanol 0aFermentation 0aBiofuel 0aCorn1 aMcAloon, Andrew J.0 tBioresource technology.g2014 Feb., v. 154 p.18-25dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46263x0960-85247nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2013.11.0433Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/ARS  aDNAL 7aarticle02754naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100005200145245014800197300001800345520132200363592002801685650001401713650002301727650002101750650002501771650000901796650001301805650001401818650001501832650003701847700001801884700001801902700001601920700001701936700001601953700001801969700006201987700005602049773013902105856007902244852000902323655001202332IND60600825720221120120206.0180704e20180316xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060082572DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.est.7b059962doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Rui1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6353-619310aAu@Pd Bimetallic Nanocatalyst for Carbon–Halogen Bond Cleavage: An Old Story with New Insight into How the Activity of Pd is Influenced by Au  ap. 4244-4255.  aAuPd bimetallic nanocatalysts exhibit superior catalytic performance in the cleavage of carbon–halogen bonds (C–X) in the hazardous halogenated pollutants. A better understanding of how Au atoms promote the reactivity of Pd sites rather than vaguely interpreting as bimetallic effect and determining which type of Pd sites are necessary for these reactions are crucial factors for the design of atomically precise nanocatalysts that make full use of both the Pd and Au atoms. Herein, we systematically manipulated the coordination number of Pd–Pd, d-orbital occupation state, and the Au–Pd interface of the Pd reactive centers and studied the structure–activity relationship of Au–Pd in the catalyzed cleavage of C–X bonds. It is revealed that Au enhanced the activity of Pd atoms primarily by increasing the occupation state of Pd d-orbitals. Meanwhile, among the Pd sites formed on the Au surface, five to seven contiguous Pd atoms, three or four adjacent Pd atoms, and isolated Pd atoms were found to be the most active in the cleavage of C–Cl, C–Br, and C–I bonds, respectively. Besides, neighboring Au atoms directly contribute to the weakening of the C–Br/C–I bond. This work provides new insight into the rational design of bimetallic metal catalysts with specific catalytic properties.  aPublisher supplied data 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3achemical bonding 3acleavage (chemistry) 3agold 3ananogold 3apalladium 3apollutants 3astructure-activity relationships1 aChen, Hui-min1 aFang, Li-ping1 aXu, Cuihong1 aHe, Zuoliang1 aLai, Yujian1 aZhao, Huachao1 aBekana, Deribachew1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1860-72441 aLiu, Jing-fu1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7134-70260 tEnvironmental science & technology.g2018 Mar. 16, v. 52, no. 7 p.4244-4255dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23339x1520-58517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.est.7b059963Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02923naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002300148245009900171300001600270520172200286592002802008653003102036653001802067653001502085653001802100700001602118700002202134700001902156700001902175700002302194700002002217700001902237700002102256700002602277700002202303773012102325856008202446852000902528655001202537IND60557555620221120045855.0170118e201702  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055755562DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcyt.2016.10.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHarris, William M.10aEvaluation of function and recovery of adipose-derived stem cells after exposure to paclitaxel  ap. 211-221.  aAdipose-derived stem cells (ASCs) are considered to play a positive role in wound healing as evidenced by their increasing use in breast reconstructive procedures. After chemotherapy for breast cancer, poor soft tissue wound healing is a major problem. In the present study, the functional capabilities and recovery of ASCs after exposure to chemotherapeutic agent paclitaxel (PTX) using in vitro and ex vivo models were demonstrated.Human ASCs were isolated from periumbilical fat tissue and treated with PTX at various concentrations. Adult Sprague-Dawley rats were given intravenous injections with PTX. Two and four weeks after the initial PTX treatment, ASCs were isolated from rat adipose tissue. Proliferation, cell viability, apoptosis and cell migration rates were measured by growth curves, MTT assays, flow cytometry and scratch assays. ASCs were cultured in derivative-specific differentiation media with or without PTX for 3 weeks. Adipogenic, osteogenic and endothelial differentiation levels were measured by quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction and histological staining.PTX induced apoptosis, decreased the proliferation and cell migration rates of ASCs and inhibited ASCs multipotent differentiation in both in vitro human ASC populations and ex vivo rat ASC populations with PTX treatment. Furthermore, after cessation of PTX, ASCs exhibited recovery potential of differentiation capacity in both in vitro and animal studies.Our results provide insight into poor soft tissue wound healing and promote further understanding of the potential capability of ASCs to serve as a cell source for fat grafting and reconstruction in cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy treatment.  aPublisher supplied data 0aadipose-derived stem cells 0abreast cancer 0apaclitaxel 0awound healing1 aZhang, Ping1 aPlastini, Michael1 aOrtiz, Telisha1 aKappy, Nikolas1 aBenites, Jefferson1 aAlexeev, Edward1 aChang, Shaohua1 aBrockunier, Ross1 aCarpenter, Jeffrey P.1 aBrown, Spencer A.0 tCytotherapy.g2017 Feb., v. 19 p.211-221dElsevier Inc.aInternational Society for Cellular Therapyx1465-32497nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcyt.2016.10.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02605naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100003200149245011300181300001400294520133300308592002801641650001901669650002201688650001701710650001601727650002001743650000901763650001401772650001401786650001301800650001201813653001901825653001601844653001801860653001901878653002901897700001901926700002401945773012101969856008402090852000902174655001202183IND60526915120221121152118.0190411e201603  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052691512DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ympev.2015.12.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMiller, Elizabeth Christina10aImproved resolution and a novel phylogeny for the Neotropical triplefin blennies (Teleostei: Tripterygiidae)  ap. 70-78.  aThe triplefin blennies (Teleostei: Tripterygiidae) are a diverse group of small-bodied benthic fishes associated with rocky or coral reefs. The Neotropics contain four genera and 26 species, many of which have only been recently described. A recent molecular phylogeny (Lin and Hastings, 2013) contrasts with previous phylogenies based on morphology in recovering the four Neotropical genera as a single clade with respect to the Indo-Pacific genera; however, relationships within and among genera were poorly resolved. This study reports a novel topology based on an expanded seven-loci molecular dataset. Individual gene trees have poor resolution, but concatenated analyses show strong support for most nodes, likely due to emergent support from concatenation. Consistent with Lin and Hastings (2013), three of the Neotropical genera, Axoclinus, Enneanectes, and Crocodilichthys, form a well-supported clade, but relationships of the fourth (Lepidonectes) are not confidently resolved. The monophyly of Axoclinus is well supported, but Enneanectes is paraphyletic with the inclusion of Axoclinus and Crocodilichthys. Improved resolution allows for reinterpretation of the biogeography of the Neotropical Tripterygiidae. Broader taxon sampling is still necessary for resolving the relationships within Tripterygiidae globally.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTripterygiidae 3abenthic organisms 3abiogeography 3acoral reefs 3adata collection 3afish 3amonophyly 3aparaphyly 3atopology 3atropics 0aTripterygiidae 0aShorefishes 0aConcatenation 0aHidden support 0aTropical Eastern Pacific1 aLin, Hsiu-Chin1 aHastings, Philip A.0 tMolecular phylogenetics and evolution.g2016 Mar., v. 96 p.70-78dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl3945168x1055-79037nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ympev.2015.12.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02854naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094024002200123024001900145040001800164100003900182245015500221300001800376506007600394520145100470592002801921506003701949650002201986650003202008650001202040650001702052650001602069700003502085700002902120700002902149700002402178700002202202700002502224773012302249856007502372852000902447655001202456IND60118429420221207075121.0141126e20140815xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011842942DNAL7 a10.1128/JB.01681-142doi7 aPMC41356292pmcid7 a249141862pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBarajas-Ornelas, Rocío del Carmen10aError-Prone Processing of Apurinic/Apyrimidinic (AP) Sites by PolX Underlies a Novel Mechanism That Promotes Adaptive Mutagenesis in Bacillus subtilis  ap. 3012-3022.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aIn growing cells, apurinic/apyrimidinic (AP) sites generated spontaneously or resulting from the enzymatic elimination of oxidized bases must be processed by AP endonucleases before they compromise cell integrity. Here, we investigated how AP sites and the processing of these noncoding lesions by the AP endonucleases Nfo, ExoA, and Nth contribute to the production of mutations (hisC952, metB5, and leuC427) in starved cells of the Bacillus subtilis YB955 strain. Interestingly, cells from this strain that were deficient for Nfo, ExoA, and Nth accumulated a greater amount of AP sites in the stationary phase than during exponential growth. Moreover, under growth-limiting conditions, the triple nfo exoA nth knockout strain significantly increased the amounts of adaptive his, met, and leu revertants produced by the B. subtilis YB955 parental strain. Of note, the number of stationary-phase-associated reversions in the his, met, and leu alleles produced by the nfo exoA nth strain was significantly decreased following disruption of polX. In contrast, during growth, the reversion rates in the three alleles tested were significantly increased in cells of the nfo exoA nth knockout strain deficient for polymerase X (PolX). Therefore, we postulate that adaptive mutations in B. subtilis can be generated through a novel mechanism mediated by error-prone processing of AP sites accumulated in the stationary phase by the PolX DNA polymerase.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aBacillus subtilis 3aDNA-directed DNA polymerase 3aalleles 3abacteriology 3amutagenesis1 aRamírez-Guadiana, Fernando H.1 aJuárez-Godínez, Rafael1 aAyala-García, Victor M.1 aRobleto, Eduardo A.1 aYasbin, Ronald E.1 aPedraza-Reyes, Mario0 tJournal of bacteriology.g2014 Aug. 15, v. 196, no. 16 p.3012-3022dAmerican Society for Microbiologyx0021-91937nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1128/JB.01681-143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02402naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001500150245009800165300001400263520125200277592002801529650001501557650002201572650002401594650001101618650001501629650001601644650001601660653004201676653003101718653001901749653002701768653002201795653002301817773009401840856008501934852000902019655001202028IND60607996520221119101754.0180831e201607  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060799652DNAL7 a10.1016/j.renene.2016.01.0882doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKara, Fuat10aTime domain prediction of power absorption from ocean waves with wave energy converter arrays  ap. 30-46.  aA three-dimensional transient numerical code ITU-WAVE based on potential theory and Neumann-Kelvin approximation is extended to take into account wave interaction in an array system using two and four truncated vertical cylinder arrays. ITU-WAVE panel code is validated against analytical array results before applied to power absorption from ocean waves for different array configurations. The effects of the separation distances between array system and heading angles on energy absorption in both sway and heave modes are studied by the support of numerical simulations which show sway mode has wider bandwidth than heave mode for energy absorption. It is also shown that wave interactions are stronger when the array systems are close and these wave interactions are reduced significantly and shifted to larger times when the separation distance is increased. The wave interaction is much stronger at the same separation distance and heading angle in heave mode than in sway mode. Numerical experience also shows that more power is absorbed in sway mode than in heave mode in both two and four array systems at any separation distances and heading angles when the bodies in array system have the same displacement in both sway and heave modes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3aenergy conversion 3amathematical models 3aoceans 3aprediction 3awater power 3awater waves 0aTransient free-surface Green function 0aBoundary integral equation 0aAbsorbed power 0aRelative capture width 0aArray interaction 0aInteraction factor0 tRenewable energy.g2016 July, v. 92 p.30-46dElsevier LtdwJournal:11970x0960-14817nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.renene.2016.01.0883Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03050naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001800143245015000161300001600311500001900327520159900346592002801945650001601973650001201989650001302001650001002014650001302024650001302037650001502050650000902065650002302074650001502097650002002112650001502132650002202147650001202169651001202181653002002193653001702213653002302230653001702253653002202270700001802292700001802310700002302328773010702351856007702458852000902535655001202544IND60678758320210418000000.0191216e20191201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067875832DNAL7 a10.2478/eko-2019-00252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAdjabi, Amina10aFloristic Distribution According to the Edaphic Parameters of a Steppe Zone, Case of Study: The Nature Reserve “El-Mergueb” M’sila, Algeria  ap. 336-352.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe natural site of El-Mergueb, is one of the specific steppe ecosystem, that occupies an area of 16,481 ha; it is among the particular ecosystems in Algeria and is unique in northern Africa. It is located in the geographical limit of the Tell Atlas and the Saharan Atlas. It is at an altitude of 550 to 800 m, with a typically arid climate. The faunistic and floristic richness, quite specifically, contains species protected and classified in the IUCN: Chlamydotis and Gazella, as well as an autochthonous plant diversity: Stipa, Pistacia and Ziziphus. This study is based on the analysis of the vegetation by characterizing the associated soil type through the monitoring of the Eco-pedological relation during two seasons in three years: 2015−2016−2017. Nine soil profiles with a collection of twenty-one samples for each station of experimentation were collected. The results thus obtained showed that the content of the parameters analyzed is between low and average of the three stations. The average of the floristic analysis of the study area made it possible to define 34 botanical families spread over 69 botanical genus and 275 species. The analysis and the description of a natural space is important to establish a typology which is that is the basis for the development of management plans to conserve this category of protected areas. The FAC (Factorial Analysis of Correspondence) is relative to the individualization and the typology for three sequences, which corresponds to the groups (A), (B) and (C) also for the places in arid climate variants with very cold winters.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChlamydotis 3aGazella 3aPistacia 3aStipa 3aZiziphus 3aaltitude 3aarid zones 3acold 3aconservation areas 3aecosystems 3afactor analysis 3asoil types 3aspecies diversity 3asteppes 3aAlgeria 0aprotected areas 0asteppe soils 0aanthropic pressure 0aarid climate 0asteppe vegetation1 aSidi, Hachemi1 aBounar, Rabah1 aNaseri, Hamid Reza0 tEkológia (Bratislava).g2019 Dec. 01, v. 38, no. 4 p.336-352dSciendowJournal:23080x1337-947X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2478/eko-2019-00253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03456naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002600147245014200173506010400315506007600419520142000495592002801915506003701943650001001980650001601990650002002006650001002026650002402036650001802060650002002078650001902098650002902117650001302146653002002159653003602179653002402215653002302239653002602262653002902288653000802317653000902325653000602334653000602340653000802346653000902354653000702363653000702370653000802377653001802385653000602403653000802409700002502417700005702442700001802499700006002517700005602577773009402633856008202727852000902809655001202818IND60766507920221207055110.0220726e202204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076650792DNAL7 a10.1016/j.dib.2022.1079262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLampret, Barbka Repic10aData on phenylalanine-to-tyrosine ratios in assessment of tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4)-responsiveness in patients with hyperphenylalaninemia  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBlood phenylalanine-to-tyrosine (Phe/Tyr) ratio is an important indicator of metabolic control in phenylketonuria patients. We present the data that highlights the role of Phe/Tyr-ratio in the evaluation of tetrahydrobiopterin (BH₄)-responsiveness in patients with hyperphenylalaninemia. Our data complements the results from the original research article by Tansek et al., 2012 [1]. We performed a BH₄-loading test in 32 patients after four days of increased protein intake (2000 mg/kg body weight). Blood sampling was performed 96, 72, 48, 24, 16 h, and moments before oral administration of BH₄ in a dose of 20 mg/kg body weight. Additional blood samples were collected 8 and 24 h after its administration. Phenylalanine (Phe) and Tyrosine (Tyr) levels were determined from dried blood spots by tandem mass spectrometry. Phe/Tyr-ratio reached a plateau after three days of increased dietary protein intake. Fifteen patients (47%) responded to BH₄, defined as a decrease of Phe-of at least 30% after 24 h of BH₄ administration. Phe/Tyr-ratios were significantly higher in non-responders compared to responders. In the responder group, Phe/Tyr-ratios decreased in average of 67% (p = 0.001) and 45% (p = 0.001) after 8 and 24 h of BH₄ administration, respectively. Phe/Tyr-ratio decreased after 8 h of drug administration also in the non-responder group, but not 24 h after administration.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3ablood 3abody weight 3adietary protein 3adrugs 3aoral administration 3aphenylalanine 3aphenylketonuria 3aprotein intake 3atandem mass spectrometry 3atyrosine 0aPhenylketonuria 0aPhenylalanine-to-tyrosine ratio 0aTetrahydrobiopterin 0aBH4-responsiveness 0aHyperphenylalaninemia 0aTandem mass spectrometry 0aBH4 0acPKU 0aF 0aM 0aMHP 0amPKU 0aNI 0aNR 0aPhe 0aPhe/Tyr-ratio 0aR 0aTyr1 aTansek, Mojca Zerjav1 aGroselj, Blaz1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4799-29781 aSikonja, Jaka1 aBattelino, Tadej1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0273-47321 aGroselj, Urh1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5246-98690 tData in Brief.g2022 Apr., v. 41 p.107926-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:23203x2352-34097nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.dib.2022.1079263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01567naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002400143245028100167300001600448520032700464592002800791650002200819650002200841650001300863650001500876650002000891650001100911653005500922653002200977700001900999773013701018856007701155852000901232655001201241IND60521855620221116180513.0160531e20140602xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052185562DNAL7 a10.1515/znb-1989-03092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHummel, Hans-Ulrich10aÜber Verbindungen subvalenter Hauptgruppenmetallkationen mit Dithiolaten, 3.

After various periods of storage the cut inflorescences were transferred to 25°C. Water-soaking of the tepals was the main chilling-injury symptom. Cv. Earsakul showed higher CI sensitivity than cv. Khao Sanan. Phospholipase D (PLD) activity increased during 5°C storage in both cultivars, but generally increased more in cv. Earsakul during the subsequent period at 25°C. The level of lipid degradation products (including malondialdehyde) that react with thiobarbaturic acid was higher in cv. Earsakul than in cv. Khao Sanan. In contrast to expectation, the ratio between unsaturated and saturated fatty acids was higher, and remained higher during cold storage, in cv. Earsakul than in cv. Khao Sanan. The data suggest that water-soaking due to cold storage of Dendrodium inflorescences involves membrane damage, likely related to activation of PLD and accumulation of lipid degradation products. The level of unsaturated fatty acids apparently did not protect against CI. The data seem to question the general view that unsaturated fatty acids protect against CI.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDendrobium 3acold storage 3acultivars 3afatty acid composition 3ainflorescences 3amalondialdehyde 3aphospholipase D 3astorage time 3aunsaturated fatty acids 0aDendrobium flower 0aWater-soaking 0aLow temperature 0aElectrolyte leakage 0aPhospholipase D 0aLipoxygenase 0aMalondialdehyde1 aKetsa, Saichol1 avan Doorn, Wouter G.0 tPostharvest biology and technology.g2013 June, v. 80 p.47-55dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl47454x0925-52147nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.postharvbio.2013.01.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02240naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001900152245013100171300001600302520100400318592002801322650002401350650001101374650001901385650001501404650001201419650001001431650001201441650002301453650002001476653002401496653002001520653001401540653001501554653001901569700001801588700002201606773010601628856008701734852000901821655001201830IND60536392120221119104549.0190409e201401  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053639212DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biortech.2013.11.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSuhartini, Sri10aComparison of mesophilic and thermophilic anaerobic digestion of sugar beet pulp: Performance, dewaterability and foam control  ap. 202-211.  aDigestion of sugar beet pulp was assessed in relation to biogas and methane production, foaming potential, and digestate dewaterability. Four 4-litre working volume digesters were operated mesophilically (37±0.5°C) and four thermophilically (55±0.5°C) over three hydraulic retention times. Digesters were operated in duplicate at organic loading rates (OLR) of 4 and 5g volatile solids l−1day−1 without water addition. Thermophilic digestion gave higher biogas and methane productivity than mesophilic and was able to operate at the higher OLR, where mesophilic digestion showed signs of instability. Digestate dewaterability was assessed using capillary suction time and frozen image centrifugation. The occurrence of, or potential for, stable foam formation was assessed using a foaming potential test. Thermophilic operation allowed higher loadings to be applied without loss of performance, and gave a digestate with superior dewatering characteristics and very little foaming potential.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanaerobic digestion 3abiogas 3acentrifugation 3adewatering 3afoaming 3afoams 3amethane 3amethane production 3asugar beet pulp 0aAnaerobic digestion 0aSugar beet pulp 0aDigestate 0aDewatering 0aFoam formation1 aHeaven, Sonia1 aBanks, Charles J.0 tBioresource technology.g2014 Jan., v. 152 p.202-211dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46263x0960-85247nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2013.11.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01975naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100006100142245009800203300001800301520070900319592002801028650001601056650001301072650002401085700002701109700006201136700001901198700001801217700002301235700001701258700005901275700005901334773014701393856007601540852000901616655001201625IND60742115720220219000000.0210623e20210609xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074211572DNAL7 a10.1021/jacs.1c048352doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHaut, Franz-Lucas1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2091-627010aSynthesis of Pyrroles via Consecutive 6π-Electrocyclization/Ring-Contraction of Sulfilimines  ap. 9002-9008.  aWe present a modular, synthetic entry to polysubstituted pyrroles employing readily available 2,5-dihydrothiophenes. Ring-opening of the heterocycle provides access to a panel of 1,3-dienes which undergo pyrrole formation in the presence of inexpensive chloramine-T trihydrate. The transformation is conducted in an open flask and proceeds at ambient temperatures (23 °C) in nondry solvents. A careful adjustment of the electronics and sterics of the 1,3-diene precursor allows for the isolation of key intermediates. DFT studies identified a reaction mechanism that features a 6π-electrocyclization of a sulfilimine intermediate followed by spontaneous ring-contraction to reveal the pyrrole skeleton.  aPublisher supplied data 3aelectronics 3apyrroles 3areaction mechanisms1 aFeichtinger, Niklas J.1 aPlangger, Immanuel1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9912-53771 aWein, Lukas A.1 aMüller, Mira1 aStreit, Tim-Niclas1 aWurst, Klaus1 aPodewitz, Maren1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7256-12191 aMagauer, Thomas1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1290-95560 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2021 June 09, v. 143, no. 24 p.9002-9008dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19166x1520-51267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jacs.1c048353Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02786naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100005800145245007800203300001800281520149400299592002801793650002701821650001201848650001401860650002301874650002301897650001801920650001301938650001601951650001401967650001401981650001301995650001502008650002002023650002302043700005602066700002702122773013902149856007902288852000902367655001202376IND60600823120221119143047.0180704e20180301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060082312DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.est.7b058342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuo, Xiangchen1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7932-456310aRuthenium Catalysts for the Reduction of N-Nitrosamine Water Contaminants  ap. 4235-4243.  aN-Nitrosamines have raised extensive concern due to their high toxicity and detection in treated wastewater and drinking water. Catalytic reduction is a promising alternative technology to treat N-nitrosamines, but to advance this technology pathway, there is a need to develop more-efficient and cost-effective catalysts. We have previously discovered that commercial catalysts containing ruthenium (Ru) are unexpectedly active in reducing nitrate. This study evaluated supported Ru activity for catalyzing reduction of N-nitrosamines. Experiments with N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA) show that contaminant is rapidly reduced on both commercial and in-house prepared Ru/Al₂O₃ catalysts, with the commercial material yielding an initial metal weight-normalized pseudo-first-order rate constant (k₀) of 1103 ± 133 L·gRᵤ–¹·h–¹ and an initial turnover frequency (TOF₀) of 58.0 ± 7.0 h–¹. NDMA is reduced to dimethylamine (DMA) and ammonia end-products, and a small amount of 1,1-dimethylhydrazine (UDMH) was detected as a transient intermediate. Experiment with a mixture of five N-nitrosamines spiked into tap water (1 μg L–¹ each) demonstrates that Ru catalysts are very effective in reducing a range of N-nitrosamine structures at environmentally relevant concentrations. Cost competitiveness and high catalytic activities with a range of contaminants provide a strong argument for developing Ru catalysts as part of the water purification and remediation toolbox.  aPublisher supplied data 3aN-nitrosodimethylamine 3aammonia 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3acost effectiveness 3adimethylamine 3anitrates 3aremediation 3aruthenium 3atap water 3atoxicity 3awastewater 3awater pollution 3awater purification1 aLiu, Jinyong1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1473-53771 aStrathmann, Timothy J.0 tEnvironmental science & technology.g2018 Mar. 01, v. 52, no. 7 p.4235-4243dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23339x1520-58517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.est.7b058343Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02769naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002300147245015800170300001400328520152800342592002801870650001501898650001401913650001301927650002901940650001001969653002401979653001202003653001702015653001002032653001402042700002002056700001602076700001702092700002702109700002102136700002202157773009002179856008102269852000902350655001202359IND60085874420221118091555.0160901e20131113xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008587442DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aca.2013.09.0342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJäntti, Sirkku E.10aSteroid and steroid glucuronide profiles in urine during pregnancy determined by liquid chromatography–electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry  ap. 56-66.  aAn ultra performance liquid chromatography–electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC–MS/MS) method was developed for the analysis of steroids and their glucuronides in urine samples. The method provides high sensitivity and fast analysis, as both steroids and their glucuronides can be analyzed directly without hydrolysis or complex sample preparation. The method was applied in profiling of targeted and nontargeted steroids and steroid glucuronides during pregnancy. The concentrations of 11 of 27 targeted steroids and steroid glucuronides and the concentrations of 25 nontargeted steroid glucuronides increased about 10–400 fold during the pregnancy. The concentrations of most of these 36 compounds began to increase in the first days of the pregnancy, increased gradually during the pregnancy, achieved a maximum in late pregnancy, and decreased sharply after delivery. Exceptionally, the concentrations of allopregnanolone and 17-hydroxypregnenolone started to increase later than those of the other steroids. Moreover, the concentrations of E2 glucuronides began to decrease one week before the delivery, in contrast to most of the steroids and steroid glucuronides, whose concentrations dropped sharply during the delivery. Concentrations of 34 compounds decreased noticeably when the subject was on sick leave owing a series of painful contractions. The results suggest that steroids and especially steroid glucuronides may provide a valuable diagnostic tool to follow the course of pregnancy.  aPublisher supplied data 3ahydrolysis 3apregnancy 3asteroids 3atandem mass spectrometry 3aurine 0aSteroid glucuronide 0aSteroid 0aUPLC–MS/MS 0aUrine 0aPregnancy1 aHartonen, Minna1 aHilvo, Mika1 aNygren, Heli1 aHyötyläinen, Tuulia,1 aKetola, Raimo A.1 aKostiainen, Risto0 tAnalytica chimica acta.g2013 Nov. 13, v. 802 p.56-66dElsevier B.V.x0003-26707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aca.2013.09.0343Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02886naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002400148245018800172300001600360520119100376592002801567650002601595650001101621650001001632650002801642650001001670650001701680650001001697650001301707650002101720650001001741650001601751650003001767650002501797650001401822650001201836650001401848651001101862653002601873653001701899653005601916653002201972653003501994653001202029700002302041700002302064700002602087700002102113773011702134856008402251852000902335655001202344IND60125136620221120163518.0151102e201209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012513662DNAL7 a10.1637/10027-113011-Reg.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChrząstek, Klaudia10aMolecular Epidemiologic Investigation of Polish Avian Pasteurella multocida Strains Isolated from Fowl Cholera Outbreaks Showing Restricted Geographical and Host-Specific Distribution  ap. 529-536.  aMolecular epidemiologic analyses of the 42 clinical isolates of Pasteurella multocida from various avian hosts (geese, ducks, turkeys, and laying hens) in Poland from 2001 to 2011, including a single reference strain, were performed by enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus (ERIC)-PCR, single primer PCR, and repetitive extragenic palindromic (REP)–PCR. Forty-two isolates were identified as P. multocida (serotype A). The majority of P. multocida strains were obtained from waterfowl clustered within one genotype, and they were not consistent with the genotypes obtained from the turkey strains. Pasteurella multocida showed genetic homogeneity between the host species, especially when isolated on the same farm. Some of the clones also were characteristic to the particular farm. The strains obtained in different regions represent distinct molecular patterns. The present findings demonstrate that some clones of P. multocida are restricted in geographical and host distribution. In addition, this study suggests that ERIC-PCR, single primer PCR, and REP-PCR are suitable techniques for studying the host adaptation of P. multocida and the epidemiology of fowl cholera.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPasteurella multocida 3aclones 3aducks 3aepidemiological studies 3afarms 3afowl cholera 3ageese 3agenotype 3ahost specificity 3ahosts 3alaying hens 3apolymerase chain reaction 3arepetitive sequences 3aserotypes 3aturkeys 3awaterfowl 3aPoland 0aPasteurella multocida 0afowl cholera 0aenterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus-PCR 0asingle primer PCR 0arepetitive genomic element-PCR 0apoultry1 aKuczkowski, Maciej1 aWieliczko, Anna K.1 aBednarek, Karolina J.1 aWieliczko, Alina0 tAvian diseases.g2012 Sept., v. 56, no. 3 p.529-536dAmerican Association of Avian Pathologistsx1938-43517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1637%2F10027-113011-Reg.13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02113naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094024002200122024001900144040001800163100001200181245013100193300001800324506007600342520081400418592002801232506003701260650002501297650002301322650001201345650002201357650001601379650003001395650001501425700002101440700003201461700002201493773012901515856007401644852000901718655001201727IND60673695320221207141427.0191018e20191017xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067369532DNAL7 a10.1039/c9ay01199d2doi7 aPMC69979412pmcid7 a320216582pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Tao12aA disposable acetylcholine esterase sensor for As(iii) determination in groundwater matrix based on 4-acetoxyphenol hydrolysis  ap. 5203-5213.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThere is a lack of field compatible analytical methods for the speciation of As(iii) to characterize groundwater pollution at anthropogenic sites. To address this issue, an inhibition-based acetylcholine esterase (AchE) sensor was developed to determine As(iii) in groundwater. 4-Acetoxyphenol was employed to develop an amperometric assay for AchE activity. This assay was used to guide the fabrication of an AchE sensor with screen-printed carbon electrode. An As(iii) determination protocol was developed based on the pseudo-irreversible inhibition mechanism. The analysis has a dynamic range of 2–500 μM (150–37 500 μg L⁻¹) for As(iii). The sensor exhibited the same dynamic range and sensitivity in a synthetic groundwater matrix. The electrode was stable for at least 150 days at 22 ± 2 °C.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aacetylcholinesterase 3aanalytical methods 3aarsenic 3acarbon electrodes 3agroundwater 3agroundwater contamination 3ahydrolysis1 aBerberich, Jason1 aSahle-Demessie, Endalkachew1 aVarughese, Eunice0 tAnalytical methods.g2019 Oct. 17, v. 11, no. 40 p.5203-5213dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26912x1759-96797nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c9ay01199d3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02939naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100006100147245008700208506011700295506007600412520128900488592002801777506003701805650001601842650001601858650002001874650001301894650001601907650000901923650002001932650001401952650002401966650001601990651001202006653002002018653001402038653002202052653001702074700006002091700001802151700001702169700002602186700006002212773009402272856008202366852000902448655001202457IND60766508220221207075604.0220726e202204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076650822DNAL7 a10.1016/j.dib.2022.1079292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSzékely, Árpád1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5336-748510aData of selected set of rice accessions at the germination stage under cold stress  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aHungary is northernmost temperate rice growing country in Europe. One of the main limiting factors is low temperature, especially at germination and seedling developmental stages. In early developmental stages, low temperature can impair and delay germination, as well as have negative impacts on seedling growth, causing poor stand establishment and non-uniform crop maturation [1]. Temperatures lower than 15 °C are generally detrimental for germination [2] under filed conditions for establishment of the crop. This article describes some key germination parameters of 165 rice accessions including breeding lines and varieties. Each genotype was grown in three replicates in a controlled cabinet under 13 °C for 4 weeks’ duration. Growth was measured every 7th day. Growth traits such as coleoptile and radicle length were measured at the end of the experiment. The average data were calculated for three replicates. This dataset contains germination raw data and five germination parameters such as median germination time (MGT), final germination percentage (FGP), germination index (GI), coleoptile length (CL) and radicle length (RL). These data may provide reliable support for researchers and breeders to select the right rice genotypes for low temperature conditions.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3acold stress 3acoleoptiles 3adata collection 3agenotype 3agermination 3arice 3aseedling growth 3aseedlings 3astand establishment 3atemperature 3aHungary 0aChilling stress 0aGermplasm 0aGermination index 0aOryza sativa1 aSzalóki, Tímea1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4145-66051 aLantos, Csaba1 aPauk, János1 aVenkatanagappa, Shoba1 aJancsó, Mihály1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1934-96860 tData in Brief.g2022 Apr., v. 41 p.107929-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:23203x2352-34097nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.dib.2022.1079293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02661naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001600145245009900161300001800260520127300278592002801551650003401579650001501613650001601628650001301644650001401657650002501671650001701696650001301713650001301726700002001739700002201759700001901781700002201800700002301822700002001845700003501865700001601900700003101916700002101947700002001968773012701988856007902115852000902194655001202203IND60300897720221122134700.0150703e20130315xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6030089772DNAL7 a10.1126/science.12329272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMori, Kohji14aThe C9orf72 GGGGCC Repeat Is Translated into Aggregating Dipeptide-Repeat Proteins in FTLD/ALS  ap. 1335-1338.  aUnusual Aggregates Several recent papers have revealed the unexpected genetic and pathological overlap between frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). The most common genetic cause is the GGGGCC hexanucleotide repeat expansion upstream of the C9orf72 coding region affecting about 10% of all patients. It is currently unknown how repeat expansion might lead to neurodegeneration. C9orf72 patients show two distinct types of ubiquitinated inclusions in the central nervous system, one of which was identified as phosphorylated TDP-43 protein. However, all inclusions in the cerebellum and most inclusions in the hippocampus and neocortex lack TDP-43, and the actual disease protein is unknown. Mori et al. (p. 1335, published online 7 February; see the Perspective by Taylor) discovered that most of these characteristic inclusions contain poly-(Gly-Ala) and, to a lesser extent, poly-(Gly-Pro) and poly-(Gly-Arg) dipeptide-repeat proteins that are generated by non-ATG–initiated translation from the expanded GGGGCC repeats in three reading frames. The findings yield mechanistic insight into the pathogenesis of FTLD/ALS with C9orf72 repeat expansions and directly link this common mutation to the characteristic pathology.  aPublisher supplied data 3aamyotrophic lateral sclerosis 3acerebellum 3ahippocampus 3amutation 3aneocortex 3anucleotide sequences 3apathogenesis 3apatients 3aproteins1 aWeng, Shih-Ming1 aArzberger, Thomas1 aMay, Stephanie1 aRentzsch, Kristin1 aKremmer, Elisabeth1 aSchmid, Bettina1 aKretzschmar, H.

In particular, one JE-L, produced by a domestic manufacturer in China, was prequalified by WHO in 2013. We assessed the safety of JE vaccines in China during 2008–2013 using the Chinese National Adverse Events Following Immunization Information System (CNAEFIS) data.We retrieved AEFI reporting data about JE vaccines from CNAEFIS, 2008–2013, examined demographic characteristics of AEFI cases, and used administrative data on vaccine doses as denominator to calculate and compare crude reporting rates. We also used disproportionality reporting analysis between JE-I and JE-L to assess potential safety signals.A total of 34,879 AEFIs related with JE-I and JE-L were reported, with a ratio of male to female as 1.3:1; 361 (1.0%) cases were classified as serious. JE vaccines were administered concurrently with one or more other vaccines in 13,592 (39.0%) of cases. The overall AEFI reporting rates were 214.4 per million vaccination doses for JE-L and 176.9 for JE-I (rate ratio [RR]: 1.2, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.1–1.3) in 2010–2013. Febrile convulsions (FC) following JE-I was found as a signal of disproportionate reporting (SDR). However, there was no significant difference between the reporting rates of FC of JE-I and JE-L (0.3 per million vaccination doses for JE-L, 0.4 for JE-I, p=0.05).While our analysis did not find apparent safety concern of JE vaccines in China, further study should consider JE-I vaccines and febrile convulsion, and taking more sensitive methods to detect signals.  aPublisher supplied data 3aWorld Health Organization 3aconfidence interval 3ademography 3aencephalitis 3afemales 3ainformation systems 3amales 3amonitoring 3aseizures 3avaccination 3avaccines 3aChina 0aVaccine safety 0aAdverse events following immunization 0aFebrile convulsion 0aJapanese encephalitis vaccine 0aDisproportionality analysis 0aSurveillance system 0aChina1 aLiu, Dawei1 aLi, Keli1 aNuorti, J.

However, because we do not have a lightweight, wireless recording system that is free of interference, it is still unclear how the neural activity of the mPFC region is involved in the diverse, interacting behaviors that comprise competition. Herein, we present an interference-free, lightweight, wireless neural probe system that we applied to two mice to measure mPFC neural activities during a food competition test. In the test, we categorized 18 behavioral repertoires expressed by the mice. From the analysis of the neural signals during each repetition of the test, we found that the mPFC neural activity had the most positive correlation with goal-driven competitive behaviors, such as guarding resources and behaviors related to the extortion of resources. Remarkably, we found that the neural activity associated with guarding behavior was higher than that of extorting behavior, and this highlighted the importance of resource-guarding behavior for winning the competition, i.e., ‘winning a trophy is hard, but keeping it is harder’. Our approach in which a wireless system is used will enable in-depth studies of the brains of mice in their natural social interactions.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiosensors 3amice 3aprefrontal cortex 3asocial behavior 3atest meals 3atesting 3awills 0aWireless neural probe system 0aBluetooth 0aFood competition 0aMedial prefrontal cortex 0aGuarding behavior 0aExtorting behavior1 aByun, Junweon1 aRoh, Donghyun1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8043-55351 aChoi, Nakwon1 aShin, Hee-Sup1 aCho, Il-Joo1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9016-67490 tBiosensors & bioelectronics.g2022 Jan. 01, v. 195 p.113665-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11631x0956-56637nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bios.2021.1136653Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03158naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100002300141245015700164300001800321500001900339520170200358592002802060650001702088650001902105650001502124650002502139650003002164650001402194650001802208650001502226650002602241650001002267650001502277650002102292650001902313650001702332650001302349651001502362651001402377700002102391700001902412700002702431773014602458856007502604852000902679655001202688IND60725667020221118191236.0210128e20201019xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072566702DNAL7 a10.1093/jee/toaa2152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCan-Vargas, Xareni10aSpatial Distribution of Whitefly Species (Hemiptera: Aleyrodidae) and Identification of Secondary Bacterial Endosymbionts in Tomato Fields in Costa Rica  ap. 2900-2910.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aIn Costa Rica, tomato (Solanum lycopersicum Linnaeus) Linnaeus (Solanales: Solanaceae) is one of the crops most severely affected by the whiteflies (Hemiptera: Aleyrodidae) Trialeurodes vaporariorum (Westwood) and the Bemisia tabaci (Gennadius) species complex. The objective of this study was to monitor the spatial distribution and diversity of these species and to detect the presence of secondary bacterial endosymbionts in individuals collected in areas of intensive tomato production. In total, 628 whitefly individuals were identified to the species level using restriction analysis (PCR-RFLP) of a fragment of the mitochondrial cytochrome C oxidase I gene (mtCOI). Trialeurodes vaporariorum was the predominant species, followed by B. tabaci Mediterranean (MED). Bemisia tabaci New World (NW) and B. tabaci Middle East-Asia Minor 1 (MEAM1) were present in lower numbers. The mtCOI fragment was sequenced for 89 individuals and a single haplotype was found for each whitefly species. Using molecular markers, the 628 individuals were analyzed for the presence of four endosymbionts. Arsenophonus Gherna et al.

This study confirmed that B. tabaci NW has not been completely displaced by the invasive species B. tabaci MED and B. tabaci MEAM1 present in the country.

Here, the essential roles of Pt–Au and Pt−oxide−Au interfaces on the activation of H₂ and the hydrogenation of para-nitrothiophenol (pNTP) were studied at molecular level by in situ surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) and shell-isolated nanoparticle-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SHINERS). Pt–Au and Pt–oxide–Au interfaces were fabricated through the synthesis of Pt-on-Au and Pt-on-SHINs nanocomposites. Direct spectroscopic evidence demonstrates that the atomic hydrogen species generated on the Pt nanocatalysts can spill over from Pt to Au via the Pt–Au and Pt–TiO₂–Au interfaces, but would be blocked at the Pt–SiO₂–Au interfaces, leading to the different reaction pathways and product selectivity on Pt-on-Au and Pt-on-SHINs nanocomposites. Such findings have also been verified by the density functional theory calculation. In addition, it is found that nanocatalysts assembled on pinhole-free shell-isolated nanoparticles (Pt-on-pinhole-free-SHINs) can override the influence of the Au core on the reaction and can be applied as promising platforms for the in situ study of heterogeneous catalysis. This work offers a concrete example of how SERS/SHINERS elucidate details about in situ reaction and helps to dig out the fundamental role of interfaces in catalysis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRaman spectroscopy 3acatalytic activity 3adensity functional theory 3agold 3ahydrogen 3ahydrogenation 3ananocomposites 3ananogold 3ananoparticles 3aplatinum 3aspectral analysis1 aZhang, Xia-Guang1 aWei, Jie1 aWang, Chen1 aChen, Shu1 aSun, Han-Lei1 aWang, Ya-Hao1 aChen, Bing-Hui1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7207-74861 aYang, Zhi-Lin1 aWu, De-Yin1 aLi, Jian-Feng1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1598-68561 aTian, Zhong-Qun1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9775-81890 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2017 Aug. 02, v. 139, no. 30 p.10339-10346dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19166x1520-51267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jacs.7b040113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03284naa a2200757 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094024002200133024001900155040001800174100002500192245016500217300001800382500001500400506007600415520101300491592002801504506003701532650003301569650002301602650002001625650002401645650001401669650001801683650001901701650002301720650000901743650001201752650001801764650002801782650002001810650001301830650001401843653001701857653002401874653000801898653003001906653002701936653001801963653000801981653000901989653000801998653000702006653001802013653000802031653000902039653000902048653000802057653002202065700001902087700002202106700002102128700001702149700002502166700002402191700002502215700002302240700002102263700002202284773011302306856008602419852000902505655001202514IND60569246720221207123507.0190319e20170622xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056924672DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vaccine.2017.05.0222doi7 aPMC55265972pmcid7 a285545032pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPenkert, Rhiannon R.10aSaccharomyces cerevisiae-derived virus-like particle parvovirus B19 vaccine elicits binding and neutralizing antibodies in a mouse model for sickle cell disease  ap. 3615-3620.  a2019-12-06  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aParvovirus B19 infections are typically mild in healthy individuals, but can be life threatening in individuals with sickle cell disease (SCD). A Saccharomyces cerevisiae-derived B19 VLP vaccine, now in pre-clinical development, is immunogenic in wild type mice when administered with the adjuvant MF59. Because SCD alters the immune response, we evaluated the efficacy of this vaccine in a mouse model for SCD. Vaccinated mice with SCD demonstrated similar binding and neutralizing antibody responses to those of heterozygous littermate controls following a prime-boost-boost regimen. Due to the lack of a mouse parvovirus B19 challenge model, we employed a natural mouse pathogen, Sendai virus, to evaluate SCD respiratory tract responses to infection. Normal mucosal and systemic antibody responses were observed in these mice. Results demonstrate that mice with SCD can respond to a VLP vaccine and to a respiratory virus challenge, encouraging rapid development of the B19 vaccine for patients with SCD.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3avirus-like particle vaccines 3asickle cell anemia 3aProtoparvovirus 3aMurine respirovirus 3aadjuvants 3aSaccharomyces 3aheterozygosity 3arespiratory system 3amice 3aviruses 3aanimal models 3aneutralizing antibodies 3aimmune response 3apatients 3apathogens 0aSendai virus 0aSickle cell disease 0aSCD 0aMucosal antibody response 0aParvovirus B19 vaccine 0aYeast-derived 0aHET 0ai.m. 0aSeV 0aNW 0aIntramuscular 0aVLP 0ai.n. 0aDPBS 0aBAL 0aSystemic antibody1 aYoung, Neal S.1 aSurman, Sherri L.1 aSealy, Robert E.1 aRosch, Jason1 aDormitzer, Philip R.1 aSettembre, Ethan C.1 aChandramouli, Sumana1 aWong, S.q(Susan),1 aHankins, Jane S.1 aHurwitz, Julia L.0 tVaccine.g2017 June 22, v. 35, no. 29 p.3615-3620dElsevier LtdaElsevier LtdwJournal:6210x0264-410X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2017.05.0223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02005naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100006400151245008300215506010400298506007600402520068000478592002801158506003701186650001301223650001101236650003001247650001001277650001401287653000801301653000801309653000801317653000801325653002101333653001501354653001801369653002801387773009701415856008601512852000901598655001201607IND60770750720221207122341.0220502e202205  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077075072DNAL7 a10.1016/j.econlet.2022.1104282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBenkert, Jean-Michel1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3231-322610aOn the equivalence of optimal mechanisms with loss and disappointment aversion  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aWe consider a standard, quasi-linear mechanism design setting in which agents’ outcomes consist of a binary part and a transfer, thus encompassing applications such as auctions, bilateral trade or public good provision.

While the preferences induced by these models only have a trivial intersection given by classical expected utility (Masatlioglu and Raymond, 2016), we show that the optimal mechanisms for the two types of preferences are equivalent across a broad range of problems and thus display a remarkable robustness.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aauctions 3amodels 3apublic services and goods 3atrade 3autilities 0aD01 0aD02 0aD82 0aD90 0aMechanism design 0aRobustness 0aLoss aversion 0aDisappointment aversion0 tEconomics letters.g2022 May, v. 214 p.110428-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:3059x0165-17657nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.econlet.2022.1104283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02813naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002700150245011000177300001600287500001500303520145000318592002801768650001601796650002501812650001801837650001701855650001801872650001301890650001101903650001701914650001501931650000801946650001301954650002301967650001601990650001202006653001102018653001602029653001602045653001302061653001502074700002102089700001902110700002802129773010202157856005102259852000902310655001202319IND50076362620221120074830.0140410e20130217xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007636262DNAL7 a10.1080/07373937.2012.7106952doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAl-Rawahi, Amani Salim10aChemical Composition, Water Sorption Isotherm, and Phenolic Contents in Fresh and Dried Pomegranate Peels  ap. 257-263.  a2019-12-05  aPomegranate peels were dried by freeze drying at 20°C; air and vacuum drying at 40, 60, and 90°C; and sun drying. The moisture sorption isotherm was measured and modeled using the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) and Guggenheim–Anderson–De Boer (GAB) models. Two solvents (methanol and ethanol) and water were used to extract the phenolic compounds in pomegranate fruit peel. Fresh peels contained 5,990, 4,530, and 8,460 mg gallic acid equivalent (GAE)/100 g dry-peel solids for methanol, ethanol, and water extracts, respectively. The total phenolic content of ethanol extracts of freeze-dried peels was comparable to that of fresh peels (4,900 mg GAE/100 g dry-peel solids), whereas air- and vacuum-dried peels had significantly lower phenolic contents. Peels air dried at 60°C had the highest phenolic content (2,320–4,650 mg/100 g dry-peel solids) compared to samples air dried at 40 or 90°C (1,160–4,480 mg/100 g dry-peel solids), whereas vacuum-dried peels did not show any trends with temperature. In general, methanol had a higher capacity for extracting phenolic compounds from dried pomegranate peels than water, and ethanol showed a low extraction capacity. In all cases, phenolic compounds were significantly lower in ethanol extracts compared to methanol or water extracts (p < 0.05). In addition, phenolic compounds soluble in water and ethanol were more sensitive to all drying methods except freeze drying.  aPublisher supplied data 3agallic acid 3achemical composition 3avacuum drying 3apomegranates 3afreeze drying 3amethanol 3amodels 3asolar drying 3aair drying 3aair 3asolvents 3asorption isotherms 3atemperature 3aethanol 0aDrying 0aPomegranate 0afruit peels 0aPhenolic 0aExtraction1 aRahman, Shafiur,1 aGuizani, Nejib1 aEssa, Musthafa Mohammad0 tDrying technology.g2013 Feb. 17, v. 31, no. 3 p.257-263dTaylor & Francis Groupx1532-23007nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/07373937.2012.710695  aDNAL 7aarticle01576naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100006900151245008900220520049300309592002800802650001700830650001200847650001600859653000800875653000800883653000800891653001600899653001600915653001100931653000700942700006300949700002201012773009701034856008601131852000901217655001201226IND60770750820221121015612.0220502e202205  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077075082DNAL7 a10.1016/j.econlet.2022.1104322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEleftheriou, Konstantinos1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4423-845110aDoes market power converge among the US states?

Based on the correlation of soil distribution and vegetation growth patterns across a topographically heterogeneous landscape, this study explores the use of topographic and vegetation attributes in addition to pedologic attributes to develop pedotransfer functions (PTFs) for estimating soil hydraulic properties in the Southern Great Plains of the USA. The extensive Southern Great Plains 1997 (SGP97) hydrology experiment database was used to derive these functions by using artificial neural networks. Eighteen models combining bootstrapping technique with artificial neural networks were developed in a hierarchical manner to predict the soil water contents at eight different soil water potentials (θ at 5, 10, 333, 500, 1000, 3000, 8000, and 15 000 cm) and the van Genuchten hydraulic parameters (θᵣ, θₛ, α, n). The performance of the neural network models was evaluated using the Spearman correlation coefficient between the observed and the predicted values and root mean square error (RMSE). Although variability exists within bootstrapped replications, improvements (of different levels of statistical significance) were achieved with certain input combinations of basic soil properties, topography and vegetation information compared with using only the basic soil properties as inputs. Topography (DEM) and vegetation (NDVI) attributes at finer scales were useful to capture the variations within the soil mapping units for the SGP97 region dominated by perennial grass cover.  aPublisher supplied data 3apedotransfer functions 3atopography 3asoil water content 3aequations 3aneural networks 3avegetation cover 3awatersheds 3aspatial data 3aremote sensing 3asoil texture 3asoil matric potential 3aOklahoma 3aGreat Plains region 0amathematical models 0asoil hydraulic properties1 aMohanty, Binayak P.1 aZhu, Jianting0 tSoil Science Society of America journal.g2006 Sept., v. 70, no. 5 p.1430-1440dSoil Science SocietywJournal:jnl44580x1435-06617nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2136/sssaj2005.00873Available from publisher's site 7aarticle02708naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002500147245006900172300001600241520158100257592002801838650001001866650001301876650001501889650002001904650001901924650002201943650001601965650002101981650000902002651001902011700001902030700002302049700002502072700002202097773011302119856008102232852000902313655001202322IND60573959420221120102352.0170725e201701  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057395942DNAL7 a10.1007/s00704-015-1627-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEmbolo Embolo, G.

Within this 31-day period, the boundary layer-winds depictions have revealed the West African monsoon’s (WAM) depth (around 1500 m) is not thick enough to trigger intense convection. However, the midlevel winds distribution (700–600 hPa) has shown the average African easterly jet core strength (15 m s⁻¹) is sufficient to allow the development of African easterly waves (AEWs) necessary for squall lines activities. In return, in the upper levels (200–100 hPa), the speed (below 18 m s⁻¹) of the mean Tropical easterly jet (TEJ) core cannot favor midlevel updrafts. The free tropospheric humidity (FTH) depiction has indicated convective events are more likely in the western Sahel where the highest FTH (FTH >50 %) are recorded. The static stability analysis has testified that convection is stronger in the semi-arid (SA) area during night time (0000 GMT). However, convective activities are inhibited in the wet equatorial (WE) region due to mean low-level stability. We used METEOSAT Second Generation (MSG) infrared (IR10.8) imagery of the 8th September 2006 to confirm that result. Furthermore, a maximum midtropospheric static stability combined with maximum relative humidity (RH) was found on the fringe of the Saharan air layer’s (SAL) top (altitude around 5.3 km) in the WE region.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSahel 3aaltitude 3aconvection 3adata collection 3amonsoon season 3arelative humidity 3atroposphere 3aweather stations 3awind 3aWestern Africa1 aLenouo, André1 aNzeukou, Armand T.1 aVondou, Derbetini A.1 aKamga, F.

Ex R.E. Fr.) after drying at different temperatures. Fruits with a water content of 0.38 kg water/kg dry matter were harvested and manually homogenized. Drying was accomplished at 35, 45, 60, 75, and 90°C and at 21,9,7,5, and 2% relative humidity, respectively. After drying, the structure of the pericarp and tegument of the seed were evaluated and the embryo was removed from the fruit/seed for morphological analysis (structural and ultrastructural and the histolocalization of reserve substances). Drying at different temperatures did not affect the cellular structure of the tissues composing the pericarp of the fruits, but it disorganized the structure of the seed tegument. The cells of the tegument and cotyledons presented a contraction in their volumes. The lowest contractions in the cellular volumes of both the tegument and cotyledons occurred after drying at 35 and 45°C. The cytoplasm of the cotyledon cells contains oil drops and the protein bodies contain protein granules and starch grains. There were no changes in the cellular walls of the embryos of the fruits dried at different temperatures; however, ungluing of the medium lamella occurred. This damage occurred with greater intensity after drying at temperatures above 60°C. The form of the oil drops in the cytoplasm of the cotyledon cells was altered after drying. At temperatures above 60°C, the drops broke up and coalesced. After drying at 45 and 60°C, the form of some protein bodies was altered, whereas at 75 and 90°C coalescence of the protein bodies occurred in some cells. It was concluded that the identified alterations can affect the physiologic quality of crambe seeds.  aPublisher supplied data 3aprotein bodies 3astarch granules 3apericarp 3arelative humidity 3aCrambe abyssinica 3acotyledons 3aoils 3aair drying 3adried fruit 3awater content 3atemperature 3aultrastructure 3atissues 0aseeds 0aCrambe 0aDehydration 0aScanning electron microscopy 0aTransmission electron microscopy1 aResende, Osvaldo1 aTeixeira, Simone de Pádua1 aSantos, Jaime Maia dos1 aMoro, Fabíola Vitti0 tDrying technology.g2013 Feb. 17, v. 31, no. 3 p.269-276dTaylor & Francis Groupx1532-23007nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/07373937.2012.724490  aDNAL 7aarticle03078naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100002600141245019300167300001800360500001900378520149200397592002801889650001801917650002801935650002001963650001701983650001502000650001202015650001102027650002002038650001002058650001502068651001102083653001602094653001402110653002102124653001802145653001702163700002402180700002402204700002402228700002202252700002302274700001902297700002502316773014702341856007502488852000902563655001202572IND60725667320221118191616.0210128e20200929xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072566732DNAL7 a10.1093/jee/toaa2192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCarvalho, Sindoval C.10aSpatial Distribution of Frankliniella schultzei (Thysanoptera: Thripidae) in Open-Field Yellow Melon, With Emphasis on the Role of Surrounding Vegetation as a Source of Initial Infestation  ap. 2997-3003.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aFrankliniella schultzei (Trybom) is a serious pest of melon crops and is commonly found in the main producing areas of melon in Brazil (North and Northeast regions). This pest causes significant losses, damaging plants through feeding and tospovirus vectoring. Thus, the proper management of F. schultzei is crucial to prevent economic losses, and knowledge of the within-field distribution patterns of F. schultzei can be used to improve this pest management. This study aimed to determine the within-field distribution (through semivariogram modeling and kriging interpolation) and the factors associated with F. schultzei abundance in open-field yellow melon crops. We surveyed four yellow melon fields located in Formoso do Araguaia (Tocantins state, North Brazil) for thrips abundance in various crop stages (vegetative, flowering, and fruiting) in 2015 and 2016. Twelve models were fitted and it was determined that F. schultzei counts were strongly aggregated. The median spatial dependence was 4.79 m (range 3.55 to 8.02 m). The surface maps generated by kriging depicted an edge effect in fields 3 and 4. In addition, correlation analyses indicated that air temperature and presence of surrounding cucurbits are positively associated with F. schultzei abundance in yellow melon fields. Altogether, these insights can be combined for spatially based pest management, especially when the conditions (cucurbits in the surroundings and warmer periods) are favorable to F. schultzei.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCucurbitaceae 3aFrankliniella schultzei 3aair temperature 3aedge effects 3aentomology 3akriging 3amelons 3apest management 3apests 3avegetation 3aBrazil 0aaggregation 0alandscape 0aordinary kriging 0asemivariogram 0aThysanoptera1 aJunior, Paulo A.

As hydrogen production can be based on a broad variety of technologies already existing or under development, a comprehensive assessment of the different supply chains is necessary regarding not only costs but also diverse environmental impacts. Therefore, in this paper, a broad variety of hydrogen production technologies using different energy sources, renewable and fossil, are exemplarily assessed with the help of a Life Cycle Assessment and a cost assessment for Germany. As environmental impacts, along with the impact category Climate change, five more advanced impact categories are assessed. The results show that from an environmental point of view, PEM and alkaline electrolysis are characterized by the lowest results in five out of six impact categories. Supply chains using fossil fuels, in contrast, have the lowest supply costs; this is true, e.g., for steam methane reforming. Solar powered hydrogen production shows low impacts during hydrogen production but high impacts for transport and distribution to Germany. There is no single supply chain that is the most promising for every aspect assessed here. Either costs have to be lowered further or supply chains with selected environmental impacts have to be modified.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclimate change 3acost analysis 3aelectrolysis 3aenergy 3aenvironmental impact 3afossil fuels 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3agreenhouse gases 3ahydrogen 3ahydrogen production 3alife cycle assessment 3amethane 3asteam 3asupply chain 3aGermany1 aKaltschmitt, Martin0 tSustainability.g2018 May 23, v. 10, no. 6dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2270x2071-10507nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su100616993Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03467naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024003200135040001800167100002400185245014800209300001100357506007600368520142400444592002801868506003701896650002001933650001001953650001501963650001801978650001601996650001602012650001602028650000902044650001302053650002302066650001702089650001102106650001502117650001502132650002302147650000902170650002502179650001302204650001202217650002302229650001602252650001102268650004602279650006802325650000902393650004502402650007802447700002102525700003202546700002402578700002502602773011402627856007902741852000902820655001202829IND50064501220221207092258.0210217e201312  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006450122DNAL7 a234975652pmid7 aPMC36144672pmcid7 a10.1186/1746-6148-9-452doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMarinković, Darko,14aThe role of hepatic myofibroblasts in liver cirrhosis in fallow deer (Dama dama) naturally infected with giant liver fluke (Fascioloides magna)  ap. 45.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: This paper describes liver cirrhosis in 35 fallow deer infected with the giant liver fluke, as well as the distribution, origin, and role of myofibroblasts in its development.

The walls of the bile ducts are thickened, the epithelium multiplied with mucous metaplasia, and desquamated cells, parasite eggs and brown pigment are present in their lumen. In the livers with cirrhosis, immunopositivity to α-SMA and desmin was observed in cells in portal and septal spaces, at the edge between fibrotic septa and the surrounding parenchyma and in perisinusoidal spaces. These cells vary in size, they are round, oval, spindle-shaped or irregular in shape, similar to vascular smooth muscle cells. The derangement of epithelial-mesenchymal interactions detected in chronic cholangiopathies is most probably the pro-fibrogenic mechanism in liver cirrhosis of fallow deer (Dama dama) infected with the giant liver fluke (Fascioloides magna). CONCLUSION: Myofibroblasts, especially hepatic stellate cells (HSCs), play an important role in the synthesis of extracellular matrix components in the development of parasitic fibrosis and cirrhosis in the liver of fallow deer.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aliver cirrhosis 3aliver 3ametaplasia 3asmooth muscle 3alymphocytes 3aCervus dama 3amacrophages 3aeggs 3amyocytes 3aconnective tissues 3aliver flukes 3adesmin 3abile ducts 3aepithelium 3aFascioloides magna 3adeer 3aextracellular matrix 3apigments 2aAnimals 2aDeerxparasitology 2aFasciolidae 2aFemale 2aLiverxcytologyxparasitologyxpathology. 2aLiver Cirrhosisxetiologyxparasitologyxpathologyxveterinary. 2aMale 2aMyofibroblastsxparasitologyxpathology. 2aTrematode Infectionsxcomplicationsxparasitologyxpathologyxveterinary.1 aKukolj, Vladimir1 aAleksić-Kovačević, Sanja1 aJovanović, Milijan1 aKnežević, Milijana0 tBMC veterinary research.g2013 Dec., v. 9, no. 1 p.45-45dBioMed CentralwJournal:jnl4152735x1746-61487nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1746-6148-9-453Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03951naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100002600154245016900180300001600349520230500365592002802670650001902698650002102717650002002738650002102758650001502779650001202794650001002806650001102816650001402827650002202841650001502863650001102878650001502889650002002904650001402924650001302938650000902951650001402960650001702974650001202991651001003003653002503013653002003038653001203058653001503070653001503085653001603100700002503116700001903141700002003160773009503180856008903275852000903364655001203373IND60569247020221122035421.0190319e201707  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056924702DNAL7 a10.1016/j.landusepol.2017.05.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAsante, Winston Adams10aFarmers’ perspectives on climate change manifestations in smallholder cocoa farms and shifts in cropping systems in the forest-savannah transitional zone of Ghana  ap. 374-381.  aThe study was conducted to explore actual manifestations of climate change in smallholder cocoa farms to aid extension response to climate impacts, and to understand the reasons for a renewed interest in cocoa production in the forest-savanna agro ecological landscape in Ghana, in spite of unfavorable climatic conditions. Two hundred cocoa farmers were interviewed in nine cocoa farming communities. Selected farms were also visited to document on-farm manifestation of climate impacts as well as innovations and strategies farmers are employing to respond to the adverse impacts of climate change on their cocoa systems. The results revealed various manifestations of climate impacts on cocoa farms which included, increased incidence of pests and diseases, wilting of cocoa leaves, high mortality of cocoa seedlings which affected expansion and farm rehabilitation, and wilting of cherelles resulting in low yield. The farmers maintained that their response to the immediate impacts of climate on cocoa was a shift to cereals due to the unpredictable climatic patterns and the shortened duration of rainfall. However, a combination of storage and supply chain challenges and low returns from cereal production, coupled with land scarcity in the Western Region, where most of them are migrant farmers accounted for their decision to return to cocoa production lately. It was observed, among other adaptive responses, that some farmers plant about three times the plantain suckers they usually plant, to provide a dense temporary shade over cocoa seedlings, and resort to planting more cocoa seedlings randomly per unit area on new farms, contrary to recommended planting approach, as a form of insurance against seedling mortality. More importantly, a community-based fire response system was identified to be a major safeguard mechanism to the threat of fire. Clearly, the farmers are not replanting cocoa in the forest-savanna agro ecological landscape because it is more productive than cereals, but they believe that a low yielding cocoa is far better than a productive cereal cropping systems that offer low returns when compared to cocoa. The study brings out the sustainable livelihood challenges of the rural farmer within the context of a changing climate for appropriate policy response.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclimate change 3aclimatic factors 3acrop production 3acropping systems 3afarm labor 3afarmers 3afarms 3agrains 3ainsurance 3aissues and policy 3alandscapes 3aleaves 3alivelihood 3amigrant workers 3amortality 3aplanting 3arain 3aseedlings 3asupply chain 3awilting 3aGhana 0aAgro-ecological zone 0aTheobroma cacao 0aLanduse 0aAdaptation 0aLivelihood 0aSmallholder1 aAcheampong, Emmanuel1 aKyereh, Edward1 aKyereh, Boateng0 tLand use policy.g2017 July, v. 66 p.374-381dElsevier LtdwJournal:12412x0264-83777nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.landusepol.2017.05.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01313naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001700149245015200166300001600318520035300334592002800687650001100715650002300726650002200749650001400771700002200785700001900807773010300826856008500929852000901014655001201023IND60579190520221120170130.0170816e20160115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057919052DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.orglett.5b034462doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKano, Taichi10aSynthesis of N-Boc-Propargylic and Allylic Amines by Reaction of Organomagnesium Reagents with N-Boc-Aminals and Their Oxidation to N-Boc-Ketimines  ap. 276-279.  aPreviously inaccessible N-Boc-protected propargylic and allylic amines were synthesized by the reaction between N-Boc-aminals and organomagnesium reagents through the in situ generated N-Boc-imine intermediates.

Due to that, a Regional Climate Model (RegCM) dataset was tested. The Most Unstable Convective Available Potential Energy index value (MUCAPE) above the 200 J kg⁻¹ threshold was selected as a predictor describing favorable conditions for the occurrence of thunderstorms. The quality of the dataset was examined through a comparison between model results and soundings from several aerological stations in Central Europe. Good, statistically significant (0.05 significance level) results were obtained through correlation analysis; the value of Pearson’s correlation coefficient was above 0.8 in every single case. Then, using methods associated with gridded climatology, data series for 44 weather stations were derived and an analysis of correlation between RegCM modeled data and in situ thunderstorm observations was conducted with coefficients in the range of 0.75–0.90. The possibility of employing the dataset in thunderstorm climatology analysis was checked via a few examples by mapping monthly, seasonal, and annual means. Moreover, long-term variability and trend analysis along with modeled MUCAPE data were tested. As a result, the RegCM modeled MUCAPE gridded dataset was proposed as an easily available, suitable, and valuable predictor for thunderstorm climatology analysis and mapping. Finally, some limitations are discussed and recommendations for further improvements are given.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclimate models 3aclimatology 3aconvective available potential energy 3acorrelation 3adata collection 3astorms 3aweather stations 3aCentral European region1 aKielar, Rafał1 aUstrnul, Zbigniew0 tTheoretical and applied climatology.g2017 Jan., v. 127, no. 1-2 p.229-240dSpringer Viennax0177-798X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00704-015-1620-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01186naa a2200229 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100001800112245005600130300001300186520051400199592002800713650002700741650001600768651001200784651001200796773012700808852000900935655001200944IND60300898220221122134719.0150703e20130322xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6030089822DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWald, Chelsea10aAustrian Academy of Sciences Faces Its Nazi History  ap. 1368.  aAfter the end of World War II, the Austrian Academy of Sciences officially suspended members who had joined the Nazi Party—but it quickly reinstated nearly every one.

We highlight key aspects of weed ecology and evolutionary biology that can help to test and recast ecological and evolutionary laws in a changing world.

This effect was ascribed to a stabilizing interaction in the transition state due to the lone pair of the heterocyclic nitrogen with the α carbon. Computational support for this hypothesis came from CCSD(T)/6-31+G(d) calculations.

Conversely, endophytic bacteria can be used to prevent plant diseases and increase crop yield. The nodule endophytic bacterium Pseudomonas fragi (Eichholz) Gruber has been reported to promote crop growth, but its role in nematode control is unclear. In this study, the biocontrol effect of P. fragi Sneb1990 against Meloidogyne incognita (Kofoid & White) Chitwood was assessed in tomato (Solanum lycopersicum L.). In vitro, the fermentation broth of P. fragi Sneb1990 provoked 76.8% juvenile mortality after 48 h and 71.9% egg mortality after 7 d. P. fragi Sneb1990 promoted plant growth and alleviated M. incognita disease symptoms in pot and field experiments. The split-root assay revealed that P. fragi Sneb1990 stimulated local and systemic immunity to suppress the penetration and development of M. incognita and that it enhanced the expression of PR1, PR2, PR3, PR5, and PDF1.2, which participate in the jasmonic acid and salicylic acid pathways. Furthermore, the flagellin polypeptide flg22 of P. fragi Sneb1990 triggered tomato immunity against M. incognita, stimulated reactive oxygen species production, and upregulated the expression of salicylic acid resistance-related genes. This is the first report of the suppression of M. incognita infection by the nodule endophyte P. fragi. In addition, the flagellin functional domain of P. fragi Sneb1990 triggered immune responses against M. incognita in tomato. Overall, our study highlights the potential of P. fragi Sneb1990 as a biocontrol agent against M. incognita.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMeloidogyne incognita 3aPseudomonas fragi 3aSolanum lycopersicum 3abacteria 3abiological control 3abiological control agents 3acrop yield 3aculture media 3aeggs 3aendophytes 3aflagellin 3aimmune response 3ajasmonic acid 3ajuveniles 3amortality 3anematode control 3aplant growth 3apolypeptides 3areactive oxygen species 3aroot-knot nematodes 3asalicylic acid 3atomatoes 0aNodule endophytic bacterium 0aTriggered immunity 0aTomato1 aFan, Haiyan1 aZhao, Di1 aZhu, Xiaofeng1 aWang, Yuanyuan1 aLiu, Xiaoyu1 aLiu, Dan1 aDuan, Yuxi1 aChen, Lijie0 tBiological control.g2021 Dec., v. 164 p.104773-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl48419x1049-96447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biocontrol.2021.1047733Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02858naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002200145245008700167520133800254592002801592650001301620650001701633650001201650650002501662650001801687650002001705650001001725650002201735650002401757650002901781650001301810650002201823650002001845650001701865650002401882650002001906650001701926651001901943700002401962700001901986700002002005700002002025700002002045700002102065700002602086700001802112773012202130856007902252852000902331655001202340IND60676985220221117223232.0191122e20191112xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067698522DNAL7 a10.3390/agronomy91107472doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBrtnicky, Martin 10aLong-Term Effects of Biochar-Based Organic Amendments on Soil Microbial Parameters  aBiochar application to the soil has been recommended as a carbon (C) management approach to sequester C and improve soil quality. Three-year experiments were conducted to investigate the interactive effects of three types of amendments on microbial biomass carbon, soil dehydrogenase activity and soil microbial community abundance in luvisols of arable land in the Czech Republic. Four different treatments were studied, which were, only NPK as a control, NPK + cattle manure, NPK + biochar and NPK + combination of manure with biochar. The results demonstrate that all amendments were effective in increasing the fungal and bacterial biomass, as is evident from the increased values of bacterial and fungal phospholipid fatty acid analysis. The ammonia-oxidizing bacteria population increases with the application of biochar, and it reaches its maximum value when biochar is applied in combination with manure. The overall results suggest that co-application of biochar with manure changes soil properties in favor of increased microbial biomass. It was confirmed that the application of biochar might increase or decrease soil activity, but its addition, along with manure, always promotes microbial abundance and their activity. The obtained results can be used in the planning and execution of the biochar-based soil amendments.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLuvisols 3aarable soils 3abiochar 3acarbon sequestration 3acattle manure 3aenzyme activity 3afungi 3along term effects 3anitrifying bacteria 3aphospholipid fatty acids 3aplanning 3apopulation growth 3asoil amendments 3asoil enzymes 3asoil microorganisms 3asoil properties 3asoil quality 3aCzech Republic1 aDokulilova, Tereza 1 aHolatko, Jiri 1 aPecina, Vaclav 1 aKintl, Antonin 1 aLatal, Oldrich 1 aVyhnanek, Tomas 1 aPrichystalova, Jitka 1 aDatta, Rahul 0 tAgronomy.g2019 Nov. 12, v. 9, no. 11dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:12361x2073-43957nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agronomy91107473Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02117naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001600140245010400156300001600260520093000276592002801206650001901234650002501253650001001278650002201288650001401310650002101324650001901345650001201364650001501376650001201391650001301403650001301416700001501429700001401444700001101458700001701469773013801486856007401624852000901698655001201707IND60683268420221119190800.0200207e20200205xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068326842DNAL7 a10.1039/c9tb02515d2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShan, Liang10aRecent advances in heparinization of polymeric membranes for enhanced continuous blood purification  ap. 878-894.  aContinuous blood purification technology such as hemodiafiltration has been used worldwide for saving patients suffering from severe diseases or organ function failure, especially in the intensive care unit and emergency setting. The filters as core devices are commonly made of polymer materials as hollow fiber membranes. However, the membrane is often inductively blocked by blood clot formation due to its interactions with blood components. Heparin is the anticoagulant often used in clinical practice for anti-coagulation. Recently, heparin is also employed to modify the hollow fiber membranes either chemically or physically to improve the filtration performance. This review summarizes recent advances in methodology for surface heparinization of such hollow fiber membranes, and their filtration performance improvement. The review also provides expert opinions for further research in this rapidly expanding field.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanticoagulants 3aartificial membranes 3ablood 3ablood coagulation 3achemistry 3adisease severity 3aexpert opinion 3afilters 3afiltration 3aheparin 3apatients 3apolymers1 aSun, Yunbo1 aShanfeng,1 aLi, Li1 aXu, Zhi Ping0 tJournal of materials chemistry B.g2020 Feb. 5, v. 8, no. 5 p.878-894dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26902x2050-75187nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c9tb02515d3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02600naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001700140245012800157300002000285520122000305592002801525650000801553650001401561650001101575650001401586650002301600650001301623650001501636650002101651650001501672650001301687650001801700650001801718650001701736650001501753700001501768700001801783700001301801700001601814700001601830700001101846700001701857700001701874773014401891856007402035852000902109655001202118IND60707039620221116220831.0200812e20200811xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070703962DNAL7 a10.1039/d0ta01437k2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhao, Weiyue10aMesoporous carbon confined intermetallic nanoparticles as highly durable electrocatalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction  ap. 15822-15828.  aExploring advanced electrocatalysts for the sluggish oxygen reduction reaction is extremely important for fuel cell commercialization but still remains a great challenge, especially the durability issue that gains increasing attention. Herein, we demonstrate an extremely durable catalyst prototype that combines structurally ordered intermetallic nanoparticles (NPs) with mesoporous carbon. With ZIF-8 derived mesoporous carbon supported Pt₃Co intermetallic NPs (Pt₃Co/DMC-F) as an example, we illustrate its synthetic details, electrocatalytic performance and durability enhancement mechanism. The Pt₃Co/DMC-F catalyst exhibited significant enhancement in activity and durability. More importantly, its extraordinary performance was observed/verified in a H₂/air PEM single cell test. The confinement of mesoporous carbon not only efficiently controls the particle size of Pt₃Co and hampers their aggregation during thermal annealing and electrochemical reactions, but also significantly suppresses detachment. Beyond offering an advanced electrocatalyst, this study provides a solution to the durability issue of cathodes that has prevented practical application of proton exchange membrane fuel cells.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3aannealing 3acarbon 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3acathodes 3adurability 3aelectrochemistry 3afuel cells 3ahydrogen 3ananoparticles 3aparticle size 3aporous media 3aprototypes1 aYe, Yuekun1 aJiang, Wenjie1 aLi, Jing1 aTang, Haibo1 aHu, Jinsong1 aDu, Li1 aCui, Zhiming1 aLiao, Shijun0 tJournal of materials chemistry A.g2020 Aug. 11, v. 8, no. 31 p.15822-15828dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26903x2050-74967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d0ta01437k3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04341naa a2200745 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024003300135040001800168100001900186245015100205300001200356500001500368506007600383520200100459592002802460506003702488650001002525650001902535650001002554650001102564650002402575650001602599650002302615650001002638650001702648650002202665650002102687650002002708650001402728650003502742650001102777650002202788650001202810650001602822650001102838650002302849650004402872650002102916650001102937650004002948650002002988650001903008650002603027650004103053650005903094650001603153650001703169650003703186650001703223650001303240650001203253653001503265700001803280700002603298700002303324700002003347773016103367856004603528852000903574655001203583IND50060704220221207124648.0140121e201212  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006070422DNAL7 a229543862pmid7 aPMC34909782pmcid7 a10.1186/1479-5868-9-1052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHill, Jennie L10aDoes availability of physical activity and food outlets differ by race and income? Findings from an enumeration study in a health disparate region  ap. 637.  a2019-12-06  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: Low-income, ethnic/racial minorities and rural populations are at increased risk for obesity and related chronic health conditions when compared to white, urban and higher-socio-economic status (SES) peers. Recent systematic reviews highlight the influence of the built environment on obesity, yet very few of these studies consider rural areas or populations. Utilizing a CBPR process, this study advances community-driven causal models to address obesity by exploring the difference in resources for physical activity and food outlets by block group race and income in a small regional city that anchors a rural health disparate region. To guide this inquiry we hypothesized that lower income and racially diverse block groups would have fewer food outlets, including fewer grocery stores and fewer physical activity outlets. We further hypothesized that walkability, as defined by a computed walkability index, would be lower in the lower income block groups. METHODS: Using census data and GIS, base maps of the region were created and block groups categorized by income and race. All food outlets and physical activity resources were enumerated and geocoded and a walkability index computed. Analyses included one-way MANOVA and spatial autocorrelation. RESULTS: In total, 49 stores, 160 restaurants and 79 physical activity outlets were enumerated. There were no differences in the number of outlets by block group income or race. Further, spatial analyses suggest that the distribution of outlets is dispersed across all block groups. CONCLUSIONS: Under the larger CPBR process, this enumeration study advances the causal models set forth by the community members to address obesity by providing an overview of the food and physical activity environment in this region. This data reflects the food and physical activity resources available to residents in the region and will aid many of the community-academic partners as they pursue intervention strategies targeting obesity.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3apeers 3agrocery stores 3afoods 3aincome 3aminorities (people) 3acensus data 3aat-risk population 3araces 3arural health 3aphysical activity 3arural population 3aautocorrelation 3abase maps 3ageographic information systems 3amodels 3asystematic review 3aobesity 3arestaurants 3acities 2aEnvironment Design 2aEthnicityxstatistics & numerical data. 2aHealth Promotion 2aHumans 2aIncomexstatistics & numerical data 2aMinority Groups 2aMotor Activity 2aObesityxepidemiology 2aPovertyxstatistics & numerical data 2aResidence Characteristicsxstatistics & numerical data 2aRestaurants 2aRisk Factors 2aRural Populationxclassification 2aSocial Class 2aSoftware 2aWalking 0aminorities1 aChau, Clarice1 aLuebbering, Candice R1 aKolivras, Korine K1 aZoellner, Jamie0 tinternational journal of behavioral nutrition and physical activity.g2012 Dec., v. 9, no. 1 p.637-637dSpringer-VerlagwJournal:jnl4350546x1479-58687nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1479-5868-9-105  aDNAL 7aarticle04280naa a2200721 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100005400140245014800194500002000342520200700362592002802369650001302397650001102410650002102421650001802442650002502460650001702485650001602502650001202518650003602530650002102566650002002587650001302607650001102620650002102631650003002652650002002682650001202702650001902714650001902733650001202752650002302764650001002787650002802797650001902825650002802844650001802872650001902890650001302909650000902922650005802931650002002989650001703009650002503026650001803051650001403069700002103083700003103104700006103135700002103196700001603217700001703233700006603250700001903316773012803335856007403463852000903537655001203546IND60674679820221121234316.0191029e201911  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067467982DNAL7 a10.1111/jfbc.130302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEkin, Suat1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6502-502810aNephroprotective effect of Ferulago angulata flowers on N‐nitrosodimethylamine‐induced nephrotoxicity in rats and its phytochemical profile  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe present study was designed to assess the phytochemical content of Ferulago angulata (FA) and possible in vivo nephroprotective effect of FA administration on trace elements, minerals, MDA and GSH in kidney and liver tissue samples, serum vitamin (α‐tocopherol, retinol, cholecalciferol, phylloquinone), TSA, and LSA in a rat model of DMN‐induced nephrotoxicity. In the study, Wistar albino rats were assigned to six groups: Control (0.9% NaCl), (DMN 10 mg/kg), (FA 150 mg/kg), (DMN + FA 150 mg/kg), (FA 300 mg/kg), and (DMN + FA 300 mg/kg). Rats were intraperitoneally given DMN for the first 7 days. Renal injury caused by DMN was proved by the histopathological alterations. The FA (300 mg/kg) treatment significantly normalized Se, Cr, Ca levels in liver and Co level in kidney tissue samples. These observed positive effects are due to the phytochemical content of the plant. The flower extract of FA (300 mg/kg) can be used for the prevention of kidney damage. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: Ferulago angulata flowers are used in traditional medicine for treat kidney and liver digestive system diseases. This species is endemic taxa of the family Apiaceae, which has been used both as food and therapeutics because of their phytochemical composition. In this study, the phenolic characterization of FA flower was used to a new RP‐HPLC method, as well as the biological activity of FA flower and possible in vivo nephroprotective effect of FA flowers on trace elements, minerals, MDA and GSH in kidney and liver tissue samples and vitamins, TSA, and LSA in serum samples a rat model of DMN‐induced nephrotoxicity. It was found that high level of phenolic compounds (chlorogenic acid, vanillic acid, 2‐hydroxycinnamic acid) present in the flower extract of F. angulata has positive effects and antioxidant properties. Due to its phenolic content, FA flower extract could protect for kidney damage and can be used as antioxidants in the food additive and pharmaceutical industry.  aPublisher supplied data 3aApiaceae 3aalbino 3aalpha-tocopherol 3aanimal models 3aantioxidant activity 3aantioxidants 3ablood serum 3acalcium 3achemical constituents of plants 3achlorogenic acid 3acholecalciferol 3achromium 3acobalt 3adietary minerals 3adigestive system diseases 3aflower extracts 3aflowers 3afood additives 3ahistopathology 3akidneys 3alaboratory animals 3aliver 3anephroprotective effect 3anephrotoxicity 3apharmaceutical industry 3aphylloquinone 3aphytochemicals 3aquinones 3arats 3areversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography 3asodium chloride 3atherapeutics 3atraditional medicine 3avanillic acid 3avitamin A1 aKiziltas, Hatice1 aBayramoglu Akkoyun, Mahire1 aEkin, Hasya Nazli1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4115-75091 aYildirim, Serkan1 aOto, Gokhan1 aAkbas, Esvet1 aDeliorman Orhan, Didem1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3916-40481 aOzgokce, Fevzi0 tJournal of food biochemistry.g2019 Nov., v. 43, no. 11 p.e13030-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl8484x0145-88847nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jfbc.130303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01956naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002400150245017600174300001400350520059900364592002800963650001400991650001801005650002801023650001201051650001701063650003001080650002201110653001801132653002501150653001901175653003101194653003101225700005801256700002001314700002401334773010601358856008501464852000901549655001201558IND60633256620221122061415.0210527e20190301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063325662DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carres.2019.02.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVerma, Ashish Kumar10aSynthesis of di- and trihydroxy proline derivatives from D-glycals: Application in the synthesis of polysubstituted pyrrolizidines and bioactive 1C-aryl/alkyl pyrrolidines  ap. 48-55.  aSix different types of O-benzyl protected proline derivatives have been synthesized from D-glycals and 2C-formyl-glycals.

However, three works reported that CUR exhibits lethal and teratogenic effects on zebrafish embryos. Also, CUR is insoluble and unstable in aqueous media, so it needs to be protected for its incorporation in food or medicine.The effects of free CUR and dendrimer-complexed CUR (CUR-DG4.0 and CUR-DG4.5) on the viability, the spontaneous movement, the heart rate, the morphological changes, and the hepatic-state of zebrafish larvae were deeply studied.The CUR reduced the viability, caused malformations, and showed neurotoxic, cardiotoxic and hepatotoxic effects in sub-lethal concentrations. The CUR-DG4.0 complexes exacerbated the toxicity due to a synergism effect induced by cationic dendrimers and an increase in the uptake of CUR by larvae. The CUR-DG4.5 complexes reduced the toxics effects of CUR, without modified its uptake, showing an important hepatoprotective effect.This work showed for the first time that CUR present tissue-specific toxic effects in zebrafish larvae, and that CUR-treated zebrafish larvae could be used as a model for studying the hepatoprotective action of other drugs and nanomaterials.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDanio rerio 3aabnormal development 3aanimal models 3abioactive compounds 3acurcumin 3adendrimers 3adrugs 3adyes 3aembryo (animal) 3afish larvae 3aheart rate 3ahepatoprotective effect 3ahepatotoxicity 3ahumans 3aneurotoxicity 3apolyphenols 3asynergism 3ateratogenicity 3aviability 0aCUR 0aD 0aDG4.0 0aDG4.5 0aDMSO 0adpf 0ahpf 0ahpi 0aLC50 0aPAMAM 0aPBS 0aCurcumin 0aPAMAM dendrimers 0aZebrafish larvae 0aToxicity assessment1 aMartinez, Carolina S.1 aAlonso, Silvia del V.1 aChiaramoni, Nadia S.1 aPrieto, M.

Such knowledge is required to estimate the performance of a wind energy project in the area. This study investigates the wind energy potential for production of electric power in the Peninsular Malaysia. Wind speed data of six selected sites across the country collected over a period of 10–20years are employed for the study. A statistical analysis of the wind speeds is carried out using the Weibull distribution model. Six identified commercially available wind turbines with rated capacity ranging from 20kW to 1500kW, with different speed parameters are simulated at the selected locations. Of the six sites evaluated in this paper, it is revealed that Mersing, having the highest monthly average wind speed and consequently the most viable, produces an average power density of 57.58W/m² with a capacity factor of only 4.39%. This is equivalent to 378MWh energy production per annum at a levelised cost of 22cents per kWh. This study also shows that the standard deviation of the average monthly wind speeds is a better factor than the average annual wind speed for ranking of selected sites in terms of annual energy production. Overall, the results obtained from this investigation show that large-scale wind energy is not viable in Malaysia due to weak wind regimes; however, small-scale wind energy system may be economically viable in a few regions most especially when the recently launched feed-in tariff in the country is extended to wind energy.  aPublisher supplied data 3aelectric power 3aenergy conversion 3amodels 3astatistical analysis 3atariffs 3awind power 3awind speed 3awind turbines 3aMalaysia1 aMohd Rashid, Muhd Ikram1 aSulaiman, Mohd.

In response to chilling stress, increment of phospholipase D (PLD) enzyme activity leads to releasing unsaturated fatty acids, which under peroxidation by lipoxygenase (LOX) results to declining membrane fluidity and manifesting chilling symptoms. In this study, the effects of γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) treatment applied by preharvest spraying (1mM) or postharvest stem-end dipping (5mM, 15min at 20°C) on CI of anthurium cut flowers (cv. Sirion) stored at 4°C for 21 days were investigated. GABA treatment at 1 and 5mM by pre and postharvest treatment, respectively, significantly delayed spathe browning. The GABA treated anthurium cut flowers exhibited significantly lower PLD and LOX activities, which coincided with a higher unsaturated fatty acids/saturated fatty acids (unSFA/SFA) ratio. Also, anthurium cut flowers treated with GABA showed lower H2O2 accumulation, which results from higher antioxidant enzymes superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), ascorbate peroxidase (APX), and glutathione reductase (GR) activity. These results suggest that GABA treatment can be used as a useful procedure for enhancing tolerance of anthurium cut flowers to postharvest chilling injury by decreasing PLD and LOX activities coincide with enhancing antioxidant system activity, which lead to lowering ROS accumulation and promoting higher unSFA/SFA ratio and ultimately maintaining membrane integrity.  aPublisher supplied data 3amembrane fluidity 3adipping 3aascorbate peroxidase 3aunsaturated fatty acids 3arisk 3achilling injury 3ahydrogen peroxide 3asaturated fatty acids 3aperoxidation 3apostharvest treatment 3aAnthurium 3alinoleate 13S-lipoxygenase 3asuperoxide dismutase 3acut flowers 3agamma-aminobutyric acid 3aenzyme activity 3atemperature 3aspraying 3aglutathione-disulfide reductase 3acatalase 3acold stress 3aflowers 3acold treatment 3acold tolerance 3aphospholipase D 0aγ-Aminobutyric acid 0aChilling injury 0aAnthurium cut flowers 0aLipoxygenase 0aPhospholipase D 0aantioxidants 0aPostharvest 0aAntioxidant system 0alipoxygenase1 aNaderi, Roohangiz1 aJannatizadeh, Abbasali1 aSarcheshmeh, Mohammad Ali Askari1 aBabalar, Mesbah0 tScientia horticulturae.g2016 Jan. 26, v. 198 p.52-60dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4108x0304-42387nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scienta.2015.11.0193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03496naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002100148245009100169300001300260520213500273592002802408650001902436650001102455650001202466650002002478650001602498650001402514650002002528650001202548650001602560650001302576650001502589650001602604650001302620650001602633651001102649653002402660653001602684653001302700653001402713653001902727700002302746700002402769700001802793773010002811856008202911852000902993655001203002IND60567190720221121080712.0190402e201707  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056719072DNAL7 a10.1016/j.agsy.2017.04.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBattisti, Rafael10aGauging the sources of uncertainty in soybean yield simulations using the MONICA model  ap. 9-18.  aCrop models are an important tool to evaluate crop management strategies and simulate yield for present and future scenarios, however, much uncertainty is present within model parameters, approaches and input variables. Therefore, it is important to quantify the uncertainties in simulated yields as a function of input details from field management decisions and their effect on simulated regional soybean yield. To investigate this, the Model for Nitrogen and Carbon in Agroecosystems (MONICA), calibrated with experimental data, was used in this study. Four sources of uncertainty relevant to field management were considered in simulating soybean yields: technological level, soil type, sowing date and cultivar maturity group. The uncertainties in yield simulation were investigated for 14 sites in Southern Brazil, comparing results to governmental statistics for the crop seasons from 1989/1990 to 2013/2014. The MONICA model was able to simulated soybean grain yield efficiently after calibration of crop phases, growth and root-development parameters. The technological level (TL) was the yield factor with the highest coefficient of variation (CV) among the fourteen sites, with an average of 31.4%, while cultivar maturity group and sowing date both had a CV of 10%, and soil 4.4%. However, uncertainties varied with climate conditions in each crop season, with sowing date and cultivar maturity group both showing higher CV than technological level in some crop seasons. In some cases, for regional yield level, the model demonstrated varied performance by location. The most accurate performance was in simulating yields in the municipality of Passo Fundo (r=0.87), while in Bagé, the lowest accuracy was achieved (r=0.07), across all factors. However, in Bagé, when the lower yields simulated by MONICA, for all source of uncertainties were considered, simulated yields were close to those observed for most of the crop seasons. Based on these results, it is important to consider these different sources of uncertainty that stem from farmer decision-making in order to simulate regional soybean yield efficiently.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagroecosystems 3acarbon 3aclimate 3acrop management 3acrop models 3acultivars 3adecision making 3afarmers 3agrain yield 3anitrogen 3asoil types 3asowing date 3asoybeans 3auncertainty 3aBrazil 0aTechnological level 0aSowing date 0aCultivar 0aSoil type 0aRegional yield1 aParker, Phillip S.1 aSentelhas, Paulo C.1 aNendel, Claas0 tAgricultural systems.g2017 July, v. 155 p.9-18dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl7186x0308-521X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agsy.2017.04.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02467naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245011000168300001600278520098600294592002801280650002201308650002301330650002201353650001701375650003701392650000901429650001501438650001701453650001801470650001801488650001201506650003301518650001101551650001701562650003301579650001801612653002901630653001801659653002701677653002001704653002001724700001701744700002001761773009901781856008401880852000901964655001201973IND60601121820221117200240.0180706e201403  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060112182DNAL7 a10.1016/j.powtec.2014.01.0372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNajafi, Nasim10aHydrothermal synthesis of nanosized SAPO-34 molecular sieves by different combinations of multi templates  ap. 324-330.  aIn the present study, the silicoaluminophosphate (SAPO-34) nanoparticles were synthesized under hydrothermal conditions in the presence of a single or a mixture of tetraethyl ammonium hydroxide (TEAOH), morpholine, diethylamine (DEA) and triethylamine (TEA) as structure-directing agents (SDAs).

No-tillage has been gaining ground as a successful conservation practice, and quantifying spatial variability of soil physical properties induced by no-tillage practices is a prerequisite for making appropriate site-specific agricultural management decisions and/or reformulating some management practices. In particular, there remains very limited information on the spatial variability of soil physical properties under long-term no-tillage corn and tropical soil conditions. Therefore, the main objective of this study was to quantify the spatial variability of some selected soil physical properties (soil surface temperature (ST), volumetric water content (&theta;<inf>v</inf>), soil resistance (TIP), total porosity (&theta;<inf>t</inf>), bulk density (&rho;<inf>b</inf>), organic carbon, and saturated hydraulic conductivity (K<inf>sat</inf>)) using classical and geostatistical methods. The study site was a 2 ha field cropped no-tillage sweet corn for nearly 10 years on Oahu, Hawaii. The field was divided into 10 &times; 10 and 20 &times; 20 m grids. Soil samples were collected at each grid for measuring &rho;<inf>b</inf>, &theta;<inf>t</inf>, and soil organic carbon (SOC) in the laboratory following standard methods. Saturated hydraulic conductivity, TIP at 10 and 20 cm depths, soil surface temperature, and &theta;<inf>v</inf> were also measured. Porosity and &rho;<inf>b</inf> have low and low to moderate variability, respectively based on the relative ranking of the magnitude of variability drawn from the coefficient of variation. Variability of the SOC, TIP, and K<inf>sat</inf> ranges from moderate to high. Based on the best-fitted semivariogram model for finer grid data, 9.8 m and 142.2 m are the cut off beyond which the measured parameter does not show any spatial correlation for SOC, and TIP at 10 cm depth, respectively. Bulk density shows the highest spatial dependence (range = 226.8 m) among all measured properties. Spatial distribution of the soil properties based on kriging shows a high level of variability even though the sampled field is relatively small.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural land 3aagricultural management 3aanthropogenic activities 3abulk density 3aconservation practices 3acorn 3ageostatistics 3akriging 3amodels 3ano-tillage 3aporosity 3asaturated hydraulic conductivity 3asoil organic carbon 3asoil quality 3asoil sampling 3asurface temperature 3asweetcorn 3atropical soils 3avolumetric water content 3aOahu1 aSafeeq, Mohammad 1 aAbbas, Farhat 1 aFares, Samira 1 aDeb, Sanjit  K.1 aAhmad, Amjad 1 aFares, Ali 0 tAgronomy.g2019 Nov. 13, v. 9, no. 11dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:12361x2073-43957nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agronomy91107503Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03371naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002300151245014500174300001600319520176300335592002802098650002002126650001502146650001902161650002502180650001602205650002602221650001602247650001102263650001102274650002402285650001102309650001502320650001602335650001802351650002602369650001802395650001502413650001002428653002502438653001102463653001602474653002402490653000902514653001702523700001402540700001602554700002302570700002002593773010902613856008602722852000902808655001202817IND60525867220221116162235.0190319e20160126xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052586722DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scienta.2015.11.0202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHajebi, Abdolhamid10aHerbicides tank-mixes effects on weeds and productivity and profitability of chilli (Capsicum annuum L.) under conventional and zero tillage  ap. 191-196.  aWeeds heavily infest chilli and cause significant yield losses. Herbicide mixtures control diverse weeds better and prevent/delay weed shift and resistance. They have been hardly studied in chilli under conservation agriculture. Pendimethalin is the prevalent herbicide used in chilli, but not effective against nutsedge. Oxyfluorfen and quizalofop-p-ethyl also have negligible/no effect on nutsedge. Imazethapyr is a post-emergence herbicide and more effective against nutsedge, but its pre-emergence activity against nutsedge/weeds and selectivity to chilli have not been studied. In this study, these herbicides were tank-mixed or sequentially applied to expand the weed spectrum being currently controlled. Our objective was to compare herbicide mixes to improve weed control, especially with nutsedge. We observed that the pre-emergence tank-mix application of pendimethalin 0.75kgha−1+imazethapyr 0.075kgha−1 resulted in significantly higher weed control efficacy (∼86%) and leaf chlorophyll, but lower ascorbate peroxidase activity, suggesting that imazethapyr was selective to chilli. In this treatment, the yield and gross returns were 2% lower, but the net returns and net returns:cost were higher by 3% and 20%, respectively compared to weed-free check that included the costs of hand weeding. The zero tillage with residue (ZT+R) did not affect herbicide activity. The pendimethalin+imazethapyr tank-mix treatment with ZT+R would provide higher yield and income through better weed management and less/no chances for nutsedge insurgence, which usually occurs due to continuous use of herbicides with limited efficacy on nutsedge. It would reduce application cost by 50%, and doses and residues of these herbicides by 25% in agro-ecosystems.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCapsicum annuum 3aCyperaceae 3aagroecosystems 3aascorbate peroxidase 3achlorophyll 3aherbicidal properties 3aimazethapyr 3aincome 3aleaves 3amanual weed control 3amixing 3ano-tillage 3aoxyfluorfen 3apendimethalin 3apesticide application 3aprofitability 3aquizalofop 3aweeds 0aAscorbate peroxidase 0aChilli 0aImazethapyr 0aTank-mix herbicides 0aWeed 0aZero tillage1 aDas, T.K.1 aArora, Ajay1 aSingh, Shashi Bala1 aHajebi, Fatemeh0 tScientia horticulturae.g2016 Jan. 26, v. 198 p.191-196dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4108x0304-42387nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scienta.2015.11.0203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03859naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024003500135040001800170100002000188245011600208300001100324506007600335520203500411592002802446596005502474596005502529506003702584650003002621650002002651650001502671650000902686650001302695650001402708650002402722650001402746650001002760650001902770650001102789650002202800650003102822650002002853650001302873651001102886651001802897700001902915700002302934700001902957700002102976700001702997700001903014700001903033700001803052773010803070856008203178852000903260655001203269IND60586099620221207061924.0220112e201712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058609962DNAL7 a291676952pmid7 aPMC56886662pmcid7 a10.1186/s12986-017-0226-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKomura, Keisuke10aTotal energy expenditure of 10- to 12-year-old Japanese children measured using the doubly labeled water method  ap. 70.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: To establish Japanese children’s estimated energy requirements, total energy expenditure (TEE) data measured using the doubly labeled water (DLW) method is needed. This study aimed to 1) obtain basic TEE data from Japanese children measured using DLW (TEEDLW), 2) compare TEEDLW with TEE estimated by various estimation formulas to calculate their accuracy, and 3) develop a new equation to estimate TEE using body composition and pedometers. METHODS: TEE was measured using DLW in 56 10- to 12-year-old Japanese children (33 boys, 23 girls). Physical activity level (PAL) was calculated by dividing TEEDLW by estimated resting energy expenditure. To assess their physical activity, participants wore pedometers during the 7-d DLW period. Total body water was calculated from ²H and ¹⁸O; fat-free mass (FFM) and fat mass (FM) were then determined. RESULTS: In boys and girls of normal weight, TEEDLW was 2067 ± 230 kcal/d and 1830 ± 262 kcal/d, respectively. Average PAL was 1.58 ± 0.17. FFM was strongly related to TEE (r = 0.702, p < 0.01). After adjusting for FFM and FM, step count was significantly associated with TEE (r = 0.707, p < 0.01). The TEE estimation formula used in the Dietary Reference Intakes (DRI) for the United States and Canada estimated TEEDLW with high accuracy (bias: 2.0%) in both sexes. We developed new equations for TEE consisting of FFM and step count, which accounted for 68% and 65% of TEE variance in boys and girls, respectively: boys, 47.1 × FFM (kg) + 0.0568 × step count (steps/d) – 122, and girls, 55.5 × FFM (kg) + 0.0315 × step count (steps/d) - 117. CONCLUSIONS: The TEE in 10- to 12-year-old Japanese children measured using DLW was approximately 7% lower for boys and 12% lower for girls compared to the current Japanese DRI. If PAL can be accurately determined, the equation in the DRI for the United States and Canada may be applicable to Japanese children. In addition, TEE could be predicted using FFM and step count.  aPublisher supplied data  a18300197cGrant-in-Aid for Scientific Research (B)  a20300219cGrant-in-Aid for Scientific Research (B)0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDietary Reference Intakes 3aJapanese people 3abody water 3aboys 3achildren 3adeuterium 3aenergy requirements 3aequations 3agirls 3alean body mass 3aoxygen 3aphysical activity 3aresting energy expenditure 3astable isotopes 3avariance 3aCanada 3aUnited States1 aNakae, Satoshi1 aHirakawa, Kazufumi1 aEbine, Naoyuki1 aSuzuki, Kazuhiro1 aOzawa, Haruo1 aYamada, Yosuke1 aKimura, Misaka1 aIshii, Kojiro0 tNutrition & metabolism.g2017 Dec., v. 14, no. 1 p.70-70dBioMed CentralwJournal:2211x1743-70757nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12986-017-0226-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02292naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001700145245009400162520131400256592002801570650002401598650001201622650001201634650001501646650001301661650001301674650001701687650001001704700002001714700002201734773012201756856007901878852000901957655001201966IND60676985620221117223318.0191122e20191113xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067698562DNAL7 a10.3390/agronomy91107512doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBlank, Lior 10aSpatial and Temporal Distribution of <i>Ecballium</i> <i>elaterium</i> in Almond Orchards  aThe concept of site-specific weed management is based on the assumption that weeds are aggregated in patches. In this study, we surveyed four plots in four commercial almond orchards for three years and mapped the locations of Ecballium elaterium, a troublesome weed in Israeli agriculture, specifically in almond orchards. We analyzed the spatial pattern of the plants&rsquo; locations using nearest neighbor analysis and Ripley&rsquo;s L function. The number of E. elaterium plants increased by more than 70% in the four plots from 2015 to 2016. In addition, the observed mean distance between nearest neighbors increased by more than 10% from 2016 and 2017. We found in all four plots that the spatial pattern of E. elaterium was clustered and that these weed patch locations were consistent over the years although the density within the patches increased. The extent of these clusters ranged between 40 to 70 m and remained similar in size throughout the study. These features make E. elaterium a suitable target for site-specific weed management and for pre-emergence patch spraying.

As a vital member of TLR family TLR9 can be activated by bacterial DNA and induce the production of inflammatory cytokines. In this study, a full length of TLR9 homologue of 3677 bp in Nibea albiflora (named as NaTLR9, GenBank accession no: MN125017.1) was characterized, and its ORF was 3180 bp encoding 1059 amino acid residues with a calculated molecular weight of 121.334 kDa (pI = 6.29). Several leucine-rich repeated sequences (LRR domain) and conservative TIR domain were found in NaTLR9, which was mainly expressed in dendritic cells and macrophages. The phylogenetic and synteny analysis further revealed high sequence identity of NaTLR9 with its counterparts of other teleost, confirming their correct nomenclature and conservative during evolution as an important pattern recognition receptor. The NaTLR9-TIR-pEGFP-N1 fusion protein showed green fluorescence and mainly distributed in the cytoplasm. After co-transfection of NaTLR9-TIR-pEGFP-N1 and NaMyD88-pDsRED-Monomer-N1, green fluorescence obviously overlapped with red and changed into yellowish-green, which suggested that there might be the interaction between homologous NaTLR9-TIR and MyD88. Based on this result the pCDNA3.1-NaTLR9-TIR-flag and pcMV-NaMyD88-TIR-Myc plasmids were co-transfected into 293T cells for the immunoprecipitation test. According to Western blot, TLR9 and MyD88 protein could interact with each other. Furthermore, NaTLR9 was ubiquitously expressed in all the investigated tissues, most abundantly in head kidney, followed by stomach, spleen, liver and gill, but lower in muscle. The vitro immune stimulation experiments revealed that Pseudomonas plecoglossicida and polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid [Poly (I:C)] induced higher levels of NaTLR9 mRNA expression with the peaks of 9.52 times at 2 h and 39.91 times at 24 h compared with the control group respectively. The functional domains (LRRs and TIR, named NaTLR9-TIR and NaTLR9-LRR respectively) of NaTLR9 were expressed and purified, the recombinant proteins both could bind three kinds of typical aquatic pathogenic bacteria (Vibrio. parahaemolyticus, Vibrio alginolyticus, and Vibrio harveyi), which showed that NaTLR9 could couple to bacteria by its function domains. The aforementioned results indicated that NaTLR9 played a significant role in the defense against pathogenic bacteria infection in innate immune response of sciaenidae fish, which may provide some further understandings of the regulatory mechanisms in the teleostean innate immune system.  aPublisher supplied data 3aNibea albiflora 3aPseudomonas plecoglossicida 3aToll-like receptor 9 3aVibrio alginolyticus 3aVibrio harveyi 3aWestern blotting 3aamino acids 3acytokines 3acytoplasm 3afish 3afluorescence 3agene expression 3ainnate immunity 3akidneys 3aliver 3amacrophages 3amolecular weight 3amuscles 3aphylogeny 3aplasmids 3apolyinosinic-polycytidylic acid 3aprecipitin tests 3asequence analysis 3ashellfish 3aspleen 3astomach 0aToll-like receptor 9 (TLR9) 0aPoly(I:C)1 aYang, Meijun1 aTang, Xiuqin1 aLiu, Jiaxin1 aZheng, Libing1 aXu, Dongdong1 aChi, Changfeng1 aLv, Zhenming0 tFish & shellfish immunology.g2021 Nov., v. 118 p.321-332dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl4175048x1050-46487nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fsi.2021.09.0213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03188naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100002200166245012000188300001800308520167100326592002801997650001002025650001602035650001502051650001902066650000902085650001202094650001602106650001002122650002202132650001002154650001402164650001402178650001402192650000902206650002002215650001202235650002002247650001602267650001102283650002102294650001102315650002202326650002302348650002502371700002102396700002102417700001802438700002202456773008702478856004802565852000902613655001202622IND50068056720221120165536.0130724e201308  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006805672DNAL7 a232924532pmid7 a10.1007/s00442-012-2570-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZanette, Liana Y.10aFood use is affected by the experience of nest predation: implications for indirect predator effects on clutch size  ap. 1031-1039.  aIndirect predator effects on prey demography include any effect not attributable to direct killing and can be mediated by perceived predation risk. Though perceived predation risk clearly affects foraging, few studies have yet demonstrated that it can chronically alter food intake to an extent that affects demography. Recent studies have used stable isotopes to gauge such chronic effects. We previously reported an indirect predator effect on the size of subsequent clutches laid by song sparrows (Melospiza melodia). Females that experienced frequent experimental nest predation laid smaller clutches and were in poorer physiological condition compared to females not subject to nest predation. Every female was provided with unlimited supplemental food that had a distinctive ¹³C signature. Here, we report that frequent nest predation females had lower blood δ¹³C values, suggesting that the experience of nest predation caused them to eat less supplemental food. Females that ate less food gained less fat and were in poorer physiological condition, consistent with the effect on food use contributing to the indirect predator effect on clutch size. Tissue δ¹⁵N values corroborated that clutch size was not likely constrained by endogenous resources. Finally, we report that the process of egg production evidently affects egg δ¹³C values, and this may mask the source of nutrients to eggs. Our results indicate that perceived predation risk may impose food limitation on prey even where food is unlimited and such predator-induced food limitation ought to be added to direct killing when considering the total effect of predators on prey numbers.  aPublisher supplied data 3ablood 3aclutch size 3ademography 3aegg production 3aeggs 3afemales 3afood intake 3afoods 3along term effects 3anests 3anutrients 3apredation 3apredators 3arisk 3astable isotopes 2aAnimals 2aCarbon Isotopes 2aClutch Size 2aEating 2aFeeding Behavior 2aFemale 2aNitrogen Isotopes 2aPredatory Behavior 2aSparrowsxphysiology1 aHobson, Keith A.1 aClinchy, Michael1 aTravers, Marc1 aWilliams, Tony D.0 tOecologia.g2013 Aug., v. 172, no. 4 p.1031-1039dSpringer-Verlagx0029-85497nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00442-012-2570-y  aDNAL 7aarticle02781naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245011800168300001800286520154000304592002801844650002101872650002701893650003101920650001501951650001901966650001901985650001902004650001902023650001202042650001502054650001802069650001302087650001402100700002002114700001902134700002002153700002302173773010602196856004802302852000902350655001202359IND50059354220221120222321.0130325e201210  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5005935422DNAL7 a10.1007/s11947-011-0749-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFröhling, Antje12aA Method for Viability Testing of Pectobacterium carotovorum in Postharvest Processing by Means of Flow Cytometry  ap. 2871-2879.  aRapid detection methods such as flow cytometric analysis enable the detection of phytopathogenic and human pathogenic bacteria and hence, the monitoring and optimisation of inactivation processes. The aim of this study was to develop a method for viability testing of the soft-rot-causing Gram-negative bacteria Pectobacterium carotovorum spp. carotovorum by flow cytometry based on a combination of carboxyfluorescein diacetate (cFDA) and propidium iodide. Due to the cell membrane composition of Gram-negative bacteria, the uptake ability of cFDA indicating esterase activity is limited. In this study, an adequate dye concentration (0.83 mM cFDA) and incubation time (45 min) at 37 °C for bacteria suspensions with a theoretical optical density (OD₆₂₀) above 5 were defined, which enables a reliable determination of esterase activity of Gram-negative bacteria. This developed staining procedure was successfully applied to monitor inactivation treatments. It was shown that the test bacteria (Escherichia coli and P. carotovorum) lose their culturability due to the applied thermal treatment, but physiological activities were still detectable using flow cytometry. The remaining physiological activities may still result in product spoilage and may also cause human diseases. For example, E. coli cells still showed esterase activity after 10 min of thermal treatment at 70 °C. The degree of bacterial damage due to the inactivation processes is highly dependent on treatment parameters as well as on treated bacteria.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3aGram-negative bacteria 3aPectobacterium carotovorum 3aabsorbance 3acell membranes 3aflow cytometry 3aheat treatment 3ahuman diseases 3aiodides 3amonitoring 3arapid methods 3aspoilage 3aviability1 aKlocke, Susanne1 aHausdorf, Lena1 aKlocke, Michael1 aSchlüter, Oliver,0 tFood and bioprocess technology.g2012 Oct., v. 5, no. 7 p.2871-2879dSpringer-Verlagx1935-51307nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11947-011-0749-6  aDNAL 7aarticle01845naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002400149245007800173300001800251520079000269592002801059650001201087650002501099650002601124650001101150650001401161650002801175650002701203650002501230700001701255700001701272773009101289856008301380990002301463852000901486655001201495IND60096688620221120214731.0141104e201207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009668862DNAL7 a10.1016/j.eneco.2011.09.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBertinelli, Luisito10aSustainable economic development and the environment: Theory and evidence  ap. 1105-1114.  aThe relationship between growth and pollution is studied through a vintage capital model, where new technologies are more environmentally friendly.

The outcome will depend on countries’ investment path and their propensity to innovate in environmentally clean technologies, both of which are likely to differ across economies.

Herein, a simple but effective method is reported to fabricate a novel PCN-CuS-FA-ICG-based nanoplatform for dual-modal imaging-guided synergistic photothermal/photodynamic therapy. Porphyrinic metal–organic frameworks with CuS NPs are obtained in aqueous solution via a simple post-synthesis strategy. Furthermore, to obtain a more effective therapy, indocyanine green (ICG) was incorporated into the multifunctional theranostic platform to promote the photothermal therapeutic effect. The as-prepared PCN-CuS-FA-ICG not only exhibits an excellent ¹O₂ generation efficiency under 650 nm irradiation to achieve remarkable photodynamic cell killing, but also presents outstanding photothermal conversion under 808 nm irradiation to destroy tumor tissues by hyperthermia. In particular, the nanotherapeutic agent realized fluorescence and thermal imaging dual-modal imaging-guided cancer treatment. Meanwhile, in vivo experiments confirmed the evident accumulation of nanoparticles (NPs) at local tumors, and tumor growth was inhibited obviously via synergistic photothermal/photodynamic therapy with negligible side effects.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadverse effects 3aantineoplastic agents 3aaqueous solutions 3acoordination polymers 3afever 3afluorescence 3aimage analysis 3ain vivo studies 3airradiation 3ananoparticles 3aneoplasms 3aphotochemotherapy 3asinglet oxygen 3athermography 3atissues 3atoxicity1 aLu, Yonglin1 aZhou, Lulu1 aChen, Lv1 aYao, Tianming1 aLiang, Shujing1 aHan, Junyi1 aDong, Chunyan1 aShi, Shuo0 tJournal of materials chemistry B.g2020 Feb. 5, v. 8, no. 5 p.935-944dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26902x2050-75187nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c9tb02597a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03741naa a2200601 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024004200133040001800175100001700193245008200210300001800292506007600310520194300386592002802329506003702357650002402394650002402418650002102442650001702463650001902480650002402499650001702523650001502540650001002555650001302565650002302578650001502601650001102616650002302627650001902650650001002669650001202679650002802691650001702719650002302736650003702759650002902796650002402825650001702849650000902866651001102875700002402886700002202910700002002932773011102952856005503063852000903118655001203127IND4473423020221207124647.0120727e201111  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447342302DNAL7 a215690312pmid7 aPMC32533382pmcid7 a10.1111/j.1365-2656.2011.01860.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWeslien, Jan10aLong‐term priority effects among insects and fungi colonizing decaying wood  ap. 1155-1162.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  a1. Priority effects have been hypothesized to have long‐lasting impact on community structure in natural ecosystems. Long‐term studies of priority effects in natural ecosystems are however sparse, especially in terrestrial ecosystems. 2. Wood decay is a slow process involving a high diversity of insect and fungus species. Species interactions that drive change in communities of insects and fungi during wood decay are poorly understood because of a lack of sufficient long‐term studies. 3. In this paper, we followed the colonization and succession of wood‐living insects and fungi on cut trees during 15 years, from tree death and onwards, in a boreal forest landscape. We test the long‐term priority effects hypothesis that the identity and abundance of species that colonize first affect the colonization success of later‐arriving species. We also hypothesize that species interact in both facilitative and inhibitory ways, which ultimately affect habitat quality for a red‐listed late‐succession beetle species. 4. Possible causal associations between species were explored by path analysis. The results indicate that one bark beetle species, Hylurgops palliatus, and one wood‐borer species, Monochamus sutor, which colonized the wood during the first year after cutting, influenced the occurrence of a rare, wood‐living beetle, Peltis grossa, that started to emerge from the stumps about 10 years later. The positive effects of Hylurgops palliatus and negative effects of M. sutor were largely mediated through the wood‐decaying fungus species Fomitopsis pinicola. 5. The study shows that variable priority effects may have long‐lasting impact on community assembly in decaying wood. The study also exemplifies new possibilities for managing populations of threatened species by exploring links between early, well‐understood species guilds and late, more poorly understood species guilds.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aFomitopsis pinicola 3aHylurgops palliatus 3aMonochamus sutor 3abark beetles 3aboreal forests 3acommunity structure 3adecayed wood 3aecosystems 3afungi 3ahabitats 3ainsect communities 3alandscapes 3astumps 3athreatened species 3atree mortality 3atrees 2aAnimals 2aColeopteraxphysiology. 2aBiodiversity 2aModels, Biological 2aPiceaxmicrobiologyxphysiology. 2aPolyporaceaexphysiology 2aSpecies Specificity 2aTime Factors 2aWood 0aSweden1 aDjupström, Line B.1 aSchroeder, Martin1 aWidenfalk, Olof0 tjournal of animal ecology.g2011 Nov., v. 80, no. 6 p.1155-1162dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0021-87907nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2656.2011.01860.x  aDNAL 7aarticle02983naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001600148245010400164300001400268520140000282592002801682650001701710650001201727650002501739650002201764650001401786650001901800650003501819650002201854650002301876650002501899650003101924650000901955650002001964650001601984650001202000650001402012651001002026653001502036653001902051653001202070653001502082653001202097700001902109700001602128700001802144700001402162700002702176773014602203856008302349852000902432655001202441IND60697998820221121061210.0210519e202101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069799882DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fshw.2020.05.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHe, Yinyuan10aPhysico-chemical properties and structure of rice cultivars grown in Heilongjiang Province of China  ap. 45-53.  aThe relationships between chemical composition, structure and physicochemical properties such as pasting, thermal, and textural properties of 12 temperate rice cultivars grown in Heilongjiang Province, China were investigated in this study. There were significant differences in the content of fat, protein, ash, amylose, damaged starch among 12 cultivars. Brabender Viscograph results showed that gelatinization time, peak viscosity, pasting and peak temperature ranged from 9 min to 15 min, 2100 BU to 2500 BU, 58.75 ℃ to 72.00 ℃ and 63.75 ℃ to 84.45 ℃, respectively, except for the waxy one Longjing 9. Tₒ, Tₚ, Tc and ΔH were found in the range of 58.34 ℃ to 67.96 ℃, 65.39 ℃ to 75.38 ℃, 78.47 ℃ to 90.69 ℃ and 2.036 J/g to 3.127 J/g respectively. Scanning Electron Micro-photograph results showed that all starch granules were polyhedral with irregular shapes, except Longjing 9 showing signs of the loss of physical integrity. The hardness, adhesiveness, springiness, gumminess, cohesiveness and resilience ranged from 395.87 g to 1161.76 g, -90.842 g·mm to -36.4 g·mm, 0.498 to 0.747, 78.631 g to 466.837 g, 0.199 to 0.569, 0.321 to 0.504, respectively.

The prepared membrane with CNT inner diameter of 3.9 nm exhibits no water permeation below the critical temperature of 26 °C, after which water permeability is first observed and increases with temperatures >26 °C. Further, the critical temperature decreases to 18 °C when the CNT inner diameter increases to 6.0 nm. The water permeation in the CNT-confined space exhibits activation energy transitions around room temperature, thereby suggesting that the confined water molecules in CNTs exhibit plural ordered structures.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactivation energy 3aambient temperature 3acarbon 3acarbon nanotubes 3apermeability1 aZhang, Shaoling1 aAiba, Motohiro1 aInoue, Hirotaka1 aHada, Masaki1 aHayashi, Yasuhiko1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4113-55481 aHata, Kenjiro1 aTsuruoka, Shuji1 aMatsumoto, Hidetoshi1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4949-11840 tCarbon.g2019 May, v. 146 p.785-788dElsevier LtdwJournal:11670x0008-62237nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbon.2019.02.0313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02445naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002700145245019900172520105400371592002801425650001501453650002501468650002501493650002201518650002501540650001901565650002201584650002301606650001301629650001601642650001401658650001401672650001401686700002301700700002601723700002201749700002301771700001901794773012201813856007901935852000902014655001202023IND60676985920221117223316.0191122e20191114xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067698592DNAL7 a10.3390/agronomy91107542doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aViriyasuthee, Wanalai 10aEffective Plant Ages for Screening for Field Resistance to Alternaria Leaf Spot (Caused by <i>Alternaria</i> spp.) under Natural Infection in Jerusalem artichoke (<i>Helianthus tuberosus</i> L.)  aHost plant resistance has proven to be effective for controlling Alternaria leaf spot on Jerusalem artichoke (JA), but efficient screening techniques have not been developed yet. The objective of this study is to estimate the relationship between disease resistance parameters of JA as a function of plant age. Six JA varieties and three plant ages at the time of inoculation (20, 40 and 60 days after transplanting) (DAT) are evaluated in a factorial experiment in randomized complete block design (RCBD) with four replications. Disease incidence (DI) and severity (DS) are estimated, from which area under the disease progress curve (AUDPC) was calculated. Disease parameters are positively and significantly correlated for plant ages of 40 and 60 DAT. Based on our results, screening of JA at 40 DAT for resistance to Alternaria leaf spot is recommended. Knowledge of the impact of plant age on resistance to key diseases can help breeders to accelerate breeding programs so superior genotypes can be identified before reproductive growth stages.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAlternaria 3aHelianthus tuberosus 3aJerusalem artichokes 3abreeding programs 3adevelopmental stages 3adisease course 3adisease incidence 3adisease resistance 3agenotype 3ahost plants 3aleaf spot 3aplant age 3ascreening1 aSaepaisan, Suwita 1 aSaksirirat, Weerasak 1 aGleason, Mark  L.1 aChen, Ruey  Shyang1 aJogloy, Sanun 0 tAgronomy.g2019 Nov. 14, v. 9, no. 11dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:12361x2073-43957nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agronomy91107543Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02476naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100003500149245005000184300001800234520144100252592002801693650002301721650001601744650001101760650001401771650001801785650001701803650001201820650001801832650001101850650002901861700001801890773009101908856008301999990002302082852000902105655001202114IND60096688920221120082334.0141104e201207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009668892DNAL7 a10.1016/j.eneco.2011.10.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKopsakangas-Savolainen, Maria,10aReal-Time Pricing in the Nordic Power markets  ap. 1131-1142.  aIn this paper we study the potential effects of Real-Time Pricing (RTP) of electricity on the need for long-run capacities in the Nordic Power markets. A characteristic of the Nordic Power market is the large variety of production technologies, of which hydro and nuclear power are capacity constrained. We analyze the impact of RTP on: the need for total, peak and midmerit capacities; total demand; prices; peak demand hours; and economic welfare. We have also studied whether the results of RTP are sensitive to the simultaneous implementation of tradable emission permits. We find that RTP diminishes the need for total capacity even with inelastic demand. Our results show that even with modest assumptions related to RTP participation, the annual midmerit and peaker capacity efficiency savings amount to 97million Euros, which are around 6% of their total annual investment costs. The price of the peak demand hour clearly diminishes as the share of the RTP customers increases or demand becomes more price elastic. We compare RTP and tradable emission permits as two separate instruments in reaching energy use efficiencies and show how these two instruments must be seen as complementary and not as substitutable instruments. We show how RTP and tradable emission permits have a positive correlation in promoting market access of renewable energy sources. We find that welfare effects of the implementation of RTP are positive.  aPublisher supplied data 3aconsumers (people) 3aelectricity 3aenergy 3aequipment 3amarket access 3amarket power 3amarkets 3anuclear power 3aprices 3arenewable energy sources1 aSvento, Rauli0 tEnergy economics.g2012 July, v. 34, no. 4 p.1131-1142dElsevier B.V.x0140-98837nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.eneco.2011.10.0063Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02565naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002600150245006800176300001600244520127200260592002801532650001301560650001301573650000901586650001901595650001301614650001101627650001601638700007001654700002601724700002201750700002401772700001901796700002301815700002001838700006001858700005701918773008601975856008502061852000902146655001202155IND60633257520221122090042.0190502e201905  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063325752DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbon.2019.02.0412doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSampathkumar, Krishna10aSculpturing graphene wrinkle patterns into compliant substrates  ap. 772-778.  aIn this work we present a fabrication process for sculpturing wrinkled structures into soft polymers by thermal treatment of graphene flakes. This is accomplished by the imposition of a biaxial compressive stress field to the graphene flakes by controlled heating of graphene/polymer composites. The wrinkling patterns (amplitude, wavelength) are linearly related to the thickness of the graphene as in the case of a stiff film deposited on a compliant substrate. The orientation of the wrinkles is controlled by the geometry of the flakes, such as that long and narrow flakes exhibit perfectly parallel wrinkles perpendicular to the longer edge, while more equilateral specimens are wrinkled without any preferred orientation in the flake interior. Kelvin probe measurements showed that this type of wrinkling does not affect the surface potential of the graphene flakes. The universality of the technique is validated by sculpturing two different polymers, using mechanically exfoliated flakes as well as large graphene prepared by chemical vapor deposition. We thus demonstrate that the present approach is an excellent method for patterning the surface of soft matter in a number of applications with nanoscale features of lateral dimensions as low as ∼50 nm.  aPublisher supplied data 3ageometry 3agraphene 3aheat 3aheat treatment 3apolymers 3avapors 3awavelengths1 aAndroulidakis, Charalampos1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5264-18411 aKoukaras, Emmanuel N.1 aRahova, Jaroslava1 aDrogowska, Karolina1 aKalbac, Martin1 aVetushka, Aliaksei1 aFejfar, Antonin1 aGaliotis, Costas1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8079-54881 aFrank, Otakar1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9661-62500 tCarbon.g2019 May, v. 146 p.772-778dElsevier LtdwJournal:11670x0008-62237nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbon.2019.02.0413Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01721naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002000149245016100169300001800330520051000348592002800858650001600886650001500902650003600917650002100953650002300974650002300997650001301020650001401033700001401047700001501061700001401076700001301090700001201103700002001115773010601135856008501241852000901326655001201335IND60578878420221120230931.0170814e20150605xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057887842DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.orglett.5b011852doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiang, Hong-Wen10aRedox-Neutral Palladium-Catalyzed C–H Functionalization To Form Isoindolinones with Carboxylic Acids or Anhydrides as Readily Available Starting Materials  ap. 2764-2767.  aAn operationally simple, Pd-catalyzed C–H functionalization is described for the synthesis of important and useful isoindolinones from readily available carboxamides and carboxylic acids or anhydrides.

Market structure refers in particular to the number of firms active in the market and the intensity of oligopolistic competition as measured by the conjectural variation, as well as to the functional form of the power demand and supply curves. In addition, we analyse briefly the impact of other power market-related factors on the PTR of carbon costs to electricity prices. These include in particular the impact of ET-induced changes in the merit order of power generation technologies and the impact of pursuing other market strategies besides maximising generator profit, such as maximising market shares or sales revenues of power companies. Each of these factors can have a significant impact on the rate of passing-through carbon costs to electricity prices.  aPublisher supplied data 3abusiness enterprises 3acarbon 3acarbon dioxide 3aelectricity 3aelectricity costs 3aenvironmental markets 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3aincome 3amarket power 3apower generation 3aprices 3asales 3asupply balance1 aChen, Yihsu1 aHobbs, B.

In this study, invasive Oxalis corymbosa and Peperomia pellucida were compared with their respective noninvasive alien congeners. We hypothesized that the invasive species have higher specific leaf (SLA) than their respective noninvasive alien congeners, and analyzed the physiological and ecological consequences of the higher SLA. Higher SLA was indeed the most important trait for the two invaders, which was associated with their lower leaf construction cost, higher nitrogen (N) allocation to photosynthesis and photosynthetic N use efficiency (PNUE). The higher N allocation to photosynthesis of the invaders in turn increased their PNUE, N content in photosynthesis, biochemical capacity for photosynthesis, and therefore light-saturated photosynthetic rate. The above resource capture-, use- and growth-related traits may facilitate the two invaders’ invasion, while further comparative studies on a wider range of invasive and noninvasive congeners are needed to understand the generality of this pattern and to fully assess the competitive advantages afforded by these traits.  aPublisher supplied data 3aindigenous species 3ainvasive species 3aleaf area 3aleaves 3anitrogen 3anitrogen content 3aphotosynthesis 2aMagnoliopsidaxphysiologyxradiation effects. 2aEnergy Metabolismxradiation effects 2aLight 2aNitrogenxmetabolism 2aPeperomiaxphysiologyxradiation effects. 2aPhotosynthesisxphysiologyxradiation effects. 2aPlant Leavesxphysiologyxradiation effects.1 aFu, Gai-Lan1 aZheng, Yu-Long0 tPlanta.g2008 Aug., v. 228, no. 3 p.383-390dSpringer-Verlagx0032-09357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00425-008-0732-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02763naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002200151245012300173300001600296520136800312592002801680650002301708650002501731650002301756650002301779650001201802650002501814650001101839650002101850650001401871650001701885650001501902650001501917653004401932653003301976653001002009653001302019700002102032700001802053700002102071773013002092856008602222852000902308655001202317IND60769084320221119052300.0220303e20220304xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076908432DNAL7 a10.1080/09583157.2021.20078512doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHetjens, Bernd T.14aThe application of Raman spectroscopy in identifying Metarhizium brunneum, Metarhizium pemphigi and Beauveria bassiana  ap. 329-340.  aPrevious research on the identification of fungi by means of their Raman spectra (i.e. spectra based on the inelastic scattering of light) of their spores indicates that this approach could be a fast, cheap and reliable method to distinguish fungi. Entomopathogenic fungi are used in commercially available insecticides (mycoinsecticides), in particular species of the genera Beauveria and Metarhizium. The identification of fungi in infected organisms is necessary for efficacy studies as well as in environmental impact assessments. This study aims at developing a method to differentiate isolates of these fungi, more precisely isolates of Metarhizium brunneum (Ca8II, Cb15III, Cb16III), Metarhizium pemphigi (X1c) and Beauveria bassiana (DSM 62075) as a non-related reference. To this end, fungi were grown on different culture media (both artificial and natural); samples were taken at different ages of the culture to assess possible impacts of nutrition and age on conidial pigmentation. It was possible to obtain spectra from the conidia of these fungi. The final predictive model was capable of determining isolated conidia grown on model insects with an overall goodness of prediction of 98.8% without any further sample preparation. In conclusion, Raman microspectroscopy proves to be a reliable and fast approach to distinguish entomopathogenic fungi.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBeauveria bassiana 3aMetarhizium brunneum 3aRaman spectroscopy 3abiological control 3aconidia 3aenvironmental impact 3amodels 3amycoinsecticides 3anutrition 3apigmentation 3aprediction 3atechnology 0aEndophytic entomopathogenic fungi (EEF) 0aentomopathogenic fungi (EPF) 0aRaman 0apigments1 aTewes, Thomas J.1 aPlatte, Frank1 aWichern, Florian0 tBiocontrol science and technology.g2022 Mar. 04, v. 32, no. 3 p.329-340dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl55514x1360-04787nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09583157.2021.20078513Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02258naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100002200188245011000210300001600320506007600336520101200412592002801424506003701452650002501489650001801514650001401532650001501546650001401561650000901575650001601584650002201600650002401622700001801646700001901664773012001683856004801803852000901851655001201860IND50064200520221207141903.0130327e201304  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006420052DNAL7 a10.1007/s11746-012-2194-82doi7 aPMC36065182pmcid7 a235390892pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSzterk, Arkadiusz10aChemical Stability of the Lipid Phase in Concentrated Beverage Emulsions Colored with Natural β-Carotene  ap. 483-491.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe aim of this study was to examine the oxidation of selected plant oils in concentrated beverage emulsions colored with natural β-carotene. Carotenoid preparations obtained from carrots were dissolved in cold-pressed linseed oil, refined canola oil, and refined palm olein. Oxidative stability of the lipids was examined with and without addition of the pigment to the oil/water (O/W) emulsion. Carotenoid/lipid hydro peroxide (LOOH) concentration was evaluated using two different methods: LOOH + Fe²⁺ reaction connected with a colored complex of ammonium thiocyanate determined with the help of a spectrophotometer, and LOOH determined with the help of a chemiluminometer. It was shown that oxidation rate of lipids in the O/W emulsions strongly depended on chemical composition of the lipid fraction (type of oil used). Presence of the carotenoid pigment increased the rate. Therefore, if a carotenoid-containing emulsion is to be stable, it should be based on oils of a high oxidative stability.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aammonium thiocyanate 3abeta-carotene 3abeverages 3acanola oil 3aemulsions 3airon 3alinseed oil 3alipid composition 3aoxidative stability1 aRoszko, Marek1 aGórnicka, Ewa0 tjournal of the American Oil Chemists' Society.g2013 Apr., v. 90, no. 4 p.483-491dSpringer-Verlagx0003-021X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11746-012-2194-8  aDNAL 7aarticle02442naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002500148245014200173300001800315520107200333592002801405650001801433650001401451650002501465653002201490653001701512653002701529653001301556653001101569653002201580653001301602700002901615700006201644700006501706700006501771773012801836856008301964852000902047655001202056IND60755904420221120071716.0211219s2021    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075590442DNAL7 a10.1016/j.csbj.2021.10.0362doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLobanov, Mikhail Yu.10aIs there an advantageous arrangement of aromatic residues in proteins?

The clustering of protein structures from the Protein Data Bank (PDB) was performed. Conformations of interacting aromatic residues were analyzed for 511282 pairs in 35493 protein structures sharing less than 50% identity. Pairs with a parallel arrangement of aromatic residues made up 6.2% of all possible ones, which was twice as much as expected. Pairs with a perpendicular arrangement of aromatic residues made up 25%. We demonstrate that the most favorable arrangement was at an angle of 60° between the interacting aromatic residues. Among all possible aromatic pairs, the His-His pair was twice as frequent as expected, and the His-Phe pair was less frequent than expected.

Proteins in milk samples were precipitated by acetonitrile and analytes were derivatised with 3-iodobenzylbromide. Afterwards, derivatives were separated from the matrix by liquid–liquid extraction with ethyl acetate as an organic solvent and analysis was carried out using LC-MS/MS in a positive electrospray mode. The method provides, for all determined analytes, decision limits CCα below 1 ng ml⁻¹ and a detection capability CCβ value below 1.5 ng ml⁻¹. The stability of analytes in sample extracts stored at various conditions was also tested and evaluated.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetonitrile 3aethyl acetate 3agoat milk 3amethylthiouracil 3amilk 3amilk proteins 3apropylthiouracil 3athiouracil 2aAnimals 2aAntithyroid Agentsxanalysis 2aChromatography, Liquidxmethods 2aMilkxchemistry 2aTandem Mass Spectrometryxmethods 0aveterinary drug residues 0amilk 0athyreostats 0achromatography LC/MS 0amethod validation1 aŠťastný, Kamil0 tFood additives & contaminants.g2013 June 1, v. 30, no. 6 p.983-986dTaylor & Francisx1944-00577nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/19440049.2013.787651  aDNAL 7aarticle01509naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002000149245004500169300001800214520067400232592002800906650001300934650002600947650000900973650001100982700002000993773009101013856008301104990002301187852000901210655001201219IND60096689520221121001613.0141104e201207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009668952DNAL7 a10.1016/j.eneco.2011.10.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aScholtens, Bert10aOil price shocks and European industries  ap. 1187-1195.  aWe investigate the impact of oil price shocks at the industry level in the Euro area for the period 1983–2007.

Juvenile density-dependent bottlenecks may become even more pronounced if several cohorts compete, but this has received relatively limited attention in previous literature. We performed a manipulation experiment in seven coastal streams to investigate the presence of inter-cohort competition, using habitat selection, body-size and density of newly emerged (age-0) brown trout (Salmo trutta) as response variables. The trout population (age ≥1 fish) was estimated using electro-fishing prior to the emergence of fry (April–May) and was either removed (manipulated sections) or maintained (control sections). Age-0 habitat selection was examined in June while density and body-size was evaluated in October (end of the growth season). We found that age-0 trout selected habitats that were located further from riffles (nursery habitats) in the absence of age ≥1 trout, suggesting a niche overlap between cohorts in the habitat dimension and, hence, that both inter-cohort competitive interactions and ontogenetic preference may influence habitat utilisation in the wild. Furthermore, we also found age-0 body-size to be significantly larger in manipulated sections and negatively related to its own density. We argue that competition from older cohorts influence the availability of age-0 feeding territories at the critical phase of emergence with secondary negative effects on age-0 growth. These results not only have implications for understanding the mechanisms of density dependence but can also provide valuable knowledge to the management of salmonid populations and their habitats in the wild.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSalmo trutta 3abody size 3afecundity 3afield experimentation 3aniches 3astreams 3atrout 2aAge Factors 2aAnimals 2aBehavior, Animal 2aCompetitive Behavior 2aEcosystem 2aMale 2aPopulation Density 2aTroutxgrowth & development 0aSweden1 aHöjesjö, Johan1 aBohlin, Torgny0 tOecologia.g2012 July, v. 169, no. 3 p.733-742dSpringer-Verlagx0029-85497nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00442-012-2248-5  aDNAL 7aarticle01908naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002100151245008700172300001400259520071200273592002800985650002501013650001601038650001101054650001801065650001801083650002401101651001301125653004101138653003301179653002301212700001701235700002301252700002201275700002201297773010801319856008601427852000901513655001201522IND60769084620221119052258.0220603e20220102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076908462DNAL7 a10.1080/09614524.2020.18664972doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAndaregie, Adino10aDeterminants of micro and small enterprises’ (MSEs) growth in northwest Ethiopia  ap. 39-51.  aThis article reports on a study that aimed to identify potential business constraints that hinder the economic development of micro and small enterprises (MSEs) in Ethiopia.

In this work, a solvent-free mechanochemical polymerization is used to derive mesoporous carbons with narrow pore size distributions and specific surface areas of up to 1660 m² g⁻¹. The size of the mesopores can be tailored by simply adjusting milling parameters like the milling speed. Finally, the carbons have been applied as supercapacitors through a new approach - the ‘in situ electrolyte’ concept. This holistic concept does not treat the accumulating by-products of the carbon synthesis as waste, but rather utilizes them directly as electrolyte salts. With this, washing steps are circumvented and the use of any solvent becomes obsolete.  aPublisher supplied data 3abyproducts 3acarbon 3aelectrolytes 3amechanochemistry 3amilling 3apolymerization 3aporosity 3aporous media 3asalts 3asolvents 3awashing 3awastes1 aWegner, Karl1 aEßbach, Claudia1 aSander, Miriam1 aSchneidermann, Christina1 aBorchardt, Lars1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8778-78160 tCarbon.g2019 June, v. 147 p.43-50dElsevier LtdwJournal:11670x0008-62237nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbon.2019.02.0653Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02825naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002000140245015400160500002000314520126200334592002801596596004401624650002001668650001801688650002501706650001001731650001801741650001601759650000901775650001101784650001301795650001701808650001401825650002001839650001601859650001701875650001001892650002501902650001301927700002101940700002101961700005901982700002002041700005902061773012802120856007402248852000902322655001202331IND60674681220221120080641.0191029e201911  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067468122DNAL7 a10.1111/jfbc.130042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHarwanto, Dicky14aThe hot water extract and active components nicotinamide and guanosine of the leather carp Cyprinus carpio nudis improve exercise performance in mice  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aWe identified the main active, exercise performance‐enhancing compounds in a hot water extract of the leather carp, Cyprinus carpio nudus, as nicotinamide and guanosine. Mice were fed casein (30 mg/ml) enriched with nicotinamide (0.1 mg/ml) and guanosine (0.05 mg/ml) once daily for a week at 10 µl/g body weight. Swimming endurance (57%) and forelimb grip strength (21%) were increased significantly. The diet had little effect on body weight. After the swimming exercise, the blood glucose and superoxide dismutase levels were significantly higher (137% and 131%, respectively) than in the saline controls. The blood lactate level was 90% of that in the controls. The estimated amount of nicotinamide in the carp fillet was 26.2 mg/kg. These results suggest that the triple combination of casein with nicotinamide and guanosine improves exercise performance and delays the onset of fatigue, supporting the traditional use of carp extract in healthcare as a tonic soup. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: The triple‐combination of casein (30 mg/ml) + nicotinamide (0.1 mg/ml) + guanosine (0.05 mg/ml) significantly enhanced the exercise performance and anti‐fatigue in mice, supporting the traditional use of carp extract in healthcare as a tonic soup.  aPublisher supplied data  cMinistry of Oceans and Fisheries, Korea 3aCyprinus carpio 3aanimal models 3aathletic performance 3ablood 3ablood glucose 3abody weight 3acarp 3acasein 3aexercise 3afish fillets 3aguanosine 3ahealth services 3alactic acid 3anicotinamide 3asoups 3asuperoxide dismutase 3aswimming1 aArdiansyah, Ardi1 aJin, Hyung‐Joo1 aChoi, Jae‐Suk1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8151-60541 aJin, Deuk‐Hee1 aHong, Yong‐Ki1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6938-44580 tJournal of food biochemistry.g2019 Nov., v. 43, no. 11 p.e13004-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl8484x0145-88847nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jfbc.130043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02317naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100002100142245009700163300001800260520117200278592002801450650001501478650001401493650001801507650001501525650001301540650001201553650004401565700002101609700002301630700002401653700005801677773014701735856007601882852000901958655001201967IND60603100820221118010935.0180712e20170614xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060310082DNAL7 a10.1021/jacs.7b038122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHong, Cynthia M.10aConformational Selection as the Mechanism of Guest Binding in a Flexible Supramolecular Host  ap. 8013-8021.  aThis study offers a detailed mechanistic investigation of host–guest encapsulation behavior in a new enzyme–mimetic metal–ligand host and provides the first observation of a conformational selection mechanism (as opposed to induced fit) in a supramolecular system. The Ga₄L₄ host described features a C₃-symmetric ligand motif with meta-substituted phenyl spacers, which enables the host to initially self-assemble into an S₄-symmetric structure and then subsequently isomerize to a T-symmetric tetrahedron for better accommodation of a sufficiently large guest. Selective inversion recovery ¹H NMR studies provide structural insights into the self-exchange behaviors of the host and the guest individually in this dynamic system. Kinetic analysis of the encapsulation–isomerization event revealed that increasing the concentration of guest inhibits the rate of host–guest relaxation, a key distinguishing feature of conformational selection. A comprehensive study of this simple enzyme mimic provides insight into analogous behavior in biophysics and enzymology and aims to inform the design of efficient self-assembled microenvironment catalysts.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiophysics 3acatalysts 3aencapsulation 3aenzymology 3akinetics 3aligands 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy1 aKaphan, David M.1 aBergman, Robert G.1 aRaymond, Kenneth N.1 aToste, F.

In the past 50 yr, scores of these migratory species, including some once considered common, have declined dramatically. Nearctic–Neotropical migrants normally spend 6–8 months in tropical habitats, making the identification, availability, and management of Neotropical habitats critical issues for their conservation. Yet, for most species, complete and nuanced information about their use of tropical habitats and the relative effects of breeding vs. wintering conditions on survival, productivity, and population trends is not available, though many studies point to Neotropical overwintering habitats as being a strong driver of population change. Particularly important for long-distance Nearctic–Neotropical migrants is an understanding of how “carry-over effects” arise and influence population trends when conditions on wintering grounds and tropical stopover areas affect subsequent reproductive performance on breeding grounds. For example, why some species show strong carry-over effects from tropical habitats while others do not is not fully understood. In recent years, many studies have offered insights into these issues by taking advantage of new scientific methods and technological innovations. In this review, we explore threats facing North American breeding birds that migrate to the Neotropics, summarize knowledge of habitat selection and use on the wintering grounds, describe how conditions at one point in the annual cycle may manifest in subsequent seasons or life history stages, and discuss conservation concerns such as climate change and the potential for phenological mismatch. LAY SUMMARY More than half of the bird species that breed in North America, representing billions of birds, migrate to the Neotropics. In the past 50 years, scores of these species have declined dramatically. Migratory birds normally spend 6–8 months in tropical habitats, making the conservation of these species an international challenge. Yet, for most species, complete and nuanced information about their use of tropical habitats and the relative effects of breeding vs. wintering conditions on survival, productivity, and population trends is not available. Accelerating climate change is adding to the urgency of our gaining an understanding of the full annual and migratory cycle of these birds. In recent years, many studies have offered insights into these issues by taking advantage of new scientific methods and technological innovations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aNeotropics 3aU.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 3aclimate change 3ahabitat preferences 3ahabitats 3alife history 3amigratory behavior 3aoverwintering 3aphenology 3apopulation dynamics 3areproductive performance 3aNorth America 0acarry-over effects 0alandbirds 0amigration 0aNearctic–Neotropical migrants 0aphenological mismatch 0awintering habitat1 aWolfe, Jared D.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5575-086X1 aKellerman, Jherime1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8350-85791 aSherry, Thomas1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5602-26261 aStutchbury, Bridget J.

In this study, we investigated the optical properties of SDAs and evaluated the correlation between optical properties and meteorological factors over the TD area located in the northwest of China. For this, we have utilized the A-train multiple-satellite remote sensing data provided quasi-synchronized observations by the Cloud-aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observations (CALIPSO), CloudSat, and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) instruments for the study period during 2007–2010. Besides, we have verified the meteorological factors observed from the CALIPSO to know the applicability and reliability with the Radiosonde sounding data. We found that the cloud–aerosol discrimination (CAD) algorithm can accurately identify clouds and SDAs over the TD area, especially during blowing dust/floating dust (BD/FD). Overall, it is revealed that the total depolarization ratio of SDAs is below 0.5. Besides, the temperature (T) and pressure (P) of CALIPSO satellite products data are in excellent agreement with the radiosonde sounding measured data over the TD area. Further, most data points during the DS (BD/FD) event spread towards lower (higher) relative humidity (RH) ranged between 0.0386 and 0.6306 (0.1079 and 1.00). Our analysis provides the observational evidence from the CALIOP that the optical properties of vertical dust particles and meteorological elements over the TD have distinct variability below and above 4 km height for DS and BD/FD events. The results obtained will provide not only reliable reference values for the improvement of the CAD algorithm used in the CALIPSO but also provide critical information for model evaluation and enhancement of CALIPSO products.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaerosols 3aalgorithms 3aclimate 3aclimatology 3adust 3aenvironment 3alidar 3amodel validation 3arelative humidity 3asatellites 3aspring 3atemperature 3aChina 0aCALIPSO 0aCloudSat 0aSand-dust aerosol 0aRadiosonde 0aTaklimakan desert1 aHuo, Wen1 aWang, Minzhong1 aZhang, Jiantao1 aMeng, Lu1 aKumar, Kanike Raghavendra1 aDevi, N.S.M.P.

The population of M. incognita was relatively low in the plots receiving seed treatment with Paecilomyces lilacinus, Pochonia chlamydosporia and Pseudomonas fluorescens (10g/kg seed). However, the highest fruit yield was obtained with the application of P. lilacinus (10g/kg + FYM 10t/ha). Results of second season in the same fields during October-January, 2011–2012 confirmed that at higher initial nematode population (465/200cm³soil), adoption of above treatments showed little impact on reduction of nematode population, infection on okra and root galling severity. However, seed treatment with bioformulations (at 10g/kg of seed) proved as the most economical recommendation for root-knot nematode management in okra. This was followed by application of P. lilacinus (10g/kg seed) +FYM at 10t/ha. The study results demonstrated using bioformulations as seed treatment in the highly infested fields of root knot nematode is ineffective for the protection of okra from the infestation of root-knot nematode.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMeloidogyne incognita 3aPochonia chlamydosporia 3aPseudomonas fluorescens 3aPurpureocillium lilacinum 3afruit yield 3anematology 3aokra 3aroot-knot nematodes 3aseed treatment 3aIndia 0aRoot knot nematode 0aPaecilomyces lilacinus1 aKhan, Matiyar Rahaman0 tIndian journal of nematology.g2015 Dec., v. 45, no. 2 p.178-183dThe Nematological Society of IndiawJournal:2020x0974-44447nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle01769naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094024002200124024001900146040001800165100001300183245005300196300001800249506007600267520064000343592002800983506003701011650001501048650001901063650001601082700005401098700005901152773014701211856007601358852000901434655001201443IND60603100920221207114528.0180712e20170628xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060310092DNAL7 a10.1021/jacs.7b038322doi7 aPMC63484722pmcid7 a285485002pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXu, Feng10aPhotochemical Hexadehydro-Diels–Alder Reaction  ap. 8400-8403.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aWe demonstrate that the hexadehydro-Diels–Alder (HDDA) cycloisomerization reaction to produce reactive benzyne derivatives can be initiated photochemically.

This photo-HDDA (or hν-HDDA) reaction occurs at much lower temperatures (including even at −70 °C) than the thermal HDDA, but the benzynes produced behave in the same fashion with respect to their trapping reactions, suggesting they are of the same electronic state.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abyproducts 3aphotochemistry 3atemperature1 aXiao, Xiao1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4671-68351 aHoye, Thomas R.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9318-14770 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2017 June 28, v. 139, no. 25 p.8400-8403dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19166x1520-51267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jacs.7b038323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02879naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004000111040001800151100002600169245019300195300001600388520098700404592002801391650002201419650001701441650002101458650002001479650001501499650001601514650001201530650001201542650002001554650001301574650001701587650001301604650003101617650001201648650002401660650002101684650001701705650005001722650002401772650004101796650006801837651001601905653002001921653002601941653002201967653003201989653003102021700002302052700002302075773010702098856008702205852000902292655001202301IND4465677420221120150918.0190402e20130101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446567742DNAL7 a230174162pmid7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2012.07.1182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTuckey, Nicholas P.L.10aDetermination of volatile compounds in New Zealand Greenshell™ mussels (Perna canaliculus) during chilled storage using solid phase microextraction gas chromatography–mass spectrometry  ap. 218-223.  aGreenshell™ mussels (Perna canaliculus) were dry-stored at 6.44±0.54°C for 8days during which time volatile organic compounds (VOCs) were monitored using SPME GC–MS.

A novel subcutaneous controlled‐release amoxicillin degradable implant for extended‐interval administration in veterinary medicine. J. vet. Pharmacol. Therap.34, 494–498. Dosage forms of antimicrobials play a critical role in facilitating the attainment of pharmacokinetic–pharmacodynamic (PK–PD) targets as well as adherence in both veterinary and human medicine. The purpose of this study was to develop and evaluate a controlled‐release subcutaneous amoxicillin implant for single‐dose therapy of large ruminants such as goats, sheep, and deer. The degradable implant, designed to attain PK–PD targets following single administration, was evaluated for amoxicillin release rate and time–concentration profile. In vitro release studies demonstrated constant‐rate release of approximately 40% of amoxicillin content within 96 h. In an in vivo study in goats, serving as a model for target animals, a serum concentration of approximately 0.4 mg/L was achieved within 8 h of implant insertion and maintained for >6 days. In comparison, in control goats given a standard single intramuscular amoxicillin dose of 15 mg/kg, amoxicillin peaked at 1.2 mg/L after 1 h, rapidly dropping to below detection level at 8 h. These results suggest that the proposed implant offers a unique modality for animal caregivers to conveniently administer a full antimicrobial course following a single dose of an efficient PK–PD‐optimized dosage form.

MXenes with a general formula of Mₙ₊₁XₙTₓ are a class of two-dimensional (2D) transition metal carbides, carbonitrides, and nitrides with unique chemical and physical characteristics as nanomaterials. MXenes feature characteristics such as high conductivity, hydrophobicity, and large specific surface areas that are attracting attention from researchers in many fields including environmental water engineering such as desalination and wastewater treatment as well as designing and building efficient sensors to detect hazardous pollutants in water. In this study, we review recent developments in MXene-based nanocomposites for electrochemical (bio) sensing with a particular focus on the detection of hazardous pollutants, such as organic components, pesticides, nitrite, and heavy metals. Integration of these 2D materials in electrochemical enzyme-based and affinity-based biosensors for environmental pollutants is also discussed. In addition, a summary of the key challenges and future remarks are presented. Although this field is relatively new, future research on biosensors of MXene-based nanocomposites need to exploit the remarkable properties of these 2D materials.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiosensors 3adesalination 3aelectrochemistry 3ahydrophobicity 3ananocomposites 3anitrites 3aremediation 3awastewater treatment 0aMXene 0aElectrochemical sensors 0aEnvironmental pollutants 0aDetection1 aBerkani, Mohammed1 aVasseghian, Yasser1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6225-627X1 aGolzadeh, Nasrin0 tChemosphere.g2022 Mar., v. 291 p.132921-dElsevier LtdwJournal:1969x0045-65357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2021.1329213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03294naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001700140245011800157520174600275592002802021650001902049650001502068650001802083650002002101650002002121650001802141650001502159650001902174650001002193650002402203650001802227650001402245650002802259650002302287650001102310650001902321650001502340650001402355650001402369650001602383650002202399650001502421650002402436650001202460650002202472651001002494700002102504700001802525773012602543856007402669852000902743655001202752IND60652281520221119080418.0190712e20180502xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065228152DNAL7 a10.3390/su100513912doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDing, Haiyan10aDynamics of a Soil Fungal Community in a Three-Year Green Garlic/Cucumber Crop Rotation System in Northwest China  aA decreased soil biological environment in terms of an unstable microbial population and diversity index is primarily caused by intensive continuous cropping systems. In this study, a crop rotation system was established to evaluate the soil fungal diversity using a pyrosequencing-based analysis during three successive growing seasons (2013, 2014, and 2015) under a field pot investigation. We found that overall green garlic/cucumber rotational effects increased cucumber productivity under these growing practices. Analysis of fungal communities in rhizosphere soils by high-throughput pyrosequencing showed that the estimated treatment effects were more obvious during the three-year trials, and OTU richness was much higher than the control in cucumber-planted soils. The relative frequencies of fungal diversity showed variable responses before and after rotation practices, and mainly &alpha;-diversity of fungi increased in garlic planted soil and again decreased after cucumber planted soil in each year. The phylogenetic classification illustrated that the fungal communities were dominated by the taxa Ascomycota, Basidiomycota, Chytridiomycota, Glomeromycota, and Zygomycota across all samples. Particularly, the relative abundance of the taxon Ascomycota was largely and predominantly enriched with the increasing number of garlic bulbs during the three years. Moreover, the majority of abundant taxa positively correlated with available P and K contents, while being highly negatively correlated with soil pH, EC, and SOC. These results indicate that garlic-cucumber-based crop rotations induce fungal richness and diversity and promote the sustainability of agricultural ecosystems, thus enhancing crop growth and production.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAllium sativum 3aAscomycota 3aBasidiomycota 3aChytridiomycota 3aCucumis sativus 3aGlomeromycota 3aZygomycota 3aagroecosystems 3abulbs 3acontinuous cropping 3acrop rotation 3acucumbers 3aelectrical conductivity 3afungal communities 3agarlic 3agrowing season 3aphosphorus 3aphylogeny 3apotassium 3arhizosphere 3asequence analysis 3asoil fungi 3asoil organic carbon 3asoil pH 3aspecies diversity 3aChina1 aʻAlī, Aḥmad,1 aCheng, Zhihui0 tSustainability.g2018 May 02, v. 10, no. 5dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2270x2071-10507nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su100513913Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02521naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100001900112245010200131300001400233506002800247520115900275592002801434506003701462650002201499650001801521650001101539650001601550650001501566650002001581650001201601650001301613650001301626650000701639650001601646650002601662650002001688650001301708650001601721650001801737653001301755653001301768653001901781653001701800653002301817700001801840700002501858773013501883852000902018655001202027IND60785383520221207103006.0160429e201604  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078538352DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBADHE, PALLAVI10aOptimized production of extracellular proteases by Bacillus subtilis from degraded abattoir waste  ap. 29-36.  aResource is Open Access  aProteases are ubiquitous in occurrence and are found in all living organisms. These are essential for cell growth and differentiation. The extracellular proteases are of a high commercial value and find multiple applications in various industrial sectors. The present study describes the screening of protease producing bacteria from a hitherto unexplored source i.e. degraded waste from abattoir. Three isolates were found namely yellow, white and orange coloured bacteria. Amongst them, white colored colony was found to be more suitable for protease production. The morphological, cultural, biochemical and 16S rRNA confirmed that the isolate was Bacillus subtilis. Physical and chemical parameters were optimized for maximum protease production and optimum temperature and pH was found to be 40oC at pH 14. Glucose as a carbon source and yeast extract as a nitrogen source further stimulated the production process giving maximum protease activity to be 20.74 U/ml and 20.67 U/ml. The applications of protease in detergent and solvent industry were tested and it was revealed that the purified enzyme can be used as an additive in detergent industry.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aBacillus subtilis 3abiotechnology 3acarbon 3acell growth 3adetergents 3aenzyme activity 3aglucose 3aindustry 3anitrogen 3apH 3aproteinases 3aslaughterhouse wastes 3aslaughterhouses 3asolvents 3atemperature 3ayeast extract 0aprotease 0atextiles 0aabattoir waste 0aoptimization 0adetergent industry1 aJOSHI, MANASI1 aADIVAREKAR, RAVINDRA0 tJournal of BioScience and Biotechnology.g2016 Apr., v. 5, no. 1 p.29-36dPlovdiv University PresswJournal:27746x1314-62467nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle02560naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100002000112245012900132300001600261500001900277520137200296592002801668650002301696650002701719650002601746650001501772650000901787650001801796650002201814650001501836650001701851650000901868650001301877653002801890653001501918653001501933653001901948700001901967700001901986773013602005852000902141655001202150IND60705802820221118122029.0200807e201512  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070580282DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKaur, Harjinder10aBare-Root-Dip Treatment of Tomato Seedlings with Neem and Bacillus thuringiensis for the Management of Meloidogyne incognita  ap. 202-206.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aA study was conducted to evaluate the nematicidal potential of neem and Bacillus thuringiensis in controlling M. incognita. 5% neem leaf extract (NLE) @ 10ml/seedling, 10% neem seed extract (NSE) @ 10ml/seedling, 1.1X 10⁹ CFU/ml Bt formulations alone @ 10ml/seedling and neem+Bt in combination in the ratio 1: 1 and 2.5% carbofuran 3-G @ 10ml/seedling to control M. incognita infesting tomato plants.

Diurnal activity patterns and feeding behavior of geladas were studied at Kundi, Ankober district, Ethiopia, from August 2017 to March 2018, to cover both wet and dry seasons. The scan sampling method was employed to study the activity patterns and feeding behavior of geladas in the study area. Activity scans were collected at 15-minutes intervals for up to 5-minutes duration from 0700 to 1730h. During each scan, individuals were recorded as performing one of the following behaviors: feeding, moving, resting, playing, aggression, grooming, sexual activity, and others. Descriptive statistics and Chi square test were used in data analysis. During the wet season, geladas spent in grooming 20%, playing 19%, resting 14%, feeding 12%, other activity 11%, moving 9%, and aggression 3%. During the dry season, geladas spent in feeding 27%, moving 21%, other activities 13%, aggression 12%, grooming 7%, playing 7%, and resting 4%. There were significant differences in all activity time budgets between seasons, except for “other activities”. The total time spent feeding on grass blades and cereals in the study area was 25.5% and 23.5%, respectively. There was a significant difference between the age and sex classes of geladas in their activity time budgets. Eleven species of plants were recorded as food for geladas in this study area. This study provides baseline information on the behavioral ecology of geladas outside protected areas.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaggression 3achi-square distribution 3adescriptive statistics 3adiurnal activity 3adry season 3aecology 3agrasses 3awet season 3azoology 3aEthiopia 0aActivity budget 0aAnkober 0aendemic 0ascan sampling 0aTheropithecus gelada 0aoutside protected areas1 aYazezew, Dereje1 aDegefe, Gezahegn0 tTropical zoology.g2021 Dec. 30, v. 34, no. 3 p.79-dPAGEPress PublicationswJournal:2037x0394-69757nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.4081/tz.2021.793Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03185naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001500147245015400162300001600316500001500332520159900347592002801946650001401974650001001988650001901998650002102017650001602038650002002054650002202074650001102096650001302107650002402120650001102144650001302155650001202168650002102180650001802201650001302219650002202232650001402254650001902268650001302287653001702300700001402317700001402331700001602345700001702361700001502378700001602393700001702409773010302426856008102529852000902610655001202619IND60439952520221122053620.0151024e201508  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6043995252DNAL7 a10.1007/s11105-014-0794-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Zhen10aOverexpression of Yeast Arabinono-1,4-Lactone Oxidase Gene (ALO) Increases Tolerance to Oxidative Stress and Al Toxicity in Transgenic Tobacco Plants  ap. 806-818.  a2019-12-06  aL-Ascorbic acid (AsA) is the most abundant antioxidant and a major redox buffer that regulates plant responses to environmental stresses. AsA is also a precursor of oxalate in plants, while oxalate is associated with aluminum (Al) tolerance in some plant species. To enhance AsA in plants and increase tolerance against oxidative stress and Al toxicity, the yeast D-arabinono-1,4-lactone oxidase (ALO) gene was overexpressed in transgenic tobacco plants. Overexpression of ALO promoted synthesis of AsA and oxalate in leaves, but did not affect oxalate level in roots. Compared to the wild type, transgenic plants maintained higher levels of AsA, glutathione, maximal photochemical efficiency (F ᵥ/F ₘ) and the actual PSII efficiency (ΦPSII) of photosystem II (PSII), and non-photochemical quenching (NPQ), and accumulated less H₂O₂ and malondialdehyde (MDA) in leaves in response to methyl viologen- and high-light-induced oxidative stress. In addition, transgenic plants showed higher AsA level and fresh weight of shoot and roots and lower levels of Al, H₂O₂, and MDA in root tips after Al treatment; however, there is no significant difference in organic acid (citrate and oxalate) exudation between the wild-type and transgenic plants in response to Al treatment. The results suggest that AsA and oxalate could be up-regulated by overexpressing ALO. The elevated AsA increased oxidative tolerance due to scavenging of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and induction of NPQ in leaves and enhanced Al tolerance as an antioxidant for avoiding Al-triggered oxidative damages in roots.  aPublisher supplied data 3aroot tips 3agenes 3aplant response 3aoxidative stress 3aglutathione 3amalondialdehyde 3ahydrogen peroxide 3aleaves 3acitrates 3agene overexpression 3ayeasts 3atoxicity 3atobacco 3astress tolerance 3aascorbic acid 3aoxalates 3atransgenic plants 3aexudation 3aphotosystem II 3aaluminum 0aantioxidants1 aQin, Chao1 aLin, Ling1 aZeng, Xueyi1 aZhao, Yaqing1 aHe, Sijian1 aLu, Shaoyun1 aGuo, Zhenfei0 tPlant molecular biology reporter.g2015 Aug., v. 33, no. 4 p.806-818dSpringer USx0735-96407nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11105-014-0794-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03219naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100002100141245015400162300001800316500001900334520166800353592002802021650001502049650001002064650001202074650001502086650001402101650001002115650001802125650001402143650001002157650002202167650001502189650002002204650002702224650001902251651001002270651002102280651001102301653001702312653002002329653001802349700002102367700001602388700001902404700001902423700001702442773014602459856007502605852000902680655001202689IND60725664420221118193354.0210128e20200903xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072566442DNAL7 a10.1093/jee/toaa1892doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTsai, Cheng-Lung10aInvasive and Quarantine Risks of Cacopsylla chinensis (Hemiptera: Psyllidae) in East Asia: Hybridization or Gene Flow Between Differentiated Lineages  ap. 2890-2899.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aPear psyllids are major pests and the causal agents of pear decline disease in orchards. In the past two decades, their outbreaks have raised issues pertaining to invasions and taxonomic identification of the dimorphic Cacopsylla chinensis (Yang and Li) in East Asia. The present study elucidated, as an aid to quarantine management, the invasive origins, differentiation history, and putative gene flow and hybridization between C. chinensis and its sibling species Cacopsylla jukyungi (Kwon). Analyses revealed that the ancestors of C. jukyungi might have diverged from C. chinensis approximately 3.5 million yr ago (Mya) and that differentiation between C. chinensis lineages I and II probably occurred 1.5 Mya. The known overlapping distribution of C. chinensis and C. jukyungi in northeastern China and the two C. chinensis lineages in the Bohai Rim region and Taiwan could be attributed to recent population expansion after the Last Glacial Maximum and/or anthropogenic activities. Analyses of the nuclear gene demonstrated that frequent gene flow between the two C. chinensis lineages and the paraphyletic relationship between C. chinensis and C. jukyungi might be caused by incomplete lineage sorting or hybridization events. On the basis of the current distribution, it is evident that C. jukyungi is not present in middle-southern China, whereas C. chinensis is not distributed in Japan and Korea. Preventing new invasions of Cacopsylla psyllids among geographic regions through the transportation of pear scions is thus pivotal in East Asia, particularly for the possible genetic exchanges among differentiated lineages after secondary invasion events.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCacopsylla 3aJapan 3adecline 3aentomology 3agene flow 3agenes 3ahybridization 3aparaphyly 3apears 3apopulation growth 3aquarantine 3asibling species 3aspecies identification 3atransportation 3aChina 3aKorean Peninsula 3aTaiwan 0apear psyllid 0apest management 0apest invasion1 aLee, Hsien-Chung1 aCho, Geonho1 aLiao, Yi-Chang1 aYang, Man-Miao1 aYeh, Wen-Bin0 tJournal of economic entomology.g2020 Sept. 3, v. 113, no. 6 p.2890-2899dEntomological Society of AmericawJournal:jnl46276x0022-04937nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jee/toaa1893Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02145naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001500147245009300162300001400255520108700269592002801356650002601384650001601410650001301426650001601439650001701455650002401472650002201496650001301518650002901531650001301560650001201573700001901585773008901604856008101693852000901774655001201783IND60573956620221120182838.0170725e201701  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057395662DNAL7 a10.1007/s00284-016-1153-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Kang10aEngineering Plasmid-Free Klebsiella Pneumoniae for Production of 3-Hydroxypropionic Acid  ap. 55-58.  aAlthough plasmid-dependent microbial breeding is predominant in manufacturing bio-based chemicals, it shows pitfall of genetic instability and thus hinders industrial production. Alternatively, chromosome engineering free from plasmid enables genetic stability and thus represents the new trend of microbial breeding. 3-Hydroxypropionic acid (3-HP) is an economically important platform compound as the versatile precursor of a suite of C3 compound, such as 1, 3-PDO. Klebsiella pneumoniae is regarded as a promising host strain due to both its dha regulon and exceptional glycerol fermentation ability. To produce 3-HP in K. pneumoniae, the IS1 region in chromosome was replaced with the AD DNA cassette containing aldH gene from E.coli through homologous recombination approach. The engineered recombinant converted glycerol into 3-HPA and then 3-HP when 40 g/L of initial glycerol was added. The novelties of this study comprise (i) the genetic stability of plasmid-free strains (ii) without using any inducer and antibiotics and thus more applicable than plasmid-based strains.  aPublisher supplied data 3aKlebsiella pneumoniae 3aantibiotics 3abreeding 3achromosomes 3afermentation 3agenetic engineering 3agenetic stability 3aglycerol 3ahomologous recombination 3aplasmids 3aregulon1 aTian, Pingfang0 tCurrent microbiology.g2017 Jan., v. 74, no. 1 p.55-58dSpringer USx0343-86517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00284-016-1153-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03300naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002500153245010700178300001400285520170000299592002801999650001402027650001102041650001702052650001702069650001202086650001902098650001202117650001502129650001402144650001702158650001902175650002002194650001102214650002902225650004302254650002502297651001102322651003102333653002602364653003102390653001902421653002302440653002702463653001202490700002102502700002502523773012502548856008802673852000902761655001202770IND60569244720221122091113.0190318e20171015xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056924472DNAL7 a10.1016/j.agrformet.2017.05.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMekonnen, Zelalem A.10aCarbon sources and sinks of North America as affected by major drought events during the past 30 years  ap. 42-56.  aThe North American (NA) terrestrial biosphere has been a long-term carbon sink but impacts of climate extremes such as drought on ecosystem carbon exchange remain largely uncertain. Here, changes in biospheric carbon fluxes with recent climate change and impacts of the major droughts of the past 30 years on continental carbon cycle across NA were studied using a comprehensive mathematical process model, ecosys. In test of these model responses at continental scale, the spatial anomalies in modeled leaf area indices, fully prognostic in the model, from long-term (1980–2010) means during major drought events in 1988 and 2002 agreed well with those in AVHRR NDVI (R2=0.84 in 1988, 0.71 in 2002). Net ecosystem productivity (NEP) modeled across NA declined by 92% (0.50PgC yr−1) and 90% (0.49PgC yr−1) from the long-term mean (+0.54PgC yr−1), in 1988 and 2002 respectively. These significant drops in NEP offset 28% of the carbon gains modeled over the last three decades. Although the long-term average modeled terrestrial carbon sink was estimated to offset ∼30% of the fossil fuel emissions of NA, only 0.03% and 3.2% were offset in 1988 and 2002 leaving almost all fossil fuel emissions to the atmosphere. These major drought events controlled much of the continental-scale interannual variability and mainly occurred in parts of the Great Plains, southwest US and northern Mexico. Although warming in northern ecosystems caused increasing carbon sinks to be modeled as a result of greater gross primary productivity with longer growing seasons, elsewhere in the continent frequent drought events of the past 30 years reduced carbon uptake and hence net carbon sinks of the NA.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiosphere 3acarbon 3acarbon cycle 3acarbon sinks 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3adrought 3aecosystems 3aemissions 3afossil fuels 3agrowing season 3aleaf area index 3amodels 3anet ecosystem production 3anormalized difference vegetation index 3aprimary productivity 3aMexico 3aSouthwestern United States 0aNorth America drought 0aNorth America carbon cycle 0aClimate change 0aEcosystem modeling 0aCarbon source and sink 0aecossys1 aGrant, Robert F.1 aSchwalm, Christopher0 tAgricultural and forest meteorology.g2017 Oct. 15, v. 244-245 p.42-56dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl43250x0168-19237nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agrformet.2017.05.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03547naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245013000168300001400298520187600312592002802188650002102216650002402237650002202261650002602283650002902309650001702338650001102355650002102366650001702387650003202404650001902436650001902455650001802474650001602492650000902508650001102517650001702528650001802545650001402563650002602577650002802603650002302631650003602654650003202690650002702722700001902749700002202768700002402790773008902814856008102903852000902984655001202993IND60573956720221120182910.0170725e201701  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057395672DNAL7 a10.1007/s00284-016-1151-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPramanik, Asmita10aCoccinia grandis (L.) Voigt Leaf Extract Exhibits Antileishmanial Effect Through Pro-inflammatory Response: An In Vitro Study  ap. 59-67.  aThe conventional drugs used for the treatment of human visceral leishmaniasis have concerns about the toxicity and most importantly parasite resistance. To overcome these troubles, more efforts are made for the development of innovative therapeutic agents having effective antileishmanial activity and simultaneously stimulate adaptive immune system of host cells. Hence, search for new leishmanicidal from the natural origin like plants has shown its effectiveness for the treatment of this tropical disease. The aim of this study is to investigate and characterize the antileishmanial efficacy of Coccinia grandis (L.) Voigt leaf extract (Cg-Ex) with its immunomodulatory property against Leishmania donovani in an in vitro experimental model. Cg-Ex significantly reduces the intracellular L. donovani parasite load with IC₅₀ value 193 ± 0.78 µg/ml, but it has lower cytotoxicity on the murine RAW 264.7 macrophage cell line. Interestingly, Cg-Ex induces the generation of potent antimicrobials like reactive oxygen species and nitric oxide dose dependently in infected murine macrophages. Moreover, the increased production of Th1 cytokines (IL-12, TNF-α) with a concurrent decrease of Th2 cytokines (IL-10, TGF-β) was also observed in Cg-Ex-treated infected host macrophages. Our results thus confirm that serine protease inhibitor(s)-rich Cg-Ex exhibits antileishmanial activity in vitro, and this was mediated through the modulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines. On the whole, the present findings first demonstrate the antileishmanial property of Cg-Ex targeting the Leishmania serine protease resulting protection of host cells with Th1 cytokine expression. Thus, these data indicate that C. grandis leaf extract (Cg-Ex) might be considered as a new lead for designing alternative and novel natural therapeutic against visceral leishmaniasis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCoccinia grandis 3aLeishmania donovani 3aadaptive immunity 3aanti-infective agents 3aantiparasitic properties 3acytotoxicity 3ahumans 3aimmunomodulators 3ainflammation 3ainhibitory concentration 50 3ainterleukin-10 3ainterleukin-12 3aleaf extracts 3amacrophages 3amice 3amodels 3anitric oxide 3aparasite load 3aparasites 3aproteinase inhibitors 3areactive oxygen species 3aserine proteinases 3atransforming growth factor beta 3atumor necrosis factor-alpha 3avisceral leishmaniasis1 aPaik, Dibyendu1 aNaskar, Kshudiram1 aChakraborti, Tapati0 tCurrent microbiology.g2017 Jan., v. 74, no. 1 p.59-67dSpringer USx0343-86517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00284-016-1151-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03511naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001700152245014500169500001900314520205200333592002802385650001202413650001202425650001602437650001302453650001302466650001702479650001502496650001502511650001702526650002202543650001702565651001002582651001802592653000902610653001502619653002802634653002602662653003502688700001502723700001502738700001202753700001702765700001802782773012102800856008702921852000903008655001203017IND60700382720221120074704.0200809e20201001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070038272DNAL7 a10.1016/j.atmosenv.2020.1177252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShi, Xiaowen10aBudget of nitrous acid and its impacts on atmospheric oxidative capacity at an urban site in the central Yangtze River Delta region of China  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aIn this study, we used a wet chemistry based long-path absorption spectroscopy method to measure HONO in Changzhou, in the central Yangtze River Delta region (YRD) of China, from April 3–24, 2017. During the observation period, the average HONO mixing ratio was 1.55 ± 1.21 ppbv. In addition, the average OH formation rates of the photolysis of HONO, O₃, HCHO and H₂O₂ along with ozonolysis of alkenes were 7.84 × 10⁶, 2.02 × 10⁷, 7.41 × 10⁵, 3.79 × 10⁵ and 1.51 × 10⁶ molecules cm⁻³ s⁻¹, respectively. At nighttime, the average conversion rate from NO₂ to HONO was determined to be ~0.018 h⁻¹. In this work, the primary emission rate of HONO was determined by the ratios of HONO to nitrogen oxides (NOₓ = NO + NO₂) within freshly emitted plumes (NO/NOₓ > 0.85) and a value of ~0.69% was obtained. The sources of HONO were further investigated through a box model utilizing the Master Chemical Mechanism. The simulation results show that primary emissions contributed only ~12.3% of the total HONO budget during daytime but a substantial portion (31.4%) at night. Comparing to heterogeneous HONO sources, the gas-phase NO + OH reaction was the less important HONO source, with a contribution of 14.2% at night and 28.7% during the daytime. Heterogeneous reactions of NO₂ on various surfaces (mostly the ground surface) were responsible for most of the observed HONO, i.e., 34.7% during the day and 54.4% at night. Overall, nighttime HONO can be reasonably explained by aforementioned mechanisms. However, daytime HONO cannot be fully accounted for without the consideration of nitrate photolysis, which contributed ~24.1% of the daytime HONO according to the model simulation. Our findings highlight that photolysis of particulate nitrate could be an important source of daytime HONO, providing a channel to cycle NO and OH radical back into the photochemical system and further enhancing the atmospheric oxidative capacity within the air shed of a typical industrial zone of China.  aPublisher supplied data 3aairshed 3aalkenes 3aenvironment 3anitrates 3anitrogen 3anitrous acid 3aozonolysis 3aphotolysis 3ariver deltas 3asimulation models 3aspectroscopy 3aChina 3aYangtze River 0aHONO 0aOH radical 0aHeterogeneous chemistry 0aPhotolysis of nitrate 0aAtmospheric oxidative capacity1 aGe, Yifeng1 aZheng, Jun1 aMa, Yan1 aRen, Xinrong1 aZhang, Yuchan0 tAtmospheric environment.g2020 Oct. 01, v. 238 p.117725-dElsevier LtdaElsevier LtdwJournal:12031x1352-23107nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.atmosenv.2020.1177253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02135naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002100150245005700171300001400228520115100242592002801393650001601421650001101437650001101448650001601459650001801475650000901493653001601502653001101518653001201529653001101541653000901552700001901561700002201580773009901602856005101701852000901752655001201761IND50076360120221117030802.0140410e20130102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007636012DNAL7 a10.1080/07373937.2012.7134212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aElustondo, Diego10aVisual Method to Assess Lumber Sorting Before Drying  ap. 32-39.  aThis article explores the possibility of using a simplified but intuitive method to quickly assess the potential benefits of sorting lumber before industrial kiln drying. The method consists of using scatter plots to visualize the probability of obtaining a certain drying result, such as final moisture content, as a function of a property of the green lumber that can be measured in practice. The method was first validated with four drying runs of 116 mm × 52 mm hemlock lumber: one run contained unsorted lumber and the others contained the same type of lumber but sorted into low, medium, and high groups depending on the electrical capacitance of the green wood. After validation, the scatter plots were used to assess the benefits of two typical industrial sorting strategies, namely, sorting by electric capacitance and sorting by weight. It was found that both methods have the potential to increase lumber production and reduce over dried lumber in approximately the same magnitude. For a typical industrial schedule, sorting into three groups reduced the drying time by approximately 10% and over dried lumber to practically zero.  aPublisher supplied data 3acapacitance 3adrying 3alumber 3aprobability 3awater content 3awood 0aCapacitance 0aDrying 0aSorting 0aWeight 0aWood1 aOliveira, Luiz1 aAnanias, Ruben A.0 tDrying technology.g2013 Jan. 2, v. 31, no. 1 p.32-39dTaylor & Francis Groupx1532-23007nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/07373937.2012.713421  aDNAL 7aarticle03889naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001600152245008800168500001900256520255800275592002802833650001702861650001202878650001402890650001402904650001602918650001602934650001702950650001702967650004302984650001403027650001003041651001003051653000903061653001303070653001703083653001403100653000803114700001603122700001803138700001203156700001803168700001803186773010703204856008703311852000903398655001203407IND60700382820221120065248.0200809e20201001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070038282DNAL7 a10.1016/j.atmosenv.2020.1177262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCao, Xinyue14aThe effects of biodiesel blends on real-world carbonyl emissions from diesel trucks  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThis work assessed the effects of biodiesel on carbonyl emissions from diesel trucks. Biodiesel converted from waste cooking oil was employed and mixed with commercial fossil diesel to produce four blends: B0 (pure conventional diesel fuel), B5 (5% v/v biodiesel), B20 (20% v/v biodiesel) and B100 (pure biodiesel). Four diesel trucks were tested under real-world conditions using a portable emissions measurement system, including one China III light-duty diesel truck (LDDT), one China IV LDDT, one China III heavy-duty diesel truck (HDDT) and one China IV HDDT. A driving cycle including highway (HW) and non-highway (NHW) driving conditions was employed and carbonyls were sampled using 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine cartridges and analyzed via high performance liquid chromatography. Seven carbonyl compounds were detected, and formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, acetone and butyraldehyde were the primary carbonyls. Total carbonyl emissions from the China III LDDT, China III HDDT and China IV HDDT vehicles with selective catalytic reduction decreased monotonically with increases in the biodiesel proportion, while the China IV LDDT with a particle oxidation catalyst system showed an increasing trend. With increases in the biodiesel proportions, complementary variations were observed in the proportions of formaldehyde and butyraldehyde obtained using the China III LDDT, China IV LDDT and China III HDDT vehicles. However, in the case of the China IV HDDT trials, the formaldehyde and acetaldehyde emissions exhibited complementary variations. Under different driving conditions, the effects of adding biodiesel on carbonyl emission factors were different. In China III LDDT trials, biodiesel reduced carbonyl emissions to a greater extent under HW conditions, but the opposite occurred in China III HDDT tests. Using the China IV LDDT vehicle, the emission factors did not increase as much during HW trials compared with NHW trials when the B5 and B20 fuels were used, but were significantly higher than the NHW values when pure biodiesel was employed. In China III LDDT data, the proportions of formaldehyde, acetaldehyde and butyraldehyde showed opposite variations under the two driving conditions. Using the China IV LDDT vehicle, a significant increase in formaldehyde and decrease in butyraldehyde were found during HW trials, but not NHW trials. Ozone formation potentials were obtained from carbonyls emission factors using the maximum incremental reactivity method and their variations were similar to those of the carbonyl emission factors.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetaldehyde 3aacetone 3abiodiesel 3acatalysts 3adiesel fuel 3aenvironment 3aformaldehyde 3afossil fuels 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3aoxidation 3aozone 3aChina 0aPEMS 0aCarbonyl 0aDiesel truck 0aEmissions 0aOFP1 aFeng, Sijie1 aShen, Xianbao1 aLi, Xin1 aYao, Xiaolong1 aYao, Zhiliang0 tAtmospheric environment.g2020 Oct. 01, v. 238 p.117726-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12031x1352-23107nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.atmosenv.2020.1177263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02685naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100002000141245014000161300001800301500001900319520127200338592002801610650002601638650001601664650001501680650001601695650001501711650002801726650001601754650001401770650002201784650001201806650001701818651000901835653001801844653002101862653003601883700002101919700001601940700002101956700001901977773014701996856007502143852000902218655001202227IND60725664820221118193333.0210128e20200912xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072566482DNAL7 a10.1093/jee/toaa1932doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMahmoodi, Leila10aSublethal effects of three insecticides on fitness parameters and population projection of Brevicoryne brassicae (Hemiptera: Aphididae)  ap. 2713-2722.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe cabbage aphid, Brevicoryne brassicae (L.), is one of the major insect pests of cole crops in Iran. In most instances outbreaks are normally kept under control by application of insecticides. In this study, the sublethal effects (LC₃₀) of three insecticides, acetamiprid, buprofezin, and thiamethoxam-lambda cyhalothrin, (TLC) were evaluated on the population growth rate of the progeny of insecticide-treated cabbage aphid adults. The age-stage, two-sex life table method was used to analyze the collected data. The results indicated that the insecticide applications affected the duration of the preadult period, their survival, reproduction, life span/longevity, and consequently, the population growth rate of the F₁ generation. The indicators of the greatest sublethal effects were noted in the progeny of the TLC-treated adults. These included the lowest net reproductive rate (R₀), intrinsic rate of increase (r), finite rate of increase (λ), and the longest mean generation time (T). The highest values of r, λ, R, and the lowest value of T occurred in the control group followed by, in order, the acetamiprid and buprofezin groups. These research findings will be useful in the development and implementation of future aphid management programs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBrevicoryne brassicae 3aacetamiprid 3abuprofezin 3acyhalothrin 3aentomology 3ainsecticide application 3alife tables 3alongevity 3apopulation growth 3aprogeny 3areproduction 3aIran 0acabbage aphid 0asublethal effect 0athiamethoxam-lambda cyhalothrin1 aMehrkhou, Fariba1 aGuz, Nurper1 aForouzan, Maryam1 aAtlihan, Remzi0 tJournal of economic entomology.g2020 Sept. 12, v. 113, no. 6 p.2713-2722dEntomological Society of AmericawJournal:jnl46276x0022-04937nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jee/toaa1933Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03374naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001900146245010700165300002000272520191600292592002802208650002202236650002302258650001402281650002702295650002202322650001602344650001102360650001502371650001502386650001802401650001402419650002002433650001402453650001502467650001802482650001802500650001302518650002502531650002102556650001402577700002102591700001802612700002302630773013602653856008202789852000902871655001202880IND60559338720221123015655.0161207e20161207xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055933872DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.iecr.6b031612doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKhairul, M. A.10aExperimental Study on Fundamental Mechanisms of Ferro-Fluidics for an Electromagnetic Energy Harvester  ap. 12491-12501.  aFerrofluids are a unique class of colloidal liquids made of ferromagnetic or ferrimagnetic nanoparticles suspended in a carrier fluid. Ferrofluids have drawn considerable attention due to the possibility of tuning their heat transfer and flow properties through the application of an external magnetic field. They can also be utilized to improve the performance of an energy harvester, which can supply power and enhance the capability, assertion and lifespan of those devices where batteries or direct electricity are currently used as the primary source of power. Electromagnetic ferrofluid based energy harvesters convert the ferrofluids sloshing movement into electromotive force; therefore, it is necessary to estimate the feasibility, stability and efficacy of ferrofluids through several physicochemical studies. The objective of this work is to prepare a stable polymer coated Fe₃O₄ nanofluid with the aim of applying it in a novel energy harvester device currently under development at the University of Newcastle. The one-step chemical precipitation method was complied with to produce Fe₃O₄/DI-water nanofluids, and thermogravimetric analysis and differential thermal gravimetry have been carried out to determine the chemical and physical changes of ferrofluids due to thermal effect. Besides, X-ray diffraction was employed to identify the crystal structure. The stability and physicochemical properties of Fe₃O₄ particles were also investigated. The synthesized ferrofluids were found to be visually stable for more than 2 months. The results showed that the synthesized nanoparticles were magnetite, and a linear relationship was found among the dosing rate of ammonium hydroxide, nanoparticle size distribution, viscosity and thermal conductivity. Higher dosing rates of ammonium hydroxide reagent during the preparation of nanoparticles resulted in increasing average particle size.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3aammonium hydroxide 3abatteries 3achemical precipitation 3acrystal structure 3aelectricity 3aenergy 3agravimetry 3aharvesters 3aheat transfer 3alongevity 3amagnetic fields 3amagnetite 3ananofluids 3ananoparticles 3aparticle size 3apolymers 3athermal conductivity 3athermogravimetry 3aviscosity1 aDoroodchi, Elham1 aAzizian, Reza1 aMoghtaderi, Behdad0 tIndustrial & Engineering Chemistry Research.g2016 Dec. 07, v. 55, no. 48 p.12491-12501dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-50457nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.iecr.6b031613Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02533naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002000145245010900165300001500274500001500289520143800304592002801742650001301770650002601783650001101809650001301820650001601833650001601849650001201865650001201877650001301889650001001902650001101912650001101923653001501934700002201949773010701971856004802078852000902126655001202135IND4465755820221118181048.0121003e201110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446575582DNAL7 a10.1007/s11270-011-0772-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBaud, Donald R.10aRoot Porosity Changes in Salix nigra Cuttings in Response to Copper and Ultraviolet-B Radiation Exposure  ap. 99-105.  a2019-12-06  aCuttings of black willow (Salix nigra), a naturally occurring wetland species, are used for restoration and streambank stabilization. As an adaptation to their wetland habitat, this species develops aerenchyma tissue to avoid root anoxia. To determine the effects of combined copper and ultraviolet-B radiation exposure on aerenchyma tissue (measured as root porosity), black willow cuttings were grown hydroponically and exposed to three ultraviolet-B (UV-B) intensities and three Cu concentrations in a completely randomized 3âÃâ3 factorial design. While both UV-B (F 2,42â=â11.45; pâ=â0.0001) and Cu (F 2,42â=â6.14; pâ=â0.0046) exposure increased root porosity, total biomass decreased in response to both UV-B (F 2,43â=â3.36; pâ=â0.0441) and to Cu (F 2,43â=â4.03; pâ=â0.0249). Root biomass decreased only in response to Cu (F 2,41â=â3.41; pâ=â0.0427) resulting in a decrease in the root/shoot ratio (F 2,42â=â3.5; pâ=â0.0393). Copper exposure also resulted in a decrease in the number of leaves/shoot (F 2,42â=â7.03; Pâ=â0.0023). No UV-B and Cu interaction was found. While the present research indicates the negative effects of Cu contamination and elevated UV-B intensities on S. nigra, it also points out potential mechanisms that S. nigra uses to alleviate these stresses.  aPublisher supplied data 3awetlands 3aultraviolet radiation 3acopper 3aporosity 3ahydroponics 3aSalix nigra 3abiomass 3ahypoxia 3ahabitats 3aroots 3aleaves 3ashoots 0aadaptation1 aPezeshki, S.

X-ray crystallography reveals that the macrocyclic β-sheet assembles to form double-walled nanotubes, with an inner diameter of 7 nm and outer diameter of 11 nm. The inner wall is composed of an extended network of hydrogen-bonded dimers. The outer wall is composed of a separate extended network of β-barrel-like tetramers. These large peptide nanotubes pack into a hexagonal lattice that resembles a honeycomb. The complexity and size of the peptide nanotubes rivals some of the largest tubular biomolecular assemblies, such as GroEL and microtubules. These observations demonstrate that small amyloidogenic sequences can be used to build large nanostructures.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3ahydrogen bonding 3amicrotubules 3ananotubes1 aCorro, Kelsey A.1 aLe, Stephanie P.1 aNowick, James S.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2273-10290 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2017 June 21, v. 139, no. 24 p.8102-8105dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19166x1520-51267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jacs.7b038903Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03413naa a2200661 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094024002200133024001900155040001800174100001800192245011900210300001400329506007600343520144700419592002801866506003701894650002801931650002101959650001701980650001601997650001702013650002002030650001602050650001902066650001902085650000902104650001302113650001102126650001902137650003402156650001302190650001802203650001202221650001302233653001402246653002102260653002102281653001602302653001602318700001602334700001702350700001802367700001702385700002802402700001802430700001702448700001902465700002502484700002602509700001302535773009702548856008502645852000902730655001202739IND60569245120221207133734.0170708e20170728xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056924512DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jconrel.2017.05.0062doi7 aPMC55255422pmcid7 a285017052pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSun, Jingjing10aDoxorubicin delivered by a redox-responsive dasatinib-containing polymeric prodrug carrier for combination therapy  ap. 43-55.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aTwo novel prodrug polymers POEG-b-PSSDas (redox-sensitive) and POEG-b-PCCDas (redox-insensitive), which consist of poly(oligo(ethylene glycol) methacrylate) (POEG) hydrophilic blocks and dasatinib (DAS, an oncogenic tyrosine kinases inhibitor) conjugated hydrophobic blocks, were designed as dual-functional carriers for codelivery with doxorubicin (DOX). Both carriers retained antitumor activity of DAS and could form mixed micelles with DOX. Compared to POEG-b-PCCDas micelles, incorporation of disulfide linkage into POEG-b-PSSDas micelles facilitated efficient cleavage of DAS from prodrug micelles in tumor cells/tissues, leading to a higher level of anti-tumor activity in vitro and in vivo. In addition, DOX-loaded POEG-b-PSSDas micelles exhibited triggered DOX release under a redox environment (10mM glutathione, GSH), and demonstrated enhanced cytotoxicity against 4T1.2 and PC3 cell lines compared to DOX and DOX-loaded POEG-b-PCCDas micelles. More importantly, DOX-loaded POEG-b-PSSDas micelles were more effective in inhibiting the tumor growth and prolonging the survival rate in an aggressive murine breast cancer model (4T1.2) compared to DOX-loaded POEG-b-PCCDas micelles and a micellar formulation co-loaded with DOX and DAS. This redox-responsive prodrug micellar system provides an attractive strategy for effective combination of tumor targeted therapy and traditional chemotherapy, which warrants further investigation.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aantineoplastic activity 3abreast neoplasms 3acytotoxicity 3adoxorubicin 3adrug therapy 3aethylene glycol 3aglutathione 3ahydrophilicity 3ahydrophobicity 3amice 3amicelles 3amodels 3aneoplasm cells 3aphosphotransferases (kinases) 3apolymers 3asurvival rate 3atissues 3atyrosine 0aDasatinib 0aProdrug micelles 0aRedox responsive 0aDoxorubicin 0aCo-delivery1 aLiu, Yanhua1 aChen, Yichao1 aZhao, Wenchen1 aZhai, Qianyu1 aRāṭhoḍa, Sañjaya,1 aHuang, Yixian1 aTang, Suoqin1 aKwon, Yong Tae1 aFernandez, Christian1 aVenkataramanan, Raman1 aLi, Song0 tJournal of Controlled Release.g2017 July 28, v. 258 p.43-55dElsevier B.V.x0168-36597nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jconrel.2017.05.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02593naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002800151245013600179520129300315592002801608650001301636650001201649650002201661650001801683650001401701650001401715650002601729650001101755650002001766650002801786653002201814653004301836653004001879653001701919653001901936700001701955700002301972773009301995856008602088852000902174655001202183IND60692516120221119220205.0201223e20200901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069251612DNAL7 a10.1016/j.talanta.2020.1211102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAtaş, Havva Bekiroğlu13aAn electronic tongue for simultaneous determination of Ca2+, Mg2+, K+ and NH4+ in water samples by multivariate calibration methods  aIn this study, a multi ion-selective electrode system was developed for simultaneous determination of Ca²⁺, Mg²⁺, K⁺ and NH₄⁺ ions. The system, called electronic tongue, was used for the quantitative determination of these ions in different water samples. The measurement system was comprised of sixteen ion-selective electrodes, an Ag/AgCl double-junction reference electrode, and a sixteen-channel multi-potentiometer. In the fabrication process of the electronic tongue, an electrode body, which comprised eight ion-selective electrodes together on it, was designed. The obtained data were evaluated by using multivariate calibration methods such as Classical Least Squares (CLS), Principal Component Regression (PCR) and Partial Least Squares (PLS1). The parameters that influence the electronic tongue performance were investigated. Analyses were conducted in synthetic water samples and real water samples. Percentage recovery values in synthetic samples, which were calculated via PLS1, were found 101.35%, 102.41%, 100.04% and 99.23% for Ca²⁺, Mg²⁺, K⁺ and NH₄⁺ respectively. The results, obtained from the electronic tongue and other analytical techniques, were compared and no significant difference was found between the results at 95% confidence level.  aPublisher supplied data 3aammonium 3acalcium 3aelectronic tongue 3aleast squares 3amagnesium 3apotassium 3aquantitative analysis 3asilver 3asilver chloride 3aspecific ion electrodes 0aElectronic tongue 0aMultiple ion-selective electrode array 0aMultivariate calibration techniques 0aChemometrics 0aWater analysis1 aKenar, Adnan1 aTaştekin, Mustafa0 tTalanta.g2020 Sept. 01, v. 217 p.121110-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11742x0039-91407nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.talanta.2020.1211103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03111naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001400140245013800154520186400292592002802156650001102184650002002195650001402215650000902229650000902238650001502247650002202262650002502284650002802309650002302337650001502360651001002375651001502385700001702400700001502417700001602432700001602448700001602464773012602480856007402606852000902680655001202689IND60652282220221119080642.0190712e20180502xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065228222DNAL7 a10.3390/su100513962doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFan, Jiao10aTrend Analyses of Extreme Precipitation Events in the Yarlung Zangbo River Basin, China Using a High-Resolution Precipitation Product  aThe Yarlung Zangbo River Basin (YZRB) is an important transboundary river basin in Tibet, China with south Asian countries. Changes in precipitation are important driving factors of river flow changes. Extreme Precipitation Events (EPE), in particular, have serious impacts on human life and sustainable development. The objective of this study is to explore the temporal changes and the spatial distribution of EPE over the YZRB in recent decades using a precipitation product with a 5 km spatial resolution and the Mann&ndash;Kendall nonparametric statistical test method. A more thorough understanding of the spatial heterogeneity in precipitation was expected from using this high resolution dataset. At both basin and pixel scale, both annual precipitation amounts and number of rain days had significant upward trends, indicating that the increase in the number of rain days is one possible cause of the annual precipitation amounts increases. The annual precipitation and number of rain days increased significantly in 50.8% and 75.8% of the basin area, respectively. The areas showing upward trends for the two indexes mostly overlapped, supporting the hypothesis that the increasing number of rain days is one possible cause of the increases in annual precipitation in these areas. General precipitation intensity and EPE intensity increased in the Lhasa regions and in the southern part of the lower-reach region. However, the intensity of general precipitation and EPE decreased in the Nyangqu River Basin. A total of 43.0% of the area in the YZRB exhibits significant upward trends in EPE frequency. The contributions of EPE to total rainfall increase significantly in the Lhasa and Shannan regions. Overall, it was shown that the risk of disasters from EPE in the YZRB increases in the eastern middle-reach region and southern lower-reach region.  aPublisher supplied data 3abasins 3adata collection 3adisasters 3arain 3arisk 3ariver flow 3aspatial variation 3astatistical analysis 3asustainable development 3atemporal variation 3awatersheds 3aChina 3aSouth Asia1 aSun, Wenchao1 aZhao, Yong1 aXue, Baolin1 aZuo, Depeng1 aXu, Zongxue0 tSustainability.g2018 May 02, v. 10, no. 5dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2270x2071-10507nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su100513963Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01885naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001600150245006000166300001400226520082400240592002801064650001101092650001801103650000901121650001101130650001101141650001301152650001301165650001701178653002001195653001401215653002601229653001801255700001401273700002101287700002001308773009901328856005101427852000901478655001201487IND50076360520221120201426.0140410e20130102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007636052DNAL7 a10.1080/07373937.2012.7173262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZeng, Qiang10aWater Removal by Freeze-Drying of Hardened Cement Paste  ap. 67-71.  aThis paper investigates the water removal extent of freeze-drying (F-drying) technique on hardened cement pastes. Two cement pastes with w/c = 0.5, 0.3 were prepared, and the authors measured the hydration degree, specific surface area, porosity, and solid skeleton density of the material samples at curing ages from 7 days to 180 days. From these results, the C-S-H gel volumes of samples are predicted from Jennings model and also evaluated from drying data. The good agreement between the results of two approaches confirms that F-drying removes only partially the water in gel pores of LD C-S-H structure. At the age of 180 days, the residual porosity saturated by water after F-drying is evaluated as 28% (w/c = 0.5) and 55% (w/c = 0.3) with dried C-S-H estimated as 28% (w/c = 0.5) and 13% (w/c = 0.3).  aPublisher supplied data 3acement 3afreeze drying 3agels 3amodels 3apastes 3aporosity 3askeleton 3asurface area 0aFreezing-drying 0aHydration 0aSpecific surface area 0aWater removal1 aLi, Kefei1 aFen-Chong, Teddy1 aDangla, Patrick0 tDrying technology.g2013 Jan. 2, v. 31, no. 1 p.67-71dTaylor & Francis Groupx1532-23007nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/07373937.2012.717326  aDNAL 7aarticle03170naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002100150245012000171300001600291520174000307592002802047650001102075650002102086650002402107650002302131650001102154650000902165650002102174650001502195650002302210650001602233650002102249650001702270650002102287651001002308653001302318653001502331653002302346653001702369700001902386700002102405700002202426700001902448700001902467773009602486856008502582852000902667655001202676IND60751926920221120212633.0211017e202111  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075192692DNAL7 a10.1016/j.wasman.2021.09.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGreggio, Nicolas10aQuantification and mapping of fish waste in retail trade and restaurant sector: Experience in Emilia-Romagna, Italy  ap. 256-266.  aThe circular economy approach imposes the complete recovery of components, materials and energy from waste. Many active compounds with biomedical and nutraceutical applications can be extracted by Fish Waste (FW), but few are the operating industrial plants. Quantification and mapping of the potential FW availability along the entire fish value-chain is crucial in fostering its actual valorisation. Apart at industrial processing, in the distribution segment the estimation of FW availability is absent. This paper aimed to quantify and locate FW generated by point sources such as supermarkets, fishmongers and restaurants as well as to establish the diffuse domestic FW production in a 4,5M inhabitants region. The study provides an exportable method and indications for comparable worldwide areas. A simplified valorisation scenario for equivalent biomethane production is also presented. Direct interviews and indirect approach based on fish consumption have been adopted and compared. Large supermarkets and medium-large restaurants are the main FW producers (239 and 125 kg/week, respectively) followed medium-large fishmongers and medium supermarkets (63 and 86 kg/week, respectively). In the investigated region the larger FW point sources are supermarkets (average 3000 Mg/y), while fishmongers are the smaller (average 750 Mg/y). Restaurants (average 1400 Mg/y) show the wider range of variability between 460 and 8000 Mg/y. The indirect methodology reveals that domestic FW production ranges from 2376 to 3961 Mg/y. Per capita estimations of FW ranged from 0.5 − 3 kg/y. The economic value of FW (biomethanation route) is 68 EUR/Mg. A qualification as “highly potential waste” would promote FW valorization.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiogas 3acircular economy 3adietary supplements 3aeconomic valuation 3aenergy 3afish 3afish consumption 3afish waste 3amethane production 3arestaurants 3aretail marketing 3asupply chain 3awaste management 3aItaly 0aBiowaste 0aFood waste 0aWaste flow mapping 0aUrban mining1 aSerafini, Alba1 aBalugani, Enrico1 aCarlini, Carlotta1 aContin, Andrea1 aMarazza, Diego0 tWaste management.g2021 Nov., v. 135 p.256-266dElsevier LtdwJournal:6325x0956-053X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2021.09.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01955naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100001500112245007100127300001600198520088000214592002801094650001501122650001601137650001201153650001501165650001701180650001501197650001601212650002601228650002701254650002201281651001001303653001501313653001501328653001501343700001601358700001401374700001501388773014501403852000901548655001201557IND60705804020221118122016.0200807e201512  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070580402DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDhaka, B L10aPesticide application behaviour of farmers in vegetable production  ap. 439-442.  aThe present study wasconducted to examine the pesticide application behaviour of farmers with respect to vegetable production in Bundi district of Rajasthan in India.

It is known that the traditional methods are heavy, time-consuming, and need a high level of logistical requirements. As such, biosensors represent great potential to simplify and improve substance abuse detection. In this study, we have designed a functionalized screen-printed electrode (SPE) electrochemical biosensor with cobalt oxide nanoparticles and single-chain antibody fragments (scFvs) for cocaine detection. Different electrochemical techniques such as differential pulse voltammetry, cyclic voltammetry, and electrochemical impedance spectrometry were used to examine the functionality of the designed biosensor. Furthermore, SEM observations were performed to observe the surface changes after functionalization. The results showed that the linearity ranged between 5.0 and 250 ng/mL and a detection limit of 3.6 ng/mL (n = 6). These results were compared to results obtained from Q-TOF/MS where four different matrices (serum, sweat, urine, and saliva) were spiked with 100 ng/mL cocaine and were analyzed by both methods (Biosensor and Q-TOF/MS). Results showed a higher performance of the biosensor compared to traditional methods. In addition, the selectivity of the biosensor was shown in the presence of different interferents where the designed platform showed a specific response to only cocaine. In conclusion, the designed biosensor proposes great potential for portable and on-site substance abuse detection in addition to boasting the capability of reuse of the SPE and thus, reducing the costs related to such applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantibodies 3abiosensors 3ablood serum 3acobalt 3acobalt oxide 3acocaine 3adetection limit 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrodes 3amagnetism 3ananoparticles 3asaliva 3ascanning electron microscopy 3aspectroscopy 3asubstance abuse 3asweat 3aurine 3avoltammetry 0aBiosensor 0aCobalt oxide particle 0aSingle-chain Fv antibody 0aSubstance abuse 0aCocaine1 aMoulahoum, Hichem1 aUgurlu, Ozge1 aGhorbanizamani, Faezeh1 aGumus, Zinar Pinar1 aEvran, Serap1 aCoskunol, Hakan1 aTimur, Suna0 tTalanta.g2020 Sept. 01, v. 217 p.121111-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11742x0039-91407nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.talanta.2020.1211113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02223naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002100140245008500161520120300246592002801449650005801477650001101535650001901546650000901565650002001574650002001594650001701614700001901631700001801650700002001668773012601688856007401814852000901888655001201897IND60652282320221119080631.0190712e20180502xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065228232DNAL7 a10.3390/su100513992doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aConnelly, Angela10aEnhancing the Practical Utility of Risk Assessments in Climate Change Adaptation  aIn 2012, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) moved from a vulnerability to a risk-based conception of climate change adaptation. However, there are few examples of work that translates this approach into climate change adaptation practice, in order to demonstrate the practical utility of following a risk-based approach to adapting to climate change. The paper explores critically the differing conceptions of vulnerability and risk across the literature relating to disaster risk management and climate change adaptation. The paper also examines a selection of spatially focused climate change vulnerability and risk assessment methodologies in this context. In doing so, we identify issues with the availability of spatial data to enable spatial risk-based climate change assessments. We argue that the concept of risk is potentially favorable in helping cities to understand the challenges posed by climate change, identify adaptation options, and build resilience to the changing climate. However, we suggest that change is needed in the way that practitioners and policymakers engage with risk-based concepts if they are to be embed into climate change adaptation activities.  aPublisher supplied data 3aUnited Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change 3acities 3aclimate change 3arisk 3arisk assessment 3arisk management 3aspatial data1 aCarter, Jeremy1 aHandley, John1 aHincks, Stephen0 tSustainability.g2018 May 02, v. 10, no. 5dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2270x2071-10507nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su100513993Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02736naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100005900150245008800209300001600297520154000313592002801853650001301881650002901894650002801923650001101951650001301962650001101975651001201986653003201998653003002030653001402060653002102074700002002095700005702115773009602172856008502268852000902353655001202362IND60751927020221121014048.0211017e202111  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075192702DNAL7 a10.1016/j.wasman.2021.09.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTsydenova, Nina1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0973-619910aOptimised design of concrete recycling networks: The case of North Rhine-Westphalia  ap. 309-317.  aIn Germany, construction and demolition waste is either landfilled or used for roadworks after being treated in recycling plants. However, recycled concrete aggregates from building demolition can be reused for the construction of new buildings, which allows to close the material loop of concrete. The aim of this study is to develop a decision support system (DSS) in order to investigate the economic impacts and consequences of recycling concrete from building demolition in a closed loop material cycle. To do so, we propose a bi-objective mixed-integer linear optimisation model that provides information on the number and location of installed sorting screens and defines the material flows within a comprehensive regional recycling network covering all processes from building demolition to construction of new buildings. While the economic objective function minimises the total costs of the recycling network, the circularity objective function minimises the amount of primary natural aggregates required for concrete manufacturing. We apply our optimisation model to the German federal state of North Rhine-Westphalia. Results show that under current conditions the manufacturing of concrete with recycled concrete aggregates is economically viable predominantly in areas without local supplies of natural aggregates. In addition, analysis of the trade-offs between the two objectives as well as recommendations on the design of political regulations and economic instruments to foster such recycling networks are presented.  aPublisher supplied data 3aconcrete 3adecision support systems 3aeconomic sustainability 3amodels 3apolitics 3awastes 3aGermany 0aConstruction and demolition 0aBi-objective optimisation 0aRecycling 0aDecision support1 aBecker, Tristan1 aWalther, Grit1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0022-90270 tWaste management.g2021 Nov., v. 135 p.309-317dElsevier LtdwJournal:6325x0956-053X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2021.09.0133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03637naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245017000168300001800338520216400356592002802520650002502548650004302573650001302616650001402629650002302643650002002666650002202686650001402708650001802722650002502740650001402765651001402779651001002793651001002803651001602813700001902829700001802848700001902866700001802885700001602903700002102919700002002940773010502960856008103065852000903146655001203155IND60439953120221122100736.0151024e201510  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6043995312DNAL7 a10.1007/s11105-014-0828-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKumar, Shivendra10aAssessment of Genetic Diversity and Population Structure in a Global Reference Collection of 531 Accessions of Carthamus tinctorius L. (Safflower) Using AFLP Markers  ap. 1299-1313.  aCarthamus tinctorius L. (safflower) is an important oilseed crop that is cultivated in several countries. The present study investigates the genetic diversity and population structure of 531 safflower accessions from 43 countries representing all safflower growing regions of the world. Diversity analysis was performed using ten informative EcoRI/MseI amplified fragment length polymorphism primer pairs that were identified by screening 150 primer combinations. The selected primer pairs generated 381 fragments of which 157 were polymorphic among the analyzed accessions. The genetic diversity indices obtained for the entire collection (I = 0.4536, H = 0.2955) indicated high levels of molecular variability. The distance-based, neighbor-joining method classified the accessions into six clusters with internal subgroupings that were in consonance with 19 clusters obtained using Bayesian model-based BAPS analysis. Clusters obtained through STRUCTURE analysis (at K = 4) could not be correlated with their geographically diverse origins, while BAPS analysis (at K = 19) revealed geographical delineation with low admixture levels among most of the studied accessions. Accessions from Far East and Egypt clustered in distinct groups, indicating conserved nature of their gene pools. The Near East and Iran–Afghanistan regions were collectively found to harbor maximum diversity in accordance with earlier reports. Accessions from the Indian subcontinent showed substantial diversity that was previously undetected. The American accessions showed low molecular variability in contrast to earlier studies. Genetic sub-structuring within gene pools and inter-relationships between accessions belonging to different regional pools was also observed. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive study of existing genetic variability in a large collection of safflower germplasm with a global distribution, which provides a more accurate representation of genetic structuring in the crop. This information will facilitate selection of elite genotypes for broadening the genetic base of various breeding programs in safflower.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCarthamus tinctorius 3aamplified fragment length polymorphism 3abreeding 3agene pool 3agenetic background 3agenetic markers 3agenetic variation 3agermplasm 3aoilseed crops 3apopulation structure 3ascreening 3aEast Asia 3aEgypt 3aIndia 3aMiddle East1 aAmbreen, Heena1 aMurali, T.

This work distinguishes the multiple roles of SO₂ in the gas phase versus the solid deposition product and clarifies the effects of the physicochemical properties of AC on NO conversion. The deposition products were detected using temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) coupled with mass spectrum (MS) analysis and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectrometry. The results showed that the activated carbon loses less de-NOₓ activity when it has more CO- and CO₂-containing groups with decomposition temperatures over 900 K. The Raman spectra revealed that the disorder of the microcrystalline structure of the graphite has a positive linear correlation with NO conversion regardless of the presence of functional groups. The deposition products were analyzed by Gaussian-Lorentz deconvolution of the TPD spectra, and it was discovered that the sulfur-containing species included sulfate and strongly adsorbed SO₂/SO₃; the NH₃-containing species included NH₄HSO₄ and freely adsorbed NH₃; and the ratios of SO₂/SO₃, NH₄HSO₄ and NH₃ were approximately 31 mol %, 42 mol %, and 26 mol %, respectively. NH₄HSO₄ does not notably inhibit NO conversion, even with a high loading amount. The inhibitory effect of gaseous SO₂ on NO conversion is reversible, and this inhibitory effect is greater than that caused by the loss of functional groups. Increasing the disorder of the microcrystalline structure of the graphite and reducing the gaseous SO₂ were identified as ways to improve activated carbon activity for NO conversion.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aRaman spectroscopy 3aactivated carbon 3aammonia 3adesorption 3aengineering 3agases 3agraphene 3amoieties 3anitric oxide 3aphysicochemical properties 3asulfates 3asulfur dioxide 3atemperature1 aGuo, Yangyang1 aXiong, Jin1 aZhu, Tingyu1 aHao, Junke0 tIndustrial & Engineering Chemistry Research.g2016 Dec. 07, v. 55, no. 48 p.12341-12349dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-50457nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.iecr.6b032553Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02519naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002600147245012800173300001600301520128900317592002801606650002801634650000901662650001001671650001001681650001601691650001801707650001401725650003001739650002401769650002001793650001201813650001401825650001101839651001201850700002201862700001901884700002101903773008301924856008102007852000902088655001202097IND60439286020221118013334.0151024e200712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6043928602DNAL7 a10.1007/s10393-007-0136-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchlaepfer, Martin A.10aHigh Prevalence of Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis in Wild Populations of Lowland Leopard Frogs Rana yavapaiensis in Arizona  ap. 421-427.  aBatrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd) is a fungus that can potentially lead to chytridiomycosis, an amphibian disease implicated in die-offs and population declines in many regions of the world. Winter field surveys in the last decade have documented die-offs in populations of the lowland leopard frog Rana yavapaiensis with chytridiomycosis. To test whether the fungus persists in host populations between episodes of observed host mortality, we quantified field-based Bd infection rates during nonwinter months. We used PCR to sample for the presence of Bd in live individuals from nine seemingly healthy populations of the lowland leopard frog as well as four of the American bullfrog R. catesbeiana (a putative vector for Bd) from Arizona. We found Bd in 10 of 13 sampled populations. The overall prevalence of Bd was 43% in lowland leopard frogs and 18% in American bullfrogs. Our results suggest that Bd is widespread in Arizona during nonwinter months and may become virulent only in winter in conjunction with other cofactors, or is now benign in these species. The absence of Bd from two populations associated with thermal springs (water >30°C), despite its presence in nearby ambient waters, suggests that these microhabitats represent refugia from Bd and chytridiomycosis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLithobates catesbeianus 3aRana 3afrogs 3afungi 3ahot springs 3amicrohabitats 3amortality 3apolymerase chain reaction 3apopulation dynamics 3arefuge habitats 3asurveys 3avirulence 3awinter 3aArizona1 aSredl, Michael J.1 aRosen, Phil C.1 aRyan, Michael J.0 tEcoHealth.g2007 Dec., v. 4, no. 4 p.421-427dSpringer-Verlagx1612-92027nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10393-007-0136-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01658naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004400094040001800138100001900156245009600175300001600271520062200287592002800909650001500937650001800952650001400970650001700984650002001001650001301021650001201034700001801046700002701064773014201091856009001233852000901323655001201332IND60439286120221118013259.0151024e200409  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6043928612DNAL7 a10.1023/B:ABIM.0000040662.28568.3c2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVolkov, I.

More than 90% of the free forms of all four spiked EDCs were removed from these reactors at the end of 28 days under aerobic conditions, with the half-life of 17α-ethynylestradiol (EE₂) longer than those of propylparaben (PP), nonylphenol (NP) and 17β-estradiol (E₂). The interaction with dissolved oxygen contributed to NP removal and was enhanced by aeration. The PP and E₂ removal was positively influenced by adsorption on suspended particles initially, whereas abiotic transformation by estuarine-dissolved matter contributed to their complete removal. Biotic processes, including degradation by active aquatic microorganisms, had significant effects on the removal of EE₂. Sedimentary inorganic and organic matter posed a positive effect only when EE₂ biodegradation was inhibited. Estrone (E₁), the oxidizing product of E₂, was detected, proving that E₂ was removed by the naturally occurring oxidizers in the estuarine water matrixes. These results revealed that the estuarine aquatic environment was effective in removing free EDCs, and the contributions of abiotic and biotic processes to their removal were compound specific.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3aaeration 3aaquatic environment 3abiodegradation 3abrackish water 3adissolved oxygen 3aendocrine-disrupting chemicals 3aestradiol 3aestrone 3aestuaries 3amicroorganisms 3aorganic matter 3aoxidants 3aChina1 aCheng, Qiao1 aTam, Nora FY1 aLin, Li1 aSu, Weiqi1 aLuan, Tiangang0 tEnvironmental Science & Technology.g2016 Apr. 19, v. 50, no. 8 p.4324-4334dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-58517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.est.5b061963Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02519naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245010800170300001600278520135400294592002801648650001601676650001701692650001801709650001101727650000901738650002001747650001601767653000801783653001301791653001301804653001201817653001501829700007001844700002401914773010001938856008602038852000902124655001202133IND60561155920221119180708.0190319e201705  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056115592DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodhyd.2016.11.0222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlghooneh, Ali10aRheological characterization of hydrocolloids interaction: A case study on sage seed gum-xanthan blends  ap. 206-215.  aIn this paper, a first robust scheme for in-depth rheological study on the interaction of two attractive hydrocolloids (sage seed gum (SSG) and xanthan gum (XG) at five blending levels (1-0, 3-1, 1-1, 1-3, and 0-1)) was defined by utilizing flow behavior, thixotropy and viscoelasticity measurements. Shear thinning as the important rheological behavior of biopolymers were found to be broadly different in steady and dynamic shear tests. We attributed this difference to the longer timescale of segment-segment interaction in SSG chains than that of XG. A well-developed three-parametric exponential model satisfactory fitted the recovery phase data of in-shear structural recovery test. There was a negative correlation between time effects in SAOS (small amplitude oscillatory shear) and thixotropy with R2 equal to −0.90. The highest recovery parameter (83.25%) and the lowest extent of time dependency (determined in SAOS) were obtained for XG. Excellent correlation existed between the extent of time dependency and the difference between static and dynamic yield stresses (R2 = 94–96%). The highest and lowest departure values from Cox-Merz rule were found for SSG (83.87%) and XG (46.18%), respectively. The strongest interaction between SSG and XG among all ratios tested, occurred for 3-1, which was confirmed by the Cole-Cole plot.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiopolymers 3acase studies 3ahydrocolloids 3amixing 3asage 3aviscoelasticity 3axanthan gum 0aGum 0aRecovery 0aRheology 0aSynergy 0aThixotropy1 aRazavi, Seyed Mohammad Ali1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2450-66231 aBehrouzian, Fataneh0 tFood hydrocolloids.g2017 May, v. 66 p.206-215dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46643x0268-005X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodhyd.2016.11.0223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02055naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131100001600149245010700165300001800272520090700290592002801197650002201225650001201247650001101259650002101270650001001291650001101301650001501312650001101327650001701338650001801355650001001373650001201383650000801395700001401403700001601417700001401433773010401447856008501551852000901636655001201645IND4459100720221119144103.0141111e201107  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445910072DNAL7 a10.1016/j.indcrop.2011.03.0262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDong, Juane10aEffects of microwave drying on the contents of functional constituents of Eucommia ulmoides flower tea  ap. 1102-1110.  aIn order to make male flower tea of Eucommia ulmoides, this paper systematically investigated the effects of microwave drying, a newly emerging drying method, on the contents of functional constituents contained in the flower (such as total flavonoids, chlorogenic acid, aucubin and geniposidic acid) from the aspects of microwave output power and time of treatment.

Spain with implications for interpreting speleothem δ18O  ap. 216-224.  aAn understanding of how seasonal and longer-term δ18O signals in meteoric precipitation (δ18Op) are modified by percolation through soils is essential to link temporal changes in speleothem δ18O to surface climatic conditions. This study focuses on modifications that occur in a relatively thick soil above a temperate cave site (La Garma, N. Spain). Monthly soil–water δ18O (δ18Osw) values at a depth of 60cm through the year are only 14% of the range in δ18Op, implying substantial homogenisation and attenuation of seasonal signals. A striking feature is that δ18Osw values at 60cm depth are lowest in summer and highest in winter, the opposite (anti-phase) to that observed in rainfall. Soil–water residence times of up to circa 6months in the upper 60cm of soil, and a matrix flow, piston-type infiltration behaviour with mixing are inferred. Evaporative effects on recovered soil–water δ18O are minimal at this wet temperate site, in contrast with published results from arid and semi-arid sites. A soil–water model is presented to estimate monthly δ18Osw as a function of air temperature and δ18Op, incorporating effects such as variations in the amount of infiltrated water, changes in the ratio between evaporation and transpiration, mixing with antecedent soil moisture and small enrichments in 18O linked to evaporation and summer moisture deficits. Our model reproduces the observed δ18Osw results, and produces δ18O outputs in excellent agreement with δ18O data for two monitored drip-water sites at La Garma cave that exhibit seasonal δ18O variability. We conclude that simple evapotranspiration models that permit infiltration during months that have a positive hydrological balance only, tend to underestimate summer rainfall contributions. Overall, the study provides an improved framework for predicting δ18Osw trends at temperate sites such as La Garma that have a relatively thick soil cover, as well as for understanding seasonal ranges and trends in δ18O in cave drip-sites.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair temperature 3aclimatic factors 3aevaporation 3aevapotranspiration 3ahomogenization 3amixing 3amodels 3aprediction 3arain 3asoil water 3asummer 3atemporal variation 3atranspiration 3awinter 3aSpain 0aSoil–water δ18O 0aLa Garma cave 0aStable oxygen isotopes 0aModelling1 aMcDermott, Frank0 tJournal of hydrology.g2015 Nov., v. 530 p.216-224dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl46539x0022-16947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2015.09.0533Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02883naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002600143245017000169300001600339520166000355592002802015650000802043650002602051650002202077650001502099650005802114650003702172650002502209650002802234651001102262700002302273700001802296773013302314856007702447852000902524655001202533IND60515676820221118163827.0160506e20160501xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051567682DNAL7 a10.1089/fpd.2015.20662doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRumore, Jillian Leigh14aThe Impact of Multilocus Variable-Number Tandem-Repeat Analysis on PulseNet Canada Escherichia coli O157:H7 Laboratory Surveillance and Outbreak Support, 2008–2012  ap. 255-261.  aThe lack of pattern diversity among pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) profiles for Escherichia coli O157:H7 in Canada does not consistently provide optimal discrimination, and therefore, differentiating temporally and/or geographically associated sporadic cases from potential outbreak cases can at times impede investigations. To address this limitation, DNA sequence-based methods such as multilocus variable-number tandem-repeat analysis (MLVA) have been explored. To assess the performance of MLVA as a supplemental method to PFGE from the Canadian perspective, a retrospective analysis of all E. coli O157:H7 isolated in Canada from January 2008 to December 2012 (inclusive) was conducted. A total of 2285 E. coli O157:H7 isolates and 63 clusters of cases (by PFGE) were selected for the study. Based on the qualitative analysis, the addition of MLVA improved the categorization of cases for 60% of clusters and no change was observed for ∼40% of clusters investigated. In such situations, MLVA serves to confirm PFGE results, but may not add further information per se. The findings of this study demonstrate that MLVA data, when used in combination with PFGE-based analyses, provide additional resolution to the detection of clusters lacking PFGE diversity as well as demonstrate good epidemiological concordance. In addition, MLVA is able to identify cluster-associated isolates with variant PFGE pattern combinations that may have been previously missed by PFGE alone. Optimal laboratory surveillance in Canada is achieved with the application of PFGE and MLVA in tandem for routine surveillance, cluster detection, and outbreak response.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aEscherichia coli O157 3adisease incidence 3amonitoring 3amultiple-locus variable number tandem-repeat analysis 3apulsed-field gel electrophoresis 3aqualitative analysis 3atandem repeat sequences 3aCanada1 aTschetter, Lorelee1 aNadon, Celine0 tFoodborne pathogens & disease.g2016 May 01, v. 13, no. 5 p.255-261dMary Ann Liebert, Inc.wJournal:jnl3973649x1556-71257nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1089/fpd.2015.20663Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03610naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002200151245006600173300001500239520229000254592002802544650003002572650001702602650001602619650001502635650001502650650001502665650001002680650001702690650001502707650002602722650001502748651001202763653002002775653002002795653001602815653002602831653002702857653003002884700001902914700002002933773010402953856008603057852000903143655001203152IND60539817520221118060817.0190318e201511  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053981752DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhydrol.2015.09.0542doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRomnée, Ambroise10aMethodology for a stormwater sensitive urban watershed design  ap. 87-102.  aIn urban stormwater management, decentralized systems are nowadays worldwide experimented, including stormwater best management practices. However, a watershed-scale approach, relevant for urban hydrology, is almost always neglected when designing a stormwater management plan with best management practices. As a consequence, urban designers fail to convince public authorities of the actual hydrologic effectiveness of such an approach to urban watershed stormwater management. In this paper, we develop a design oriented methodology for studying the morphology of an urban watershed in terms of sustainable stormwater management. The methodology is a five-step method, firstly based on the cartographic analysis of many stormwater relevant indicators regarding the landscape, the urban fabric and the governance. The second step focuses on the identification of many territorial stakes and their corresponding strategies of a decentralized stormwater management. Based on the indicators, the stakes and the strategies, the third step defines many spatial typologies regarding the roadway system and the urban fabric system. The fourth step determines many stormwater management scenarios to be applied to both spatial typologies systems. The fifth step is the design of decentralized stormwater management projects integrating BMPs into each spatial typology. The methodology aims to advise urban designers and engineering offices in the right location and selection of BMPs without given them a hypothetical unique solution. Since every location and every watershed is different due to local guidelines and stakeholders, this paper provide a methodology for a stormwater sensitive urban watershed design that could be reproduced everywhere. As an example, the methodology is applied as a case study to an urban watershed in Belgium, confirming that the method is applicable to any urban watershed. This paper should be helpful for engineering and design offices in urban hydrology to define a sustainable and decentralized stormwater management plan and redaction of performance standards at the watershed scale. The method applied in this paper toggles the decentralized stormwater approach from a common experimental point of view to an oriented problem–solution point of view.  aPublisher supplied data 3abest management practices 3acase studies 3aengineering 3agovernance 3aguidelines 3alandscapes 3aroads 3astakeholders 3astormwater 3astormwater management 3awatersheds 3aBelgium 0aUrban watershed 0aUrban hydrology 0aMethodology 0aStormwater management 0aDecentralized approach 0aBest management practices1 aEvrard, Arnaud1 aTrachte, Sophie0 tJournal of hydrology.g2015 Nov., v. 530 p.87-102dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl46539x0022-16947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2015.09.0543Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02580naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245007400164500001400238520121800252592002801470650002201498650001901520650003801539650000901577650002001586650001301606650001201619650001101631650002001642650001501662650000901677650001801686650001601704650002401720653002801744653002101772653002501793653001801818700001701836700001901853700001801872700001701890773010001907856008202007852000902089655001202098IND60722040220221121181614.0210226e202103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072204022DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tca.2020.1788522doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXia, Ze Yuan10aThermal decomposition kinetics of three anthraquinone hazardous waste  aNAL-light  aAnthraquinone nitro compounds are the important intermediate and hazardous waste in dye production. In order to understand the thermal decomposition characteristics of three typical dye wastes: 1-nitroanthraquinone, 1,5-dinitroanthraquinone and 1,8-dinitroanthraquinone, the dynamic and isothermal experiments were conducted by differential scanning calorimeter. The dynamic results indicate that these substances are decomposed after melting except for 1,5-dinitroanthraquinone and the specific heat release of these substances is higher than 800 J/g. Calculated by Friedman kinetic analysis, the activation energy of first step decomposition of 1,8-dinitroanthraquinone is consistent with 1-nitroanthraquinone, and the second step decomposition is consistent with the third step of 1,5-dinitroanthraquinone. Refer to the two kinetic models of 1-nitroanthraquinone ("autocatalytic") and 1,5-dinitroanthraquinone ("n-order + autocatalytic + autocatalytic"), the model of "autocatalytic + autocatalytic" were established for 1,8-dinitroanthraquinone. The prediction of the self-accelerating decomposition temperature indicates that coupling of phase transition and decomposition does not increase the thermal risk.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactivation energy 3aanthraquinones 3adifferential scanning calorimetry 3adyes 3ahazardous waste 3akinetics 3amelting 3amodels 3anitro compounds 3aprediction 3arisk 3aspecific heat 3atemperature 3athermal degradation 0aAnthraquinone dye waste 0aKinetic analysis 0aModel fitting method 0aDeconvolution1 aWu, Wen Qian1 aChen, Wang Hua1 aChen, Li Ping1 aGuo, Zi Chao0 tThermochimica acta.g2021 Mar., v. 697 p.178852-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11747x0040-60317nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tca.2020.1788523Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01879naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100006500147245009500212500001400307520073600321592002801057650001301085650001401098650001401112650001501126650002401141650001601165653002401181653003701205653004501242653002601287653002501313773010001338856008201438852000901520655001201529IND60722040420221120082151.0210226e202103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072204042DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tca.2020.1788552doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSbirrazzuoli, Nicolas1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6031-544810aModel-free isothermal and nonisothermal predictions using advanced isoconversional methods  aNAL-light  aFour complex mechanisms of two parallel independent reactions were simulated under various isothermal and nonisothermal conditions.

The Penman–Monteith equation of evaporation is often combined with sap flow measurements to describe canopy transpiration and stomatal conductance. The traditional approach involves a two-step calculation. In the first step, stomatal conductance is computed using an inverted form of Penman–Monteith equation. The second step correlates these values with environmental factors. In this work, we present an improved approach for direct parameterization of the Penman–Monteith equation developed to compute diurnal courses of stand canopy conductance (g c) from sap flow. The main advantages of this proposed approach versus using the classical approach are: (1) the calculation process is faster and involves fewer steps, (2) parameterization provides realistic values of canopy conductance, including conditions of low atmospheric vapor pressure deficit (D), whereas the traditional approach tends to yield unrealistic values for low D and (3) the new calculation method does not require enveloping curves to describe dependence of g c on D and thus avoids subjective data selection but it still allows to visualize separable responses of g c to environmental drivers (i.e., global radiation and vapor pressure deficit). The proposed approach was tested to calculate g c and to model the sap flow of a high mountain Pinus canariensis forest. The new calculation method permitted us to describe the stand canopy conductance and stand sap flow in sub-hour resolution for both day and night conditions. Direct parameterization of the Penman–Monteith approach as implemented in this study proved sufficiently sensitive for detecting diurnal variation in g c and for predicting sap flow from environmental variables under various atmospheric evapotranspirative demands and differing levels of soil water availability.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPinus canariensis 3acanopy 3adiurnal variation 3aenvironmental factors 3aequations 3aevaporation 3aforests 3amodels 3aplant available water 3aprediction 3asap flow 3astomatal conductance 3avapor pressure1 aBrito, Patrícia,1 aJiménez, María Soledad1 aUrban, Josef0 tTrees.g2017 June, v. 31, no. 3 p.873-885dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx0931-18907nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00468-016-1513-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02451naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001300144245013600157300001800293520112300311592002801434650001101462650002201473650000901495650002401504650001301528650001901541650001701560650003001577653002501607653003001632653002301662653001901685653002301704700002701727700001701754700002601771700001901797773012601816856007801942852000902020655001202029IND60528273820221118005007.0160716e20150506xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052827382DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.5b007152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHa, Enna10aMorphology-Controlled Synthesis of Au/Cu2FeSnS4 Core–Shell Nanostructures for Plasmon-Enhanced Photocatalytic Hydrogen Generation  ap. 9072-9077.  aCopper-based chalcogenides of earth-abundant elements have recently arisen as an alternate material for solar energy conversion. Cu₂FeSnS₄ (CITS), a quaternary chalcogenide that has received relatively little attention, has the potential to be developed into a low-cost and environmentlly friendly material for photovoltaics and photocatalysis. Herein, we report, for the first time, the synthesis, characterization, and growth mechanism of novel Au/CITS core–shell nanostructures with controllable morphology. Precise manipulations in the core–shell dimensions are demonstrated to yield two distinct heterostructures with spherical and multipod gold nanoparticle (NP) cores (Auₛₚ/CITS and Auₘₚ/CITS). In photocatalytic hydrogen generation with as-synthesized Au/CITS NPs, the presence of Au cores inside the CITS shell resulted in higher hydrogen generation rates, which can be attributed to the surface plasmon resonance (SPR) effect. The Auₛₚ/CITS and Auₘₚ/CITS core–shell NPs enhanced the photocatalytic hydrogen generation by about 125% and 240%, respectively, compared to bare CITS NPs.  aPublisher supplied data 3acopper 3aenergy conversion 3agold 3ahydrogen production 3ananogold 3aphotocatalysis 3asolar energy 3asurface plasmon resonance 0aAu/CITS core−shell 0asurface plasmon resonance 0ahydrogen evolution 0aphotocatalysis 0aanisotropic growth1 aLee, Lawrence Yoon Suk1 aMan, Ho-Wing1 aTsang, Shik Chi Edman1 aWong, Kwok-Yin0 tACS applied materials .g2015 May 06, v. 7, no. 17 p.9072-9077dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.5b007153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03257naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002500092040001800117100002900135245007400164300001600238520192600254592002802180650000802208650000902216650001602225650001002241650001202251650002102263650002302284650001202307650002002319650001302339650002402352650001302376650001702389650001202406650001702418650001102435650002302446650001002469650001702479650001602496650001402512653003102526653003002557700002102587773009602608856003802704852000902742655001202751IND4478047320221122235028.0120313s2012    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447804732DNAL7 a10.1071/AN110602doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVan Eenennaam, Alison L.10aWhere in the beef-cattle supply chain might DNA tests generate value?  ap. 185-196.  aDNA information has the potential to generate value for each sector of the beef-cattle industry. The value distribution among sectors (breeding, commercial, feedlot, processing) will differ depending on marketing. The more descendants an animal produces, the more valuable each unit of genetic improvement becomes. Therefore, the value of using DNA testing to increase the accuracy of selection and accelerate the rate of genetic gain is highest in the breeding sector, particularly for replacement stud animals. There is a lesser value associated with increasing the accuracy of yearling commercial bulls. The cost to DNA test commercial sires will likely be incurred by breeders before sale, and must be recouped through higher bull sale prices or increased market share. Commercial farmers could also use DNA tests to improve the accuracy of replacement female selection. This assumes the development of DNA tests that perform well for the low-heritability traits that directly affect maternal performance (e.g. days to calving) in commercial cattle populations. DNA tests may provide the sole source of information for traits that are not routinely measured on commercial farms. In that case, DNA test information will provide new selection criteria to allow for genetic improvement in those traits. As DNA test offerings mature to have improved accuracy for traits of great value to the feedlot (e.g. feed conversion, disease resistance) and processing (e.g. meat quality) sectors, the added value derived from DNA-enabled selection for these traits will need to be efficiently transferred up the beef production chain to incentivise continued investment. The widespread adoption of DNA testing to enhance the accuracy of selection will likely require an approach to share the value realised by downstream sectors of the beef-cattle industry with those upstream sectors incurring DNA collection and testing expenses.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3abeef 3abeef cattle 3abulls 3acalving 3acommercial farms 3adisease resistance 3afarmers 3afeed conversion 3afeedlots 3agenetic improvement 3aindustry 3amarket share 3amarkets 3ameat quality 3aprices 3aselection criteria 3asires 3asupply chain 3avalue added 3ayearlings 0amarker-assisted management 0amarker-assisted selection1 aDrake, Daniel J.0 tAnimal production science.g2012, v. 52, no. 3 p.185-196dCSIRO Publishingx1836-09397nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1071/AN11060  aDNAL 7aarticle03187naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001300151245012500164300001600289520189500305592002802200650001302228650001502241650002102256650002202277650001502299650001102314650002402325650001202349650002502361650001602386653002602402653004202428653001702470653002602487700001602513700001602529700002002545773010502565856008602670852000902756655001202765IND60539818420221118060844.0190318e201512  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053981842DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhydrol.2015.09.0642doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPool, M.12aA comparison of deterministic and stochastic approaches for regional scale inverse modeling on the Mar del Plata aquifer  ap. 214-229.  aInversion of the spatial variability of transmissivity (T) in groundwater models can be handled using either stochastic or deterministic (i.e., geology-based zonation) approaches. While stochastic methods predominate in scientific literature, they have never been formally compared to deterministic approaches, preferred by practitioners, for regional aquifer models. We use both approaches to model groundwater flow and solute transport in the Mar del Plata aquifer, where seawater intrusion is a major threat to freshwater resources. The relative performance of the two approaches is evaluated in terms of (i) model fits to head and concentration data (available for nearly a century), (ii) geological plausibility of the estimated T fields, and (iii) their ability to predict transport. We also address the impact of conditioning the estimated fields on T data coming from either pumping tests interpreted with the Theis method or specific capacity values from step-drawdown tests. We find that stochastic models, based upon conditional estimation and simulation techniques, identify some of the geological features (river deposit channels and low transmissivity regions associated to quartzite outcrops) and yield better fits to calibration data than the much simpler geology-based deterministic model, which cannot properly address model structure uncertainty. However, the latter demonstrates much greater robustness for predicting sea water intrusion and for incorporating concentrations as calibration data. We attribute the poor performance, and underestimated uncertainty, of the stochastic simulations to estimation bias introduced by model errors. Qualitative geological information is extremely rich in identifying large-scale variability patterns, which are identified by stochastic models only in data rich areas, and should be explicitly included in the calibration process.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaquifers 3afreshwater 3agroundwater flow 3ahydrologic models 3aprediction 3arivers 3asaltwater intrusion 3asolutes 3astochastic processes 3auncertainty 0aReal regional aquifer 0aDeterministic–stochastic approaches 0aPilot points 0aPlausible calibration1 aCarrera, J.1 aAlcolea, A.1 aBocanegra, E.M.0 tJournal of hydrology.g2015 Dec., v. 531 p.214-229dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl46539x0022-16947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2015.09.0643Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02850naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002600151245007100177300001400248520176400262592002802026650001302054650002702067650002402094650001002118653003702128653003702165653001802202653002102220700002402241700001602265700002102281773010302302856008602405852000902491655001202500IND60539818620221118060727.0190318e201512  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053981862DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhydrol.2015.09.0662doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFernàndez-Garcia, D.12aA locally adaptive kernel regression method for facies delineation  ap. 62-72.  aFacies delineation is defined as the separation of geological units with distinct intrinsic characteristics (grain size, hydraulic conductivity, mineralogical composition). A major challenge in this area stems from the fact that only a few scattered pieces of hydrogeological information are available to delineate geological facies. Several methods to delineate facies are available in the literature, ranging from those based only on existing hard data, to those including secondary data or external knowledge about sedimentological patterns. This paper describes a methodology to use kernel regression methods as an effective tool for facies delineation. The method uses both the spatial and the actual sampled values to produce, for each individual hard data point, a locally adaptive steering kernel function, self-adjusting the principal directions of the local anisotropic kernels to the direction of highest local spatial correlation. The method is shown to outperform the nearest neighbor classification method in a number of synthetic aquifers whenever the available number of hard data is small and randomly distributed in space. In the case of exhaustive sampling, the steering kernel regression method converges to the true solution. Simulations ran in a suite of synthetic examples are used to explore the selection of kernel parameters in typical field settings. It is shown that, in practice, a rule of thumb can be used to obtain suboptimal results. The performance of the method is demonstrated to significantly improve when external information regarding facies proportions is incorporated. Remarkably, the method allows for a reasonable reconstruction of the facies connectivity patterns, shown in terms of breakthrough curves performance.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaquifers 3ahydraulic conductivity 3aregression analysis 3aseeds 0aStochastic groundwater hydrology 0aGeological facies reconstruction 0aGeostatistics 0aSolute transport1 aBarahona-Palomo, M.1 aHenri, C.V.1 aSanchez-Vila, X.0 tJournal of hydrology.g2015 Dec., v. 531 p.62-72dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl46539x0022-16947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2015.09.0663Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03726naa a2200673 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002700144245005600171300001600227500000900243520187700252592002802129650001202157650001602169650002102185650001902206650003302225650001202258650001202270650001902282650002902301650002302330650001302353650003002366650002902396650001602425650001602441650001002457650001502467650001002482650001102492650001502503650001302518650002002531650001302551650001802564650001202582650001502594650002102609650002002630650002402650650001702674650001302691650001002704650001902714651002502733651001002758700001602768700001602784700001602800773013602816856007902952852000903031655001203040IND60668330920221120110503.0191228e200205  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066833092DNAL7 a10.2136/sssaj2002.94802doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSánchez-Marañón, M.10aSoil Quality in Mediterranean Mountain Environments  ap. 948-958.  aepub  aUnsuitable land use worldwide has led to environmental degradation. Land use effects on the environmental component of soil quality were assessed in 47 benchmark soils of three natural environments (Xerolls, Xerepts, and Cryepts) in southern Spain. Within each environment, soil groups with traditional land uses were compared with native sites. Soil quality changes were inferred by measuring the relative changes in chemical and physical soil properties. Irrigated terraces, rainfed cropland, and grassland, all within Xerepts, and grazed thyme scrub land were degraded with respect to native sites (significant differences at P < 0.05). In all cases, total porosity, macroporosity, and cation exchange capacity declined by more than 18% (−0.11 cm³ cm⁻³), 30% (−0.11 cm³ cm⁻³), and 48% [−10.5 cmol(+) kg⁻¹], respectively. Except in irrigated terraces, soil erodibility increased by as much as 59% (+0.16 USLE factor). Substantial losses of soil organic C (37%, −14.7 Mg ha⁻¹), available water (52%, −36.2 mm), total N (65%, −1.7 Mg ha⁻¹), and rooting depth (68%, −39 cm) were also observed in grassland and thyme scrub land. These changes suggest adverse effects on environmental protection functions of soil because of soil compaction and/or elimination of structural binding agents. Scanning electron microscopy images confirmed these morphological changes in microaggregates. Similar changes did not occur in cropland and grassland within Cryepts or in planted pine forest land. Reforestation with pine (Pinus nigra Arnold, Pinus sylvestris L., and Pinus uncinata Mill. ex Mirb.) provided organic cements and fungal hyphae that reinforce soil aggregation as well as ecologically valuable humus. Because cropland and grassland were able to recover the natural soil properties without human activity, we deduce that Cryepts are resilient.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCryepts 3aPinus nigra 3aPinus sylvestris 3aPinus uncinata 3aUniversal Soil Loss Equation 3aXerepts 3aXerolls 3abinding agents 3acation exchange capacity 3aconiferous forests 3acropland 3aenvironmental degradation 3aenvironmental protection 3aerodibility 3aforest land 3afungi 3agrasslands 3ahumus 3ahyphae 3airrigation 3aland use 3amicroaggregates 3aporosity 3areforestation 3arooting 3ashrublands 3asoil aggregation 3asoil compaction 3asoil organic carbon 3asoil quality 3aterraces 3athyme 3atotal nitrogen 3aMediterranean region 3aSpain1 aSoriano, M.1 aDelgado, G.1 aDelgado, R.0 tSoil Science Society of America journal.g2002 May, v. 66, no. 3 p.948-958dSoil Science SocietywJournal:jnl44580x0361-59957nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2136/sssaj2002.94803Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02557naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100003000147245012300177300001600300520155700316592002801873650002101901650002201922650001801944650001301962650001301975650001301988650001002001650001902011700002002030773009102050856008102141852000902222655001202231IND60575305220221121044308.0170728e201706  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057530522DNAL7 a10.1007/s00468-017-1520-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHoltmeier, Friedrich-Karl10aLayering in the Rocky Mountain treeline ecotone: clonal conifer groups’ distribution, structure, and functional role  ap. 953-965.  aKEY MESSAGE: Layering plays a major role in treeline stability. Growth ring pattern of clonal groups reflects both an individualistic and an only temporally common response to the harsh treeline environment. Clonal groups are common to alpine and polar treelines. Distribution, shape, architecture, and development of clonal Picea engelmannii and Abies lasiocarpa in an extremely windy Rocky Mountain treeline ecotone are considered. Clonal groups prevail (>70% of all tree groups). Most of them consist of A. lasiocarpa (65%). Number, growth form, and damage were documented along transects and field routes. Age structure and development of the clonal groups were assessed using increment cores and stem disks. The groups usually consisted of different clonal series with several clonal members in each. On wind-swept terrain, clonal groups exhibit wedge-like, hedge-like, or mat-like habit. One clonal A. lasiocarpa group was studied in detail and it serves as an example showing formation, architecture, and internal growth pattern of clonal series. The clone members in the clone series exhibited an individualistic growth pattern. Wind-control of growth occasionally overruled the often ‘chaotic’ internal group growth pattern. The effect of prevailing winds, however, temporally overlapped with a ‘force’ directed from the center of the group margin (e.g., competition for light, high stem density), as reflected in recurrent change of eccentricity within the clonal trunks. Clonal groups may be of major importance in treeline dynamics.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAbies lasiocarpa 3aPicea engelmannii 3aage structure 3aconifers 3aecotones 3atreeline 3atrees 3awind direction1 aBroll, Gabriele0 tTrees.g2017 June, v. 31, no. 3 p.953-965dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx0931-18907nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00468-017-1520-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02763naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001300144245011500157300001800272520143800290592002801728650001401756650002201770650002001792650000901812650002301821650002201844653003401866653002101900653001801921653002301939653001901962700001901981700001502000700001202015700001402027700001702041700001802058700001202076700001702088773012302105856008002228852000902308655001202317IND60528274320221118005233.0160716e20150506xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052827432DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.5b008952doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGao, Hao10aNucleation and Crystal Growth of Organic–Inorganic Lead Halide Perovskites under Different Relative Humidity  ap. 9110-9117.  aOrganic–inorganic lead halide perovskite compounds are very promising materials for high-efficiency perovskite solar cells. But how to fabricate high-quality perovksite films under controlled humidity conditions is still an important issue due to their sensitivity to moisture. In this study, we investigated the influence of ambient humidity on crystallization and surface morphology of one-step spin-coated perovskite films, as well as the performance of solar cells based on these perovskite films. On the basis of experimental analyses and thin film growth theory, we conclude that the influence of ambient humidity on nucleation at spin-coating stage is quite different from that on crystal growth at annealing stage. At the spin-coating stage, high nucleation density induced by high supersaturation prefers to appear under anhydrous circumstances, resulting in layer growth and high coverage of perovskite films. But at the annealing stage, the modest supersaturation benefits formation of perovskite films with good crystallinity. The films spin-coated under low relative humidity (RH) followed by annealing under high RH show an increase of crystallinity and improved performance of devices. Therefore, a mechanism of fast nucleation followed by modest crystal growth (high supersaturation at spin-coating stage and modest supersaturation at annealing stage) is suggested in the formation of high-quality perovskite films.  aPublisher supplied data 3aannealing 3acrystal structure 3acrystallization 3alead 3aphotovoltaic cells 3arelative humidity 0amethylammonium lead trihalide 0aambient humidity 0afilm coverage 0anucleation density 0acrystal growth1 aBao, Chunxiong1 aLi, Faming1 aYu, Tao1 aYang, Jie1 aZhu, Weidong1 aZhou, Xiaoxin1 aFu, Gao1 aZou, Zhigang0 tACS Applied Materials & Interfaces.g2015 May 06, v. 7, no. 17 p.9110-9117dAmerican Chemical Societyx1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facsami.5b008953Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03101naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100006200149245011200211300001500323520106100338592002801399650002701427650002401454650001801478650001601496650001801512650002101530650002101551650002701572650001101599650002001610650001601630650001901646650002801665650001801693650001301711650001601724650004401740650002401784650001301808650002001821650001301841653001501854653002101869653001401890653001301904653002601917653001701943700006001960700006302020700006202083700001902145700002302164700001502187700005702202773008802259856008402347990002302431852000902454655001202463IND60722041320221120060628.0220207e202102  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072204132DNAL7 a10.1016/j.virol.2020.12.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIshigaki, Hirohito1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5249-859810aNeutralizing antibody-dependent and -independent immune responses against SARS-CoV-2 in cynomolgus macaques  ap. 97-105.  aWe examined the pathogenicity of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) in cynomolgus macaques for 28 days to establish an animal model of COVID-19 for the development of vaccines and antiviral drugs. Cynomolgus macaques infected with SARS-CoV-2 showed body temperature rises and X-ray radiographic pneumonia without life-threatening clinical signs of disease. A neutralizing antibody against SARS-CoV-2 and T-lymphocytes producing interferon (IFN)-γ specifically for SARS-CoV-2 N-protein were detected on day 14 in one of three macaques with viral pneumonia. In the other two macaques, in which a neutralizing antibody was not detected, T-lymphocytes producing IFN-γ specifically for SARS-CoV-2 N protein increased on day 7 to day 14, suggesting that not only a neutralizing antibody but also cellular immunity has a role in the elimination of SARS-CoV-2. Thus, because of similar symptoms to approximately 80% of patients, cynomolgus macaques are appropriate to extrapolate the efficacy of vaccines and antiviral drugs for humans.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCoronavirus infections 3aMacaca fascicularis 3aT-lymphocytes 3aX-radiation 3aanimal models 3aantiviral agents 3abody temperature 3acell-mediated immunity 3ahumans 3aimmune response 3ainterferons 3aneutralization 3aneutralizing antibodies 3apathogenicity 3apatients 3aradiography 3asigns and symptoms (animals and humans) 3avaccine development 3avaccines 3aviral pneumonia 3avirology 0aSARS-CoV-2 0aNonhuman primate 0aPneumonia 0aThrombus 0aNeutralizing antibody 0aTh1 response1 aNakayama, Misako1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8611-06621 aKitagawa, Yoshinori1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3275-33361 aNguyen, Cong Thanh1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5973-62101 aHayashi, Kaori1 aShiohara, Masanori1 aGotoh, Bin1 aItoh, Yasushi1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7462-21930 tVirology.g2021 Feb., v. 554 p.97-105dElsevier Inc.wJournal:2802x0042-68227nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.virol.2020.12.0133Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03775naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245011500164300001800279500001500297520208000312592002802392650001602420650001902436650001402455650002702469650003902496650002002535650002102555650004402576650001102620650002502631650001502656650002302671650001102694650001302705650003402718650003502752650004302787650001002830650002102840650000902861650002002870650001302890650001302903653004002916653002102956700001802977700001402995700001703009773009303026856008103119852000903200655001203209IND60575305620221121055155.0170728e201706  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057530562DNAL7 a10.1007/s00468-017-1528-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Zihan10aCarbon competition between fatty acids and starch during benzoin seeds maturation slows oil accumulation speed  ap. 1025-1039.  a2019-12-06  aKEY MESSAGE: The carbon flow balance is shifted to starch rather than oil accumulation during benzoin seed development stage (80–120 DAF) and thereby lipid deposition speed slows down. Benzoin [Styrax tonkinensis (Pierre) Craib ex Hartwich] is a woody oilseed species with potential value as a biofuel feedstock. However, the continuous drop in seed crude fat concentration during maturation had remained unexplained until it was investigated in this study. Seed filling began 60 days after flowering (DAF), when the hexose-to-sucrose ratio dropped, correlating with substantial morphological changes in kernels. Oil accumulated 20 days earlier than starch, as the concentrations of free fatty acid (50–70 DAF) and diacylglycerols (50–80 DAF) increased rapidly. Fatty acid synthesis slowed between 80 and 120 days, correlating with a sharp increase in the speed of starch deposition, while triacylglycerol accumulation and the profile of fatty acids remained stable. Phosphoglucose isomerase (PGI), pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDHC), and malate dehydrogenase (MDH) activities dropped progressively together with acetyl coenzyme carboxylase (ACCase) after 70 DAF before the reserve storage priority shifted from fatty acids to starch. PGI, PDHC, MDH, ACCase, and diglyceride acyltransferase (DAGT) activities rose again at 120 DAF, after which the speed of fatty acid accumulation increased, correlating with a 10-day lag phase in starch accumulation. High glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH) activity was observed during oil deposition. Soluble protein continued accumulating as protease activity decreased during benzoin seed development, while the total amylase activity rose twice between 30 and 70 DAF before the ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase activity and starch content soared high simultaneously after 70 DAF. The collective results suggest that carbon partitioning between starch and lipid accumulation occurs during benzoin kernel development and is responsible for a reduction in the rate at which total fatty acids accumulate between 80 and 120 DAF.  aPublisher supplied data 3afatty acids 3afilling period 3aflowering 3afatty acid composition 3apyruvate dehydrogenase (lipoamide) 3adiacylglycerols 3afree fatty acids 3aglucose-1-phosphate adenylyltransferase 3acarbon 3amalate dehydrogenase 3afeedstocks 3aStyrax tonkinensis 3astarch 3aoilseeds 3aglucose-6-phosphate isomerase 3adiacylglycerol acyltransferase 3aNADP-glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase 3aseeds 3atriacylglycerols 3aoils 3aenzyme activity 3abiofuels 3aamylases 0aglucose-6-phosphate 1-dehydrogenase 0aseed development1 aWang, Xiaojun1 aLuo, Ying1 aYu, Fangyuan0 tTrees.g2017 June, v. 31, no. 3 p.1025-1039dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx0931-18907nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00468-017-1528-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02818naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002400147245008500171300001800256520160900274592002801883650001901911650001801930650001901948650001601967650001901983650001702002650001702019650001302036650000902049650001902058650001102077650001902088650001902107650001602126650001202142700003602154700002302190773009302213856008102306852000902387655001202396IND60575305720221121055244.0170728e201706  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057530572DNAL7 a10.1007/s00468-016-1476-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMarias, Danielle E.10aLeaf age and methodology impact assessments of thermotolerance of Coffea arabica  ap. 1091-1099.  aKEY MESSAGE: Mature Coffea arabica leaves were more heat tolerant than expanding leaves, longer recovery time yielded more accurate thermotolerance assessments, and photochemistry was more heat sensitive than cell membranes. Given future climate predictions of increased heatwaves in the tropics, suitable habitat to grow ecologically, economically, and socially valuable Coffea arabica L. is threatened. Accurate assessments of high temperature tolerance or thermotolerance are critical for understanding C. arabica responses to increased temperature. Thermotolerance curves of C. arabica leaf discs were constructed by measuring chlorophyll fluorescence (ratio of variable to maximum fluorescence, F V/F M; minimum fluorescence, F O) across three leaf age classes and two recovery times (15 min, 24 h) after 15 min exposure to temperatures from 25 to 58 °C. Thermotolerance measured with electrolyte leakage after 20 min at 25–65 °C was compared with F V/F M thermotolerance curves. The temperature corresponding to 50 % damage (T ₅₀) was 49.0 and 58.6 °C for the chlorophyll fluorescence and electrolyte leakage methods, respectively. The critical temperature at which the F O rise began on F O-temperature curves (T cᵣᵢₜ) was 46.0 °C. We found that the 24 h recovery time yielded more accurate estimates of T ₅₀, and that thermotolerance based on T cᵣᵢₜ increased with leaf age. Differences between the fluorescence and electrolyte leakage methods showed that photosystem II processes were more sensitive to temperatures above 40 °C than cell membrane stability.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCoffea arabica 3aage structure 3acell membranes 3achlorophyll 3aclimate models 3aelectrolytes 3afluorescence 3ahabitats 3aheat 3aheat tolerance 3aleaves 3aphotochemistry 3aphotosystem II 3atemperature 3atropics1 aMeinzer, F.

A two-element sidescan installation looking transverse to the river flow detected echo traces due to salmon at ranges up to 250 m in water 6-13 m deep. The salmon target trajectories were identified and counted against a background of acoustic reverberation from the river surface and bottom sediments. Occasional, strong interference from boat wakes and wind-induced surface waves and bubbles was observed. Fish echo trajectory analyses allowed extraction of upstream and cross-stream swimming speeds. For some targets acoustic multipaths from surface and bottom reflections were distinguishable from direct echoes at ranges up to 150 m. Acoustic models of surface and bottom boundary backscattering, combined with bubble layer scattering and attenuation under breaking wave conditions, were able to match the observed background echo levels. Comparisons of model and data predict that under ideal conditions fish detection should be possible at ranges up to 250 m, but under windy conditions detection was limited to less than 70 m.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacoustics 3aboats 3abubbles 3afield experimentation 3amodels 3arivers 3asalmon 3asediments 3asurface waves 3aswimming 3aBritish Columbia0 tCanadian journal of fisheries and aquatic sciences.g1997 July 01, v. 54, no. 7 p.1619-1629dNRC Research Pressx1205-75337nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1139/f97-0693Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03442naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004900094040001800143100001800161245005700179300001600236500000900252520207300261592002802334650001302362650001602375650001702391650002102408650001102429650001802440650002202458650001502480650002502495650000902520650001302529650001102542650000902553650002102562650001402583650001802597650002302615650001702638651001402655700001902669700001902688773014802707856009602855852000902951655001202960IND60668331620221120100757.0191125e197703  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066833162DNAL7 a10.2136/sssaj1977.03615995004100020026x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKhalid, R. A.10aPhosphorus Sorption Characteristics of Flooded Soils  ap. 305-310.  aepub  aSurface soils representing Alfisols and Inceptisols were collected from various parts of Louisiana under rice (Oryza sativa L.) cultivation and incubated under oxidized (aerobic) and reduced (anaerobic) conditions for 2 weeks in a soil to 0.01M CaCl₂ solution ratio of 1:5. The release of native soil P and the sorption of added inorganic P was investigated under these conditions. The soils selected for study were characterized for clay content, total carbon, extractable P, pH, and oxalate-extractable Fe, soil properties associated with P sorption. The results show that generally more soil P was released under reduced than oxidized conditions, and this increase in soluble P under reduced conditions was significantly related to Bray no. 2 extractable P, clay content, and oxalate Fe. At high levels of added P, more P was sorbed under reduced conditions than under oxidized conditions in 14 out of 20 soils under study. However, in Midland fine sandy loam essentially all of added P was recovered in the equilibrium solution under both oxidized and reduced conditions, suggesting this soil had no capacity to sorb P. The relationship between P sorbed at 500 µg/g added P and oxalate-extractable Fe was described by fitting two linear curves with different slopes. In the reduced soil samples the slope of Region I (≤ 3,000 µg Fe/g) suggests that 5.4 Fe sorbed 1 P and that this ratio did not change until all of the added P was sorbed. In the oxidized samples this ratio was about 16 Fe/1 P for Region I (≤4,500 µg Fe/g). The slopes for Region II of the linear curves for both reduced and oxidized samples were essentially zero. A closer relationship between P sorbed and oxalate extractable Fe under reduced conditions indicates that poorly crystalline and amorphous oxides and hydroxides of Fe play a primary role in P retention by flooded soils and sediments. A probable greater surface area generated by the transformation of oxyferric hydroxide to more reactive ferrous compounds may be responsible for greater P sorption under reduced conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAlfisols 3aInceptisols 3aOryza sativa 3acalcium chloride 3acarbon 3aclay fraction 3aferrous compounds 3ahydroxides 3ainorganic phosphorus 3airon 3aoxalates 3aoxides 3arice 3asandy loam soils 3asediments 3asoil sampling 3asoluble phosphorus 3asurface area 3aLouisiana1 aPatrick, W.

This is in contrast to a critical period, a time at which a behaviour must be learned, and if this window of opportunity is missed, then the behaviour can never be acquired. Both might determine food acceptance in childhood. RECENT FINDINGS: There is evidence to support the idea of a sensitive period for the introduction of tastes, a critical period for the introduction of textures and for the development of oral motor function, and a possible critical period for the introduction of new foods but only in children where there is an innate disposition to develop early and extreme disgust responses. There are both sensitive and critical periods in the acquisition of food preferences.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3achildhood 3achildren 3afood acceptability 3afoods 3ainfancy 3alearning1 aMason, Sarah0 tCurrent nutrition reports.g2017 June, v. 6, no. 2 p.190-196dSpringer USx2161-33117nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13668-017-0203-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03160naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245007300166300001400239500001100253520197900264592002802243650001302271650002202284650001402306650001902320650001802339650001302357650001602370650003002386650001702416650002402433650001202457650001502469650001702484650001702501650001802518650001902536773009302555856008102648852000902729655001202738IND60575307720221120022502.0170728e201706  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057530772DNAL7 a10.1007/s13668-017-0206-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPoppitt, S. D.10aObesity and Weight Control: Is There Light at the End of the Tunnel?  ap. 51-62.  aReview  aPURPOSE OF REVIEW: Our global population recently arrived at the landmark figure of seven billion, and the nutrition problems we face are increasing as rapidly, with the longstanding crisis of undernutrition joined by the escalating problem of overconsumption and obesity. Over the past 30 years, it has become clear that control of body weight is as simple as matching energy intake to expenditure, yet how to achieve this in the current obesigenic environment is far from simple. A review of causative mechanisms shows controlling eating behaviour and food intake as central to regulation of body weight, but in an environment where the need to suppress intake is uppermost, there are few physiological mechanisms with which to tackle this. RECENT FINDINGS: Macronutrient composition, energy density, food format (beverages), palatability, portion size and hedonics all influence intake and readily promote overeating. Currently, the most successful obesity treatment is restrictive bariatric surgery, both invasive and expensive, achieving better outcomes than diet and exercise. Despite considerable advances, there remains a critical gap in translation of underpinning knowledge into successful public health outcomes, as recently outlined in the 2nd Lancet series in obesity with no country reporting decreased obesity prevalence in the last 30 years. Future contribution may come from better understanding of mechanisms including gut-brain axis and regulation of appetite, the gut microbiome and the genetic underpinning of bodyweight control. Clearly, prevention is the key, with nutrition education required to lead changes in behaviour, and possibly the only viable long-term approach. Whether the global obesity trend can be reversed without significant change in national food policies and/or the built environment however is under debate, and without doubt a major public health challenge for tomorrow if there is to be light at the end of the obesity tunnel.  aPublisher supplied data 3aappetite 3abariatric surgery 3abeverages 3aenergy density 3aenergy intake 3aexercise 3afood policy 3aintestinal microorganisms 3amalnutrition 3anutrition education 3aobesity 3aovereating 3apalatability 3aportion size 3apublic health 3aweight control0 tCurrent nutrition reports.g2017 June, v. 6, no. 2 p.51-62dSpringer USx2161-33117nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13668-017-0206-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02767naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245006300168300001600231500001100247500001500258520147200273592002801745650001901773650001601792650002201808650002001830650002401850650002501874650001601899650001701915650001101932650001201943650002001955650001701975650001901992650001402011650002302025650001302048650001202061653001802073700002102091773009502112856008102207852000902288655001202297IND60575308020221120025408.0170728e201706  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057530802DNAL7 a10.1007/s13668-017-0200-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDunn, Rebecca L.14aThe Influence of Human Milk on Flavor and Food Preferences  ap. 134-140.  aReview  a2019-12-06  aPURPOSE OF REVIEW: The purpose of this review is to provide an overview of the literature that examines sensory experiences during early feeding practices and the influence human milk has on flavor and food preferences. RECENT FINDINGS: Research suggests that the development of flavor and food preferences begins during the prenatal period through exposure to amniotic fluid and continues in the postnatal period during breastfeeding. Breastfeeding provides an infant with a unique variety of constantly changing chemosensory experiences as human milk contains flavors from foods that are part of the mother’s diet. These early flavor exposures are believed to help with the transition to complementary foods during later infancy and early childhood. Compared to formula-fed infants who are exposed to limited sensory experiences due to its constant flavor, breastfed infants demonstrate greater acceptance of novel foods when they are part of the maternal diet. Studies show that toddlers, preschool, and school-aged children who were breastfed as infants demonstrate more positive acceptance of a wider variety of healthy foods and are more accepting of new foods and are less likely to be picky eaters. Infant exposure early in life to a wide variety of flavors from healthy and nutrient-rich foods through amniotic fluid and human milk contributes to an individual’s unique set of taste preferences that can lead to healthier food choices and optimal health.  aPublisher supplied data 3abreast feeding 3anovel foods 3apostpartum period 3aschool children 3acomplementary foods 3aprenatal development 3abreast milk 3ahealthy diet 3aflavor 3ainfancy 3ainfant formulas 3afood choices 3aamniotic fluid 3achildhood 3amaternal nutrition 3atoddlers 3ainfants 0aeating habits1 aLessen, Rachelle0 tCurrent nutrition reports.g2017 June, v. 6, no. 2 p.134-140dSpringer USx2161-33117nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13668-017-0200-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03085naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100002000155245015300175520168400328592002802012650002002040650002402060650001602084650002502100650001602125650001002141650003402151650001402185650001802199650002002217650001402237650001302251650002702264653000902291653002002300653002302320653001602343700001702359700001802376700001502394700002002409773009902429856009002528852000902618655001202627IND60722043820221122074124.0211123e20210330xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072204382DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aquaculture.2020.7363092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Hongkuan10aGenome-wide analysis of TRAF gene family and its response to bacterial infection in noble scallop Chlamys nobilis with different carotenoids content  aTumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor-associated factors (TRAFs) are multifunctional adaptor proteins in the immune system, which play significant roles in the regulation of Toll-like receptor and RIG-I-like receptor signaling pathway in animals. Although many TRAF genes have been identified in mollusks, the systematic identification of the TRAF gene family in noble scallop Chlamys nobilis has not been reported, and very little is known about its roles in scallop innate immunity. In this study, four TRAF genes (CnTRAF 2, CnTRAF3, CnTRAF4 and CnTRAF6) were identified and characterized from C. nobilis. Sequence and phylogenetic analysis revealed that CnTRAFs contain typical conserved domains closely related to TRAFs of other mollusks. The motifs analysis of C. nobilis CnTRAFs also showed that the conserved motifs were identical to other mollusks and vertebrates. The expression pattern of CnTRAF genes in tissues of brown and golden scallops (the carotenoid content of golden scallops is significantly higher than that of brown scallops) were not statistically significant, but in hemolymph of scallops challenged with bacteria, the expression of CnTRAF genes was significantly higher than that of control, suggesting that the CnTRAF genes play vital roles in the immunity of mollusks. Furthermore, at several time points after bacteria challenge, the expression level of CnTRAF genes in golden scallops were significantly higher than that of brown scallops, indicating that carotenoids may enhance CnTRAF genes expression and immunity. The systematic analysis of the roles of TRAFs in C. nobilis provides valuable information for the further researches of CnTRAF genes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChlamys nobilis 3aToll-like receptors 3aaquaculture 3abacterial infections 3acarotenoids 3agenes 3agenome-wide association study 3ahemolymph 3aimmune system 3ainnate immunity 3aphylogeny 3ascallops 3atumor necrosis factors 0aTRAF 0aChlamys nobilis 0aBacteria challenge 0aCarotenoids1 aTan, Karsoon1 aLi, Shengkang1 aMa, Hongyu1 aZheng, Huaiping0 tAquaculture.g2021 Mar. 30, v. 535 p.736309-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl59663x0044-84867nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquaculture.2020.7363093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03078naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001600155245013100171500001400302520144100316592002801757650002501785650003001810650001101840650001601851650002201867650001001889650001401899650002301913650005101936650001701987650001702004650001102021650001802032650002402050650002902074650001202103653001302115653001602128653000902144700001602153700001402169700001402183700001302197700001502210700001902225700001702244700001902261700001602280700001802296773009902314856009002413852000902503655001202512IND60722043920221122062918.0210212e20210315xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072204392DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aquaculture.2020.7363242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Sheng10aMAPKKK15 gene from shrimp Litopenaeus vannamei is transcribed in larva development stages and contributes to WSSV pathogenesis  aNAL-light  aMAPKKK15 is a member of the mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase (MAPKKK) family, which plays an important role in multiple biological progresses triggered by cellular stresses. In this study, a new homolog of MAPKKK15 has been cloned and identified from shrimp Litopenaeus vannamei (named as LvMAPKKK15). The full length of LvMAPKKK15 transcript was 4597 bp, including a 4317 bp open reading frame (ORF) that encoded a putative protein of 1438 amino acids. LvMAPKKK15 was abundantly expressed at early development stages with the highest transcriptional level in P12 stage. In adult shrimp, tissue distribution showed that LvMAPKKK15 was highly expressed in eyestalk, nerve and hemocytes. Besides, the induced transcription of LvMAPKKK15 could respond to the challenges of Poly (I: C) and white spot syndrome virus (WSSV). RNAi-mediated knockdown of LvMAPKKK15 caused shrimp less sensitive to WSSV infection, manifested by lessened virus loads, higher survival rate and higher transcription levels of anti-viral factors LvVagos. The results were further supported by the dual-luciferase reporter assays that the LvMAPKKK15 was able to up-regulate the promoter activities of several WSSV immediate early (IE) genes, but suppress the promoter activities of LvVago1–5 in vitro of cells. Together, these results suggested that LvMAPKKK15 was transcribed in larva development stages and played a role during WSSV pathogenesis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLitopenaeus vannamei 3aWhite spot syndrome virus 3aadults 3aaquaculture 3aearly development 3agenes 3ahemocytes 3alarval development 3amitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase 3anerve tissue 3apathogenesis 3ashrimp 3asurvival rate 3atissue distribution 3atranscription (genetics) 3aviruses 0aMAPKKK15 0aLarva stage 0aWSSV1 aLi, Haoyang1 aZhu, Peng1 aFu, Qihui1 aYin, Bin1 aLi, Qinyao1 aChen, Rongjian1 aJiang, Xiewu1 aWeng, Shaoping1 aHe, Jianguo1 aLi, Chaozheng0 tAquaculture.g2021 Mar. 15, v. 534 p.736324-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl59663x0044-84867nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquaculture.2020.7363243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01666naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245014800168300001600316520043100332592002800763650002700791650001900818650002100837650002000858650001400878650001600892650002300908650001800931650001200949650001700961650001100978650001700989650002601006700002301032700001801055773010501073856008101178852000901259655001201268IND60575308720221120025324.0170728e201703  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057530872DNAL7 a10.1134/S10674136170200472doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBelousova, I.

Aiming to advance the optimization of feeding during the early stage of this species, this study examines the ontogeny of digestive function using molecular and biochemical approaches. Gene expression of digestive enzyme precursors and the enzymatic activity have been determined during the first 51 days post hatching (dph) and during the diurnal period of 19 dph larvae reared in semi-intensive conditions. The expression of pancreatic proteases precursors (try3, ctra and ctrb1) increased from first-feeding, while gastric chitinase (chia1), gastric protease (pga3) and proton pump (atp4a2) after 10 dph. The expression of pancreatic lipases (cel1, cel2 and cel3) peaked between 6 and 10 dph, phospholipase A2 (pla2g1b) rose only after 25 dph, while α-amylase (amy2a) increased mainly from 20 dph. The trypsin activity was more evident from first-feeding to 25 dph and chymotrypsin activity from this day onwards. Acidic chitinase and pepsin activity appeared, respectively, at 16 and 30. The activity of 7C-like lipase was evident from first-feeding but as 4C-like lipase significantly increased from 15 dph, while amylase peaked from 6 to 22 dph. Aminopeptidase and alkaline phosphatase activities started at 20 dph indicating the functional maturation of brush border of the enterocytes. The daily pattern analysis showed a food anticipatory strategy in the expression of proteases related genes. Lipases activity was more evident during the morning hours, followed by amylase, and by alkaline proteases in the afternoon. Results, also, suggested an alternation in the activity of chymotrypsin and trypsin. These ontogenetic patterns are concordant with a carnivorous marine teleost.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSeriola dumerili 3aalkaline phosphatase 3aalpha-amylase 3aaminopeptidases 3aaquaculture 3acarnivores 3achitinase 3achymotrypsin 3aenterocytes 3aenzyme activity 3agene expression 3amarine fish 3amicrovilli 3aontogeny 3apelagic fish 3apepsin 3aphospholipase A2 3aproton pump 3atrypsin 3aMediterranean region 0aDaily rhythm 0aDigestive genes 0aEnzymatic activity 0aLarvae ontogeny1 aYúfera, M.,1 ade las Heras, V.1 aSiguero, I.1 aGilannejad, N.1 aMartínez-Rodríguez, G.1 aNavarro-Guillén, C.0 tAquaculture.g2021 Mar. 15, v. 534 p.736330-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl59663x0044-84867nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquaculture.2020.7363303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03133naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001300155245011700168500001400285520169500299592002801994650004402022650002502066650001602091650001302107650003002120650001902150650001702169650001602186650001602202650001702218650002702235650001602262650002002278653002202298653001602320653002602336653002002362700001802382700001202400700001402412700001802426700001802444773009002462856009002552852000902642655001202651IND60722044720221120172756.0210312e202105  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072204472DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2020.1292802doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Xu10aBiodegradation and physiological response mechanism of a bacterial strain to 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene contamination  aNAL-light  aThe aim of this study was to reveal the biodegradation characteristics and physiological response mechanism of a newly isolated bacterium to 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (TNT) contamination. A Klebsiella variicola strain with high efficiency of TNT degradation was used as the test strain to analyze the changes in cell growth, morphology, and functional groups under different TNT concentrations (0, 100 mg⋅L⁻¹) and the effects of TNT stress on the metabolic profile as revealed by non-targeted metabonomics. A TNT concentration of 100 mg L⁻¹ caused a significant increase in the 5-day biochemical oxygen demand (BOD₅) to 950 mg L⁻¹, while the degradation rate of TNT reached 100% within 30 h after inoculation with Klebsiella variicola. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) analysis showed changes in the characteristic peak of triamide by TNT treatment. Non-targeted metabonomics identified a total of 544 differentially produced metabolites under TNT treatment (252 upregulated and 292 downregulated), mainly lipids and lipid-like molecules. The metabolic pathways associated with amino acid biosynthesis and metabolism were the most significantly enriched pathways, and simultaneous detection showed that TNT was degraded to 4-amino-2,6-dinitrotoluene (DNT), 2-hydroxylamino-4,6-DNT, 2-amino-4,6-DNT, 2-amino-4-nitrotoluene, and 2,4-DNT. These results confirmed that Klebsiella variicola has a high tolerance to TNT and efficiently degrades it. The degradation mechanism involves TNT-induced accelerated amino acid biosynthesis, production of a protease to catalyze the TNT transformation, and the participation of the transformed TNT products in cell metabolism.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aKlebsiella variicola 3aamino acids 3abacteria 3abiochemical oxygen demand 3abiodegradation 3abiosynthesis 3acell growth 3ametabolites 3ametabolomics 3aphysiological response 3aproteinases 3atrinitrotoluene 0aTNT contamination 0aDegradation 0aMicrobial remediation 0aMetabolic group1 aLai, Jin-long1 aLi, Jie1 aZhang, Yu1 aLuo, Xue-gang1 aLi, Zhan'guo,0 tChemosphere.g2021 May, v. 270 p.129280-dElsevier LtdwJournal:1969x0045-65357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2020.1292803Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03041naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001300155245011500168500001400283520158700297592002801884650001101912650001401923650004901937650001401986650001902000650001502019650000702034650001902041650001502060650002902075650001802104650001602122653001902138653002502157653001302182653001802195653002302213653001602236700001602252700001702268700001702285700001502302700001602317700001302333773009002346856009002436852000902526655001202535IND60722044820221120172721.0210312e202105  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072204482DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2020.1292952doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Yi10aIn-situ synthesis of CuS@carbon nanocomposites and application in enhanced photo-fenton degradation of 2,4-DCP  aNAL-light  aNovel CuS nanoparticles embedded into carbon nanosheets (CuS@CNs) were prepared in situ by applying wheat straw cellulose/feather protein hydrogel beads as templates and were used to photocatalytically activate H₂O₂ to degrade 2,4-dichlorphenol (2,4-DCP). The photo-Fenton catalytic properties of the nanocomposite catalysts obtained under different synthetic conditions, including different Cu²⁺ concentrations, S²⁻ concentrations and calcination temperatures, were evaluated. The results showed that CuS@CNs with 0.1 M Cu²⁺, 0.1 M S²⁻ at 800 °C presented excellent photo-Fenton degradation performance for 2,4-DCP (25 mg/L) in the presence of H₂O₂ and could remove 90% of 2,4-DCP in 2.5 h. The water quality parameters (pH, Cl⁻, HCO₃⁻, H₂PO₄⁻ and SO₄²⁻) exhibited different effects on the photocatalytic degradation process. The catalytic activity of the CuS@CNs used in the cycle could be recovered after thermal regeneration. Radical quenching and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) experiments confirmed that ·OH species were main active radicals contributing to the degradation of 2,4-DCP. The photocatalytic mechanism of CuS@CNs was also explored by photoelectrochemical (PEC) measurements and UV–vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS). Incorporation of carbon nanosheets could significantly improve the separation of photogenerated charge carriers to stimulate pollutant degradation by CuS. Based on the detected intermediates, the degradation pathway of 2,4-DCP in the CuS@CNs/H₂O₂ reaction system was also proposed.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon 3acellulose 3aelectron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy 3ahydrogels 3ananocomposites 3ananosheets 3apH 3aphotocatalysis 3apollutants 3areflectance spectroscopy 3awater quality 3awheat straw 0aCopper sulfide 0aCarbon nanocomposite 0aHydrogel 0aPhotocatalyst 0a2,4-dichlorophenol 0aDegradation1 aSu, Ruidian1 aWang, Fudong1 aZhou, Weizhi1 aGao, Baoyu1 aYue, Qinyan1 aLi, Qian0 tChemosphere.g2021 May, v. 270 p.129295-dElsevier LtdwJournal:1969x0045-65357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2020.1292953Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01965naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001500147245010800162300001600270520099300286592002801279650001801307650001001325650001301335650001601348650002201364650001001386700001701396700001601413700001501429773010501444856008101549852000901630655001201639IND60575309220221120191107.0170728e201703  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057530922DNAL7 a10.1134/S10674136172200272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXiao, Yian12aA global change of specialization and generalization in pollination networks from the plant perspective  ap. 143-151.  aA view of pollination systems is that they tend to generalization. Here we show that patterns exist in pollination systems that suggest otherwise. We examine how specialization may be affected by latitude, species richness and plant life-forms in 33 plant-pollinator interaction networks. Connectance increases with latitude (P = 0.040), but specialization at the community level significantly declines with increasing latitude, with the strongest evidence in the Northern Hemisphere (P = 0.001). The relationship between specialization level and connectance is negative (P < 0.001). While plants are more specialized in tropical areas and are more generalized at higher latitudes, specialization level also increases with plant richness (P < 0.001), total species richness (P = 0.041) and network size (P = 0.009). Specialization level of life forms of 1129 species differ substantially (P < 0.001), with herbs showing the highest specialization (74%), and tree species the lowest (62%).  aPublisher supplied data 3aglobal change 3aherbs 3alatitude 3apollination 3aspecies diversity 3atrees1 aLi, Xiaohong1 aCao, Yusong1 aHu, Wenhai0 tRussian journal of ecology.g2017 Mar., v. 48, no. 2 p.143-151dPleiades Publishingx1067-41367nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1134/S10674136172200273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03083naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001400155245012300169500001400292520152600306592002801832650002301860650001301883650002501896650001601921650002101937650002201958650001601980650003101996650001502027650002002042650000902062650002902071650001902100650004402119650001002163653003702173653002202210653002502232653003502257700005302292700001202345700005402357773009102411856009002502852000902592655001202601IND60722045120221120183945.0210212e202104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072204512DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2020.1293752doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhao, Yan10aExposure to organophosphate flame esters during early pregnancy and risk of spontaneous abortion: A case-control study  aNAL-light  aPrenatal exposure to organophosphate flame retardants (OPFRs) has been associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes including low birth weight and preterm birth. However, no study has addressed the impacts of OPFRs exposure on spontaneous abortion (SAB) and fetal chromosome abnormalities. We examined whether prenatal exposure to OPFRs was associated with increased risk of SAB and fetal chromosome abnormalities. A total of 272 pregnant women, including 136 SAB cases and 136 healthy controls, were enrolled in this case-control study. Urinary concentrations of 3 OPFRs metabolites (diphenyl phosphate (DPHP), bis (1,3-dichloro-2-propyl) phosphate (BDCIPP) and bis (1-chloro-2-propyl) phosphate (BCIPP)) were measured using ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS/MS). More than 70% of the urine samples detected quantifiable levels of 3 OPFRs metabolites. Concentrations of BCIPP were significantly higher in SAB cases than in healthy controls. Higher urinary BCIPP levels were associated with increased risk of SAB. Per unit increase in ln-transformed BCIPP concentrations was associated with 103% (OR = 2.03, 95% CI, 1.57, 2.63) increase in the odds of SAB. While higher BDCIPP levels were associated with increased risk of fetal chromosome abnormalities and the corresponding OR associated with a unit increase in ln-transformed BDCIPP concentrations were 2.34 (95% CI, 1.14, 4.81). Our results suggested the potential developmental toxicity and teratogenicity of some OPFRs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabortion (animals) 3abiphenyl 3acase-control studies 3achromosomes 3alow birth weight 3amaternal exposure 3ametabolites 3aorganophosphorus compounds 3aphosphates 3apremature birth 3arisk 3atandem mass spectrometry 3ateratogenicity 3aultra-performance liquid chromatography 3aurine 0aOrganophosphate flame retardants 0aPrenatal exposure 0aSpontaneous abortion 0aFetal chromosome abnormalities1 aDing, Jie1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5229-53981 aLv, Lei1 aZhang, Hai1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9177-38550 tChemosphere.g2021 Apr., v. 268 p.129375-dElsevier LtdwJournal:1969x0045-65357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2020.1293753Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03313naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100005900155245011100214520172000325592002802045650001402073650001302087650002902100650001902129650002102148650002302169650001702192650002202209650001602231650001302247650001402260650002802274650001602302650001802318650001702336650002002353653003602373653002602409653003702435653003802472653002402510700002002534700001702554700002102571700002502592773009102617856009002708852000902798655001202807IND60722045220221120193606.0220103e202106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072204522DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2020.1293772doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRyan, Donald R.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6721-499X10aElectrocoagulation-electrooxidation for mitigating trace organic compounds in model drinking water sources  aIn-situ water treatment can be accomplished using electrochemical treatments such as electrocoagulation (EC), which generates coagulants, and electrooxidation (EO), which generates oxidants (e.g., free chlorine and reactive oxygen species) via electrolysis using boron-doped diamond electrodes. In sequential EC-EO, EC can remove oxidant scavengers present in dissolved organic carbon (DOC), thereby improving the efficacy of downstream oxidation via EO. This study evaluated sequential EC-EO (and each process independently for comparison) for mitigating the trace organic compounds (TOrCs) acyclovir (ACY), trimethoprim (TMP), and benzyldimethyldecylammonium chloride (BAC-C10) in model groundwaters and surface waters. EO-only removed greater than 70% of ACY and TMP but negligible BAC-C10 in model groundwaters. In model surface waters, EO-only removed ∼55–75% BAC-C10, but had less removal for ACY and TMP (∼20–55%), primarily due to DOC interference. Sequential-EC-EO was investigated to better gauge the potential process improvement due to the addition of EC ahead of EO. EC removed 74 ± 7% DOC from model surface water and improved downstream EO treatment relative to EO-only by a factor of 3.4 for ACY, 1.7 for TMP, and 1.4 for BAC-C10. When treating model groundwater, EC-EO resulted in no improvement compared to EO-only for ACY and TMP. BAC-C10 removal was attributed to the particle separation step between EC and EO rather than electrochemical inputs. EO-only treatment was more energy efficient for model groundwater compared to model surface waters based on electrical energy per order (EEO) values. Sequential EC-EO further improved the energy efficiency for treating model river water.  aPublisher supplied data 3achlorides 3achlorine 3adissolved organic carbon 3aelectric power 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrocoagulation 3aelectrolysis 3aenergy efficiency 3agroundwater 3aoxidants 3aoxidation 3areactive oxygen species 3ariver water 3asurface water 3atrimethoprim 3awater treatment 0aElectrochemical water treatment 0aBenzalkonium chloride 0aAdvanced oxidation process (AOP) 0aElectrical energy per order (EEO) 0aBoron-doped diamond1 aMaher, Emily K.1 aHeffron, Joe1 aMayer, Brooke K.1 aMcNamara, Patrick J.0 tChemosphere.g2021 June, v. 273 p.129377-dElsevier LtdwJournal:1969x0045-65357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2020.1293773Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03368naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100006000155245012700215500001400342520174200356592002802098650003502126650001602161650003402177650001602211650001702227650000902244650001902253650001102272650001102283650001902294650001302313653001602326653002302342653002802365700005502393700003202448700001902480700006902499700002202568700006402590700002302654700002002677773009002697856009002787852000902877655001202886IND60722045520221120132304.0210312e202105  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072204552DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2020.1293882doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBrinza, Loredana1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2502-445810aGeochemical investigations of noble metal-bearing ores: Synchrotron-based micro-analyses and microcosm bioleaching studies  aNAL-light  aAuriferous sulphide ores often incorporate micro-fine (or invisible) gold and silver particles in a manner making their extraction difficult. Nobel metals are lost in the tailings due to the refractory nature of these ores. Bioleaching is an environment-friendly alternative to the commonly used and toxic cyanidation protocols for gold extraction from refractory ores. In this paper, we investigate gold and silver bioleaching from porphyry and epithermal mineralisation systems, using iron-oxidizing bacteria Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans. The invisible Au, sequestered in refractory ores, was characterised in situ by synchrotron micro X-Ray Fluorescence (SR-μ-XRF) and X-ray Absorption Spectroscopy (XAS), offering information on Au unaltered speciation at the atomistic level within the ore matrices and at a micro-scale spatial resolution. The SR-μ-XRF and XAS results showed that 10–20 μm sized elemental Au(0) nuggets are sequestered in pyrite, chalcopyrite, arsenopyrite matrices and at the interface of a mixture of pyrite and chalcopyrite. Moreover, the preliminary bioleaching experiments of the two types of ores, showed that Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans can catalyse the dissolution of natural heterogeneous Fe-rich geo-matrices, sequestering Au and Ag and releasing particulate phases or partially solubilising them within 60 days. These results provide an understanding of noble metal sequestration and speciation within natural ores and a demonstration of the application of synchrotron-based micro-analysis in characterizing economic trace metals in major mineral structures. This work is a contribution to the ongoing efforts towards finding feasible and greener solutions of noble metal extraction protocols.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAcidithiobacillus ferrooxidans 3aX-radiation 3aX-ray absorption spectroscopy 3abioleaching 3afluorescence 3agold 3amineralization 3apyrite 3asilver 3asolubilization 3atoxicity 0aSynchrotron 0aX-ray fluorescence 0aIron-oxidizing bacteria1 aAhmed, Imad1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3868-29191 aCismasiu, Carmen - Madalina1 aArdelean, Ioan1 aBreaban, Iuliana Gabriela1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9201-18601 aDoroftei, Florica1 aIgnatyev, Konstantin1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8937-56551 aMoisescu, Cristina1 aNeamtu, Mariana0 tChemosphere.g2021 May, v. 270 p.129388-dElsevier LtdwJournal:1969x0045-65357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2020.1293883Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03225naa a2200733 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100005300155245013000208500001400338520127500352592002801627650001501655650001901670650001401689650001501703650001701718650002501735650000901760650001901769650001301788650001101801650001401812650001301826650001801839653002401857653004101881653002901922653002901951653000701980653000901987653001401996653000802010653000802018653000802026653001002034653000802044653000702052653001402059653001402073653001102087653001002098653000702108653000702115653000802122653000802130653000802138700001502146700001302161700001502174700001502189700001602204700001502220700001802235700002202253700001402275773009102289856009002380852000902470655001202479IND60722045720221120112847.0210226e202104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072204572DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2020.1294032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Nan1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7691-420210aSynchronization of dehydration and phosphorous immobilization for river sediment by calcified polyferric sulfate pretreatment  aNAL-light  aDisposal of dredged river sediment requires decreases in both water content for reduction in disposal area, and the amount of eutrophication pollutants at risking of leaching. The effects of CaCl₂, polyferric sulfate (PFS) and calcified polyferric sulfate (CaPFS) on dewatering and phosphorus immobilization were examined. Upon CaPFS dosage of 1.88 mg Ca + Fe kg⁻¹ raw sediment (RS) the moisture content of the sediment was 41.1 wt% after pressure filtration, with filtrate dissolved inorganic phosphorus (DIP) of 6.1 mg L⁻¹; better outcomes than for equivalent dosages of CaCl₂ or PFS. On CaPFS dosage of 4.98 mg Ca + Fe kg⁻¹ RS, DIP in the filtrate was <0.5 mg L⁻¹. Dosages of CaCl₂ and PFS required to achieve <0.5 mg L⁻¹ DIP were 6.79 mg Ca kg⁻¹ RS and 5.64 mg Fe kg⁻¹ RS. CaPFS aids particle surface charge neutralization and sweep flocculation by polymeric iron, improving dehydration efficiency. Synergistic effects of aqueous Ca and Fe promote P stability reducing DIP mobility. For treatment of 10000 m³ of this dredged sediment, CaPFS has the potential to reduce the discharge of eutrophicated water by 74 ± 6% compared with PAC + PAM conditioning, demonstrating the promising application of CaPFS conditioning.  aPublisher supplied data 3adewatering 3aeutrophication 3afiltrates 3afiltration 3aflocculation 3ainorganic phosphorus 3airon 3aneutralization 3apolymers 3arivers 3asediments 3asulfates 3awater content 0aSediment dewatering 0aCalcified polyferric sulfate (CaPFS) 0aPhosphate immobilization 0aRiver-lakes water system 0aCa 0aCaO2 0aCa + Fe 0aPAC 0aPAM 0aPFS 0aCaPFS 0aDIP 0aTP 0aNH4Cl–P 0aFe/Al–P 0aCa–P 0aRes-P 0aRS 0aWC 0aSRF 0aCST 0aD501 aXiao, Hang1 aPi, Kewu1 aFang, Jing1 aLiu, Shuze1 aChen, Yuhan1 aShi, Yafei1 aZhang, Huiqin1 aGerson, Andrea R.1 aLiu, Defu0 tChemosphere.g2021 Apr., v. 269 p.129403-dElsevier LtdwJournal:1969x0045-65357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2020.1294033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03007naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001600155245009100171500001400262520166600276592002801942650002301970650001201993650001102005650001802016650001702034650001702051651001002068653001302078653001302091653001702104653001702121653002502138653003302163700001902196700005702215700001802272700006502290700002902355773009002384856009002474852000902564655001202573IND60722047720221123042245.0210312e202105  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072204772DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2020.1294352doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGoel, Vikas10aVariations in Black Carbon concentration and sources during COVID-19 lockdown in Delhi  aNAL-light  aA nationwide lockdown was imposed in India due to COVID-19 pandemic in five phases from 25th March to May 31, 2020. The lockdown restricted major anthropogenic activities, primarily vehicular and industrial, thereby reducing the particulate matter concentration. This work investigates the variation in Black Carbon (BC) concentration and its sources (primarily Fossil Fuel (ff) burning and Biomass Burning (bb)) over Delhi from 18th February to July 31, 2020, covering one month of pre-lockdown phase, all the lockdown phases, and two months of successive lockdown relaxations. The daily average BC concentration varied from 0.22 to 16.92 μg/m³, with a mean value of 3.62 ± 2.93 μg/m³. During Pre-Lockdown (PL, 18th Feb-24th March 2020), Lockdown-1 (L1, 25th March-14th April 2020), Lockdown-2 (L2, 15th April-3rd May 2020), Lockdown-3 (L3, 4th-17th May 2020), Lockdown-4 (L4, 18th-31st May 2020), Unlock-1 (UN1, June 2020), and Unlock-2 (UN2, July 2020) the average BC concentrations were 7.93, 1.73, 2.59, 3.76, 3.26, 2.07, and 2.70 μg/m³, respectively. During the lockdown and unlock phases, BC decreased up to 78% compared to the PL period. The BC source apportionment studies show that fossil fuel burning was the dominant BC source during the entire sampling period. From L1 to UN2 an increasing trend in BCff contribution was observed (except L3) due to the successive relaxations given to anthropogenic activities. BCff contribution dipped briefly during L3 due to the intensive crop residue burning events in neighboring states. CWT analysis showed that local emission sources were the dominant contributors to BC concentration over Delhi.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCOVID-19 infection 3abiomass 3acarbon 3acrop residues 3afossil fuels 3aparticulates 3aIndia 0aCOVID-19 0aLockdown 0aBlack carbon 0aAethalometer 0aSource apportionment 0aAbsorption angstrom exponent1 aHazarika, Naba1 aKumar, Mayank1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4478-87981 aSingh, Vikram1 aThamban, Navaneeth M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9370-02111 aTripathi, Sachchida Nand0 tChemosphere.g2021 May, v. 270 p.129435-dElsevier LtdwJournal:1969x0045-65357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2020.1294353Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03079naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001400147245012400161300001600285520158800301592002801889650002501917650002101942650001201963650001901975650002501994650001502019650001402034650001502048650001702063650001502080650001102095650001102106650001202117650001302129650001402142650002802156650002002184650001002204650002002214650001402234650001102248650001302259700001602272700001402288700001702302700001602319700001402335773009802349856008102447852000902528655001202537IND60575312720221121115111.0170728e201706  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057531272DNAL7 a10.1007/s10535-017-0745-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, L.14aThe analysis of mutant phenotypes and tissue expression reveals a role of SNAREs VAMP721 and VAMP722 in seedling growth  ap. 275-283.  aMembrane traffic mediated by a soluble N-ethylmaleimide sensitive factor attachment protein receptor (SNARE) complex contributes to plant growth and development. However, the functional significance of SNAREs involved in cell wall deposition and seedling development has not been sufficiently explored. In this study, we explored the roles of R-SNAREs VAMP721 (At1g04750) and VAMP722 (At2g33120) in seedling growth of Arabidopsis thaliana by histochemical staining, fluorescence labeling, and analyzing mutant phenotypes. Our results show a massive intracellular accumulation of cellulose and callose, and an abnormal deposition of callose at the expanding cell plate in vamp721vamp722 root cells compared with the wild type. Particularly, ectopic lignin accumulation was also observed in vamp721vamp722 root cells. The alteration of cell wall components was confirmed using Fourier transform infrared analysis. Plasma membrane integrity and cell viability were disturbed in the vamp721vamp722 seedling. Morphological observation shows that vamp721vamp722 mutations impaired development of roots, hypocotyl, cotyledon, and true leaf, and inhibited lateral root formation. Confocal images reveal that green fluorescent protein-tagged VAMP721 and VAMP722 showed a similar expression pattern and were expressed throughout all cells and tissues examined, including root and shoot apical meristems and cells of hypocotyls, cotyledons, and true leaves. Taken together, our results suggest that membrane traffic mediated by VAMP721 and VAMP722 is involved in seedling growth in A. thaliana.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3aapical meristems 3acallose 3acell viability 3acell wall components 3acell walls 3acellulose 3acotyledons 3afluorescence 3ahypocotyls 3aleaves 3alignin 3amutants 3amutation 3aphenotype 3aphysiological transport 3aplasma membrane 3aroots 3aseedling growth 3aseedlings 3ashoots 3astaining1 aZhao, H.

In order to better understand the role of EIN3/EILs, one EIN3-like gene (designated ZmEIL1) was isolated from maize (Zea mays L.). The full-length cDNA of ZmEIL1 was 1 999 bp in length and encoded 647 amino acids. Sequence comparison of ZmEIL1 protein with other EIN3/EILs proteins revealed high conservation of five α-helices that could form a V-shaped cleft in a 3-D model, just like AtEIL3 in Arabidopsis thaliana. This protein showed transcriptional activation and activation domain located on the 507 - 647 amino acids in yeast. Furthermore, ZmEIL1 could interact with ZmERF1 in the yeast systems, which was downstream response factor in ethylene signal transduction pathway. Its mRNA could be highly induced in maize seedlings by ethephon and 1-methylcyclopropene treatments. Meanwhile, ZmEIL1 showed relatively high expression at 20 d after pollination in maize kernel. These results show that ZmEIL1 played an important role in the growth and development by participating in ethylene signalling pathway in maize.  aPublisher supplied data 3a1-methylcyclopropene 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3aZea mays 3aamino acids 3acomplementary DNA 3acorn 3aethephon 3aethylene 3agenes 3amessenger RNA 3amodels 3apollination 3aseedlings 3aseeds 3asequence analysis 3asignal transduction 3atranscription factors 3atranscriptional activation 3ayeasts1 aDong, Y.

In the present study, the changes in the concentration of air pollutants after the implementation of APPCAP were investigated based on nationwide monitoring data. From the results, it is evident that the annual mean concentrations of PM₂.₅, PM₁₀, SO₂, and CO show a significant downward trend over 2015–2018, with decreasing rates of 3.4, 4.1, 3.8, and 70 μg m⁻³/year, respectively. However, no significant change was found in NO₂ while maximum daily 8 h average O₃ concentration (MDA8 O₃) was increased by 3.4 μg m⁻³/year during the four years. Spatially, the highest decrease in PM₂.₅ was found in Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei (BTH), followed by central China and northeast China, while the Pearl River Delta (PRD), Yungui Plateau, and northwest China showed less decreases. MDA8 O₃ had a higher increase in BTH, central China, Yangtze River Delta (YRD), and PRD. With the decrease in PM₂.₅ in recent years, cumulative population exposure to PM₂.₅ gradually decreased, whereas there was still more than 65% of the population exposing to annual PM₂.₅ higher than the standard of 35 μg m⁻³ in 2018. In contrast, the health effects of O₃ gradually increased with 13.1%, 14.3%, 20.4%, and 21.7% of the population exposed to unhealthy O₃ levels in summer from 2015 to 2018. O₃ pollution is causing severe health risks with estimated nationwide mortality of 70,024 (95% CI: 55,510–84,501), 79,159 (95% CI: 62,750–95,525), 105,150 (95% CI: 83,378–126,852), and 104,404 (95% CI: 82,784–125,956) in the four years, respectively. This clearly shows that the target of air pollution control in China shifts and coordinated control of PM₂.₅ and O₃ is urgently needed after the successful implementation of APPCAP.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3aair pollution 3aair pollution control 3aair quality 3amortality 3ariver deltas 3arivers 3asummer 3aChina 3aYangtze River 0aPM2.5 0aOzone 0aHealth risk1 aChen, Kai-Yu,1 aLiu, Zhen1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1116-28521 aZhang, Yuxin1 aShao, Tian1 aZhang, Hongliang0 tChemosphere.g2021 May, v. 270 p.129441-dElsevier LtdwJournal:1969x0045-65357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2020.1294413Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02327naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001300147245005200160300001600212500001100228520117400239592002801413650001801441650001601459650001501475650001201490650001701502650001401519650001201533650001001545650002401555650002201579650001701601650001901618650002201637650002601659650001701685700001501702773009801717856008101815852000901896655001201905IND60575313320221122033334.0170728e201706  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057531332DNAL7 a10.1007/s10535-016-0700-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKaur, G.10aMolecular responses to drought stress in plants  ap. 201-209.  aReview  aDrought is a severe environmental constraint to plant productivity. Being a multidimensional stress, it triggers a wide variety of plant responses ranging from physiological, biochemical to molecular levels. One of the inevitable consequences of drought stress is an increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in different cellular compartments, namely the chloroplasts and mitochondria. This enhanced ROS production is, however, kept under tight control by a versatile and cooperative antioxidant system that modulates intracellular ROS content and sets the redoxstatus of the cell. Furthermore, ROS production under stresses functions as an alarm signal that triggers defence or acclimation. Specific signal transduction pathways involve, e.g., H₂O₂ as a secondary messenger. ROS signalling under drought is linked to abscisic acid (ABA) and Ca²⁺ fluxes. At molecular levels, several drought-responsive genes, transcription factors, aquaporins, late embryogenesis abundant proteins, heat shock proteins, and dehydrins have been identified. This review discusses recent understanding on molecular responses and protective mechanisms of drought stress.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabscisic acid 3aacclimation 3aaquaporins 3acalcium 3achloroplasts 3adehydrins 3adrought 3agenes 3aheat shock proteins 3ahydrogen peroxide 3amitochondria 3aplant response 3asecond messengers 3atranscription factors 3awater stress1 aAsthir, B.0 tBiologia plantarum.g2017 June, v. 61, no. 2 p.201-209dSpringer Netherlandsx0006-31347nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10535-016-0700-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02898naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245011500168300001600283520159400299592002801893650002001921650001201941650001401953650001401967650002501981650001202006650002202018650001102040650001202051650001102063650001502074650002102089650001202110650001002122650002102132650001002153650002002163650001202183700001802195700001302213700001402226773009802240856008102338852000902419655001202428IND60575313620221122033351.0170728e201706  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057531362DNAL7 a10.1007/s10535-016-0695-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDewindara Kaura,10aDifferential proline metabolism in vegetative and reproductive tissues determine drought tolerance in chickpea  ap. 359-366.  aProline is emerging as a critical component of drought tolerance and fine tuning of its metabolism under stress affects the plants sensitivity and response to stress. Thus the study was carried out to analyse the effect of water deficit on the proline content and principal enzymes involved in its synthesis (Δ¹-pyrolline-carboxylate synthetase) and catabolism (proline dehydrogenase) at different developmental stages and in different organs (roots, nodules, leaves, pod wall, and seeds) of two chickpea (Cicer arietinum L.) cultivars differing in drought tolerance (drought tolerant ICC4958 and drought sensitive ILC3279). It was observed that increased Δ¹-pyrolline-carboxylate synthetase activity under moderate stress in roots and nodules of ICC4958 caused an increase in proline content during initiation of reproductive development whereas increased proline dehydrogenase activity in nodules and leaves at this period helped to maintain reducing power and energy supply in tissues and proper seed development as seed biomass increased consistently up to maturity. On the other hand, roots and nodules of ILC3279 responded to stress by increasing proline content after the developmental phase of reproductive organs was over (near maturity) which negatively affected the response of pod wall to stress. Concurrent increase in activities of Δ¹-pyrolline-carboxylate synthetase and proline dehydrogenase in pod wall of ILC3279 aggravated the oxidative stress and affected seed development as seed biomass initially increased rapidly under stress but was unaffected near maturity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCicer arietinum 3abiomass 3achickpeas 3acultivars 3adevelopmental stages 3adrought 3adrought tolerance 3aenergy 3aenzymes 3aleaves 3ametabolism 3aoxidative stress 3aproline 3aroots 3aseed development 3aseeds 3astress response 3atissues1 aGrewal, S.

In this paper, a novel photocatlyst, SnO₂/SnIn₄S₈, was fabricated by in situ precipitation and hydrothermal method and then employed to simulate photocatalytic degradation of olaquindox under visible light. The SEM, TEM, XRD, XPS and electrochemical results clearly showed that the n-type heterojunction between SnO₂ and SnIn₄S₈ was successfully constructed, which greatly reduce the recombination of the photogenic electron and holes, leading to the improvement of photocalytic performance and stability (recycled over 10 times). Besides, the SnO₂/SnIn₄S₈ composite also exhibited good ability to mineralize the olaquindox. Under the optimal condition (pH of 3, 1 g L⁻¹ of 30 wt% SnO₂/SnIn₄S₈ and 10 mg L⁻¹ of initial olaquindox concentration), the olaquindox could be fully and rapidly degraded in 25 min, and completely mineralized in 2 h (99.3 ± 1.7%). LC-QTOF-MS analysis evidently displayed 10 intermediates during the olaquindox degradation. In addition, with the attack of the reactive oxygen species (h⁺, •OH and •O₂⁻), olaquindox could be effectively decomposed via deoxygenation, hydroxylation and carboxylation reactions. Importantly, compared to photodegradation, the photocatalytic process was an ideal way to eliminate the olaquindox form water because it could avoid the accumulation of toxic byproducts.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarboxylation 3aelectrochemistry 3ahot water treatment 3ahydroxylation 3alight 3amineralization 3aolaquindox 3apH 3aphotocatalysis 3aphotolysis 3aremediation 3arisk 3atoxicity 3aveterinary drugs 0aPhotocatalysis 0aVeterinary drug 0aDegration 0aPathway 0aMetal sulfide photocatalysts1 aYu, Zhendong1 aHuang, Siyi1 aDeng, Fucai1 aZheng, Kaiyun1 aYang, Guifang1 aLiu, Yifan1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9082-65481 aLin, Chunxiang1 aYe, Xiaoxia1 aLiu, Minghua0 tChemosphere.g2021 May, v. 271 p.129452-dElsevier LtdwJournal:1969x0045-65357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2020.1294523Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02884naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092024002200127024001900149040001800168100002400186245012200210300001600332506007600348520157900424592002802003506003702031650002102068650001102089650001402100650002402114650001302138650001102151650002402162651001502186700002502201700002402226700002202250700002002272700002302292773009002315856004802405852000902453655001202462IND4467464020221207133455.0121003e201104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446746402DNAL7 a10.1007/s00227-010-1620-42doi7 aPMC38730522pmcid7 a243912642pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCartamil, Daniel P.10aArchival tagging of subadult and adult common thresher sharks (Alopias vulpinus) off the coast of southern California  ap. 935-944.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe common thresher shark (Alopias vulpinus) is a secondary target species of the California drift gillnet fishery (CA-DGN) and supports a growing recreational fishery in California waters. This study used archival tags to examine the movement patterns and habitat preferences of common threshers of the size range captured in the CA-DGN (>120 cm fork length). Depth and temperature-logging archival tags were deployed on 57 subadult and adult common threshers in the Southern California Bight. Tags from five individuals (8.8%) were recovered, and 154 days of data were successfully obtained from four of these. By night, shark movements were primarily limited to waters above the thermocline, which ranged in depth from 15 to 20 m. Sharks were significantly deeper by day, and daytime vertical distribution consisted of two distinct modes: a ‘shallow mode’ (wherein sharks occupied only the upper 20 m of the water column) and a ‘deep mode’ (characterized by frequent vertical excursions below the thermocline). This modal switch is interpreted as relating to regional differences in abundance of surface-oriented prey and prey in deeper water. Maximum dive depth was 320 m, greatest dive duration was 712 min, minimum temperature experienced during a dive was 9.1°C, and dive descent rate was significantly greater than ascent rate. Sharks inhabited waters corresponding to a sea surface temperature range of 16 to 21°C. The nocturnal depth distribution of common threshers has implications for management of drift gillnet deployment depths in the CA-DGN.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aAlopias vulpinus 3acoasts 3afisheries 3ahabitat preferences 3aseawater 3asharks 3asurface temperature 3aCalifornia1 aSepulveda, Chugey A.1 aWegner, Nicholas C.1 aAalbers, Scott A.1 aBaquero, Andres1 aGraham, Jeffrey B.0 tMarine biology.g2011 Apr., v. 158, no. 4 p.935-944dSpringer-Verlagx0025-31627nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00227-010-1620-4  aDNAL 7aarticle02618naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100002400155245008400179500001400263520115100277592002801428650002101456650002401477650001301501650002401514650002001538650002301558650002501581650002401606650000701630650001501637650001701652650001001669650001101679650000901690653001601699653003001715653002201745653002001767700006101787700006101848700002101909700001701930773009001947856009002037852000902127655001202136IND60722049420221120081011.0210312e202105  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072204942DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2020.1294632doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTolofari, Ayaobu A.10aBioavailability study of phosphorus in alum-phosphorus sludge using switchgrass  aNAL-light  aThe study investigated biomass yield and the uptake of P and aluminum by switchgrass grown in a low-P soil amended with alum-P sludge and a conventional fertilizer, monoammonium phosphate (MAP), at rates of 9.7, 19.4, 29.1 and 38.8 mg P kg⁻¹ dry soil. Potted soil (amended and control) units were seeded with pre-germinated switchgrass and harvested three times at 50-day intervals. Over the three growth cycles, P from alum-P sludge gradually became available. Amendment rate showed no significant effect on switchgrass biomass yield. P availability was greater for alum-P sludge than MAP and this may have been enhanced by the properties and activities of the plant root system. Aluminum (Al) uptake by switchgrass increased with the number of cycles, but did not differ significantly among treatments. Cumulative Al uptake over the 3 cycles was greater for below-ground biomass than for above-ground biomass. Maximum P recovery efficiency of 28% was achieved at the 9.7 mg P kg soil⁻¹ rate. These results demonstrate that alum-P sludge is an effective source of available P for cropping switchgrass in a high pH and low Olsen-P soil.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPanicum virgatum 3aaboveground biomass 3aaluminum 3abelowground biomass 3abioavailability 3abiomass production 3adiammonium phosphate 3amineral fertilizers 3apH 3aphosphorus 3aroot systems 3aroots 3asludge 3asoil 0aSwitchgrass 0aAluminum phosphate sludge 0aPhosphorus uptake 0aAluminum uptake1 aAgomoh, Ikechukwu1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5735-22721 aAdesanya, Theresa1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3810-43451 aZvomuya, Francis1 aYuan, Qiuyan0 tChemosphere.g2021 May, v. 270 p.129463-dElsevier LtdwJournal:1969x0045-65357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2020.1294633Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02321naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245013200164300001600296520101800312592002801330650002101358650002901379650002801408650001701436650001701453650001301470650001001483650001801493650002201511650002801533650000701561650001301568650003901581700001701620700001901637700001301656700001301669700001401682773010101696856008101797852000901878655001201887IND60575314320221122063132.0170728e201706  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057531432DNAL7 a10.1007/s10529-017-2314-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Qingdai10aCo-expression of L-glutamate oxidase and catalase in Escherichia coli to produce α-ketoglutaric acid by whole-cell biocatalyst  ap. 913-919.  aOBJECTIVES: To improve the production of α-ketoglutaric acid (α-KG) from L-glutamate by whole-cell biocatalysis. RESULTS: A novel and highly active L-glutamate oxidase, SmlGOX, from Streptomyces mobaraensis was overexpressed and purified. The recombinant SmlGOX was approx. 64 kDa by SDS-PAGE. SmlGOX had a maximal activity of 125 ± 2.7 U mg⁻¹ at pH 6.0, 35 ᵒC. The apparent Kₘ and Vₘₐₓ values of SmlGOX were 9.3 ± 0.5 mM and 159 ± 3 U mg⁻¹, respectively. Subsequently, a co-expression plasmid containing the SmlGOX and KatE genes was constructed to remove H₂O₂, and the protein levels of SmlGOX were improved by codon optimization. Finally, by optimizing the whole-cell transformation conditions, the production of α-KG reached 77.4 g l⁻¹ with a conversion rate from L-glutamate of 98.5% after 12 h. CONCLUSIONS: An efficient method for the production of α-KG was established in the recombinant Escherichia coli, and it has a potential prospect in industrial application.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3aStreptomyces mobaraensis 3aalpha-ketoglutaric acid 3abiocatalysis 3abiocatalysts 3acatalase 3agenes 3aglutamic acid 3ahydrogen peroxide 3aindustrial applications 3apH 3aplasmids 3apolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis1 aMa, Xiaoqian1 aCheng, Haijiao1 aXu, Ning1 aLiu, Jun1 aMa, Yanhe0 tBiotechnology letters.g2017 June, v. 39, no. 6 p.913-919dSpringer Netherlandsx0141-54927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10529-017-2314-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03037naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001900155245015900174500001400333520154700347592002801894650002601922650001501948650002101963650001601984650002302000650001102023650001502034650001702049650002102066650001402087650001902101650001902120650001802139650002202157650000902179650002902188650002002217650002502237653002502262653001302287700001702300700001902317700001802336773009002354856009002444852000902534655001202543IND60722049620221120080943.0210312e202105  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072204962DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2020.1294732doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Chaofan10aPhytotoxic effect and molecular mechanism induced by nanodiamonds towards aquatic Chlorella pyrenoidosa by integrating regular and transcriptomic analyses  aNAL-light  aThe growing diverse applications of nanodiamonds (NDs), especially as adsorbents and catalysts for wastewater treatment, have significantly increased their discharge and potential risk towards aquatic ecosystems. Although NDs have been certified for superior biocompatibility and lower toxicity towards numerous human cell lines, the characteristic response and underlying mechanism of aquatic microalgal response remains unclear. Here, the response of Chlorella pyrenoidosa to five concentrations of NDs was thoroughly investigated by comprehensive phenotypic and transcriptional examinations. Results indicated that higher concentration of NDs (50 mg/L) induced 75.4% growth inhibition, exacerbated oxidative stress and malformed morphology of microalgae after 48 h exposure. Meanwhile, the aggregated microalgae formed several flocs, apparently under 50 mg/L NDs. Noticeably, photosynthesis was susceptible to the NDs exposure. Although, the chlorophyll content and genes involved in photosynthesis were significantly improved by NDs, the results obtained from the photochemical parameters indicated that the excessive electrons during photosynthesis might be a pivotal reason for oxidative stress generation. Additionally, the genes included in amino acids metabolism and protein synthesis were up-regulated to alleviate the oxidative stress. Collectively, this work discloses the explicit molecular mechanisms of aquatic microalgae and provides comprehensive insights of potential aqueous environmental risk of gradually emergent NDs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChlorella pyrenoidosa 3aadsorbents 3abiocompatibility 3achlorophyll 3agrowth retardation 3ahumans 3amicroalgae 3ananodiamonds 3aoxidative stress 3aphenotype 3aphotochemistry 3aphotosynthesis 3aphytotoxicity 3aprotein synthesis 3arisk 3atranscription (genetics) 3atranscriptomics 3awastewater treatment 0aCarbon nanomaterials 0aToxicity1 aChen, Xudong1 aChou, Wei-Chun1 aHo, Shih-Hsin0 tChemosphere.g2021 May, v. 270 p.129473-dElsevier LtdwJournal:1969x0045-65357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2020.1294733Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03203naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100002600155245011900181500001400300520150300314592002801817650001301845650001801858650002501876650001001901650001701911650001501928650001101943650001401954650001801968650002101986650001302007650001202020650001502032651001002047653003202057653001902089653002002108653003202128653002202160700002602182700002602208700006002234700002402294700001602318700006502334700001902399700001902418700002202437773009102459856009002550852000902640655001202649IND60722050220221119151857.0210212e202104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072205022DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2020.1294882doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSinha, Sukesh Narayan10aToxicokinetic analysis of commonly used pesticides using data on acute poisoning cases from Hyderabad, South India  aNAL-light  aOrganophosphorus pesticides (OPs) interfere with the activity of acetylcholinesterase (AChE), a vital enzyme that regulates the functioning of the nervous system, resulting in acetylcholine (Ach) accumulation at the synapses and myoneural junctions. It remains unknown whether the commonly used OPs in South India also interfere with the AChE activity and their toxicokinetics in humans remains poorly understood. We collected peripheral blood samples from OP-associated suicide cases (hospitalised) and analysed the pesticide concentration and AChE activity, and the toxicokinetics of six commonly used pesticides. LC-MS/MS was used for the estimation of pesticide concentration. Based on a comparison of six pesticide kinetic profiles and toxicokinetic parameters, we concluded that chlorpyrifos ingestion resulted in the highest concentration of chlopyrifos among the identified pesticides, followed by acephate, triazophos, propanil, while dimethoate exhibited the lowest concentration. Based on a time-course analysis, we observed a faster elimination phase for monocrotophos and dimethoate. We observed that there was a significant decrease in the mean concentration of monocrotophos (64 ng/mL) (P = 0.015), while the mean value of AChE (1.08 unit/mL) increased over time. While monocrotophos and dimethoate elimination phases were remarkable in human subjects, the other pesticides did notdemonstrate similar elimination phases owing to their low rate of metabolism and high stability.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacephate 3aacetylcholine 3aacetylcholinesterase 3ablood 3achlorpyrifos 3adimethoate 3ahumans 3aingestion 3amonocrotophos 3apharmacokinetics 3apropanil 3asuicide 3atriazophos 3aIndia 0aOrganophosphorus pesticides 0aToxicokinetics 0aPoisoning cases 0aAcetylcholinesterase (AChE) 0aElimination phase1 aKumar, Kumpati Rajesh1 aUngarala, Ramakrishna1 aKumar, Dileshwar1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0012-52981 aDeshpande, Abhijeet1 aVasudev, K.1 aBoiroju, Naveen Kumar1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0521-39561 aSingh, Amrisha1 aNaik, R.

In the present review, recent biotechnological attempts and advances in TIAs production through transformed hairy root cultures in R. stricta are reviewed to draw the attention to its metabolic engineering potential.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRhazya stricta 3abiotechnology 3aindole alkaloids 3amedicinal plants 3amedicinal properties 3ametabolic engineering 3asecondary metabolites 3aterpenoids 3aIndia 3aMiddle East1 aOksman-Caldentey, Kirsi-Marja1 aRischer, Heiko0 tBiotechnology letters.g2017 June, v. 39, no. 6 p.829-840dSpringer Netherlandsx0141-54927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10529-017-2320-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01716naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245010800164300001600272520065700288592002800945650001700973650001500990650001801005650001601023650001601039650001601055650001701071650001301088700002001101700001801121700001701139773011901156856008201275852000901357655001201366IND60574101120221116152042.0220819e201702  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057410112DNAL7 a10.1007/s10529-016-2242-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKhan, Samiya10aDegradation of carbazole, dibenzothiophene and polyaromatic hydrocarbons by recombinant Rhodococcus sp.  ap. 277-281.  aOBJECTIVES: With the view of designing a single biocatalyst for biorefining, carbazole dioxygenase was cloned from Pseudomonas sp. and expressed in Rhodococcus sp.

The Spanish Sport Horse (SSH) was used in this study as an example to develop a method to ascertain the influence of parental breeds on particular performances by linking their parental genetic contribution with the individual phenotype value computing the optimal breed contribution for each trait evaluated in eventing. Data included 1220 eventing records from 210 SSH animals. The genetic contribution of six main founder populations were computed for each SSH: the Spanish Purebreed (SPB), Arab Horse (A), Thoroughbred (TB), Selle Français (SF), German breeds (G) and North(-west) European (N) breeds. For this analysis we used BLUP (best linear unbiased predictor) animal models for five defined traits and for the total score. The genetic contribution as linear and quadratic adjustment and the interaction between genetic contributions were included as covariates in the genetic model to separate the possible combining ability from the breeding values. The optimal breed genetic contribution for each trait was maximised by using a simplex method. The best combination for conformation was 51% SPB and 49% N, for cross-country aptitude 23% SPB and 77% N, for dressage 48% SF and 52% N, and for show jumping 64% A and 36% N. For cross-country the best performance was predicted using 100% N genetic contribution and for the total score of 24% SF and 76% N. The combination of two breeds (group of breeds) seemed to be the best option for most of the traits. Although the results should be interpreted with caution, the importance of this paper is that it can be considered as a starting point of the analysis. The methodology applied here performed nicely in searching for the best contribution of several breeds to find the best combination for particular interests and could, therefore, be useful for other species/populations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aThoroughbred 3aanimal models 3abreeding value 3acrossbreds 3ahorses 3ajumping 3aphenotype 3asports 0acomplementarity 0acomposite breeds 0aequine 0asport competition1 aBartolomé, E.1 aValera, M.1 aGutiérrez, J.

RESULTS: Chitooligosaccharides, at 0.001–0.01%, inhibited the formation of staling compounds in forced aged beer. The formation of 5-hydroxymethylfurfural, trans-2-nonenal and phenylacetaldehyde were decreased by 105, 360 and 27%, respectively, when compared with those in stale beer without chitooligosaccharide addition. The capability of chitooligosaccharides to prevent staling compound formation depended on their molecular size (2 or 3 kDa). The DPPH/hydroxyl radical scavenging activity in fresh beer significantly lower than that in forced aged beer in the presence of chitooligosaccharides. When compared with stale beer without added chitooligosaccharides, the radical scavenging activity could be increased by adding chitooligosaccharides to forced aged beer. CONCLUSIONS: Chitooligosaccharides play an active part in the prevention of beer flavour deterioration by inhibiting the formation of staling compounds and increasing radical scavenging activity.  aPublisher supplied data  a31371742cNational Nature Science Foundation of China  a2015GA650004cNational Spark Program 3a2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl 3aantioxidant activity 3abeers 3achitooligosaccharides 3aflavor 3afree radicals 3ahydroxyl radicals 3ahydroxymethylfurfural 3amolecular weight 3aphenylacetaldehyde1 aLuan, Bo1 aSun, Zhen1 aYang, Chao1 aYu, Zhimin1 aLi, Xianzhen1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0191-94840 tBiotechnology letters.g2017 Feb., v. 39, no. 2 p.305-310dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl31090x0141-54927nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10529-016-2248-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02813naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100001700137245008600154300001800240520162000258592002801878650001601906650001101922650001701933650001801950650001601968650001301984650002101997650001102018650001002029650001202039650000902051653001602060653001102076653001302087653001102100653000902111653001202120653000902132700002102141700001502162773009802177856007102275852000902346655001202355IND60536785220221117232300.0160806s2016    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053678522DNAL7 a10.1071/AN147712doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPratt, Chris12aA promising and simple method to quantify soil/manure mixing on beef feedlot pens  ap. 1361-1366.  aOn beef cattle feed pen surfaces, fresh and decayed manure is mixed with base rock or soil (base). Quantifying this mixing has beneficial applications for aspects including nutrient and greenhouse gas budgeting. However, no practical methods exist to quantify mixing. We investigated if measuring element concentrations in: (A) fresh manure, (B) base material, and (C) pen manure offers a promising method to quantify manure/base mixing on pen surfaces. Using three operational beef feedlots as study sites, we targeted carbon (C), and silicon (Si), which are the two most abundant and easily measurable organic and inorganic elements. Our results revealed that C concentrations were strongly (>15 times) and significantly (P < 0.05) higher whereas Si concentrations strongly (>10 times) and significantly (P < 0.01) lower in fresh manure than base material at all three sites. These relative concentrations were not significantly impacted by manure decay, as determined by an 18-week incubation experiment. This suggested that both of these elements are suitable markers for quantifying base/manure mixing on pens. However, due to the chemical change of manure during decay, C was shown to be an imprecise marker of base/manure mixing. By contrast, using Si to estimate base/manure mixing was largely unaffected by manure decay. These findings were confirmed by measuring C and Si concentrations in stockpiled pen surface manure from one of the sites. Using Si concentrations is a promising approach to quantify base/manure mixing on feed pens given that this element is abundantly concentrated in soils and rocks.  aPublisher supplied data 3abeef cattle 3acarbon 3acattle feeds 3acattle manure 3afeed mixing 3afeedlots 3agreenhouse gases 3amixing 3arocks 3asilicon 3asoil 0abeef cattle 0acarbon 0afeedlots 0amanure 0arock 0asilicon 0asoil1 aRedding, Matthew1 aHill, Jaye0 tAnimal production science.g2016, v. 56, no. 9 p.1361-1366dCSIRO Publishingx1836-09397nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1071/AN147713Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02332naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245008500169300001600254520107700270592002801347596006201375650002601437650001401463650002201477650003201499650001101531650001901542650004401561650001501605650001401620650001701634650001601651700001701667700002201684700001801706773011901724856008201843852000901925655001201934IND60574101420221116152045.0220819e201702  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057410142DNAL7 a10.1007/s10529-016-2246-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSaik, Amy Yi Hsan10aEnzymatic synthesis of quercetin oleate esters using Candida antarctica lipase B  ap. 297-304.  aOBJECTIVES: To investigate the lipase-catalyzed acylation of quercetin with oleic acid using Candida antarctica lipase B. RESULTS: Three acylated analogues were produced: quercetin 4′-oleate (C₃₃H₄₂O₈), quercetin 3′,4′-dioleate (C₅₁H₇₄O₉) and quercetin 7,3′,4′-trioleate (C₆₉H₁₀₆O₁₀). Their identities were confirmed with UPLC–ESI–MS and ¹H NMR analyses. The effects of temperature, duration and molar ratio of substrates on the bioconversion yields varied across conditions. The regioselectivity of the acylated quercetin analogues was affected by the molar ratio of substrates. TLC showed the acylated analogues had higher lipophilicity (152% increase) compared to quercetin. Partition coefficient (log P) of quercetin 4′-oleate was higher than those of quercetin and oleic acid. Quercetin 4′-oleate was also stable over 28 days of storage. CONCLUSIONS: Quercetin oleate esters with enhanced lipophilicity can be produced via lipase-catalyzed reaction using C. antarctica lipase B to be used in topical applications.  aPublisher supplied data  a02-02-10-SF0072cKementerian Sains, Teknologi dan Inovasi 3aPseudozyma antarctica 3aacylation 3abiotransformation 3acarboxylic ester hydrolases 3aesters 3ahydrophobicity 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aoleic acid 3aquercetin 3astorage time 3atemperature1 aLim, Yau Yan1 aStanslas, Johnson1 aChoo, Wee Sim0 tBiotechnology letters.g2017 Feb., v. 39, no. 2 p.297-304dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl31090x0141-54927nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10529-016-2246-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02584naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245011800164300001600282520138700298592002801685650001501713650001201728650001501740650001401755650001201769650002301781650002001804650001501824650001101839650001401850650001501864651001601879651002801895700001801923700001501941700001601956773011201972856008102084852000902165655001202174IND60439276120221120105348.0160903e200808  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6043927612DNAL7 a10.1007/s10344-007-0156-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHebeisen, C.10aEstimating wild boar (Sus scrofa) abundance and density using capture–resights in Canton of Geneva, Switzerland  ap. 391-401.  aWe estimated wild boar abundance and density using capture–resight methods in the western part of the Canton of Geneva (Switzerland) in the early summer from 2004 to 2006. Ear-tag numbers and transmitter frequencies enabled us to identify individuals during each of the counting sessions. We used resights generated by self-triggered camera traps as recaptures. Program Noremark provided Minta–Mangel and Bowden’s estimators to assess the size of the marked population. The minimum numbers of wild boars belonging to the unmarked population (juveniles and/or piglets) were added to the respective estimates to assess total population size. Over the 3 years, both estimators showed a stable population with a slight diminishing tendency. We used mean home range size determined by telemetry to assess the sampled areas and densities. Mean wild boar population densities calculated were 10.6 individuals/km² ± 0.8 standard deviation (SD) and 10.0 ind/km² ± 0.6 SD with both estimators, respectively, and are among the highest reported from Western Europe. Because of the low proportion of marked animals and, to a lesser extent, of technical failures, our estimates showed poor precision, although they displayed similar population trends compared to the culling bag statistics. Reported densities were consistent with the ecological conditions of the study area.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSus scrofa 3acameras 3ahome range 3ajuveniles 3apiglets 3apopulation density 3apopulation size 3astatistics 3asummer 3atelemetry 3awild boars 3aSwitzerland 3aWestern European region1 aFattebert, J.1 aBaubet, E.1 aFischer, C.0 tEuropean journal of wildlife research.g2008 Aug., v. 54, no. 3 p.391-401dSpringer-Verlagx1612-46427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10344-007-0156-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02436naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100003000152245012700182520124400309592002801553650002501581650002401606650001701630650001501647650001001662650002001672650001401692650003301706653001301739653002001752653002501772653002201797700002801819700001601847773010301863856008701966852000902053655001202062IND60764000820221118102626.0220314e202204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076400082DNAL7 a10.1016/j.colsurfb.2022.1123522doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVillalva, Denise Gradella10aCharacterization of cubosomes immobilized in hydrogels of hyaluronic acid and their use for diclofenac controlled delivery  aCubosomes are dispersions of bicontinuous surfactant phases that constitute an assertive option to carry and release drugs and biomolecules, offering high efficiency of entrapment and specificity towards biological targets. This paper reports, for the first time to the best of our knowledge, the immobilization and characterization of cubosomes in chemically cross-linked oxi-hyaluronic acid and the evaluation of their use for controlled delivery of diclofenac, which is chosen as a model drug. Immobilized cubosomes prepared with phytantriol and bearing either negative or positive charges (in this case due to the addition of a cationic surfactant) were characterized by small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) analysis and high-resolution confocal microscopy, confirming that their internal structure remains unaltered and that they appear uniformly distributed within the hydrogel matrix. Their release properties were assessed, and a limited leaching of the cubosomes from the hydrogel matrix with sustained release of the entrapped diclofenac was confirmed. These results enable the use of immobilized cubosomes as an attractive platform for biomedical applications, significantly extending the already promising features of cubosomes.  aPublisher supplied data 3acationic surfactants 3aconfocal microscopy 3acrosslinking 3adiclofenac 3adrugs 3ahyaluronic acid 3ahydrogels 3asmall-angle X-ray scattering 0aCubosome 0aHyaluronic acid 0aImmobilized cubosome 0aSodium diclofenac1 aFrança, Carla Giometti1 aLoh, Watson0 tColloids and surfaces.g2022 Apr., v. 212 p.112352-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11946x0927-77657nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfb.2022.1123523Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03200naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245009700166300001600263520177400279592002802053650002002081650002502101650002202126650001002148650002302158650002202181650000902203650001602212650001102228650002202239650001302261650001502274650001502289650001202304650002202316650001502338650001302353650001002366650001102376650002002387650001602407650001302423650001102436651001102447700002202458773011202480856008102592852000902673655001202682IND60439276320221120105425.0160903e200808  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6043927632DNAL7 a10.1007/s10344-008-0171-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMysterud, Atle14aThe effect of domestic sheep on forage plants of wild reindeer; a landscape scale experiment  ap. 461-468.  aDomestic herbivores often compete with wildlife for limited resources, and on longer time-scales, grazing may also increase or decrease coverage of important food plants to wildlife affecting the threshold density for when competition can be expected. In Norway, there are growing concerns about the effect of releasing 2.1 million domestic sheep (Ovis aries) for summer grazing into areas hosting wild populations of alpine reindeer (Rangifer tarandus). We quantified the effect of sheep grazing (0, 25 and 80 sheep/km²) on the development in coverage and abundance of plants known to be important in the diet of reindeer during summer (vascular plants) and winter (lichens) within a fully replicated, landscape scale (2.7 km²) experiment. From 2001 to 2005, the sedge, Carex bigelowii, increased while the herb Solidago virgaurea decreased in frequency at high density of sheep relative to controls (both marginally non-significant). There was no marked development in Deschampsia flexuosa, Salix herbacea or Hierarcium alpinum that could be related to sheep grazing intensity. Lichen coverage and height both decreased at high density of sheep from 2002 to 2005. Effects of low grazing intensity were closer to controls than to high grazing intensity. Our study highlights that high sheep grazing intensity induce changes to the plant community that, at the same time, can improve the summer habitat and detriment the winter habitat to reindeer. Many wild reindeer populations are fragmented and may thus be limited by either summer or winter range. The effect of sheep grazing is predicted to vary accordingly. However, currently, we have limited ability to quantify how much this explicitly means in terms of increased or reduced carrying capacity for reindeer.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCarex bigelowii 3aDeschampsia flexuosa 3aRangifer tarandus 3aSalix 3aSolidago virgaurea 3acarrying capacity 3adiet 3afood plants 3aforage 3agrazing intensity 3ahabitats 3aherbivores 3alandscapes 3alichens 3aplant communities 3apopulation 3areindeer 3asheep 3asummer 3avascular plants 3awild plants 3awildlife 3awinter 3aNorway1 aAustrheim, Gunnar0 tEuropean journal of wildlife research.g2008 Aug., v. 54, no. 3 p.461-468dSpringer-Verlagx1612-46427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10344-008-0171-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02158naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001500147245008500162300001600247520094900263592002801212596009801240650001401338650001801352650001601370650001701386650001101403650001301414650002501427650001301452650001301465650004301478650001201521700001501533700001401548773011901562856008201681852000901763655001201772IND60574102020221116151901.0220819e201702  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057410202DNAL7 a10.1007/s10529-016-2253-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Hai10aSTARD13 promotes hepatocellular carcinoma apoptosis by acting as a ceRNA for Fas  ap. 207-217.  aOBJECTIVES: To study the roles of STARD13 in cellular apoptosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). RESULTS: Quantitative real-time PCR and immunohistochemistry analyses showed that the expression levels of STARD13 and Fas were lower in clinical HCC tissues than in normal tissues and were positively correlated, which is consistent with the results analyzed by The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) data. Patients with higher STARD13 or Fas expression levels had longer overall survival. Additionally, STARD13 3′-UTR enhanced cellular apoptosis and the 3′-UTRs of STARD13 and Fas were predicted to harbor nine similar miRNA binding sites. And STARD13 3′-UTR promoted Fas expression in a 3′-UTR- and miRNA-dependent way and increased the sensitivity of HCC cells to chemotherapy. Importantly, the coding sequence of STARD13 did not increase Fas expression. CONCLUSIONS: STARD13 3′-UTR promotes HCC apoptosis through acting as a ceRNA for Fas.  aPublisher supplied data  aJX6C-48cthe Scientific Research Building Projects of the Health Department of Hubei province 3aapoptosis 3abinding sites 3acorrelation 3adrug therapy 3agenome 3ahepatoma 3aimmunohistochemistry 3amicroRNA 3apatients 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3atissues1 aWang, Fang1 aHu, Yahua0 tBiotechnology letters.g2017 Feb., v. 39, no. 2 p.207-217dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl31090x0141-54927nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10529-016-2253-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02531naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001700140245011100157300002000268520138800288592002801676650001601704650001101720650001201731650001401743650002201757650001001779650000701789650001801796650001101814700001801825700001401843700001801857700001801875700001601893700001701909773012401926856007402050852000902124655001202133IND60667440520221122201011.0190919e20150427xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066744052DNAL7 a10.1039/c5ra03307a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNing, Xun'an10aDegradation of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in textile dyeing sludge by O₃/H₂O₂ treatment  ap. 38021-38029.  aThe degradation of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in textile dyeing sludge by O₃/H₂O₂ treatment was investigated. Fluorene (Fl), phenanthrene (Ph), anthracene (An) and dibenz[a,h]anthracene (DBA) were selected to represent typical PAHs. The effect of radical inhibitors, H₂O₂, O₃ flow rate, pH and reaction time on the degradation of the four types of PAHs were examined to determine the optimal conditions for degradation and to clarify the mechanism(s) of PAHs degradation. The results indicated that the combined O₃/H₂O₂ treatment resulted in high removal rates of the selected PAHs: 89% for Fl, 66% for Ph, 71% for An and 81% for DBA. These results correspond to the optimal conditions of an O₃ flow rate of 0.4 L min⁻¹, a H₂O₂ concentration of 0.60 mol L⁻¹, a reaction time of 15 min and pH 7. The removal rate (within 30 min) increased by 5% for Fl, 27% for Ph, 21% for An and 5% for DBA through the addition of H₂O₂ to the O₃ process. The O₃ flow rate, reaction time and pH were the key parameters affecting PAH degradation with multiple interacting factors (p < 0.05) by the O₃/H₂O₂ treatment. The degradation of the PAHs can be fitted well by pseudo-first-order kinetics (R² = 0.9656). The combined O₃/H₂O₂ treatment is demonstrated to be an efficient approach for the degradation of PAHs in textile dyeing sludge.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanthracenes 3adyeing 3afabrics 3afluorenes 3ahydrogen peroxide 3aozone 3apH 3aphenanthrenes 3asludge1 aShen, Lingzhi1 aSun, Jian1 aLin, Chaoping1 aZhang, Yaping1 aYang, Zuoyi1 aChen, Shujun0 tRSC advances.g2015 Apr. 27, v. 5, no. 48 p.38021-38029dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c5ra03307a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03600naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100005800139245013500197300001600332500001100348520190100359592002802260596005902288596011502347650001702462650001702479650001802496650002202514650001802536650001702554650002002571650001002591650003002601650002502631650001602656650001402672651001402686651001802700700005902718700006002777700001602837700001602853700005602869773011002925856007403035852000903109655001203118IND60793524420221119013418.0220917e202210  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079352442DNAL7 a10.1111/cla.125032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShen, Rongrong1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6721-435910aUnraveling the evolutionary history of the snakefly family Inocelliidae (Insecta: Raphidioptera) through integrative phylogenetics  ap. 515-537.  aREVIEW  aInocelliidae is one of the two extant families of the holometabolan order Raphidioptera (snakeflies), with the modern fauna represented by seven genera and 44 species. The evolutionary history of the family is little‐known. Here we present the first phylogenetic and biogeographical analyses based on a worldwide sampling of taxa and datasets combined with morphological characters and mitochondrial genomes, aiming to investigate the intergeneric phylogeny and historical biogeography of Inocelliidae. The phylogenetic inference from the combined analysis of morphological and molecular data recovered the sister‐group relationship between a clade of (Negha + Indianoinocellia) + Sininocellia and a clade of Fibla + the Inocellia clade (interiorly nested by Amurinocellia and Parainocellia). Amurinocellia stat.r. and Parainocellia stat.r. et emend.n. are relegated to subgeneric status within Inocellia, whereas a newly erected subgenus of Inocellia, Epinocellia subgen.n., accommodates the former Parainocellia burmana (U. Aspöck and H. Aspöck, 1968) plus a new species Inocellia (Epinocellia) weii sp.n. Further, the Inocellia crassicornis group constitutes the nominotypical subgenus Inocellia stat.n., but the Inocellia fulvostigmata group is paraphyletic. Diversification within Inocelliidae is distinguished by an Eocene divergence leading to extant genera and a Miocene radiation of species. A biogeographical scenario depicts how the diverse inocelliid fauna from East Asia could have originated from western North America via dispersal across the Beringia during the early Tertiary, and how the Miocene ancestors of Inocellia could have accomplished long‐distance dispersals via the Tibet–Himalayan corridor or eastern Palaearctic to western Palaearctic. Our results shed new light specifically on the evolution of Inocelliidae and, in general, the Raphidioptera.  aPublisher supplied data  a31672322cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a2019HJ2096001006cBiodiversity Survey and Assessment Project of the Ministry of Ecology and Environment, China 3aEocene epoch 3aInocelliidae 3aMiocene epoch 3aPalearctic region 3aRaphidioptera 3abiogeography 3adata collection 3afauna 3ageographical distribution 3amitochondrial genome 3anew species 3aparaphyly 3aEast Asia 3aNorth America1 aAspöck, Horst,1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9407-35661 aAspöck, Ulrike,1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1912-26091 aPlant, John1 aDai, Yuting1 aLiu, Xingyue1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9168-06590 tCladistics.g2022 Oct., v. 38, no. 5 p.515-537dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl39879x0748-30077nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/cla.125033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03767naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245011500170506010400285506007600389520178000465592002802245506003702273650001802310650001902328650001502347650001402362650001702376650001502393650001402408650001202422650002002434650000902454650001602463650001902479650001102498650001302509650001702522650001602539653002502555653002202580653002302602653002602625653001502651700002302666700002202689700001902711700002102730700002302751700002202774700002402796700001902820700002302839700002102862700002402883700002402907773010402931856008503035852000903120655001203129IND60764001420221207140529.0220523e202205  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076400142DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apsoil.2022.1043882doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aQuinn, Gerry A.10aComplementary protein extraction methods increase the identification of the Park Grass Experiment metaproteome  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aAlthough the Park Grass Experiment is an important international reference soil for temperate grasslands, it still lacks the direct extraction of its metaproteome. The identification of these proteins can be crucial to our understanding of soil ecology and major biogeochemical processes. However, the extraction of protein from soil is a technically fraught process due to difficulties with co-extraction of humic material and lack of compatible databases to identify proteins. To address these issues, we combined two protein extraction techniques on Park Grass experiment soil, one based on humic acid removal, namely a modified freeze-dry, heat/thaw/phenol/chloroform (HTPC) method and another which co-extracts humic material, namely an established surfactant method. A broad range of proteins were identified by matching the mass spectra of extracted soil proteins against a tailored Park Grass proteome database. These were mainly in the categories of “protein metabolism”, “membrane transport”, “carbohydrate metabolism”, “respiration” “ribosomal and nitrogen cycle” proteins, enabling reconstitution of specific processes in grassland soil. Protein annotation using NCBI and EBI databases inferred that the Park Grass soil is dominated by Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, Acidobacteria and Firmicutes at phylum level and Bradyrhizobium, Rhizobium, Acidobacteria, Streptomyces and Pseudolabrys at genus level. Further functional enrichment analysis enabled us to connect protein identities to regulatory and signalling networks of key biogeochemical cycles, notably the nitrogen cycle. The newly identified Park Grass metaproteome thus provides a baseline on which future targeted studies of important soil processes and their control can be built.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aAcidobacteria 3aBradyrhizobium 3aFirmicutes 3aRhizobium 3aStreptomyces 3achloroform 3adatabases 3agrasses 3agrassland soils 3aheat 3ahumic acids 3anitrogen cycle 3aphenol 3aproteome 3asoil ecology 3asurfactants 0aTemperate-grasslands 0aSoil-Metaproteome 0aProtein-extraction 0aBiogeochemical-cycles 0aRegulation1 aAbdelhameed, Alyaa1 aBanat, Ibrahim M.1 aBerrar, Daniel1 aDoerr, Stefan H.1 aDudley, Edward J.,1 aFrancis, Lewis W.1 aGazze, Salvatore A.1 aHallin, Ingrid1 aMatthews, G.

Developing effective vaccines against ETEC associated diarrhea becomes a top priority. ETEC heat-labile toxin (LT) and heat-stable toxin (STa) toxoid fusion 3xSTaN12S-dmLT was demonstrated recently to induce neutralizing antitoxin antibodies in intraperitoneally or subcutaneously immunized mice. However, whether antibodies derived from this toxoid fusion are protective against ETEC diarrhea has not been examined. In this study, we intramuscularly immunized pregnant gilts with toxoid fusion 3xSTaN12S-dmLT, challenged suckling piglets with a STa-positive ETEC strain, and assessed protective efficacy of passive acquire antitoxin antibodies against ETEC diarrhea. Data showed all three immunized gilts developed anti-STa IgG and IgA antibodies, and piglets born to the immunized dams acquired anti-STa and anti-LT antibodies. When challenged with a STa+ ETEC strain, none of the piglets born to the immunized dams developed watery diarrhea, with 20 piglets remained normal and the other 8 piglets developed mild diarrhea indicated with stained butt. In contrast, the control dams and born piglets had no anti-STa or anti-LT antibodies detected, and 26 out 32 piglets developed watery diarrhea after challenge of the STa+ ETEC strain. These results indicated that passive acquired anti-STa antibodies are protective against ETEC diarrhea, and suggested potential application of toxoid fusion 3xSTaN12S-dmLT in ETEC vaccine development.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aantibodies 3aantitoxins 3achildren 3adiarrhea 3aenterotoxigenic Escherichia coli 3agilts 3aheat stability 3aimmunoglobulin A 3aimmunoglobulin G 3amice 3amodels 3aneutralization 3apiglets 3asuckling 3avaccine development 3avaccines 0aToxoid fusion 0a3xSTaN12S-dmLT 0aEnterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) 0aDiarrhea 0aVaccine 0aPig challenge model1 aDuan, Qiangde1 aWang, Yin1 aZhang, Weiping0 tVaccine.g2017 Jan. 23, v. 35, no. 4 p.552-556dElsevier LtdwJournal:6210x0264-410X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2016.12.0213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02855naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245012000166300001600286520127800302592002801580650001501608650001301623650002001636650001001656650001601666650003201682650001801714650001201732650002001744650005201764650001801816650001001834700001401844700001801858700001401876700001801890700002101908700001801929700001701947700001701964700001701981700001801998700001802016700001602034700001902050700001602069700001802085773011902103856008202222852000902304655001202313IND60574102220221116152013.0220819e201702  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057410222DNAL7 a10.1007/s10529-016-2249-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Yu-Chen14aThe developmental competence of oocytes parthenogenetically activated by an electric pulse and anisomycin treatment  ap. 189-196.  aOBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate the developmental competence of oocytes parthenogenetically activated by an electric pulse (EP) and treated with anisomycin and to determine whether this method is applicable to somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT). RESULTS: Embryos derived from porcine oocytes parthenogenetically activated by an EP and treatment with 0.01 µg/mL anisomycin had a significantly improved in vitro developmental capacity. Furthermore, 66.6% of blastocysts derived from these embryos had a diploid karyotype. The blastocyst formation rate of cloned embryos was similar between oocytes activated by an EP and treated with 2 mM 6-dimethylaminopurine for 4 h and those activated by an EP and treated with 0.01 µg/mL anisomycin for 4 h. The level of maturation-promoting factor was significantly decreased in oocytes activated by an EP and treated with anisomycin. Finally, the mRNA expression levels of apoptosis-related genes (Bax and Bcl-2) and pluripotency-related genes (Oct4, Nanog, and Sox2) were checked by RT-PCR. CONCLUSION: Our results demonstrate that porcine oocyte activation via an EP in combination with anisomycin treatment can lead to a high blastocyst formation rate in parthenogenetic activation and SCNT experiments.  aPublisher supplied data 3ablastocyst 3adiploidy 3agene expression 3agenes 3akaryotyping 3amaturation-promoting factor 3amessenger RNA 3aoocytes 3aparthenogenesis 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3asomatic cells 3aswine1 aJin, Long1 aZhu, Hai-Ying1 aGuo, Qing1 aLi, Xiao-Chen1 aZhang, Guang-Lei1 aXing, Xiao-Xu1 aXuan, Mei-Fu1 aLuo, Qi-Rong1 aLuo, Zhao-Bo1 aWang, Jun-Xia1 aCui, Cheng-Du1 aLi, Wen-Xue1 aCui, Zheng-Yun1 aYin, Xi-Jun1 aKang, Jin-Dan0 tBiotechnology letters.g2017 Feb., v. 39, no. 2 p.189-196dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl31090x0141-54927nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10529-016-2249-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02597naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002700164245007500191300001600266520083900282592002801121650001501149650001301164650001901177650001101196650002001207650002801227650001501255650001501270650002201285650001201307650001601319650002501335650002701360650003201387650002101419650003701440650003801477650002701515650004001542650004601582650002501628650004101653700002901694700003401723700003501757700002901792700003601821773012901857856004801986852000902034655001202043IND4474530620221119092148.0120727e201112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447453062DNAL7 a219846622pmid7 a10.1007/s00128-011-0397-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRossi, Stéfani Cibele10aSublethal Effects of Waterborne Herbicides in Tropical Freshwater Fish  ap. 603-607.  aThe study evaluated the sublethal effects of the herbicides glyphosate (Roundup) and diuron (Hexaron) and the mixture of them, used extremely in agriculture, through biomarkers in fish. The glutathione S-transferase activity increased (74%) and catalase activity decreased (37%) at the higher exposure concentration of Hexaron in comparison to the control group, suggesting an activation of this metabolism route. Membrane damage was observed at the higher exposure of Roundup and in the mixture group compared to the control group, which can be related to the nuclear alterations observed in these exposed groups.

The aim of this study was to evaluate if trace element concentrations in soils chronically exposed to industrial and agricultural activities did affect the soil microbial community, in terms of biomass, activity and diversity. Soil samples differing in trace elements (As, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Ni, Pb, V, Zn) concentrations were analysed for the total microbial biomass (Cₘᵢc), fungal mycelium, microbial activity, indexes of microbial community structure (fungal percentage of total Cₘᵢc) and microbial metabolism (metabolic quotient or qCO₂; carbon mineralization rate or CMR), and genetic bacterial diversity (richness, Shannon index and evenness of bacterial groups). Relationships of the microbial variables with individual trace element concentrations, relative Overall Contamination Index (OCI), and ordinary soil properties (pH, water content, organic C content, electrical conductivity) were assessed by simple and multivariate statistical analysis. Neither OCI nor single element concentrations determined a significant reduction in soil microbial biomass, activity and diversity, these variables being mainly driven by soil organic C and water content. Only soil Cr concentration affected indexes of the microbial metabolism and structure, without causing stressful conditions. Even Cₘᵢc and bacterial diversity showed higher values in soils richer of Cr. The results suggest that the concentrations of considered trace elements measured in our soils, or probably their bioavailable fractions, did not cause toxic effects on the microbial community. However, the chronic exposure to different patterns of trace element contamination probably elicited site-specific adaptive responses in microbial populations.  aPublisher supplied data 3abioavailability 3achronic exposure 3acommunity structure 3aecosystems 3aelectrical conductivity 3afungi 3ametabolism 3amicrobial activity 3amicrobial biomass 3amicrobial communities 3amineralization 3amultivariate analysis 3amycelium 3apH 3asoil ecology 3asoil microorganisms 3asoil organic carbon 3atoxicity 3awater content 3aItaly 0aTrace elements 0aMicrobial biomass 0aMicrobial activity 0aBacterial genetic diversity 0aContamination factors 0aOverall contamination index1 aTrifuoggi, M.1 aRutigliano, F.A.0 tApplied soil ecology.g2022 June, v. 174 p.104392-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl55717x0929-13937nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apsoil.2022.1043923Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03593naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001600151245012600167520181900293592002802112650001802140650001802158650002202176650002502198650001502223650001302238650002502251650002002276650002602296650001802322650001402340650002502354650001902379650002102398650000902419650001102428650001802439650001102457650001702468650002202485653001502507653001802522653002602540653003002566653002602596700001702622700002002639700001702659700001702676700001302693700002002706700001102726700001702737700001602754773011402770856008602884852000902970655001202979IND60682378720221122051352.0200320e202004  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068237872DNAL7 a10.1016/j.indcrop.2020.1121582doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aQiao, Huiru10aEnzymic polypeptide antioxidant activity and inhibitory activity on α-glucosidase and α-amylase from Paeonia ostii cake  aAs a residue of oil processing, research about Paeonia ostii cake has not been reported. We used six enzymes to hydrolyze the Paeonia ostii cake and obtained six enzymatic polypeptides. The enzymatic polypeptide yields of the six methods were between 10.0 and 25.0 % and average molecular weight was between 3.0 and 10.0 kDa. The average particle size of six enzymatic polypeptides was less than 1000.0 nm. The enzymatic hydrolysis method had a significant effect on the surface morphology of the enzymatic residues. The enzymatic polypeptide from alkaline protease method had better thermal stability and stronger infrared absorption. The eight essential amino acid contents of six enzymatic polypeptides from pepsin, papain, neutral protease, protemax, trypsase and alkaline protease method were 14.7, 13.3, 14.2, 12.8, 13.8 and 15.0 %, and hydrophobic amino acid contents were 14.7, 14.2, 14.2, 13.9, 13.7 and 15.1 %, respectively. Among the 12 non-essential amino acids, only glutamine and asparagine were absent. In addition, the different amino acid increment in six enzymatic polypeptides was significantly different. Among them, cysteine had the largest increment, followed by glycine and glutamic acid. By 5-axe cobweb chart method, the enzymatic polypeptide from alkaline protease method was proved to have the strongest comprehensive antioxidant activity. The enzymatic polypeptides of alkaline protease and protemax method had stronger inhibition activity of α-glucosidase and α-amylase. In general, the enzymatic polypeptide from alkaline protease method had good antioxidant activity and physiological activity. Our research will provide basic data support for new potential applications of enzymatic polypeptide from peony cake and increase the added value of Paeonia ostii processing enterprises.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPaeonia ostii 3aalpha-amylase 3aalpha-glucosidase 3aantioxidant activity 3aasparagine 3acysteine 3aenzymatic hydrolysis 3aenzyme activity 3aessential amino acids 3aglutamic acid 3aglutamine 3aglycine (amino acid) 3ahydrophobicity 3amolecular weight 3aoils 3apapain 3aparticle size 3apepsin 3apolypeptides 3athermal stability 0aTree peony 0aP. ostii cake 0aEnzymatic polypeptide 0aα-glucosidase inhibition 0aα-amylase inhibition1 aBi, Xiaojuan1 aZhang, Yuanyuan1 aLiu, Mengran1 aZu, Shuchong1 aJia, Nan1 aJiang, Shougang1 aLu, Qi1 aZu, Yuangang1 aBao, Yihong0 tIndustrial crops and products.g2020 Apr., v. 146 p.112158-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl49222x0926-66907nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.indcrop.2020.1121583Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02948naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002400150245011000174520162700284592002801911650001901939650002301958650001201981650001301993650002202006650003102028650002302059650002202082650001502104650001702119650002402136650001202160650002002172653002202192653001402214653002302228653001002251653001302261653001202274700001802286773010402304856008502408852000902493655001202502IND60764001820221118102557.0220523e202205  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076400182DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apsoil.2022.1043932doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJílková, Veronika10aBiochar and compost amendments to a coarse-textured temperate agricultural soil lead to nutrient leaching  aOrganic soil amendments benefit agricultural soils depleted in soil organic matter because they improve soil chemical and biological properties. Biochar and compost, used as organic amendments, differ in their contents of total vs. available nutrients and may therefore differ in their effects on soil properties. The effects of these amendments have seldom been assessed in coarse-textured temperate soils and in no-tillage agriculture. In this study, we conducted a 6-month laboratory experiment with a coarse-textured temperate soil with a history of conventional farming to determine the effects of biochar, compost, and their combination, which were spread evenly on the soil surface, on microbial activity and biomass, and nutrient release and leaching. Both biochar and compost increased microbial activity and nutrient release compared to the no-addition treatment, but compost effects were relatively short term (<two months), and biochar effects were relatively long term (>six months). Biochar and compost had additive effects on all properties when added in combination. Biochar addition to soil increased soil pH, microbial biomass, and the abundance of fungi, G⁺ bacteria, and actinobacteria after 6 months of incubation compared to the compost treatment and the no-addition treatment. Although biochar was expected to reduce loss of nutrients through leaching, the short exposure time and disturbance of the soil probably hindered its capacity to adsorb nutrients and to thereby limit leaching; as a consequence, the biochar acted only as a slow-release nutrient fertilizer during the 6-month incubation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aActinobacteria 3aagricultural soils 3abiochar 3acomposts 3aexposure duration 3alaboratory experimentation 3amicrobial activity 3amicrobial biomass 3ano-tillage 3asoil ecology 3asoil organic matter 3asoil pH 3atemperate soils 0aOrganic amendment 0aMicrocosm 0aMicrobial activity 0afungi 0abacteria 0aSoil pH1 aAngst, Gerrit0 tApplied soil ecology.g2022 May, v. 173 p.104393-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl55717x0929-13937nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apsoil.2022.1043933Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03640naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002200151245010000173300001600273520197400289592002802263650002602291650001902317650001202336650001502348650001602363650002402379650001702403650002102420650001202441650002102453650001402474650001302488650001402501650001902515650001202534653001202546653002602558653002202584653002902606653002402635700006102659700001802720700002102738700002002759700001802779700002402797700002202821700001702843700002302860773009602883856008602979852000903065655001203074IND60561148620221120101559.0190319e20170123xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056114862DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vaccine.2016.12.0282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPehrson, Caroline10aComparison of functional assays used in the clinical development of a placental malaria vaccine  ap. 610-618.  aMalaria in pregnancy is associated with significant morbidity in pregnant women and their offspring.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the robustness and comparability of binding inhibition assays used in the clinical development of placental malaria vaccines.The ability of sera from animals immunised with different VAR2CSA constructs to inhibit IE binding to CSA was investigated in three in vitro assays using 96-well plates, petri dishes, capillary flow and an ex vivo placental perfusion assay.The inter-assay variation was not uniform between assays and ranged from above ten-fold in the flow assay to two-fold in the perfusion assay. The intra-assay variation was highest in the petri dish assay. A positive correlation between IE binding avidity and the level of binding after antibody inhibition in the petri dish assay indicate that high avidity IE binding is more difficult to inhibit. The highest binding inhibition sensitivity was found in the 96-well and petri dish assays compared to the flow and perfusion assays where binding inhibition required higher antibody titers.The inhibitory capacity of antibodies is not easily translated between assays and the high sensitivity of the 96-well and petri dish assays stresses the need for comparing serial dilutions of serum. Furthermore, IE binding avidity must be in the same range when comparing data from different days. There was an overall concordance in the capacity of antibody-mediated inhibition, when comparing the in vitro assays with the perfusion assay, which more closely represents in vivo conditions. Importantly the ID1-ID2a protein in a liposomal formulation, currently in a phase I trial, effectively induced antibodies that inhibited IE adhesion in placental tissue.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPlasmodium falciparum 3aanimal tissues 3aanimals 3aantibodies 3ablood serum 3achondroitin sulfate 3aerythrocytes 3ain vitro studies 3amalaria 3amalaria vaccines 3amorbidity 3aplacenta 3apregnancy 3apregnant women 3aprogeny 0aVAR2CSA 0aPlasmodium falciparum 0aPlacental malaria 0aBinding inhibition assay 0aVaccine development1 aHeno, Kristine K.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0625-23321 aAdams, Yvonne1 aResende, Mafalda1 aMathiesen, Line1 aSoegaard, Max1 ade Jongh, Willem A.1 aTheander, Thor G.1 aSalanti, Ali1 aNielsen, Morten A.0 tVaccine.g2017 Jan. 23, v. 35, no. 4 p.610-618dElsevier LtdwJournal:6210x0264-410X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2016.12.0283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02673naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245007500167300001200242520138900254592002801643650001001671650001301681650001701694650001901711650001101730650001501741650001001756650002501766650001501791650002201806650002001828650002001848651001201868651001001880651002101890700002101911700002101932700002001953700001901973700002101992773011202013856008102125852000902206655001202215IND60439277220221120093003.0160903e200808  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6043927722DNAL7 a10.1007/s10344-008-0175-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFickel, Jörns,10aCladogenesis of the European brown hare (Lepus europaeus Pallas, 1778)  ap. 495.  aA substantial portion of today’s biodiversity is attributed to the climatic oscillations of the Pleistocene Ice Ages. Gradual but dramatic climate changes were accompanied by expansion, contraction, and isolation of populations, promoting the accumulation of genome differences and adaptations in refugial populations and resulting in allopatric differentiation in a variety of taxa. In the present study, partial mitochondrial DNA sequences of the widely distributed European brown hare (Lepus europaeus) were analyzed to test whether the species’ present genetic structure is the result of postglacial re-colonization of Europe from Asia Minor (clade A) and the Balkans (clade B) only, as suggested previously, or if additional refugia are likely. Analyses indicated the presence of an additional refugium (Italy, clade I). The genealogic network of Italian hares displayed the tree-like structure expected from refugial populations, whereas central European brown hare haplotypes revealed a clear star-phylogeny indicative of past-bottleneck population growth. This population size expansion, which was confirmed by mismatch analysis, was estimated to have occurred ∼50–55 thousand years ago (kya). The divergence of clade A* from the remaining matrilines is estimated at 239 kya, whereas the divergence of the ancestors of clades B* and I from A* occurred about 128 kya.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLepus 3aancestry 3abiodiversity 3aclimate change 3agenome 3ahaplotypes 3ahares 3anucleotide sequences 3apopulation 3apopulation growth 3apopulation size 3arefuge habitats 3aBalkans 3aItaly 3aTurkey (country)1 aHauffe, Heidi C.1 aPecchioli, Elena1 aSoriguer, Ramon1 aVapa, Ljiljana1 aPitra, Christian0 tEuropean journal of wildlife research.g2008 Aug., v. 54, no. 3 p.495-495dSpringer-Verlagx1612-46427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10344-008-0175-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01191naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001600140245011900156300002000275520031100295592002800606650001600634650001400650650001300664650001500677700001400692773012400706856007400830852000900904655001200913IND60667441220221122132808.0190919e20150413xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066744122DNAL7 a10.1039/c5ra03322e2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShao, R.

Plant root secondary metabolism is correlated to its surrounding microbial communities. However, the root-associated microbiomes of P. cuspidatum and the potential correlation between the bioactive compounds and microbiomes are poorly understood. To unveil the root-associated bacterial community, the microbiome compositions of P. cuspidatum roots across four cultivation years were analyzed by using 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Furthermore, the relationships among root-associated bacteria, soil properties, and four major bioactive compounds (polydatin, resveratrol, emodin, and physcion) were explored by a multivariate correlation study. The composition of the rhizosphere microbiome significantly differed from that of the endosphere microbiome. The composition of the rhizosphere microbiome significantly varied across different cultivation years and soil properties, contributing to the majority of variance. Regarding different cultivation years and soil properties, the compositions of the root endosphere microbiome remained relatively stable, indicating a strong selection effect in P. cuspidatum roots. Among root endosphere microbes, Stenotrophomonas was specifically enriched from rhizosphere with a 15 times increase of relative abundance, exhibiting no significant variation across different cultivation years. The relative abundance of rhizosphere Stenotrophomonas was positively correlated with the content of emodin. Taken together, this study demonstrated that the stability of the root endosphere microbiome with a dominance of Stenotrophomonas may maintain the growth of P. cuspidatum through the combined effect of emodin. The contents of bioactive compounds in roots exhibited distinct correlations with specific bacteria, suggesting that Bacteroides, Acinetobacter, Erysipelatoclostridium, and Achromobacter may enhance the accumulation of resveratrol. This study provides insights into the interaction networks among P. cuspidatum root-associated bacteria, cultivation years, soil properties, and bioactive compounds, giving us a new opportunity to manipulate the production of bioactive compounds, and thus improve the industrial and medicinal value of P. cuspidatum in future.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAchromobacter 3aAcinetobacter 3aBacteroides 3aOriental traditional medicine 3aReynoutria japonica 3aStenotrophomonas 3abacteria 3abacterial communities 3abioactive compounds 3aemodin 3amedicinal plants 3ametabolism 3amicrobiome 3araw materials 3aresveratrol 3arhizosphere 3aribosomal RNA 3aroots 3asequence analysis 3asoil properties 3avariance 0aPolygonum cuspidatum 0aMedicinal plant 0aRoot-associated microbiome 0aCultivation year1 aZheng, Lanlan1 aZheng, Yan1 aXue, Shen1 aZhang, Jingxuan1 aHuang, Ping1 aZhao, Yongheng1 aHao, Xincai1 aHe, Zhikai1 aHu, Zhubing1 aZhou, Chao1 aChen, Qinhua1 aLiu, Jianping1 aWang, Guodong1 aSang, Ming1 aSun, Xiaodong1 aWang, Xuanbin1 aXiao, Xiao1 aLi, Chen1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0881-02060 tIndustrial crops and products.g2020 Mar., v. 145 p.112163-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl49222x0926-66907nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.indcrop.2020.1121633Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02185naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002300147245007500170300001600245520131900261592002801580650001601608650001401624650001201638650000901650650001201659700002201671773011201693856008101805852000901886655001201895IND60439277720221120093121.0160903e200808  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6043927772DNAL7 a10.1007/s10344-007-0165-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBubenik, George A.10aPalmated antlers of moose may serve as a parabolic reflector of sounds  ap. 533-535.  aIt has been postulated that the excellent sense of hearing in moose is mostly due to: (1) the large surface of the external ear, (2) better stereophony due to the large distance between ears, (3) independently movable, extremely adjustable pinna, and (4) the amplification of sounds reflected by the palms of the antlers. The last factor, possible reflection of sounds into pinna by the palm of the antlers, was tested in this study on a large antler trophy of Alaskan moose. The reception of a standard tone, broadcast from the frontally placed speaker, was recorded by a sound level meter located in an artificial moose ear. Three locations of the ear, as positioned relative to the speaker, e.g., frontward, sideward, and backward, were tested. The weakest reception was recorded in the backward position of the ear. If the sound pressure measured in the frontward position was set as 100%, the sound pressure in the backward position was 79%. The strongest reception was recorded when the artificial ear was positioned toward the center of the antler palm. In this position, the sound pressure was 119% relative to the frontward position. These findings strongly indicate that the palm of moose antlers may serve as an effective, parabolic reflector which increases the acoustic pressure of the incoming sound.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAlces alces 3aacoustics 3aantlers 3aears 3ahearing1 aBubenik, Peter G.0 tEuropean journal of wildlife research.g2008 Aug., v. 54, no. 3 p.533-535dSpringer-Verlagx1612-46427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10344-007-0165-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02443naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245008500167300001600252520142500268592002801693650001601721650001801737650001101755650001301766650001401779650001601793650001401809700001501823700001701838700002101855700002001876773010701896856008102003852000902084655001202093IND60574103320221116152046.0170725e201702  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057410332DNAL7 a10.1007/s10546-016-0196-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGiometto, M.

The proposed solution is valid for spatially-varying eddy viscosity and diffusivity (O’Brien type) and constant Prandtl number (Pr). Variations in the velocity and buoyancy profiles are discussed as a function of the dimensionless model parameters [Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text], where [Formula: see text] is the hydrodynamic roughness length, [Formula: see text] is the Brunt-Väisälä frequency, [Formula: see text] is the surface sloping angle, [Formula: see text] is the imposed surface buoyancy, and [Formula: see text] is a reference velocity scale used to define eddy diffusivities. Velocity and buoyancy profiles show significant variations in both phase and amplitude of extrema with respect to the classic constant [Formula: see text] model and with respect to a recent approximate analytic solution based on the Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin theory. Near-wall regions are characterized by relatively stronger surface momentum and buoyancy gradients, whose magnitude is proportional to [Formula: see text] and to [Formula: see text]. In addition, slope-parallel momentum and buoyancy fluxes are reduced, the low-level jet is further displaced toward the wall, and its peak velocity depends on both [Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text].  aPublisher supplied data 3adiffusivity 3ahydrodynamics 3amodels 3amomentum 3aroughness 3atroposphere 3aviscosity1 aGrandi, R.1 aFang, Joong,1 aMonkewitz, P.

We present a simple and robust technique for sex identification of red panda suitable for noninvasive studies based on sex-specific fragment size polymorphism in amelogenin (AMEL) gene. Sequence analysis of AMELX and AMELY revealed an 18-bp deletion in Y fragment which was used to differentially amplify 217 bp of X and 199 bp of Y fragments. The designed primer pair is very sensitive and exhibits polymerase chain reaction (PCR) success rates of 89 and 78 % at 0.1 and 0.01 ng template DNA concentrations, respectively. Further, we amplified poor quality faecal DNA with 94 % success rate and average dropout rate of 15.6 %. In silico analysis shows that these primers can also be used to identify sex of a sympatric species, giant panda.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAiluropoda melanoleuca 3aAilurus 3aDNA 3aexhibitions 3agenes 3apolymerase chain reaction 3asequence analysis 3asex determination analysis 3asympatry 3awild animals1 aRoka, Bhupen1 aRai, Upashna1 aReddy, P.

Autumn Gala (AGala), a somatic mutation from apple cultivar Gala, matures 4 weeks later than Gala. To understand the mechanisms underlying the delayed maturation, RNA‐seq analyses were conducted with fruit sampled at 13 (Gala) and 16 (AGala) time‐points during their growth and development. Weighted gene co‐expression network analysis (WGCNA) of 23 372 differentially expressed genes resulted in 25 WGCNA modules. Of these, modules 1 (r = −0.98, P = 2E‐21) and 2 (r = −0.52, P = 0.004), which were suppressed in AGala, were correlated with fruit maturation date. Surprisingly, 77 of the 152 member genes in module 1 were harbored in a 2.8‐Mb genomic region on chromosome 6 that was deleted and replaced by a 10.7‐kb gypsy‐like retrotransposon (Gy‐36) from chromosome 7 in AGala. Among the 77 member genes, MdACT7 was the most suppressed (by 10.5‐fold) in AGala due to a disruptive 2.5‐kb insertion in coding sequence. Moreover, MdACT7 is the exclusive apple counterpart of Arabidopsis ACT7 known of essential roles in plant development, and the functional allele MdACT7, which was lost to the deletion in AGala, was associated with early fruit maturation in 268 apple accessions. Overexpressing alleles MdACT7 and Mdact7 in an Arabidopsis act7 line showed that MdACT7 largely rescued its stunted growth and delayed initial flowering while Mdact7 did not. Therefore, the 2.8‐Mb hemizygous deletion is largely genetically causal for fruit maturation delay in AGala, and the total loss of MdACT7 might have contributed to the phenotype.  aPublisher supplied data  a2014‐67013‐21660cNational Institute of Food and Agriculture 3aArabidopsis 3aalleles 3aapples 3achromosomes 3acultivars 3afruit color 3afruits 3agene expression regulation 3agenomics 3agrowth and development 3aphenotype 3aplant development 3aretrotransposons 3asequence analysis 3asomatic mutation 3atrees1 aEl‐Sharkawy, Islam1 aZhao, Jiantao1 aFei, Zhangjun1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9684-14501 aXu, Kenong1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5254-53500 tplant journal.g2022 Sept., v. 111, no. 6 p.1609-1625dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl47643x0960-74127nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/tpj.159113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03278naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001900139245016700158300001800325500002000343520154500363592002801908596005901936650000801995650002602003650002302029650002202052650000802074650001402082650002402096650001002120650003502130650001402165650001502179650001502194650002202209650001202231650002602243650001102269700001602280700002102296700001502317700001802332700001602350700001502366700001602381700002102397700005202418700005402470773011702524856007402641852000902715655001202724IND60793525820221119013937.0220917e202209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079352582DNAL7 a10.1111/tpj.159222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Xiaoqing10aPhosphate (Pi) stress‐responsive transcription factors PdeWRKY6 and PdeWRKY65 regulate the expression of PdePHT1;9 to modulate tissue Pi concentration in poplar  ap. 1753-1767.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aPhosphorus (P) is an important nutrient for plants. Here, we identify a WRKY transcription factor (TF) in poplar (Populus deltoides × Populus euramericana) (PdeWRKY65) that modulates tissue phosphate (Pi) concentrations in poplar. PdeWRKY65 overexpression (OE) transgenic lines showed reduced shoot Pi concentrations under both low and normal Pi availabilities, while PdeWRKY65 reduced expression (RE) lines showed the opposite phenotype. A gene encoding a Pi transporter (PHT), PdePHT1;9, was identified as the direct downstream target of PdeWRKY65 by RNA sequencing (RNA‐Seq). The negative regulation of PdePHT1;9 expression by PdeWRKY65 was confirmed by DNA–protein interaction assays, including yeast one‐hybrid (Y1H), electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA), co‐expression of the promoters of PdePHT1;9 and PdeWRKY65 in tobacco (Nicotiana benthamiana) leaves, and chromatin immunoprecipitation–quantitative PCR. A second WRKY TF, PdeWRKY6, was subsequently identified and confirmed to positively regulate the expression of PdePHT1;9 by DNA–protein interaction assays. PdePHT1;9 and PdeWRKY6 OE and RE poplar transgenic lines were used to confirm their positive regulation of shoot Pi concentrations, under both normal and low Pi availabilities. No interaction between PdeWRKY6 and PdeWRKY65 was observed at the DNA or protein levels. Collectively, these data suggest that the low Pi‐responsive TFs PdeWRKY6 and PdeWRKY65 independently regulate the expression of PHT1;9 to modulate tissue Pi concentrations in poplar.  aPublisher supplied data  a32171745cNational Natural Science Foundation of China 3aDNA 3aNicotiana benthamiana 3aPopulus canadensis 3aPopulus deltoides 3aRNA 3achromatin 3agel electrophoresis 3agenes 3agenetically modified organisms 3aphenotype 3aphosphates 3aphosphorus 3asequence analysis 3atobacco 3atranscription factors 3ayeasts1 aZhang, Keai1 aNvsvrot, Tashbek1 aZhang, Yan1 aCai, Guanghua1 aHuang, Liyu1 aRen, Wenyu1 aDing, Yiwei1 aHammond, John P.1 aShi, Lei1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5312-85211 aWang, Nian1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9185-41990 tplant journal.g2022 Sept., v. 111, no. 6 p.1753-1767dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl47643x0960-74127nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/tpj.159223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02467naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100002100137245010200158300001600260500001500276520123900291592002801530650001501558650001101573650001401584650002601598650001501624650001501639650002401654650001001678650001101688650001801699650001401717650001501731650001301746650001501759653001401774653002701788653001501815700002301830773008801853856007101941852000902012655001202021IND60536787920221117232212.0160806s2016    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053678792DNAL7 a10.1071/RJ150192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKwok, Alan B.

Shrubs provide habitat for a range of arthropods, and variations within shrubland ecosystems may affect arthropod communities. We examined the role of shrub species and density in structuring arthropod communities in an encroached Australian woodland using two common and widespread shrub species, Turpentine (Eremophila sturtii) and Silver Cassia (Senna artemisioides subsp. filifolia). We found five times more arthropods (Psocoptera, Collembola and Hemiptera) on Eremophila compared with Senna. Furthermore, Psyllidae were found only on Eremophila. In total we recorded 39 Hemipteran species; 13 from Eremophila, 16 from Senna and 10 common to both shrub species. Each shrub species supported a unique arthropod assemblage, even though they grow in close proximity (<15m). In contrast, we found limited effects of fine-scale plant density, with plants growing in low and high density supporting similar arthropod communities. Our study indicated that isolated shrubs in these woodlands support a variety of arthropods, and shrub species is a more important driver of arthropod community structure than fine-scale density.  aPublisher supplied data 3ashrublands 3aCassia 3aPsyllidae 3aarthropod communities 3aCollembola 3aarthropods 3acommunity structure 3ahosts 3ashrubs 3aplant density 3awoodlands 3aecosystems 3ahabitats 3aturpentine 0aHemiptera 0aresource concentration 0aPsocoptera1 aEldridge, David J.0 tRangeland journal.g2016, v. 38, no. 4 p.381-389dCSIRO Publishingx1036-98727nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1071/RJ150193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03055naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245009300166300001100259520169600270592002801966650002301994650001102017650001702028650001302045650001702058650001902075650001502094650002302109650003202132650001502164650002202179650002902201650001502230650001702245650001102262650001402273650001802287700001402305700001402319700001602333700001502349773013102364856008102495852000902576655001202585IND60574103920221116152038.0170725e201702  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057410392DNAL7 a10.1007/s10661-017-5773-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEtchegoyen, MA10aOccurrence and fate of pesticides in the Argentine stretch of the Paraguay-Paraná basin  ap. 63.  aThe Argentine stretch of the del Plata basin crosses regions devoted to extensive and intensive agriculture mostly with chemical pest control. The utilization of pesticides in the region has increased 900% in the last two decades associated with the introduction of biotech crops and direct-seeding techniques. Our objective was to study the occurrence, concentration, and fate of pesticides in surface water and bottom sediments of the principal tributaries and main watercourse of the Paraguay-Paraná River. We sampled 22 sites in the distal positions of the main affluents and main watercourse of the Paraná and report here results from two monitoring campaigns (2010–2012). Surface water and bottom sediments were analyzed according to standardized methods by matrix-solid-phase dispersion and liquid-liquid extraction, respectively. Twenty-three pesticide compounds were analyzed by gas chromatography. The results from both campaigns indicated a generalized but variable distribution in the concentrations detected throughout the basin. The ranges of total measured pesticide concentrations in water and sediments were, respectively, 0.004–6.62 μg/l and 0.16–221.3 μg/kg dry weight. Endosulfans, cypermethrin, and chlorpyrifos were ubiquitous compounds in both environmental compartments and quantitatively the most relevant. All concentrations detected in water were over the recommended guidelines for the protection of aquatic biota. The partitioning indicated a higher affinity for the sediments. Agricultural activity is the source of pesticide-pollution loads, transported by tributaries that reach the main watercourse and alter the quality of the aquatic ecosystem.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaquatic ecosystems 3abasins 3achlorpyrifos 3acrossing 3acypermethrin 3adirect seeding 3aendosulfan 3agas chromatography 3agenetically modified plants 3aguidelines 3aintensive farming 3aliquid-liquid extraction 3amonitoring 3apest control 3arivers 3asediments 3asurface water1 aRonco, AE1 aAlmada, P1 aAbelando, M1 aMarino, DJ0 tEnvironmental monitoring and assessment.g2017 Feb., v. 189, no. 2 p.63-63dSpringer International Publishingx0167-63697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-017-5773-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03432naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100006500139245015000204300001800354500002000372520179700392592002802189596005102217650002002268650001102288650001402299650001402313650001802327650002502345650002402370650001502394650001602409650001302425650001302438650002602451650001502477650001402492700001902506700002502525700002102550700002102571700006002592700002202652700006402674773011702738856007402855852000902929655001202938IND60793526220221119014050.0220917e202209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079352622DNAL7 a10.1111/tpj.159132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNasr Esfahani, Maryam1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9314-481710aDifferential metabolic rearrangements in the roots and leaves of Cicer arietinum caused by single or double nitrate and/or phosphate deficiencies  ap. 1643-1659.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aNitrate (NO₃⁻) and phosphate (Pi) deficiencies are the major constraints for chickpea productivity, significantly impacting global food security. However, excessive fertilization is expensive and can also lead to environmental pollution. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop chickpea cultivars that are able to grow on soils deficient in both NO₃⁻ and Pi. This study focused on the identification of key NO₃⁻ and/or Pi starvation‐responsive metabolic pathways in the leaves and roots of chickpea grown under single and double nutrient deficiencies of NO₃⁻ and Pi, in comparison with nutrient‐sufficient conditions. A global metabolite analysis revealed organ‐specific differences in the metabolic adaptation to nutrient deficiencies. Moreover, we found stronger adaptive responses in the roots and leaves to any single than combined nutrient‐deficient stresses. For example, chickpea enhanced the allocation of carbon among nitrogen‐rich amino acids (AAs) and increased the production of organic acids in roots under NO₃⁻ deficiency, whereas this adaptive response was not found under double nutrient deficiency. Nitrogen remobilization through the transport of AAs from leaves to roots was greater under NO₃⁻ deficiency than double nutrient deficiency conditions. Glucose‐6‐phosphate and fructose‐6‐phosphate accumulated in the roots under single nutrient deficiencies, but not under double nutrient deficiency, and higher glycolytic pathway activities were observed in both roots and leaves under single nutrient deficiency than double nutrient deficiency. Hence, the simultaneous deficiency generated a unique profile of metabolic changes that could not be simply described as the result of the combined deficiencies of the two nutrients.  aPublisher supplied data  aJPJ009237cCabinet Office, Government of Japan 3aCicer arietinum 3acarbon 3achickpeas 3acultivars 3afood security 3afructose 6-phosphate 3aglucose 6-phosphate 3aglycolysis 3ametabolites 3anitrates 3anitrogen 3anutrient deficiencies 3aphosphates 3apollution1 aKusano, Miyako1 aAbdelrahman, Mostafa1 aNguyen, Kien Huu1 aWatanabe, Yasuko1 aMochida, Keiichi1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1299-00241 aBurritt, David J.1 aTran, Lam‐Son Phan1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9883-97680 tplant journal.g2022 Sept., v. 111, no. 6 p.1643-1659dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl47643x0960-74127nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/tpj.159133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04230naa a2200697 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024001700113024002100130024003100151024001100182040001800193100001800211245005400229300001600283506017300299520194800472650001502420650001402435650001602449650002002465650001402485650001802499650003302517650001702550650002002567650001202587650002202599650001402621650002402635650002202659650001702681650002502698650001402723650002102737650001202758650003602770650003202806650002102838650001102859650001802870650002402888650002202912650001402934650003402948700001702982700001902999700001703018700001703035700002103052700001703073773011903090856011203209856004403321956013703365961000903502852000903511655001203520IND50065056020221214230219.0130416e201302  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006505602DNAL7 a231482482pmid7 a2728412aris7 a10113/561142hdl7 a10.2527/jas.2012-53682doi8 ans1366  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAtkins, J.

Estrous cycles were synchronized in suckled beef cows and embryo donors were inseminated on d 0 (n = 810). Cows were classifi ed on d 0 as having a small (<12.5 mm) or large (≥12.5 mm) ovulatory follicle and randomly chosen as donors or recipients to remove confounding effects of ovulatory follicle size on fertility. Embryos (n = 393) or oocytes (n = 44) were recovered on d 7, and all viable embryos were transferred into recipients (n = 354). All statistical analyses were conducted using the GLM procedure of SAS. Path analysis (with significance set at P < 0.10) was used to examine potential cause–effect relationships among the measured variables. Greater donor cow BW, circulating estradiol concentration at insemination, postpartum interval, and ovulatory follicle size directly increased (P < 0.10) fertilization success. Greater donor cow age was the only factor that directly decreased (P < 0.10) fertilization success. Viability of d-7 embryos was directly inhibited (P < 0.10) by rapid follicular growth rate from d –2 to 0 and heavier BW. Direct beneficial effects to embryo viability were increased serum progesterone concentration on d –2 and ovulatory follicle size. Pregnancy maintenance from d 7 to 27 was enhanced (P < 0.10) by increased serum estradiol concentration on d 0 and progesterone concentration on d 7 in the recipient cow. Increased follicular diameter in the recipient cow on d 0 was detrimental to pregnancy maintenance from d 7 to 27.

The Central-European population is at present divided into small, isolated subpopulations, and Orawa (Carpathians, Poland-Slovakia) was considered until recently to be the most abundant one in the region. In 2002, it was estimated at 146–152 males. Surveys conducted in 2011–2014 showed that only 30–40 males were still present in this region. The total disappearance of leks (13 of 24 known leks have been abandoned) and the decline in overall numbers of males at existing leks (some leks were used by single males only) were recorded. In consequences, the number of lekking males decline by 76 % between 2002 and 2014. The nearest neighbour distance between active leks did not change, but the contraction of the total area used by the population (from 187.3 km² in 2002 to 71.5 km² in 2014) was recorded. The disappearance of leks was related to the size of the nearest peat bog; leks located close to small peat bogs were abandoned, while those located close to the larger ones remained active. Along with the decline in the numbers of lekking birds and the shrinkage of the range, a decrease in the size of wintering flocks was noted. This rapid fall over a short period of time in the number of black grouse and in the area used by the region’s largest population is indicative of a real threat of extinction of isolated populations. Rapid extinction risk should be taken into consideration when planning conservation measures applicable to its entire range of distribution.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLyrurus tetrix 3abirds 3aextinction 3aflocks 3alekking 3amales 3apeatlands 3aplanning 3arisk 3ashrinkage 3asurveys 3aEurope0 tEuropean journal of wildlife research.g2015 Aug., v. 61, no. 4 p.623-627dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx1612-46427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10344-015-0923-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03471naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094024002200133024001900155040001800174100002100192245011800213300001800331506007600349520195700425592002802382506003702410650001302447650002402460650001402484650001302498650001202511650000902523650000902532650001602541650001302557651001302570653001602583653001302599653002702612653001802639653001502657700002102672700001902693700002002712700002002732700002002752773009802772856008602870852000902956655001202965IND60561150020221207110519.0190319e20170215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056115002DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vaccine.2017.01.0132doi7 aPMC54057072pmcid7 a281082292pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWeinberg, Meghan10aVaccine shot-limiting: Estimating the prevalence, indicators, and impact on vaccination status — Michigan, 2012  ap. 1018-1023.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aConcerns regarding vaccine safety and pain have prompted certain parents to limit the number of shots their child receives per visit. We estimated the prevalence of shot-limited children in Michigan, described their characteristics, assessed whether shot-limited children were up-to-date on recommended vaccinations, and investigated possible intervention points for vaccination education.We analyzed vaccination registry and birth record data of children born in Michigan during 2012 who had ⩾2 vaccination visits, with ⩾1 visits after age 5months. Shot-limited was defined as receiving ⩽2 shots at all visits through age 24months. Nonlimited children received >2 shots at ⩾1 visits. Up-to-date vaccination was based on receipt of a seven-vaccine series and was determined at ages 24months and 35months. Risk ratios (RR) were calculated using risk regression.Of 101,443 children, a total of 2,967 (3%) children were shot-limited. Mothers of shot-limited children were more likely to be white (RR: 1.2; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.2–1.2), college graduate (RR: 1.9; 95% CI: 1.9–2.0), and married (RR: 1.5; 95% CI: 1.5–1.5). Compared with nonlimited children, shot-limited children were more likely to be born in a nonhospital setting (RR: 11.7; 95% CI: 9.4–14.6) and have a midwife attendant (RR: 1.9; 95% CI: 1.7–2.1). Shot-limited children were less likely to be up-to-date on recommended vaccinations (RR: 0.2; 95% CI: 0.2–0.3); this association was stronger for those with a midwife birth attendant (RR: 0.1; 95% CI: 0.1–0.2) rather than a medical doctor (RR: 0.3; 95% CI: 0.2–0.3).Shot-limited children are less likely to be up-to-date on vaccinations, possibly leading to increased risk for vaccine-preventable diseases. This association was stronger for those with a midwife birth attendant. This analysis should prompt targeted education, such as to midwives, concerning risks associated with shot-limiting behavior.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3achildren 3aconfidence interval 3aeducation 3amidwives 3amothers 3apain 3arisk 3avaccination 3avaccines 3aMichigan 0aVaccination 0aMichigan 0aUp-to-date vaccination 0aShot-limiting 0aPrevalence1 aDietz, Stephanie1 aPotter, Rachel1 aSwanson, Robert1 aMiller, Corinne1 aMcFadden, Jevon0 tVaccine.g2017 Feb. 15, v. 35, no. 7 p.1018-1023dElsevier LtdwJournal:6210x0264-410X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2017.01.0133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02310naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001200152245009400164520102300258592002801281650001401309650001901323650001401342650001701356650001501373650001801388650001801406650001501424650001401439653002801453653002501481653000901506653001901515653002201534653001701556700005501573700001701628700001301645700001601658773010601674856008701780852000901867655001201876IND60682381020221118030703.0220509e20200420xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068238102DNAL7 a10.1016/j.colsurfa.2020.1244942doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHan, Yu10aStudy of the theory of microbubble bursting to obtain bio-inspired alginate nanoparticles  aThrough the bursting of microbubbles prepared by a T-junction microfluidic device with uniform particle size, bio-inspired alginate nanoparticles were obtained via shell disintegration process. The high-speed microscopy and digital image technology were used to observe the evolution of the microbubble raft before bubble bursting. To investigate the mechanism of nanoparticle formation, a theoretical approach combining the shell disintegration theory and the rule of the ligament breakup was developed through which the size of nanoparticles could be predicted. Such analysis showed that the bubble size and the viscosity of the alginate solution to generate bubbles were both key factors for determining the average particle size and size distribution and such results were proved experimentally. Also, the size distribution of the nanoparticles were found to be very well represented by gamma distributions, underlying the crucial role played by the ligament dynamics in building up the broad statistics of sprays.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalginates 3adigital images 3aligaments 3amicrobubbles 3amicroscopy 3ananoparticles 3aparticle size 3astatistics 3aviscosity 0aMicrofluidic T-junction 0aMicrobubble bursting 0aFilm 0adisintegration 0aLigament dynamics 0aNanoparticle1 aXu, Xiaofei1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2034-01041 aLiu, Fengxia1 aWei, Wei1 aLiu, Zhijun0 tColloids and surfaces.g2020 Apr. 20, v. 591 p.124494-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11945x0927-77577nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfa.2020.1244943Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02369naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001300151245007600164300001800240520108600258592002801344650002001372650002001392650001901412650001201431650001301443650001901456650001201475650001101487650001301498650002801511650001601539650001301555650001201568651001001580653002801590653001701618653001201635700002501647700002801672700001801700773009801718856008601816852000901902655001201911IND60561150220221119180816.0190319e20170301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056115022DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vaccine.2017.01.0152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXing, Yi10aTick-borne encephalitis in China: A review of epidemiology and vaccines  ap. 1227-1237.  aTick-borne encephalitis (TBE) has been shown to be endemic in northern and western China, including the three mountain areas in Heilongjiang, Jilin, Inner Mongolia, and Xinjiang. In addition, serology evidence shows that there is human infection in south-west provinces of China, including Xizang (Tibet) and Yunnan. TBE in China is caused by the Far Eastern TBE virus subtype and there is no biphasic course for disease presentation. The majority of TBE cases in China have occurred in people who were living or working in forests. TBE vaccines became available in China soon after the virus was identified in the country and they have been used for more than 60years to date, with different vaccine types used in different periods. Currently, an inactivated and purified whole-virus vaccine produced in a primary hamster kidney (PHK) cell line is used. Clinical trials have shown this vaccine to have higher immunogenicity and fewer adverse reactions than previous TBE vaccines. This paper provides a review on the epidemiology of TBE and the history of TBE vaccination in China.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadverse effects 3aclinical trials 3adisease course 3aforests 3ahamsters 3ahuman diseases 3akidneys 3apeople 3aserology 3atick-borne encephalitis 3avaccination 3avaccines 3aviruses 3aChina 0aTick borne encephalitis 0aEpidemiology 0aVaccine1 aSchmitt, Heinz-Josef1 aArguedas Mohs, Adriano,1 aYang, Junfeng0 tVaccine.g2017 Mar. 01, v. 35, no. 9 p.1227-1237dElsevier LtdwJournal:6210x0264-410X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2017.01.0153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02983naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245014300158300002000301520140500321592002801726650004401754650002201798650003701820650001501857650001401872650002301886650001501909650003701924650001301961650001901974650001301993650001902006650001802025650001302043650001802056650003302074650001302107650001602120650001602136650003702152700001802189700002302207700002002230700002002250773012402270856007402394852000902468655001202477IND60667443520221120113149.0190919e20150429xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066744352DNAL7 a10.1039/c5ra03363b2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKumar, Aniket10aDesign of a graphene oxide-SnO₂ nanocomposite with superior catalytic efficiency for the synthesis of β-enaminones and β-enaminoesters  ap. 39193-39204.  aA graphene oxide (GO)–SnO₂-based nanocomposite was synthesized by decorating the graphene oxide surface with SnO₂ nanoparticles via a solvothermal process. The nanocomposite was characterized using Fourier transform infrared spectra (FTIR), FT-Raman spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), Field-emission Scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM), Energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and N₂ adsorption/desorption study. The FE-SEM and TEM images demonstrate the uniform distribution of the SnO₂ nanoparticles on the GO surface and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) confirms an average particle size of 8–12 nm. The GO–SnO₂ nanocomposite has been found to be an extremely efficient catalyst for the synthesis of β-enaminones and β-enaminoesters in methanol solvent and also, in solventless conditions. The GO–SnO₂ nanocomposites exhibited synergistically more superior catalytic efficiency compared to pure graphene oxide and SnO₂ nanoparticles. The reaction conditions were optimized by changing different parameters such as catalyst, solvent, catalyst loading, and temperature. It has been found that the catalyst gave higher activity under solventless conditions than methanol. The GO–SnO₂ composite was recycled for up to four cycles with minimal loss in activity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aX-ray diffraction 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3aadsorption 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3adesorption 3aenergy-dispersive X-ray analysis 3agraphene 3agraphene oxide 3amethanol 3ananocomposites 3ananoparticles 3anitrogen 3aparticle size 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asolvents 3atemperature 3atin dioxide 3atransmission electron microscopy1 aRout, Lipeeka1 aDhaka, Rajendra S.1 aSamal, Saroj L.1 aDash, Priyabrat0 tRSC advances.g2015 Apr. 29, v. 5, no. 49 p.39193-39204dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c5ra03363b3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03540naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100002300137245014600160300001600306520208300322592002802405650001502433650001902448650001602467650001702483650001402500650001102514650001402525650002202539650001902561650001002580650001402590651002502604653003002629653002302659653001502682653001702697653001802714653002002732653002502752653002102777653001302798700002302811700002302834773010902857856007102966852000903037655001203046IND60536788820221117232117.0160806s2016    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053678882DNAL7 a10.1071/WF150102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFairman, Thomas A.10aToo much, too soon? A review of the effects of increasing wildfire frequency on tree mortality and regeneration in temperate eucalypt forests  ap. 831-848.  aIn temperate Australia, wildfires are predicted to be more frequent and severe under climate change. This could lead to marked changes in tree mortality and regeneration in the region’s predominant eucalypt forests, which have been burned repeatedly by extensive wildfires in the period 2003–14. Recent studies have applied alternative stable state models to select ‘fire sensitive’ forest types, but comparable models have not been rigorously examined in relation to the more extensive ‘fire tolerant’ forests in the region. We review the effects of increasing wildfire frequency on tree mortality and regeneration in temperate forests of Victoria, south-eastern Australia, based on the functional traits of the dominant eucalypts: those that are typically killed by wildfire to regenerate from seed (‘obligate seeders’) and those that mostly survive to resprout (‘resprouters’). In Victoria, over 4.3 million ha of eucalypt forest has been burned by wildfire in the last decade (2003–14), roughly equivalent to the cumulative area burned in the previous 50 years (1952–2002; 4.4 million ha). This increased wildfire activity has occurred regardless of several advancements in fire management, and has resulted in over 350000ha of eucalypt forest being burned twice or more by wildfire at short (≤11 year) intervals. Historical and recent evidence indicates that recurrent wildfires threaten the persistence of the ‘fire sensitive’ obligate seeder eucalypt forests, which can facilitate a shift to non-forest states if successive fires occur within the trees’ primary juvenile period (1–20 years). Our review also highlights potential for structural and state changes in the ‘fire tolerant’ resprouter forests, particularly if recurrent severe wildfires kill seedlings and increase tree mortality. We present conceptual models of state changes in temperate eucalypt forests with increasing wildfire frequency, and highlight knowledge gaps relating to the development and persistence of alternative states driven by changes in fire regimes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEucalyptus 3aclimate change 3afire regime 3aforest types 3ajuveniles 3amodels 3aseedlings 3atemperate forests 3atree mortality 3atrees 3awildfires 3aVictoria (Australia) 0aalternative stable states 0acumulative impacts 0aEucalyptus 0afire regimes 0afire severity 0aforest dynamics 0anatural disturbances 0atemperate forest 0awildfire1 aNitschke, Craig R.1 aBennett, Lauren T.0 tInternational journal of wildland fire.g2016, v. 25, no. 8 p.831-848dCSIRO Publishingx1049-80017nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1071/WF150103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03414naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100005100139245010900190300001800299500002000317520164900337592002801986596005202014596004202066650000802108650001302116650002202129650001702151650000902168650001402177650001002191650002002201650001202221650003402233650000902267650001102276650001602287650001202303650001702315650002102332650001602353700005602369700005702425700005902482700002202541700005902563700006202622773011702684856007402801852000902875655001202884IND60793527220221119013323.0220917e202209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079352722DNAL7 a10.1111/tpj.159182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWu, Hao1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0535-534810aRearrangement with the nkd2 promoter contributed to allelic diversity of the r1 gene in maize (Zea mays)  ap. 1701-1716.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe maize red1 (r1) locus regulates anthocyanin accumulation and is a classic model for allelic diversity; changes in regulatory regions are responsible for most of the variation in gene expression patterns. Here, an intrachromosomal rearrangement between the distal upstream region of r1 and the region of naked endosperm 2 (nkd2) upstream to the third exon generated a nkd2 null allele lacking the first three exons, and the R1‐st (stippled) allele with a novel r1 5′ promoter region homologous to 5′ regions from nkd2‐B73. R1‐sc:124 (an R1‐st derivative) shows increased and earlier expression than a standard R1‐g allele, as well as ectopic expression in the starchy endosperm compartment. Laser capture microdissection and RNA sequencing indicated that ectopic R1‐sc:124 expression impacted expression of genes associated with RNA modification. The expression of R1‐sc:124 resembled nkd2‐W22 expression, suggesting that nkd2 regulatory sequences may influence the expression of R1‐sc:124. The r1‐sc:m3 allele is derived from R1‐sc:124 by an insertion of a Ds6 transposon in intron 4. This insertion blocks anthocyanin regulation by causing mis‐splicing that eliminates exon 5 from the mRNA. This allele serves as an important launch site for Ac/Ds mutagenesis studies, and two Ds6 insertions believed to be associated with nkd2 mutant alleles were actually located in the r1 5′ region. Among annotated genomes of teosinte and maize varieties, the nkd2 and r1 loci showed conserved overall gene structures, similar to the B73 reference genome, suggesting that the nkd2‐r1 rearrangement may be a recent event.  aPublisher supplied data  aIOS‐1444568cU.S. National Science Foundation  aIOW03649cNational Science Foundation 3aRNA 3aZea mays 3aallelic variation 3aanthocyanins 3acorn 3aendosperm 3aexons 3agene expression 3aintrons 3alaser capture microdissection 3aloci 3amodels 3amutagenesis 3amutants 3anull alleles 3apromoter regions 3atransposons1 aLi, Guosheng1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9760-05871 aZhan, Junpeng1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7353-76081 aZhang, Shanshan1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0814-71731 aBeall, Brandon D.1 aYadegari, Ramin1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0975-29841 aBecraft, Philip W.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3299-21260 tplant journal.g2022 Sept., v. 111, no. 6 p.1701-1716dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl47643x0960-74127nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/tpj.159183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02139naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002200140245009600162300002000258520101700278592002801295650002001323650000901343650001001352650001801362650001601380650001601396650002101412650003101433700001901464700001501483700001901498700002101517700001901538773012401557856007501681852000901756655001201765IND60667443820221120102444.0211212e20150409xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066744382DNAL7 a10.1039/c5ra03370e2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDuong, Thanh-Tung10aEnhancement of solar cell efficiency using perovskite dyes deposited via a two-step process  ap. 33515-33523.  aThis study examined the effect of different thick-compact-TiO₂ blocking layers (c-TiO₂) and mesoporous-TiO₂ layers (m-TiO₂) on the efficiency of perovskite cells. Anatase c-TiO₂ layers with different thicknesses were in situ deposited onto a FTO/glass substrate at a temperature of 400 °C via nano-cluster deposition (NCD).

The perovskite cells with 80 nm-thick c-TiO₂ and 600 nm-thick-m-TiO₂ layers showed the highest photovoltaic parameters: JSC of 21.0 mA cm⁻², VOC of 0.89 V, FF of 62%, and efficiency (η) of 11.5%. For enhancement of the cell efficiency, solar cells with bi-layer perovskite dyes were deposited via a two-step process onto the m-TiO₂ layer (200 nm)/TiO₂ blocking layers (80 nm) and showed VOC and FF values of approximately 1.06 and 64%, respectively, with a maximum photo-conversion efficiency of approximately 14.2%.  aPublisher supplied data 3acrystallization 3adyes 3aglass 3ananoparticles 3asolar cells 3atemperature 3atitanium dioxide 3avolatile organic compounds1 aKim, Yun-Jeong1 aEom, Ji-Ho1 aChoi, Jin-Seok1 aLê, Anh Tuấn,1 aYoon, Soon-Gil0 tRSC advances.g2015 Apr. 09, v. 5, no. 42 p.33515-33523dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c5ra03370e3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03559naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001400147245010600161300001600267520176200283592002802045650003602073650002502109650002202134650002902156650002602185650002502211650005602236650001502292650001102307650002102318650002502339650002602364650001002390650002002400650003102420650001402451650003002465650001002495650001202505650001502517651001002532700001802542700002602560700002002586700001902606700002802625700001802653700001602671700002702687700001502714700002702729773012302756856008102879852000902960655001202969IND60439279820221122060241.0151024e201510  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6043927982DNAL7 a10.1007/s10344-015-0937-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRisco, D.10aPathological observations of porcine respiratory disease complex (PRDC) in the wild boar (Sus scrofa)  ap. 669-679.  aPorcine respiratory disease complex (PRDC) is a multifactorial respiratory syndrome related to the infection with different pathogens. Although most of these pathogens have been detected in the wild boar, the PRDC pneumonic lesions in this species have not been characterized. The aims of this study were to assess the presence of the main swine respiratory pathogens in wild boar populations from mid-western Spain and to describe the pathological features present in the lung from animals infected with PRDC pathogens. A pathological assessment based on five histological parameters was carried out in lung sections from 210 hunted wild boar. The presence of Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae, Haemophilus parasuis, Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae, Pasteurella multocida, Aujeszky’s disease virus, and porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2) in lungs was assessed by the use of specific PCR assays. Additionally, immunohistochemical techniques were carried out to detect swine influenza virus (SIV) and porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) infection in the lungs. Furthermore, the distribution of infected cells with PCV2 and the presence of M. hyopneumoniae throughout the pulmonary parenchyma were evaluated using immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization assays in a subset of animals. Wild boar infected with M. hyopneumoniae, H. parasuis, or P. multocida showed the most severe lesions. M. hyopneumoniae, SIV, PCV2, and PRRSV were detected in single or mixed infections. Animals suffering from mixed infections with M. hyopneumoniae together with different viruses showed severe bronchopneumonia associated with interstitial pneumonia, suggesting that interactions between pathogens might increase the severity of pathological outcomes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aActinobacillus pleuropneumoniae 3aHaemophilus parasuis 3aInfluenza A virus 3aMycoplasma hyopneumoniae 3aPasteurella multocida 3aPorcine circovirus-2 3aPorcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus 3aSus scrofa 3aassays 3abronchopneumonia 3aimmunohistochemistry 3ain situ hybridization 3alungs 3amixed infection 3aparenchyma (animal tissue) 3apathogens 3apolymerase chain reaction 3aswine 3aviruses 3awild boars 3aSpain1 aCuesta, J.

This method was accurate (⩾99.5%), and it exhibited limits of detection and quantification values in the 0.006–0.091 and 0.020–0.314μgkg⁻¹ ranges, respectively. Furthermore, the coefficients of variations (⩾0.9999) were less than 1% at the low μgkg⁻¹ end of the method. Mean recoveries ranged between 94% and 102%, and relative standard deviations were below 10%. Based on these results, the methodology was proven to be highly efficient, robust, and suitable for monitoring the maximum residue limits (MRL) compliance of a wide range of commodity/pesticide combination. This method was successfully applied to the analysis of vegetable samples that were collected from different government farmers’ markets and street shops in urban areas.

In this regard, hematite (α-Fe₂O₃) nanostructures with controlled nano-organization have been fabricated and investigated for use as anodes in photoelectrochemical (PEC) cells. The target systems have been grown on conductive substrates by plasma enhanced-chemical vapor deposition (PE-CVD) and subjected to eventual ex situ annealing in air to further tailor their structure and properties. A detailed multitechnique approach has enabled to elucidate the interrelations between system characteristics and the generated photocurrent. The present α-Fe₂O₃ systems are characterized by a high purity and hierarchical morphologies consisting of nanopyramids/organized dendrites, offering a high contact area with the electrolyte. PEC data reveal a dramatic response enhancement upon thermal treatment, related to a more efficient electron transfer. The reasons underlying such a phenomenon are elucidated and discussed by transient absorption spectroscopy (TAS) studies of photogenerated charge carrier kinetics, investigated on different time scales for the first time on PE-CVD Fe₂O₃ nanostructures.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3aannealing 3aanodes 3adendrites 3aelectrolytes 3aelectron transfer 3aenergy 3aharvesting 3aheat treatment 3ahematite 3ahydrogen 3ananomaterials 3arenewable energy sources 3aspectroscopy 3avapors 0ahematite 0aPE-CVD 0ahierarchical structures 0awater splitting 0aPEC 0atransient absorption spectroscopy1 aKaunisto, Kimmo1 aBarreca, Davide1 aCarraro, Giorgio1 aGasparotto, Alberto1 aMaccato, Chiara1 aBontempi, Elza1 aSada, Cinzia1 aRuoko, Tero-Petri1 aTurner, Stuart1 aTendeloo, G.

Its high omega‐3 content and growing demand for clean food processing technologies make conventional oil extraction less attractive. In this study, the effect of extraction methods on the bioactive lipid composition of the camelina seed lipid was investigated, and its bioactive lipid composition was modified at the extraction stage using ethanol‐modified supercritical carbon dioxide (SC‐CO₂). Ethanol‐modified SC‐CO₂ extractions were carried out at varying temperatures (50 and 70 °C), pressures (35 and 45 MPa), and ethanol concentrations (0–10%, w/w), and were compared to SC‐CO₂, cold press, and hexane extraction. The highest total lipid yield (37.6%) was at 45 MPa/70 °C/10% (w/w) ethanol. Phospholipids and phenolic content increased significantly with ethanol‐modified SC‐CO₂ (p < 0.05). SC‐CO₂ with 10% (w/w) ethanol concentration selectively increased phosphatidylcholine (PC) content. Apparent solubility of camelina seed lipids in SC‐CO₂, determined using the Chrastil model, ranged from 0.0065 kg oil/kg CO₂ (35 MPa/50 °C) to 0.0133 kg oil/kg CO₂ (45 MPa/70 °C). Ethanol‐modified SC‐CO₂ extraction allowed modification of the lipid composition that was not possible with the conventional extraction methods. This is a promising green method for extraction and fractionation of camelina seed lipids to separate and enrich its bioactives.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCamelina sativa 3acarbon dioxide 3aethanol 3afood processing 3afractionation 3ahexane 3alipid composition 3amodels 3aoils 3aphosphatidylcholines 3asolubility 3asupercritical fluid extraction 3atemperature1 aWehling, Randy L.1 aReddy, Anji K.1 aCahoon, Edgar B.1 aCiftci, Ozan N.0 tThe journal of the American Oil Chemists' Society.g2017 June, v. 94, no. 6 p.855-865dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl49535x0003-021X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11746-017-2993-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03452naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100005700146245018500203300001800388520191100406592002802317650001502345650001402360650002002374650003002394650000902424650001302433650001902446650000902465650001402474650001502488650003402503650001702537650001602554700002402570700001902594700006102613700005902674700006102733773013502794856008002929852000903009655001203018IND60683910120200331000000.0200213e20200123xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068391012DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcc.9b097952doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aInami, Eiichi1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2167-851010aDirect Imaging of Precursor Adcomplex States during Cryogenic-Temperature On-Surface Metalation: Scanning Tunneling Microscopy Study on Porphyrin Array with Fe Adsorption at 78.5 K  ap. 3621-3631.  aOn-surface metalation of metal-free π-conjugated planar molecules, such as metal-free tetraphenylporphyrin (2HTPP), using 3d transition metals prepared in ultrahigh vacuum (UHV), attracted significant attention as a newly developed bottom-up method to create a building block for 1-nm-size nano devices, one- or two-dimensional nano networks, as a precursor of further on-surface synthesis or a magnetic atom array aligned on a well-ordered molecular template with an extreme low impurity concentration. Experimental and theoretical studies for this type of on-surface metalation via dehydrogenation (e.g., 2HTPP + Fe → H₂ + FeTPP) have been successfully demonstrated by depositing 3d metal atoms on metal-free π-conjugated planar molecular array at 300 K with subsequent annealing of 350–700 K in UHV. Significantly, photoemission spectroscopy study for the on-surface metalation process at cryogenic temperatures suggested a precursor adcomplex state different from the normal metalation state. In this study, we demonstrate that on-surface metalation at cryogenic temperature reduces thermal diffusion of both metal atoms and molecules, which allows gentle adsorption of the 3d metal atoms inside the molecule, providing precursor adcomplex states while preserving the original well-ordering molecular array structure. Using scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) we investigated Fe deposition on a well-ordered metal-free tetraphenylporphyrin (2HTPP) monolayer array islands with an Au(111) substrate temperature maintained at 78.5 K. Through direct STM topographic and spectroscopy imaging supported by density functional theory calculations, we identify three types of TPP appearance: (1) original 2HTPP, (2) 2HTPP with an Fe atom on top (precursor adcomplex “α” state), and (3) 2HTPP with an Fe atom inside (precursor adcomplex “γ” state, where a clear LUMO peak change was observed).  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3aannealing 3adehydrogenation 3adensity functional theory 3agold 3ahydrogen 3aimage analysis 3airon 3amagnetism 3aporphyrins 3ascanning tunneling microscopy 3aspectroscopy 3atemperature1 aYamaguchi, Masataka1 aNemoto, Ryohei1 aYorimitsu, Hideki1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0153-18881 aKrüger, Peter,1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1247-98861 aYamada, Toyo Kazu1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5185-64720 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2020 Jan. 23, v. 124, no. 6 p.3621-3631dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23573x1932-74557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcc.9b097953Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02715naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002400147245011500171300001600286500002000302520134700322592002801669596008101697650001201778650002101790650002201811650001401833650002701847650002101874650001401895650000901909650001501918650001001933651001601943700002601959700001801985700002202003700002402025773015302049856008202202852000902284655001202293IND60575299720221117015557.0220804e201706  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057529972DNAL7 a10.1007/s11746-017-2989-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZamany, Ahmad Jawid10aComparative Study of Tocopherol Contents and Fatty Acids Composition in Twenty Almond Cultivars of Afghanistan  ap. 805-817.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aAfghanistan is the fourth largest producer of almonds in the world producing 78 native and 6 imported cultivars. However, till date, there have been no comprehensive data on nutrient profiles of the native cultivars. Thus, in the present investigation, tocopherol contents and fatty acid composition from the kernels of 20 selected native almond cultivars of Afghanistan were analyzed. The ranges of variability for the studied nutrients were similar to those already reported for almonds grown in other countries, such as 47.8–66.1% of total lipids (fresh weight basis), 62.54–81.57% of oleic acid in the total lipids, and 139.1–355.0 μg/g α‐tocopherol in kernels. With respect to cultivars, significantly (p < 0.05) high content of total lipids were recorded in ‘Belabai’ and ‘Sattarbai’ (Afghan grade), oleic acid in ‘Khairodini’ and of α‐tocopherol in ‘Khairodini‐161 Samangan’ and ‘Belabai’ cultivars. Kernels from these cultivars can be used for nutrient dense food formulations. Daily consumption of 50 g almonds is sufficient to meet the RDA of α‐tocopherol (15 mg/day), considering the average 300 μg/g of α‐tocopherol in Afghan almonds. Also, these nutrient rich cultivars can be used in almond breeding programs globally, to focus on improving kernel oil composition and nutrient contents.  aPublisher supplied data  cKU research professor program of Konkuk University, Seoul, Republic of Korea 3aalmonds 3aalpha-tocopherol 3abreeding programs 3acultivars 3afatty acid composition 3anutrient content 3anutrients 3aoils 3aoleic acid 3aseeds 3aAfghanistan1 aSamadi, Ghulam Rasoul1 aKim, Doo Hwan1 aKeum, Young‐Soo1 aSaini, Ramesh Kumar0 tThe journal of the American Oil Chemists' Society.g2017 June, v. 94, no. 6 p.805-817dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl49535x0003-021X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11746-017-2989-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03171naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002900151245016400180520155300344592002801897650001301925650001301938650002101951650002301972650001101995650001502006650001302021650002602034650002202060650003402082650002602116650000902142650001502151650002102166650001402187650001302201650001402214650003202228650001202260651001102272653003202283653002302315653001302338653003702351653001702388700006102405773009202466856008602558852000902644655001202653IND60722036120221120070126.0220628e20210401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072203612DNAL7 a10.1016/j.talanta.2020.1220362doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKasperkiewicz, Alexander10aMulti-class pesticide analysis in cannabis oil using coated blade spray and solid-phase microextraction with liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry  aThe application of solid-phase microextraction (SPME) coupled to mass spectrometry to provide a high-throughput and cost-effective solution to multi-residue analysis of pesticides in cannabis oil samples has not been extensively explored. In this work, the method development steps for the extraction of an initial target list of 74 pesticides from cannabis oil via SPME for analysis with both LC-MS/MS and coated blade spray (CBS) are presented. The exploration of a washing step to remove adhered oil whilst minimally desorbing extracted analytes along with the implementation of central composited design investigation to examine compound extraction kinetics in the non-polar matrix yielded a workflow that was validated via both instrumental techniques. Of the initial target list, 37 pesticides were found to be suitable for screening or quantitation via CBS with performance validated via LC-MS/MS. The majority of compounds were found to meet the EU SANTE guidelines for analysis (i.e. linearity, precision, accuracy) whilst reaching limits of quantitation below or at Health Canada minimum regulatory limits (majority at 10 ng/mL). Examination of factors contributing to poor quantitation of pesticides via CBS are shared and explored, such as contributing isobaric interference sourced from plant byproducts and carrier oil, and comparison of signal-to-noise values achieved in cannabis oil when compared to the cannabis-free medium-chain triglyceride oil used as a carrier oil to stress the importance of matrix-match method development.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCannabis 3aaccuracy 3achemical species 3acost effectiveness 3adesign 3aguidelines 3akinetics 3aliquid chromatography 3amass spectrometry 3amedium chain triacylglycerols 3amultiresidue analysis 3aoils 3apesticides 3aplant byproducts 3aprecision 3asampling 3ascreening 3asolid phase microextraction 3awashing 3aCanada 0aSolid phase microextraction 0aCoated blade spray 0aLC-MS/MS 0aPesticide multi-residue analysis 0aCannabis oil1 aPawliszyn, Janusz1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9975-58110 tTalanta.g2021 Apr. 01, v. 225 p.122036-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11742x0039-91407nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.talanta.2020.1220363Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01633naa a2200325 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097245005200115300001000167500001500177520077800192650001600970650002100986650001501007650002101022650000901043650001701052653002901069653002201098653002801120653001101148773007301159852000901232939003301241945000801274946001301282655001201295991610906520742620221120232205.0800123e197909  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI800002672DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL10aMedium-chain triglycerides in clinical practice  ap. 5.  a2019-12-06  aLong-chain triglycerides, which comprise most of the fat in foods, are digested and absorbed by complex processes.

A eta(0)-Mw-c relationship (eta(0) = 10(-3) + 6.04 x 10(-5) cMw(0.71) + 2.56 x 10(-6) c(2) Mw(1.42) + 2.70 x 10(-15) c(5.18) Mw(3.68) did not reveal any evidence of association tendencies in the concentrated fresh solution either. However, rheological measurements showed a transition from typical viscoelastic behaviour to gel-like properties over a period of several hours, with a long induction period which allows rheological measurements in the sol state. In shear experiments the concentrated beta-glucan solutions showed flow irregularities correlating with a Weissenberg number (N1/tau) in the range 1-3. Repeated cycles of short-term steady shear and rest periods accelerated the sol-gel transition, whereas steady shear did not induce gelation. Barley beta-glucan in freshly prepared aqueous solution behaves like a viscoelastic liquid, without any associated structures being detected even over a period of several hours, despite its ability to form solid gels. 3aaqueous solutions 3abarley 3abeta-glucans 3agel chromatography 3agelation 3agels 3alight scattering 3amolecular weight 3aviscoelasticity 3aviscometry1 aKulicke, W.M.0 tCarbohydrate research.g1999 Feb. 28, v. 315, no. 3/4 p.293-301x0008-62157nnas  aDNAL  a19991003b19991007c00000000  aINDdLP1  aNon-US 7aarticle01554naa a2200289 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097245006300115300001200178300002000190520075900210650001700969650002200986650001101008650001801019650002601037650002001063653003401083773007201117852000901189939003301198945000801231946001301239655001201252991610906220742620221120232213.0820614e198006  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI820008282DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL10aNutritional management of the diabetic patient on dialysis  ap. 3-4.  ap. 3-4. charts.  aCareful balance of 2 therapeutic diets is necessary for hemodialysis patients with insulin-dependent diabetes; fortunately the 2 diets are compatible.

For further structural analysis, oligosaccharides were generated by partial acid hydrolysis and then isolated by high-pH anion-exchange chromatography (HPAEC). Each HPAEC fraction was shown by ESMS to contain one major oligosaccharide and several minor components. Partial structures of the oligosaccharides were determined using GC-MS, ESMS and ES tandem mass spectrometry (ESMS/MS). A (1 leads to 4)-linked xylan trisaccharide and (1 leads to 3)-linked xylan oligosaccharides with DP 6-11 suggested that the backbone of the heteroxylan polysaccharide consisted of blocks of (1 leads to 4)-linked and (1 leads to 3)-linked Xylp residues. A (1 leads to 2)-linked Xylp disaccharide and a branched tetrasaccharide were also found, revealing that single Xylp residues are linked to the O-2 of some of the (1 leads to 4)-linked Xylp residues in the backbone. In addition, our results confirm the presence of side chains consisting of the disaccharide GlcpA-(1 leads to 3)-Araf. 3aPlantago major 3aacid hydrolysis 3aanion exchange chromatography 3agas chromatography-mass spectrometry 3amethylation 3aseeds 3atandem mass spectrometry 3atrisaccharides 3axylan1 aCohen, E.H.1 aPaulsen, B.S.1 aBrull, L.P.1 aThomas-Oates, J.E.0 tCarbohydrate research.g1999 Feb. 28, v. 315, no. 3/4 p.312-318x0008-62157nnas  aDNAL  a19991003b19991007c00000000  aINDdLP1  aNon-US 7aarticle02992naa a2200289 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092024002200127024001900149040001800168100002300186245011700209300001400326520197800340653000902318653004902327653005102376653001402427700002002441773012202461852000902583856008502592946001302677655001202690IND4447478320221120221738.0110114e201101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444747832DNAL7 a10.1007/s00280-010-1526-32doi7 aPMC32753402pmcid7 a211166242pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGounder, Mrinal M.10aMolecular basis for primary and secondary tyrosine kinase inhibitor resistance in gastrointestinal stromal tumor  ap. 25-43.  aSmall molecule kinase inhibitors have irrevocably altered cancer treatment. March 2010 marks the 10th anniversary of using imatinib in gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST), a cardinal example of the utility of such targeted therapy in a solid tumor. Before imatinib, metastatic GIST was frustrating to treat due to its resistance to standard cytotoxic chemotherapy. Median survival for patients with metastatic GIST improved from 19 to 60 months with imatinib. In treating patients with GIST, two patterns of tyrosine kinase inhibitor resistance have been observed. In the first, ~9-14% of patients have progression within 3 months of starting imatinib. These patients are classified as having primary or early resistance. Median progression-free survival (PFS) on imatinib is approximately 24 months; patients with later progression are classified as having secondary or acquired resistance. Primary studies and a meta-analysis of studies of imatinib in GIST patients have identified prognostic features that contribute to treatment failure. One of the strongest predictors for success of therapy is KIT or PDGFRA mutational status. Patients with KIT exon 11 mutant GIST have better response rates, PFS, and overall survival compared to other mutations. A great deal has been learned in the last decade about sensitivity and resistance of GIST to imatinib; however, many unanswered questions remain about secondary resistance mechanisms and clinical management in the third- and fourth-line setting. This review will discuss the role of dose effects, and early and late resistance to imatinib and their clinical implications. Patients intolerant to imatinib (5%) and those who progress on imatinib are treated with sunitinib. The mechanism of resistance to sunitinib is unknown at this time but is also appears related to growth of clones with secondary mutations in KIT. Third- and fourth-line treatments of GIST and with future treatment strategies are also discussed. 0aGIST 0aPrimary tyrosine kinase inhibitor resistance 0aSecondary tyrosine kinase inhibitor resistance 0aNilotinib1 aMaki, Robert G.0 tCancer chemotherapy and pharmacology.g2011 Jan., v. 67 p.25-43dBerlin/Heidelberg : Springer-Verlagx0344-57047nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00280-010-1526-33Available from publisher's Web site  aOther US 7aarticle02283naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001900145245008900164300001400253520124000267653000901507653001601516653003101532653001901563700002001582700001901602700001801621700003401639700002001673700002301693773012201716852000901838856008501847946001301932655001201945IND4447478220221120221704.0110114e201101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444747822DNAL7 a10.1007/s00280-010-1513-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Weilian.10aMechanisms of resistance to imatinib and sunitinib in gastrointestinal stromal tumor  ap. 15-24.  aGastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST), the most common mesenchymal neoplasm of the GI tract and one of the most common sarcomas, is dependent on the expression of the mutated KIT or platelet-derived growth factor receptor in most cases. Imatinib mesylate potently abrogates the effects of KIT signaling by directly binding into the ATP-binding pocket of the kinase. It is becoming increasingly apparent that the binding affinity of imatinib for the receptor is dependent on the type and location of mutation. Within KIT, patients whose tumor has an exon 9 mutation are treated by many clinicians with higher doses of imatinib than those patients with mutations within exon 11. Additionally, there are over 400 unique mutations within exon 11 that may have distinctly different binding affinity for imatinib as well as other kinases. Secondary KIT mutations generally occur at a codon where imatinib binds resulting in KIT reactivation and resistance. Sunitinib malate, a second-generation KIT inhibitor is active in imatinib-resistant disease and is FDA-approved for use in this setting. In this review, we describe the biology of the genes and gene mutations responsible for GIST and discuss known and potential clinical implications. 0aGIST 0aMutated KIT 0aImatinib-resistant disease 0aGene mutations1 aConley, Anthony1 aReynoso, David1 aNolden, Laura1 aLazar, Alexanderc(Physician)1 aGeorge, Suzanne1 aTrent, Jonathan C.0 tCancer chemotherapy and pharmacology.g2011 Jan., v. 67 p.15-24dBerlin/Heidelberg : Springer-Verlagx0344-57047nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00280-010-1513-83Available from publisher's Web site  aOther US 7aarticle02781naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004000111040001800151100001800169245009600187300001800283500002400301520120400325650000801529650001701537650001101554650001301565650001301578650001401591650001101605650001001616650001501626650004401641650003001685650002701715650002501742650002801767650002901795650003901824650003801863650004601901650002501947650001701972650002601989700001402015700002302029700001802052700002002070773009902090852000902189856005302198655001202251IND4442286120221120033217.0100910e201012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444228612DNAL7 a207095382pmid7 a10.1016/j.biortech.2010.07.0872doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Jiachun10aHigh-rate nitrogen removal by the Anammox process with a sufficient inorganic carbon source  ap. 9471-9478.  aIncludes references  aThis study focused on high-rate nitrogen removal by the anaerobic ammonium oxidation (Anammox) process with a sufficient inorganic carbon (IC) source. Experiments were carried out in an up-flow column Anammox reactor fed with synthetic inorganic wastewater for 110days. The IC source was added into the influent tank in the form of bicarbonate. The results confirmed the positive impact of inorganic matter on stimulating Anammox activity. After the addition of sufficient IC, the nitrogen removal rate sharply increased from 5.2 to 11.8kg-Nm⁻³ day⁻¹ within only 32days. NO₂-N inhibition was not observed even at NO₂-N concentrations greater than 460mgN/L, indicating the enriched Anammox consortium adapted to high NO₂-N concentrations. The ratio of NO₂-N removal, NO₃-N production and NH₄-N removal for the reactor was correspondingly changed from 1.21:0.21:1 to 1.24:0.18:1. Simultaneously, the sludge volume index of the Anammox granules decreased markedly from 36.8 to 21.5mL/g, which was attributed to the implementation of proper operational strategy. In addition, DNA analysis revealed that a shift from the KSU-1 strain to the KU2 strain occurred in the Anammox community. 3aDNA 3abicarbonates 3acarbon 3agranules 3anitrogen 3aoxidation 3asludge 3atanks 3awastewater 2aAdaptation, Physiologicalxdrug effects 2aBioreactorsxmicrobiology 2aBiotechnologyxmethods 2aCarbonxpharmacology 2aDNA, Archaealxgenetics 2aDNA, Bacterialxgenetics 2aNitrogenxisolation & purification 2aOxidation-Reductionxdrug effects 2aQuaternary Ammonium Compoundsxmetabolism 2aSewagexmicrobiology 2aTime Factors 2aWaste Disposal, Fluid1 aZhang, Li1 aFukuzaki, Yasuhiro1 aHira, Daisuke1 aFurukawa, Kenji0 tBioresource technology.g2010 Dec., v. 101, no. 24 p.9471-9478dElsevier Ltd.x0960-85247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2010.07.087 7aarticle01840naa a2200409 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024001800097040001800115100002400133245007000157300001800227300002300245500001500268520074700283650001001030650001201040650001001052650001801062650001701080650002201097650002801119650001801147650001301165650001101178650001501189650001401204653002401218653003201242773008101274852000901355939003301364945000801397946001301405655001201418991610884090742620221120025508.0811006s1970    xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI810017572DNAL7 a52743132pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCaldwell, Robert C.10aPhysical properties of foods and their caries-producing potential  ap. 1293-1299.  ap. 1293-1299. ill.  a2019-12-05  aThe cariogenicity of food is associated with its physical properties.

Factors influencing intra-oral food retention include adhesion and solubility of food, wettability of the tooth surface, physiological cleansing actions of saliva and lip, tongue, and cheek movements, and bacterial (enzyme) action. Physical properties and chemical composition of foods interact in food cariogenicity. Thus, although the physical texture of food is related to food acceptability and preference, it may one day be possible to change the physical properties of foods known to promote dental caries in order to reduce their cariogenic potential. 3afoods 3atexture 3ateeth 3adental caries 2aAdhesiveness 2aCariogenic Agents 2aDental Cariesxetiology 2aFood Analysis 2aHardness 2aHumans 2aSolubility 2aViscosity 0aphysical properties 0aChemical properties of food0 tJournal of dental research.g1970, v. 49, no. 6 p.1293-1299x0022-03457nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19811006c00000000  aFNC  aOther US 7aarticle01885naa a2200313 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001100110245011900121300001600240500012800256500002400384520079700408650001101205650001701216650001301233650002001246650001501266650001701281650001501298650001601313700001301329773012201342852000901464856008601473655001201559IND4471725120221117181822.0130904s2013    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447172512DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYu, X.10aApplication of several prepared preservative agents and package materials on 'Xin' an-niuxinshi' persimmon storage  ap. 443-446.  aPaper presented at the V International Symposium on Persimmon, held October 20 - 26, 2012,    Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.  aIncludes references  aPreservative agents and package materials of MAP have influence on persimmon storage.

Fruits were significantly larger with better coloration for the KCl in 2005 and 2006, but such an effect was not found in 2007 and 2008. K rates did not change fruit characteristics except for soluble solids that significantly increased for the lower rate in 2007 and 2008. Results indicated that either KCl or K2SO4 would be acceptable as a supplemental K source. 3atree growth 3agrowers 3asoil chemical properties 3abuds 3afruits 3atotal soluble solids 3apersimmons 3aphysicochemical properties 3afruit quality 3atrees 3apotassium chloride 3acolor 3afertigation 3asummer 3aleaves 3ashoots 3aKorean Peninsula 0asoluble solids1 aPark, D.S.1 aYoon, Y.H.1 aJae, H.J.1 aLee, H.Y.0 tActa horticulturae.g2013 June, , no. 996 p.293-297dInternational Society for Horticultural Sciencex0567-75727nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.actahort.org/books/996/996_41.htm3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02875naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245013700126300001600263500012500279500002400404520154700428650001901975650003201994650001102026650001502037650002002052650001302072650002402085650001302109650001902122650001502141650002202156650001002178651001002188700001802198700001502216700001702231773012202248852000902370856008602379655001202465IND4471676520221117171804.0130830s2013    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447167652DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aItamura, H.10aRelationships among ethylene, cell wall degrading enzyme activities and on-tree softening in persimmon (Diospyros kaki Thunb.) fruit  ap. 379-384.  aPaper presented at the V International Symposium on Persimmon, held October 20 - 26, 2012, Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.  aIncludes references  aPersimmon (Diospyros kaki) fruit soften naturally on the tree during late autumn. We investigated the relationships among ethylene production, the cell wall degrading enzymes polygalacturonase (PG), pectinesterase (PE), β-D-galactosidase (β-D-Gal) and α-L-arabinofuranosidase (α-L-Arf), and on-tree softening of persimmon ‘Saijo’ fruit. Fruit were harvested from mid-September to late November from a commercial orchard in Matsue, Japan. Flesh firmness decreased gradually until early November and then decreased rapidly. Activity of PG decreased slightly in early October and thereafter was maintained at the same level until late November. Activity of PE increased during September and October and peaked in mid-November. Activity of β-D-Gal increased rapidly from mid to late November, whereas α-L-Arf activity increased rapidly from early to late November. Fruit that showed abnormal on-tree softening and fruit that represented a softening degree ranging from 1 (firm) to 4 (very soft or part of the peel ruptured) were harvested on the same date in late October and the activity of four cell wall degrading enzymes and internal ethylene concentration were determined. The internal ethylene concentration increased rapidly from softening degree 2 to 3. The activity of PE, β-D-Gal and α-L-Arf increased with advancing degree of softening. Consequently, on-tree fruit softening in late autumn might be caused by cell wall decomposition by the cooperative activities of PE, β-D-Gal, and α-L-Arf induced by ethylene synthesis. 3aDiospyros kaki 3aalpha-N-arabinofuranosidase 3aautumn 3acell walls 3aenzyme activity 3aethylene 3aethylene production 3afirmness 3apectinesterase 3apersimmons 3apolygalacturonase 3atrees 3aJapan1 aNakatsuka, A.1 aAdachi, T.1 aYoshioka, M.0 tActa horticulturae.g2013 June, , no. 996 p.379-384dInternational Society for Horticultural Sciencex0567-75727nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.actahort.org/books/996/996_54.htm3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02227naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001300110245011400123300001600237500012500253500002400378520088200402650001901284650002501303650002201328650002601350650001601376650001901392650001401411650001001425650001601435650002401451650001501475650001401490651001001504700001401514700001401528700001201542700001101554700001101565773012201576852000901698856008601707655001201793IND4471677120221123034735.0130830s2013    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447167712DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, X.10aIsolation of DkADH1 gene from 'Nantong-xiaofangshi' persimmon and construction of its plant expression vector  ap. 417-421.  aPaper presented at the V International Symposium on Persimmon, held October 20 - 26, 2012, Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.  aIncludes references  a‘Nantong-xiaofangshi’ (Diospyros kaki Thunb.), a dwarf persimmon cultivar, originates in Nantong, Jiangsu Province. An alcohol dehydrogenase 1 (ADH1) gene was isolated and named DkADH1. Bioinformatics methods were employed to analyze and predict the genetic encoding protein, secondary and tertiary structure domain, function domain of DkADH1. The results showed that the open reading frame (ORF) of DkADH1 was 1137 nucleotides encoding 379 amino acids. It has the structure domain and function domain of the typical ADH gene. We analyzed the evolution relationship of ADH genes among different species to construct the phylogenetic tree. The results indicated that DkADH1 could be classified into the same group with dicotyledonous plants and was close to Solanum lycopersicum and Solanum tuberosum. The plant expression vector of pYH4215 with DkADH1 gene was constructed. 3aDiospyros kaki 3aSolanum lycopersicum 3aSolanum tuberosum 3aalcohol dehydrogenase 3aamino acids 3abioinformatics 3acultivars 3agenes 3anucleotides 3aopen reading frames 3apersimmons 3aphylogeny 3aChina1 aZhang, Z.1 aZhang, S.1 aLuo, C.1 aTu, X.1 aQu, S.0 tActa horticulturae.g2013 June, , no. 996 p.417-421dInternational Society for Horticultural Sciencex0567-75727nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.actahort.org/books/996/996_60.htm3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02970naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001800110245004300128300001400171500020600185500002400391520148700415650002501902650002201927650001201949650001001961650002801971650001401999650001602013650003202029650001602061650001202077650001702089650001602106650001202122650002002134650002802154650001902182650002402201650001502225650002102240651001602261651000902277773012002286852000902406856008502415655001202500IND4471725920221123020549.0130904s2004    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447172592DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDonnell, M.A.10aStaying competitive in a global market  ap. 41-45.  aPaper presented at the Seventh International Symposium on Protected Cultivation in Mild Winter Climates - Production, Pest Management and Global Competition, held March 23-27, 2004, Kissimmee, Florida.  aIncludes references  aLocally grown hydroponic produce is sold in a competitive, global marketplace. Small to medium-sized producers must maximize yields and profits in order to stay in business. The Ohio Hydroponic Vegetable Program (OHVP) integrates business planning, marketing, horticulture, and greenhouse design support to increase the competitiveness and economic viability of participating growers. A brand, Nature’s Flavors Produce™, has been created for members of the new Great Lakes Hydroponic Association to use. The brand is professionally designed and includes a distinctive logo, point of sale materials, recipe boards, brochures, and more. The brand emphasizes the benefits to consumers of locally grown hydroponic produce. Consumers, produce buyers, and growers are all concerned with food safety and product quality. The OHVP has collaborated with the Center for Innovative Food Technology to write and implement a Greenhouse Good Agricultural Practices food safety protocol. This program emphasizes the prevention of microbial contamination of hydroponic greenhouse crops through the careful management of water, worker hygiene, packing and cooling. Interactive budgets and horticultural support may be found at www.oardc.ohio-state.edu/hydroponics. The Ohio Hydroponic Vegetable Program is a dynamic program that brings together the education, market research, business planning and individual assistance that greenhouse growers require to stay competitive in this global market. 3abusiness enterprises 3abusiness planning 3acooling 3acrops 3aeconomic sustainability 3aeducation 3afood safety 3agood agricultural practices 3agreenhouses 3agrowers 3ahorticulture 3ahydroponics 3ahygiene 3amarket analysis 3amicrobial contamination 3aproduct safety 3aprofits and margins 3avegetables 3awater management 3aGreat Lakes 3aOhio0 tActa horticulturae.g2004 Nov., , no. 659 p.41-45dInternational Society for Horticultural Sciencex0567-75727nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.actahort.org/books/659/659_3.htm3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02496naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092040001800119100001900137245010600156300001800262500001500280520115200295650002101447650001301468650002201481650001601503650001901519650001501538650002201553650001101575650001001586650001401596650002401610650001501634653002701649653002201676653002701698653002301725700001401748700001601762773010301778852000901881856007701890930003301967945001302000946001302013655001202026IND2059291920221123020636.0970830e199612  dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205929192DNAL7 a10.1021/jf960135h2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSrinivasan, M.10aSodium caseinate-stabilized emulsions: factors affecting coverage and composition of surface proteins  ap. 3807-3811.  a2019-12-04  aAs the concentration of caseinate in sodium caseinate-stabilized emulsions increased, the protein surface concentration increased.

Increasing the oil concentration from 10 to 30% (w/w) decreased the surface protein concentration from 3.7 +/- 0.3 to 1.4 +/- 0.04 mg/m2, but further increases in oil concentration had much less effect. A decrease in surface protein concentration was observed as the homogenization pressure increased from 34 to 136 bar, but higher pressures had no further effect. beta-Casein was adsorbed preferentially at the droplet surface in emulsions homogenized at pressures above 204 bar. Addition of calcium chloride to sodium caseinate solutions above 0.08% w/w resulted in formation of large casein particles/aggregates which adsorbed on to the droplet surface causing higher surface protein concentration. 3acalcium chloride 3apressure 3aprotein structure 3asoybean oil 3ahomogenization 3acaseinates 3amembrane proteins 3acasein 3awater 3aemulsions 3aprotein composition 3aadsorption 0aoil-in-water emulsions 0aoil concentratons 0aprotein concentrations 0achemical structure1 aSingh, H.1 aMunro, P.A.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g1996 Dec., v. 44, no. 12 p.3807-3811x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf960135h3Available from publisher's Web site  a19971001b19971008c00000000  aINDdGHK  aOther US 7aarticle02626naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003900111040001800150072000900168100002000177245010800197300001400305500006500319500002400384520091800408650001601326650001201342650001801354650000901372650001601381650001401397650002201411650001101433650002401444650001801468650001701486650003101503650001201534650003601546650002201582650003701604650003201641650002401673650001301697650003001710653001801740700002101758700002101779773009301800852000901893856008901902930003301991945002502024946001102049655001202060IND4421420220221122231314.0090605e20090601xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442142022DNAL7 a194809502pmid7 a10.1016/j.jbiotec.2009.03.0162doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aP1201 aLyko, Hildegard10aCoupled production in biorefineries--Combined use of biomass as a source of energy, fuels and materials  ap. 78-86.  aIn the special issue: Solar biofuels / edited by Olaf Kruse.  aIncludes references  aIn spite of high prices for fossil raw materials the production of biomass-based products is rarely economically successful today. Depending on the location feedstock prices are currently so high that products from renewable resources are not marketable when produced in existing process chains. Apart from the higher feedstock costs one reason is that at present no optimized production systems exist in contrast to the chemical and petrochemical industry where these systems have been established over the last decades. If we succeed in developing production systems modelled on those of petroleum refineries where we can provide a flexible coupled production of energy, fuels, materials and chemicals chances are good to enable a lastingly successful production on the basis of renewable resources. Based on examples of fat-based and sugar-based concepts ideas for platform oriented biorefineries are outlined. 3abiorefining 3abiomass 3acrop residues 3acorn 3agrain crops 3aoil crops 3abiotransformation 3asugars 3arenewable resources 3asuccinic acid 3abiosynthesis 2aBioelectric Energy Sources 2aBiomass 2aBiotechnologyxmethodsxtrends. 2aBiotransformation 2aConservation of Energy Resources 2aEnergy-Generating Resources 2aEthanolxmetabolism 2aGasoline 2aSuccinic Acidxmetabolism 0aoleochemicals1 aDeerberg, Görge1 aWeidner, Eckhard0 tJournal of biotechnology.g2009 June 1, v. 142, no. 1 p.78-86dElsevierx0168-16567nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jbiotec.2009.03.0163Available from publisher's Web site  a20090610b20090703c00000000  aINDdRHFe2009/06/10  aNon-US 7aarticle03083naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131072000900149100002000158245009800178300001800276500002400294500001500318520140500333650001701738650001601755650002001771650002201791650001201813650002201825650001301847650003101860650002601891650000901917650001401926650001801940650002601958650001301984650002201997650001702019650001702036650001802053653001502071653000902086653002702095700002102122700001802143700002502161700002602186700001802212773009602230852000902326856008902335930003302424945002502457946001102482655001202493IND4421421020221122220217.0090605e200910  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442142102DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodhyd.2008.12.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ4001 aLeón, Paula G.10aRheological characterization of deacylated/acylated gellan films carrying l-(+)-ascorbic acid  ap. 1660-1669.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aFilms developed for supporting l-(+)-ascorbic acid (AA), natural antioxidant for the protection of foods, were rheologically evaluated. A film was formulated by mixing gellan gum with its acylated form to attain a higher AA stability and lower non-enzymatic browning. The polymer mixture allowed obtaining a less rigid film, permitting the usage of a lower proportion of glycerol. Mechanical spectra of films evidenced solid-like materials provided the time scale of the observation was shorter than the lifetime of the physical cross-links involved. There was evidence for a shorter time of relaxation in the films stored at 33.3-57.7% of relative humidity, which influenced small deformation (linear range) measurements. Out of linear viscoelasticity a greater hardening effect was observed for A- and B-films and related to enhanced polymer interactions in gellan based films. Its increase with the moisture content may be a result of macromolecular association. Higher rigidity characterized gellan based films (A- and B-networks) at intermediate deformations, which may also lead to higher softening degree till rupture. A smaller hardening and softening degrees were observed for C- and D-systems. This can be ascribed to spatial hindering in the film network by acylated gellan chains, fact that worsened polymer interactions. Atomic force microscopy images reinforced rheological conclusions. 3acrosslinking 3adeformation 3aviscoelasticity 3aMaillard reaction 3atexture 3arelative humidity 3ahardness 3aphysicochemical properties 3amechanical properties 3agels 3aacylation 3awater content 3achemical interactions 3apolymers 3astress relaxation 3aedible films 3aantioxidants 3aascorbic acid 0agellan gum 0agums 0arheological properties1 aChillo, Stefania1 aConte, Amalia1 aGerschenson, Lía N.1 aDel Nobile, Matteo A.1 aRojas, Ana M.0 tFood hydrocolloids.g2009 Oct., v. 23, no. 7 p.1660-1669dElsevier Sciencex0268-005X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodhyd.2008.12.0083Available from publisher's Web site  a20090722b20090801c00000000  aINDd7CTe2009/07/08  aNon-US 7aarticle02313naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131072000900149100001700158245008600175300001800261500002400279500001500303520093500318650001901253650002301272650001201295650001501307650000901322650000701331650002701338650001901365650002301384650001001407653002401417653003701441653002601478700001601504700001501520700001801535700001501553773009601568852000901664856008901673930003301762945002501795946001101820655001201831IND4421420920221122220309.0090605e200910  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442142092DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodhyd.2008.12.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ5021 aSalvador, P.10aMicrostructure-function relationships of heat-induced gels of porcine haemoglobin  ap. 1654-1659.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThe purpose of this work was to use image analysis to study the microstructural properties of haemoglobin gels, with structural changes induced by pH conditions, and their correlations with physical properties such as texture and water holding capacity (WHC). Two types of networks showing great differences in the dimensions of the gel structure were obtained as influenced by pH. At pH<5.5 there was a shift from an aggregated to a fine-stranded gel type. Fractal dimension values revealed that more complex structures corresponded to softest and non-exudative gels. Lacunarity and pore size, which were used to study the pore distribution within the network, confirmed that softest gels with high WHC showed large number of small cavities. Finally, correlations between textural attributes, i.e. springiness and adhesiveness, and spatial variability, referred quantitatively to the degree of compactness, were also established. 3amicrostructure 3agelling properties 3atexture 3ahemoglobin 3agels 3apH 3awater holding capacity 3aheat treatment 3afractal dimensions 3aswine 0aphysical properties 0astructure function relationships 0afunctional properties1 aToldrà, M.1 aSaguer, E.1 aCarretero, C.1 aParés, D.0 tFood hydrocolloids.g2009 Oct., v. 23, no. 7 p.1654-1659dElsevier Sciencex0268-005X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodhyd.2008.12.0033Available from publisher's Web site  a20090722b20090801c00000000  aINDd7CTe2009/07/08  aNon-US 7aarticle03276naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131072000900149100001600158245009300174300001800267500002400285500001500309520185700324650001702181650001602198650002002214650002002234650001902254650000702273650001402280650002102294650002002315650001302335650002302348650001602371650001302387653002402400653002702424653002602451653002702477700001502504773009602519852000902615856008902624930003302713945002502746946001102771655001202782IND4421421720221122152950.0090605e200910  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442142172DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodhyd.2009.01.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ5001 aRinaudo, M.10aRheological behavior of binary and ternary mixtures of polysaccharides in aqueous medium  ap. 1720-1728.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThe rheological behavior of mixtures of xanthan with different galactomannans is examined to evaluate the influence of the structure of galactomannan and that of the mixture composition on the physical properties; the larger synergy is observed for locust bean gum in the presence of xanthan. It is also shown that pH has only a slight influence on the rheology down to pH=3.59; at lower pH, the G' modulus decreases significantly. Then, the behavior of xanthan-methylcellulose mixtures is studied, paying particular attention to the storage modulus (G') of the system, often equated to ''gel strength''. The modulus values for direct dissolution of the two polysaccharides in 0.1M NaCl show that xanthan and methylcellulose are incompatible. The rheological behavior observed is in agreement with DSC results which indicate that no specific interaction between the two polymers exists. However, upon increasing temperature, the modulus of methylcellulose increases substantially between 65 and 70^oC because of physical gelation and dominates the rheology of the mixtures. When temperature is decreased to 37^oC, the clear methylcellulose gel formed remains stable, still giving the main contribution to the overall rheology of the system. Finally, ternary systems are studied when xanthan is mixed with galactomannan and methylcellulose. In this case H-bonds involved in galactomannan-xanthan interaction break when temperature increases causing a decrease in rheological moduli which is then compensated by the gelation of methylcellulose giving an original large increase in moduli for the ternary systems. This can be interpreted as the presence of two independent but interpenetrating networks. The role of pH for these ternary systems is interesting: it is still dominated by methylcellulose and nearly independent of acidic pH (down to pH=1.8). 3agel strength 3atemperature 3amethylcellulose 3astorage modulus 3agalactomannans 3apH 3asynergism 3ahydrogen bonding 3alocust bean gum 3amixtures 3achemical structure 3axanthan gum 3agelation 0aphysical properties 0apolysaccharide synergy 0achemical interactions 0arheological properties1 aMoroni, A.0 tFood hydrocolloids.g2009 Oct., v. 23, no. 7 p.1720-1728dElsevier Sciencex0268-005X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodhyd.2009.01.0123Available from publisher's Web site  a20090722b20090801c00000000  aINDd7CTe2009/07/09  aNon-US 7aarticle02997naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131072000900149100001700158245010200175300001800277500002400295500001500319520137800334650002301712650002001735650001401755650002801769650001901797650002001816650001201836650001501848650001701863650001601880650001901896650001601915650002301931650000901954650002101963650001901984650001902003653002702022653002702049700001902076700001602095700002402111700001402135700001902149773009602168852000902264856008902273930003302362945002502395946001102420655001202431IND4421421620221122152922.0090605e200910  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442142162DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodhyd.2009.01.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ5041 aLu, Zhan-Hui10aEffect of amylose content and rice type on dynamic viscoelasticity of a composite rice starch gel  ap. 1712-1719.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aAmylose content is an important indicator to determine the utility of raw milled rice. Indica type rice with high amylose content is usually used for manufacturing rice noodles, while Japonica rice may be mixed partially to adjust the noodle texture. The effect of amylose and rice type on dynamic viscoelasticity of rice starch gel was investigated using a model starch composite in this study. The information will be helpful to control and obtain the required noodle texture by combination of different rice types. The results show that nonwaxy Indica and waxy Japonica rice starches in a composite mixture were incompatible and demonstrated their individual gelatinization behavior during heating. High amylose starch showed higher moduli and lower loss tangent values, as well as higher retrogradation rate. The starch gel made from Japonica rice starch showed a slow retrogradation rate even containing a similar amount of amylose to Indica starch. The storage modulus of the gel made from higher amylose rice was shown to be more independent of frequency. Not only amylose content but also chain length distribution in amylopectin affected the dynamic viscoelasticity of rice gel. Japonica rice starch, with fewer super-long chains in amylopectin, retrograded slower after gelatinization than Indica rice, thus the paste is too sticky for production of rice noodles. 3amodel food systems 3aviscoelasticity 3acultivars 3afood processing quality 3aretrogradation 3astorage modulus 3aamylose 3astickiness 3aOryza sativa 3arice starch 3agelatinization 3aamylopectin 3achemical structure 3agels 3afood composition 3aheat treatment 3aglutinous rice 0amodel starch composite 0arheological properties1 aSasaki, Tomoko1 aLi, Yong-Yu1 aYoshihashi, Tadashi1 aLi, Lide.1 aKohyama, Kaoru0 tFood hydrocolloids.g2009 Oct., v. 23, no. 7 p.1712-1719dElsevier Sciencex0268-005X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodhyd.2009.01.0093Available from publisher's Web site  a20090722b20090801c00000000  aINDd7CTe2009/07/09  aNon-US 7aarticle03531naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001500110245018100125300001400306500017300320500002400493520208500517650002102602650002202623650000902645650001202654650001002666650001402676650001302690650001402703650001802717650001402735650002102749650001002770650001002780650001102790650001702801650001002818651001102828700001702839700001502856773012002871852000902991856008503000655001203085IND4471602220221122112838.0130830s2013    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447160222DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMeland, M.10aManaging alternate bearing of 'opal' plum (Prunus domestica L.) trees with GA3 applications by increasing fruit size, and normalizing return bloom and yield in a nordic climate  ap. 61-66.  aPaper presented at the EUFRIN Thinning Working Group Symposia, held March 11, 2010 - March 9th, 2012, Catalonia, Spain, Wageningen, Netherlands and Ljubljana, Slovenia.  aIncludes references  aCrop load adjustments in European plum trees (Prunus domestica L.) require thinning either by hand, mechanical or chemical means to achieve marketable size, fruit quality and to overcome alternate bearing. Efficient tools for crop load management are highly desirable, since only a few chemical thinners are registered and hand thinning is labor intensive and costly. Gibberellic acid (GA3) was tested as a novel approach to regulate the crop load of the plum cultivar ‛Opal’ at Ullensvang, western Norway. The objective was to reduce flower bud induction in the “off-year” thus adjusting crop load the subsequent year. In 2008, an “off-year”, GA3 was applied to 9 year-old ‘Opal’ trees as a high volume spray to the point of run-off at 50 ppm or 100 ppm at either 5 weeks after full bloom or 10 weeks after full bloom, or on both dates and compared with untreated control trees. Trees were un-thinned the first year, but then thinned to commercial standard the following year. In the year of GA application, total yield was recorded and fruit quality evaluated. Return bloom, fruit set, yield and fruit quality were assessed the subsequent year. In general, there were no significant differences in crop load of all treated trees compared to untreated trees in the year of application (non-target crop). However, fruit weight increased slightly on those trees when GA3 was applied 5 weeks after full bloom compared to all other treatments and untreated trees. The following year (target crop) fruit set was significantly reduced for all GA3 treatments. The most effective application time was 5 weeks after full bloom. Before thinning, initial fruit set was greatest on untreated trees as well as on those trees treated with GA3 10 weeks after full bloom.Fruit weight and fruit colour were significantly better on trees with the least fruit set. GA3 applications had no effect on fruit firmness. It is concluded that GA3 is an effective tool for inhibiting flower bud induction in an “off-year” thus enabling crop load management the subsequent “on-year”. 3aPrunus domestica 3aalternate bearing 3abuds 3aclimate 3acolor 3acultivars 3afirmness 3aflowering 3afruit quality 3afruit set 3agibberellic acid 3alabor 3aplums 3arunoff 3aspray volume 3atrees 3aNorway1 aBirken, E.M.1 aKaiser, C.0 tActa horticulturae.g2013 July, , no. 998 p.61-66dInternational Society for Horticultural Sciencex0567-75727nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.actahort.org/books/998/998_6.htm3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle04831naa a2200781 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024002800133040001800161100002000179245013700199300001600336500002400352506007600376520230100452506003702753650002502790650001102815650001802826650002402844650002602868650002102894650001002915650001602925650001002941650001902951650001202970650001302982650001302995650001403008650003003022650002003052650001403072650002003086650001203106650001303118650004503131650003703176650003003213650002103243650002703264650003803291650001703329650002803346650003903374650003003413650001303443650003903456650003003495650005003525650004003575650002203615650002403637650003103661650002903692700002003721700002103741700002803762700002803790773010003818852000903918856007803927856003204005655001204037IND4393645520221207135213.0070729e200708  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439364552DNAL7 a175659712pmid7 aPMC27353172pmcid7 a10.1093/aob/mcm1022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFalcone, Andrea10aCytological Investigations of the Arabidopsis thaliana elo1 Mutant Give New Insights into Leaf Lateral Growth and Elongator Function  ap. 261-270.  aIncludes references  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND AND AIMS: Leaf growth is a complex developmental process controlled by genetic and environmental factors and is determined by a proliferation, expansion and maturation phase. Mutational analysis in Arabidopsis thaliana showed that leaf size and shape is dependent on cell division and cell expansion activity. An investigation was made at the cytophysiological and ultrastructural level of the elo1 mutant of Arabidopsis thaliana, which is defective in one of the components of the histone acetyl transferase Elongator complex and displays a distinct 'narrow leaves' phenotype, owing to a reduced cell number and no transition between petiole and lamina. Relative expression levels of three sucrose metabolism/transport-related genes were also investigated. The aim was to determine the physiological basis of leaf morphology in this mutant, by investigating the modulatory role of sucrose. METHODS: The elo1 mutant was taken as representative of all the elo mutations and investigated at cytophysiological level. A germination test and growth assays were performed on seedlings grown for 21 d at different sucrose concentrations. Leaf morphometric and ultrastructural features were also investigated by image analysis and electron microscopy, respectively. Finally, a quantitative PCR (qPCR) analysis was performed with three sucrose metabolism/transport-related genes that were investigated under different sucrose concentrations. KEY RESULTS ELO1: plants at high sucrose concentrations exhibited an enhancement of germination and inhibition of leaf growth as compared with wild-type plants. qPCR experiments with three sucrose metabolism/transport-related genes showed an interaction between sucrose availability and the elo1 mutation. Furthermore, electron microscopy analysis provided the first ultrastructural description of an elo mutant, which showed a hypotonic vacuole, alterations in the size of grana and starch grains in the chloroplasts, and the massive presence of Golgi vesicles in the cytoplasm. CONCLUSIONS: Based on the results obtained it is proposed that mechanisms producing carbon assimilates or importing sucrose could be affected in elo1 plants and could account for the observed differences, implying a role for Elongator in the regulation of these processes.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3acarbon 3acell division 3aelectron microscopy 3aenvironmental factors 3agene interaction 3agenes 3agermination 3agrana 3aimage analysis 3amutants 3amutation 3apetioles 3aphenotype 3apolymerase chain reaction 3aprocess control 3aseedlings 3astarch granules 3asucrose 3avacuoles 2aArabidopsisxphysiologyxultrastructure. 2aArabidopsis Proteinsxphysiology 2aCell Divisionxphysiology 2aCell Enlargement 2aExocytosisxphysiology 2aGene Expression Regulation, Plant 2aGenes, Plant 2aGerminationxphysiology 2aMicroscopy, Electron, Transmission 2aMorphogenesisxphysiology 2aMutation 2aPlant Leavesxgrowth & development 2aPolymerase Chain Reaction 2aProtein Serine-Threonine Kinasesxphysiology. 2aReceptors, Cell Surfacexphysiology 2aSeedsxphysiology 2aSucrosexmetabolism 2aThylakoidsxultrastructure 2aVacuolesxultrastructure1 aNelissen, Hilde1 aFleury, Delphine1 aVan Lijsebettens, Mieke1 aBitonti, Maria Beatrice0 tAnnals of botany.g2007 Aug., v. 100, no. 2 p.261-270dOxford University Pressx0305-73647nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/aob/mcm1023Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://aob.oupjournals.org/ 7aarticle01436naa a2200313 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001900110245013400129300001600263520049700279650003000776650002400806650002300830700002200853700001300875700002000888700001800908700001600926700001700942773008500959852000901044930003301053945001301086946001101099655001201110IND2206084320221122080735.0000728e20000112enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220608432DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShashkov, A.S.10aStructure of the O-chain polysaccharide of the lipopolysaccharide of Xanthomonas campestris pv. manihotis GSPB 2755 and GSPB 2364  ap. 235-239.  aThe O-chain polysaccharide of the lipopolysaccharide of Xanthomonas campestris pv. manihotis strains GSPB 2755 and GSPB 2364 was studied by sugar and methylation analyses and 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopy, including 2D COSY, TOCSY, NOESY, and H-detected 1H, 13C heteronuclear multiple-quantum coherence (HMQC) experiments.

Buffalo ovaries were collected from a local abattoir and preantral follicles were isolated through microdissection. Isolated preantral follicles were put either in collagen gel coated culture dish or embedded in a microdrop of collagen gel. The culture medium was TCM-199 fortified with fetal calf serum (10%), insulin transferin selenium solution (ITS, 1%), epidermal growth factor (EGF, 20ng/ml) and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH, 0.5μg/ml). Follicles were divided into three groups and cultured in the medium described above (group a, control), with addition of insulin like growth factor (IGF-I, 100ng/ml, group b), or with addition of IGF-I and basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF, 10ng/ml, group c). Preantral follicles were incubated at 38.5°C in 5% CO₂ and maximum humidity. Culture medium was replenished after every 72h and spent medium was stored at -30°C for hormone analysis. We found that the extracellular matrix of collagen gel maintained follicle viability and growth by providing surface interaction and increasing attachment of follicles. Preantral follicles embedded in collagen gel droplets had better antrum formation and development as compared to the whole surface coated culture method. Follicles cultured with IGF-I on collagen gel matrix showed a significantly (P <0.05) higher survival rate and larger mean diameter of follicles on day 10 of culture with improved growth and mucification as compared to the control group. However, follicles cultured in the combination of IGF-I with bFGF had decreased survival rate and smaller mean follicles diameter than the IGF-I group (b). Progesterone (P₄) accumulation was greater on day 9 of culture in follicles cultured in IGF-I as compared to control; whereas, P₄ was markedly decreased in the combination of IGF-I with bFGF. Follicles of the control group could survive for up to 10-15 days before degenerating, but follicles cultured with growth factors were able to survive up to 20 days and showed signs of early antrum formation. In summary, we have shown that collagen gel was a novel and efficacious 3D microenvironment for the extended culture of buffalo preantral follicles. Supplementation of culture medium with growth factors was found to be essential for antrum formation. 3aviability 3ainsulin-like growth factor I 3afollicular development 3abuffaloes 3ain vitro culture 3aovarian follicles 3amorphogenesis 3asteroidogenesis 3acollagen 3afibroblast growth factor 2 3aassisted reproductive technologies 3agels 3aprogesterone 3ain vitro studies 3adroplets 3aculture media 3atechnology 2aAnimals 2aBuffaloesxphysiology 2aCell Culture Techniquesxveterinary 2aCollagenxchemistry 2aCulture Mediaxchemistry 2aFemale 2aFibroblast Growth Factorsxpharmacology 2aInsulin-Like Growth Factor Ixpharmacology 2aOvarian Folliclexdrug effectsxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aProgesteronexmetabolism 2aStaining and Labeling 0amethodology 0anew technology 0athree-dimensional collagen gel culture system 0apreantral follicles 0anew methods 0agrowth factors1 aDubey, Pawan K.1 aMeur, S.K.0 tAnimal reproduction science.g2009 Aug., v. 114, no. 1-3 p.115-124dElsevier Sciencex0378-43207nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.anireprosci.2008.09.0093Available from publisher's Web site  a20090722b20090801c00000000  aINDd4CTe2009/06/30  aNon-US 7aarticle01973naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001300150245007100163300001800234520082700252650002601079650001301105650001701118650001101135650000901146650002901155650001401184650000901198650001401207650001001221651002101231700001801252700001801270700001601288700002101304700001801325773017201343856005101515852000901566655001201575IND60411434520221122061035.0150925e201505  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6041143452DNAL7 a10.4315/0362-028X.JFP-14-4932doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCho, Ara10aLow Prevalence of Clostridium difficile in Slaughter Pigs in Korea  ap. 1034-1036.  aClostridium difficile is an important cause of enteric disease in humans and animals. The prevalence of C. difficile infection is increasing, and the bacterium is frequently found in meat products, suggesting the possibility of animal-to-human transmission. Therefore, food animals must be assessed for their role as reservoirs of C. difficile. In this study, C. difficile was isolated from 2 (0.3%) of 659 slaughtered pigs in Korea. Both isolates were characterized as ribotype 078 and were multidrug resistant. The low occurrence suggests only a limited risk of C. difficile transmission from porcine food products; however, C. difficile ribotype 078 is an important pathogen in both pigs and humans, and further studies are necessary to investigate the occurrence of C. difficile in retail meats and other food animals. 3aClostridium difficile 3abacteria 3afood animals 3ahumans 3ameat 3amultiple drug resistance 3apathogens 3arisk 3aslaughter 3aswine 3aKorean Peninsula1 aByun, Jae-Won1 aKim, Jong Wan1 aOh, Sang-Ik1 aLee, Myoung-Heon1 aKim, Ha-Young0 tJournal of food protection.g2015 May, v. 78, no. 5 p.1034-1036dInternational Association of Milk, Food, and Environmental Sanitarians.wJournal:2024x0362-028X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.4315/0362-028X.JFP-14-493  aDNAL 7aarticle02613naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001400110245012200124300001600246500012500262500002400387520133600411650001001747650001401757650002501771650001801796650001101814650001301825650001501838650001601853650001001869650001301879651002101892700001401913700001501927700001501942700001501957700001401972773012201986852000902108856008602117655001202203IND4471673620221122061006.0130830s2013    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447167362DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSon, J.Y.10aRelationship between seed formation and fruit characteristics in new persimmon cultivars, 'Jamisi' and 'Migamjosaeng'  ap. 189-192.  aPaper presented at the V International Symposium on Persimmon, held October 20 - 26, 2012, Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.  aIncludes references  aNew persimmon cultivars, ‘Jamisi’ and ‘Migamjosaeng’, have recently been released in Korea. Since their fruits have the pollination variant non-astringent trait, the seeds inevitably affect fruit quality. In this study, relationship between seed formation and fruit characteristics of ‘Migamjosaeng’, ‘Jamisi’ and ‘Nishimura-wase’ (control) was evaluated in three orchards with different cultural environments in Jinju, Changwon, and Gimhae districts, Gyeongnam Province. The largest variance of fruit weight was found in ‘Migamjosaeng’, as affected by different cultural conditions. Although difference of seed number was not great, de-astringency rate was markedly lower in ‘Migamjosaeng’. When a fruit contained 3 to 4 seeds, de-astringency rate was 93 and 94% in ‘Jamisi’ and ‘Nishimura-wase’, respectively, while it was 56.3% in ‘Migamjosaeng’. The seed number per fruit was significantly related to the degree of de-astringency. Skin color was related to seed numbers for the two new cultivars, suggesting that increasing seeds of fruits in the cultivars could increase coloration as well as de-astringency. In conclusion, since de-astringency rate could be less in the new cultivars, especially in ‘Migamjosaeng’, careful management involving better pollination should be applied. 3acolor 3acultivars 3acultural environment 3afruit quality 3afruits 3aorchards 3apersimmons 3apollination 3aseeds 3avariance 3aKorean Peninsula1 aKim, S.C.1 aPark, Y.O.1 aChoi, T.M.1 aHong, K.P.1 aRho, C.W.0 tActa horticulturae.g2013 June, , no. 996 p.189-192dInternational Society for Horticultural Sciencex0567-75727nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.actahort.org/books/996/996_25.htm3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02875naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002800092040001800120100002000138245009900158300001400257500002400271520154500295650002001840650001501860650001901875650001801894650002501912650001601937650000901953650001501962650000801977650001701985650000702002650001302009650001702022650001402039650001302053650001702066650001102083650002002094650001802114700002102132700002102153773014402174852000902318856007802327655001202405IND4476343620221122061155.0140131s2003    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447634362DNAL7 a 10.1002/jsfa.12532doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMorzel, Martine10aEvaluation of slaughtering methods for turbot with respect to animal welfare and flesh quality  ap. 19-28.  aIncludes references  aAfter elaborating a suitable scheme to assess consciousness/unconsciousness of turbot, the effects on fish welfare of commercial and experimental slaughtering techniques were evaluated. Strong adverse reactions and slow loss of clinical reflexes were observed when fish were slaughtered by bleeding without prior anaesthesia. The efficiency of electricity (150 V for 2 s followed by 25 V for 5 min) as a stunning and killing technique was dependent on the current frequency and mode of administration, ie whether the electrical discharge was applied to the head only or throughout the whole body. Finally, percussion of the head with a mechanical device resulted in immediate and permanent loss of all responses and reflexes in all fish tested. Three methods were selected as a result of the preliminary tests (bleeding in ice slurry, whole-body electrical treatment and percussion), and their influence on flesh quality was studied over a 9 day period. Fish killed by percussion were characterised by a higher pH and higher water content in the very early stage of post mortem storage, but also by a much delayed rigor mortis. In contrast, fish killed by electricity entered most rapidly into rigor mortis; their flesh was significantly softer (p < 0.05) throughout the entire storage time and was also redder and darker, as indicated by higher a* values (p < 0.001) and lower L* values (p < 0.01) respectively. It is suggested that automated percussion is a suitably humane method for the slaughter of farmed turbot. 3aadverse effects 3aanesthesia 3aanimal welfare 3aconsciousness 3aelectrical treatment 3aelectricity 3ahead 3ahemorrhage 3aice 3ameat quality 3apH 3areflexes 3arigor mortis 3aslaughter 3aslurries 3astorage time 3aturbot 3aunconsciousness 3awater content1 aSohier, Delphine1 aVis, Hans Van de0 tJournal of the science of food and agriculture.g2003 Jan. 1, v. 83, no. 1 p.19-28dPublished for SCI by John Wiley & Sonsx0022-51427nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/ 10.1002/jsfa.12533Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02901naa a2200625 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004300111040001800154072000900172072000900181072000900190100003300199245011200232300001600344500002400360520110800384650001001492650001201502650002001514650002101534650003101555650001601586650002301602650002501625650001101650650001401661650001401675650001501689650001801704650001901722650001201741650003301753650001601786650001301802650001201815650002301827650001101850650002201861650002601883650001201909650001701921651001101938700001601949700002101965773010601986852000902092856009302101930003302194945002502227946001102252655001202263IND4421436020221122061137.0090605e200908  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442143602DNAL7 a189303602pmid7 a10.1016/j.anireprosci.2008.09.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL210 0aL600 0aL3001 aDe Santiago-Miramontes, M.A.10aBody condition is associated with a shorter breeding season and reduced ovulation rate in subtropical goats  ap. 175-182.  aIncludes references  aTo determine the effect of body condition on the characteristics of the breeding season in female goats from subtropical Mexico, does in either greater- or lesser-body condition (n =20/group) were monitored for the expression of estrous behavior, ovulation and ovulation rate between June and April.

In conclusion, female goats in lesser body condition have a shorter breeding season, more abnormal estrous cycles, and fewer ovulations than does in greater body condition. 3agoats 3afemales 3abreeding season 3afemale fertility 3afemale reproductive system 3aperiodicity 3aseasonal variation 3aseasonal development 3aestrus 3aovulation 3afrequency 3asubtropics 3ahealth status 3abody condition 2aAnimals 2aBody Compositionxphysiology 2aBody Weight 2aBreeding 2aClimate 2aEstrusxphysiology 2aFemale 2aGoatsxphysiology 2aOvulationxphysiology 2aSeasons 2aTime Factors 3aMexico1 aMalpaux, B.1 aDelgadillo, J.A.0 tAnimal reproduction science.g2009 Aug., v. 114, no. 1-3 p.175-182dElsevier Sciencex0378-43207nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.anireprosci.2008.09.0013Available from publisher's Web site  a20090722b20090801c00000000  aINDd4CTe2009/06/30  aNon-US 7aarticle02440naa a2200313 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002800092040001800120100002800138245015800166300001300324500002400337520137900361650001101740650001101751650001401762650002301776650002601799650000901825650001701834650001001851700002301861773014301884852000902027856007802036655001202114IND4476343420221122061215.0140131s2003    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447634342DNAL7 a 10.1002/jsfa.12732doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFaris, Moez Al-Islam E.10aStudy of the effect of using different levels of tahinah (sesame butter) on the protein digestibility-corrected amino acid score (PDCAAS) of chickpea dip  ap. 7-12.  aIncludes references  aThis study was conducted to investigate the effect of using different proportions of tahinah (0–25%) on the protein digestibility-corrected amino acid score (PDCAAS) of chickpea dip and to evaluate this parameter when chickpea dip is consumed with wheat bread. Protein quality was evaluated using the methods of amino acid score and true protein digestibility in weanling Sprague–Dawley rats. The levels of tahinah that provided the best true protein digestibility and protein digestibility-corrected amino acid score were 20 and 25%. Values of true protein digestibility were significantly higher (P ≤ 0.05) than for the other types of chickpea dip (0.87 and 0.88 respectively). The consumption of wheat bread with chickpea dip led to a marked improvement in the true protein digestibility of the protein mixture (0.90); however, the protein digestibility-corrected amino acid score did not change in the same manner owing to the relatively low amino acid score. It can be concluded that the addition of tahinah to chickpea led to an increase in the protein digestibility-corrected amino acid score of chickpea dip (based on laboratory rat requirements for essential amino acids) and that the consumption of chickpea dip with bread led to an improvement in the protein digestibility of chickpea dip but not in the protein digestibility-corrected amino acid score. 3abreads 3abutter 3achickpeas 3adigestible protein 3aessential amino acids 3arats 3atrue protein 3awheat1 aTakruri,  Hamed R.0 tJournal of the science of food and agriculture.g2003 Jan. 1, v. 83, no. 1 p.7-12dPublished for SCI by John Wiley & Sonsx0022-51427nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/ 10.1002/jsfa.12733Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02551naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002800092040001800120100002500138245010300163300001400266500002400280520144400304650000801748650001701756650001201773650001601785650001601801650001001817650000901827650001401836650001901850650001401869650002301883650001601906700002401922773014401946852000902090856007802099655001202177IND4476343820221122061030.0140131s2003    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447634382DNAL7 a 10.1002/jsfa.12782doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAl-Ismail, Khalid M.10aEffect of processing and storage of brined white (Nabulsi) cheese on fat and cholesterol oxidation  ap. 39-43.  aIncludes references  aBrined white (Nabulsi) cheese was studied for cholesterol oxidation and for oxidative and hydrolytic rancidities during cheese processing, during storage in closed transparent and light-protected glass jars at room temperature for 3, 6 and 9 months and during storage on an open tray exposed to atmospheric air and light for 1, 2 and 3 weeks. The peroxide value (PV), free fatty acid (FFA) content and 7-ketocholesterol level were determined. The cheese processing steps (curd formation, salting and boiling in brine) had no significant effect on PV, FFAs and 7-ketocholesterol. However, the storage conditions had a significant effect (p ≤ 0.5) on these parameters. Peroxides were not detected or were very low in the freshly boiled cheese, while the FFA content was 2.9 g kg(−1). The PV and FFA content increased to approximately 5 meq kg(−1) and 11 g kg(−1) respectively after 9 months of storage in transparent or light-protected jars. The 7-ketocholesterol level was 1.2 µg g(−1) in the freshly boiled cheese and reached maximum values of 2.3 and 5.2 µg g(−1) after 9 months of storage in light-protected and transparent jars respectively.

Homofucan sulfate from C. filum was shown to contain poly-alpha-(1 to 3)-fucopyranoside backbone with a high degree of branching, mainly of alpha-(1 to 2)-linked single units. Some fucopyranose residues are sulfated at O-4 (mainly) and O-2 positions. Some alpha-(1 to 3)-linked fucose residues were shown by NMR to be 2-O-acetylated. The (1)H and (13)C NMR spectra of desulfated, deacetylated fucan were completely assigned. The spectral data obtained correspond to a quasiregular polysaccharide structure with a branched hexasaccharide repeating unit.

It has the property of high yield, big fruit, and bearing a lot of male flowers, which makes it of relevant value both commercially and in breeding. Nevertheless, according to our knowledge it is probably not a PCNA type persimmon, so attempts were made to make clear its origin and astringent type. Its soluble tannin content and tannin cell size were compared with cultivars whose astringent types were already known. Results showed it was neither a PCNA nor a pollination-constant astringent (PCA) type persimmon. We also observed its seeds distribution and the influence of the seeds to the fruits’ deastringency, and confirmed that it was a pollination-variant astringent (PVA) type persimmon. Several molecular markers including RAPD (Randomly Amplified Polymorphic DNA), ISSR (Inter-simple sequence repeat), IRAP (Inter-retrotransposon amplified polymorphism), REMAP (Retrotransposon- microsatellite amplified polymorphism), SSAP (Sequence-specific amplified polymorphism) and AFLP (Amplified fragment length polymorphism) were used or developed in our research group on ‘Huashi 1’; results showed it has a closer relationship to persimmon originated in Japan, but it is distant from persimmon originated in China. In conclusion, ‘Huashi 1’ was classified as a PVA type persimmon originated in Japan and it had big potential in persimmon breeding. 3aamplified fragment length polymorphism 3abreeding 3acultivars 3afruits 3agenetic markers 3amale flowers 3amicrosatellite repeats 3apersimmons 3arandom amplified polymorphic DNA technique 3aseeds 3aChina 3aJapan1 aDu, X.1 aZhang, Q.1 aGuo, D.1 aLuo, Z.0 tActa horticulturae.g2013 June, , no. 996 p.193-198dInternational Society for Horticultural Sciencex0567-75727nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.actahort.org/books/996/996_26.htm3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle01884naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001400110245009700124300001600221500012500237500002400362520075700386650001401143650002101157650002201178650001401200650002701214651001001241700001101251700001501262700001301277700001301290700001401303773012201317852000901439856008601448655001201534IND4471674120221122051426.0130830s2013    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447167412DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Z.10aAnalysis of germplasm resources and genetic diversity of Diospyros L. from eastern Guangdong  ap. 219-224.  aPaper presented at the V International Symposium on Persimmon, held October 20 - 26, 2012, Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.  aIncludes references  aWe studied the germplasm resources and genetic diversity of Diospyros L.

The sprouting conditions of mung bean seeds provide optimal conditions of temperature and relative humidity for any potential pathogenic contaminant on the seeds to grow. The lack of a kill step postsprouting is a major safety concern. Thus, the use of a kill step on the seeds prior to a sprouting step would enhance the safety of fresh sprouts. The objective of this work was to evaluate the effectiveness of the combined thermal and chlorine dioxide gas (3.5 mg/liter of air) treatment with mechanical mixing (tumbling) to eliminate Salmonella on artificially inoculated mung bean seeds. Although no viable Salmonella was recovered from seeds treated in hot water at 60Â°C for 2 h, these treated seeds failed to germinate. Dry heat treatments (55, 60, or 70Â°C) for up to 8 h reduced Salmonella populations in excess of 3 log CFU/g. The use of tumbling, while treating the seeds, resulted in up to 1.6 log CFU/g reduction in Salmonella populations compared with no tumbling. Dry heat treatment at 65Â°C for 18 h with tumbling resulted in a complete inactivation of Salmonella populations on inoculated seeds with low inoculum levels (2.83 log CFU/g) as compared with high inoculum levels (4.75 log CFU/g). The increased reductions in pathogenic populations on the seeds with the use of tumbling could be attributed to increased uniformity of heat transfer and exposure to chlorine dioxide gas. All treated seeds were capable of germinating, as well as the nontreated controls. These results suggest that this combined treatment would be a viable process for enhancing the safety of fresh sprouts. 3aSalmonella Montevideo 3aair 3achlorine dioxide 3aheat transfer 3aheat treatment 3ainoculum 3amixing 3amung beans 3arelative humidity 3aseeds 3asprouting 3atemperature1 aBurke, Angela0 tJournal of food protection.g2015 May, v. 78, no. 5 p.868-872dInternational Association of Milk, Food, and Environmental Sanitarians.wJournal:2024x0362-028X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.4315/0362-028X.JFP-14-422  aDNAL 7aarticle03445naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002800111040001800139100001600157245008700173300001800260500002400278500001500302520193400317650002002251650002802271650002202299650002602321650002202347650000902369650001702378650000802395650000702403650001902410650002102429650001002450650001802460650001102478650004102489650001302530650003102543650003502574650002002609650002002629650003402649653002402683700001702707773011602724852000902840856007802849655001202927IND4428181720221122035517.0091106e200911  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442818172DNAL7 a197266332pmid7 a10.1093/jxb/erp2732doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSharp, R.G.10aVariability among species in the apoplastic pH signalling response to drying soils  ap. 4363-4370.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aAfter the imposition of soil drying treatments, an elevation of xylem sap pH is one of the earliest observable responses in many herbaceous model plant species. It is theorized that alkalization of sap results in a concurrent elevation in abscisic acid (ABA) concentration delivered to transpiring tissues by preventing Henderson-Hasselbalch-regulated partitioning between the apoplast and symplast. However, here it is demonstrated that the sap alkalzation response to soil drying is far from universal in higher plant species. Tests were conducted to determine how universal the pH response to drying soil was in a range of perennial species from a diverse range of plant families. The response was not found in the majority of the 22 species tested. Four species exhibited significant increases in pH, but the majority showed no significant change in xylem sap pH. There was no evolutionary relationship between the species that showed alkalization under drought stress. However, the species that alkalized sap also exhibited good control over internal water status and were the most isohydric species of those tested. None of the species exhibiting anisohydric responses alkalized xylem sap under drought stress. Regardless of alkalization response, plants still retain the ability to respond to changes in xylem sap pH when manipulated by alkaline buffer foliar sprays. This finding indicates that plants have conserved the ability to respond to changes in xylem pH and redistribute ABA, even if they do not currently utilize the mechanism when exposed to drought stress. It was found in Buddleja davidii, Euonymus fortunei, and Hydrangea serrata that the xylem sap pH response to water deficits mirrored the natural pH changes that occur as sap is transported to the leaves, indicating that plants need to be able to have naturally occurring alkalization processes in place for them to be up-regulated under drought stress. 3afoliar spraying 3ainterspecific variation 3aEuonymus fortunei 3aHydrangea macrophylla 3aherbaceous plants 3asoil 3awater stress 3asap 3apH 3asoil treatment 3aBuddleja davidii 3axylem 3aabscisic acid 3aleaves 2aAbscisic Acidxanalysisxmetabolism. 2aDroughts 2aHydrogen-Ion Concentration 2aPlantsxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aSoilxanalysis. 2aWaterxanalysis 2aXylemxchemistryxmetabolism. 0aspecies differences1 aDavies, W.J.0 tJournal of experimental botany.g2009 Nov., v. 60, no. 15 p.4363-4370dOxford University Pressx0022-09577nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jxb/erp2733Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02936naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002100145245008400166300001600250500002400266520181800290650002902108650001202137650002602149650001202175650001502187650002002202650001902222650001102241650001202252650002102264700001802285700001302303700001702316700001402333700001902347700001802366773008502384852000902469856004802478655001202526IND4417090120221122035613.0090228e200902  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441709012DNAL7 a10.1007/s10021-008-9218-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCunningham, S C.12aA Robust Technique for Mapping Vegetation Condition Across a Major River System  ap. 207-219.  aIncludes references  aEcologists need to develop tools that allow characterization of vegetation condition over scales that are pertinent to species' persistence and appropriate for management actions. Our study shows that stand condition can be mapped accurately over the floodplain of a major river system (ca 100,000 ha of forest over 1600 km of river)--the Murray River in southeastern Australia. It demonstrates the value of using quantitative ground surveys in conjunction with remotely sensed data to model vegetation condition over very large spatial domains. A comparison of four modelling methods found that stand condition was best modelled using the multivariate adaptive regression spline (MARS) method (R ² = 0.85), although there was little difference among the methods (R ² = 0.77-0.85). However, a subsequent validation survey of condition at new locations showed that use of artificial neural networks had substantially higher predictive power (R ² = 0.78) than the MARS model (R ² = 0.28). This discrepancy demonstrates the value of using several modelling approaches to determine relationships among vegetation responses and environmental variables, and stresses the importance of validating ecological models with predictive surveys conducted after model building. The artificial neural network was used to produce a stand condition map for the whole floodplain, which predicted that only 30% of the area containing Eucalyptus camaldulensis stands is currently in good condition. There is a downstream decline in stand condition, which is related to more extreme declines in flooding, due to water harvesting, and drier climate found in the Lower Murray region. Rigorous surveying and modelling approaches, such as those used here, are necessary if vegetation health is to be effectively monitored and managed. 3aEucalyptus camaldulensis 3aclimate 3aenvironmental factors 3aforests 3aharvesting 3aneural networks 3aremote sensing 3arivers 3asurveys 3awater harvesting1 aMac Nally, R.1 aRead, J.1 aBaker, P.

Thus, novel surveillance methodologies to detect B. anthracis on adulterated foods are important for bioterrorism preparedness. We describe the development of a phage-based bioluminescence assay for the detection of B. anthracis on deliberately contaminated foods. We previously engineered the B. anthracis phage W beta with genes encoding bacterial luciferase (luxA and luxB) to create a "light-tagged" reporter (W Î²::luxAB) that is able to rapidly detect B. anthracis by transducing a bioluminescent signal response. Here, we investigate the ability of W Î²::luxAB to detect B. anthracis Sterne, an attenuated select agent strain, in inoculated food (ground beef) and milk (2%, baby formula, and half and half) matrices after incubation with spores for 72 h at 4Â°C as per AOAC testing guidelines. The majority of B. anthracis bacilli remained in spore form, and thus were potentially infectious, within each of the liquid matrices for 14 days. Detection limits were 80 CFU/ml after 7 h of enrichment; sensitivity of detection increased to 8 CFU/ml when enrichment was extended to 16 h. The limit of detection in ground beef was 3.2 x 10(3) CFU/g after 7 h of enrichment, improving to 3.2 x 10(2) CFU/g after 16 h. Because the time to result is rapid and minimal processing is required, and because gastrointestinal anthrax can be fatal, the reporter technology displays promise for the protection of our food supply following a deliberate release of this priority pathogen. 3aBacillus anthracis 3aadulterated products 3aanthrax 3abacteriophages 3abioluminescence 3abioterrorism 3adetection limit 3afood availability 3afood contamination 3afood matrix 3agastrointestinal system 3agenes 3aground beef 3aguidelines 3aheat 3aingestion 3aluciferase 3amilk 3amonitoring 3apathogens 3arapid methods 3aspores1 aVandamm, Joshua P.1 aMolineux, Ian J.1 aSchofield, David A.0 tJournal of food protection.g2015 May, v. 78, no. 5 p.963-968dInternational Association of Milk, Food, and Environmental Sanitarians.wJournal:2024x0362-028X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.4315/0362-028X.JFP-14-534  aDNAL 7aarticle02774naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100001600171245015500187300001600342500002400358520102200382650001301404650001001417650001601427650001401443650001201457650001401469650001401483650001001497650001101507650002101518650002401539650006101563650004801624650001801672650001601690650003401706650002801740650002101768650002901789650002901818650005101847650004901898650003801947650002201985650001302007700002102020700001802041773009702059852000902156856005502165655001202220IND4445769920221122035549.0101126e201011  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444576992DNAL7 a208072152pmid7 a10.1111/j.1365-313X.2010.04349.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZouhar, Jan10aFunctional specialization within the vacuolar sorting receptor family: VSR1, VSR3 and VSR4 sort vacuolar storage cargo in seeds and vegetative tissues  ap. 577-588.  aIncludes references  aTwo different gene families have been proposed to act as sorting receptors for vacuolar storage cargo in plants: the vacuolar sorting receptors (VSRs) and the receptor homology‐transmembrane‐RING H2 domain proteins (RMRs). However, functional data on these genes is scarce and the identity of the sorting receptor for storage proteins remains controversial. Through a genetic screen we have identified the mtv2 mutant, which is defective in vacuolar transport of the storage cargo VAC2 in shoot apices. Map‐based cloning revealed that mtv2 is a loss of function allele of the VSR4 gene. We show that VSR1, VSR3 and VSR4, but not the remaining VSRs or RMRs, participate in vacuolar sorting of VAC2 in vegetative tissues, and 12S globulins and 2S albumins in seeds, an activity that is essential for seedling germination vigor. Finally, we demonstrate that the functional diversification in the VSR family results from divergent expression patterns and also from distinct sorting activities of the family members. 3aalbumins 3agenes 3agermination 3aglobulins 3amutants 3areceptors 3aseedlings 3aseeds 3ashoots 3astorage proteins 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aArabidopsisxgeneticsxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aArabidopsis Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aBase Sequence 2aGermination 2aMembrane Proteinsxmetabolism 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aMultigene Family 2aPlant Leavesxmetabolism 2aPlant Shootsxmetabolism 2aReceptors, Cytoplasmic and Nuclearxmetabolism 2aRecombinant Fusion Proteinsxdiagnostic use. 2aSeed Storage Proteinsxmetabolism 2aSeedsxmetabolism 2aVacuoles1 aMuñoz, Alfonso.1 aRojo, Enrique0 tplant journal.g2010 Nov., v. 64, no. 4 p.577-588dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0960-74127nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-313X.2010.04349.x 7aarticle03545naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245016900170300001600339520211000355650002802465650000902493650002602502650003002528650001102558650001902569650001202588650001602600650001902616650002302635650001102658650002802669650001902697650001102716650001102727650001202738650002102750650001302771700002302784700002502807700002502832773017002857856005103027852000903078655001203087IND60411433020221122031748.0150925s2015    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6041143302DNAL7 a10.4315/0362-028X.JFP-14-5032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKing, Amanda M.10aImpact of Clean-Label Antimicrobials and Nitrite Derived from Natural Sources on the Outgrowth of Clostridium perfringens during Cooling of Deli-Style Turkey Breast  ap. 946-953.  aOrganic acids and sodium nitrite have long been shown to provide antimicrobial activity during chilling of cured meat products. However, neither purified organic acids nor NaNO2 is permitted in products labeled natural and both are generally avoided in clean-label formulations; efficacy of their replacement is not well understood. Natural and clean-label antimicrobial alternatives were evaluated in both uncured and in alternative cured (a process that uses natural sources of nitrite) deli-style turkey breast to determine inhibition of Clostridium perfringens outgrowth during 15 h of chilling. Ten treatments of ground turkey breast (76% moisture, 1.2% salt) included a control and four antimicrobials: 1.0% tropical fruit extract, 0.7% dried vinegar, 1.0% cultured sugar vinegar blend, and 2.0% lemon-vinegar blend. Each treatment was formulated without (uncured) and with nitrite (PCN; 50 ppm of NaNO2 from cultured celery juice powder). Treatments were inoculated with C. perfringens spores (three-strain mixture) to yield 2.5 log CFU/g. Individual 50-g portions were vacuum packaged, cooked to 71.1 degrees C, and chilled from 54.4 to 26.7 degrees C in 5 h and from 26.7 to 7.2 degrees C in an additional 10 h. Triplicate samples were assayed for growth of C. perfringens at predetermined intervals by plating on tryptose-sulfite-cycloserine agar. Uncured control and PCN-only treatments allowed for 4.6- and 4.2-log increases at 15 h, respectively, and although all antimicrobial treatments allowed less outgrowth than uncured and PCN, the degree of inhibition varied. The 1.0% fruit extract and 1.0% cultured sugar vinegar blend were effective at controlling populations at or below initial levels, whether or not PCN was included. Without PCN, 0.7% dried vinegar and 2.0% lemon-vinegar blend allowed for 2.0- and 2.5-log increases, respectively, and similar to 1.5-log increases with PCN. Results suggest using clean-label antimicrobials can provide for safe cooling following the study parameters, and greater inhibition of C. perfringens may exist when antimicrobials are used with nitrite. 3aClostridium perfringens 3aagar 3aanti-infective agents 3aanti-infective properties 3acelery 3acold treatment 3acooling 3acured meats 3afruit extracts 3aground turkey meat 3ajuices 3aorganic acids and salts 3asodium nitrite 3aspores 3asugars 3aturkeys 3avacuum packaging 3avinegars1 aGlass, Kathleen A.1 aMilkowski, Andrew L.1 aSindelar, Jeffrey J.0 tJournal of food protection.g2015 May, v. 78, no. 5 p.946-953dInternational Association of Milk, Food, and Environmental Sanitarians.wJournal:2024x0362-028X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.4315/0362-028X.JFP-14-503  aDNAL 7aarticle04726naa a2200673 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127072000900145072000900154072000900163100001600172245009000188300001600278500002400294500001500318520285800333650001903191650001003210650002103220650002603241650001203267650002103279650001403300650002203314650001603336650001303352650002303365650001703388650002303405650001403428650002503442650002103467650001203488650002403500650002303524650001903547651001003566653002603576653001903602653002503621700001703646700001603663700002203679700001503701700001703716700001903733700001503752700001603767773009403783852000903877856008503886930003303971945002504004946001104029655001204040IND4421433220221122005230.0090605e20090626xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442143322DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fcr.2009.01.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF200 0aF120 0aE2001 aThapa, D.B.10aIdentifying superior wheat cultivars in participatory research on resource poor farms  ap. 124-130.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aImproving livelihood of resource poor farmers is an important goal of wheat research in developing countries. Although remarkable success has been achieved to date in developing widely adapted wheat cultivars, many resource poor farmers in marginal areas in developing world have not benefited. Participatory research could greatly enhance identifying cultivars according to the choice of the poor farmers. This study was conducted to examine how farmers' selection criteria could assist breeders in identifying superior wheat cultivars, and determine if a new statistical analysis tool, GGE biplot, could be effectively used in selection of improved cultivar based on quantitative (grain yield) and qualitative data (farmers' preference score). The field experiments were conducted in 3 years (2003-2005) in three mid-hill districts in the central Nepal involving resource poor wheat farmers. Sixteen wheat genotypes, including a long-term and a current commercial cultivar, were used in the study. Data were collected on agronomic traits considered important by the participating farmers. These included days to heading and maturity, plant height, effective tiller number, spike length, kernel per spike, 1000-kernel weight and grain yield. Farmers also qualitatively scored each genotype for multiple traits based on their preference. In general, the farmers used the same traits in selecting a superior cultivar that are used by breeders. However, relative importance of different traits differed, not necessarily following in line with the breeder preference. The cultivar superiority based on quantitative agronomic data (breeders' criteria) and qualitative preference scores (farmers' criteria) often showed synergies, however, there were differences as well. This indicates farmers' ability to choose superior cultivars based on qualitative observation compared to tedious quantitative data recording in the on-station testing. In the first year, a greater number of farmers selected improved check as a better choice than recent advanced breeding lines. In the 2nd and 3rd years, the farmers preferred genotypes other than the checks. This underlines the importance of testing of advanced materials in farmers' fields in multiple years. Principal component analysis using GGE-biplot was useful in identifying superior genotypes based on both quantitative and qualitative data recorded across environments. This approach could be useful in analyzing data from participatory agricultural research conducted under highly diverse farmers' field conditions where it is easier to record observations on qualitative than quantitative scale. This technique can also be extended to on-farm participatory testing of other technologies. The findings bear implications for a broad range of participatory research and technology evaluation and verification. 3ainflorescences 3awheat 3aplant adaptation 3afield experimentation 3aheading 3aon-farm research 3aphenology 3aTriticum aestivum 3agrain yield 3agenotype 3afarmers' attitudes 3aharvest date 3atemporal variation 3acultivars 3adeveloping countries 3aagronomic traits 3atillers 3agermplasm screening 3aselection criteria 3abreeding lines 3aNepal 0aresource poor farmers 0aplant breeding 0athousand-seed weight1 aSharma, R.C.1 aMudwari, A.1 aOrtiz-Ferrara, G.1 aSharma, S.1 aBasnet, R.K.1 aWitcombe, J.R.1 aVirk, D.S.1 aJoshi, K.D.0 tField crops research.g2009 June 26, v. 112, no. 2-3 p.124-130dElsevierx0378-42907nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fcr.2009.01.0113Available from publisher's Web site  a20090722b20090801c00000000  aINDd2CTe2009/06/26  aNon-US 7aarticle03472naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127072000900145072000900154072000900163100001300172245012900185300001600314500002400330500001500354520188600369650002802255650001902283650001902302650002502321650002202346650001202368650001702380650002002397650001802417650001302435650001502448650002102463650001602484650001902500650001802519650002302537650001002560653002302570653001502593653002602608653002702634773009402661852000902755856008502764930003302849945002502882946001102907655001202918IND4421433120221122005239.0090605e20090626xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442143312DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fcr.2009.03.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF600 0aF841 0aJ2001 aBlum, A.10aEffective use of water (EUW) and not water-use efficiency (WUE) is the target of crop yield improvement under drought stress  ap. 119-123.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aWater-use efficiency (WUE) is often considered an important determinant of yield under stress and even as a component of crop drought resistance. It has been used to imply that rainfed plant production can be increased per unit water used, resulting in “more crop per drop”. This opinionated review argues that selection for high WUE in breeding for water-limited conditions will most likely lead, under most conditions, to reduced yield and reduced drought resistance. As long as the biochemistry of photosynthesis cannot be improved genetically, greater genotypic transpiration efficiency (TE) and WUE are driven mainly by plant traits that reduce transpiration and crop water-use, processes which are crucially important for plant production. Since biomass production is tightly linked to transpiration, breeding for maximized soil moisture capture for transpiration is the most important target for yield improvement under drought stress. Effective use of water (EUW) implies maximal soil moisture capture for transpiration which also involves reduced non-stomatal transpiration and minimal water loss by soil evaporation. Even osmotic adjustment which is a major stress adaptive trait in crop plants is recognized as enhancing soil moisture capture and transpiration. High harvest index (HI) expresses successful plant reproduction and yield in terms of reproductive functions and assimilate partitioning towards reproduction. In most rainfed environments crop water deficit develops during the reproductive growth stage thus reducing HI. EUW by way of improving plant water status helps sustain assimilate partitions and reproductive success. It is concluded that EUW is a major target for yield improvement in water-limited environments. It is not a coincidence that EUW is an inverse acronym of WUE because very often high WUE is achieved at the expense of reduced EUW. 3adry matter partitioning 3aplant breeding 3aphotosynthates 3awater use efficiency 3adrought tolerance 3adrought 3awater stress 3adryland farming 3atranspiration 3agenotype 3asoil water 3aplant adaptation 3aevaporation 3aphotosynthesis 3aharvest index 3aplant reproduction 3acrops 0aliterature reviews 0acrop yield 0aplant-water relations 0aeffective use of water0 tField crops research.g2009 June 26, v. 112, no. 2-3 p.119-123dElsevierx0378-42907nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fcr.2009.03.0093Available from publisher's Web site  a20090722b20090801c00000000  aINDd2CTe2009/06/26  aNon-US 7aarticle03297naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127072000900145072000900154100002800163245012000191300001600311500002400327500001500351520180100366650001802167650001902185650002502204650002202229650001402251650001602265650002802281650002002309650001802329650002602347650002502373650002002398650001802418651001102436653002202447653001502469700002402484700002602508773009402534852000902628856008502637930003302722945002502755946001102780655001202791IND4421434120221121232701.0090605e20090626xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442143412DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fcr.2009.03.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF120 0aF6001 aKoutroubas, Spyridon D.10aPhenotypic variation in physiological determinants of yield in spring sown safflower under Mediterranean conditions  ap. 199-204.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aSafflower (Carthamus tinctorius L.) growth and productivity are influenced by many factors like genotype, environment and agronomic practices. This field study was conducted to investigate the effects of phenotypic variation in physiological traits on development and yield of spring sown safflower under Mediterranean conditions. Twenty-one genotypes of varying origin were grown for two growing seasons without irrigation. Data were recorded on phenological development stages and seed yield, seed oil content, harvest index (HI) and, seed growth rate (SGR), biomass growth rate (BGR) and economic growth rate (EGR) were determined. Seed yield varied greatly among genotypes and ranged from 1333 to 2870kgha⁻¹. There were large variations in SGR and EGR, which were linearly and positively related to seed yield and explained a large amount of the variation in yield, with r ² values between 0.83 and 0.99. The relative contribution of biomass and HI to the variation in seed yield among genotypes appeared to be dependent on the growing season. When the environmental conditions allowed the genetically controlled variation in biomass production to become more apparent, most of the variation (87%) among genotypes in seed yield were due to the differences in biomass and were not resulted by genotypic differences in HI. Genotypes differed in seed oil content that ranged from 26.7% to 35.8%. Oil yield was mainly determined by seed yield in both seasons. Results indicated that spring sown safflower could be considered as an alternative rainfed crop in cool Mediterranean areas where winter kill is a problem. In conclusion, SGR, BGR and EGR were found to be important physiological determinants of seed yield, which could be used as additional selection criteria for yield improvement. 3alipid content 3afilling period 3aCarthamus tinctorius 3aeconomic analysis 3aphenotype 3afield crops 3adry matter accumulation 3adryland farming 3aharvest index 3afield experimentation 3aphenotypic variation 3acrop management 3asafflower oil 3aGreece 0aplant development 0acrop yield1 aPapakosta, Despo K.1 aDoitsinis, Alexandros0 tField crops research.g2009 June 26, v. 112, no. 2-3 p.199-204dElsevierx0378-42907nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fcr.2009.03.0023Available from publisher's Web site  a20090722b20090801c00000000  aINDd2CTe2009/06/26  aNon-US 7aarticle03619naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001500110245008100125300001400206500012500220500002400345500001500369520201800384650001902402650001502421650002502436650002702461650002002488650002602508650002002534650001702554650003002571650001802601650001302619650001302632650002002645650001602665650001502681650001602696650001402712650001402726650002402740650001202764650001102776650001902787650001502806650001302821651001002834653001902844773012002863852000902983856008502992655001203077IND4471671420221121232725.0130830s2013    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447167142DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYamada, M.10aBreeding goals, trait heredity and genetic improvement of persimmon in Japan  ap. 77-88.  aPaper presented at the V International Symposium on Persimmon, held October 20 - 26, 2012, Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-05  aThe goal of persimmon breeding in Japan is to release new cultivars with improved fruit quality characteristics (non-astringency, high eating quality, commercially acceptable fruit size, the absence of cracks, long shelf-life, and good appearance), high and stable fruit yield, and disease and pest resistance. Of particular importance is the pollination-constant non-astringent (PCNA) trait, however, PCNA cultivars are very limited in the available germplasm. The PCNA trait is inherited qualitatively and the Japanese PCNA (J-PCNA) trait is controlled by recessive genes. Because the J-PCNA cultivars are closely related, repeated crossing among them has led to inbreeding depression for fruit weight and productivity. Consequently, the breeding approach has partly shifted to backcrossing (J-PCNA × non-PCNA) × J-PCNA since 1990, but two generations are generally needed to obtain a low percentage of PCNA offspring due to hexaploidy. Two astringent cultivars with high productivity and large fruit weight were released in 2007 from the PCNA × non-PCNA in this strategy. Unlike the J-PCNA trait, the Chinese PCNA (C-PCNA) trait is controlled by dominant genes, and approximately 50% of the offspring from C-PCNA × non-PCNA possessed this trait. However, the fruits of many C-PCNA offspring still have residual astringency. We developed DNA markers to distinguish the J-PCNA and C-PCNA genotypes, and marker-assisted selection is being effectively employed in PCNA × non-PCNA crosses. Other than the non-astringency trait, most economically-important traits are inherited quantitatively. Many of the traits including fruit ripening time, soluble solids concentration, and fruit cracking are controlled mainly by additive gene action. We predicted with high accuracy the distribution of genotypic values of the offspring for some of these traits. Gradual progress over generations has resulted in the release of new J-PCNA cultivars with early ripening, no calyx-end cracking, and/or high eating qualities. 3adominant genes 3ashelf life 3atotal soluble solids 3ainheritance (genetics) 3apest resistance 3ainbreeding depression 3agenetic markers 3abackcrossing 3amarker-assisted selection 3afruit quality 3acracking 3agenotype 3arecessive genes 3afruit yield 3ahexaploidy 3aastringency 3agermplasm 3acultivars 3agenetic improvement 3aprogeny 3afruits 3afruit cracking 3apersimmons 3aripening 3aJapan 0asoluble solids0 tActa horticulturae.g2013 June, , no. 996 p.77-88dInternational Society for Horticultural Sciencex0567-75727nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.actahort.org/books/996/996_8.htm3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle04254naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127072000900145072000900154072000900163100001700172245006800189300001600257500002400273500001500297520265100312650001402963650000902977650002502986650001703011650002303028650002303051650002503074650001703099650002503116650002203141650001203163650002603175650001703201650002503218650002103243650002203264650001603286651002003302653001403322653002603336653002503362700001803387700001403405773009403419852000903513856008503522930003303607945002503640946001103665655001203676IND4421434020221121232649.0090605e20090626xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442143402DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fcr.2009.03.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF600 0aF200 0aP2101 aNguyen, H.T.10aPhysiological responses to various water saving systems in rice  ap. 189-198.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThe conventional system for irrigating rice uses a large amount of water. Recently a few water saving technologies (saturated soil culture, well-watered aerated conditions such as aerobic rice) have been trialled in the field to reduce water use and to improve water use efficiency. However rice appears to be sensitive to small water deficits; yields are often lower in the water saving technologies. Pot experiments were conducted to simulate rice grown in saturated soil conditions with varying depths to the free water and to measure the physiological responses of rice seedlings and mature plants to them compared to the conventional flooded system of growing rice and to rice grown in aerated conditions. A field study compared the performance of one saturated soil system with flooded rice. A total of 10 cultivars were used in the study. In the glasshouse experiments the different water systems reduced water use by 28-16% relative to the continuously flooded treatment (control) and improved water use efficiency by up to 20% and thus appeared to simulate the effects on water use and water use efficiency reported in field trials. Leaf water potential ranged from 97 to 88% of the control and in most treatments (except in the fully aerated treatment) the roots had access to water at depth in the pot. Thus the plants were exposed to minimum water deficits (except is some aerated rice experiments). However there were significant effects of the water systems on some of the physiological parameters measured. Stomatal conductance was most sensitive with reductions of 27-13% of that of the control. Leaf elongation rate was reduced particularly in the aerated system where water was added to the pots to bring the soil to field capacity every day. Even when minimum available water was kept above 83% there was a significant reduction in stomatal conductance and in leaf elongation rate. On the other hand the effect of the water treatments on many other physiological parameters was very small particularly when the water table was maintained at around 10cm below the soil surface. Thus while rice appears to be sensitive to small reductions in available water, both in the SSC and aerated systems, water use can be reduced using the SSC system with minimum effects on physiological processes provided free water is maintained around 10cm below the soil surface. Field experiments using saturated soil culture in the rice growing area of southern New South Wales, Australia, tended to confirm the sensitivity of stomatal conductance and leaf elongation rate although there was some early un-planned drought stress in this treatment. 3acultivars 3arice 3astomatal conductance 3aplant growth 3aaerobic conditions 3asoil water content 3asaturated conditions 3aOryza sativa 3awater use efficiency 3agenetic variation 3adrought 3afield experimentation 3awater stress 3aleaf water potential 3airrigation rates 3airrigated farming 3awater table 3aNew South Wales 0awater use 0airrigation management 0awater saving systems1 aFischer, K.S.1 aFukai, S.0 tField crops research.g2009 June 26, v. 112, no. 2-3 p.189-198dElsevierx0378-42907nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fcr.2009.03.0043Available from publisher's Web site  a20090722b20090801c00000000  aINDd2CTe2009/06/26  aNon-US 7aarticle02945naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001800110245010400128300001600232500012500248500002400373500001500397520135800412650001301770650001801783650001901801650001101820650004001831650002201871650004101893650002201934650001501956650002801971650001101999650001902010650002202029650004702051650001602098650001602114650000902130653001002139700001602149700001302165700001202178700001502190700001702205773012202222852000902344856008602353655001202439IND4471671920221121232620.0130830s2013    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447167192DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNakatsuka, A.10aAnalysis of expressed sequence tags from rapidly softened pulp of persimmon (Diospyros kaki Thunb.)  ap. 111-116.  aPaper presented at the V International Symposium on Persimmon, held October 20 - 26, 2012, Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-05  aTo improve our understanding of the molecular mechanism of rapid softening of persimmon (Diospyros kaki) ‘Saijo’ fruit on the tree prior to harvest, we constructed a cDNA library from softened pulp of immature fruit and analyzed expressed sequence tags (ESTs). Fruits that were rapidly softened on the tree were harvested at three softening index (from moderately soft to over-ripe) in early October. We sequenced 5728 randomly selected clones from the library, and obtained a total of 4701 ESTs (FY982194-FY986894). Following a sequence homology search, sequences for two 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate (ACC) synthase (Dk-ACS2 and Dk-ACS3) and two ACC oxidase (Dk-ACO1 and Dk-ACO2) cDNAs were isolated, as well as genes for pectinase, hemicellulase and cellulose-interacting protein. Notably, the β-D-galactosidase, xyloglucan endotransglycosylase (XTH), and expansin genes isolated from fruit rapidly softened on the tree showed sequence differences compared with those isolated previously from the ovary and young expanding fruit. One of the isolated genes, Dk-XTH1, was ethylene-dependent. These results suggest that rapid softening of persimmon fruit on the tree is related to ethylene synthesis and hemicellulose degradation. This study provides an initial overview of a set of genes that are expressed during softening of persimmon fruit. 3aethylene 3ahemicellulose 3aDiospyros kaki 3afruits 3axyloglucan:xyloglucosyl transferase 3acomplementary DNA 3aaminocyclopropanecarboxylate oxidase 3apolygalacturonase 3apersimmons 3aexpressed sequence tags 3aclones 3acDNA libraries 3asequence homology 3a1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate synthase 3aplant ovary 3afruit trees 3apulp 0agenes1 aItamura, H.1 aYano, K.1 aAbe, R.1 aSomeya, T.1 aNakagawa, T.0 tActa horticulturae.g2013 June, , no. 996 p.111-116dInternational Society for Horticultural Sciencex0567-75727nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.actahort.org/books/996/996_12.htm3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02449naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001500110245005300125300001600178500012700194500002400321520137700345650001101722650001301733650001401746650001001760650001301770650001001783650001601793651001201809651001901821700002001840700002201860773012201882852000902004856008602013655001202099IND4471682420221121164809.0130903s2013    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447168242DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDe Wit, I.10aBetter3fruit: commercial releases after 10 years  ap. 107-110.  aPaper presented at the XIII Eucarpia Symposium on Fruit Breeding and Genetics, held September 11-15, 2011, Warsaw, Poland.  aIncludes references  aBetter3fruit, a private company based in Belgium, runs one of the biggest apple and pear breeding programs in the world. Each year we create 10,000 selections of apple and of pear. At the time of its foundation in 2000, Better3fruit took over the apple breeding program of the Catholic University of Leuven. In 2005, Better3fruit started a pear breeding program in the Czech Republic. During its short existence Better3fruit has already released a significant number of apple cultivars successfully. The first apple cultivars were released in 2002: 'Nicoter'/Kanzi® and 'Nicogreen'/Greenstar®. With approximately five million trees planted in 2011, 'Nicoter'/Kanzi® is currently considered as one of the most successful club cultivars of the past ten years. Since then Better3fruit has also commercialized 'Zarii', 'Zonga', 'B3F44' and 'B3F45'. Other apple and pear selections are in a pre-commercial testing phase with external commercial partners all around the world. Better3fruit's work does not stop with the breeding. We strongly believe in a guided market introduction in order to ensure that the fruit finds its way to the consumer. For each cultivar, a different commercial strategy is developed, tailored to the cultivar. Better3fruit cultivars are well-positioned in the market in order to generate ongoing added value for all the players in the fruit chain! 3aapples 3abreeding 3acultivars 3apears 3aplanting 3atrees 3avalue added 3aBelgium 3aCzech Republic1 aAuwerkerken, A.1 aPutte, A. van den0 tActa horticulturae.g2013 Feb., , no. 976 p.107-110dInternational Society for Horticultural Sciencex0567-75727nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.actahort.org/books/976/976_11.htm3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02821naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002500150245010700175300001800282520153900300650002201839650002801861650001801889650001401907650001201921650001401933650001701947650001001964650001401974650001301988650001302001650001702014650001302031650001802044650001002062651001102072700002502083700002502108700002102133773017302154856005102327852000902378655001202387IND60411446920221121164803.0150928s2015    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6041144692DNAL7 a10.4315/0362-028X.JFP-14-5792doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAl-Sheyab, Nihaya A.10aToxoplasmosis-Related Knowledge and Preventive Practices among Undergraduate Female Students in Jordan  ap. 1161-1166.  aFoodborne toxoplasmosis is a leading cause of foodborne deaths and hospitalization worldwide. The level of exposure to Toxoplasma gondii is influenced by culture and eating habits. There is a scarcity of data about women's knowledge and perception of this disease. The aim of this study was to determine toxoplasmosis knowledge and preventive practices of young childbearing age women in Jordan. A descriptive cross-sectional study recruited a random sample of 1,390 undergraduate university female students and was stratified based on place of residency. About half of students (51.1%) reported having "ever" heard or read about toxoplasmosis, and almost all students (98.6%) had never been tested for toxoplasmosis. Overall, there was a lack of awareness about toxoplasmosis, its risk factors, symptoms, and timing of infection, and preventive practices. High percentages of females reported a high level of hygienic practices related to hand washing after gardening, changing cat litter, and handling raw meat. However, 16.7% of students reported eating raw meat, 26.5% usually eat traditional herbs, and 17.2% drink untreated spring water. This study establishes a baseline for the awareness levels about toxoplasmosis among young women in Jordan. These findings highlight the urgent need for toxoplasmosis awareness and preventive education for childbearing females. An effective education and outreach program should cover important topics concerning risk factors, high-risk foods, and preventive measures against toxoplasmosis. 3aToxoplasma gondii 3across-sectional studies 3aeating habits 3aeducation 3afemales 3agardening 3ahand washing 3aherbs 3aingestion 3aoutreach 3araw meat 3arisk factors 3astudents 3atoxoplasmosis 3awomen 3aJordan1 aObaidat, Mohammad M.1 aSalman, Alaa E.

Using mapped fire perimeters and satellite-based estimates of post-fire effects (referred to hereafter as fire severity) for 19 fires burning relatively freely over a 31-year period, we demonstrate that fire as a landscape process can exhibit self-limiting characteristics in an upper elevation Sierra Nevada mixed conifer forest. We use the term 'self-limiting' to refer to recurring fire as a process over time (that is, fire regime) consuming fuel and ultimately constraining the spatial extent and lessening fire-induced effects of subsequent fires. When the amount of time between successive adjacent fires is under 9 years, and when fire weather is not extreme (burning index <34.9), the probability of the latter fire burning into the previous fire area is extremely low. Analysis of fire severity data by 10-year periods revealed a fair degree of stability in the proportion of area burned among fire severity classes (unchanged, low, moderate, high). This is in contrast to a recent study demonstrating increasing high-severity burning throughout the Sierra Nevada from 1984 to 2006, which suggests freely burning fires over time in upper elevation Sierra Nevada mixed conifer forests can regulate fire-induced effects across the landscape. This information can help managers better anticipate short- and long-term effects of allowing naturally ignited fires to burn, and ultimately, improve their ability to implement Wildland Fire Use programs in similar forest types. 3aburning 3aconiferous forests 3afire regime 3afire severity 3afire weather 3along term effects 3awildfires 3awildland fire use 3aNevada1 aMiller, Jay D.1 aThode, Andrea E.1 aKelly, Maggi1 avan Wagtendonk, Jan W.1 aStephens, Scott L.0 tEcosystems.g2009 Feb., v. 12, no. 1 p.114-128dSpringer-Verlagx1432-98407nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10021-008-9211-7 7aarticle02918naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002200150245007300172300001800245520164600263650002601909650002801935650001401963650002001977650001201997650003102009650002702040650001302067650001402080650003002094650003702124650002302161651001102184700002402195700003502219700003302254773017302287856005102460852000902511655001202520IND60411447420221121124733.0150928s2015    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6041144742DNAL7 a10.4315/0362-028X.JFP-14-5632doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJackson, Emily E.10aReevaluation of a Suspected Cronobacter sakazakii Outbreak in Mexico  ap. 1191-1196.  aIn 2010, two infants became ill at a hospital in Mexico. Subsequently, a range of clinical, environmental, and powdered and rehydrated infant formula isolates were identified by using a combination of phenotyping and PCR probes. The strains were clustered according to pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. The causative agent was reported as Cronobacter sakazakii, with powdered infant formula (PIF) identified as the likely source of the infections. This new study further characterized the isolates from this outbreak by using multilocus sequence typing and whole genome sequencing of selected strains. Though four PIF isolates and one hospital environmental isolate were identified as C. sakazakii sequence type 297 by multilocus sequence typing, they were isolated 6 months prior to the outbreak. Genotypic analyses of patient isolates identified them as Enterobacter hormaechei and Enterobacter spp. The pulsed-field gel electrophoresis profile of the Enterobacter spp. isolates matched those of isolates from previously unopened tins of PIF. E. hormaechei was only isolated from the two infants and not PIF. The reevaluation of this outbreak highlights the need for accurate detection and identification assays, particularly during outbreak investigations in which incorrect identifications may mislead the investigation and attribution of the source. Though the species responsible for the symptoms could not be determined, this outbreak demonstrated the possible transmission of Enterobacter spp. from PIF to infants. These are possibly the first reported cases of Enterobacter spp. infection of infants from bacterial-contaminated PIF. 3aCronobacter sakazakii 3aEnterobacter hormaechei 3ahospitals 3ainfant formulas 3ainfants 3amultilocus sequence typing 3aoutbreak investigation 3apatients 3aphenotype 3apolymerase chain reaction 3apulsed-field gel electrophoresis 3asource attribution 3aMexico1 aFlores, Julio Parra1 aFernández Escartín, Eduardo,1 aForsythe, S.

A thermal study of aqueous monosaccharides at subzero temperatures  ap. 185-191.  aThermal behavior at subzero temperatures has been investigated for aqueous solutions monosaccharides. The heat of fusion of ice measured with differential scanning calorimetry has given linear plots against sugar concentration (wt.%), from which the amount of unfrozen water, Uw, has been determined for each monosaccharide. The results for Uw are analyzed by employing, as a measure of hydration characteristics, known physico-chemical properties of aqueous monosaccharides, such as partial molar compressibilities, etc. It was revealed that the anti-freeze characteristics of carbohydrates depend on their stereochemistry. More water remains unfrozen in the aqueous solutions of carbohydrates having poorer compatibility with the three-dimensional hydrogen-bond network of water. Monosaccharides studied can be subdivided into three groups according to the extent of the anti-freeze effect. These results are rationalized in terms of a modified stereospecific hydration model. 3aaqueous solutions 3adifferential scanning calorimetry 3aheat 3ahydrogen bonding 3aice 3amodels 3amonosaccharides 3aphysicochemical properties 3astereochemistry 3atemperature 3athermal properties 0aantifreeze properties0 tCarbohydrate research.g2000 Jan. 12, v. 323, no. 1/4 p.185-191x0008-62157nnas  aDNAL  a20001002b20001005c00000000  aINDdLP1  aNon-US 7aarticle01080naa a2200289 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001900110245007000129300001600199520030400215650001400519650002000533650002000553650001100573700001400584700001800598700001100616773008500627852000900712930003300721945001300754946001100767655001200778IND2203474720221121124810.0000330e19990815enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220347472DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAndersen, S.M.10a1,5-Anhydro-D-fructose: regioselective acylation with fatty acids  ap. 250-256.  aRegioselective acylation of 1,5-anhydro-D-fructose was performed with dodecanoic acid to give 1,5-anhydro-6-O-dodecanoyl-D-fructose, chemically in 50% yield and enzymatically in quantitative yield.

However, many of the Salmonella strains currently isolated from dairy farms in the northeastern United States are serovar Cello, a group K strain not detected by this assay. Primers from a well-known PCR assay for the identification of Salmonella were added to a commonly used serotyping assay so that strains, such as Salmonella Cerro, that do not produce bands in the original assay can be confirmed as belonging to S. enterica subsp. enterica. The modified assay frequently misidentified the serogroup of Salmonella Mbandaka isolates because of failure to amplify the wzxC1 amplicon. Therefore, the reverse primer for the wzxC1 target was modified based on in silico analysis to provide consistent classification of Salmonella Mbandaka as belonging to serogroup C1. These two modifications to the serogrouping PCR method enhance the utility of the method for characterizing Salmonella isolates. 3aSalmonella Mbandaka 3adairy farming 3adisease outbreaks 3ahuman diseases 3apolymerase chain reaction 3aserotypes 3aNortheastern United States1 aHaley, Bradd J.1 aVan Kessel, Jo Ann S.0 tJournal of food protection.g2015 June, v. 78, no. 6 p.1182-1185dInternational Association of Milk, Food, and Environmental Sanitarians.wJournal:2024x0362-028X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.4315/0362-028X.JFP-14-475  aDNAL 7aarticle04112naa a2200673 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024003100133040001800164100001900182245011200201300001500313500002400328506007600352520180600428506003702234650002702271650001202298650001502310650002602325650003102351650001002382650001202392650002202404650001702426650002502443650002402468650001102492650002002503650003402523650002402557650001802581650002702599650003902626650004802665650002802713650005602741650003802797650004702835650003002882650003902912650002602951650005202977650001303029650002403042650003403066650002703100700002103127700002103148700002303169773011103192852000903303856008103312856003303393655001203426IND4391701020221207133736.0070523e200705  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439170102DNAL7 a173510522pmid7 aPMC19137942pmcid7 a10.1104/pp.107.0961312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSalmi, Mari L.10aNitric Oxide and cGMP Signaling in Calcium-Dependent Development of Cell Polarity in Ceratopteris richardii  ap. 94-104.  aIncludes references  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aSingle-celled spores of the fern Ceratopteris richardii undergo gravity-directed cell polarity development that is driven by polar calcium currents. Here we present results that establish a role for nitric oxide (NO)/cGMP signaling in transducing the stimulus of gravity to directed polarization of the spores. Application of specific NO donors and scavengers inhibited the calcium-dependent gravity response in a dose-dependent manner. The effects of NO donor exposure were antagonized by application of NO scavenger compounds. Similarly, the guanylate cyclase inhibitors 6-anilino-5,8-quinolinedione and 1H-[1,2,4]oxadiazolo[4,3-a]quinoxalin, and the phosphodiesterase inhibitor Viagra, which modulate NO-dependent cGMP levels in the cells, disrupted gravity-directed cell polarity in a dose-dependent manner. Viagra effects were antagonized by application of NO scavengers, consistent with the postulate that NO and cGMP are linked in the signaling pathway. To identify other components of the signaling system we analyzed gene expression changes induced by Viagra treatment using microarrays and quantitative real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. Preliminary microarray analysis revealed several genes whose expression was significantly altered by Viagra treatment. Three of these genes had strong sequence similarity to key signal transduction or stress response genes and quantitative real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction was used to more rigorously quantify the effects of Viagra on their expression in spores and to test how closely these effects could be mimicked by treatment with dibutyryl cGMP. Taken together our results implicate NO and cGMP as downstream effectors that help link the gravity stimulus to polarized growth in C. richardii spores.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aCeratopteris richardii 3acalcium 3acyclic GMP 3aferns and fern allies 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3agravity 3aguanylate cyclase 3anitric oxide 3anucleotide sequences 3asignal transduction 3aspores 3astress response 2aAminoquinolinesxpharmacology 2aCalciumxmetabolism 2aCell Polarity 2aCyclic GMPxmetabolism 2aDibutyryl Cyclic GMPxpharmacology 2aGuanylate Cyclasexantagonists & inhibitors 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aNitric Oxidexantagonists & inhibitorsxmetabolism. 2aNitric Oxide Donorsxpharmacology 2aPhosphodiesterase Inhibitorsxpharmacology 2aPiperazinesxpharmacology 2aPteridaceaexcytologyxmetabolism. 2aPurinesxpharmacology 2aReverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction 2aRotation 2aSignal Transduction 2aSporesxcytologyxmetabolism. 2aSulfonesxpharmacology1 aMorris, Kacey E.1 aRoux, Stanley J.1 aPorterfield, D.

   1 aBauermeister, L.J.10aValidating the Efficacy of Peracetic Acid Mixture as an Antimicrobial in Poultry Chillers  ap. 1119-1122.  aPeracetic acid mixture (PAHP), which is a combination of peracetic acid and hydrogen peroxide, has been approved as an antimicrobial for use in poultry chillers. To validate its effectiveness, 85 ppm of PAHP was compared with the 30-ppm chlorine treatment in a commercial setting. In this trial, 100 carcasses were sampled for Salmonella and Campylobacter spp. prior to chilling and 100 carcasses were sampled after chilling. In all, 400 carcasses were sampled using 85 ppm of PAHP in the chiller and 400 carcasses were sampled using the chlorine treatment. PAHP at 85 ppm reduced Salmonella-positive carcasses by 92% exiting the chiller, whereas treatment with 30 ppm of chlorine reduced Salmonella by 57%. Additionally, PAHP reduced Campylobacter species-positive carcasses exiting the chiller by 43% while chlorine resulted in a 13% reduction. These results suggest that peracetic acid in combination with hydrogen peroxide may be an effective antimicrobial in poultry chiller applications. 3apoultry production 3ameat processing 3aegg industry 3aeggs 3achicken carcasses 3achicken meat 3afood processing equipment 3acoolers 3asanitizing 3adecontamination 3aperacetic acid 3aacid treatment 3ahydrogen peroxide 3ahypochlorites 3apH 3aSalmonella 3aCampylobacter 3afood pathogens 3abacterial contamination 3abacterial spores 3aoxidation 3amolds (fungi) 3ayeasts 3acooling 3aantibacterial properties 3aantifungal properties1 aBowers, J.W.J.1 aTownsend, J.C.1 aMcKee, S.R.0 tJournal of food protection.g2008 June, v. 71, no. 6 p.1119-1122x0362-028X7nnas  aDNAL  aOther US 7aarticle03147naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001900152245012900171300001600300500002400316520201900340650001902359650002102378650001902399650002002418650002602438650001402464650001002478650001302488650001102501650001002512650002302522650002202545651001802567700001902585773009302604852000902697856005502706655001202761IND4397733220221121095927.0071111e200710  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439773322DNAL7 a10.1111/j.2007.0906-7590.05139.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPoulin, Robert10aSpatial variation in population density across the geographical range in helminth parasites of yellow perch Perca flavescens  ap. 629-636.  aIncludes references  aThe abundance of a species is not constant across its geographical range; it has often been assumed to decrease from the centre of a species' range toward its margins. The central assumption of this "favourable centre" model is tested for the first time with parasites, using different species of helminth parasites exploiting fish as definitive hosts. Data on prevalence (percentage of hosts that are infected) and abundance (mean no. parasites per host) were compiled for 8 helminth species occurring in 23 populations of yellow perch Perca flavescens, from continental North America. For each parasite species, correlations were computed between latitude and both local prevalence and abundance values. In addition, the relationships between the relative prevalence or abundance in one locality and the distance between that locality and the one where the maximum value was reported, were assessed separately for each species to determine whether abundance tends to decrease away from the presumed centre of the range, where it peaks. For both the cestode Proteocephalus pearsei and the acanthocephalan Leptorhynchoides thecatus, there was a positive relationship between prevalence or abundance and the latitude of the sampled population. There was also a significant negative relationship between relative prevalence and the distance from the locality showing the maximum value in P. pearsei, but no such pattern was observed for the other 7 parasite species. Since this single significant decrease in prevalence with increasing distance from the peak value may be confounded by a latitudinal gradient, it appears that the distribution of abundance in parasites of perch does not follow the favourable centre model. This means that the environmental variables affecting the density of parasites (host availability, abiotic conditions) do not show pronounced spatial autocorrelation, with nearby sites not necessarily providing more similar conditions for the growth of parasite populations than distant sites. 3aAcanthocephala 3aPerca flavescens 3aProteocephalus 3aautocorrelation 3aenvironmental factors 3ahelminths 3ahosts 3alatitude 3amodels 3aperch 3apopulation density 3apopulation growth 3aNorth America1 aDick, Terry A.0 tEcography.g2007 Oct., v. 30, no. 5 p.629-636dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0906-75907nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.2007.0906-7590.05139.x 7aarticle03203naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245019800167300001800365520167700383650001902060650001802079650002502097650001202122650001402134650001202148650002002160650001002180650002302190650001802213650001602231650001602247650002302263650002802286650001102314650001502325650002502340651001002365651001102375700001702386700001802403700001702421700002002438700001802458773017302476856005102649852000902700655001202709IND60411445820221121071447.0150928s2015    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6041144582DNAL7 a10.4315/0362-028X.JFP-14-3642doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNanyunja, J.10aAssessing the Status of Food Safety Management Systems for Fresh Produce Production in East Africa: Evidence from Certified Green Bean Farms in Kenya and Noncertified Hot Pepper Farms in Uganda  ap. 1081-1089.  aThe farms of fresh produce farmers are major sources of food contamination by microbiological organisms and chemical pesticides. In view of their choice for farming practices, producers are influenced by food safety requirements. This study analyzes the role of food safety standard certification toward the maturity of food safety management systems (FSMS) in the primary production of fresh produce. Kenya and Uganda are two East African countries that export green beans and hot peppers, respectively, to the European Union but have contrasting features in terms of agricultural practices and certification status. In the fresh produce chain, a diagnostic instrument for primary production was used to assess context factors, core control and assurance activities, and system output to measure the performance of FSMS for certified green bean farms in Kenya and noncertified hot pepper farms in Uganda. Overall, our findings show that in Uganda, noncertified hot pepper farms revealed only a "basic level of control and assurance" activities in their FSMS, which was not satisfactory, because no insight into potential pesticide microbial contamination was presented by these farmers. On the other hand, certified green bean farms in Kenya had an "average level of control and assurance," providing insight into the delivered food safety and quality by the farmers. Farm size did not impact the maturity level of FSMS. This study confirms the role played by food safety standard certification toward the maturity of FSMS implemented in developing countries and demonstrates the possibility of Ugandan farms to upgrade agricultural practices in the fresh produce sector. 3aEuropean Union 3acertification 3adeveloping countries 3aexports 3afarm size 3afarmers 3afarming systems 3afarms 3afood contamination 3afresh produce 3agreen beans 3ahot peppers 3amanagement systems 3amicrobial contamination 3apepper 3apesticides 3aprimary productivity 3aKenya 3aUganda1 aJacxsens, L.1 aKirezieva, K.1 aKaaya, A.

The 518-bp stdA specific sequence was conserved among 268 strains from 45 serovars of S. enterica. One Salmonella bongori CCUG 30042 strain and 34 non-Salmonella strains did not possess this sequence. A sensitivity test revealed that the stdA-specific primer set detected 3.4 x 10(-1) pg of genomic DNA and 3.0 x 10(5) CFU/ml with serial dilutions of Salmonella Typhimurium cells. In vitro testing for specificity using pig carcass sponge samples contaminated with Salmonella Typhimurium also was performed. An initial Salmonella Typhimurium inoculum of 4.4 x 10(1) CFU/ml in pig carcass exudates reached the stdA primer detection level after preenrichment in buffered peptone water at 37°C for 18 h in the presence of indigenous non-Salmonella flora at 4.0 x 10(7) CFU/ml, but the detection level decreased to 4.4 x 10(0) CFU/ml after selective enrichment in Rappaport-Vassiliadis R10 broth for 18 h at 42°C. The PCR method with primers specific for stdA is a quick and sensitive tool for detecting S. enterica, which is an important cause of foodborne disease. 3abacterial contamination 3aserotypes 3apolymerase chain reaction 3aSalmonella Typhimurium 3apig carcasses 3afood pathogens 3amicrobial detection 3aon-farm food safety 2aAnimals 2aColony Count, Microbialxmethods 2aDNA Primers 2aDNA, Bacterialxanalysis 2aFimbriae, Bacterialxgenetics 2aFood Contaminationxanalysisxprevention & control. 2aFood Microbiology 2aGene Amplification 2aHumans 2aPhylogeny 2aPolymerase Chain Reactionxmethodsxstandards. 2aReproducibility of Results 2aSalmonella entericaxclassificationxgeneticsxisolation & purification. 2aSalmonella typhimuriumxclassificationxgeneticsxisolation & purification. 2aSensitivity and Specificity 2aSpecies Specificity 2aSwinexmicrobiology 0aSalmonella 0aSalmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Typhimurium 0aSalmonella enterica1 aYang, C.H.1 aLin, J.H.1 aWang, K.C.1 aCheng, C.P.1 aYeh, K.S.0 tJournal of food protection.g2008 June, v. 71, no. 6 p.1108-1113x0362-028X7nnas  aDNAL  a20080723b20080801c00000000  aINDdPNNe2008/07/22  aOther US 7aarticle01363naa a2200301 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002500110245007900135300001600214520054200230650001300772650001200785650001200797650001900809653002300828700001500851700001500866700001700881773008500898852000900983930003300992945001301025946001101038655001201049IND2203474020221121071530.0000330e19990815enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220347402DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDumont-Hornebeck, B.10aSynthesis of di- and trisaccharides incorporating a crown ether macrocycle  ap. 147-160.  aDi- and trisaccharides incorporating a non-reducing hexopyranose residue linked to a sugar bearing a 18-crown-6-ether were synthesized by the trichloroacetimidate method.

They are the first representatives of a new class of water-soluble cation vectors. 3aalcohols 3acations 3alectins 3atrisaccharides 0alectin recognition1 aJoly, J.P.1 aCoulon, J.1 aChapleur, Y.0 tCarbohydrate research.g1999 Aug. 15, v. 320, no. 3/4 p.147-160x0008-62157nnas  aDNAL  a20000702b20000711c00000000  aINDdLP1  aNon-US 7aarticle03430naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001400150245010300164300001800267520204400285650002102329650002202350650002002372650001602392650002702408650001202435650003002447650002102477650002202498650002302520650002602543650002602569650000902595650001502604650001602619650001302635650001202648650001102660700001902671700002402690700002502714773017302739856005102912852000902963655001202972IND60411445720221121071443.0150928s2015    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6041144572DNAL7 a10.4315/0362-028X.JFP-14-5482doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXu, Aixia10aComparing the Microbiological Status of Pre- and Postharvest Produce from Small Organic Production  ap. 1072-1080.  aConsumption of locally, organically grown produce is increasing in popularity. Organic farms typically produce on a small scale, have limited resources, and adopt low technology harvest and postharvest handling practices. Data on the food safety risk associated with hand harvesting, field packing, and packing-house handling with minimal treatment, at this production scale, are lacking. We followed produce from small organic farms from the field through postharvest handling and packing. Pre- and postharvest produce (177 samples) and water (29 samples) were collected and analyzed quantitatively for Escherichia coli, total coliforms (TC), aerobic bacteria (APC), yeasts, molds (M), and enteric pathogens. No pathogens were recovered. E. coli was detected in 3 (3.6%) of 83 preharvest produce samples, 2 (6.3%) of 32 unwashed and 0 of 42 washed postharvest produce samples, and 10 (34.5%) of 29 water samples. No correlation was found between bacterial levels in irrigation water and those on produce. Postharvest handling without washing was a factor for APC and M counts on tomatoes, with lower frequencies postharvest. Postharvest handling with washing was a factor for leafy greens for TC counts, with higher frequencies postharvest. APC (P = 0.03) and yeast (P = 0.05) counts were higher in preharvest than in unwashed postharvest tomatoes. Washed postharvest leafy greens had higher M counts (P = .0.03) and other washed produce had higher TC counts (P = 0.01) than did their preharvest counterparts. Barriers were found to the use of sanitizer in wash water for leafy greens among small farms using organic practices. Hand harvesting and dry handling did not appear to be associated with a significant food safety risk, but washed leafy greens carried higher levels of some microbial indicators, possibly because of the lack of sanitizer in the wash water. The development of resources and materials customized for this sector of growers could enhance dissemination of information on best practices for handling of leafy greens. 3aEscherichia coli 3acoliform bacteria 3aenteropathogens 3afood safety 3agreen leafy vegetables 3agrowers 3ainformation dissemination 3airrigation water 3amanual harvesting 3aorganic production 3apostharvest treatment 3aquantitative analysis 3arisk 3asanitizers 3asmall farms 3atomatoes 3awashing 3ayeasts1 aPahl, Donna M.1 aBuchanan, Robert L.1 aMicallef, Shirley A.0 tJournal of food protection.g2015 June, v. 78, no. 6 p.1072-1080dInternational Association of Milk, Food, and Environmental Sanitarians.wJournal:2024x0362-028X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.4315/0362-028X.JFP-14-548  aDNAL 7aarticle02918naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004000092024002200132024001900154040001800173072000900191100001900200245008200219300001600301500002400317500001500341506007600356520134300432506003701775650002201812650001801834650001401852650001901866650001601885650002101901650001901922650002501941653001601966653001901982653001502001653002302016653001402039700001602053700002002069700001802089700001902107773009402126852000902220856009002229930003302319945002502352946001102377655001202388IND4421428320221207131216.0090605e20091015xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442142832DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2009.03.0622doi7 aPMC27496892pmcid7 a201610272pmid  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ5051 aSingh, Ajay P.10aIsolation of specific cranberry flavonoids for biological activity assessment  ap. 963-968.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aCharacterisation of cranberry compound biological activity is constrained by limitations in isolation methodology. A single rapid procedure for polyphenolic isolation was developed using semi-preparative-HPLC. Non-flavonoid compounds were removed by pre-purification procedures prior to semi-preparative-HPLC. Fractions were analysed to ascertain purity (99%) with HPLC and ESI mass spectrometric detection in negative ion mode and on-line diode array ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy. Isolated cranberry flavonols included quercetin-3-galactoside, quercetin-3-glucoside, quercetin-3-rhamnoside, myricetin-3-galactoside, myricetin-3-arabinofuranoside, and quercetin-3-O-(6"-p-benzoyl)-β-galactoside. Proanthocyanidin isolates contained monomers, dimers, trimers, and larger polymers. Anthocyanins consisted largely of galactoside and arabinoside conjugates of cyanidin and peonidin. Identities were confirmed using 1D-NMR- and 2D-NMR-spectrometry as well as reference standards. Flavonol fractions exhibited the highest antioxidant activity in a dosedependent manner, while the anthocyanin fraction exhibited the least activity. Biological activity studies of cranberry phenolics will benefit from the improved isolation procedures described in this study and the confirmation of antioxidant activities of various cranberry constituents.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aproanthocyanidins 3afood analysis 3aflavonols 3achromatography 3acranberries 3afood composition 3aanthocyanidins 3aantioxidant activity 0apolyphenols 0aphytochemicals 0aflavonoids 0aanalytical methods 0aisolation1 aWilson, Ted1 aKalk, Amanda J.1 aCheong, James1 aVorsa, Nicholi0 tFood chemistry.g2009 Oct. 15, v. 116, no. 4 p.963-968dElsevier Sciencex0308-81467nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2009.03.0623Available from publisher's Web site  a20090722b20090801c00000000  aINDd7CTe2009/07/03  aNon-US 7aarticle02080naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131100002400149245009400173300001600267500002400283520099800307650001101305650002101316650002601337650003701363650001301400650000901413650001401422650001901436650001301455650002301468651001101491700001901502773009901521852000901620856008901629655001201718IND4477043220221121061304.0140212s2003    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447704322DNAL7 a10.1016/S0921-4488(02)00259-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAl-Majali, Ahmad M.10aPeriod prevalence and etiology of subclinical mastitis in Awassi sheep in southern Jordan  ap. 243-248.  aIncludes references  aTo investigate the period prevalence, etiology and some epidemiological features of subclinical mastitis in Awassi ewes from the southern part of Jordan, milk samples from 318 lactating ewes were aseptically collected for bacterial and somatic cell counts (SCC) tests. Milk samples were collected at monthly intervals. The period prevalence of subclinical mastitis was 18.3% and the prevalence within each flock remained relatively constant throughout the study period. A significant association (P<0.001) was observed between the occurrence of subclinical mastitis and the age of ewe. Presence of teat lesions has no impact on the prevalence of subclinical mastitis. The prevalent bacterial species isolated from mammary glands with subclinical mastitis were Staphylococcus aureus (39%), Streptococci (25%), Escherichia coli (19.6%) and coagulase-negative Staphylococci (17.9%). Coagulase-negative Staphylococci were the most prevailing isolates from samples that showed negative SCC results. 3aAwassi 3aEscherichia coli 3aStaphylococcus aureus 3acoagulase negative staphylococci 3aetiology 3aewes 3alactation 3amammary glands 3amastitis 3asomatic cell count 3aJordan1 aJawabreh, Sami0 tSmall ruminant research.g2003 Mar., v. 47, no. 3 p.243-248dElsevier Sciencex0921-44887nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0921-4488(02)00259-63Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02905naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001500145245008400160300001600244520184100260650001702101650001702118650001602135700002402151700001902175700002302194700002202217700001902239700001902258700002202277773011802299852000902417856008502426930003302511946001102544655001202555IND4441660520221121033904.0100820e201010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444166052DNAL7 a10.2478/s11536-009-0143-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAcar, Ali 10aCoexistence of pancreatic tuberculosis with systemic brucellosis: a case report  ap. 573-576.  aIsolated pancreatic tuberculosis is an extremely rare clinical entity and is difficult to diagnose particularly in immunocompetent individuals. Clinical findings and symptomatology of brucellosis are often similar to tuberculosis thus making the differentiation amongst the two entities difficult. We report a case of pancreatic tuberculosis with systemic brucellosis in a 29 year old veterinarian who presented with epigastric pain and loss of appetite. Initial investigations revealed leukocytosis with moderately elevated transaminase, gamma glutamyl transferase, amylase and lipase levels. Imaging studies revealed an anechoic multiloculated cyst in the body and tail of the pancreas. Given the patient's occupational risk coupled with the presence of a positive Brucella agglutination test (with a titer of 1:320); a diagnosis of pancreatitis secondary to brucellosis was given. In addition to standard pancreatitis therapy of bowel rest with intravenous fluid/electrolyte replacement, anti-brucellosis therapy was also administered. The patient's initial response to therapy was positive however, 6 weeks into therapy, his abdominal pain recurred and repeat CT scan revealed the development of a pseudocyst in the pancreas. After failing a second attempt at conservative supportive therapy, the patient underwent an explorative laparotomy. Histological examination of the resected pancreatic specimen showed necrosis and was positive for tuberculosis by polymerase chain reaction. Herein, we describe the first case reported in the medical literature of the coexistence of systemic brucellosis with pancreatic tuberculosis. We suggest that the possibility of the coexistence of brucellosis with tuberculosis be kept in mind when assessing pancreatitis patients in endemic regions and in individuals with occupational risk hazards. 3apancreatitis 3atuberculosis 3abrucellosis1 aSücüllü, İlker 1 aBaylan, Orhan 1 aFiliz, Ali İlker 1 aDiktaş, Hüsrev 1 aKıvanc, Mert 1 aÖncül, Oral 1 aGörenek, Levent 0 tCentral European journal of medicine.g2010 Oct., v. 5, no. 5 p.573-576dHeidelberg : SP Versitax1895-10587nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2478/s11536-009-0143-13Available from publisher's Web site  a20100821b20100903c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03681naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134072000900152072000900161100001700170245014600187300001400333500002400347520213100371650002102502650002302523650001902546650001802565650002302583650002102606650001002627650002202637650002002659650001102679650002202690650002302712650001702735650002402752650000902776650000802785653001202793700001602805700001402821700001802835700001402853773011402867852000902981856009202990930003303082945002503115946001103140655001203151IND4421429420221121024223.0090605e20090610xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442142942DNAL7 a10.1016/j.anifeedsci.2009.03.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL500 0aL6001 aKanyinji, F.10aEffects of supplementary inosine on nutrient digestibility, ruminal fermentation and nitrogen balance in goats fed high amount of concentrate  ap. 12-20.  aIncludes references  aA study was conducted to compare responses of nutrient intake, digestibility, ruminal fermentation, and N balance in goats fed high amounts of concentrate supplemented with inosine or urea. Four Japanese Saneen goats (49.2±5kg), housed in individual metabolic cages, were blocked by weight into two pairs, and assigned inosine or urea as non-protein N (NPN) supplements to their basal diet at 0.15g per kg body weight on a urea basis, in a 2x2 switch back experimental design. The basal diet consisted of 0.4 timothy hay, and 0.6 concentrates, and was fed to the goats as a total mixed ration (TMR). The experimental period was 13 days, including 7 days of adaptation, 5 days of sampling of feces, urine and orts, and 1 day of sampling of rumen fluid. Intake of dry matter (DM), organic matter (OM), neutral detergent fiber (NDF) and crude protein (CP) and digestibility in the total tract, as well as N balance, were assessed by total fecal collection. Rumen fluid was sampled at 0, 1, 4 and 7h after feeding, and analyzed for pH, ammonia and volatile fatty acids (VFA). Additionally, samples collected at 0 and 4h after feeding were assessed for protozoal counts. Daily intakes of DM, OM, NDF and CP did not differ among treatments. Digestibility in the total tract tended (P=0.07) to be lower for NDF and was numerically lower for DM (P=0.11), OM (P=0.11), and NDF (P=0.12) in goats supplemented with inosine versus urea. Ammonia concentration and ruminal pH were similar among treatments, and protozoal counts 4h after feeding was lower (P=0.02) in goats supplemented with inosine compared to those on urea. No differences between treatments occurred in concentrations of rumen VFA (i.e., acetate, propionate, valerate, iso-acids, and total VFA) except for butyrate, which was higher (P=0.03) in goats supplemented with inosine versus urea 4h after feeding. There were no differences in intake, absorption and retention of N between treatments. Thus, responses in nutrient intake, digestibility, ruminal fermentation and N balance in goats fed high amounts of concentrate with supplementary inosine and urea were similar. 3afeed supplements 3aruminant nutrition 3aanimal feeding 3adigestibility 3arumen fermentation 3anitrogen balance 3agoats 3afeed concentrates 3anutrient intake 3aSaanen 3ametabolic studies 3aexperimental diets 3arumen fluids 3anonprotein nitrogen 3aurea 3ahay 0ainosine1 aKumagai, H.1 aMaeda, T.1 aKaneshima, S.1 aYokoi, D.0 tAnimal feed science and technology.g2009 June 10, v. 152, no. 1-2 p.12-20dElsevier Sciencex0377-84017nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.anifeedsci.2009.03.0043Available from publisher's Web site  a20090722b20090801c00000000  aINDd3CTe2009/06/28  aNon-US 7aarticle03855naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134072000900152072000900161072000900170100001900179245011300198300001400311500002400325500001500349520255500364650001702919650002302936650002202959650002502981650002203006650001603028650002003044650001803064653002503082700001303107700001703120773011403137852000903251856009203260930003303352945002503385946001103410655001203421IND4421430220221121024020.0090605e20090610xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442143022DNAL7 a10.1016/j.anifeedsci.2009.03.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF600 0aR100 0aR3001 aHargreaves, A.10aEffect of stage of growth on the chemical composition, nutritive value and ensilability of whole-crop barley  ap. 50-61.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aChemical composition, nutritive value and ensilability of whole-crop barley as a supplementary feed for dairy cows was investigated using a range of maturities of barley (seed coat ripe--GS 69, early dough stage--GS 82, soft dough--GS 87 and grain ripe--GS 90) in small scale silos. The ensiling experiment was based on a complete randomised design with three replicate silos per harvest date. Twelve 0.225m³ plastic silo (were used in the experiment and silo were sampled on opening for chemical composition and nutritive value. The fermentation process reduced the concentrations of water-soluble carbohydrate in the ensiled forage compared to the fresh forage. The proportion of residual WSC in silage did however increase with increasing crop maturity (0.051, 0.077, 0.167 and 0.560 of WSC retained in the silage after the process of fermentation from forages cut at GS 69, 82, 87 and 90 respectively). Silages that were made from forage cut at the most mature stage of growth had a substantially lower production (P<0.001) of total fermentation acids (38.9g/kgDM for GS 90) compared to those made from the least mature forage (203.4g/kgDM for GS 69). The pH and concentrations of the various fermentation acids for silages made with the least mature forage (GS 69) were typical of acetic acid dominated fermentation. These silages contained little or no butyric acid and had a pH of 4.5 and contained high concentrations of ammonia-N (186g/kg total N). Silages produced from forages cut at growth stage 82 were similar to those conserved from immature forages, having acetic acid dominated fermentation (lactic acid to acetic acid ratio of 1:1.22), relatively high pH (4.85) and high concentrations of ammonia-N (141g/kg total N). These silages differed from those made from the most immature forage insofar that they contained high concentrations of butyric acid (50.5g/kgDM). The processes of fermentation were affected by the stage of growth of the forage at ensiling and hence the economics of silage production. If the forage was too immature at ensiling, the yield of crop would be compromised but the silage produced may have moderate to high nutritive value and reasonable aerobic stability during the feed out phase. If the whole-crop forage was grown as a crop to secure high levels of supplementary feed from an alternative forage source (other than grass), the trade-off between yield, nutritive value and losses of feed immediately after silo opening would suggest the crop should be harvested between 350 and 450gDM/kg dry matter. 3aplant growth 3adry matter content 3awhole crop silage 3adevelopmental stages 3achemical analysis 3afeed barley 3anutritive value 3asilage making 0achemical composition1 aHill, J.1 aLeaver, J.D.0 tAnimal feed science and technology.g2009 June 10, v. 152, no. 1-2 p.50-61dElsevier Sciencex0377-84017nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.anifeedsci.2009.03.0073Available from publisher's Web site  a20090722b20090801c00000000  aINDd3CTe2009/06/28  aNon-US 7aarticle03394naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245006600127300001400193500017300207500002400380500001500404520179300419650001402212650001002226650001102236650001602247650003002263650001102293650001102304650002202315650001802337650001402355650001302369650002002382650002002402650001302422650002202435650001602457650001202473650001002485650001102495650001102506650001302517650001202530650001002542650001602552653002502568700001602593700001702609773012002626852000902746856008502755655001202840IND4471602520221120222148.0130830s2013    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447160252DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSeehuber, C.10aConcepts of selective mechanical thinning in fruit tree crops  ap. 77-83.  aPaper presented at the EUFRIN Thinning Working Group Symposia, held March 11, 2010 - March 9th, 2012, Catalonia, Spain, Wageningen, Netherlands and Ljubljana, Slovenia.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-05  aThis contribution presents an innovative approach for thinning fruit crops trained to any kind of spindle trees, irrespective of species, cultivar, temperature and tree age. Mechanical thinning is suggested as an alternative or to compliment chemical thinning. Four concepts of its implementation are presented here: a) sole use of mechanical thinning to overcome alternate bearing, b) combination of mechanical thinning with chemical (and hand-thinning) in IFP, c) combination with lime sulphur where approved for organic fruit farming, and d) combination of mechanical thinning with hand-thinning where no chemicals are approved. The device with three horizontal rotors and front mounting of the tractor has been developed at the University of Bonn in 2005-2007. By selecting a range of combinations of brushes, rotor speeds 350-450 rpm) and tractor speeds (4-8 km/h), its vertically operating brushes remove ca. 25-33% of flowers. Due to its use at early developmental stages, i.e., during flowering (between pink bud and petal fall), mechanical thinning on its own can break or prevent alternate/biennial bearing. Mechanical thinning alone or in combination with either chemical or hand-thinning improved fruit quality, particularly fruit size (by improving the source sink relationship and enlarging the photo-assimilates partitioned to the remaining fruit) and colouration (by allowing more light access to the fruit and removal of shade fruits from the inner canopy), sugar (taste), and sometimes firmness for better storability. The device saves labour costs, otherwise required for hand-thinning, in the order of 15-30 hours per hectare, equivalent to € 100-150/ha, i.e., in the same order as the mechanical thinning of ca. 120 €/ha, based on 20 ha and 10 years depreciation. 3aflowering 3alabor 3arotors 3afruit trees 3asource-sink relationships 3asulfur 3asugars 3aearly development 3afruit quality 3acultivars 3atractors 3afarming systems 3astorage quality 3afirmness 3aalternate bearing 3atemperature 3abrushes 3ataste 3acanopy 3afruits 3atree age 3aflowers 3acolor 3afruit crops 0adevelopmental stages1 aDamerow, L.1 aBlanke, M.M.0 tActa horticulturae.g2013 July, , no. 998 p.77-83dInternational Society for Horticultural Sciencex0567-75727nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.actahort.org/books/998/998_8.htm3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02198naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002900092040001800121100002100139245014400160300001600304520096600320650002101286650002001307650002001327650001601347650001601363650002701379650001201406650001601418650001401434650002601448650002001474650001801494650001001512700001901522773010001541852000901641856007901650930003301729945001301762946001301775655001201788IND2061309520221120222305.0980115e199504  dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND206130952DNAL7 a10.1021/jf00052a0182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aArentoft, A.M.K.10aAnalysis of 3-(N-oxalyl)-L-2-3-diaminopropanoic acid and its alpha-isomer in grass pea (Lathyrus sativus) by capillary zone electrophoresis  ap. 942-945.  aA method was developed for the simultaneous-quantitative determination of the neurotoxic nonprotein amino acid 3-(N-oxalyl)-L-2,3-diaminopropanoic acid (beta-ODAP) and its nontoxic alpha-isomer 2-(N-oxalyl)-L-2,3-diaminopropanoic acid (alpha-ODAP) in seeds of grass pea (Lathyrus sativus) by capillary zone electrophoresis (CZE). Samples of 0.5 g of seed flour were extracted in 2 volumes of 10 mL of ethanol-water (6:4) by tumbling for 45 min each time. Hippuric acid was used as an internal standard. The separation was performed in a 50 micrometer i.d. uncoated capillary at 515 V/cm and 40 degrees C in 20 mM Na2HPO4 buffer at pH 7.8 with direct UV detection at 195 nm. A linear response was recorded in the concentration range 0.015-1.8 mM. This corresponds to a detection limit of 0.1 g kg-1. Comparison between the CZE method and a standard colorimetric method for measuring total ODAP in 38 lines of grass pea gave a coefficient of correlation of 0.994. 3aLathyrus sativus 3aLathyrus cicera 3aLathyrus ochrus 3afeed grains 3afood grains 3anonprotein amino acids 3aisomers 3aneurotoxins 3adetection 3aquantitative analysis 3aelectrophoresis 3arapid methods 3aflour1 aGreirson, B.N.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g1995 Apr., v. 43, no. 4 p.942-945x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf00052a0183Available from publisher's Web site  a19980201b19980206c00000000  aINDdGHK  aOther US 7aarticle03893naa a2200769 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111072001700129072001700146072001700163072001700180072001700197072001700214100001500231245014900246300001600395500001500411520150000426650002501926650001701951650002801968650002801996650001902024650001502043650002302058650001702081650002702098650002002125650001202145650002602157650001202183650001202195650004002207650001302247650002802260650002802288650003702316650002202353650001902375650006302394650005602457650002202513650005002535650001102585650002602596650003402622650002302656650005202679650002302731650004102754650002602795650001602821650001702837653002802854653002902882700001502911700002202926773008302948852000903031930003303040945002503073946001303098655001203111IND4422006920221120195840.0090618e200905  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442200692DNAL7 a195177172pmid  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Results from pure culture assays in water with the treatment chemical revealed that 0.5% organic acid and 0.05 to 1% SDS, when used individually, reduced pathogen cell numbers by <or=2 log CFU/ml within 20 min at 21°C. The combination of any of these organic acids at 0.5% with 0.05% SDS resulted in >7 log CFU/ml inactivation of Salmonella and E. coli O157:H7 within 10 s at 21°C. A combination of levulinic acid and SDS was evaluated at different concentrations for pathogen reduction on lettuce at 21°C, on poultry (wings and skin) at 8°C, and in water containing chicken feces or feathers at 21°C. Results revealed that treatment of lettuce with a combination of 3% levulinic acid plus 1% SDS for <20 s reduced both Salmonella and E. coli O157:H7 populations by >6.7 log CFU/g on lettuce. Salmonella and aerobic bacterial populations on chicken wings were reduced by >5 log CFU/g by treatment with 3% levulinic acid plus 2% SDS for 1 min. Treating water heavily contaminated with chicken feces with 3% levulinic acid plus 2% SDS reduced Salmonella populations by >7 log CFU/ml within 20 s. The use of levulinic acid plus SDS as a wash solution may have practical application for killing foodborne enteric pathogens on fresh produce and uncooked poultry. 3achemical composition 3achicken skin 3abacterial contamination 3afood processing quality 3alevulinic acid 3aSalmonella 3afood contamination 3ainactivation 3asodium dodecyl sulfate 3afood processing 3alettuce 3aEscherichia coli O157 3awashing 2aAnimals 2aAnti-Infective Agentsxpharmacology 2aChickens 2aColony Count, Microbial 2aConsumer Product Safety 2aDose-Response Relationship, Drug 2aDrug Combinations 2aDrug Synergism 2aEscherichia coli O157xdrug effectsxgrowth & development. 2aFood Contaminationxanalysisxprevention & control. 2aFood Microbiology 2aFood-Processing Industryxmethodsxstandards. 2aHumans 2aLettucexmicrobiology 2aLevulinic Acidsxpharmacology 2aMeatxmicrobiology 2aSalmonellaxdrug effectsxgrowth & development. 2aSkinxmicrobiology 2aSodium Dodecyl Sulfatexpharmacology 2aSurface-Active Agents 2aTemperature 2aTime Factors 0aorganic acids and salts 0aEscherichia coli O157:H71 aZhao, Ping1 aDoyle, Michael P.0 tJournal of food protection.g2009 May, v. 72, no. 5 p.928-936x0362-028X7nnas  aDNAL  a20090813b20091002c00000000  aINDd3CTe2009/07/12  aOther US 7aarticle02598naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092040001800119100001400137245010900151300001800260520147600278650001301754650001001767650001201777650001301789650002701802650000701829650003601836653001701872653003201889700001501921700001301936700001601949773010201965852000902067856007702076930003302153945001302186946001302199655001202212IND2061312620221120200113.0980115e199608  dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND206131262DNAL7 a10.1021/jf960165k2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNaczk, M.10aProtein precipitating capacity of crude canola tannins: effect of pH, tannin, and protein concentrations  ap. 2144-2148.  aThe protein precipitating capacity of canola tannins was evaluated using the protein precipitation assay of Hagerman and Butler (J. Agric. Food Chem. 1978, 26, 809-812) and the dye-labeled bovine serum albumin (BSA) assay of Asquith and Butler (J. Chem. Ecol. 1985, 11, 1535-1543). Condensed tannins were isolated from hulls of Cyclone, Excel, and Westar canola cultivars. The tannin content in the hulls ranged from 98 to 1973 mg of catechin equivalents/100 g of hulls, as determined by the vanillin assay. The effect of pH on the affinities of dye-labeled and unlabeled BSA, fetuin, gelatin, lysozyme, and pepsin was monitored. The optimum pH for the precipitation of dye-labeled and unlabeled BSA was found to be 3.5 and 4.0, respectively. The optimum pH for the precipitation of proteins was found to be 0.3-3.1 pH units below the isoelectric points of the proteins. The crude tannin extracts contained about 20% proanthocyanidins, which were soluble in ethyl acetate as determined by the vanillin assay. Canola tannins showed definitive thresholds prior to the formation of insoluble tannin-protein complexes as determined by the protein precipitation assay. There was also a linear correlation (r2 = 0.975) between the amount of tannin-protein complex formed and the amount of tannin added to the system. Ethyl acetate soluble proanthocyanidins contributed to the protein-precipitating capacity of crude canola tannins isolated from low-tannin Cyclone canola hulls. 3arapeseed 3ahulls 3atannins 3aproteins 3achemical precipitation 3apH 3achemical constituents of plants 0ainteractions 0atannin-protein interactions1 aOickle, D.1 aPink, D.1 aShahidi, F.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g1996 Aug., v. 44, no. 8 p.2144-2148x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf960165k3Available from publisher's Web site  a19980301b19980309c00000000  aINDdLDP  aOther US 7aarticle01747naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110100002300127245009600150300001600246500001500262520048300277650003000760650002000790650001900810650001300829650002000842650001900862650001800881650002200899651001600921651001100937653001600948653002000964653002600984700002201010700002501032700002301057700002201080700002101102773008801123852000901211930003301220945002501253946001101278655001201289IND4422005920221120190703.0090618s2009    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442200592DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

For the sequence BaF₂, no modifier, W and Rh, the characteristic masses were 16, 17, 58 and 37pg, and the RSD were 1.3%, 0.6%, 9.8% and 10.8%, respectively. BaF₂ and absence of modifier furnished the best thermal stability, signal profile, repeatability and characteristic mass. For slurries containing 0.5% (m/v), 0.2% (v/v) HNO₃, 0.05% (v/v) Triton X-100, the pyrolysis and atomisation temperatures were 1700 and 2600°C, respectively.

The impact of five dormancy regulating chemicals on overcoming salinity-induced germination inhibition was assessed under the best germination conditions in the two species. Seeds were germinated in a series of NaCl concentrations: 0-200 mM NaCl for P. turgidum, and 0-300 mM NaCl for L. scindicus. Lasiurus scindicus seeds were more tolerant to salinity than those of P. turgidum. Twenty percent of P. turgidum seeds germinated in 100 mM NaCl and none in the higher levels, but 47.5% and 8.8% of L. scindicus seeds germinated in 100 and 200 mM NaCl, respectively. The five studied chemicals (fusicoccin, GA₃, kinetin, nitrate and thiourea) did not succeed in improving germination of non-saline treated seeds of the two species, compared to the control, except thiourea in P. turgidum. The salinity-induced germination inhibition in P. turgidum was completely alleviated by the application of gibberellic acid (GA₃), partially alleviated by the application of fusicoccin, kinetin and thiourea, but not affected by nitrate. In L. scindicus, the germination inhibition was completely alleviated by fusicoccin, GA₃, nitrate and thiourea, but partially alleviated by kinetin. For using the two grass species in restoration of degraded rangelands affected by higher salinity, the results suggest using fusicoccin, GA₃, nitrate and thiourea with L. scindicus and GA₃ with P. turgidum seeds as a preseeding treatment can overcome the problem of reduced germination. 3aPanicum turgidum 3adeserts 3adormancy 3aforage grasses 3afusicoccin 3agermination 3agibberellic acid 3akinetin 3anitrates 3arangelands 3asalinity 3aseeds 3asodium chloride 3athiourea 0aDesert grasses 0aGlycophytes 0aSalinity induced dormancy1 aAl-Ansari, Fatima1 aAl-Shamsi, Naeema0 tPlant growth regulation.g2010 Nov., v. 62, no. 2 p.163-170dSpringer Netherlandsx0167-69037nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10725-010-9501-x 7aarticle04830naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134072000900152072000900161072000900170072000900179100001500188245017300203300001400376500002400390520323300414650002203647650001103669650000903680650002203689650002803711650001803739650002303757650002303780650001603803650001103819650002103830650002303851650001403874650002203888653003903910653004203949700001703991700002004008773011404028852000904142856009204151930003304243945002504276946001104301655001204312IND4421430420221120155216.0090605e20090610xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442143042DNAL7 a10.1016/j.anifeedsci.2009.03.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL100 0aL500 0aL600 0aQ5021 aEun, J.-S.10aInfluence of replacing barley grain with corn-based dried distillers grains with solubles on production and carcass characteristics of growing and finishing beef steers  ap. 72-80.  aIncludes references  aA series of in vivo experiments was conducted for the effects of supplementing corn-based dried distillers grains with solubles (DDGS) to a barley ration for growing and finishing beef steers on growth performance, digestibility, ruminal fermentation and carcass characteristics. Forty-five predominantly British-based crossbred steers (initial body weight (BW)=257±16kg) were used in these trials. Steers were housed in groups of 5 in shaded pens, and they received one out of three treatment diets: control without DDGS (C), low inclusion level of DDGS (LD) and high inclusion level of DDGS (HD). The concentrate of the C diet consisted of only dry rolled barley, whereas the LD and the HD diets contained both dry rolled barley and DDGS. While the growing diet contained 105 and 175g DDGS/kg diet dry matter (DM) to the LD and HD diets, the finishing diet comprised 114 and 183g DDGS/kg diet DM to the LD and HD diets, respectively. In a completely randomized design, the growing and the finishing trials lasted for 84 and 112 d, respectively, and BW change, DM intake, average daily gain (ADG), gain to feed ratio (G:F) and carcass characteristics were measured. Right after completion of the performance trials, a digestibility trial was performed to test the C and HD diets used in the growing trial to assess digestibility and ruminal fermentation in a replicated 2x2 Latin square design using four beef cows. Initial and final BW did not differ among treatments in the growing and the finishing trials (P>0.55). However, growing steers fed the HD diet gained the largest BW followed by the LD and the C diets (P=0.05). Intake of DM decreased as more DDGS were included in the growing diets (P<0.01). Thus, ADG (P=0.05) and G:F (P=0.02) were improved by including DDGS in the diets regardless of level of DDGS. Supplementing DDGS to the finishing diets decreased DM intake (P=0.01) and tended (P=0.14) to increase G:F, although there were no differences between the LD and the HD diets. Supplementation of DDGS tended to increase marbling score (P=0.11) and yield grade (P=0.06), but tended to decrease ribeye area (P=0.09). In addition, feeding the HD diet increased backfat thickness compared with the C and the LD diets. While DM and acid detergent fiber digestibilities did not differ (P>0.48), neutral detergent fiber (aNDF) digestibility tended (P=0.14) to increase with feeding the HD diet. Ruminal pH numerically increased with the HD diet, but it failed to have a significant effect (P=0.33). Supplementing DDGS in a barley ration to growing and finishing steers resulted in no adverse effects on performance, digestion, ruminal fermentation and carcass characteristics, although DM intake was reduced at relatively lower inclusion rates of DDGS compared with those typically used in other studies. The LD and HD diets improved ADG and G:F of growing steers, whereas both diets resulted in similar responses on ADG and G:F of finishing steers compared to the C diet. The positive responses of growing steers are likely due to increases in ruminal pH and aNDF digestion. With increasing availability and economic feasibility, DDGS can be effectively supplemented to barley-based beef diets up to 183g/kg diet DM. 3adistillers grains 3abarley 3acorn 3aanimal production 3acarcass characteristics 3adigestibility 3aexperimental diets 3aruminant nutrition 3abeef cattle 3asteers 3afeed supplements 3arumen fermentation 3afinishing 3adry matter intake 0acorn-based dried distillers grains 0adried distillers grains with solubles1 aZoBell, D.R.1 aWiedmeier, R.D.0 tAnimal feed science and technology.g2009 June 10, v. 152, no. 1-2 p.72-80dElsevier Sciencex0377-84017nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.anifeedsci.2009.03.0113Available from publisher's Web site  a20090722b20090801c00000000  aINDd3CTe2009/06/28  aNon-US 7aarticle02804naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003700092040001800129072000900147072000900156072000900165100002300174245009700197300001800294500002400312500001500336520135500351650002101706650002201727650001801749650002201767650002601789650001001815650001601825650002401841650002301865650002301888650001701911650001301928650002401941651001601965653001401981653001701995653002102012773010002033852000902133856008702142930003302229945002502262946001102287655001202298IND4421431620221120155056.0090605e200909  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442143162DNAL7 a10.1016/j.agwat.2009.04.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aP210 0aE200 0aX1001 aAbu-Madi, Maher O.10aFarm-level perspectives regarding irrigation water prices in the Tulkarm district, Palestine  ap. 1344-1350.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aAgriculture consumes about 70% of water available in the Occupied Palestinian Territories. Domestic and industrial users utilize 30% of the water supply. Water resource managers are considering the policy of reallocating a portion of the water supply from agriculture to other uses. It is believed that increasing irrigation water prices could influence water consumption and thus make water available for non-agricultural (more economic) uses. This paper examines the impacts of water pricing on agricultural water consumption and farming profitability and provides some guidelines for policy makers regarding water pricing as a tool to manage scarce water resources. We estimate a regression model describing agricultural water consumption as a function of water prices, irrigated land area, farm income, and irrigation frequency, using data collected in a survey of about 150 farmers in the Tulkarm district. We conclude that irrigation water prices are perceived as high and comprise a large portion of total farming expenses. Therefore, attempts to increase irrigation water prices in the Tulkarm district might jeopardize farming feasibility and might have substantial impacts on agricultural water consumption. Nevertheless, many farmers would continue farming even if the water prices were increased beyond their willingness to pay threshold. 3airrigation water 3asimulation models 3aprofitability 3aagricultural land 3airrigation scheduling 3afarms 3afarm income 3aregression analysis 3awillingness to pay 3afarmers' attitudes 3awater policy 3aland use 3aagricultural policy 3aMiddle East 0aPalestine 0awater prices 0awater management0 tAgricultural water management.g2009 Sept., v. 96, no. 9 p.1344-1350dElsevierx0378-37747nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agwat.2009.04.0073Available from publisher's Web site  a20090824b20091002c00000000  aINDd2CTe2009/07/30  aNon-US 7aarticle03903naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003700092040001800129072000900147072000900156072000900165072000900174072000900183100001800192245012300210300001800333500002400351500001500375520226500390650001002655650001602665650002302681650002302704650001302727650002402740650002302764650002102787650001302808650000902821650002102830650002502851650001302876650001602889650002602905650001402931651001202945653001702957653002602974653001003000700002003010700001803030773010003048852000903148856008703157930003303244945002503277946001103302655001203313IND4421431220221120150241.0090605e200909  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442143122DNAL7 a10.1016/j.agwat.2009.04.0162doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aP210 0aP200 0aJ200 0aF110 0aW0001 aMarlet, Serge10aWater and salt balance at irrigation scheme scale: A comprehensive approach for salinity assessment in a Saharan oasis  ap. 1311-1322.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aSalt balance methods are generally applied in the root-zone and at local scales but do not provide relevant information for salinity management at irrigation scheme scales, where there are methodological impediments. A simple salt balance model was developed at irrigation scheme and yearly time scales and applied in Fatnassa oasis (Nefzaoua, Tunisia). It accounts for input by irrigation, export by drainage and groundwater flow, and provides novel computation of the influence of biogeochemical processes and variations in the resident amount of salt for each chemical component in the soil and shallow groundwater. Impediments were overcome by limiting the depth of the system so that the resident amount of salt that remained was of the same order of magnitude as salt inputs and allowed indirect and reliable estimation of groundwater flow. Sensitivity analyses as partial derivatives of groundwater salinity were carried out according to non-reactive salt balance under steady-state assumption. These analyses enabled the magnitude of the salinization process to be foreseen as a function of hydrological changes linked to irrigation, drainage, groundwater flow and extension of the irrigated area. From a salt input of 39Mgha⁻¹ year⁻¹ by irrigation, 21Mgha⁻¹ year⁻¹ (54%) and 10Mgha⁻¹ year⁻¹ (26%) were exported by groundwater flow and drainage, respectively. 7Mgha⁻¹ year⁻¹ (18%) were removed from groundwater by geochemical processes, while a non-significant 2Mgha⁻¹ year⁻¹ were estimated to have been stored in the soil and shallow groundwater where the residence time was only 2.7 years. The leaching efficiency of drainage was estimated at 0.77. With a water supply of 1360mm by irrigation and 90mm by rainfall, drainage, groundwater flow and actual evapotranspiration were 130, 230, and 1090mm, respectively. The current extension of date palm plantations and salinization of groundwater resources are expected to significantly increase the salinity hazard while the degradation of the drainage system is expected to be of lesser impact. The approach was successfully implemented in Fatnassa oasis and proved to be particularly relevant in small or medium irrigation schemes where groundwater fluxes are significant. 3aoases 3arhizosphere 3aevapotranspiration 3airrigation systems 3asalinity 3aPhoenix dactylifera 3awater salinization 3agroundwater flow 3aleaching 3arain 3airrigation rates 3aenvironmental impact 3adrainage 3agroundwater 3abiogeochemical cycles 3ahalf life 3aTunisia 0asalt balance 0airrigation management 0adates1 aBouksila, Fethi1 aBahri, Akissa0 tAgricultural water management.g2009 Sept., v. 96, no. 9 p.1311-1322dElsevierx0378-37747nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agwat.2009.04.0163Available from publisher's Web site  a20090824b20091002c00000000  aINDd2CTe2009/07/30  aNon-US 7aarticle03418naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092040001800130100001800148245017700166300001800343520194600361650002502307650002502332650000902357650002402366650001602390650001002406650001102416650001602427650001002443650002202453650001902475650002402494650001302518650001902531650001202550650001202562650000902574650001902583700001602602700002002618700002102638700002102659700002302680773017302703856005102876852000902927655001202936IND4534725220221120130019.0150928s2015    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND453472522DNAL7 a10.4315/0362-028X.JFP-14-3962doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEnache, Elena10aDevelopment of a Dry Inoculation Method for Thermal Challenge Studies in Low-Moisture Foods by Using Talc as a Carrier for Salmonella and a Surrogate (Enterococcus faecium)  ap. 1106-1112.  aThe objective of this study was to obtain dry inocula of Salmonella Tennessee and Enterococcus faecium, a surrogate for thermal inactivation of Salmonella in low-moisture foods, and to compare their thermal resistance and stability over time in terms of survival. Two methods of cell growth were compared: cells harvested from a lawn on tryptic soy agar (TSA-cells) and from tryptic soy broth (TSB-cells). Concentrated cultures of each organism were inoculated onto talc powder, incubated at 35°C for 24 h, and dried for additional 24 h at room temperature (23 ± 2°C) to achieve a final water activity of ≤0.55 before sieving. Cell reductions of Salmonella and E. faecium during the drying process were between 0.14 and 0.96 log CFU/g, depending on growth method used. There was no difference between microbial counts at days 1 and 30. Heat resistance of the dry inoculum on talc inoculated into a model peanut paste (50 % fat and 0.6 water activity) was determined after 1 and 30 days of preparation, using thermal death time tests conducted at 85°C. For Salmonella, there was no significant difference between the thermal resistance (D 85°C) for the TSB-cells and TSA-cells (e.g. day 1 cells D 85° C = 1.05 and 1.07 min, respectively), and there was no significant difference in D 85°C between dry inocula on talc used either 1 or 30 days after preparation (P > 0.05). However, the use the dry inocula of E. faecium yielded different results: the TSB-grown cells had a significantly (P < 0.05) greater heat resistance than TSA-grown cells (e.g. D 85°C for TSB-cells = 3.42 min versus 2.60 min for TSA-cells). E. faecium had significantly (P < 0.05) greater heat resistance than Salmonella Tennessee regardless what cell type was used for dry inoculum preparation; therefore, it proved to be a conservative but appropriate surrogate for thermal inactivation of Salmonella in low-moisture food matrices under the tested conditions. 3aEnterococcus faecium 3aSalmonella Tennessee 3aagar 3aambient temperature 3acell growth 3adeath 3adrying 3afood matrix 3afoods 3aheat inactivation 3aheat tolerance 3ainoculation methods 3ainoculum 3alawns and turf 3apeanuts 3asieving 3atalc 3awater activity1 aKataoka, Ai1 aBlack, D.

To contribute to this challenge, the nitrate pollution problem of groundwater wells in the small scale farming systems of the Niayes region in Senegal is assessed and explained in terms of well characteristics and land use properties. A field campaign was performed in 2007 to collect basic background data of the small scale farming systems and well water was analysed in 131 wells for nitrate content, pH and electrical conductivity. For a subset of wells, soil analyses were made of the well environment for assessing the attenuation properties of the protecting soil. Cluster analysis was used to define a well typology, while principal component and multiple correspondence analyses were used to relate the nitrate pollution to well characteristics and land use properties. The study confirms that the wells are seriously affected by the nitrate pollution problem. Wells can be classified in three well classes which exhibit highest nitrate content in the southern part, while the salinity affects particularly the wells in the northern area of the region. The nitrate levels exceeding 50mg/L are more common in residential areas than in the horticultural fields. The results further show that, even if direct pollution problem of wells cannot be excluded, pollution from leaching out of the root zone of vegetable crops to the groundwater is likely. This is confirmed by the assessment of the farming activities in this area and this is consistent with the low attenuation properties of the soils characterizing this region. Considering the nitrate pollution threshold, very few non-polluting crops can be distinguished in this region, which calls for an urgent adoption of agriculture management to protect water resources from further deterioration. 3aelectrical conductivity 3aagricultural soils 3awater quality 3agroundwater contamination 3asmall-scale farming 3aland use 3anitrate nitrogen 3aleaching 3anonpoint source pollution 3apH 3aanthropogenic activities 3agroundwater 3awells 3aSenegal 0awater pollution 0awater management1 aVanclooster, M.0 tAgricultural water management.g2009 Sept., v. 96, no. 9 p.1360-1368dElsevierx0378-37747nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agwat.2009.04.0103Available from publisher's Web site  a20090821b20091002c00000000  aINDd2CTe2009/07/30  aNon-US 7aarticle01801naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002000110245011600130300001600246500001500262520070300277650000900980650002400989650001901013650002201032650002201054650002201076650002501098650001501123650002001138650001301158653002201171653002001193653001701213653002401230700001601254773008001270852000901350939003301359946001101392655001201403IND9206687820221120034055.0921030e199112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920668782DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJohnson, A.K.L.10aDevelopment of a simualtion based land evaluation system using crop modelling, expert systems and risk analysis  ap. 239-245.  a2019-12-04  aCurrent methods of agricultural land evaluation in Queensland and other parts of Australia have been criticized for their inflexibility and lack of attention to costs (both private and social) associated with particular land uses. These deficiencies can limit the usefulness of land evaluation procedures in defining land capability and suitability for farm and regional land use planning. This paper outlines a new method based on soil potential ratings, that incorporates biophysical crop simulation modelling, expert systems and risk analysis. The technique is able to integrate biophysical and economic data in a measure which can be readily computed, updated and communicated to land managers. 3arisk 3aland classification 3aexpert systems 3asimulation models 3aagricultural land 3acosts and returns 3aprobability analysis 3acrop yield 3aland evaluation 3aland use 0aeconomic analysis 0aauscane (model) 0arisk (model) 0afeasibility studies1 aCramb, R.A.0 tSoil use and management.g1991 Dec., v. 7, no. 4 p.239-245x0266-00327nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle01979naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092040001800119100001300137245009500150300001800245520088200263650001601145650001901161650002001180650002101200650002001221650001201241653001401253653004301267700001501310700001801325700001501343773010201358852000901460856007701469930003301546945001301579946001301592655001201605IND2061305820221120034101.0980115e199608  dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND206130582DNAL7 a10.1021/jf950192v2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSnir, R.10aMembrane fouling and molecular weight cutoff effects on the partitioning of pectinesterase  ap. 2091-2095.  aThe effects of membrane fouling and molecular weight cutoff (MWCO) on the partitioning of pectinesterase (PE) isolated from Marsh grapefruit were evaluated. Statistically higher fouling rates were observed for Marsh grapefruit extracts on 30K and 100K poly (sultone) UF membranes than on a similar membrane with a MWCO of 10K. A simple logarithmic expression adequately described the fouling phenomena for all three UF membranes. The permeability of PE was also determined by using the same membranes and found to decrease 30-60% during processing regardless of the MWCO of the membrane. Permeability was found to decrease in a fashion similar to permeate flux. A separate logarithmic expression was developed to evaluate the rate of change of permeability on each of the membranes. About 40-50% of the total activity in the permeate of the 30K UF membrane was thermostable PE. 3agrapefruits 3apectinesterase 3aultrafiltration 3amolecular weight 3afood processing 3afouling 0amembranes 0apolysulfone membrane citrus processing1 aWicker, L.1 aKoehler, P.E.1 aSims, K.A.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g1996 Aug., v. 44, no. 8 p.2091-2095x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf950192v3Available from publisher's Web site  a19980301b19980309c00000000  aINDdLDP  aOther US 7aarticle02190naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002900092040001800121100001900139245013800158300001600296500001500312520093700327650001801264650001101282650001701293650002301310650001401333650002201347650001101369650001301380650001101393650001101404650001801415653002601433653001701459700001501476700001801491773010001509852000901609856007901618930003301697945001301730946001301743655001201756IND2061309220221120022216.0980115e199503  dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND206130922DNAL7 a10.1021/jf00051a0172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEiserich, J.P.10aAntioxidative activities of furan- and thiophenethiols measured in lipid peroxidation systems and by tyrosyl radical scavenging assay  ap. 647-650.  a2019-12-04  aMalonaldehyde formation from dilinolenoylphosphatidylcholine liposomes was inhibited by 2-methyl-3-furanthiol, 2-thiophenethiol, and furfuryl mercaptan. 2-Methyl-3-furanthiol and 2-thiophenethiol showed strong and comparable inhibitory activities, whereas furfuryl mercaptan showed only slight activity. 2-Methyl-3-furanthiol possessed synergistic activity with alpha-tocopherol in the lower concentrations.

It was found that the short-circuit current (ISC), the measure of transepithelial active transport of sodium, decreased up to 30% at an alpha-chaconine concentration of 10 mg/L. alpha-Solanine had a similar but smaller effect, decreasing short-circuit current by 16%. The data suggest that frog skin is a useful experimental model to evaluate effects of glycoalkaloids at the cellular level and the mechanism of action of the two glycoalkaloids is to modify the active transport of sodium. The possible significance of these findings to food safety is discussed. 3aSolanum tuberosum 3achemical composition 3aglycoalkaloids 3asodium 3aion transport 3aactive transport 3amembrane potential 3afood safety1 aAtherton, R.1 aFriedman, M.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g1995 Mar., v. 43, no. 3 p.636-639x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf00051a0153Available from publisher's Web site  a19980201b19980206c00000000  aINDdLDP  aOther US 7aarticle02181naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002900092040001800121100001500139245008900154300001600243520103300259650001101292650001401303650001201317650001601329650002101345650002101366650001501387650001701402650002201419650001901441651001201460653001901472700001501491700001801506773010001524852000901624856007901633930003301712945001301745946001301758655001201771IND2061304620221123025020.0980115e199503  dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND206130462DNAL7 a10.1021/jf00051a0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFuleki, T.10aCarboxylic acid composition of varietal juices produced from fresh and stored apples  ap. 598-607.  aJuices were produced from 11 apple cultivars from three regions of Ontario before and after storage in 2 years and analyzed for acids.

Most commercial juices had acid compositions similar to those of the authentic ones, except fumaric acid was present and quinic, shikimic, and succinic acids were frequently absent. 3aapples 3acultivars 3astorage 3aapple juice 3afood composition 3acarboxylic acids 3aseparation 3afood storage 3aspectral analysis 3agrowing season 3aOntario 0aauthentication1 aPelayo, E.1 aPalabay, R.B.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g1995 Mar., v. 43, no. 3 p.598-607x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf00051a0093Available from publisher's Web site  a19980201b19980206c00000000  aINDdLDP  aOther US 7aarticle02338naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004000092040001800132072000900150072000900159100002100168245009400189300001600283500002400299520089200323650001301215650001401228650001601242650002501258650001801283650002701301650003101328650002301359650001801382650001701400650002701417650002001444653001901464653002801483700001801511700001901529700001701548700001701565773009401582852000901676856009001685930003301775945002501808946001101833655001201844IND4421427720221123015840.0090605e20091015xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442142772DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2009.03.0522doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aX380 0aS0001 aLin, Chuan-Chuan10aStability and characterisation of phospholipid-based curcumin-encapsulated microemulsions  ap. 923-928.  aIncludes references  aThe ternary phase diagram of a curcumin-encapsulated O/W microemulsion system using food-acceptable components, lecithin and Tween 80 as the surfactants and ethyl oleate as the oil phase, was constructed.

It is a natural origin polysaccharide and therefore subject to more or less important variabilities of its properties. This work deals with two similar polysaccharides exuded by Acacia senegal of different history and an Acacia seyal sample. To characterize these samples, wide angle X-ray scattering (WAXS) and thermogravimetric analysis in dynamic and isothermal mode are used. The initial structure checked by X-ray diffraction allows to affirm that samples are equivalent in their crystalline structure. The activation energy used to characterize the main degradation process is the same for A. senegal samples, but higher for the A. seyal gum sample. Differences are furthermore observed for the kinetics of water desorption. We conclude that the samples from the same type of gum (A. senegal) are very similar and that A. seyal exudates can be detected by this technique. The water desorption of the two exudates is different. 3ainterspecific variation 3aAcacia seyal 3achemical degradation 3agum arabic 3aactivation energy 3aSenegalia senegal 3akinetics 3achemical structure 3adesorption 0aspecies differences 0aAcacia senegal 0awater desorption1 aPicton, Luc1 aGarda, Marie-Rose1 aMarlhoux, Franck1 aLe Cerf, Didier0 tFood hydrocolloids.g2009 Oct., v. 23, no. 7 p.1930-1934dElsevier Sciencex0268-005X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodhyd.2009.02.0093Available from publisher's Web site  a20090722b20090801c00000000  aINDd7CTe2009/07/10  aNon-US 7aarticle02406naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131072000900149072000900158100001500167245006700182300001800249500002400267520104400291650002101335650001901356650002801375650002801403650002601431650002201457650001701479650001401496650001701510650001601527650001301543653001301556653002301569700001701592700001801609700001501627700001901642773009601661852000901757856008901766930003301855945002501888946001101913655001201924IND4421424820221122220212.0090605e200910  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442142482DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodhyd.2009.02.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ101 0aQ5011 aPereda, J.10aHeat damage evaluation in ultra-high pressure homogenized milk  ap. 1974-1979.  aIncludes references  aThe evaluation of heat damage in ultra-high pressure homogenized (UHPH)-treated samples has been studied by analyzing different thermal indicators such as compounds that absorb at 340nm, hydroxymethylfurfural, free sulphydryl content, furosine, lactulose and whey protein denaturation. Milk was treated at 200 and 300MPa with inlet temperature of 30 and 40^oC and was compared to high-pasteurized milk (PA; 90^oC, 15s) and to commercial UHT, in bottle-sterilized and pasteurized milks. UHPH samples were differentiated from PA milk, basically by the determination of absorbance at 340nm and @b-Lactoglobulin denaturation. Both parameters indicated a reduced thermal effect in UHPH samples over PA milk. Comparison of UHPH samples with UHT and sterilized milks showed an increase of all heating indicators when severe heat process was applied. Overall, in spite of the increase of temperature during UHPH treatments, heat damage was lower compared to PA milk, suggesting the potential of this technology as an alternative to pasteurization. 3ahomogenized milk 3aheat treatment 3afood processing quality 3ahigh pressure treatment 3ahydroxymethylfurfural 3asulfhydryl groups 3adenaturation 3alactulose 3awhey protein 3atemperature 3apressure 0afurosine 0athermal indicators1 aFerragut, V.1 aQuevedo, J.M.1 aGuamis, B.1 aTrujillo, A.J.0 tFood hydrocolloids.g2009 Oct., v. 23, no. 7 p.1974-1979dElsevier Sciencex0268-005X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodhyd.2009.02.0103Available from publisher's Web site  a20090723b20090801c00000000  aINDd7CTe2009/07/10  aNon-US 7aarticle01856naa a2200289 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002400145245010400169300001600273500002400289520092400313650002801237650002601265650002201291650002201313700002501335700002001360700001701380773010001397852000901497856004801506655001201554IND4432100620221122220334.0100129e201001  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443210062DNAL7 a10.1007/s10682-009-9302-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFitzsimmons, Jay M.10aPopulation consequences of mutational events: effects of antibiotic resistance on the r/K trade-off  ap. 227-236.  aIncludes references  aWhat are the effects of a mutational event on population dynamics? This eco-evolutionary question has relevance not only to basic biological theories but also to conservation applications. We evaluated the relationship between maximum population growth rate (r max) and carrying capacity (K) among strains of the bacterium Pseudomonas fluorescens. Each of 65 strains differed from their common ancestor by one naturally acquired phenotypic change conferring antibiotic resistance, brought about by a single mutational event, and each was grown in isolation in four environments. We found no evidence of a trade-off between r max and K. Rather, strains with rapid growth rates also had high carrying capacity, with little interaction between strain and environment. We conclude that the extensive variation in overall fitness resulting from single mutational events likely masks whatever population trade-offs may exist. 3aPseudomonas fluorescens 3aantibiotic resistance 3acarrying capacity 3apopulation growth1 aSchoustra, Sijmen E.1 aKerr, Jeremy T.1 aKassen, Rees0 tEvolutionary ecology.g2010 Jan., v. 24, no. 1 p.227-236dSpringer Netherlandsx0269-76537nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10682-009-9302-8 7aarticle02482naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002200145245018200167300001600349500002400365520115200389650001501541650001701556650001601573650001801589650001001607650002001617650001001637650002001647650001501667650001201682653001501694653002401709653002101733653002401754653001701778700002601795700002101821700001601842700001801858773010301876852000901979856004801988655001202036IND4438766020221122220409.0100619e201008  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443876602DNAL7 a10.1007/s00040-010-0086-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPérez-Ortega, B.10aBiological notes on a fungus-growing ant, Trachymyrmex cf. zeteki (Hymenoptera, Formicidae, Attini) attacked by a diverse community of parasitoid wasps (Hymenoptera, Diapriidae)  ap. 317-322.  aIncludes references  aA number of wasps in the family Diapriidae, subfamily Diapriinae (Proctotrupoidea), are parasitoids that specialize on ant larvae. These wasps are abundant and diverse in the Neotropics, but little is known about their biology. We studied parasitism rates by an array of diapriine wasps that attack the larvae of fungus-growing ants, Trachymyrmex cf. zeteki, in a single population (near Gamboa, Panamá). Relatively little is known about the biology and natural history of these ants, so we also present data on colony size and nest architecture. We excavated 136 colonies in central Panamá from June to September 2006, and 20 nests from July 2009. We reared six wasp morphotypes; two of them in the genus Mimopriella Masner and Garcia, one Oxypria Kieffer, two Szelenyiopria Fabritius and one Acanthopria Ashmead. The mean intensity of larval parasitism per ant colony was 33.9% (2006), and its prevalence across all ant populations was 27.2% (2006 and 2009). Parasitism rates were not positively correlated with host colony size. A single case of super-parasitism was documented in which two Oxypria males were reared from the same host larva. 3aDiapriidae 3aTrachymyrmex 3acorrelation 3ainsect larvae 3amales 3anatural history 3anests 3aparasitic wasps 3aparasitism 3atropics 0aDiapriinae 0aFungus-growing ants 0aParasitoid wasps 0aAdaptive radiations 0aTrachymyrmex1 aFernández-Marín, H.1 aLoiácono, M.

Significant warming is evident in all 12 evaluated meteorological stations, situated in different parts of Israel. Along the Mediterranean coast, the average annual precipitation and P/PET values remained more or less at the same level. However, more inland, both eastward and southward, precipitation and P/PET trends are declining, indicating increased aridity. Eilat, Beer Sheva and Sedom Pans, situated in the desert, showed the most significant increase in aridity among the 12 meteorological stations we investigated. The relationship between changes in temperature and precipitation showed a negative correlation in all cases except for Eilat, the southernmost and driest part of Israel. The negative correlations for Negba, Kefar Blum, Har Kena'an, Beer Sheva and Sedom Pans are statistically significant. In conclusion, the climate in Israel has become more arid in most regions, except for the coastal plain. 3aarid zones 3aatmospheric precipitation 3acoastal plains 3acoasts 3adeserts 3aevapotranspiration 3ahumidity 3atemperature 3aIsrael1 aBruins, Hendrik J.0 tClimatic change.g2009 Sept., v. 96, no. 1-2 p.63-77dSpringer Netherlandsx0165-00097nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10584-009-9578-2 7aarticle02142naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001400110245011500124300001400239500001500253520116600268650001301434650001801447650001301465650001801478653002401496653001101520653001601531700001601547700001601563700002001579773012701599852000901726930003301735945001301768946001101781655001201792IND2163834920221122145156.0980903e199703  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND216383492DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aForni, E.14aThe influence of sugar composition on the colour stability of osmodehydrofrozen intermediate moisture apricots  ap. 87-94.  a2019-12-05  aOsmodehydrofreezing is a 'combined ' process consisting of osmotic dehydration followed by air dehydration and then freezing. This process has been proposed to obtain intermediate moisture (aw = 0.86) apricot ingredients without sulphur dioxide, having a natural and agreable colour, which could be suitable for different applications. The influence of the syrup composition [sucrose, maltose and sorbitol syrups with the addition of 1% (w/v) ascorbic acid and 0.1% (w/v) sodium chloride as antioxidant] on the chemical-physical properties of osmodehydrofrozen apricot cubes (10 mm) was studied. The effect of the modification of the glass transition temperature (Tg) through the osmotic pretreatment on the ascorbic acid retention and on the colour stability during storage at -20 degrees C was also analysed. The incorporation of different sugars into the apricot cubes modified the percentage distribution of the sugars and their low-temperature phase transitions. The sugar composition of the syrup affected the ascorbic acid retention during air-drying and the colour stability during the frozen storage, with maltose showing the highest protective effect. 3afreezing 3awater content 3aapricots 3aascorbic acid 0aosmotic dehydration 0asugars 0adehydration1 aSormani, A.1 aScalise, S.1 aTorreggiani, D.0 tFood research international.g1997 Mar., v. 30, no. 2 p.87-94aFood research international (Ottawa, Ont.)x0963-99697nnas  aDNAL  a19981102b19981110c00000000  aINDdLDP  aNon-US 7aarticle02003naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002900092040001800121100001400139245011500153300001600268520089600284650001901180650002101199650001301220650001201233650001301245650002301258650002201281650002401303653001401327653002201341700001901363773010001382852000901482856007901491930003301570945001301603946001301616655001201629IND2061325920221122090730.0980115e199503  dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND206132592DNAL7 a10.1021/jf00051a0412doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShu, C.K.10aFormation of 4-alkoxy-gamma-valerolactones from levulinic acid and alcohols during storage at room temperature  ap. 782-784.  aLevulinic acid (LA) is a flavor ingredient used for many products. During the storage of LA in alcohols at room temperature, chemical changes were observed. Specifically, two groups of compounds were formed, esters of LA and 4-alkoxy-gamma-valerolactones. All of these compounds were identified by spectral data and synthesis. Mechanistically, it is proposed that the alcohol reacts reversibly either with the keto group of LA to form 4-alkoxy-gamma-valerolactone via a hemiketal intermediate or with the acid group of LA to form the ester. All of the data obtained from this study suggest that during the initial stages of storage the reactions are kinetically controlled to form the 4-alkoxy-gamma-valerolactone more than the ester; however, as the reactions proceed toward equilibrium, they become thermodynamically controlled to form the ester more than the 4-alkoxy-gamma-valerolactone. 3alevulinic acid 3aflavor compounds 3aalcohols 3astorage 3alactones 3achemical reactions 3aspectral analysis 3areaction mechanisms 0astability 0areaction products1 aLawrence, B.M.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g1995 Mar., v. 43, no. 3 p.782-784x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf00051a0413Available from publisher's Web site  a19980201b19980206c00000000  aINDdLDP  aOther US 7aarticle01972naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127100001900144245007900163300001600242520106700258650002101325650002001346650001601366650002201382650002101404650001201425651001101437700001201448773009601460852000901556930003301565945002501598946001101623655001201634IND4369309720221122061345.0050427e200412  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436930972DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aStephenson, G.10aCommon support for local agriculture in two contrasting Oregon communities  ap. 210-217.  aOne increasingly successful approach to enhancing small farm viability is for farmers to market their products directly to consumers and food-oriented businesses and institutions within their local area. This localized approach to food production and distribution is based on theoretical concepts often articulated as community, local or regional food systems. But is there sufficient consumer support to make local food systems viable? Do communities differ in their potential for developing a local food system based on their dominant socio-economic and/or political characteristics? This study reports on the results of a random mail survey of households in two Oregon communities. Although the two communities contrast socio-economically and politically, they show common but somewhat different support for local agriculture. The results demonstrate the potential for the development of more localized food systems in both communities. However, the type of products, their method of delivery and pricing will likely need to be tailored to fit each community. 3afarmers' markets 3aconsumer demand 3asmall farms 3afood availability 3adirect marketing 3asurveys 3aOregon1 aLev, L.0 tRenewable agriculture and food systems.g2004 Dec., v. 19, no. 4 p.210-217x1742-17057nnas  aDNAL  a20050907b00000000c00000000  aINDdDGXe2005/09/07  aNon-US 7aarticle02745naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110100001900127245011300146300001600259500001500275520156700290650001101857650002001868650001101888650002501899650000901924650002601933650004301959650001802002650001902020650002002039653002202059653001002081653002302091700001702114700001702131773009702148852000902245930003302254945002502287946001102312655001202323IND4431550920221122061251.0100120e200909  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443155092DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Analysis of consumer preferences  ap. 205-213.  a2019-12-06  aVarious products incorporating single aspects of organic production systems such as lower inputs of pesticides, food additives or concentrated animal feed are found on the food market (referred to as low-input products hereafter). In our study, we analyzed how consumers react to low-input products in a purchase simulation with certified organic, conventional and low-input products. In the purchase simulations, each participant was asked to make three consecutive purchase decisions, one each for milk, yogurt and apples. The results of a cluster analysis revealed one cluster with a high preference for organic products and three clusters that featured considerable shares of low-input purchases. The latter clusters, however, were not characterized by a clear preference for low-input products. Rather, they bought mixed baskets of goods, i.e., low-input products in combination with either organic or conventional products. The low-input products in the categories milk, yogurt and apples did thus not necessarily attract the same groups of people. Interestingly, we found that most consumers who chose low-input products in the simulations usually buy those particular products in conventional quality. We conclude that in our study, we found a heterogeneous group of low-input buyers. For the organic sector, communicating the various aspects of organic production might be a promising strategy for gaining new customers. The low-input products in the purchase simulation only featured one special attribute, whereas organic products incorporate several. 3aapples 3afood purchasing 3ayogurt 3aconsumer preferences 3amilk 3alow input agriculture 3aconcentrated animal feeding operations 3aorganic foods 3afood additives 3adecision making 0aconsumer behavior 0afoods 0aconventional foods1 aHeid, Astrid1 aHamm, Ulrich0 tRenewable agriculture and food systems.g2009 Sept., v. 24, no. 3 p.205-213x1742-17057nnas  aDNAL  a20100318b20100403c00000000  aINDd2CTe2010/02/24  aNon-US 7aarticle04233naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127100002200144245012500166300001600291500001500307520298700322650003603309650001903345650001503364650002403379650001203403650002403415650002303439650001803462651001103480651001003491651001503501653002003516653002503536700001603561700001803577700001803595773009603613852000903709930003303718945002503751946001103776655001203787IND4369309520221122053247.0050427e200412  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436930952DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aForte-Gardner, O.10aIncreasing the effectiveness of technology trransfer for conservation cropping systems through research and field design  ap. 199-209.  a2019-12-06  aA survey was conducted in 2002 to measure the success of technology transfered to growers (i.e., changes in attitudes and behaviors) from a long-term, large-scale, integrated cropping systems experiment called the Ralston Project, near Ralston, Washington, USA. Non-irrigated, cereal and oilseed growers who participated in biennial field tours (1996-2000) were mailed a self-administered questionnaire, which asked about: (1) their interest, use and adoption of technology developed or demonstrated in the project; (2) their opinions about the project's collaborators, planning and design; and (3) their overall impressions of the project. One hundred and one eligible growers responded to the questionnaire, for a 55% overall response rate and a 62% completion rate. Survey results confirmed that the Ralston Project field tours were a successful means of technology transfer among participants. Seventy-seven percent of growers found one or more project technologies particularly useful to their own production operation(s). More than 60% conducted independent trials with one or more technologies, with 50% of these trials resulting in permanent adoptions. The project's planning and design had a more positive effect on growers' opinion of the project than the type of collaborations and sources of funding. Specific strategies that had a substantially positive effect on growers' opinions included: (1) the project's 'whole system' treatment design; (2) use of large plots to accommodate field-sized equipment; and (3) collaboration among scientific disciplines and with local growers. Seven variables known to influence the adoption of innovation were also tested against growers' decisions to try any of the project's technology in their own farm operations. Personal character variables influenced individuals' decisions to try project technology more so than environmental conditions. Level of education, previous adoption behavior and average annual rainfall significantly influenced growers' behavior (P<0.05). Our survey population consisted of early users of conservation-based farming technology, primarily innovators and early adopters. The Ralston Project made the greatest impact on current adopters and users of conservation-based farming technology. Interest among non-users was also high enough to suggest that the Ralston Project contributed positively to the diffusion of conservation cropping systems and associated technology into the greater grower community. We discovered from this survey that the planning and execution of field research plays a significant and influential role in transferring more complex, and perhaps high-risk, conservation-based farm technology. By understanding how research and field design affect different user groups within the grower community, professionals can identify appropriate strategies to expand interest beyond their primary target audience and influence attitudes and behaviors that facilitate widespread adoption. 3aintegrated agricultural systems 3aquestionnaires 3ano-tillage 3ainnovation adoption 3astubble 3atechnology transfer 3afarmers' attitudes 3acrop rotation 3aOregon 3aIdaho 0aWashington 0aRalston Project 0aconservation tillage1 aYoung, F.L.1 aDillman, D.A.1 aCarroll, M.S.0 tRenewable agriculture and food systems.g2004 Dec., v. 19, no. 4 p.199-209x1742-17057nnas  aDNAL  a20050907b00000000c00000000  aINDdDGXe2005/09/07  aNon-US 7aarticle02104naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002900092040001800121100001600139245008600155300001800241520094600259650001801205650002501223650001401248650001901262650001001281650001101291650001401302650002401316651001401340653001701354653001601371653001701387653002401404700001701428773010201445852000901547856007901556930003301635945001301668946001301681655001201694IND2061317120221122053047.0980115e199504  dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND206131712DNAL7 a10.1021/jf00052a0432doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKnuth, M.L.10aDistribution and persistence of diflubenzuron within littoral enclosure mesocosms  ap. 1087-1097.  aThe insecticide diflubenzuron was applied as Dimilin 25W twice, 32 days apart, to the surfaces of 12 of 18 littoral enclosure mesocosms (5 x 10 m) to study its distribution, persistence, and mass balance in a natural ecosystem.

  1 aBrown, C.14aThe importance of farmers' markets for West Virginia direct marketers  ap. 20-29.  aIn the winter of 2004-2005, over 300 of West Virginia's farmers' market vendors were surveyed with regard to sales levels, promotional techniques and operational characteristics such as hours worked, types of products produced and length of season. Vendors were categorized based on part-time, full-time or retired status, and full-time farmers, both with and without off-farm jobs, were found to be distinct from part-time and retired vendors with respect to 2004 total farmers' market sales and the percentage of household income from farmers' markets. Econometric analysis [ordinary least squares (OLS)] was performed to identify the impact of explanatory variables on total farmers' market sales, percentage of household income from farmers' market sales and amount of household income from farmers' market sales. Independent variables such as bargaining, cost-plus pricing, selling at markets outside West Virginia and providing print materials were found to have a positive impact on annual sales. The number of products produced, distance traveled to market and number of weeks at market were also positively related to the percentage of income obtained from farmers' market sales. Both part-time and retired producers received a lower percentage of household income from farmers' markets relative to full-time producers. Retired and part-time, along with limited-resource vendors (with annual household income less than $20,000) were also found to have lower total sales in the 2004 season. Identifying the characteristics associated with greater farmers' market sales and a higher reliance on such sales for household income will help in the sustained success of markets as engines of economic development and small farm viability. 3afarmers 3afarmers' markets 3aeconomic impact 3afarm income 3afood marketing 3afarm labor 3aseasonal variation 3aoff-farm employment 3ahousehold income 3aeconometric models 3afood prices 3asmall farms 3arural development 3aWest Virginia 0acost-plus pricing 0abargaining1 aMiller, S.M.1 aBoone, D.A.1 aBoone, H.N.

The concentrations of compounds were calculated using external standards that conformed to linear behavior. Most of compounds identified in saps, concentrates, and syrups were related to lignin derivatives. Statistical analyses of data showed that 5-(hydroymethyl)-2-furaldehyde (HMF) concentrations and phenolic profiles were significantly different as related to harvest time and maple products. Although HMF concentrations were not significantly different as related to the producers, a highly significant difference was observed for phenolic profiles. An increase in the relative proportion of phenolic acids and a decrease in that of aldehydes and alcohols were observed during the reverse osmosis of maple sap. The thermal evaporation resulted in an increase in the amount of HMF, ferulic acid, vanillin, and syringyl aldehyde with a concomitant drastic decrease in sinapic acid. 3amaple syrup 3afood composition 3afood analysis 3aphenolic compounds 3afurfural 3aseparation 3aanalysis of variance 3achemical structure 3aharvest date 3afood processing 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 0aultraviolet spectroscopy 0aelectrometric methods 0aidentification 0aultraviolet diode array 0aelectrochemical detector1 aGoetghebeur, M.1 aDumont, J.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g1995 Mar., v. 43, no. 3 p.708-716x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf00051a0283Available from publisher's Web site  a19980201b19980206c00000000  aINDdLDP  aOther US 7aarticle01424naa a2200277 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097245004900115300001200164520064800176650000900824650001600833650002800849650002300877650003900900650002300939653003700962773007200999852000901071939003301080945000801113946001301121655001201134991610823000742620221121233004.0880603e19870730xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI880010612DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL10aCholesterol campaign: zealots or scientists?  ap. 4-5.  aA brief report describes a controversy associated with the reported mounting national cholesterol-lowering campaign by the US National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute before recent events had been questioned by heart experts and the medical community, arguing that advocated changes in dietary practices would have substantial economic consequences with the possibility of not lowering health risks.

Numerous active compounds isolated from Brazilian Cerrado plant species have been studied with promising results. Aim of the study: To investigate the cytotoxic potential of 412 extracts from Brazilian Cerrado plants used in traditional medicine belonging to 21 families against tumor cell lines in culture. Material and method: Maceration of 50 plant species resulted in 412 hexane, dichloromethane, ethanol and hydroalcohol extracts. The cytotoxicity of the extracts was tested against human colon carcinoma (HCT-8), melanoma (MDA-MB-435), and brain (SF-295) tumor cell lines, using the thiazolyl blue test (MTT) assay. Bioassay-guided fractionation was performed for one active extract. Results and Conclusions: Twenty-eight of the 412 tested extracts demonstrated a substantial antiproliferative effect, at least 85% inhibition of cell proliferation at 50μg/mL against one or more cell lines. Those extracts are obtained from different parts of Anacardiaceae, Annonaceae, Apocynaceae, Clusiaceae, Flacourtiaceae, Sapindaceae, Sapotaceae, Simaroubaceae and Zingiberaceae. Complete dose-response curves were generated and IC₅₀ values were calculated for these active extracts against four cell lines HCT-8, MDA-MB-435, SF-295 and HL-60 (leukemia), and their direct cytotoxic effects were determined. In summary, 14 extracts of 13 species showed toxicity in all tested tumor cell lines, with IC₅₀ values ranging from 0.1 to 19.1μg/mL. The strongest cytotoxic activity was found for the hexane extract of Casearia sylvestris var. lingua stem bark, with an IC₅₀ of 0.1μg/mL for HCT-8, 0.9μg/mL for SF-295, 1.2μg/mL for MDA-MB-435, and 1.3μg/mL for HL-60, and Simarouba versicolor root bark, with an IC₅₀ of 0.5μg/mL for HCT-8, 0.7μg/mL for SF-295, 1.5μg/mL for MDA-MB-435, 1.1μg/mL for HL-60. Bioassay-guided fractionation of the last extract led to the isolation of glaucarubinone, which showed pronounced activity against the four cell lines studied. Further studies of the active extracts are necessary for chemical characterization of the active compounds and more extensive biological evaluations. 3atraditional medicine 3ainhibitory concentration 50 3ahuman cell lines 3afractionation 3adose response 3aethnobotany 3aneoplasms 3acytotoxicity 3amedicinal plants 3aplant extracts 3abioassays 3adosage 3acell proliferation 3aanticarcinogenic activity 2aMagnoliopsidaxchemistry. 2aAntineoplastic Agents, Phytogenicxpharmacologyxtherapeutic use. 2aCasearia 2aCell Line, Tumor 2aDose-Response Relationship, Drug 2aDrug Screening Assays, Antitumor 2aEcosystem 2aGlaucarubinxanalogs & derivativesxisolation & purificationxpharmacologyxtherapeutic use. 2aHumans 2aInhibitory Concentration 50 2aMedicine, Traditional 2aNeoplasmsxdrug therapy 2aPhytotherapy 2aPlant Extractsxpharmacologyxtherapeutic use. 2aPlant Structures 2aPlants, Medicinalxchemistry 2aSimarouba 3aBrazil 0aBrazil 0abrain tumors 0acultured cells 0amedicinal properties1 aPaula, José Elias de.1 aPessoa, Cláudia1 ade Moraes, Manoel Odorico1 aCosta-Lotufo, Letícia Veras1 aGrougnet, Raphael1 aMichel, Sylvie1 aTillequin, François1 aEspindola, Laila Salmen0 tJournal of ethnopharmacology.g2009 June 25, v. 123, no. 3 p.439-445dElsevierx0378-87417nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jep.2009.03.0183Available from publisher's Web site  a20090911b20091002c00000000  aINDd2CTe2009/08/18  aNon-US 7aarticle03078naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100002300137245012900160300001600289520157700305592002801882650001101910650001201921650001901933650002901952650001201981650001901993650002802012650001102040650001902051650002102070650001102091650000702102650001102109650002302120650001502143650001302158650001702171650001002188650001802198650002202216650001802238653001602256653002002272653001502292653001602307653001702323653002802340700002502368773008402393856003802477852000902515655001202524IND50063012620221122184558.0130324s2012    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006301262DNAL7 a10.1071/SR121972doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVisconti, Fernando10aPrediction of the soil saturated paste extract salinity from extractable ions, cation exchange capacity, and anion exclusion  ap. 536-550.  aProcess-based models could be used to predict the soil saturated extract salinity from extractable ion contents. However, a rigorous validation of such models for this purpose had not been carried out. A process-based model to predict the main inorganic ion composition, electrical conductivity, and pH of the saturated paste extract from extractable ion contents was developed step by step. The model development started from the principle of matter conservation in the soil solution as it concentrates from the 1:5 to the saturated paste extract. The need to include new hypotheses in the model was studied through calculation and analysis of standardised differences between measurements and model predictions. Therefore, best estimates of saturation paste extract properties occurred after taking into account the following: (i) free equilibration of the soil solution with the minerals calcite and gypsum under CO2 partial pressure of the saturated paste; (ii) further equilibration of the soil solution with the exchange complex; and (iii) determination of salt contents within the diffuse double layer (DDL) of the soil colloids, i.e. the anion exclusion. The last was necessary because the extracts where the determination of soil extractable anions (1:5 extracts), cations, and cation exchange capacity (CEC) were carried out were separated from their suspensions through centrifugation. Therefore, the reliable prediction of soil saturated paste extract salinity demands data on soil extractable ion contents, CEC, and the quantification of salts within the DDL.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanions 3acalcite 3acarbon dioxide 3acation exchange capacity 3acations 3acentrifugation 3aelectrical conductivity 3agypsum 3ainorganic ions 3amodel validation 3amodels 3apH 3apastes 3apasting properties 3aprediction 3asalinity 3asalt content 3asalts 3asoil colloids 3asoil conservation 3asoil solution 0aagriculture 0acalcareous soil 0airrigation 0a1:5 extract 0aSALSOLCHEMEC 0astandardised difference1 aMiguel de Paz, José0 tSoil research.g2012, v. 50, no. 7 p.536-550dCSIRO Publishingx1838-675X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1071/SR12197  aDNAL 7aarticle03005naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245010100165300001600266520174300282592002802025650001902053650001302072650001102085650001402096650001402110650001702124650004302141650001102184650001202195650002602207650001002233650001402243651001202257700002202269700001902291700001902310700002302329700001802352773011102370856008102481852000902562655001202571IND60121439620221120030822.0150303e201503  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012143962DNAL7 a10.1007/s10722-014-0171-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBeharav, Alex10aVariation of sesquiterpene lactone contents in Lactuca georgica natural populations from Armenia  ap. 431-441.  aA comparative phytochemical study of seven sesquiterpene lactones in natural populations of the wild lettuce Lactuca georgica Grossh. (Asteraceae) was performed, based on 17 accessions derived from seven localities representing three regions in Armenia. The compounds were profiled and quantified in roots and leaves of the plants, grown from achenes (cypselas) in a glasshouse under controlled conditions. The contents of major sesquiterpene lactones were estimated in the plant materials by HPLC/PDA, including the germacranolide glucoside—lactuside A and the guaianolides: lactucin, 11β,13-dihydrolactucin, its three esters (at C-8) with acetic, p-hydroxyphenylacetic and methacrylic acids and its 15-O-glucoside (cichorioside B). The plant roots could be characterized by the occurrence of lactuside A and two 11β,13-dihydrolactucin derivatives (acetate and methacrylate) in relatively high amounts. Lactucin and 11β,13-dihydrolactucin were major sesquiterpene constituents in the plant leaves. An analysis of quantitative results of these seven constituents led to the following conclusions: (1) the sesquiterpene lactone contents varied widely, mostly between-populations for root samples, but mostly within-populations for leaf samples, (2) these differences are likely to be genetically controlled since all accessions were grown under standardized glasshouse conditions. This study is probably the first report of detailed screening of L. georgica natural populations and individuals for any trait. The obtained results show that L. georgica, a species within the primary lettuce gene pool, should be considered as an attractive source of germplasm in further research and improvement of cultivated lettuce (Lactuca sativa).  aPublisher supplied data 3aLactuca sativa 3aacetates 3afruits 3agene pool 3agermplasm 3aguaianolides 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3aleaves 3alettuce 3aquantitative analysis 3aroots 3ascreening 3aArmenia1 aStojakowska, Anna1 aBen-David, Roi1 aMalarz, Janusz1 aMichalska, Klaudia1 aKisiel, Wanda0 tGenetic resources and crop evolution.g2015 Mar., v. 62, no. 3 p.431-441dSpringer-Verlagx0925-98647nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10722-014-0171-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02831naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001900152245016000171300001800331520130500349592002801654650002201682650002001704650002401724650001701748650002101765650001401786650001501800650001301815650003101828650003201859650000901891650001401900650001701914650001701931650001801948653002801966653000801994653002402002700006002026700002302086700002202109773013402131856008702265852000902352655001202361IND60613142220221122231718.0220222e201812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061314222DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2018.08.1182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAli, Ehab M.M.10aMethotrexate loaded on magnetite iron nanoparticles coated with chitosan: Biosynthesis, characterization, and impact on human breast cancer MCF-7 cell line  ap. 1170-1180.  aMethotrexate (MTX) is effective therapeutic agent treated many tumors and autoimmune diseases. The aim of our study was to design an effective delivery nanocarrier for methotrexate to improve stability and biodistribution, reduce adverse effects and maximize clinical efficacy. Magnetite nanoparticles (Fe₃O₄-NPs) were synthesized using Pterocladiella. The size of Fe₃O₄-NPs, CS-Fe₃O₄-NPs and MTX/CS-Fe₃O₄-NPs were 37.6, 61.4 and 150 nm respectively. Methotrexate loading efficiency was 74.15% of total amount of MTX loaded on CS-Fe₃O₄-NPs and 39.8% of the loaded drug was initially released and the remaining amount was released through 120 h. The IC₅₀ of MTX and MTX/CS-Fe₃O₄-NPs was 51.4 and 9.7 μg/ml respectively after 72 h. MTX/CS-Fe₃O₄-NPs caused remarkable damage to the membrane of MCF-7 cells led to increasing the LDH activity 5 fold in MCF-7 cells as compared with MTX treated once. DNA fragmentation and caspase-3 activity were higher in MCF-7 cells treated with MTX/CS-Fe₃O₄-NPs than that of MTX. Up-regulation of caspase3 and DHFR genes expression was observed in the treatment with MTX/CS-Fe₃O₄-NPs. The loading of MTX on chitosan coated Fe₃O₄-NPs improves the release and anticancer efficacy of MTX for effective cancer treatment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA fragmentation 3aadverse effects 3aautoimmune diseases 3abiosynthesis 3abreast neoplasms 3acaspase-3 3acell lines 3achitosan 3agene expression regulation 3ainhibitory concentration 50 3airon 3amagnetite 3amethotrexate 3ananocarriers 3ananoparticles 0aMagnetite nanoparticles 0aMTX 0aAnticancer efficacy1 aElashkar, Aya A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0246-73201 aEl-Kassas, Hala Y.1 aSalim, Elsayed I.0 tInternational journal of biological macromolecules.g2018 Dec., v. 120 p.1170-1180dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12340x0141-81307nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2018.08.1183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02452naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245010800168300001600276520111600292592002801408650001401436650001501450650002801465650002601493650001201519650001301531650001501544650002401559650001901583650003401602650002201636650002101658653001601679653002401695653002201719653002401741653002201765700001901787700001701806773012301823856005101946852000901997655001202006IND50087511920221120055948.0140412e20120701xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5008751192DNAL7 a10.1080/00405000.2011.6032032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhao, Ya-Ping10aEffect of polymeric additives on the formation and properties of polyaniline films on polyester fabrics  ap. 724-732.  aElectrically conductive films based on polyaniline (PANI) and polyethylene glycol (PEG) molecules of different chain length were synthesized on polyester textiles (PET) through in situ polymerization. Fabric supports were placed in the monomer bath in the presence of polymeric additive firstly and then immersed into the oxidant solution to initiate the reaction. Influence of the PEG segment length on monomer adsorption process toward fabrics was investigated by comparing the adsorption thermodynamic parameters. The polymeric layers’ morphologies have been evaluated using the field emission scanning electron microscope, and the film formation mechanism has been investigated. Compositions of the films synthesized in the absence and presence of PEG were characterized by attenuated total reflection Fourier transform infrared. The electrical resistance measurement results indicated that the electrical conductivity of PET/PANI–PEG composite fabrics decreases slowly as the PEG segments length increased, and the thermal stability was improved slightly according to thermogravimetric analysis values.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadditives 3aadsorption 3aelectrical conductivity 3aelectrical resistance 3afabrics 3aoxidants 3apolyesters 3apolyethylene glycol 3apolymerization 3ascanning electron microscopes 3athermal stability 3athermogravimetry 0apolyaniline 0apolyethylene glycol 0apolyester fabrics 0aelectrical property 0athermal stability1 aCai, Zai-Sheng1 aFu, Xiao-Lan0 tThe journal of the Textile Institute.g2012 July 1, v. 103, no. 7 p.724-732dRoutledgewJournal:23052x1754-23407nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00405000.2011.603203  aDNAL 7aarticle02194naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002200152245013500174520097500309592002801284650001201312650001301324650001301337650002001350650001501370653002201385653003101407653001901438653001101457653001701468700001801485700001701503700001801520700002001538700002201558700001501580773010501595856008701700852000901787655001201796IND60772501620221120205843.0220421e202205  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077250162DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biortech.2022.1271092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMaurya, Annapurna10aBiofilm formation and extracellular polymeric substance (EPS) production by Bacillus haynesii and influence of hexavalent chromium  aBiofilm-forming bacteria play a key role in the removal of heavy metals including hexavalent chromium [Cr(VI)] from contaminated sites.

Exposure of B. haynesii with Cr(VI) (12.5–100 mg L⁻¹) for 48 h enhanced pellicle dry weight (20–24%), cell-size (5.1–23.2%) and cell granularity (8.5–19.2%). Also, EPS production was increased by 10–35% by promoting the synthesis of protein (94–119%) and polysaccharide (2–33%) components in EPS. Further, the reduction (27.7 %) and distribution (15.87%) of Cr(VI) were mainly mediated by EPS than the other cellular fractions. Findings of the study suggest that the EPS from B. haynesii was efficiently reduced to Cr(VI) present in aqueous medium and the potential of the organism can be further explored for the mitigation of Cr(VI) contamination.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiofilm 3achromium 3apolymers 3apolysaccharides 3atechnology 0aBacillus haynesii 0aPellicle biofilm formation 0aEPS production 0aCr(VI) 0aBioreduction1 aKumar, Rajesh1 aYadav, Pooja1 aSingh, Anjali1 aYadav, Ashutosh1 aChowdhary, Pankaj1 aRaj, Abhay0 tBioresource technology.g2022 May, v. 352 p.127109-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46263x0960-85247nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2022.1271093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02435naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002400094040001800118100002000136245009300156300001600249520127200265592002801537650002101565650001501586650002701601650002001628650001301648650001801661650001401679650001901693650000901712650001301721650002201734650001801756650001301774700001901787700001601806773013401822856007201956852000902028655001202037IND60127614620221122013814.0151110e201206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012761462DNAL7 a10.1670/11-0722doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKerby, Jacob L.10aImpacts of the Insecticide Diazinon on the Behavior of Predatory Fish and Amphibian Prey  ap. 171-176.  aWe examined the combined effects of sublethal concentrations of the pesticide diazinon and a nonnative predatory fish on the behavior and survival of amphibian prey. A 48-h experiment was performed in tubs containing predatory Western Mosquitofish and diazinon treatments (0, 0.5, 1.0 mg/L, and a solvent control). In “no-pesticide” treatments, the presence of fish reduced tadpole survival significantly. In the absence of fish, pesticide presence altered tadpole behavior (reduced refuge use) significantly but did not impact tadpole survival. In the combined presence of both fish and pesticide, tadpoles altered their behavior to become more active, and to hide less. Although these behavioral changes should expose tadpoles to an even higher predation risk, because diazinon also reduced both activity and attack rates by the predatory fish, tadpoles experienced significantly greater survival in treatments with pesticides. Despite the negative impact of diazinon on amphibian antipredator behavior, the stronger impact of diazinon on predator behavior allowed a greater survival rate for the prey. These results demonstrate the importance of studying specific species interactions in understanding the impacts of chemical contaminants on any given species.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGambusia affinis 3aamphibians 3aantipredatory behavior 3abehavior change 3adiazinon 3afish behavior 3apredation 3apredatory fish 3arisk 3asolvents 3asublethal effects 3asurvival rate 3atadpoles1 aWehrmann, Anja1 aSih, Andrew0 tJournal of Herpetology.g2012 June, v. 46, no. 2 p.171-176dthe Society for the Study of Amphibians and Reptilesx0022-15117nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1670%2F11-0723Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02788naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001800155245009600173520137500269592002801644650002301672650001601695650001901711650002201730650000901752650001801761650001601779650000701795650001301802653001701815653001201832653001001844653001301854653001901867653001701886653001801903653001101921700002301932700002001955700001701975700001701992700001902009700001702028700002102045700001802066773009902084856009002183852000902273655001202282IND60775963520221122042401.0220517e20220715xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077596352DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aquaculture.2022.7383012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTsertou, M.I.10aComparative study of Chronic Ulcerative Dermatopathy in cultured meagre, Argyrosomus regius  aChronic Ulcerative Dermatopathy (CUD) is a disease that affects all cultured meagre when reared in facilities supplied with borehole water, resulting in ulceration of the skin overlying the lateral line canals. The aims of this study were (i) to describe the morphogenesis of the cephalic lateral line, (ii) to investigate the effect of the use of borehole water vs natural seawater in the development of the disease, (iii) to assess the recovery of the lesions and (iv) to evaluate the effect of CO₂ and pH on the development of CUD. The development of the lateral line canals in the head was completed by day 28 post hatching when fish were 19.3 mm in total length, while the source of the water did not affect the developmental process. The characteristic lesions of CUD were induced when meagre were reared in borehole water, while the lesions were resolved when fish were transferred to natural seawater. Lesions were macroscopically visible by day 56 post hatching. Moreover, significant differences in the expression of genes regulating osteoclast's activity were observed between healthy and CUD-affected fish, while neither pH nor CO₂ were involved in the development of the disease. Finally, higher concentrations of heavy metals were found in the heads of CUD-affected meagres reared in borehole water compared to healthy fish reared in natural seawater.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArgyrosomus regius 3aaquaculture 3acarbon dioxide 3acomparative study 3afish 3amorphogenesis 3aosteoclasts 3apH 3aseawater 0aLateral line 0aerosion 0aUlcer 0amicro-CT 0aHistopathology 0aHeavy metals 0aWater quality 0aMeagre1 aPapandroulakis, N.1 aKeklikoglou, K.1 aKalantzi, I.1 aTsapakis, M.1 aTsalafouta, A.1 aPavlidis, M.1 aAntonopoulou, E.1 aKatharios, P.0 tAquaculture.g2022 July 15, v. 556 p.738301-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl59663x0044-84867nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquaculture.2022.7383013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03261naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245011500159300001600274500001500290520186500305592002802170650001802198650001902216650002402235650001802259650001802277650000902295650001502304650001802319650001702337650000902354650002202363650001602385650003102401650001702432650001502449653001902464700002002483700001902503700002702522700001802549700001302567773011602580856007402696852000902770655001202779IND60342793120221120211335.0150810e201507  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6034279312DNAL7 a10.1111/ejss.122652doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDhawale, N.

The objectives of this research were to evaluate a prototype portable mid‐IR spectrometer for direct measurements of soil reflectance and to model the spectra to predict sand, clay and soil organic matter (SOM) contents under a range of field soil water conditions. Soil samples were collected from 23 locations at different depths in four agricultural fields to represent a range of soil textures, from sands to clay loams. The particle size distribution and SOM content of 48 soil samples were measured in the laboratory by conventional analytical methods. In addition to air‐dry soil, each sample was wetted with two different amounts of water before the spectroscopic measurements were made. The prototype spectrometer was used to measure reflectance (R) in the range between 1811 and 898 cm⁻¹ (approximately 5522 to 11 136 nm). The spectroscopic measurements were recorded randomly and in triplicate, resulting in a total of 432 reflectance spectra (48 samples × three soil water contents × three replicates). The spectra were transformed to log₁₀ (1/R) and mean centred for the multivariate statistical analyses. The 48 samples were split randomly into a calibration set (70%) and a validation set (30%). A partial least squares regression (PLSR) was used to develop spectroscopic calibrations to predict sand, clay and SOM contents. Results show that the portable spectrometer can be used with PLSR to predict clay and sand contents of either wet or dry soil samples with a root mean square error (RMSE) of around 10%. Predictions of SOM content resulted in RMSE values that ranged between 0.76 and 2.24%.  aPublisher supplied data 3asand fraction 3asemiconductors 3asoil organic matter 3aspectrometers 3aleast squares 3aclay 3asoil water 3asoil sampling 3asoil texture 3asand 3aspectral analysis 3areflectance 3aparticle size distribution 3aspectroscopy 3aprediction 0aorganic matter1 aAdamchuk, V.

Mcl-diols are currently synthesized through energy intensive chemical process. Recently, esterified diols have been produced from n-alkanes in E. coli by co-expression of the alkane monooxygenase module (AlkBGTL) and the esterification module (Atf1), thereby establishing the technical feasibility of the process. However, esterified diols need to be hydrolyzed for further applications. In this study, we developed bio-catalysts for mcl-diol production from n-alkanes under mild conditions. The engineered P. putida KT2440 with overexpression of Est12 can efficiently hydrolyze esterified diols (C₆-C₁₀). Later, the engineered strain was co-cultured with an E. coli strain (AlkBGTL-Atf1) to produce mcl-diols. In a two-stage approach, 5 mM 1,6-hexanediol was produced, 61.5 times of one-stage test, from n-hexane by biocatalysts for the first time. In conclusion, the present work indicates that bio-catalysis offers a green biobased alternative for synthesis of mcl-diols.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aEscherichia coli 3abiocatalysts 3acoculture 3aenergy 3aesterification 3aglycols 3ahexane 0aMedium-chain-length diols 0aMonooxygenase 0aEsterase 0aPseudomonas putida 0aBiocatalyst1 aLeitner, Nina1 aWijffels, Rene H.1 aMartins dos Santos, Vitor A.P.1 aWeusthuis, Ruud A.0 tBioresource technology.g2022 May, v. 352 p.127111-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46263x0960-85247nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2022.1271113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03033naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002900147245008100176300001600257520177500273592002802048650001602076650001002092650001402102650002002116650001202136650001802148650001102166650002402177650001102201650001502212650002202227650002102249651001102270700002902281700002702310700002802337700002302365773013202388856008202520852000902602655001202611IND60124387620221119043907.0190724e201505  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012438762DNAL7 a10.1007/s00704-014-1182-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlvares, Clayton Alcarde10aModeling temporal and spatial variability of leaf wetness duration in Brazil  ap. 455-467.  aLeaf wetness duration (LWD) is recognized as a very important conditioner of crops and forests diseases, but clearly, there is a considerable gap in literature on temporal models for prediction of LWD in broad regions from standard meteorological data. The objective of this study was to develop monthly LWD models based on the relationship between hours of relative humidity (RH) ≥ 90 % and average RH for Brazil and based on these models to characterize the temporal and spatial LWD variability across the country. Two different relative humidity databases, being one in an hourly basis (RHₕ) and another in a monthly basis (RHₘ), were used. To elaborate the LWD models, 58 automatic weather stations distributed across the country were selected. Monthly LWD maps for the entire country were prepared, and for that, the RHₘ from the 358 conventional weather stations were interpolated using geostatistical techniques. RHₘ and LWD showed sigmoidal relationship with determination coefficient above 0.84 and were highly significant (p < 0.0001). In relation to the validation of the LWD monthly models, a very good performance for all months was obtained, with very high precision with r between 0.92 and 0.96. Regarding the errors, mean error showed a slight tendency of overestimation during February (0.29 h day⁻¹), May (0.31 h day⁻¹), July (0.14 h day⁻¹), and August (0.34 h day⁻¹), whereas for the other months, the tendency was of underestimation like January (−0.27 h day⁻¹) and March (−0.25 h day⁻¹). Even as a first approach, the results presented here represent a great advance in the climatology of LWD for Brazil and will allow the development of studies related to crop and forest diseases control plans.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclimatology 3acrops 3adatabases 3adisease control 3aforests 3ageostatistics 3aleaves 3ameteorological data 3amodels 3aprediction 3arelative humidity 3aweather stations 3aBrazil1 ade Mattos, Eduardo Moré1 aSentelhas, Paulo Cesar1 aMiranda, Aline Cristina1 aStape, José Luiz,0 tTheoretical and applied climatology.g2015 May, v. 120, no. 3-4 p.455-467dSpringer ViennawJournal:jnl3932171x0177-798X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00704-014-1182-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03004naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001500139245020500154300001600359520137700375592002801752650002501780650002301805650002101828650002501849650001601874650001001890650000901900650002301909650002001932650002001952650001401972650002701986650001902013650001402032650001302046650002902059650001402088650001402102650001702116650002502133650001602158700001302174700001402187700001302201700001102214700001502225700001502240700001502255773009802270856007302368852000902441655001202450IND60342793420221120211300.0150810e201508  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6034279342DNAL7 a10.1111/anu.121712doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, L.G.10aEffect of oxidized fish oil and α‐tocopherol on growth, antioxidation status, serum immune enzyme activity and resistance to Aeromonas hydrophila challenge of Chinese mitten crab Eriocheir sinensis  ap. 414-424.  aThe impact of dietary α‐tocopherol on juvenile Chinese mitten crab Eriocheir sinensis was experimentally evaluated in a 10‐week study. Crab were fed with nine diets including three levels of α‐tocopherol (0, 100 and 300 mg kg⁻¹ diet) and three levels of fish oil oxidation (fresh, moderate and high) in triplicates. Fresh and moderate oil oxidization enhanced weight gain, but moderate and high oil oxidization lowered survival and feed efficiency. The 100‐mg α‐tocopherol kg⁻¹ diet resulted in higher hepatopancreas MDA than other α‐tocopherol diets. High oil oxidization led to the lowest serum superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GPH‐PX). The serum SOD and GPH‐PX activities in crab fed 100 mg α‐tocopherol were higher than in those fed other α‐tocopherol diets. The diet without α‐tocopherol addition lowered lysozyme and phenoloxidase (PO) activities compared to other α‐tocopherol diets. Fresh fish oil diet increased PO activity compared to oxidized oils. High oil oxidization caused significantly more mortality than fresh or moderate oxidization after 7‐d postchallenge with Aeromonas hydrophila. Supplementation with α‐tocopherol significantly enhanced resistance to bacterial infection. This study indicates that α‐tocopherol can protect lipid from peroxidation and enhance disease resistance.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAeromonas hydrophila 3aEriocheir sinensis 3aalpha-tocopherol 3abacterial infections 3ablood serum 3acrabs 3adiet 3adisease resistance 3aenzyme activity 3afeed conversion 3afish oils 3aglutathione peroxidase 3ahepatopancreas 3ajuveniles 3alysozyme 3amonophenol monooxygenase 3amortality 3aoxidation 3aperoxidation 3asuperoxide dismutase 3aweight gain1 aLi, E.C.1 aQin, J.G.1 aDu, Z.Y.1 aYu, N.1 aKong, Y.Q.1 aFeng, D.X.1 aChen, L.Q.0 tAquaculture nutrition.g2015 Aug., v. 21, no. 4 p.414-424dBlackwell Sciencex1353-57737nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/anu.121713Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02827naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006200148245010500210300001700315520141600332592002801748596005301776650001601829650002601845650002301871650001901894650000901913650002101922650002301943650002301966650001401989650001302003650001602016700002102032700002502053700001802078700002102096700003702117700002102154773012602175856008302301852000902384655001202393IND60764360820221118134530.0220128e202202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076436082DNAL7 a10.1007/s10750-021-04761-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKłosiński, Piotr1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6359-978110aBehavioural responses to con- and heterospecific alarm cues by an alien and a coexisting native fish  ap. 985-1000.  aThe monkey goby Neogobius fluviatilis is an invasive Ponto-Caspian fish that enters habitats of the native gudgeon Gobio gobio in European freshwaters, likely belonging to the same prey guild. Their abilities to detect and avoid predation have been poorly understood, although these traits may contribute to the competitive advantage and drive the invasion success of the goby. We tested intra- and interspecific responses of fish from sympatric populations to damage-released alarm cues (skin extract) in laboratory. Both species of fish responded to conspecific and heterospecific cues, but their responses to conspecifics were more diverse (changed social distancing among individuals, reduced vertical and horizontal movement) than those elicited by heterospecifics (changed social distancing only). Moreover, the fish differed in their anti-predation behaviour: the gudgeon increased whilst the monkey goby decreased inter-individual distances and only the gudgeon exhibited thigmotaxis and reduced mobility in response to the conspecific cues. Interspecific differences show that the species exhibit distant anti-predation strategies. This might be associated with their phylogenetic distance and/or higher differentiation of their ecological niches than commonly assumed. Besides, our results suggest that alien species be included in the interspecific exchange of information in local fish assemblages.  aPublisher supplied data  a2016/23/B/NZ8/00741cNarodowe Centrum Nauki (PL) 3aGobio gobio 3aNeogobius fluviatilis 3acolonizing ability 3aconspecificity 3afish 3agenetic distance 3aindigenous species 3aintroduced species 3apredation 3asympatry 3athigmotaxis1 aKobak, Jarosław1 aAugustyniak, Mateusz1 aPawlak, Roman1 aJermacz, Łukasz1 aPoznańska-Kakareko, Małgorzata1 aKakareko, Tomasz0 tHydrobiologia.g2022 Feb., v. 849, no. 4 p.985-1000dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:jnl42390x0018-81587nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-021-04761-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02559naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002900140245016600169300001800335520120300353592002801556650005301584650001101637650002501648650001301673650002801686650002201714650001701736650001101753650001101764650001601775650002301791650001701814651001801831700002601849700001601875700001801891700002101909773012401930856007402054852000902128655001202137IND60617741620221120233545.0181026e20180221xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061774162DNAL7 a10.1039/c7fo01650f2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBurton-Freeman, Britt M.10aAssessing the consumption of berries and associated factors in the United States using the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), 2007–2012  ap. 1009-1016.  aIntake of berries was assessed relative to other fruit and fruit juices and total fruit intake in the U.S. population age 2 years and older using the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, 2007–2012. Average daily intake of total fruit was about 1 cup, and berries comprised approximately 10% of total fruit consumption. Only 18% of the population met the recommendation of at least 2 cups of fruit per day. Children ages 2 to 5 years consumed the most total fruit of which about half was juice and 4% of which was berries. Among adults, the highest berry consumption was by those who were 65 years and older, non-Hispanic White, and had the highest education and income levels. Use of the Nutrition Facts panel and ingredient labeling was associated with greater total fruit and berry intake. Those who were aware of an amount of fruit that is associated with good health and of dietary guidance in general and those who had fruit available in the home consumed about twice as much berries as others. Fruit intake remains below recommendations in the U.S.; berry intake is particularly low. Behavioral indicators provided insight on how fruit and berry consumption might be increased.  aPublisher supplied data 3aNational Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 3aadults 3aaverage daily intake 3achildren 3adietary recommendations 3afruit consumption 3afruit juices 3afruits 3aincome 3aingredients 3anutrition labeling 3asmall fruits 3aUnited States1 aGuenther, Patricia M.1 aOh, Miyoung1 aStuart, David1 aJensen, Helen H.0 tFood & function.g2018 Feb. 21, v. 9, no. 2 p.1009-1016dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26907x2042-650X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c7fo01650f3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02923naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100003100148245011700179300001100296520122600307592002801533596008301561650001801644650001601662650001101678650001501689650002801704650002701732650002001759650001301779650001401792650001101806650000901817650001301826650002001839650002001859650001601879650002001895650001701915700002901932700003101961700003001992700003802022700002802060700006702088700002702155773013102182856008302313852000902396655001202405IND60764361120221118134250.0220209e202202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076436112DNAL7 a10.1007/s11250-022-03091-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSantos, Flávio Soares dos10aEffect of replacing soybean meal with peanut meal on milk production and fat composition in lactating dairy cows  ap. 80.  aThe objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of replacing soybean meal with peanut meal on milk production, chemical and fatty acid composition, nutritional quality indicators of the lipid fraction, and the economic viability of the diets. Twelve crossbred cows in the initial lactation third, with a bodyweight of 545 ± 37 kg and average milk production of 28 kg/day of milk were distributed in a 4 × 4, triple Latin square design. The treatments consisted of diets with substitution levels of soybean meal for peanut meal (0; 330; 670; and 1000 g/kg in DM). The peanut meal inclusion to replace soybean meal in the diets provided a decreasing linear effect for the protein (P = 0.02) and casein (P = 0.01) concentration in milk. Milk production, total solids concentration, feed efficiency, fatty acid composition, and nutritional quality indicators of the milk lipid fraction were not influenced by the substitution levels. The diet cost per kg DM decreased due to the peanut meal inclusion as a protein source. The partial or total substitution of soybean meal for peanut meal in the feedlot cows diet reduces the cost of feed, without affecting milk production and total solids yield.  aPublisher supplied data  a470828/2013-7cConselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico 3aanimal health 3abody weight 3acasein 3acrossbreds 3aeconomic sustainability 3afatty acid composition 3afeed conversion 3afeedlots 3alactation 3alipids 3amilk 3amilk fat 3amilk production 3anutritive value 3apeanut meal 3aprotein sources 3asoybean meal1 aSignoretti, Ricardo Dias1 aOliveira, Juliana Silva de1 aSilva, Gabriel Teodoro da1 aRufino, Marcelo de Oliveira Alves1 aSouza, Carla Giselly de1 aPinheiro, Jessyca Karen1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4148-53451 aGonzaga Neto, Severino0 tTropical animal health and production.g2022 Feb., v. 54, no. 1 p.80-80dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl706x0049-47477nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11250-022-03091-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01570naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100003100147245009700178300001200275520070600287592002800993650001601021650002201037650001001059650001601069651002101085773009601106856008101202852000901283655001201292IND60439118120221120112447.0161105e200603  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6043911812DNAL7 a10.1007/s10152-005-0008-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLópez-González, Pablo J.12aA new gorgonian genus from deep-sea Antarctic waters (Octocorallia, Alcyonacea, Plexauridae)  ap. 1-6.  aMesogligorgia scotiae gen. nov., sp. nov. is described and illustrated from a colony collected in the Scotia Sea, 2,201–2,213 m in depth, on the ANDEEP-I cruise.

LHCB2.4 is among the genes responsive to light signals, and its expression is regulated by redox-regulated members of G-group bZIP transcription factors. The biochemical interrelations of GBF1-interacting protein 1 (GIP1) and the G-group bZIP transcription factors have been investigated. GIP1, previously shown to enhance DNA-binding activities of maize GBF1 and Arabidopsis GBF3, is a plant specific protein that reduces DNA-binding activity of AtbZIP16, AtbZIP68, and AtGBF1 under non-reducing conditions through direct physical interaction shown by the yeast two-hybrid and pull-down assays. Fluorescence microscopy studies using cyan fluorescent protein (CFP)-fusion protein indicate that GIP1 is exclusively localized in the nucleus. Under non- reducing conditions, GIP1 exhibits predominantly high molecular weight forms, whereas it predominates in low molecular weight monomers under reducing conditions. While reduced GIP1 induced formation of DNA-protein complexes of G-group bZIPs, oxidized GIP1 decreased the amount of those complexes and instead induced its chaperone function suggesting functional switching from redox to chaperone activity. Finally analysis of transgenic plants overexpressing GIP1 revealed that GIP1 is a negative co-regulator in red and blue light mediated hypocotyl elongation. By regulating the repression effect by bZIP16 and the activation effect by bZIP68 and GBF1 on LHCB2.4 expression, GIP1 functions to promote hypocotyl elongation during the early stages of Arabidopsis seedling development.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArabidopsis 3ablue light 3acorn 3afluorescence microscopy 3afluorescent proteins 3agene expression 3agenes 3ahypocotyls 3amolecular weight 3aphotomorphogenesis 3aseedlings 3atranscription factors 3atransgenic plants 3atwo hybrid system techniques0 tProtoplasma.g2015 May, v. 252, no. 3 p.867-883dSpringer-Verlagx0033-183X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00709-014-0726-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02272naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001800139245015200157300001800309520102300327592002801350650002201378650000801400650001701408650002001425650001601445650001501461650001901476650001301495650002201508650001201530700001401542700001701556700001901573700001801592700001801610700001701628773013301645856007501778852000901853655001201862IND60538228020221118091841.0160815e20140212xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053822802DNAL7 a10.1021/ie403643v2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFeng, Yongjun10aHigh Antioxidative Performance of Layered Double Hydroxides/Polypropylene Composite with Intercalation of Low-Molecular-Weight Phenolic Antioxidant  ap. 2287-2292.  aIt is of increasing interest to develop high-performance antioxidants for polypropylene (PP). Here, we have developed an organic–inorganic hybrid antioxidant by direct intercalation of low-molecular-weight hindered phenolic antioxidant (AO) into the interlayer region of layered double hydroxides (LDH), prepared the AO-LDH/PP composites following a simple solvent washing method, and investigated the thermal stability of the AO-LDH/PP composites by an accelerated aging method at 150 °C under air atmosphere. The results show that the one-step synthesis method is available to produce the AO-LDH with a basal spacing of 2.8 nm and that the addition of AO-LDH does not influence the crystallization behavior of PP. Furthermore, the radical-scavenging ability of AO-LDH is similar to that of the AO species. The AO-LDH significantly improves the long-term thermal stability of PP related to the CO₃-LDH. The AO-LDH exhibits excellent antioxidative performance with promising applications in the field of polymers.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaccelerated aging 3aair 3aantioxidants 3acrystallization 3aengineering 3ahydroxides 3apolypropylenes 3asolvents 3athermal stability 3awashing1 aJiang, Yu1 aHuang, Qiang1 aChen, Shangtao1 aZhang, Fengbo1 aTang, Pinggui1 aLi, Dianqing0 tIndustrial & Engineering Chemistry Research.g2014 Feb. 12, v. 53, no. 6 p.2287-2292dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-50457nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fie403643v3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02278naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001700155245011100172520096500283592002801248650001501276650001001291650001101301650001901312650001901331650001501350650001601365653001301381653001701394653000801411653000801419653001501427700001301442700005401455700001501509700001801524700001501542700001901557700001701576700001701593700001901610773009201629856009001721852000901811655001201820IND60775964220221120022738.0220830e202209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077596422DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2022.1345272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Yongbo10aPlasmonic Bi promotes the construction of Z-scheme heterojunction for efficient oxygen molecule activation  aReactive oxygen species (ROS) are essential to photocatalytic degradation of antibiotics in water. In this work, we prepared Ag₃PO₄/Bi@Bi₄Ti₃O₁₂ by simple in-situ reduction method and precipitation method, which improves the ability to capture visible light and increases the activity of photoinduced molecular oxygen activation, resulting in reactive oxygen species (ROS) such as superoxide radicals (•O₂⁻), hydroxyl radicals (•OH), and H₂O₂. The excellent TC degradation efficiency derive from the SPR effect of the metal Bi on the surface enhances the light absorption intensity, and development of a Z-scheme heterojunction between Ag₃PO₄ and Bi₄Ti₃O₁₂ promotes the activation of molecular oxygen. A possible photodegradation mechanism of the as-prepared photocatalyst was proposed. This work provides an insight perspective to the synthesis photocatalysts with molecular oxygen activation for environmental remediation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3alight 3aoxygen 3aphotocatalysis 3aphotocatalysts 3aphotolysis 3aremediation 0aZ-scheme 0aPlasmonic Bi 0aSPR 0aROS 0aAntibiotic1 aZhou, Yi1 aZhang, Jin1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7277-09661 aLi, Jiaxin1 aYao, Tiantian1 aChen, Anna1 aXiang, Minghui1 aLi, Qionghua1 aChen, Zhiyue1 aZhou, Yinghong0 tChemosphere.g2022 Sept., v. 302 p.134527-dElsevier LtdwJournal:1969x0045-65357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2022.1345273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01397naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002700150245008100177300001600258520043200274592002800706650001000734650001400744650001500758650002400773650001100797653001800808653001800826653002000844653002400864773012300888856005101011852000901062655001201071IND50087512120221120101700.0140412e20120701xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5008751212DNAL7 a10.1080/00405000.2011.6035092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZervent Ünal, Belkıs14aThe prediction of seam strength of denim fabrics with mathematical equations  ap. 744-751.  aAn experimental study was carried out to determine the effects of the selected sewing parameters in denim fabric on seam strength, and the results were analyzed statistically and graphically.

As a strategy to maintain a respiratory metabolism, many halophilic archaea are capable of denitrification. Among them are members of the genus Haloferax, which are abundant in saline/hypersaline environments. Three reported haloarchaeal denitrifiers, Haloferax mediterranei, Haloferax denitrificans and Haloferax volcanii, were characterized with respect to their denitrification phenotype. A semi‐automatic incubation system was used to monitor the depletion of electron acceptors and accumulation of gaseous intermediates in batch cultures under a range of conditions. Out of the species tested, only H. mediterranei was able to consistently reduce all available N‐oxyanions to N₂, while the other two released significant amounts of NO and N₂O, which affect tropospheric and stratospheric chemistries respectively. The prevalence and magnitude of hypersaline ecosystems are on the rise due to climate change and anthropogenic activity. Thus, the biology of halophilic denitrifiers is inherently interesting, due to their contribution to the global nitrogen cycle, and potential application in bioremediation. This work is the first detailed physiological study of denitrification in haloarchaea, and as such a seed for our understanding of the drivers of nitrogen turnover in hypersaline systems.  aPublisher supplied data  aACIF 2016/077cGeneralitat Valenciana  aCTM2013‐43147‐RcMinisterio de Economía y Competitividad  a231282cNorges Forskningsråd  a275389cNorges Forskningsråd 3aHaloferax mediterranei 3aHaloferax volcanii 3aanthropogenic activities 3abioremediation 3aclimate change 3adenitrification 3adenitrifying microorganisms 3aecosystems 3aextremophiles 3agases 3ahypersalinity 3ametabolism 3anitric oxide 3anitrogen 3anitrogen cycle 3anitrous oxide 3aoxygen 3aphenotype 3astratosphere 3atemperature 3atroposphere1 aPire, Carmen1 aMartínez‐Espinosa, Rosa María1 aBergaust, Linda0 tEnvironmental microbiology.g2019 Jan., v. 21, no. 1 p.427-436dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3867075x1462-29127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1462-2920.144743Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02408naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100001600166245012400182300001800306520082200324592002801146650001601174650001501190650001901205650001101224650001201235650002001247650001701267650003301284650001201317650002201329650004001351650004801391650002501439650001901464650002501483650003401508650002901542650004401571650002201615650002801637650001301665650003301678700001901711700001901730773008401749856004801833852000901881655001201890IND50064254720221122043545.0130327e201304  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006425472DNAL7 a231923892pmid7 a10.1007/s00425-012-1815-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAhn, Eu-Ree14aThe forkhead-associated domain 2 (FHA2) in Arabidopsis plays a role in plant fertility by regulating stamen development  ap. 1015-1023.  aThe forkhead-associated (FHA) domain is involved in protein–protein interaction by recognizing a phosphothreonine epitope on target proteins. In this study, we investigated in planta functions of the Arabidopsis FHA domain 2. AtFHA2 was mainly localized in the nucleus. Arabidopsis fha2 null mutants grew normally during the vegetative stage, but had severely reduced fertility during reproductive stage. The reduced fertility was mainly caused by defective stamen filament elongation, while female flower parts of the mutants were fertile. Additionally, the mutants had fewer stamens than the wild type and the vegetative organs of the mutants, such as cotyledons and leaves, had increased ploidy. These results suggest that AtFHA2 may play a role in a signaling pathway for the control of plant organ development.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArabidopsis 3acotyledons 3afemale flowers 3aleaves 3amutants 3aplant fertility 3aplant organs 3aprotein-protein interactions 3astamens 3avegetative growth 2aArabidopsisxchemistryxphysiology. 2aArabidopsis Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aCotyledonxchemistry 2aDNA, Bacterial 2aDNA, Plantxanalysis 2aFlowersxgrowth & development 2aMutagenesis, Insertional 2aNuclear Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aPlant Infertility 2aPlant Leavesxchemistry 2aPloidies 2aPollenxgrowth & development1 aCho, Hui-Kyung1 aPai, Hyun-Sook0 tPlanta.g2013 Apr., v. 237, no. 4 p.1015-1023dSpringer-Verlagx0032-09357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00425-012-1815-7  aDNAL 7aarticle02388naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001600139245010300155300001600258520130800274592002801582650002601610650001601636650001801652650001101670650002001681650001001701650002301711650001101734650002501745700001501770700001501785700001701800700001701817773009801834856007301932852000902005655001202014IND60342795120221121054244.0150810e201508  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6034279512DNAL7 a10.1111/anu.121792doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZheng, K.K.14aThe effect of feeding rate on the growth performance of green sturgeon (Acipenser medirostris) fry  ap. 489-495.  aFour one‐week growth trials were conducted on green sturgeon fry to determine the effect of feeding rate on their growth performance at 18 °C when they were fed a salmonid soft moist feeds containing 445–457 g kg⁻¹ of crude protein and 201–207 g kg⁻¹ of lipid.

Whiskey samples were injected directly onto the capillary and preconcentrated using field amplified sample stacking prior to analysis with capillary electrophoresis using ultraviolet detection. It was shown that the phenolic aldehydes vanillin and syringaldehyde increased in concentration with aging, while in whiskies aged in sherry casks, a greater number of phenolic compound types were observed and aging in bourbon casks also resulted in distinctive profiles. It was also shown that single pot still whiskeys contained phenolic compound profiles which were typically rich in phenolic aldehyde concentrations and a diversity of phenolic acids. This is the first time that phenolic acid profiles, which contribute to the beverage flavour, have been characterised for single pot still whiskies.  aPublisher supplied data 3acapillary electrophoresis 3acasks 3aflavor 3amalt 3aphenolic acids 3asherry 3avanillin 3awhisky 3aIreland1 aSmyth, Malcolm R.1 aLunte, Craig E.0 tAnalytical methods.g2017 Feb. 23, v. 9, no. 8 p.1248-1252dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26912x1759-96797nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c6ay03299k3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03087naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100006100149245007100210300001400281520167600295592002801971650001401999650001302013650002602026650003002052650001602082650002602098650001402124650002602138650001302164650001302177653002102190653001702211653003102228653002602259653002502285653001802310700002402328700003302352700002302385773014002408856008402548852000902632655001202641IND60612524420221120142643.0190411e201810  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061252442DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ppees.2018.08.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVogel Ely, Cleusa1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9094-952410aIntegrative taxonomy improves delimitation in Hypericum subspecies  ap. 68-76.  aIntegrative approaches have been very useful to identify diagnostic morphological characters in species delimitation and to understand how abiotic factors influence the geographical distribution of taxa and whether these factors may be driving to specific changes in phenotypic variation patterns. Here we use a South American Hypericum species to discuss the importance of such collaborations for taxonomy. The current classification recognizes four sympatric subspecies within Hypericum rigidum; however, due to the presence of intermediary diagnostic characters, a significant number of specimens cannot be assigned to any of these subspecies. Therefore, since the described subspecies are difficult to differentiate, in this study, we applied ecological and morphometric approaches to evaluate whether the infraspecific classification may be sustained in terms of environmental and morphological variation. Applied statistical analyses make evident the high morphological variation within H. rigidum subspecies and the absence of diagnostic characters that sustain the current infraspecific classification. Multivariate analyses also indicate that the morphologic variation of H. rigidum subspecies does not represent adaptive matching of phenotypes to the environment and, therefore, cannot be explained by phenotypic plasticity nor by ecotypic variation. We also discuss the non-standardization of the subspecies concept in plants. In conclusion, H. rigidum subspecies overlap geographically, ecologically and morphologically and, therefore, we recommend that these phenotypes should not be regarded as subspecies, but as part of one single highly variable species.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHypericum 3aecotypes 3aenvironmental factors 3ageographical distribution 3amorphometry 3amultivariate analysis 3aphenotype 3aphenotypic plasticity 3asympatry 3ataxonomy 0aEcological niche 0aHypericaceae 0aInfraspecific delimitation 0aMultivariate analyses 0aPhenotypic variation 0aSouth America1 aAndrade, Bianca Ott1 aIganci, João Ricardo Vieira1 aBoldrini, Ilsi Iob0 tPerspectives in plant ecology, evolution and systematics.g2018 Oct., v. 34 p.68-76dElsevier GmbHwJournal:J000000130x1433-83197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ppees.2018.08.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02545naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002500140245019600165300001600361520105200377592002801429650002601457650001701483650002001500650002701520650001801547650001301565650004301578650002301621650002601644650001501670650001901685650001601704650002201720650001601742700002701758700002801785700003001813700002201843700002901865773012201894856007402016852000902090655001202099IND60617742120221120233652.0181026e20180124xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061774212DNAL7 a10.1039/c7fo01671a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aViuda-Martos, Manuel10aEvaluation of protective effect of different dietary fibers on polyphenolic profile stability of maqui berry (Aristotelia chilensis (Molina) Stuntz) during in vitro gastrointestinal digestion  ap. 573-584.  aThe aim of this work was to determine the protective effect of different dietary fibers on (i) the recovery and bioaccessibility indexes, and (ii) the stability of polyphenolic compounds (phenolic acids, flavonoids and anthocyanins) of maqui berry powder subjected to in vitro gastrointestinal digestion (GID). The extracts obtained in each phase (oral, gastric and intestinal) of GID were used to analyze the stability of polyphenolic compounds by HPLC, and the bioaccessibility of these compounds was also determined. At the end of the GID process, the mixture of maqui berry with the different fibers increased the bioaccessibility index of the phenolic and flavonoid compounds in all cases. The results obtained suggest that the anthocyanins and phenolic acids and flavonoid compounds present in maqui are stabilized through dietary fiber interactions, which might provide sufficient levels for absorption during gastrointestinal digestion. The gums sodium carboxymethyl cellulose, xanthan gum and guar gum provided the best protective effect.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAristotelia chilensis 3aanthocyanins 3abioavailability 3acarboxymethylcellulose 3adietary fiber 3aguar gum 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3ain vitro digestion 3aintestinal absorption 3aintestines 3aphenolic acids 3apolyphenols 3aprotective effect 3axanthan gum1 aLucas-Gonzalez, Raquel1 aBallester-Costa, Carmen1 aPérez-Álvarez, José A.1 aMuñoz, Loreto A.1 aFernández-López, Juana0 tFood & function.g2018 Jan. 24, v. 9, no. 1 p.573-584dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26907x2042-650X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c7fo01671a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01853naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002200140245010400162300001800266520066300284592002800947650000800975650001700983650002801000650002901028650002401057650001401081650003001095650003001125650001801155700001301173700001501186700001401201700001501215700002701230773012701257856007401384852000901458655001201467IND60638448820221119082947.0190429e20170309xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063844882DNAL7 a10.1039/c6ay03309a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFalcone, Natashya10aDemonstration of a tailorable and PCR-free detection of Enterococcus DNA isolated from soil samples  ap. 1643-1649.  aBacteria detection is crucial for water and environmental monitoring. The challenge in this sector is to have a method specific to a range of pathogens of interest, but not too specific to each strain, so that the method can be used to screen a family of species. In this report we demonstrate a new approach which combines isolation of DNA and label-free detection by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. The new approach is shown to be effective with or without using the PCR. The target DNA, common to all Enterococcus species, has been successfully isolated from soil samples, cut by using restriction enzymes and detected to give a positive response.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aEnterococcus 3adielectric spectroscopy 3aenvironmental monitoring 3amicrobial detection 3apathogens 3apolymerase chain reaction 3arestriction endonucleases 3asoil sampling1 aShe, Zhe1 aChen, Chai1 aDong, Bin1 aYi, Daniel1 aKraatz, Heinz-Bernhard0 tAnalytical methods.g2017 Mar. 9, v. 9, no. 10 p.1643-1649dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26912x1759-96797nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c6ay03309a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03244naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100005400155245011500209520158700324592002801911650001801939650002601957650002301983650002202006650001202028650001902040650001302059650002402072650002002096650002702116650002502143650002102168650002502189650001302214650001102227650000702238650001502245650001502260650001402275650001802289653003502307653003302342653001802375700005402393700001202447700001802459700001902477700001602496773009102512856009002603852000902693655001202702IND60775964520221121225329.0220606e202208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077596452DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2022.1346582doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDong, Ziyi1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5278-586110aBenthic ecological restoration under the combined action of slow-release oxygen material and benthic organisms  aThe oxygen level is key benthic ecosystem health. In this study, a new kind of slow-release oxygen material (SROM) was developed and evaluated in a simulation experiment. The effects of SROM dose and dosing method on the pH and DO, the release of nitrogen and phosphorus, and greenhouse gas emissions were studied. The restoration of typical benthic species (Ceratophyllum represented submerged plants and Cipangopaludina cahayensis represented benthic animals) was also evaluated based on the analysis of catalase and peroxidase activities, survival rate, and biomass. The result shows that dosing SROM on mud surfaces had a better effect than dosing in mud. When dosing SROM on the surface of mud at a suitable dose, the DO of water increased from 0.5 mg/L to higher than 4 mg/L, and the pH was below 9, which would be suitable for the survival of benthos. Dosing SROM could also cause the concentrations of nutrient elements (NH₄⁺-N, TN, TP, and PO₄³⁻) in overlying water and the emission flux of CH₄ and CO₂ to decrease. In addition, the growth of Ceratophyllum and Cipangopaludina cahayensis was accelerated, which benefited the restoration of benthic ecosystems. For microbial community structure, various of bacteria for nitrogen and the phosphorus cycle were found in the sediment (including aerobic denitrifying bacteria). Dosing SROM could increase the Simpson index of the bacterial community, means an increase in bacterial diversity. The results show that the dosing of SROM could be an effective method in the early stage of benthic habitat restoration.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCeratophyllum 3abacterial communities 3abenthic ecosystems 3abenthic organisms 3abiomass 3acarbon dioxide 3acatalase 3acommunity structure 3adenitrification 3aecological restoration 3aenvironmental health 3agreenhouse gases 3ahabitat conservation 3anitrogen 3aoxygen 3apH 3aperoxidase 3aphosphorus 3asediments 3asurvival rate 0aBenthic ecological restoration 0aSlow-release oxygen material 0aLake sediment1 aWang, Ying1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1699-85281 aFu, Jun1 aLiu, Xianjing1 aPei, Yuansheng1 aChen, Zehao0 tChemosphere.g2022 Aug., v. 301 p.134658-dElsevier LtdwJournal:1969x0045-65357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2022.1346583Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03514naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001200140245020400152300001800356520171700374592002802091650001802119650001902137650002702156650001502183650001702198650001602215650001602231650002702247650001402274650001102288650001602299650002302315650001802338650002402356650002202380650001602402650001702418650001602435650001802451650000902469650001402478650002102492650002902513650001502542650004402557650001002601650001002611700001902621700001502640700001502655700001702670700001802687773012402705856007402829852000902903655001202912IND60617742320221121021855.0181026e20180321xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061774232DNAL7 a10.1039/c7fo01680h2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLin, He10aUrinary metabolomic study of the antagonistic effect of P. ginseng in rats with estrogen decline using ultra performance liquid chromatography coupled with quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry  ap. 1444-1453.  aEstrogens are biologically active steroid hormones mainly released from the ovary by ovarian secretion of estrogen into the circulating blood to regulate or function at the distal target. Estrogens play an important role in the central nervous system, cardiovascular system and immune system, especially for post-menopausal women. Panax ginseng Mayer has been reported to relieve women’s menopausal symptoms and affect estrogen activities. However, the mechanism of its estrogen regulation has not yet been clearly investigated. In this work, ovariectomized rats were administered a P. ginseng decoction intragastrically for 8 weeks. Urine samples were analyzed by ultra performance liquid chromatography coupled with quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UPLC-Q-TOF-MS) to identify metabolites. The estrous cycle, body weight, uterine weight index and serum hormone levels were measured. The results showed that P. ginseng significantly prolonged the estrus stage, decreased the body weight and serum luteinizing hormone (LH) levels and increased the uterine weight index and serum estradiol (E₂) levels of ovariectomized rats. A total of twelve potential biomarkers for which levels changed markedly upon treatment have been identified based on metabolomics. A systematic network analysis of their corresponding pathways indicates that the antagonistic effect of P. ginseng on ovariectomized rats occurs mainly through regulating steroid hormone metabolism, fatty acid biosynthesis, the citric acid cycle and tryptophan metabolism. In conclusion, this study validated the antagonistic effect of P. ginseng in rats with estrogen decline and explored the metabolic and biochemical mechanisms involved.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPanax ginseng 3aanimal ovaries 3abiochemical mechanisms 3abiomarkers 3abiosynthesis 3ablood serum 3abody weight 3acentral nervous system 3aestradiol 3aestrus 3afatty acids 3ahormone metabolism 3aimmune system 3aluteinizing hormone 3amass spectrometry 3ametabolites 3ametabolomics 3aovariectomy 3apostmenopause 3arats 3asecretion 3asteroid hormones 3atricarboxylic acid cycle 3atryptophan 3aultra-performance liquid chromatography 3aurine 3awomen1 aLiu, Zhongying1 aPi, Zifeng1 aMen, Lihui1 aChen, Weijia1 aLiu, Zhiqiang0 tFood & function.g2018 Mar. 21, v. 9, no. 3 p.1444-1453dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26907x2042-650X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c7fo01680h3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02719naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002400150245008800174300001600262520115300278592002801431650001501459650000801474650001501482650001601497650001401513650003001527650003301557650002201590650001701612653000901629653000901638653000901647653000901656653000801665653000801673653000801681653000901689653000701698653000801705653000901713653001101722653000701733653000701740653000801747653000801755653000801763653000801771653000801779653000901787653001501796653001801811653001401829653001601843653001301859653001901872773009601891856008501987852000902072655001202081IND60612524720221120142624.0201202e201811  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061252472DNAL7 a10.1016/j.protis.2018.04.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHoef-Emden, Kerstin10aRevision of the Genus Chroomonas HANSGIRG: The Benefits of DNA-containing Specimens  ap. 662-681.  aFor years the genus Chroomonas was defined as being a cryptophyte with rectangular periplast plates, with a gullet and with biliprotein types PC 630 or 645. In phylogenetic trees the genus proved to be paraphyletic. Moreover, cells with hexagonal periplast plates were found in an SEM preparation from material of the type species C. nordstedtii. In this study, material of Hansgirg’s C. nordstedtii was subjected to PCR and to sequencing of two short DNA tags. These tags allowed for an unambiguous identification of the real C. nordstedtii in the phylogeny of the blue-green cryptophytes. The genus Chroomonas corresponds to subclade 1, whereas subclades 3 and 4 do not belong to Chroomonas, if Hemiselmis is maintained. Additional examination by light and scanning electron microscopy and by spectrophotometry demonstrate that subclade 1 comprises only cells with hexagonal periplast plates and PC 630, whereas rectangular periplast plates are found only in subclades 3 and 4. Consequently the genus Chroomonas and its type species, C. nordstedtii, are revised and two novel species, C. debatzensis and C. gentoftensis sp. nov., are described.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChroomonas 3aDNA 3aHemiselmis 3anew species 3aparaphyly 3apolymerase chain reaction 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asequence analysis 3aspectroscopy 0aBGBM 0aCCAC 0aCCAP 0aCCMP 0aCPD 0aDIC 0aIPC 0aITS2 0aLM 0aLSU 0aNIES 0aNORCCA 0aPC 0aPE 0aSAG 0aSEM 0aSPC 0aSSU 0aTEM 0aUTEX 0aChroomonas 0anovel species 0aphylogeny 0aancient DNA 0arevision 0aCryptophyceae.0 tProtist.g2018 Nov., v. 169, no. 5 p.662-681dElsevier GmbHwJournal:12496x1434-46107nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.protis.2018.04.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02220naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002000145245012600165300001400291520107400305592002801379650002101407650001901428650001901447650002101466650002101487650003501508650001301543650001501556650001101571651001101582700001901593700002101612700002101633700002101654773010201675856004801777852000901825655001201834IND4446852820221120043055.0120727e201101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444685282DNAL7 a10.1007/s10531-010-9947-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMobaied, Samira14aThe use of diachronic spatial approaches and predictive modelling to study the vegetation dynamics of a managed heathland  ap. 73-88.  aAccording to the EU Habitats Directive, heathlands are a semi-natural habitat type of community interest. This status aims at conserving these habitats, especially where and when they are threatened by various changes, including natural vegetation succession. We present results of a study of the dynamics of a typical dry heathland plot located in the Fontainebleau massif (France). An exhaustive observation of vegetation changes were made on this area of four hectares between 2000 and 2008, employing a spatial approach. We recorded the expansion of Molinia caerulea (L.) Moench at the expense of Ericaceae. The potential future vegetation of the site was modelled using Markov chains coupled to a GIS programme. This model predicted a gradual change in the floristic composition of heathland in favour of M. caerulea at the expense of Calluna vulgaris (L.) Hull and Erica tetralix L., and the expansion of Pinus sylvestris L. The study demonstrates how spatial methods can contribute to the design of reliable management methods of habitats such as the heathlands.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCalluna vulgaris 3aErica tetralix 3aEuropean Union 3aMolinia caerulea 3aPinus sylvestris 3ageographic information systems 3ahabitats 3aheathlands 3amodels 3aFrance1 aRiera, Bernard1 aLalanne, Arnault1 aBaguette, Michel1 aMachon, Nathalie0 tBiodiversity and conservation.g2011 Jan., v. 20, no. 1 p.73-88dSpringer-Verlagx0960-31157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10531-010-9947-1  aDNAL 7aarticle02479naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001400146245012000160300001300280500001400293520134200307592002801649650002201677650001801699650001501717650002501732650001401757650001801771653001401789653002901803653001601832700001501848700001201863700001601875700001901891773009301910856008102003852000902084655001202093IND60698954120221119121449.0210116e20161128xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069895412DNAL7 a10.3897/zookeys.637.99092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDong, Yan10aComplete mitochondrial genomes of two flat-backed millipedes by next-generation sequencing (Diplopoda, Polydesmida)  ap. 1-20.  aNAL-light  aA lack of mitochondrial genome data from myriapods is hampering progress across genetic, systematic, phylogenetic and evolutionary studies. Here, the complete mitochondrial genomes of two millipedes, Asiomorpha coarctata Saussure, 1860 (Diplopoda: Polydesmida: Paradoxosomatidae) and Xystodesmus sp. (Diplopoda: Polydesmida: Xystodesmidae) were assembled with high coverage using Illumina sequencing data. The mitochondrial genomes of the two newly sequenced species are circular molecules of 15,644 bp and 15,791 bp, within which the typical mitochondrial genome complement of 13 protein-coding genes, 22 tRNAs and two ribosomal RNA genes could be identified. The mitochondrial genome of Asiomorpha coarctata is the first complete sequence in the family Paradoxosomatidae (Diplopoda: Polydesmida) and the gene order of the two flat-backed millipedes is novel among known myriapod mitochondrial genomes. Unique translocations have occurred, including inversion of one half of the two genomes with respect to other millipede genomes. Inversion of the entire side of a genome (trnF-nad5-trnH-nad4-nad4L, trnP, nad1-trnL2-trnL1-rrnL-trnV-rrnS, trnQ, trnC and trnY) could constitute a common event in the order Polydesmida. Last, our phylogenetic analyses recovered the monophyletic Progoneata, subphylum Myriapoda and four internal classes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aParadoxosomatidae 3aXystodesmidae 3agene order 3amitochondrial genome 3amonophyly 3aribosomal RNA 0aMyriapoda 0anext-generation sequence 0aPolydesmida1 aZhu, Lixin1 aBai, Yu1 aOu, Yongyue1 aWang, Changbao0 tZooKeys.g2016 Nov. 28, v. 637 p.1-20dPensoft PublisherswJournal:2141x1313-29707nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3897/zookeys.637.99093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02389naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002800149245007800177506002800255520133100283592002801614506003701642650001201679650002501691650001801716650001001734651001101744700003301755700002801788700002901816700003401845773008001879856008301959852000902042655001202051IND60739819420221207082637.0161026s2016    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073981942DNAL7 a10.1051/bioconf/201607030072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCortes, Borges Martiele10aInnovation based on value co-creation: An alternative for Brazilian wine?  aResource is Open Access  aThe Brazilian wine industry has been facing obstacles such as competition and high tax rates. Innovation is an alternative towards this scenario being it a major factor for any company's survival and growth in the market. Besides this, technological advances and access to information provide consumers with a larger number of choices and knowledge for an informed decision making. Despite differentiation efforts consumers did not obtain satisfaction. Customer interaction provides another way to generate innovation from its involvement in the production process (co-creation of value). The research was held in an awarded winery located in Bento Gonçalves (Brazil) with the objective of understanding how the process of value co-creation between Brazilian award-winning wineries and consumers influences innovation generation. It is an exploratory and qualitative study collected through in-depth interviews with a semi-structured script. The winery identifies beneficial effects in the production process resulting from interactions because it narrows the bond with the consumer creating a better understanding of the consumers as well as develop a more tailored offer regarding value. The innovations generated based on co-creation can be taken as an alternative to imposed barriers in the current Brazilian wine sector.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3amarkets 3aqualitative analysis 3awine industry 3awines 3aBrazil1 aMaia, Souto Jéssica Moreira1 aAthos Ribeiro, da Silva1 aVinícius, Araujo Marcos1 aCallegaro, de Menezes Daniela0 tBIO web of conferences.g2016, v. 7 p.03007-dEDP Sciencesx2117-44587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1051/bioconf/201607030073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02802naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100003600139245013000175300001600305520128400321592002801605650001501633650001701648650001001665650001901675650001901694650001501713650001101728650002801739650000701767650001301774650001401787650001101801650001901812653003901831653001001870653000901880653002301889653001701912653001201929700002701941700003501968700003602003700003002039773015702069856007302226852000902299655001202308IND60655521320221121075855.0190801e20190405xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065552132DNAL7 a10.1638/2018-00832doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDutra, Gustavo Henrique Pereira10aVenous and arterial acid-base analysis of magellanic penguins (spheniscus magellanicus), awake and anesthetized by isoflurane  ap. 262-265.  aThis study aimed to compare the venous acid-base status of healthy awake versus anesthetized Magellanic penguins (Spheniscus magellanicus). Ten nonanesthetized penguins were manually restrained, and a venous blood sample was collected. Six of these penguins were anesthetized by 2% isoflurane and, after an anesthetic stabilization period, both venous and arterial blood samples were simultaneously withdrawn. Using an i-STAT analyzer, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PCO₂), partial pressure of oxygen (PO₂), pH, standard bicarbonate concentration (HCO₃–), total carbon dioxide (ctCO₂), oxygen saturation (SO₂), base excess (BE), Na⁺, and K⁺ levels were measured in venous blood samples of awake (Gₐwₐₖₑ) penguins and in venous (Gᵥₑₙ) and arterial blood (Gₐᵣₜ) samples of anesthetized penguins. There were no significant differences between groups in pH, BE, or Na⁺. Venous carbon dioxide pressure, HCO₃–, and venous ctCO₂ were higher in Gᵥₑₙ than Gₐwₐₖₑ penguins, whereas PCO₂ was higher in Gᵥₑₙ than Gₐᵣₜ penguins. PO₂ and SO₂ were higher in the Gₐᵣₜ group than in the other groups. Both venous and arterial blood samples may be used to evaluate the acid-base profile of Magellanic penguins.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSpheniscus 3abicarbonates 3ablood 3ablood sampling 3acarbon dioxide 3aisoflurane 3aoxygen 3aoxygen partial pressure 3apH 3apenguins 3apotassium 3asodium 3asulfur dioxide 0aAcid-base profileAcid-base profile 0aavian 0abird 0ablood gas analysis 0aelectrolytes 0apenguin1 aAraujo, Giuliano Souza1 aSilva, André Nicolai Elias da1 aNascimento, Cristiane Lassalvia1 aCarregaro, Adriano Bonfim0 tJournal of zoo and wildlife medicine.g2019 Apr. 5, v. 50, no. 1 p.262-265dAmerican Association of Zoo VeterinarianswJournal:jnl43569x1937-28257nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1638/2018-00833Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03547naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002300139245013700162300001500299520195400314592002802268650002302296650001502319650001602334650001202350650001902362650001902381650001402400650002102414650001502435650001502450650001402465650001102479650000702490650000902497650001302506650001302519650002102532650001502553650002002568650001802588653002802606653002802634653001802662653002502680700002202705700002002727700002002747773015602767856007302923852000902996655001203005IND60655521420221121075830.0190801e20190405xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065552142DNAL7 a10.1638/2018-00852doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aArchibald, Kate E.10a2-phenoxyethanol (2-pe) and tricaine methanesulfonate (ms-222) immersion anesthesia of american horseshoe crabs (limulus polyphemus)  ap. 96-106.  aDespite extensive literature examining American horseshoe crab physiology, there are comparatively few publications addressing their medical care. Establishing anesthesia protocols for horseshoe crabs is integral to limiting the potential stress and pain associated with invasive procedures and for advancing euthanasia techniques. The objective of this study was to compare the effects of two immersion anesthetics, tricaine methanesulfonate (MS-222) at 1 g/L (buffered with sodium carbonate) and 2-phenoxyethanol (2-PE) at 2 mL/L, on horseshoe crabs. Twenty horseshoe crabs were assigned to one of two anesthetic treatment groups and individually anesthetized in natural seawater. Water quality, cardiac contractility, and hemolymph gas analytes were measured prior to anesthesia and at 30 min Animals were monitored via heart rate, gilling rate, and sedation score every 5 min until recovered. Transcarapacial ultrasonography was used to obtain heart rate, gilling rate, and percent fractional shortening. Light or surgical anesthesia was produced in 10/10 animals in the 2-PE group and 8/10 animals in the MS-222 group. There was no significant difference in sedation scores, induction time (median 15 min), or recovery time (median 20.5 min). Gilling rate and cardiac contractility decreased during anesthesia, whereas heart rate did not. Hemolymph pH and pO₂ were not different among treatment groups or time points. Baseline pCO₂ was higher than pCO₂ at 30 min for both groups but significantly elevated only in the MS-222 group. This is attributed to increased activity during the handling of awake animals. Invasive blood pressure obtained via cardiac catheterization in two animals was markedly decreased during surgical anesthesia. In conclusion, 2-PE and MS-222 provided effective anesthesia with clinically useful induction and recovery times. 2-PE provided a subjectively more reliable and smoother anesthesia compared to MS-222.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLimulus polyphemus 3aanesthesia 3aanesthetics 3aanimals 3ablood pressure 3acarbon dioxide 3acatheters 3achemical species 3aeuthanasia 3aheart rate 3ahemolymph 3aoxygen 3apH 3apain 3aseawater 3asedation 3asodium carbonate 3asulfonates 3aultrasonography 3awater quality 0aAmerican horseshoe crab 0aAtlantic horseshoe crab 0ahemolymph gas 0aimmersion anesthesia1 aScott, Gregory N.1 aBailey, Kate M.1 aHarms, Craig A.0 tJournal of zoo and wildlife medicine.g2019 Apr. 5, v. 50, no. 1 p.96-106dAmerican Association of Zoo VeterinarianswJournal:jnl43569x1937-28257nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1638/2018-00853Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02444naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001500153245010800168300001600276520114600292592002801438650001101466650001701477650002601494650001301520650001901533650001401552650000701566650002101573650001301594650001601607650001501623700001501638700001601653700001401669700002501683700001501708700001501723700001301738700001401751700001501765700001301780773008501793856008701878852000901965655001201974IND60546610020221122155502.0160903e201412  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054661002DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apgeochem.2014.09.0192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMathur, R.10aTracing low-temperature aqueous metal migration in mineralized watersheds with Cu isotope fractionation  ap. 109-115.  aCopper isotope signatures in waters emanating from mineralized watersheds provide evidence for the source aqueous copper in solution. Low-temperature aqueous oxidation of Cu sulfide minerals produces significant copper isotopic fractionation between solutions and residues. Abiotic experimental data of fractionation (defined as Δliquid–solid ‰=δ65Culiquid−δ65Cusolid) are on the order of 1–3‰ and are unique for copper rich-sulfide minerals. Data presented here from ores and waters within defined boundaries of porphyry copper, massive sulfide, skarn, and epithermal ore deposits mimic abiotic experiments. Thus, the oxidation of sulfide minerals appears to cause the signatures in the waters although significant biological, temperature, and pH variations exist in the fluids. Regardless of the deposit type, water type, concentration of Cu in solution, or location, the data provide a means to trace sources of metals in solutions. This relationship allows for tracking sources and degree of metal migration in low temperature aqueous systems and has direct application to exploration geology and environmental geochemistry.  aPublisher supplied data 3acopper 3ageochemistry 3aisotope fractionation 3aisotopes 3amineralization 3aoxidation 3apH 3asulfide minerals 3asulfides 3atemperature 3awatersheds1 aMunk, L.A.1 aTownley, B.1 aGou, K.Y.1 aGómez Miguélez, N.1 aTitley, S.1 aChen, G.G.1 aSong, S.1 aReich, M.1 aTornos, F.1 aRuiz, J.0 tApplied geochemistry.g2014 Dec., v. 51 p.109-115dElsevier Ltdx0883-29277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apgeochem.2014.09.0193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02569naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001600140245012200156300001800278520125400296592002801550650002201578650002301600650002401623650002001647650001601667650000901683650001601692650001701708650001801725650001201743650001001755650002401765650000901789650002101798650000801819700001601827700001401843700001301857700001501870700001701885773012501902856007502027852000902102655001202111IND60767989520221118130836.0220222e20220221xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076798952DNAL7 a10.1039/d1fo03077a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Kehong12al-Theanine mediates the p38MAPK signaling pathway to alleviate heat-induced oxidative stress and inflammation in mice  ap. 2120-2130.  al-Theanine, an active ingredient in the tea plant (Camellia sinensis) associated with calming, is widely used as a functional ingredient and dietary supplement.

Our l-theanine intervention countered the reduction in growth and feed intake of mice under heat stress and reversed liver and jejunum tissue damage. Moreover, l-theanine countered the increase in inflammatory factors TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-1β and antioxidant enzymes SOD and CAT; it also counteracted GSH-Px inactivation, the upregulation of AST and ALT enzyme activity, and MDA production. The mechanism of action may involve mediation of the P38 signaling pathway, inhibition of MK2 overexpression, and downregulation of p-P65/P65 caused by the overexpression of downstream HSP27. This would inhibit the heat stress-induced imbalance in oxidative stress and inflammatory responses.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCamellia sinensis 3aactive ingredients 3adietary supplements 3aenzyme activity 3afeed intake 3aheat 3aheat stress 3ainflammation 3ainterleukin-6 3ajejunum 3aliver 3amechanism of action 3amice 3aoxidative stress 3atea1 aLiu, Enshuo1 aLin, Ling1 aHu, Yuan1 aYuan, Yong1 aXiao, Wenjun0 tFood & function.g2022 Feb. 21, v. 13, no. 4 p.2120-2130dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26907x2042-650X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d1fo03077a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03891naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004600094040001800140100001700158245017900175300001400354520222700368592002802595650001302623650002402636650001902660650001202679650001502691650001402706650002402720650001102744650001202755650001602767650001202783650003302795650002202828650001402850650002902864650001702893650002902910650002002939650001102959653001602970653001502986653001703001653001703018700001603035700001603051700001503067700002503082700001703107773011103124856009303235852000903328655001203337IND60613139420221122004527.0190318e201812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061313942DNAL7 a10.1016/j.theriogenology.2018.08.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNasiri, A.H.10aEffects of live yeast dietary supplementation on hormonal profile, ovarian follicular dynamics, and reproductive performance in dairy cows exposed to high ambient temperature  ap. 41-46.  aTwo experiments were conducted to investigate the effects of dietary supplementation with live yeast culture on hormonal profile, ovarian follicular dynamics and reproductive performance of lactating dairy cows exposed to high ambient temperature. In Expt. 1, Holstein cows were fed a diet with (n = 6) or without (n = 6) 4 g yeast/h/d from 21 d before expected calving date until 8 weeks postpartum. Concentrations of glucose, insulin, insulin like growth factor-I (IGF-I), estradiol-17β (E−17β) and progesterone (P4) were determined in plasma, and transrectal ultrasonography was used to monitor ovarian follicular dynamics. In Expt. 2, 150 Holstein cows (75/dietary group) received same diets as Expt. 1 with the exception that diets were fed from d 1 to d 70 postpartum. The effect of dietary treatments on reproductive performance was examined. In Expt. 1, plasma IGF concentrations during dietary treatment were higher (P = 0.05) in cows fed diets supplemented with yeast. On d 60 postpartum, average plasma concentrations of glucose (48.3 vs. 41.0 mg/dL) and insulin (0.90 vs. 0.23 μU/mL), were also greater in cows fed diets supplemented with yeast compared to that in cow fed diets without supplementation. Similarly, plasma concentrations of E−17β at estrus (P = 0.016) and P4 on d 10 of the estrous cycle (P = 0.021) were greater in yeast-supplemented cows. Moreover, yeast supplementation resulted on average in an estrous cycle 2.6 d shorter (P = 0.05) and in the development of larger ovulatory follicles (18.4 vs. 17.2 mm in diameter; P < 0.01). In Expt. 2, days open were fewer and the proportion of pregnant cows at 120 and 150 d postpartum were greater (P < 0.01) in cows fed diets supplemented with yeast compared to those receiving diets without yeast. In summary, cows fed diets supplemented with yeast had greater plasma IGF-I, E−17β and P4 concentrations, larger ovulatory follicles, shorter estrous cycles, and improved reproductive performance. Therefore, live yeast dietary supplementation could enhance lactating dairy cow's fertility during heat stress through improvement in hormonal profile and development of larger ovulatory follicles.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHolstein 3aambient temperature 3aanimal ovaries 3acalving 3adairy cows 3adays open 3adietary supplements 3aestrus 3aglucose 3aheat stress 3ainsulin 3ainsulin-like growth factor I 3alactating females 3alactation 3anutritional intervention 3aprogesterone 3areproductive performance 3aultrasonography 3ayeasts 0aHeat stress 0aProbiotics 0aReproduction 0aDairy cattle1 aTowhidi, A.1 aShakeri, M.1 aZhandi, M.1 aDehghan-Banadaky, M.1 aColazo, M.G.0 tTheriogenology.g2018 Dec., v. 122 p.41-46dElsevier Inc.aElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl5209x0093-691X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.theriogenology.2018.08.0133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02352naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245009600170300001600266520099000282592002801272650001201300650001901312650001101331650001301342650002001355650002001375650002201395650002901417650002201446650001301468650001801481650000901499653001301508653001901521653002201540653002101562653001601583653002401599653001101623653000801634653000801642653000801650653000901658773009701667856008501764852000901849655001201858IND60546827820221118035728.0160903e20140415xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054682782DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2014.01.0762doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVenmans, Frank10aTriggers and barriers to energy efficiency measures in the ceramic, cement and lime sectors  ap. 133-142.  aEvaluating and understanding the interplay of barriers to the diffusion of energy efficiency measures is highly relevant because, if policies are effective in overcoming these barriers, CO2 emissions can be decreased at low cost. The study aims to understand how managers make decisions to invest in energy efficiency, how perceived barriers affect these decisions and how policy can overcome these barriers. We apply neo-classical economic theory as well as insights from transaction cost economics and behavioural economics to understand why hurdle rates, even when omitted costs and risk are taken into account, are higher than the weighted average cost of capital. We find that internal capital budgeting rules and the effort of studying technical feasibility and profitability are relevant to understanding the efficiency gap. The results indicate that the voluntary agreement and the emission trading scheme are complementary, addressing different barriers in different contexts.  aPublisher supplied data 3acapital 3acarbon dioxide 3acement 3aceramics 3adecision making 3aeconomic theory 3aenergy efficiency 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3aissues and policy 3amanagers 3aprofitability 3arisk 0aBarriers 0aEfficiency gap 0aEnergy efficiency 0aEmission trading 0aHurdle rate 0aVoluntary agreement 0aEU ETS 0aIRR 0aMNC 0aNPV 0aWACC0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2014 Apr. 15, v. 69 p.133-142dElsevier Ltdx0959-65267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2014.01.0763Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02838naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002400147245007700171300001600248520172900264592002801993650001802021650001202039650001202051650002902063650002702092650001202119650001802131650002602149650002602175650000902201650001102210650001002221650001602231700002302247700002102270773009202291856004802383852000902431655001202440IND50073483220221120060059.0140228e201403  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007348322DNAL7 a10.1007/s12155-013-9355-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHeadlee, William L.10aBiochar as a Substitute for Vermiculite in Potting Mix for Hybrid Poplar  ap. 120-131.  aThe purpose of this study was to evaluate biochar as a substitute for vermiculite in potting mixes for unrooted vegetative cuttings of hybrid poplar as represented by the clone ‘NM6’ (Populus nigra L. × Populus suaveolens Fischer subsp. maximowiczii A. Henry). We compared three treatments (peat moss (control), peat moss mixed with vermiculite, and peat moss mixed with biochar) at three times (pre-experiment, pre-fertilizer, and post-fertilizer). The biochar and vermiculite mixes had significantly higher cation exchange capacity (CEC) and pre-experiment exchangeable K than the control. Trees grown in the biochar and vermiculite mixes had significantly higher shoot K than the control at pre-fertilizer and post-fertilizer and significantly higher shoot and total biomass at post-fertilizer. The biochar mix was also associated with lower root biomass and higher shoot/root biomass ratio than the vermiculite mix at post-fertilizer. Vector analysis indicated that all treatments were deficient in N at pre-fertilizer, and the control was also deficient in K at pre-fertilizer and post-fertilizer. Linear regression confirmed that shoot biomass was strongly correlated (R² = 0.97) with N and K uptake (in addition to initial cutting diameter), also, root biomass was strongly correlated (R² = 0.96) with potting mix CEC (in addition to shoot biomass). Luxury consumption of K at pre-fertilizer indicates that the increases in shoot and total biomass observed with the biochar and vermiculite treatments arise from this nutrient being “pre-loaded” in both mixes. We conclude that biochar provides benefits equivalent to vermiculite in terms of key nutrient availability and total biomass productivity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPopulus nigra 3abiochar 3abiomass 3acation exchange capacity 3aexchangeable potassium 3ahybrids 3alinear models 3amosses and liverworts 3anutrient availability 3apeat 3ashoots 3atrees 3avermiculite1 aBrewer, Catherine,1 aHall, Richard B.0 tBioEnergy research.g2014 Mar., v. 7, no. 1 p.120-131dSpringer-Verlagx1939-12347nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12155-013-9355-y  aDNAL 7aarticle02376naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131100001900149245008400168300001600252500001500268520131900283592002801602650001101630650002101641650001501662650000901677650001101686650001201697650002201709653001801731700002901749700002201778700002201800773009801822856008501920852000902005655001202014IND4457659520221118123411.0141110e20110525xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445765952DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhydrol.2011.03.0282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNester, Thomas10aClimate and catchment controls on the performance of regional flood simulations  ap. 340-356.  a2019-12-06  aFlood runoff is simulated for 57 catchments in Austria and Southern Germany. Catchment sizes range from 70 to 25,600km², elevations from 200 to 3800m and mean annual precipitation from 700 to 2000mm. A semi-distributed conceptual water balance model on an hourly time step is used to examine how model performance (both calibration and validation) is related to the hydroclimatic characteristics of the catchments. Model performance of runoff is measured in terms of four indices, the Nash–Sutcliffe model efficiency, the volume error, the percent absolute peak errors and the error in the timing of the peaks. The simulation results indicate that the model performance in terms of the Nash–Sutcliffe model efficiency has a tendency to increase with mean annual precipitation, mean annual runoff, the long-term ratio of rainfall and total precipitation and catchment size. Peak errors have a tendency to decrease with climatological variables as well as with catchment size. Catchment size is the most important control on the model performance but also the ratio rain/precipitation is an important factor. The hydrograph shapes tend to improve with the spatial scale and magnitude of the precipitation events. Calibration and validation results are consistent in terms of these controls on model performance.  aPublisher supplied data 3afloods 3amodel validation 3awatersheds 3arain 3arunoff 3aclimate 3ahydrologic models 0awater balance1 aKirnbauer, R.q(Robert),1 aGutknecht, Dieter1 aBlöschl, Günter0 tJournal of hydrology.g2011 May 25, v. 402, no. 3-4 p.340-356dElsevier B.V.x0022-16947nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2011.03.0283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02371naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001300140245017700153300001800330520120300348592002801551650002701579650001401606650001401620650001701634650001601651650001701667650002901684650002101713700001601734700001601750700001701766700001701783773012501800856007501925852000902000655001202009IND60767989720221118130833.0220222e20220221xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076798972DNAL7 a10.1039/d1fo03191k2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Yi10aS-20, a steroidal saponin from the berries of black nightshade, exerts anti-multidrug resistance activity in K562/ADR cells through autophagic cell death and ERK activation  ap. 2200-2215.  aMultidrug resistance (MDR) is a major cause of chemotherapy failure. Adriamycin (ADR) has been widely used to treat cancer, however, as a substrate of the adenosine triphosphate binding cassette (ABC) transporter, it is easy to develop drug resistance during the treatment. Here, we demonstrated that steroidal saponin S-20 isolated from the berries of black nightshade has comparable cytotoxicity in ADR-sensitive and resistant K562 cell lines. Autophagy is generally considered to be a protective mechanism to mediate MDR during treatment. However, we found that S-20-induced cell death in K562/ADR is associated with autophagy. We further explored the underlying mechanisms and found that S-20 induces caspase-dependent apoptosis in ADR-sensitive and resistant K562 cell lines. Most importantly, S-20-induced autophagy activates the ERK pathway and then inhibits the expression of drug resistance protein, which is the main reason to overcome K562/ADR resistance, rather than apoptosis. Taken together, our findings emphasize that S-20 exerts anti-multidrug resistance activity in K562/ADR cells through autophagic cell death and ERK activation, which may be considered as an effective strategy.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadenosine triphosphate 3aapoptosis 3aautophagy 3acytotoxicity 3adoxorubicin 3adrug therapy 3amultiple drug resistance 3asteroid saponins1 aXu, Jingwen1 aWang, Yihai1 aXiang, Limin1 aHe, Xiangjiu0 tFood & function.g2022 Feb. 21, v. 13, no. 4 p.2200-2215dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26907x2042-650X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d1fo03191k3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03552naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002800151245010200179300001400281520186500295592002802160650001802188650001602206650002002222650001402242650001802256650001402274650002502288650001902313650001002332650001502342650001602357650001202373650001902385650001602404650002602420650002002446650002602466650001802492650001202510650001302522650001602535650002502551650002102576651001302597653002602610653002902636653002002665653002502685653001802710700002402728700002102752773009502773856008502868852000902953655001202962IND60546828020221118035648.0160903e20140415xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054682802DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2014.01.0782doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBojacá, Carlos Ricardo10aLife cycle assessment of Colombian greenhouse tomato production based on farmer-level survey data  ap. 26-33.  aIn Colombia, greenhouse tomato production systems are thought to cause considerable environmental impact. In this study, we employ life cycle assessment to assess the environmental impact of tomato production in a key growing area, the Alto Ricaurte province. A regional farmer survey (n = 117) was the primary data source, while secondary data for background processes were based on Ecoinvent v. 2.0 and LCAFoods databases. An uncertainty analysis for the primary data source was carried out considering the high variability in local management practices. All resources consumption and emissions were allocated to a functional unit of one ton of tomatoes, restricting the boundaries of the system from raw material extraction up to the farm gate. We applied the CML2001 v.2.05 impact assessment method including 10 midpoint categories. The production system consisted of six stages: nursery, infrastructure, machinery, fertilization, pest management and waste management. At the inventory level, results exhibited a high dispersion indicating the wide range of products and doses applied by growers, especially for the fertilization and pest management stages. Overall, the infrastructure stage had the largest burden for most impact categories. The fertilization stage was the second highest burden for abiotic depletion, acidification and eutrophication potentials. The waste management stage was the main contributor to the overall impact for freshwater and marine aquatic ecotoxicity potentials. The impacts for each stage were largely determined by the production of agricultural inputs. Uncertainty analysis showed positive skewed distributions, with a few growers extending the tail towards the highest environmental impact side. The main stages contributing to the uncertainty on the outcome were the fertilization, pest management and waste stages.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacidification 3aagriculture 3acrop production 3adatabases 3aecotoxicology 3aemissions 3aenvironmental impact 3aeutrophication 3afarms 3afreshwater 3agreenhouses 3agrowers 3ainfrastructure 3ainventories 3alife cycle assessment 3apest management 3aproduction technology 3araw materials 3asurveys 3atomatoes 3auncertainty 3auncertainty analysis 3awaste management 3aColombia 0aProtected cultivation 0aEnvironmental assessment 0aFarming systems 0aUncertainty analysis 0aFarmer survey1 aWyckhuys, Kris A.G.1 aSchrevens, Eddie0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2014 Apr. 15, v. 69 p.26-33dElsevier Ltdx0959-65267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2014.01.0783Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01188naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100001600138245010500154300001800259520015900277592002800436650001500464650002300479650001700502650001500519650002100534650000900555700001600564700002500580700001600605700001800621773012900639856007300768852000900841655001200850IND60657781820221116234330.0190816e20060320xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065778182DNAL7 a10.1039/b516782e2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLo, Chen-Fu10aEvidence for the assembly of carboxyphenylethynyl zinc porphyrins on nanocrystalline TiO₂ surfaces  ap. 1430-1432.  aUV-visible absorption and AFM studies suggest that carboxyphenylethynyl zinc porphyrins aggregate on nanocrystalline TiO₂ surfaces in an H-type fashion.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3achemical reactions 3ananocrystals 3aporphyrins 3atitanium dioxide 3azinc1 aLuo, Liyang1 aDiau, Eric Wei-Guang1 aChang, I-Jy1 aLin, Jingyao,0 tChemical communications.g2006 Mar. 20, , no. 13 p.1430-1432dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26910x1364-548X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1039/b516782e3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02459naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092040001800130100002200148245008900170300001400259520117300273592002801446650001301474650001201487650001801499650001301517650002501530650002801555650001801583650001501601650002301616650001701639650001201656650001701668650001101685650001901696650001101715650001801726650001001744650002801754650001901782773011901801856008401920852000902004655001202013IND4487738220221117232956.0141110e201103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND448773822DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cosust.2010.12.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSÃ©guin, Armand10aHow could forest trees play an important role as feedstock for bioenergy production?  ap. 90-94.  aIn the context of finding alternative sources to liquid fossil fuels and their replacement with renewable and sustainable alternatives, the use of lignocellulosic biomass from trees has attracted increased interest. Plantation forest biomass represents a renewable resource that has been well integrated into various industrial processes. It mainly serves as feedstock for the lumber and pulp and paper industries. Lignin removal is an important technical issue for paper manufacturing and is the key challenge for the conversion of lignocellulosic feedstock into liquid transportation fuels such as ethanol. This paper reviews recent advances in plantation forestry research relevant to sustainable bioenergy production. The economic viability of tree biomass for biofuel production requires improved processing technologies to meet this challenge. In parallel, recent research advances are improving plantation trees for bioenergy and bioindustry adapted woody feedstock production through improved breeding, biotechnology and establishment of tree plantations. These purpose-grown trees also offer potential for carbon sequestration and natural forest preservation.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiofuels 3abiomass 3abiotechnology 3abreeding 3acarbon sequestration 3aeconomic sustainability 3aethanol fuels 3afeedstocks 3aforest plantations 3aforest trees 3aforests 3afossil fuels 3alignin 3alignocellulose 3alumber 3amanufacturing 3apaper 3apulp and paper industry 3atransportation0 tCurrent opinion in environmental sustainability.g2011 Mar., v. 3, no. 1-2 p.90-94dElsevier B.V.x1877-34357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cosust.2010.12.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03383naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100002300166245010400189300001800293520141300311592002801724650002001752650001601772650001501788650001401803650001901817650002001836650002601856650001101882650003301893650001801926650001401944650001401958650001301972650001201985650007301997650002202070650003602092650006602128650002102194650001202215650003302227650007502260650004902335650001002384650002402394700002102418700001902439700002302458700002002481700002302501700002202524773011002546856008102656990002302737852000902760655001202769IND60090722520221121044728.0141102e20120715xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009072252DNAL7 a226829222pmid7 a10.1016/j.bmc.2012.05.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHerth, Matthias M.10aSynthesis and evaluation of [¹¹C]Cimbi-806 as a potential PET ligand for 5-HT₇ receptor imaging  ap. 4574-4581.  a2-(2′,6′-Dimethoxy-[1,1′-biphenyl]-3-yl)-N,N-dimethylethanamine has been identified as a potent ligand for the serotonin 7 (5-HT₇) receptor. In this study, we describe the synthesis, radiolabeling and in vivo evaluation of [¹¹C]2-(2′,6′-dimethoxy-[1,1′-biphenyl]-3-yl)-N,N-dimethylethanamine ([¹¹C]Cimbi-806) as a radioligand for imaging brain 5-HT₇ receptors with positron emission tomography (PET). Precursor and reference compound was synthesized and subsequent ¹¹C-labelling with [¹¹C]methyltriflate produced [¹¹C]Cimbi-806 in specific activities ranging from 50 to 300GBq/μmol. Following intravenous injection, brain uptake and distribution of [¹¹C]Cimbi-806 was assessed with PET in Danish Landrace pigs. The time–activity curves revealed high brain uptake in thalamic and striatal regions (SUV ∼2.5) and kinetic modeling resulted in distribution volumes (VT) ranging from 6mL/cm³ in the cerebellum to 12mL/cm³ in the thalamus. Pretreatment with the 5-HT₇ receptor antagonist SB-269970 did not result in any significant changes in [¹¹C]Cimbi-806 binding in any of the analyzed regions. Despite the high brain uptake and relevant distribution pattern, the absence of appropriate in vivo blocking with a 5-HT₇ receptor selective compounds renders the conclusion that [¹¹C]Cimbi-806 is not an appropriate PET radioligand for imaging the 5-HT₇ receptor in vivo.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDanish Landrace 3aantagonists 3acerebellum 3achemistry 3aimage analysis 3ain vivo studies 3aintravenous injection 3amodels 3apositron-emission tomography 3aradiolabeling 3areceptors 3aserotonin 3athalamus 2aAnimals 2aBiphenyl Compoundsxchemical synthesisxchemistryxpharmacokinetics. 2aBrainxmetabolism 2aCarbon Radioisotopesxchemistry 2aEthylaminesxchemical synthesisxchemistryxpharmacokinetics. 2aIsotope Labeling 2aLigands 2aPositron-Emission Tomography 2aRadiopharmaceuticalsxchemical synthesisxchemistryxpharmacokinetics. 2aReceptors, Serotoninxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aSwine 2aTissue Distribution1 aHansen, Hanne D.1 aEttrup, Anders1 aDyssegaard, Agnete1 aLehel, Szabolcs1 aKristensen, Jesper1 aKnudsen, Gitte M.0 tBioorganic & medicinal chemistry.g2012 July 15, v. 20, no. 14 p.4574-4581dElsevier Ltdx0968-08967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bmc.2012.05.0053Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02629naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002200151245017100173300001600344520128900360592002801649650001401677650001301691650001101704650001501715650001401730650002601744650001901770651001501789653001501804653001501819653003001834653001501864700002401879700002101903700002101924700002001945700001601965700001501981773010401996856008602100852000902186655001202195IND60587048620221122210551.0190408e201801  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058704862DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecoleng.2017.11.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMetzger, Marco E.10aMinimizing mosquito larval habitat within roadside stormwater treatment best management practices in southern California through incremental improvements to structure  ap. 185-191.  aA five-year study was conducted in Orange County, California to document the presence of standing water and the presence or absence of larval mosquitoes within 23 stormwater treatment Best Management Practices (BMPs) installed along State Route 73 by the California Department of Transportation. Findings were used to guide incremental improvements to BMP design and function with the aim of reducing the occurrence of standing water that persisted more than 96h after precipitation. During the first year of monitoring, a number of structural and non-structural factors were identified as causes for standing water within BMPs suitable for mosquitoes. Uneven grades, inlet design and construction, and novel structural features were most frequently responsible for standing water, often exacerbated by sediment and debris accumulations and periodic or perennial non-stormwater flows. Subsequent modifications to BMPs eliminated or reduced the size of persistent standing water pools. The study demonstrated that mosquito larval habitat can be mitigated in BMPs designed to remain dry between precipitation events by collecting field data that identifies where post-construction structural and managerial changes are needed to eliminate or reduce unintended sources of standing water.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCulicidae 3ahabitats 3alarvae 3amonitoring 3asediments 3astormwater management 3atransportation 3aCalifornia 0aMosquitoes 0aStormwater 0aBest Management Practices 0aCalifornia1 aHarbison, Justin E.1 aBurns, Joseph E.1 aKramer, Vicki L.1 aNewton, John H.1 aDrews, John1 aHu, Renjie0 tEcological engineering.g2018 Jan., v. 110 p.185-191dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11630x0925-85747nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoleng.2017.11.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02223naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002400147245009600171300001800267520117900285592002801464650002201492650001201514650002101526650001301547650002601560650001201586650001201598700003101610700001901641700002701660773010801687856008101795852000901876655001201885IND60121436920221120035852.0150407e201504  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012143692DNAL7 a10.1007/s10641-014-0349-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBarriga, Juan Pablo10aPhoto-identification and the effects of tagging on the Patagonian catfish Hatcheria macraei  ap. 1163-1171.  aEffects of subcutaneous visible implanted alphanumeric (VIA) microtags, pelvic fin excision, and individual photo-identification (Pid) based on natural spot patterns were experimentally evaluated in the small stream benthic Patagonian catfish Hatcheria macraei. VIA tag retention was 90 % during the first 45 days, decreasing to 80 % at day 200, and 66 % at the end of the experiment, at day 254. Fin regeneration was not evident during the experiment. Survival, growth rate or condition factor (Fulton’s K) did not differ between tagged or pelvic fin clipped catfish and a control group. Spot patterns varied greatly among individuals and remained constant throughout the experimental period, thereby making identification of individual Pid possible in H. macraei. Tagging was not effective in identifying individual fish due to mark loss or difficulty in reading VIA tag codes. The combination of Pid with VIA tagging or fin clipping techniques in longterm experiments is advisable in order to facilitate individual recognition. The Pid analysis described in this study is a low-cost method that could potentially be applied to any fish with a variable spot pattern.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHatcheria macraei 3acatfish 3acondition factor 3aexcision 3along term experiments 3areading 3astreams1 aChiarello-Sosa, Juan Mauro1 aJuncos, Romina1 aBattini, Miguel Ángel0 tEnvironmental biology of fishes.g2015 Apr., v. 98, no. 4 p.1163-1171dSpringer-Verlagx0378-19097nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10641-014-0349-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02399naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001900153245009400172300001600266500001500282520108200297592002801379650002001407650001101427650001701438650001801455650001501473650001701488650002301505650002001528650001701548651001501565653001201580653002501592653001301617653002201630653001501652653001201667700001501679700001501694700001701709773011801726856008801844852000901932655001201941IND60525042420221119195623.0190318e20160715xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052504242DNAL7 a10.1016/j.marpolbul.2016.04.0482doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChubarenko, I.10aOn some physical and dynamical properties of microplastic particles in marine environment  ap. 105-112.  a2019-12-06  aSimplified physical models and geometrical considerations reveal general physical and dynamical properties of microplastic particles (0.5–5mm) of different density, shape and size in marine environment. Windage of extremely light foamed particles, surface area and fouling rate of slightly positively buoyant microplastic spheres, films and fibres and settling velocities of negatively buoyant particles are analysed. For the Baltic Sea dimensions and under the considered idealised external conditions, (i) only one day is required for a foamed polystyrene particle to cross the sea (ca. 250km); (ii) polyethylene fibres should spend about 6–8months in the euphotic zone before sinking due to bio-fouling, whilst spherical particles can be retained on the surface up to 10–15years; (iii) for heavy microplastic particles, the time of settling through the water column in the central Gotland basin (ca. 250m) is less than 18h. Proper physical setting of the problem of microplastics transport and developing of physically-based parameterisations are seen as applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3awater pollution 3abasins 3apolystyrenes 3aeuphotic zone 3abiofouling 3asurface area 3amarine environment 3aphysical models 3apolyethylene 3aBaltic Sea 0aWindage 0aMarine microplastics 0aplastics 0aSettling velocity 0aBiofouling 0aDensity1 aBagaev, A.1 aZobkov, M.1 aEsiukova, E.0 tMarine pollution bulletin.g2016 July 15, v. 108, no. 1-2 p.105-112dElsevier LtdwJournal:12420x0025-326X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.marpolbul.2016.04.0483Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02533naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100001800184245012600202300002000328506007600348520111200424592002801536506003701564650001601601650001201617650002001629650002301649650001401672650001401686650001901700650001401719700001701733700002001750700002101770700001901791700003201810773017701842856008302019852000902102655001202111IND4487034620221207103644.0120502e20110927xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND448703462DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.11137261082doi7 aPMC31827042pmcid7 a219113702pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBonardi, Vera10aExpanded functions for a family of plant intracellular immune receptors beyond specific recognition of pathogen effectors  ap. 16463-16468.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aPlants and animals deploy intracellular immune receptors that perceive specific pathogen effector proteins and microbial products delivered into the host cell. We demonstrate that the ADR1 family of Arabidopsis nucleotide-binding leucine-rich repeat (NB-LRR) receptors regulates accumulation of the defense hormone salicylic acid during three different types of immune response: (i) ADRs are required as "helper NB-LRRs" to transduce signals downstream of specific NB-LRR receptor activation during effector-triggered immunity; (ii) ADRs are required for basal defense against virulent pathogens; and (iii) ADRs regulate microbial-associated molecular pattern-dependent salicylic acid accumulation induced by infection with a disarmed pathogen. Remarkably, these functions do not require an intact P-loop motif for at least one ADR1 family member. Our results suggest that some NB-LRR proteins can serve additional functions beyond canonical, P-loopâdependent activation by specific virulence effectors, extending analogies between intracellular innate immune receptor function from plants and animals.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aArabidopsis 3aanimals 3aimmune response 3amicrobial proteins 3apathogens 3areceptors 3asalicylic acid 3avirulence1 aTang, Saijun1 aStallmann, Anna1 aRoberts, Melinda1 aCherkis, Karen1 aDangl, J.

The soil meso and macrofauna were studied in two periods, namely 1995–1997 (initial period) and 20 years later in 2015–16 (follow-up period). We sampled transplanted blocks (Transported), overburden at a 2-m distance from the blocks (Adjacent), and overburden at a 30-m distance from the blocks (Control). The number of mites was highest in the Transported, in the initial period, and at the Control 20 years after- i.e. in the follow-up period. Judging by their higher densities, for Lumbricidae, and most of the miscellaneous macrofauna, Transported was favored in both time periods. The high macroarthropod densities in the Transported position, even after 20 years, and the low microarthropod densities in the Adjacent position together suggest a limited role of transplanted soil blocks in the colonization of the spoil overburden, signifying that soil development of the spoil overburden might be even more critical than the migration barrier.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLumbricidae 3acoal 3along term effects 3ameadows 3amining 3amites 3asoil blocks 3asoil fauna 3atopsoil 0aPost-mining sites 0aFaunal colonization 0aSoil inoculation 0aMesofauna 0aMacrofauna1 aVicentini, Fabio1 aŠimáčková, Hana1 aPižl, Václav1 aTajovský, Karel1 aStary, Josef1 aFrouz, Jan0 tEcological engineering.g2018 Jan., v. 110 p.158-164dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11630x0925-85747nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoleng.2017.11.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02571naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001700153245014000170300001600310520102800326592002801354650001601382650003101398650001701429650002001446650001101466650001101477650002001488650001901508651001901527653001201546653003301558653001901591653002101610653002601631700001901657700001601676700001901692700001601711700001901727700001701746700001901763700001901782700006101801773011801862856008801980852000902068655001202077IND60525042520221119195608.0190318e20160715xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052504252DNAL7 a10.1016/j.marpolbul.2016.04.0492doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKim, Moonkoo10aOrigins of suspended particulate matter based on sterol distribution in low salinity water mass observed in the offshore East China Sea  ap. 281-288.  aThe molecular composition and distribution of sterols were investigated in the East China Sea to identify the origins of suspended particulate matter (SPM) in offshore waters influenced by Changjiang River Diluted Water (CRDW). Total sterol concentrations ranged from 3200 to 31,900pgL−1 and 663 to 5690pgL−1 in the particulate and dissolved phases, respectively. Marine sterols dominated representing 71% and 66% in the particulate and dissolved phases, respectively. Typical sewage markers, such as coprostanol, were usually absent at ~250km offshore. However, sterols from allochthonous terrestrial plants were still detected at these sites. A negative relationship was observed between salinity and concentrations of terrestrial sterols in SPM, suggesting that significant amounts of terrestrial particulate matter traveled long distance offshore in the East China Sea, and the Changjiang River Diluted Water (CRDW) was an effective carrier of land-derived particulate organic matter to the offshore East China Sea.  aPublisher supplied data 3acoprostanol 3aparticulate organic matter 3aparticulates 3aplants (botany) 3arivers 3asewage 3awater pollution 3awater salinity 3aEast China Sea 0aSterols 0aSuspended particulate matter 0aEast China Sea 0aLipid biomarkers 0aRiver plume ecosystem1 aJung, Jee-hyun1 aJin, Yongnu1 aHan, Gi Myeong1 aLee, Taehee1 aHong, Sang Hee1 aYim, Un Hyuk1 aShim, Won Joon1 aChoi, Dong-Lim1 aKannan, Narayanan1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4334-29380 tMarine pollution bulletin.g2016 July 15, v. 108, no. 1-2 p.281-288dElsevier LtdwJournal:12420x0025-326X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.marpolbul.2016.04.0493Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02702naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003600113040001800149100002000167245012200187300001600309520109900325592002801424650001801452650001501470650001401485650002501499650002601524650002401550650001201574650001301586650001001599650000901609650006201618650003101680650001101711650000901722650001601731650002501747650002301772650005501795650002001850653001301870653002001883653001401903653001601917700001801933773014101951856008302092852000902175655001202184IND50070529820221121172639.0190412e201311  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007052982DNAL7 a237357182pmid7 a10.1016/j.jneb.2013.01.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBell, Claire F.10aDeterminants of Nutrition Appointment Attendance Among Male Veterans Attending Veterans Health Administration Clinics  ap. 739-744.  aTo identify determinants of nutrition appointment attendance among male veterans attending outpatient Veterans Health Administration clinics.Sequential use of qualitative and quantitative methods. Individual, semi-structured interviews and a mail survey were used to identify factors associated with outpatient nutrition appointment attendance.Qualitative analysis of 17 interviews revealed 6 themes reflecting rationales for missed appointments: travel difficulty, forgetting the appointment, competing demands, scheduling difficulty, knowledge not new or useful, and lack of provider support. Analysis of 349 returned surveys indicated past attendance history, health status, and participation in the referral and scheduling process correlated to appointment attendance (P < .05). Regression analysis substantiated the importance of social support (P < .05).Veterans Health Administration patients should participate in the referral and scheduling process.

Pigeons in each group were immunised against paramyxovirosis at week 6 and 9 of life. Water for injection (group A - control) or methisoprinol at 100 mg/kg of body weight (group B), 200 mg/kg of body weight (group C) and 600 mg/kg of body weight (group D) was administered intramuscularly for 3 days before each vaccination. The immunological analyses were carried out by flow cytometry and the ELISA test.The findings indicate that methisoprinol administered intramuscularly at 100 and 200 mg/kg of body weight for 3 successive days before vaccination against paramyxovirosis mainly stimulates the mechanisms of non-specific humoral and cellular immunity, which is indicated by a higher percentage of the subpopulation of CD4⁺ T lymphocytes in peripheral blood and in the spleen and a higher titre of anti-NDV antibodies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCD4-positive T-lymphocytes 3aCD8-positive T-lymphocytes 3aantibodies 3ablood serum 3abody weight 3acell-mediated immunity 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3aflow cytometry 3ahealth status 3aimmunosuppression 3apigeons 3aspleen 3avaccination 0apigeons 0amethisoprinol 0aimmunomodulation 0aT lymphocytes 0aanti-NDV antibodies1 aTykałowski, B.1 aŚmiałek, M.1 aKwiatkowska-Stenzel, A.1 aKoncicki, A.0 tPolish journal of veterinary sciences.g2011 Oct. 24, v. 14, no. 3 p.367-371dVersitax1505-17737nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2478/v10181-011-0055-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03832naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001700094024002100111024003000132040001800162100001700180245009900197300001600296506017300312520207100485650001002556650005002566650001302616650001302629650002702642650001902669650002502688650001202713650001602725650003002741650001702771650000902788650002002797650001602817650000902833650001202842650001102854650001802865650002002883700001802903773010102921856011203022856007603134956008603210961000903296852000903305655001203314IND60006131320221214223508.0150826s2014    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6000613132DNAL7 a2854362aris7 a10113/613132hdl7 a10.13031/aea.30.99372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aALLRED, B.

Filter treatment systems can potentially remove pesticides from water. Therefore, a laboratory investigation was initiated to assess the water treatment capabilities of four iron-based filter materials to remove three different organochloride pesticides. The iron-based filter materials evaluated were zero valent iron (ZVI), porous iron composite (PIC), sulfur modified iron (SMI), and iron oxide/hydroxide (IOH). The three organochloride pesticides tested on the iron-based filter materials were 2,4-D, alachlor, and atrazine. The laboratory investigation included contaminant removal batch tests and low-to-high flow rate saturated solute transport column tests. Results of replicated contaminant removal batch tests indicate, that of the four iron-based filter materials evaluated, PIC is clearly the most effective for water treatment of 2,4-D, alachlor, and atrazine. The initial batch test concentration for each of the three pesticides was 500 ppb, and the replicated PIC batch tests averaged more than 98% removal for alachlor and greater than 99% removal of 2,4-D and atrazine. Pesticide water treatment capabilities for PIC were further assessed by comparing results between control (no filter material - empty column) and PIC saturated solute transport column tests. In contrast to an influent concentration entering the PIC column of 500 ppb for each of the three pesticides, effluent 2,4-D, alachlor, and atrazine concentrations exiting the PIC column were less than 0.3 ppb, even when the column retention time was only 4 minutes. Importantly, all PIC column test effluent pesticide concentrations were well below USEPA drinking water standards. Consequently, this preliminary laboratory assessment indicates that the PIC filter material exhibits promise for organochloride pesticide water treatment; however, more laboratory and field testing is needed to fully determine PIC capabilities. 3a2,4-D 3aUnited States Environmental Protection Agency 3aalachlor 3aatrazine 3achemical concentration 3adrinking water 3aenvironmental health 3afilters 3agroundwater 3agroundwater contamination 3ahuman health 3airon 3airon hydroxides 3airon oxides 3arisk 3asolutes 3asulfur 3asurface water 3awater treatment1 aRACHARAKS, R.0 tApplied engineering in agriculture.g2014, v. 30, no. 6 p.859-867wJournal:2058x0883-85427nnas40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/613133Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.13031/aea.30.99373Available from publisher's site  aARIS submissionbhttp://submit-u.nal.usda.gov/system/files/submissions/285436.pdf  aUSDA  aDNAL 7aarticle02757naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100006700153245014800220300001600368520127700384592002801661650001201689650002001701650001201721650001201733650001101745650001201756650001401768650003001782650001601812650002001828651001401848653001001862653001001872653002801882653002001910653001401930700005501944700002101999700001502020700001902035700001902054773011702073856008802190852000902278655001202287IND60525042820221119195439.0190318e20160930xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052504282DNAL7 a10.1016/j.marpolbul.2016.04.0522doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCahyarini, Sri Yudawati1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8378-071610aCoral Sr/Ca-based sea surface temperature and air temperature variability from the inshore and offshore corals in the Seribu Islands, Indonesia  ap. 694-700.  aThe ability of massive Porites corals to faithfully record temperature is assessed. Porites corals from Kepulauan Seribu were sampled from one inshore and one offshore site and analyzed for their Sr/Ca variation. The results show that Sr/Ca of the offshore coral tracked SST, while Sr/Ca variation of the inshore coral tracked ambient air temperature. In particular, the inshore SST variation is related to air temperature anomalies of the urban center of Jakarta. The latter we relate to air—sea interactions modifying inshore SST associated with the land-sea breeze mechanism and/or monsoonal circulation. The correlation pattern of monthly coral Sr/Ca with the Niño3.4 index and SEIO-SST reveals that corals in the Seribu islands region respond differently to remote forcing. An opposite response is observed for inshore and offshore corals in response to El Niño onset, yet similar to El Niño mature phase (December to February). SEIO SSTs co-vary strongly with SST and air temperature variability across the Seribu island reef complex. The results of this study clearly indicate that locations of coral proxy record in Indonesia need to be chosen carefully in order to identify the seasonal climate response to local and remote climate and anthropogenic forcing.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEl Nino 3aair temperature 3acalcium 3aclimate 3acorals 3aislands 3astrontium 3asurface water temperature 3aurban areas 3awater pollution 3aIndonesia 0aCoral 0aSr/Ca 0aSea surface temperature 0aAir temperature 0aIndonesia1 aZinke, Jens1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0634-82811 aTroelstra, Simon1 aSuharsono,1 aAldrian, Edvin1 aHoeksema, B.W.0 tMarine pollution bulletin.g2016 Sept. 30, v. 110, no. 2 p.694-700dElsevier LtdwJournal:12420x0025-326X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.marpolbul.2016.04.0523Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02506naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245007400166300001800240500001100258500001900269520125100288592002801539596012801567650002601695650001901721650001701740650002001757650001601777650001301793650002201806650001301828650001401841700006101855773012401916856008302040852000902123655001202132IND60671617520221119002744.0220122e201910  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067161752DNAL7 a10.1007/s11033-019-04958-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPanda, Munmun10aCell signaling and cancer: a mechanistic insight into drug resistance  ap. 5645-5659.  aReview  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aDrug resistance is a major setback for advanced therapeutics in multiple cancers. The increasing prevalence of this resistance is a growing concern and bitter headache for the researchers since a decade. Hence, it is essential to revalidate the existing strategies available for cancer treatment and to look after a novel therapeutic approach for target based killing of cancer cells at the genetic level. This review outlines the different mechanisms enabling resistance including drug efflux, drug target alternation, alternative splicing, the release of the extracellular vesicle, tumor heterogeneity, epithelial-mesenchymal transition, tumor microenvironment, the secondary mutation in the receptor, epigenetic alternation, heterodimerization of receptors, amplification of target and amplification of components rather than the target. Furthermore, existing evidence and the role of various signaling pathways like EGFR, Ras, PI3K/Akt, Wnt, Notch, TGF-β, Integrin-ECM signaling in drug resistance are explained. Lastly, the prevention of this resistance by a contemporary therapeutic strategy, i.e., a combination of specific signaling pathway inhibitors and the cocktail of a cancer drug is summarized showing the new treatment strategies.  aPublisher supplied data  aECR/2016/000792cDepartment of Science and technology, Science and Engineering Research Board (DST, SERB), New Delhi, India 3aantineoplastic agents 3acancer therapy 3adimerization 3adrug resistance 3aepigenetics 3aheadache 3amolecular biology 3amutation 3aneoplasms1 aBiswal, Bijesh K.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5609-76600 tMolecular biology reports.g2019 Oct., v. 46, no. 5 p.5645-5659dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl5510x0301-48517nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11033-019-04958-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02642naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245011500163300001600278520145500294592002801749650001701777650001001794650001901804650001301823650001201836650001101848650001601859650001101875650002201886650001301908653001101921653001201932653001301944653001101957653002201968653001301990700002002003773010702023856008102130852000902211655001202220IND60520550620221120124723.0160521e20111024xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052055062DNAL7 a10.2478/v10181-011-0056-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKowalik, S.14aThe effect of interval versus continuous exercise on plasma leptin and ghrelin concentration in young trotters  ap. 373-378.  aThe effect of interval vs. continuous exercise on plasma leptin and ghrelin concentration in young Standardbred horses was studied. The experiment was conducted on 27 trotters, in the age between 2 and 3 years. They were divided into two groups according to the type of exercise. Blood samples were collected through jugular venipuncture in the following experimental conditions: at rest, immediately after exercise and 30 minutes after the end of the effort. Plasma leptin and ghrelin concentrations were determined using RIA tests. The continuous exercise induced an increase in plasma leptin concentration whereas the interval type of exercise did not influence the level of this hormone (3.47 ± 0.78 vs. 4.07 ± 0.94 and 2.31 ± 0.15 vs. 2.36 ± 0.21 ng/mL, respectively). The plasma ghrelin concentration measured after the continuous exercise, significantly increased (720 ± 27.4 vs. 814 ± 13.8; p ≤ 0.05) whereas concentration of this hormone assessed after the interval exercise, significantly dropped (982 ± 56.5 vs. 842 ± 35.6 pg/mL; p ≤ 0.05). The changes in plasma ghrelin concentration measured after the end of the effort correlated inversely with blood lactic acid concentration. In conclusion, the obtained results showed that medium-intensive type of exercise, such as trot, interval or continuous, slightly affected plasma leptin level but significantly affected plasma ghrelin concentration in young Standardbred trotters.  aPublisher supplied data 3aStandardbred 3ablood 3ablood sampling 3aexercise 3aghrelin 3ahorses 3alactic acid 3aleptin 3aradioimmunoassays 3atrotting 0aleptin 0aghrelin 0ahormones 0ahorses 0aenergy metabolism 0aexercise1 aKędzierski, W.0 tPolish journal of veterinary sciences.g2011 Oct. 24, v. 14, no. 3 p.373-378dVersitax1505-17737nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2478/v10181-011-0056-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03999naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100007100140245011900211300001800330520223600348592002802584650000802612650001102620650001602631650001402647650002302661650001902684650001302703650002002716650002002736650001002756650002302766650001402789650002502803650001502828650003002843650001202873650002202885650004302907650000902950650005202959650001403011650001303025650002603038650001703064650003803081700002003119700002003139700001403159700001703173700002003190773012803210856007403338852000903412655001203421IND60617381720221120204312.0181025e20180529xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061738172DNAL7 a10.1039/c8bm00317c2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJiangThese authors are contributed equally to this work., Xianfang14aThe role of Sox9 in collagen hydrogel-mediated chondrogenic differentiation of adult mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs)  ap. 1556-1568.  aSox9 is a transcription factor that regulates chondrogenesis, but its role in the chondrogenic differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) triggered by materials is poorly understood. In this study, we investigated the effect of Sox9 interference on collagen-induced chondrogenesis and further collagen-based therapies for cartilage defects. In this paper, MSCs were infected with a vector carrying the Sox9 promoter and related markers were detected. A lentivirus-mediated vector targeting the silencing of the Sox9 gene was used in bone marrow-derived MSCs prior to being encapsulated in a collagen hydrogel. The collagen hydrogel as a sole inducer was also compared with transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1). Before being implanted into the articular cartilage defect in rats, the cell–hydrogel pellets were cultured in vitro for 14 days. The effect of Sox9 transfection on cell proliferation was evaluated by measuring the total DNA content. Safranin-O staining and a biochemistry assay were performed to assess the synthesis and secretion of glycosaminoglycan (GAG) of MSCs. The real-time fluorescent quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was performed to detect the gene expression levels of Col1a1, Col2a1, Acan and Sox9. The protein expression of collagen type II and collagen type I was analyzed by immunohistochemical analysis. Collagen alone significantly increased the luciferase activity of the Sox9 promoter, which was in parallel with the upregulation of cartilage specific markers. In vitro, the chondrogenic differentiation ability of MSCs was greatly inhibited after Sox9 interference, both in the collagen and TGF-β1-induced groups. In vivo, a further study showed that cartilage regeneration was arrested by using transfected MSCs with an injectable collagen gel or induced by TGF-β1. The results indicated that collagen may mediate Sox9 expression by providing a biomimetic microenvironment favoring cell condensation prior to chondrogenesis. The role of Sox9 regulation by materials is similar to that by growth factors, suggesting that well-designed scaffolds may replace growth factors in chondrogenesis. Thus, interventions targeting Sox9 may help improve articular cartilage repair.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aadults 3abiomimetics 3acartilage 3acell proliferation 3achondrogenesis 3acollagen 3aenzyme activity 3agene expression 3agenes 3aglycosaminoglycans 3ahydrogels 3aimmunohistochemistry 3aluciferase 3amesenchymal stromal cells 3apellets 3aprotein synthesis 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3arats 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3asecretion 3astaining 3atranscription factors 3atransfection 3atransforming growth factor beta 11 aHuang, Xianyuan1 aJiang, Tongmeng1 aZheng, Li1 aZhao, Jinmin1 aZhang, Xingdong0 tBiomaterials science.g2018 May 29, v. 6, no. 6 p.1556-1568dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26911x2047-48497nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c8bm00317c3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02564naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245015900171300001400330520108000344592002801424650001101452650002101463650001201484650001901496650001201515650001801527650002801545650002101573650001001594650002301604650001001627650000901637650001701646650002701663650002101690650001601711653001501727653001101742653001301753653002501766653000801791700002201799700006101821773009301882856008601975852000902061655001202070IND60623705520221120033525.0190403e201902  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062370552DNAL7 a10.1016/j.meatsci.2018.09.0142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNeedham, Tersia10aInfluence of extending the pre-slaughter interval after second vaccination on the carcass cutting yield and the quality of meat from immunocastrated lambs  ap. 13-18.  aThe influence of extending the vaccination-to-slaughter interval of immunocastrated lambs on carcass cutting yield and meat quality of the Longissimus thoracis (LT) muscle was investigated in forty Dohne Merino lambs (8.5 months old; 53.7 ± 4.8 kg). Immunocastration booster vaccination intervals of six (IC6; n = 10) and four (IC4; n = 10) weeks prior to the slaughter age were used, with two weeks between primary and secondary vaccinations. A further 10 lambs were Burdizzo-castrated at 6.5 months old (B). The control treatment remained intact (R; n = 10). Prime cutting yields, LT muscle area, LT subcutaneous fat thickness and instrumental meat quality were accessed. Both castration methods increased LT fat thickness and decreased meat CIE a* (redness) values. Extending the vaccination-to-slaughter interval of immunocastrates increased the gastrointestinal tract fat and decreased meat redness. Immunocastration of male lambs can thus be used to manipulate backfat without negatively influencing carcass weight, cutting yield or meat quality.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMerino 3aage at slaughter 3abackfat 3acarcass weight 3acutting 3afat thickness 3agastrointestinal system 3aimmunocastration 3alambs 3alongissimus muscle 3amales 3ameat 3ameat quality 3asecondary immunization 3asubcutaneous fat 3avaccination 0aCastration 0aColour 0aImprovac 0aLongissimus thoracis 0aRam1 aLambrechts, Helet1 aHoffman, Louwrens1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2736-19330 tMeat science.g2019 Feb., v. 148 p.13-18dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl8541x0309-17407nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.meatsci.2018.09.0143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01628naa a2200277 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002100145245005100166300001400217520084100231592002801072650001201100650001401112650001301126650001701139650001201156651001001168773010301178856004801281852000901329655001201338IND4486095520221118002347.0120727e200902  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND448609552DNAL7 a10.1007/s10311-007-0131-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTanner, Peter A.10aVehicle-related ammonia emissions in Hong Kong  ap. 37-40.  aWeekly passive sampling of ambient ammonia has been performed at ground or rooftop levels at 12 locations in Hong Kong representing different land use categories.

However, it is now generally accepted that the gut microbiota plays an important role in drug metabolism prior to drug absorption or during enterohepatic circulation via various microbial enzymatic reactions in the intestine. Moreover, some drugs are metabolized by gut microbiota to specific metabolite(s) that cannot be formed in the liver. More importantly, the metabolism of drugs by gut microbiota prior to absorption can alter the systemic bioavailability of certain drugs. Therefore, understanding drug metabolism by gut microbiota is critical for explaining changes in the pharmacokinetics of drugs, which may cause significant alterations in drug-induced pharmacodynamics and toxicities. In this review, we describe recent progress with regard to the role of metabolism by gut microbiota in some drug-induced alterations of either pharmacological or toxicological effects to emphasize the clinical importance of gut microbiota for safe and effective use of drugs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3abioavailability 3adrugs 3aenzymatic reactions 3aintestinal microorganisms 3aintestinal mucosa 3aliver 3ametabolites 3apharmacodynamics 3apharmacokinetics1 aKang, You Ra1 aNepal, Mahesh Raj1 aShakya, Rajina1 aKang, Mi Jeong1 aKang, Wonku1 aLee, Sangkyu1 aJeong, Hye Gwang1 aJeong, Tae Cheon0 tArchives of pharmacal research.g2017 Dec., v. 40, no. 12 p.1345-1355dPharmaceutical Society of Koreax0253-62697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12272-017-0986-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02725naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100003400140245011400174300001800288520120200306592002801508650001501536650001201551650001501563650002401578650001101602650000901613650001901622650002001641650000901661650003101670650001401701650001901715650003101734650001401765650002301779650002401802650001701826650001401843700001701857700001701874700001401891700001701905700001701922700001601939700001501955700001301970773012901983856007402112852000902186655001202195IND60617381920221122032723.0181025e20180625xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061738192DNAL7 a10.1039/c8bm00336j2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiEqual contribution., Erdong10aFabrication of PEGylated Fe@Bi₂S₃ nanocomposites for dual-mode imaging and synergistic thermoradiotherapy  ap. 1892-1898.  aNanocomposites for integrating imaging and therapy have attracted tremendous attention for biomedical applications. Herein, Fe@Bi₂S₃ nanocomposites modified with polyethylene glycol (PEG) molecules are fabricated for synergistic thermoradiotherapy. For such nanocomposites, Bi₂S₃ exhibits a strong absorbance in the near-infrared (NIR) region, which allows Bi₂S₃ to convert energy from light into heat for effective photothermal therapy (PTT), whereas Bi can also significantly enhance radio-mediated cell death induction as a radiotherapy sensitizer due to its high atomic number (high-Z). Most importantly, it is found that the combination of PTT and radiation therapy (RT), using PEGylated Fe@Bi₂S₃ nanocomposites, can bring a strong synergistic effect for the tumor treatment in in vitro and in vivo experiments. Besides, the magnetic Fe core and the Bi₂S₃ shell components endow this nanocomposite with an ability to serve as both a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (CT) contrast agent. Therefore, our work presents a new type of multifunctional nanocomposite with the potential for synergistic thermoradiotherapy and simultaneously MRI/CT imaging.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorbance 3abismuth 3acell death 3acomputed tomography 3aenergy 3aheat 3aimage analysis 3ain vivo studies 3airon 3amagnetic resonance imaging 3amagnetism 3ananocomposites 3anear-infrared spectroscopy 3aneoplasms 3aphotothermotherapy 3apolyethylene glycol 3aradiotherapy 3asynergism1 aCheng, Xiaju1 aDeng, Yaoyao1 aZhu, Jing1 aXu, Xiaoding1 aSaw, Phei Er1 aGu, Hongwei1 aGe, Cuicui1 aPan, Yue0 tBiomaterials science.g2018 June 25, v. 6, no. 7 p.1892-1898dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26911x2047-48497nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c8bm00336j3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02514naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100003000151245016400181300001400345520108800359592002801447650001701475650002301492650001801515650002301533650001101556650001301567650001701580650001201597650001301609650001501622650001101637650001901648653001701667653001201684653001601696653002201712653001901734653001601753700007101769700002801840773009301868856008601961852000902047655001202056IND60623705620221120033610.0210105e201903  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062370562DNAL7 a10.1016/j.meatsci.2018.11.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPolizer Rocha, Yana Jorge10aUnderstanding the consumer's perception of traditional frankfurters and frankfurters with healthy attributes through sorting task and hard laddering techniques  ap. 70-78.  aThis study evaluated the consumer's perception towards traditional frankfurters and frankfurters with healthy attributes through sorting task and hard laddering techniques. Images with descriptions of various frankfurter types (traditional, with natural antioxidants, reduced sodium, reduced fat, as a source of dietary fibre, with omega 3, no phosphate added, no nitrite added) were presented as stimuli to 164 previously recruited consumers. The lack of information, natural, flavour issues and not being appealing characterised the no phosphate and no nitrite frankfurter groups. The consequences mentioned by the consumers that justified the choice of frankfurters with reduced sodium and fat were to avoid high blood pressure, concern about the prevention of diseases, negative perception of sodium and fat in the diet and help in weight control. It can be concluded that consumers are willing to substitute a product in traditional frankfurter with a healthier option. Among the more promising prospects for the market, are the frankfurters with reduced sodium and reduced fat.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantioxidants 3aconsumer attitudes 3adietary fiber 3adisease prevention 3aflavor 3ahot dogs 3ahypertension 3amarkets 3anitrites 3aphosphates 3asodium 3aweight control 0aMeat product 0aNitrite 0aHealthiness 0aSensory technique 0aSodium content 0aFat content1 ade Noronha, Regina Lucia F.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0422-57201 aTrindade, Marco Antonio0 tMeat science.g2019 Mar., v. 149 p.70-78dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl8541x0309-17407nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.meatsci.2018.11.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03387naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002100148245014400169300001800313520186100331592002802192596008802220650001402308650002102322650001002343650002102353650001602374650001402390650001402404650003002418650001302448650002002461650002102481650000902502650002202511650001202533650001502545650001902560700002402579700002202603700002402625700002102649700001902670773012402689856008302813852000902896655001202905IND60671617920221119002729.0220122e201910  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067161792DNAL7 a10.1007/s11033-019-04949-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRahmati, Hamideh10aProbiotic supplementation attenuates hippocampus injury and spatial learning and memory impairments in a cerebral hypoperfusion mouse model  ap. 4985-4995.  aProbiotics are referred to species of living microscopic organisms may help conserve the normal balance of the digestive system and/or manage diseases. A number of autoimmune, psychiatric, cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disorders may be associated with the imbalance of gut microbiota. This study examines the effect of 21 days consumption of multistrain probiotics on hippocampus injury, spatial and learning memory and some potential molecular mechanisms in a mouse model with cerebral hypoperfusion. Cerebral hypoperfusion was established in the mouse model by bilateral common carotid artery occlusion (BCCAO) for 20 min and 24 h reperfusion. Mixtures of several probiotic bacteria at concentrations of 10⁷, 10⁸ and 10⁹ CFU/day were orally administrated for 3 weeks before the BCCAO. Spatial and learning memory, histological damage and apoptosis were assessed in the CA1, CA3 and dentate gyrus (DG) of the hippocampus 24 h after ischemia. The malondialdehyde (MDA) content and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) level were measured by ELISA technique. Prophylactic of probiotic considerably reduced the number of apoptotic cells and neuronal death in the CA1, CA3 and DG of the hippocampus at all three concentrations (P < 0.001). In addition, probiotics reduced spatial memory impairment and neurological dysfunction only at the 10⁹-CFU/day (P < 0.01). Nonetheless, probiotics did not change the levels of BDNF and MDA in the hippocampus (P > 0.05). According to the findings, the daily prophylactic ingestion of probiotics reduced hippocampus damage and prevented the spatial learning and memory deficit by suppressing apoptosis in the mouse model with cerebral hypoperfusion. Probiotic supplementation may be suggested as a useful preventive dietary strategy for groups susceptible to cerebrovascular diseases.  aPublisher supplied data  a1306cVice Chancellor for Research Centers of Semnan University of Medical Sciences 3aapoptosis 3acarotid arteries 3adeath 3adigestive system 3ahippocampus 3ahistology 3aingestion 3aintestinal microorganisms 3aischemia 3amalondialdehyde 3amemory disorders 3amice 3amolecular biology 3aneurons 3aprobiotics 3aspatial memory1 aMomenabadi, Shahein1 aVafaei, Abbas Ali1 aBandegi, Ahmad Reza1 aMazaheri, Zohreh1 aVakili, Abedin0 tMolecular biology reports.g2019 Oct., v. 46, no. 5 p.4985-4995dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl5510x0301-48517nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11033-019-04949-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02120naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002200153245008300175300001600258520127800274592002801552650001701580650001101597651001301608700002001621700002001641773008501661856008701746852000901833655001201842IND60546611320221122090405.0160903e201412  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054661132DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apgeochem.2014.10.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEllefsen, Karl J.12aA modified procedure for mixture-model clustering of regional geochemical data  ap. 315-326.  aA modified procedure is proposed for mixture-model clustering of regional-scale geochemical data. The key modification is the robust principal component transformation of the isometric log-ratio transforms of the element concentrations. This principal component transformation and the associated dimension reduction are applied before the data are clustered. The principal advantage of this modification is that it significantly improves the stability of the clustering. The principal disadvantage is that it requires subjective selection of the number of clusters and the number of principal components. To evaluate the efficacy of this modified procedure, it is applied to soil geochemical data that comprise 959 samples from the state of Colorado (USA) for which the concentrations of 44 elements are measured. The distributions of element concentrations that are derived from the mixture model and from the field samples are similar, indicating that the mixture model is a suitable representation of the transformed geochemical data. Each cluster and the associated distributions of the element concentrations are related to specific geologic and anthropogenic features. In this way, mixture model clustering facilitates interpretation of the regional geochemical data.  aPublisher supplied data 3ageochemistry 3amodels 3aColorado1 aSmith, David B.1 aHorton, John D.0 tApplied geochemistry.g2014 Dec., v. 51 p.315-326dElsevier Ltdx0883-29277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apgeochem.2014.10.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02430naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001600140245010600156300001800262520107200280592002801352650001201380650001601392650001201408650001801420650002301438650001401461650002001475650000901495650001501504650001901519650002301538650001101561650001901572650001401591650001301605700001901618700001601637700001601653700001601669700001901685700001801704700001701722773012501739856007501864852000901939655001201948IND60767990520221120074633.0220222e20220221xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076799052DNAL7 a10.1039/d1fo03389a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYu, Man-Man10aEffects of antioxidants of bamboo leaves on protein digestion and transport of cooked abalone muscles  ap. 1785-1796.  aThe effects of oxidation on protein digestion and transport in cooked abalone muscles were investigated using a combination of simulated digestion and everted-rat-gut-sac models for the first time. Boiling heat treatments caused protein oxidation in the abalone muscles, reflected by increases in the carbonyl group and disulfide bond contents, protein hydrophobicity and aggregation degree, as well as decreases in the free sulfhydryl group and amino acid contents. Protein oxidation significantly inhibited the degree of hydrolysis, digestion rate, and digestibility of the abalone muscles in the simulated digestion model. The results from the everted-rat-gut-sac model showed that amino acid and peptide transport levels from the digestion products of the cooked abalone muscles were lower than those of the uncooked samples. In contrast, the addition of antioxidants of bamboo leaves mitigated heat-treatment-induced protein oxidation, aggregation and increased hydrophobicity, and consequently improved abalone muscle protein digestibility and transport levels.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabalone 3aamino acids 3abamboos 3adigestibility 3adigestible protein 3adigestion 3adisulfide bonds 3aheat 3ahydrolysis 3ahydrophobicity 3ain vitro digestion 3amodels 3amuscle protein 3aoxidation 3apeptides1 aFan, Ying-Chen1 aLiu, Yu-Xin1 aYin, Fa-Wen1 aLi, De-Yang1 aLiu, Xiao-Yang1 aZhou, Da-Yong1 aZhu, Bei-Wei0 tFood & function.g2022 Feb. 21, v. 13, no. 4 p.1785-1796dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26907x2042-650X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d1fo03389a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01824naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245006300165300001600228520081900244592002801063650002201091650001001113650001701123650001201140650001001152653002201162653000801184653001001192653001301202700001701215700001401232700001901246773010701265856008101372852000901453655001201462IND60520551120221120120755.0160521e20111024xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052055112DNAL7 a10.2478/v10181-011-0061-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKosiński, A.10aMyocardial bridges in domestic pig - morphological aspects  ap. 411-416.  aThe morphology of myocardial bridges (MB) in the heart of the domestic pig remain an open issue.

In the examined group of 150 domestic pig's hearts, the length of the detected MB varied from 1.8 to 39.7 mm while their thickness amounted to 0.8 - 4.7 mm. Both the longest and the thickest bridges were connected with the posterior interventricular branch. It was noticed that the MB muscle bands cross the long axis of the vessels located in the grooves mostly at almost a right angle.

Due to a short projected term of availability of the copper, zinc and lead resources (20–30 years) and unavoidable consumption of primary energy (oil, coal, natural gas) the problem of efficiency and economics of the currently used and future technologies is important. It is important that the metallurgy industry is efficient because it can be a significant contribution to Gross National Product and energy consumption in countries where metal production occurs. For example, to get the maximum value from copper deposits, the proper and most efficient technology (of many) should be chosen. The authors proposed a minimum value of Cumulative Exergy Consumption (CExC) as the criterion for the recommended technology. Based on this criterion we conclude that, for example, pure copper cathode production by flash smelting technology is the best technology.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaluminum 3acoal 3acopper 3aelectrodes 3aexergy 3agross national product 3alead 3ametallurgy 3anatural gas 3aoils 3aprimary energy 3azinc 0aExergy 0aCumulative exergy consumption 0aThermo-ecological cost 0aEntropy generation rate1 aHołda, Adam1 aKolenda, Zygmunt0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2014 Dec. 01, v. 84 p.313-321dElsevier Ltdx0959-65267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2014.01.0933Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02648naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100003000151245009300181300001400274520102600288592002801314650001001342650001001352650000901362650002501371650001101396650001901407650001101426650001201437650002101449650002401470650001501494650002001509650001101529650001401540650001501554650002401569650001501593650004001608653001601648653002201664653001601686653001201702700002601714700002301740700002801763700002701791700005601818700003201874773009301906856008601999852000902085655001202094IND60623705920221120033401.0190403e201902  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062370592DNAL7 a10.1016/j.meatsci.2018.08.0162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMalheiros, Jessica Moraes10aInfluence of oxidative damage to proteins on meat tenderness using a proteomics approach  ap. 64-71.  aThe objective of this study was to evaluate the association between oxidative damage to proteins (represented by protein carbonylation) and beef tenderness.

Decrease in oxidative damage of the metabolic enzymes (TPI1, GAPDH and ENO3) were observed in tender meat group (P < .05). The present results suggest that oxidation act on the proteins of different metabolic pathways and consequently affect meat tenderness in Angus crossbred cattle.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAngus 3aactin 3abeef 3abiochemical pathways 3acattle 3aderivatization 3adesmin 3aenzymes 3afluorescent dyes 3aheat shock proteins 3ahydrazides 3ameat tenderness 3amyosin 3aoxidation 3aproteomics 3astructural proteins 3atroponin T 3atwo-dimensional gel electrophoresis 0aBeef cattle 0aProtein oxidation 0aShear force 0a2D-DIGE1 aBraga, Camila Pereira1 aGrove, Ryan Albert1 aRibeiro, Felipe Azevedo1 aCalkins, Chris Richard1 aAdamec, Jiri1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4899-44061 aChardulo, Luis Artur Loyola0 tMeat science.g2019 Feb., v. 148 p.64-71dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl8541x0309-17407nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.meatsci.2018.08.0163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03831naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002000148245007000168300001800238520255000256592002802806596007802834596007002912650003002982650001903012650001303031650000903044650001503053650001303068650002303081650001103104650001603115651001003131700005803141700002703199773012703226856008303353852000903436655001203445IND60753948120221119170225.0211020e202111  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075394812DNAL7 a10.1007/s00382-021-05810-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDemortier, Alan10aIdentifying key driving mechanisms of heat waves in central Chile  ap. 2415-2432.  aThis study explores the main drivers of heat wave (HW) events in central Chile using state-of-the-art reanalysis data (ERA5) and observations during the extended austral summer season (November to March) for the period 1979–2018. Frequency and intensity aspects of the HW events are considered using the total number of the HW events per season and the amplitude. We first contrast ERA5 with several surface meteorological stations in central Chile to evaluate its ability to capture daily maximum temperature variability and the HW events. We then use synoptic- and large-scale fields and teleconnection patterns to address the most favorable conditions of the HW events from a climatological perspective as well as from the extreme January 2017 HW event that swept central Chile with temperature records and wildfires. ERA5 tends to capture temperature extremes and the HW events at the inland stations; on the contrary, it has difficulties in capturing the maximum temperature variability at the coastal stations, which is plausible given the complex terrain features and confined coastal climate zone (only [Formula: see text]7% of all grid boxes within central Chile). The composite HW days based on ERA5 reveals a mid-level trough-ridge dipole pattern exhibiting a blocking anticyclone on the surface over a large part of southwest South America. Relatively dry and warm easterly flow appears to accompany the anomalous warming in a large part of central Chile. The temporal evolution of the HW events yields a wave-like propagation pattern and enhancement of trough-ridge pattern along the South Pacific. This meridional dipole pattern is found to be largely associated with the Pacific South American pattern. In addition, the Madden–Julian Oscillation (MJO) appears to be a key component of the HW events in central Chile. In particular, while active MJO phases 2 and 7 promote sub-seasonal patterns that favor the South Pacific dipole mode, synoptic anomalies can superimpose on them and favor the formation of a migrating anticyclone over central-southern Chile and coastal lows over central Chile. Agreeing with the climatological findings, the extreme January 2017 HW analysis suggests that an eastward migratory mid-latitude trough-ridge pattern associated with MJO phase 2 was at work. We highlight that in addition to large- and synoptic-scale features, sub-synoptic processes such as coastal lows can have an important role in shaping the HW events and can lead to amplification of temperature extremes during the HW events.  aPublisher supplied data  a1120010111200101cFondo Nacional de Desarrollo Científico y Tecnológico  a11170486cFondo Nacional de Desarrollo Científico y Tecnológico 3aMadden-Julian Oscillation 3aclimatic zones 3adynamics 3aheat 3alandscapes 3alatitude 3amigratory behavior 3asummer 3atemperature 3aChile1 aBozkurt, Deniz1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1021-82411 aJacques-Coper, Martín0 tClimate dynamics.g2021 Nov., v. 57, no. 9-10 p.2415-2432dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl3895934x0930-75757nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00382-021-05810-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02778naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001500140245017000155300001800325520137200343592002801715650001501743650001201758650002001770650001201790650001401802650002701816650002101843650001601864650001401880650002701894650003201921650002901953650001301982650002001995700001402015700001502029700001702044700001602061700001602077700001802093773012502111856007502236852000902311655001202320IND60767990720221120064310.0220222e20220221xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076799072DNAL7 a10.1039/d1fo03407c2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGuo, Yiwen10aMedium and long-chain structured triacylglycerol enhances vitamin D bioavailability in an emulsion-based delivery system: combination of in vitro and in vivo studies  ap. 1762-1773.  aVitamin D (VitD) is an essential fat-soluble micronutrient required for maintaining and regulating calcium homeostasis. Although sunlight can provide VitD, epidemiological studies indicate that the occurrence of VitD deficiency and insufficiency is widespread. Lipids are required at all stages of VitD digestion and absorption. In this research two different medium and long-chain triacylglycerol structures, possessing identical fatty acid composition lipids, namely structured triacylglycerol (STG), and physical mixtures of medium/long-chain triacylglycerol (MCT/LCT), were selected. Our results demonstrated that STG had a significant VitD bioavailability compared to MCT/LCT. In terms of the lipid digestion and absorption, the extent of the higher free fatty acid released (69.42%, p < 0.05), extent of lipolysis (89.28%, p < 0.05), lipolysis rate (0.06 s⁻¹, p < 0.05), and the ratio of the long-chain fatty acid to medium-chain fatty acid of STG (4.8, p < 0.05), result in a higher capacity for accommodating VitD when forming mixed micelles (61.31%, p < 0.05). An in vivo animal study also demonstrated that STG significantly increases the delivery ability of VitD (18.75 ng mL⁻¹, p < 0.05). The findings of this work may have unique applications for designing novel interesterified lipids with an effective delivery capacity for fat-soluble nutrients.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3aanimals 3abioavailability 3acalcium 3adigestion 3afatty acid composition 3afree fatty acids 3ahomeostasis 3alipolysis 3along chain fatty acids 3along chain triacylglycerols 3amedium chain fatty acids 3amicelles 3asolar radiation1 aXu, Ying,1 aZhang, Tao1 aWang, Yandan1 aLiu, Ruijie1 aChang, Ming1 aWang, Xingguo0 tFood & function.g2022 Feb. 21, v. 13, no. 4 p.1762-1773dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26907x2042-650X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d1fo03407c3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02774naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245015300169300001600322520131900338592002801657650005301685650001101738650002401749650002301773650002301796650002101819650000801840650002301848650001501871650001801886650002401904650002501928650001001953651002101963700001901984700001802003700002102021700002002042700001802062773011902080856008502199990002302284852000902307655001202316IND60094891320221123034327.0141104e201206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009489132DNAL7 a10.1016/j.diabres.2011.12.0252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPark, So-Jung10aSex differences in the relationship between socioeconomic status and metabolic syndrome: The Korean National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey  ap. 400-406.  aAIMS: To investigate sex differences in the relationship between socioeconomic status (SES) and the prevalence of metabolic syndrome (MetS) in Korean adults. METHODS: We examined the relationship between SES, as measured by household income or education level, and the prevalence of MetS in Korean adults who participated in the 2007–2008 Korean National Health Examination and Nutrition Survey (KNHANES). The adjusted odds ratios (ORs) for MetS were calculated using multivariate logistic regression analysis across household income and education level quartiles. RESULTS: We found significant differences between men and women in the association between SES and MetS, with a positive association for men and an inverse association for women. The adjusted OR and 95% confidence interval (95% CI) for MetS for the highest vs. lowest quartile of household income was 1.59 (1.15–2.20) in men. The adjusted ORs for MetS for the highest vs. lowest quartile of household income and education level were 0.54 (0.41–0.72) and 0.26 (0.17–0.38) in women, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: We found sex differences in the relationship between SES and the prevalence of MetS in Korea. These findings suggest that sex-specific public health interventions that consider SES are needed for the prevention and treatment of MetS.  aPublisher supplied data 3aNational Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 3aadults 3aconfidence interval 3aeducational status 3agender differences 3ahousehold income 3amen 3ametabolic syndrome 3aodds ratio 3apublic health 3aregression analysis 3asocioeconomic status 3awomen 3aKorean Peninsula1 aKang, Hee-Taik1 aNam, Chung-Mo1 aPark, Byoung-Jin1 aLinton, John A.1 aLee, Yong-Jae0 tDiabetes research and clinical practice.g2012 June, v. 96, no. 3 p.400-406dElsevier Ireland Ltdx0168-82277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.diabres.2011.12.0253Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle04290naa a2200793 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002300094040001800117100002800135245012700163300001600290520202200306592002802328650002002356650001802376650001802394650001102412650002402423650001002447650002502457650002102482650000902503650001502512650002002527650002202547650001502569650003302584650001002617650001802627650001702645650002402662650001402686650001402700650001802714650002502732651001402757651001102771651001502782651001602797651001302813651001102826651000902837651001802846651001402864653002202878653003202900653002902932653000902961653000902970653000902979653000802988653000802996653002603004653001803030653001903048653001803067653002803085653002403113700002903137700003603166700003603202700002803238773014003266856006903406852000903475655001203484IND60655518520221122010809.0190801e20190213xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065551852DNAL7 a10.1645/18-512doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSereno-Uribe, Ana Lucia10aAssessing the Taxonomic Validity of Austrodiplostomum spp. (Digenea: Diplostomidae) through Nuclear and Mitochondrial Data  ap. 102-112.  aAdults of the genus Austrodiplostomum are parasites in cormorants of the New World, whereas metacercariae are parasites from eye globe and brain of freshwater and brackish water fishes. In this study, specimens of Austrodiplostomum mordax from South America (type-species) were analyzed together with other specimens of Austrodiplostomum spp. collected from several locations across Middle America and North America. Partial DNA sequences of the mitochondrial gene cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI), the internal transcribed spacers (ITS1, ITS2, and 5.8S gene), and the D2–D3, domains of the large subunit (LSU) of nuclear ribosomal DNA, were generated for both developmental stages and compared with available sequences of Austrodiplostomum spp. Phylogenetic analyses inferred with each molecular marker using maximum likelihood and Bayesian inference revealed the existence of 4 lineages representing 2 described species, A. mordax and Austrodiplostomum compactum (syn. Austrodiplostomum ostrowskiae) and 2 undescribed species of Austrodiplostomum recognized in previous studies. The COI haplotype network inferred with 172 sequences detected 28 haplotypes divided into 4 clusters, separating each other by 33 and 40 substitutions and with a genetic divergence ranging from 9 to 12%. The largest group included specimens identified as A. compactum plus those identified as A. ostrowskiae, supporting the synonymy of both species. As a result, we conclude that A. compactum is widely distributed across the Americas, in locations of the United States, Mexico, El Salvador, Honduras, Costa Rica, Venezuela, Peru, and Brazil. The other 2 undescribed species of the genus Austrodiplostomum were previously recorded in the United States and now are reported in Mexico. These 2 species cannot be described because adult forms have not been found in their definitive hosts. Finally, the species A. mordax has been found only in some lakes from Argentina, and it was validated in this study through molecular analyses.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBayesian theory 3aDiplostomidae 3aPhalacrocorax 3aadults 3abrackish water fish 3abrain 3acytochrome-c oxidase 3adefinitive hosts 3aeyes 3afreshwater 3agenetic markers 3agenetic variation 3ahaplotypes 3ainternal transcribed spacers 3alakes 3ametacercariae 3amitochondria 3amitochondrial genes 3aparasites 3aphylogeny 3aribosomal DNA 3astatistical analysis 3aArgentina 3aBrazil 3aCosta Rica 3aEl Salvador 3aHonduras 3aMexico 3aPeru 3aUnited States 3aVenezuela 0aAustrodiplostomum 0aAustrodiplostomum compactum 0aAustrodiplostomum mordax 0aITS1 0aITS2 0a5.8S 0aLSU 0aCOI 0aPhylogenetic Analyses 0aSouth America 0aMiddle America 0aNorth America 0aNannopterum brasilianus 0aNannopterum auritus1 aGómez, Leopoldo Andrade1 aNúñez, Margarita Ostrowski de1 aPérez-Ponce de León, Gerardo,1 aGarcía-Varela, Martín0 tJournal of parasitology.g2019 Feb. 13, v. 105, no. 1 p.102-112dAmerican Society of ParasitologistswJournal:jnl45570x0022-33957nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1645/18-513Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03356naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002500164245009500189300001800284520181500302592002802117650001002145650002602155650002102181650000902202650001502211650001002226650001602236650001502252650001302267650001102280650001702291650001802308650002102326650001202347650003802359650002702397650002102424650005202445650005902497650001802556651001102574700002902585700001902614700003002633773011802663856004802781852000902829655001202838IND4466343520221120201820.0120815e201209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446634352DNAL7 a219563402pmid7 a10.1007/s10661-011-2358-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGomes, Iracema David10aCan fish gill anomalies be used to assess water quality in freshwater Neotropical systems?  ap. 5523-5531.  aGill anomalies in two fish species (Geophagus brasiliensis and Astyanax bimaculatus) were compared among three freshwater systems with different water quality: one eutrophic river, one eutrophic reservoir, and one oligotrophic reservoir. The raised hypotheses are that reservoirs with low water quality (eutrophic) have fish with more gills anomalies compared with reservoirs with high water quality (oligotrophic), and that the more stable environmental conditions of eutrophic rivers have fish with better healthy conditions than eutrophic reservoirs that have lesser stable environmental conditions. Gills of 36 adult individuals of G. brasiliensis and 23 of A. bimaculatus collected during the winter 2008 and winter 2009 were examined, and the proportions of occurrence of nine histological alterations were compared for the two species among the three systems using a binomial t test for independent samples. Histological changes in fish gills that are reversible and unspecific, such as epithelial lifting, interstitial edema, leukocyte infiltration, hyperplasia of the epithelial cells, lamellar fusion, and vasodilatation were common in both fish species in the three systems. However, lamellar aneurism, which is a more serious and often irreversible anomaly, and lamellar blood congestion occurred only in fish from the two reservoirs. Alternatively, necrosis occurred more in fish from the river. Fish gill anomalies in both species did not differ between the two reservoirs, despite having different water quality. We rejected the hypothesis that reservoirs with lower water quality have fish with more gill injuries compared with high water quality reservoirs. Moreover, the eutrophic river seems to affect differently the healthy condition of fish species, compared with the eutrophic reservoir.  aPublisher supplied data 3aedema 3aenvironmental factors 3aepithelial cells 3afish 3afreshwater 3agills 3ahyperplasia 3aleukocytes 3anecrosis 3arivers 3avasodilation 3awater quality 3awater reservoirs 2aAnimals 2aEnvironmental Monitoringxmethods 2aFresh Waterxchemistry 2aGillsxpathology 2aWater Pollutants, Chemicalxanalysisxtoxicity. 2aWater Pollution, Chemicalxstatistics & numerical data 2aWater Quality 0aBrazil1 aNascimento, Aparecida A.1 aSales, Armando1 aAraújo, Francisco Gerson0 tEnvironmental monitoring and assessment.g2012 Sept., v. 184, no. 9 p.5523-5531dSpringer-Verlagx0167-63697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-011-2358-2  aDNAL 7aarticle02926naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002400151245009600175300001600271520162200287536007901909592002801988596002802016650002302044650001102067650001302078650000902091650001102100650002302111650002002134650001502154650001102169700001902180700001702199700002602216700002602242700001602268700002102284773010402305856008602409852000902495655001202504IND60788311820221119200451.0220813e20210703xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078831182DNAL7 a10.1080/00063657.2022.20953502doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 avan der Winden, Jan14aThe influence of weather on the migration behaviour of Eurasian Bitterns Botaurus stellaris  ap. 370-380.  aMigration studies of tagged Eurasian Bitterns Botaurus stellaris provide information on the behaviour of this secretive species in relation to weather conditions. To study if cold spells trigger southward migration in resident Eurasian Bitterns. To describe migratory behaviour including flight routes, altitudes, flight direction in relation to wind speed and direction, and general characteristics of stopping sites. Six adult Eurasian Bitterns from Dutch breeding areas were followed for two to five years using ARGOS-PTT/GPS transmitters or GPS trackers. Four individuals remained at the breeding sites in winter and did not migrate in response to cold spells. Two individuals covered distances of 300 and 1600 km between stopping sites. They migrated predominantly at night, but over the Sahara they extended flights into daylight hours. Depending on wind assistance, flight speeds (groundspeed) varied between 3.6 and 26 ms⁻¹. Flight altitude varied from just above sea level when facing headwinds, to almost 2000 m above sea level under tail wind conditions. Repeatedly tracked individuals showed substantial variation in routes and stopping sites between successive migrations. These flight patterns appeared influenced by the speed and direction of the winds encountered en route. Eurasian Bitterns were either migratory or resident and the latter individuals did not perform facultative movements at the onset of cold spells. The flight speed, flight altitudes, and routes of migrating birds were influenced by wind conditions. This likely explains the variable use of stopping sites between years.  aLandschap Noord-Holland funded the project executed by Bureau Waardenburg.  aPublisher supplied data  cLandschap Noord-Holland 3aBotaurus stellaris 3aadults 3aaltitude 3acold 3aflight 3amigratory behavior 3asolar radiation 3awind speed 3awinter1 aHogeweg, Niels1 aBaaij, Edwin1 avan Horssen, Peter W.1 aShamoun-Baranes, Judy1 aVos, René,1 aPiersma, Theunis0 tBird study.g2021 July 03, v. 68, no. 3 p.370-380dTaylor & FranciswJournal:11668x1944-67057nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00063657.2022.20953503Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03918naa a2200661 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001600140245014600156300001600302520203800318592002802356650003702384650002002421650001902441650001102460650001902471650002602490650002002516650001502536650001802551650001302569650001902582650001202601650001102613650001902624650001302643650001302656650001402669650001902683650001502702650001502717650001302732650002002745650002702765651001802792651001102810700001602821700001902837700001302856700001802869700001602887700001402903700001502917700002402932700001502956700002102971700001902992700001303011700002103024773011603045856007403161852000903235655001203244IND60342790620221120231826.0150810e201507  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6034279062DNAL7 a10.1111/ejss.122692doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGentsch, N.10aProperties and bioavailability of particulate and mineral‐associated organic matter in Arctic permafrost soils, Lower Kolyma Region, Russia  ap. 722-734.  aPermafrost degradation may cause strong feedbacks of arctic ecosystems to global warming, but this will depend on if, and to what extent, organic matter (OM) is protected against biodegradation by mechanisms other than freezing and anoxia. Here, we report on the amount, chemical composition and bioavailability of particulate (POM) and mineral‐associated OM (MOM) in permafrost soils of the East Siberian Arctic. The average total organic carbon (OC) stock across all soils was 24.0 ± 6.7 kg m⁻² within 100 cm soil depth. Density fractionation (density cut‐off 1.6 g cm⁻³) revealed that 54 ± 16% of the total soil OC and 64 ± 18% of OC in subsoil horizons was bound to minerals. As well as sorption of OM to clay‐sized minerals (R² = 0.80; P < 0.01), co‐precipitation of OM with hydrolyzable metals may also transfer carbon into the mineral‐bound fraction. Carbon:nitrogen ratios, stable carbon and nitrogen isotopes, ¹³C‐NMR and X‐ray photoelectron spectroscopy showed that OM is transformed in permafrost soils, which is a prerequisite for the formation of mineral‐organic associations. Mineral‐associated OM in deeper soil was enriched in ¹³C and ¹⁵N, and had narrow C:N and large alkyl C:(O‐/N‐alkyl C) ratios, indicating an advanced stage of decomposition. Despite being up to several thousands of years old, when incubated under favourable conditions (60% water‐holding capacity, 15°C, adequate nutrients, 90 days), only 1.5–5% of the mineral‐associated OC was released as CO₂. In the topsoils, POM had the largest mineralization but was even less bioavailable than the MOM in subsoil horizons. Our results suggest that the formation of mineral‐organic associations acts as an important additional factor in the stabilization of OM in permafrost soils. Although the majority of MOM was not prone to decomposition under favourable conditions, mineral‐organic associations host a readily accessible carbon fraction, which may actively participate in ecosystem carbon exchange.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3abioavailability 3abiodegradation 3acarbon 3acarbon dioxide 3acarbon nitrogen ratio 3acoprecipitation 3aecosystems 3afractionation 3afreezing 3aglobal warming 3ahypoxia 3ametals 3amineralization 3aminerals 3anitrogen 3anutrients 3aorganic matter 3apermafrost 3asoil depth 3asorption 3astable isotopes 3awater holding capacity 3aArctic region 3aRussia1 aMikutta, R.1 aShibistova, O.1 aWild, B.1 aSchnecker, J.1 aRichter, A.1 aUrich, T.1 aGittel, A.1 aŠantrůčková, H.1 aBárta, J.1 aLashchinskiy, N.1 aMueller, C.

We administered a two-phase survey to key immunization stakeholders to assess the utility and application of GVAP, including how it has impacted country immunization programs, and to find ways to strengthen the next 10-year plan.For the Phase I survey, an online questionnaire was sent to global immunization stakeholders in summer 2017. The Phase II survey was sent to regional and national immunization stakeholders in summer 2018, including WHO Regional Advisors on Immunization, Expanded Programme on Immunization managers, and WHO and UNICEF country representatives from 20 countries. Countries were selected based on improvements (10) versus decreases (10) in DTP3 coverage from 2010 to 2016.Global immunization stakeholders (n = 38) cite global progress in improving vaccine delivery (88%) and engaging civil society organizations as advocates for vaccines (83%). Among regional and national immunization stakeholders (n = 58), 70% indicated reaching mobile and underserved populations with vaccination activities as a major challenge. The top ranked activities for helping country programs achieve progress toward GVAP goals include improved monitoring of vaccination coverage and upgrading disease surveillance systems. Most respondents (96%) indicated GVAP as useful for determining immunization priorities and 95% were supportive of a post-2020 GVAP strategy.Immunization stakeholders see GVAP as a useful tool, and there is cause for excitement as the global immunization community looks toward the next decade of vaccines. The next 10-year plan should attempt to increase political will, align immunization activities with other health system agendas, and address important issues like reaching mobile/migrant populations and improving data reporting systems.  aPublisher supplied data 3aWorld Health Organization 3adisease surveillance 3amanagers 3amonitoring 3apolitics 3aquestionnaires 3asociety 3astakeholders 3asummer 3asurveys 3avaccination 3avaccines 0aGlobal vaccine action plan 0aVaccine-preventable diseases 0aVaccines 0aImmunization 0aImmunization programs 0aSurveys and questionnaires 0aGVAP 0aWHO 0aUNICEF 0aSAGE 0aDTP3 0aNITAG 0aEPI 0aCSOs 0aRVAPs 0aVPD 0aSIAs 0aPCV1 aHinman, Alan R.1 aCochi, Stephen L.1 aGaron, Julie R.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9816-96451 aRodewald, Lance E.1 aNowak, Glen1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9153-21891 aMcKinlay, Mark A.1 aMast, Eric E.1 aOrenstein, Walter A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3932-82090 tVaccine.g2019 Aug. 14, v. 37, no. 35 p.4928-4936dElsevier LtdaElsevier LtdwJournal:6210x0264-410X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2019.07.0423Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03099naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245015800170300001800328520185700346592002802203650001102231650001602242650002002258650002102278650001202299650001502311650005002326650001502376650001502391650002502406650001402431650002302445650001002468651001802478700002402496773012102520856005102641852000902692655001202701IND50088008120221117200757.0140412e20121010xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5008800812DNAL7 a10.1080/01431161.2012.6806152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKwon, Youngsang10aUse of pixel- and plot-scale screening variables to validate MODIS GPP predictions with Forest Inventory and Analysis NPP measures across the eastern USA  ap. 6122-6148.  aModerate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) estimates of gross primary production (GPP) were validated using field-based estimates of net primary production from the Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) Program across the eastern USA. A total of 54 969 MODIS pixels and co-located FIA plots were analysed to validate MODIS GPP estimates. We used a data resolution of individual MODIS pixels and co-located FIA plots, and used detailed pixel- and plot-specific attributes by applying screening variables (SVs) to assess conditions under which MODIS GPP was most strongly validated. Eight SVs were used to test six hypotheses about the conditions under which MODIS GPP would be most strongly validated. The six hypotheses addressed were (1) MODIS pixel quality checks, (2) FIA plot quality checks, (3) land-cover classification comparability of co-located MODIS pixels and FIA plots, (4) FIA plot homogeneity, (5) FIA plot tree density and (6) MODIS seasonal variation. SVs were assessed in terms of trade-off between improved relations and reduced number of samples. MODIS seasonal variation and FIA plot tree density were the two most efficient SVs, followed by basic quality checks for each data set. Sequential application of SVs indicated that combined usage of five of the eight SVs provided an efficient data set of 17 090 co-located MODIS pixels and FIA plots, which raised the Pearson correlation coefficient from 0.01 for the Complete data set of 54 969 plots to 0.48 for this screened subset of 17 090 plots. The screened subset of plots exhibited good representation of the Complete data set in terms of species abundance, plot distribution and mean productivity. We conclude that the application of SVs provides a useful approach to ensure compatibility of two data sets for broad-scale forest carbon budget analysis and monitoring.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon 3acorrelation 3adata collection 3aforest inventory 3aforests 3aland cover 3amoderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer 3amonitoring 3aprediction 3aprimary productivity 3ascreening 3aseasonal variation 3atrees 3aUnited States1 aLarsen, Chris P.

Data from a winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.)/summer fallow rotation experiment, in eastern Oregon, was used to evaluate long-term effects of tillage, N, soil depth, and precipitation on yield. The soil is a Walla Walla silt loam (coarse-silty, mixed, mesic Typic Haploxeroll). The experiment consisted of three tillage treatments (moldboard plow, offset disk, and subsurface sweep) and six N treatments. Four main time periods (1944–1951, 1952–1961, 1962–1987, 1988–1997), were identified, within which experimental treatments were consistently maintained. Depth to bedrock ranged from 1.2 to 3.0 m. Yield was significantly greater (>300 kg ha⁻¹) for the moldboard plow than for the subsurface sweep in all time periods. Yield was generally greater (>100 kg ha⁻¹) for the moldboard plow than for the offset disk, but only significantly in Time Periods 3 and 4. For Periods 1 and 2, the addition of N fertilizer tended to produce higher yields, regardless of quantity or distribution of rainfall. For Period 3, yield did not increase with the addition of more than 45 kg N ha⁻¹, which we attribute to below-normal precipitation. For Period 4, when precipitation was above average, yield increased with the addition of up to 90 kg N ha⁻¹ Results demonstrated that despite beneficial effects on soil properties, conservation tillage has tended to be less productive for this cropping system than moldboard plowing, probably due to lack of downy brome weed control in the conservation tillage systems.  aPublisher supplied data 3aconservation tillage 3adiscing 3along term experiments 3aplowing 3afertilizer rates 3asoil depth 3arain 3aTriticum aestivum 3agrain yield 3awinter wheat 3anitrogen fertilizers 3aOregon1 aPayne, W.

D.10aDecontamination of an Industrial Cotton Dyeing Wastewater by Chemical and Biological Processes  ap. 2412-2421.  aThe organic matter mineralization, decolorization, biodegradability improvement, and toxicity reduction of an industrial cotton dyeing wastewater were investigated. Different treatment approaches, including single and integrated processes, were studied, namely, coagulation/flocculation per se and its combination with Fenton oxidation (approach 1), the Fenton process alone (approach 2) and its integration with either coagulation/flocculation (approach 3) or biological oxidation in a sequential batch reactor (approach 4). All approaches provided a wastewater that meets the Portuguese legislated discharge limits; however, approaches 1 and 3 require smaller operating costs (1.0 €/m³) with global removal efficiencies for these two strategies of 70.8% for chemical oxygen demand (COD), 66.1% for dissolved organic carbon (DOC), and 47.6% for biological oxygen demand (BOD₅) in approach 1 and 69.2% for COD, 60.4% for BOD₅, and 72.4% for DOC in approach 3, along with almost complete color removal in both strategies and toxicity reduction (0.0% inhibition of Vibrio fischeri in the effluent from approach 1). A slight increase of the effluent biodegradability was also observed (BOD₅:COD increased from 0.26 to 0.33–0.46, and specific oxygen uptake rate (SOUR) increased from 8.85 to 9.3–11.3 mgO₂/(gVSS h)), depending on the treatment approach. The use of a cheap process (coagulation/flocculation) as pretreatment allowed reducing the amount of reagents needed in the Fenton process, making the latter treatment slightly cheaper and thereby reducing the overall costs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aVibrio fischeri 3abiochemical oxygen demand 3abiodegradability 3achemical oxygen demand 3acoagulation 3acotton 3adecolorization 3adecontamination 3adissolved organic carbon 3adyeing 3aengineering 3aflocculation 3amineralization 3aoperating costs 3aoxidation 3aoxygen 3atoxicity 3awastewater1 aMadeira, Luis M.1 aBoaventura, Rui A.

The methods (ultrasound-assisted extraction and microwave-assisted extraction) were compared to conventional acid extraction (literature method). The determination of trace elements by flame atomic absorption spectrometry (F AAS) and graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrometry (GF AAS) was investigated. The results of the three methods did not show any significant difference at a confidence level of 95% for all analytes. The two new methods showed good precision (RSD < 10%), accuracy (the recoveries from suspended particulate samples ranged from 83 to 114%) and reduced time required for sample preparation (approximately 10 min) with small volumes of acid. Using diluted aqua regia, the microwave extraction method was then employed to determine Al, As, Cd, Cr, Cu, Fe, Mn, Pb and Zn from deposited particulate matter (DPM) samples from the city of Juiz de Fora, MG, Brazil, from samples collected passively on cellulose acetate filters. Fe, Al, Zn and Mn were the most abundant elements present in the samples, followed by Cu, Pb, Cr, As and Cd.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaluminum 3aaqua regia 3aarsenic 3aatomic absorption spectrometry 3acadmium 3acellulose acetate 3achemical species 3achromium 3acopper 3afilters 3airon 3alead 3amanganese 3amicrowave treatment 3aparticulates 3aultrasonic treatment 3azinc 3aBrazil1 aFerreira, C.

According to different ship courses, the algorithm calculates the wind grid index values in eight different situations, and a common computational formula is summarised. The wind grids around a ship route can be classified into ‘best-fitting’ grids and ‘additional’ grids, which are stored in such a way that, for example, when the data has a high-spacing resolution, only the ‘best-fitting’ grids around ship routes are extracted. Finally, the algorithm was implemented and simulated with MATLAB programming. As the simulation results indicate, the algorithm designed in this paper achieved wind grid data extraction in different situations and further resolved the extraction problem of meteorological and hydrogeological field grids around ship routes efficiently. Thus, it can provide a great support for optimal ship routing related to meteorological factors.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3acomputer software 3aships 3awind1 aZhang, Yingjun1 aYue, Xingwang1 aGao, Zongjiang0 tTheoretical and applied climatology.g2015 May, v. 120, no. 3-4 p.555-561dSpringer ViennawJournal:jnl3932171x0177-798X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00704-014-1196-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02261naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002300094040001800117100003000135245018700165300001400352520074400366592002801110650001601138650002101154650001501175650001301190650001001203650001201213650001601225650001501241650002801256650002301284650001901307651001101326653001901337653002301356653001801379653001801397653000801415653002601423653002601449700003601475700002601511700002701537773013701564856006901701852000901770655001201779IND60655518820221121232843.0190801e20190208xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065551882DNAL7 a10.1645/18-762doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTrejo-Palacios, Susana J.12aA New Species of Morelacarus (Acariformes: Prostigmata: Leeuwenhoekiidae) Associated with Sceloporus grammicus (Squamata: Phrynosomatidae) from the Mexican Plateau, Zacatecas, Mexico  ap. 85-91.  aA new species of chigger mites, Morelacarus uazi n. sp., parasitizing lizards of the species Sceloporusgrammicus from Mazapil, Zacatecas, Mexico, is described and illustrated.

The aberrant communication between glioblastoma cells and tumor microenvironment represents one of the major factors regulating glioblastoma malignancy and angiogenic properties. Emerging evidence implicates sphingosine-1-phosphate signaling in the pathobiology of glioblastoma and angiogenesis, but its role in glioblastoma-endothelial crosstalk remains largely unknown. In this study, we sought to determine whether the crosstalk between glioblastoma cells and brain endothelial cells regulates sphingosine-1-phosphate signaling in the tumor microenvironment. Using human glioblastoma and brain endothelial cell lines, as well as primary brain endothelial cells derived from human glioblastoma, we report that glioblastoma-co-culture promotes the expression, activity, and plasma membrane enrichment of sphingosine kinase 2 in brain endothelial cells, leading to increased cellular level of sphingosine-1-phosphate, and significant potentiation of its secretion. In turn, extracellular sphingosine-1-phosphate stimulates glioblastoma cell proliferation, and brain endothelial cells migration and angiogenesis. We also show that, after co-culture, glioblastoma cells exhibit enhanced expression of S1P₁ and S1P₃, the sphingosine-1-phosphate receptors that are of paramount importance for cell growth and invasivity. Collectively, our results envision glioblastoma-endothelial crosstalk as a multi-compartmental strategy to enforce pro-tumoral sphingosine-1-phosphate signaling in the glioblastoma microenvironment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aangiogenesis 3abrain 3acell growth 3acell lines 3acell proliferation 3acoculture 3aendothelial cells 3ahumans 3aneoplasms 3aplasma membrane 3areceptors 3asecretion 3asphingosine 0abECs 0aBSA 0aDMEM 0aERK 0aEC 0aFBS 0aFFA-BSA 0aGEC 0aGBM 0aHPTLC 0aS1P 0aS1PRs 0aSph 0aSphK 0aVEGF 0aBrain endothelial cells 0aGlioblastoma cells 0aSphingosine-1-phosphate 0aSphingosine kinase 21 aAnelli, Viviana1 aGuarnaccia, Laura1 aNavone, Stefania1 aBeretta, Matteo1 aMoccia, Francesco1 aTringali, Cristina1 aUrechie, Vasile1 aCampanella, Rolando1 aMarfia, Giovanni1 aRiboni, Laura0 tBiochimica et biophysica acta.g2018 Oct., v. 1863, no. 10 p.1179-1192dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12057x1388-19817nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbalip.2018.07.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02313naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002000140245013700160300001600297520109300313592002801406650002201434650002401456650001201480650000901492650002301501650003301524650001601557650001801573650001601591700002001607700001801627700002401645700002301669700003001692773012201722856007401844852000901918655001201927IND60617740120221121001529.0181026e20180124xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061774012DNAL7 a10.1039/c7fo01601h2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOludemi, Taofiq10aExtraction of triterpenoids and phenolic compounds from Ganoderma lucidum: optimization study using the response surface methodology  ap. 209-226.  aThe extraction of triterpenoids and phenolic compounds from Ganoderma lucidum was optimized by using the response surface methodology (RSM), using heat and ultrasound assisted extraction techniques (HAE and UAE). The obtained results were compared with that of the standard Soxhlet procedure. RSM was applied using a circumscribed central composite design with three variables (time, ethanol content, and temperature or ultrasonic power) and five levels. The conditions that maximize the responses (extraction yield, triterpenoids and total phenolics) were: 78.9 min, 90.0 °C and 62.5% ethanol and 40 min, 100.0 W and 89.5% ethanol for HAE and UAE, respectively. The latter was the most effective, resulting in an extraction yield of 4.9 ± 0.6% comprising a content of 435.6 ± 21.1 mg g⁻¹ of triterpenes and 106.6 ± 16.2 mg g⁻¹ of total phenolics. The optimized extracts were fully characterized in terms of individual phenolic compounds and triterpenoids by HPLC-DAD-ESI/MS.

Within this context, the present study aims at exploring the relative influence of growing season climate on the yields of major cereals (hard and soft wheat, maize, and barley) on a regional scale in Greece. To this end, crop–climate relationships and the impacts of climate trends over the period 1978–2005 were explored using linear regression and change point analysis (CPA). Climate data used include maximum (Tx) and minimum temperature (Tn), diurnal temperature range (Tr), precipitation (Prec), and solar radiation (Rad). Temperature effects were the most substantial. Yields reduced by 1.8–7.1 %/°C with increasing Tx and by 1.4–6.1 %/°C with decreasing Tr. The warming trends of Tn caused bilateral yield effects (from −3.7 to 8.4 %/°C). The fewer significantly increasing Rad and decreasing Prec anomalies were associated with larger yield decreases (within the range of 2.2 % MJ/m²/day (for maize) to 4.9 % MJ/m²/day (for hard wheat)) and smaller yield increases (from 0.04 to 1.4 %/mm per decade), respectively. Wheat and barley—the most vulnerable cereals—were most affected by the trends of extreme temperatures and least by Tr. On the contrary, solar radiation has proven to be the least affecting climate variable on all cereals. Despite the similarity in the direction of crop responses with both analyses, yield changes were much more substantial in the case of CPA analysis. In conclusion, regional climate change has affected Greek cereal productivity, in a few, but important for cereal production, regions. The results of this study are expected to be valuable in anticipating the effects of weather/climate on other warm regions worldwide, where the upper temperature limit for some cereals and further changes in climate may push them past suitability for their cultivation.  aPublisher supplied data 3abarley 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3acorn 3agrowing season 3alinear models 3asolar radiation 3atemperature 3awheat 3aGreece0 tTheoretical and applied climatology.g2015 May, v. 120, no. 3-4 p.417-432dSpringer ViennawJournal:jnl3932171x0177-798X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00704-014-1179-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03333naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006400148245014000212300001200352520181300364592002802177596007102205650005002276650002302326650001402349650002002363650001302383650003702396650002902433650001102462650001402473650001402487650000902501651001302510700002802523700003502551700003002586700005302616773015102669856008202820852000902902655001202911IND60764359220221118132908.0220818e202202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076435922DNAL7 a10.1007/s10661-022-09776-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSouffit, Gondji Dieu1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7427-023910aAssessment of trace elements pollution and their potential health risks in the cobalt–nickel bearing areas of Lomié, East Cameroon  ap. 127.  aA study of trace elements pollution in the cobalt–nickel mining area of Nkamouna-Kongo (East Region of Cameroon) and their intimation to the risk of human exposure was carried out. A large spatial variability of concentrations was observed in the geochemical analysis of the trace elements in the thirty samples investigated. Trace element pollution in the investigated samples was assessed using the Regional Screening Level calculator of Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) and the collected sample were analyzed using a SPECTRO XEPOS Energy Dispersive X-Ray Fluorescence analyzer (ED-XRF). The trace element concentrations in the analyzed samples followed the following order: Fe > Cr > Mn > Zr > Ni > Ba > Rb > Cu > Zn > Sr > Ga > Pb > Co > Rb > As > Sn. The averages of trace elements contamination factors followed a decreasing order:: Cr > Ni > Fe > As > Co > Cu > Zr > Ga > Pb > Mn > Zn > Y > Rb > Ba > Sn > Sr. Enrichment factor studies revealed that chromium (Cr) was severely enriched (indicating that Cr is the main element of the anthropic load) while elements such as Ni, Ba, Mn, Co, Cu, Zn, Ga, As, and Pb were moderately enriched. The associated health risk of human exposure was investigated using the Regional Screening Level of Environmental Protection Agency. It was found out that the carcinogenic risk to the exposed population from ingestion is high (2.5E-03), while the dermal risk is moderate (7.08E-04) and the inhalation risk is low (2.50E-07). The total non-carcinogenic risk from trace elements exposure for adults (HI = 1.5) and children (HI = 1.47E + 01) indicates that non-carcinogenic effects may occur in the vicinity of the study area.  aPublisher supplied data  aBIP 2019cMinistry of Scientific Research and Innovation, Cameroon 3aUnited States Environmental Protection Agency 3aat-risk population 3abreathing 3acarcinogenicity 3achromium 3aenergy-dispersive X-ray analysis 3aenvironmental protection 3ahumans 3aingestion 3apollution 3arisk 3aCameroon1 aMohamadou, Lawan Loubou1 aGuembou Shouop, Cebastien Joel1 aBeyala Ateba, Jean Félix1 aSaïdou-,1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7427-02390 tEnvironmental monitoring and assessment.g2022 Feb., v. 194, no. 2 p.127-127dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:jnl33242x0167-63697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-022-09776-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03204naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245012500159300001600284500001500300520189400315592002802209650002802237650001802265650001202283650002402295650001002319650001802329650000902347650001802356650001702374650001802391650001702409650000902426650001602435650000902451650001502460653001902475700001502494700001702509700002102526773011602547856007402663852000902737655001202746IND60342791420221120231658.0150810e201507  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6034279142DNAL7 a10.1111/ejss.122282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWetterlind, J.10aExploring the predictability of soil texture and organic matter content with a commercial integrated soil profiling tool  ap. 631-638.  a2019-12-05  aIn soil mapping, combining information from conceptually different proximal soil sensors can increase the accuracy of prediction and robustness of the model when compared with using individual sensors. In this study the predictability of soil texture (clay, silt and sand fractions) and soil organic matter (SOM) content was tested with a commercial integrated soil profiling tool that included sensors for measuring apparent electrical conductivity (ECₐ), reflectance in the visible and near‐infrared (vis‐NIR) parts of the electromagnetic spectrum and insertion force (IF). The measurements were made at 20 locations on each of two Swedish farms. At every location, sensor measurements were made at 1.5‐cm intervals from the soil surface to a depth of 0.8 m. Soil samples were collected close to the sensor measurement points and analysed for texture and SOM content. Farm‐specific calibrations were developed for texture and SOM with each sensor separately and with combinations of all three sensors. The calibrations were made using both partial least squares regression (PLSR) and simple linear regression. The results for the two farms were quite consistent in terms of rank in prediction performance between the individual sensors and the sensor combinations. The vis‐NIR spectrometer was the best individual sensor for predicting the soil properties tested on both farms, with root mean square error of cross‐validation (RMSECV) of 0.3–0.5% for SOM, about 6% for clay and silt and 10–11% for sand. The inclusion of IF reduced the RMSECV for predictions of SOM content by about 10%. For soil texture, including ECₐ reduced the RMSECV on average for all particle size fractions by 5–10%. However, the small improvements obtained by combining sensors do not provide strong support for combining vis‐NIR sensor measurements with measurements of ECₐ and or IF.  aPublisher supplied data 3aelectrical conductivity 3alinear models 3atexture 3asoil organic matter 3afarms 3aleast squares 3aclay 3aparticle size 3asoil surveys 3asoil sampling 3asoil texture 3asand 3areflectance 3asilt 3aprediction 0aorganic matter1 aPiikki, K.1 aStenberg, B.1 aSöderström, M.0 tEuropean journal of soil science.g2015 July, v. 66, no. 4 p.631-638dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx1351-07547nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ejss.122283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03277naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001900145245010500164300001600269500002000285520147300305592002801778596004401806596002801850596009001878596008601968650002502054650000802079650001502087650001502102650002002117650002102137650001602158650002302174650001902197650002902216650001502245650001602260650001302276650001202289650002102301650002102322650002002343650001602363700005902379700002902438700006302467773012902530856007902659852000902738655001202747IND60627921220221120091942.0190128e201901  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062792122DNAL7 a10.1111/1462-2920.144592doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAkkaya, Özlem10aEvolving metabolism of 2,4‐dinitrotoluene triggers SOS‐independent diversification of host cells  ap. 314-326.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe molecular mechanisms behind the mutagenic effect of reactive oxygen species (ROS) released by defective metabolization of xenobiotic 2,4‐dinitrotoluene (DNT) by a still‐evolving degradation pathway were studied. To this end, the genes required for biodegradation of DNT from Burkholderia cepacia R34 were implanted in Escherichia coli and the effect of catabolizing the nitroaromatic compound monitored with stress‐related markers and reporters. Such a proxy of the naturally‐occurring scenario faithfully recreated the known accumulation of ROS caused by faulty metabolism of DNT and the ensuing onset of an intense mutagenesis regime. While ROS triggered an oxidative stress response, neither homologous recombination was stimulated nor the recA promoter activity increased during DNT catabolism. Analysis of single‐nucleotide changes occurring in rpoB during DNT degradation suggested a relaxation of DNA replication fidelity rather than direct damage to DNA. Mutants frequencies were determined in strains defective in either converting DNA damage into mutagenesis or mediating inhibition of mismatch repair through a general stress response. The results revealed that the mutagenic effect of ROS was largely SOS‐independent and stemmed instead from stress‐induced changes of rpoS functionality. Evolution of novel metabolic properties thus resembles the way sublethal antibiotic concentrations stimulate the appearance of novel resistance genes.  aPublisher supplied data  cDanish Council for Independent Research  cNovo Nordisk Foundation  aH2020‐FET‐OPEN‐RIA‐2017‐1‐766975cMinistry of Economy and Competitiveness  aEUH2020‐BIOTEC‐2014‐2015‐6335536cMinistry of Economy and Competitiveness 3aBurkholderia cepacia 3aDNA 3aDNA damage 3aDNA repair 3aDNA replication 3aEscherichia coli 3aantibiotics 3abase pair mismatch 3abiodegradation 3ahomologous recombination 3ametabolism 3amutagenesis 3amutagens 3amutants 3aoxidative stress 3aresistance genes 3astress response 3axenobiotics1 aNikel, Pablo I.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9313-74811 aPérez‐Pantoja, Danilo1 ade Lorenzo, Víctor1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6041-27310 tEnvironmental microbiology.g2019 Jan., v. 21, no. 1 p.314-326dJohn Wiley & Sons, Inc.wJournal:jnl3867075x1462-29127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1462-2920.144593Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02805naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002100150245010400171300001600275520142600291592002801717650001301745650001501758650002501773650001901798650001601817650001101833650001301844650001701857650001901874650001401893650002001907653001901927653002501946653003201971653001002003700001402013700002202027700002202049700002302071700002402094700002702118773009702145856008402242852000902326655001202335IND60561248920221118064643.0170607e20141101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056124892DNAL7 a10.1016/j.memsci.2014.06.0322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPasco, Elodie V.10aPolyelectrolyte multilayers as anti-adhesive membrane coatings for virus concentration and recovery  ap. 140-150.  aCrossflow membrane filtration is emerging as a concentration method for the recovery and detection of viruses in large volumes of water. To increase virus recovery, an ultrafiltration membrane is usually “blocked” with a proteinaceous solution or a chemical dispersant. This proof-of-concept study explores a novel approach using controlled and rapid (<1h) layer-by-layer adsorption of polyelectrolytes to form an anti-adhesive, sacrificial layer on the membrane surface. Compared to membranes blocked with calf serum (CS), membranes coated with polyelectrolyte multilayer (PEM) films show significantly higher pre-elution recoveries of P22 bacteriophage from both deionized water (80% versus 27% recovery) and from MBR effluent (47% versus 35% recovery) under high crossflow conditions. Calculations of virus–membrane interaction energies confirm that the higher recoveries with PEM-coated membranes are due to their higher charge and hydrophilicity relative to CS-blocked membranes. The high pre-elution recovery from simple water matrices with PEM-coated membranes might eliminate the need for elution and backflushing steps, thus reducing both the time required for pathogen concentration and the volume of the final sample. The proposed methodology can be used to guide the rational design of membrane surfaces with controllable adhesion properties with respect to a broad range of viruses and other pathogens.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadhesion 3aadsorption 3aartificial membranes 3abacteriophages 3ablood serum 3acalves 3acoatings 3aelectrolytes 3ahydrophilicity 3apathogens 3aultrafiltration 0aVirus recovery 0aSample concentration 0aPolyelectrolyte multilayers 0aXDLVO1 aShi, Hang1 aXagoraraki, Irene1 aHashsham, Syed A.1 aParent, Kristin N.1 aBruening, Merlin L.1 aTarabara, Volodymyr V.0 tJournal of Membrane Science.g2014 Nov. 01, v. 469 p.140-150dElsevier B.V.x0376-73887nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.memsci.2014.06.0323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02347naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002000139245017500159300001800334520118500352592002801537650001601565650001901581650001101600650002601611650002201637650001801659650001301677650004401690650001001734650001601744700002001760773013301780856007501913852000901988655001201997IND60538226220221118091646.0160815e20140212xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053822622DNAL7 a10.1021/ie402943k2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAggarwal, Rajni10aSynthesis, Characterization, and Evaluation of Surface Properties of Cyclohexyloxyoxoethylbipyridinium Gemini Amphiphiles, and a Comparison with Single-Tailed Amphiphiles  ap. 2549-2557.  aCyclohexyloxyoxoethylbipyridinium gemini amphiphiles have been synthesized in a two-step methodology. In the first step, cyclohexanol was esterified with chloroacetic acid or bromoacetic acid to get cyclohexyl-2-chloro (or bromo) ethanoates (3a/3b). These esters in the second step were reacted with either 4,4′-bipyridine or 2,2′-bipyridine to get the respective bipyridinium salts. The structure of these amphiphiles has been established by infrared (IR) spectroscopy, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), and mass spectroscopy. The interfacial parameters like counterion binding (β), maximum surface excess concentration (Γₘₐₓ), minimum area per molecule (Aₘᵢₙ) of gemini amphiphiles have been evaluated and compared with single-tailed amphiphiles. A comparison of the critical micelle concentration (CMC) value of these gemini amphiphiles with corresponding single-tailed amphiphiles indicates that the geminis have CMC values 10-fold less than that of the single-tailed amphiphiles. The corresponding hexafluorophosphate and tetrafluoroborate gemini amphiphiles were also prepared. The melting points of monomeric and gemini amphiphiles has also been compared.  aPublisher supplied data 3aengineering 3aesterification 3aesters 3ainfrared spectroscopy 3amass spectrometry 3amelting point 3amicelles 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3asalts 3asurfactants1 aSingh, Sukhprit0 tIndustrial & Engineering Chemistry Research.g2014 Feb. 12, v. 53, no. 6 p.2549-2557dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-50457nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fie402943k3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02942naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006100148245015400209300001200363520192200375592002802297650001402325650001802339650002002357650002502377650001902402773015102421856008302572852000902655655001202664IND60764359420221118132913.0220818e202202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076435942DNAL7 a10.1007/s10661-021-09744-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHansen, Thomas F.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3796-755210aMeasuring flow speeds in natural waters by training an artificial neural network to analyze high-frequency flow-induced vibrations of tethered floats  ap. 129.  aMeasuring water currents in natural waters is limited by the cost of sensors. Standard sonar-based acoustic current Doppler profilers (ADCPs) are high cost, about $10–20 K per unit. Tilt current meters (TCMs) are much cheaper. They consist of a bottom-mounted subsurface float equipped with an inertial measurement unit (IMU) and data center that records the float’s motion and attitude as a time series. The flow speed is measured by calculating the tilt angle of the float in response to the current. However, tilt-based measurements require the float system to be carefully engineered and its physical response optimized for good results. Even so, high-frequency flow-induced vibrations often dominate the motion and must be averaged and filtered out of the data and discarded. This represents the loss of potentially valuable information, but decoding the high-frequency components for such useful data is difficult. These experiments explored using an artificial neural network (ANN) approach to extract the ambient water current speed from that high-frequency data alone, after the displacement information was filtered out. The methods were informed by the ANN designs and data augmentation techniques used by neurologists to observe the tremors and other motions exhibited by patients experiencing symptoms of Parkinson’s disease. Once the model was trained using carefully selected training and validation sets to prevent overfitting, the results of evaluating previously unseen data by the model are clear and promising. Water current speed was accurately calculated from the high-frequency components of the motion sensor data and agreed with corresponding current speeds measured by established methods. This novel approach could facilitate new sensor system designs that can be empirically or self-calibrated more efficiently and have a lower barrier to application than those currently available.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacoustics 3aambient water 3aneural networks 3atime series analysis 3awater currents0 tEnvironmental monitoring and assessment.g2022 Feb., v. 194, no. 2 p.129-129dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:jnl33242x0167-63697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-021-09744-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03163naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001600151245012400167300001600291520155900307536027501866592002802141596002902169596001102198596003602209650001302245650001702258650001602275650001402291650001902305651001002324651002002334653001902354653001902373653001302392653001302405700002202418700001802440700001502458700001602473700001702489773010402506856008602610852000902696655001202705IND60788312520221119200536.0220813e20220903xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078831252DNAL7 a10.1080/00318884.2022.20792712doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZeng, Yulan10aMorphology, ultrastructure and phylogeny of Auricula weizhouensis sp. nov. (Bacillariophyceae) from the South China Sea  ap. 484-495.  aA new marine diatom species, Auricula weizhouensis sp. nov., was isolated from Weizhou Island, Guangxi, China, and the morphology was examined in detail. The frustule was symmetrical and quadrate, with four rounded angles. The valve was longitudinally reniform. The vegetative cells of A. weizhouensis were 28.9–35.0 μm in length and 22.2–28.9 μm in width. The mature cingulum was composed of five to six open bands. A large plate-like chloroplast was observed on the ventral side of the girdle. There were 5–7 poroids per 1 μm in a row along the median line. The number of radiate and biforked striae was 15–19 per 10 μm on the ventral margin and 21–31 per 10 μm on the dorsal margin. Striae were biseriate with two rows of areolae (12–14 areolae per 1 μm). Both sides of the double-sigmoid raphe canal had a longitudinal costa. Approximately 21–31 fibulae per 10 μm were arrayed in a row on each longitudinal costa. More importantly, A. weizhouensis and Auricula densestriata could be distinguished from other Auricula species by their characteristic concave ventral margin, and the ventral margin of A. weizhouensis was approximately straight in the middle, whereas that of A. densestriata was inflected. In addition, molecular data from partial SSU rDNA sequences showed that A. weizhouensis (strain WZ-1704-E8) belonged to the genus Auricula, with Auricula complexa (KX120684) as the nearest neighbour (4.58% p-distance). Therefore, both morphological and phylogenetic analyses supported A. weizhouensis as a new species.  aThis work was supported by the Zhejiang Provincial Natural Science Foundation of China [LY19D060007; LY20D060004]; Scientific Research Fund of the Second Institute of Oceanography, MNR [JG2108]; and National Science Foundation of China [41406173; 41876139; 41961144013].  aPublisher supplied data  aLY19D060007; LY20D060004  aJG2108  a41406173; 41876139; 41961144013 3aAuricula 3achloroplasts 3anew species 3aphylogeny 3aultrastructure 3aChina 3aSouth China Sea 0aBenthic diatom 0aFine structure 0aSSU rDNA 0aTaxonomy1 aHemed, Ali Masoud1 aWang, Pengbin1 aGao, Yahui1 aLu, Douding1 aDai, Xinfeng0 tPhycologia.g2022 Sept. 03, v. 61, no. 5 p.484-495dTaylor & FranciswJournal:1959x2330-29687nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00318884.2022.20792713Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02727naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094024002200132024001900154040001800173100001900191245011000210300001600320506007600336520110100412592002801513506003701541650000801578650001601586650001701602650002701619650002101646650001101667650001201678650003101690650002101721650002201742650001101764650001501775653002001790653002101810653001801831653004401849653002901893653001501922700002101937700002101958700001701979773011901996856008502115852000902200655001202209IND60612522720221207094720.0190321e201906  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061252272DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbalip.2018.08.0072doi7 aPMC64334132pmcid7 a309053492pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShin, Myungsun10aLipid-metabolizing serine hydrolases in the mammalian central nervous system: endocannabinoids and beyond  ap. 907-921.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe metabolic serine hydrolases hydrolyze ester, amide, or thioester bonds found in broad small molecule substrates using a conserved activated serine nucleophile. The mammalian central nervous system (CNS) express a diverse repertoire of serine hydrolases that act as (phospho)lipases or lipid amidases to regulate lipid metabolism and signaling vital for normal neurocognitive function and CNS integrity. Advances in genomic DNA sequencing have provided evidence for the role of these lipid-metabolizing serine hydrolases in neurologic, psychiatric, and neurodegenerative disorders. This review briefly summarizes recent progress in understanding the biochemical and (patho)physiological roles of these lipid-metabolizing serine hydrolases in the mammalian CNS with a focus on serine hydrolases involved in the endocannabinoid system. The development and application of specific inhibitors for an individual serine hydrolase, if available, are also described.This article is part of a Special Issue entitled Novel functions of phospholipase A2 Guest Editors: Makoto Murakami and Gerard Lambeau.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDNA 3aLewis bases 3acannabinoids 3acentral nervous system 3alipid metabolism 3alipids 3amammals 3aneurodegenerative diseases 3aphospholipase A2 3asequence analysis 3aserine 3athioesters 0aEndocannabinoid 0aSerine hydrolase 0aPhospholipase 0aActivity-based protein profiling (ABPP) 0a2‑Arachidonoylglycerol 0aAnandamide1 aWare, Timothy B.1 aLee, Hyeon-Cheol1 aHsu, Ku-Lung0 tBiochimica et biophysica acta.g2019 June, v. 1864, no. 6 p.907-921dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12057x1388-19817nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbalip.2018.08.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03307naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131100002100149245015300170300001600323520203500339592002802374650002002402650001202422650002502434650001802459650001302477650002102490650002302511650001902534650001802553650001302571650002102584650001502605650002302620651001802643700002002661700002302681773009902704856008502803852000902888655001202897IND4447575220221121143011.0141112e201102  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444757522DNAL7 a10.1016/j.soilbio.2010.10.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMinick, Kevan J.10aCalcium and phosphorus interact to reduce mid-growing season net nitrogen mineralization potential in organic horizons in a northern hardwood forest  ap. 271-279.  aAcid deposition can deplete soil calcium (Ca) and be detrimental to the health of some forests. We examined effects of soil Ca and phosphorus (P) availability on microbial activity and nitrogen (N) transformations in a plot-scale nutrient addition experiment at the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest in New Hampshire, USA. We tested the hypotheses that (1) microbial activity and N transformations respond to large but not small changes in soil Ca, (2) soil Ca availability influences net N mineralization via the immobilization of N, rather than via changes in microbial activity, and (3) the response to Ca is constrained by P availability. Seasonality was a primary influence on the microbial response to treatments; N cycling processes varied from May to October and treatment effects were only detectable in the mid-growing season, in July. Neither microbial activity (C mineralization) nor gross N mineralization responded to Ca or to P, in either horizon. In the Oa horizon in July net N mineralization was reduced by high Ca and by Ca + P, and gross nitrification was increased by P addition. In the Oe horizon in July net N mineralization was reduced by Ca + P. These results partially supported our hypotheses, suggesting that soil Ca depletion has the potential to increase mid-growing season N availability via subtle changes in N immobilization, and that this effect is sensitive to soil P chemistry. The horizon-specific nature of the responses that we detected suggests that the proportions of Oe and Oa horizons comprising the surface organic layer will influence the relative importance of these processes at the ecosystem scale. Our results highlight the need for further attention to seasonal changes in controls of microbial mineralization/immobilization processes, to functional differences between organic horizons, and to interactions between Ca and P in soils, in order to learn the specific mechanisms underlying the influence of Ca status on nutrient recycling in these northern hardwood ecosystems.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacid deposition 3acalcium 3aexperimental forests 3aforest health 3ahardwood 3ahardwood forests 3amicrobial activity 3amineralization 3anitrification 3anitrogen 3aorganic horizons 3aphosphorus 3aseasonal variation 3aNew Hampshire1 aFisk, Melany C.1 aGroffman, Peter M.0 tSoil biology & biochemistry.g2011 Feb., v. 43, no. 2 p.271-279dElsevier Ltdx0038-07177nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.soilbio.2010.10.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02571naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100002000112245007200132300001600204506002800220520134000248592002801588506003701616650001601653650001301669650001601682650001401698650001501712650001301727650001701740650000901757651001001766653001501776653001101791653001301802653000901815653001101824653001001835700001901845700003401864700002101898773020901919852000902128655001202137IND60739816520221207081534.0210103e202101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073981652DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShrestha, Jiban10aEvaluation of rice genotypes for growth, yield and yield components  ap. 339-346.  aResource is Open Access  aTwelve rice genotypes were evaluated under irrigated lowland and upland rainfed conditions in a randomized complete block design with three replications at Khumaltar, Lalitpur, Nepal in 2019. Data on plant height, panicle length, effective tillers per plant, fertile grain number per panicle and grain yield were taken. The variation was observed for plant height, panicle length, effective tillers per plant, fertile grain number per panicle among the evaluated rice genotypes. The rice genotype NR 11375-B-B-21 produced the highest grain yield (3974.75 kg/ha) followed by NR 11374-B-B-23 (3615.26 kg/ha) and NR 11145-B-B-B-6 (3597.56 kg/ha) under irrigated low land condition. Similarly, the rice genotypes, NR 11375-B-B-21 produced the highest grain yield (3837.15 kg/ha) followed by NR 11321-B-B-7-3 (3588.71 kg/ha) and NR 11305-B-B-1-3 (3292.36 kg/ha) under upland rainfed condition. The combined analysis showed that rice genotype NR 11375-B-B-21 produced the highest grain yield (3905.95 kg/ha) followed by NR 11374-B-B-23 (3494.63 kg/ha), and NR 11321-B-B-7-3 (3409.89 kg/ha) respectively. Thus, after evaluation of yield, two genotypes namely NR 11375-B-B-21, NR 11374-B-B-23, were selected as outstanding genotypes, which can be used as potential breeding materials for upland and low land environments of mid hills of Nepal.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aagriculture 3agenotype 3agrain yield 3ahighlands 3airrigation 3apanicles 3aplant height 3arice 3aNepal 0aevaluation 0agrowth 0alow land 0arice 0aupland 0ayield1 aSubedi, Sudeep1 aKushwaha, Ujjawal Kumar Singh1 aMaharjan, Bidhya0 tJournal of agriculture and natural resources.g2021 Jan., v. 4, no. 2 p.339-346dTribhuvan University, Institute of Agriculture and Animal Science, Prithu Technical CollegewJournal:27916x2661-62897nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle03444naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092040001800130100002200148245012800170300001800298500001500316520206200331592002802393650001502421650002202436650001402458650002102472650001602493650001402509650002202523650001802545650001902563650000902582650001802591650001002609650001002619650001602629650001302645650002202658650001202680650001602692651001402708653001502722700002502737773010702762856008402869852000902953655001202962IND4472848420221120184650.0141111e20111101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447284842DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foreco.2011.07.0322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBogino, Stella M.10aClimate and groundwater effects on the establishment, growth and death of Prosopis caldenia trees in the Pampas (Argentina)  ap. 1766-1774.  a2019-12-06  aSemiarid woodlands dominated by Prosopis caldenia thrive at the dry edge of the Argentinean Pampas. Deforestation and increased precipitation have driven sustained water table level rise in the region that are likely to affect the dynamics of remnant woody vegetation patches. Here we analyze the effect of climate and groundwater level on the establishment, growth and death of P. caldenia located on lowland (current water table <0.5m deep) and upland (current water table 8m deep) positions within rolling sandy landscape. Standard dendrochronological techniques were applied on 98 cross sections and cores of P. caldenia trees. Results allowed us to estimated that trees in the lowland established a few years earlier than in the upland (1929 vs. 1936) and died between 1991 and 2002, while trees in higher positions are still alive. As a result of a faster growth in the lowland, maximum mean basal area increment took place earlier (1950s vs. 1990s) and achieved a higher mean value than in the upland (41.63 vs. 37.41mm²). While mean annual chronologies were not associated across stands, an opposite highly significant association was found for the mean growth trends suggesting long-term effects of water table depths on growth. We found a different association between mean annual growth and climate, with lowland trees showing a negative response to precipitation before and during the growing season, and upland trees displaying a positive response to summer rainfall inputs. Temperature at the end of the growing season had a positive effect in the lowland whereas temperature during the growing season had a positive effect in the upland. These results show how groundwater can induce diverging sensitivity of forest growth and survival to climate variability, enhancing growth at optimum depths (2–8m in our study) but depressing it or even killing trees when it approaches the surface (<2m in our study). Groundwater dynamic should be considered in forest management and conservation strategies in semiarid woodlands in Central Argentina.  aPublisher supplied data 3alandscapes 3along term effects 3awoodlands 3astand basal area 3agroundwater 3ahighlands 3aforest management 3adeforestation 3agrowing season 3arain 3aforest growth 3atrees 3adeath 3atemperature 3alowlands 3aProsopis caldenia 3aclimate 3awater table 3aArgentina 0abasal area1 aJobbágy, Esteban G.0 tForest ecology and management.g2011 Nov. 1, v. 262, no. 9 p.1766-1774dElsevier B.V.x0378-11277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foreco.2011.07.0323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02541naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001900139245018600158300001800344520105000362592002801412650004401440650002201484650001401506650002201520650001601542650001901558650001101577650001601588650001101604650003301615650001301648650001101661650002701672650001401699650001701713700001301730700001401743700001901757700001701776700001701793700001801810700001401828773013301842856007501975852000902050655001202059IND60538226520221118091700.0160815e20140212xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053822652DNAL7 a10.1021/ie403186h2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Yanjuan12aA Green Technology for the Preparation of High Fatty Acid Starch Esters: Solid-Phase Synthesis of Starch Laurate Assisted by Mechanical Activation with Stirring Ball Mill as Reactor  ap. 2114-2120.  aStarch laurate, a kind of high fatty acid starch ester, was directly produced by mechanical activation (MA)-assisted solid-phase synthesis (MASPS) technology with a customized stirring ball mill as reactor. The starch laurates with different degrees of substitution (0.0148–0.0412) were obtained under different reaction conditions. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy confirmed that starch ester had been successfully produced by MASPS attributed to active hydroxy groups induced by MA. X-ray diffractometry and scanning electron microscopy showed that MA and esterification significantly disrupted the morphology and crystal structure of starch. Water absorption of starch was increased by MA but decreased by the introduction of laurate groups. Viscosity of starch was obviously reduced after both the processes of MA pretreatment and MASPS. The successful synthesis of starch laurate without the use of solvent and additives suggested that MASPS was a fast, simple, and green method for the production of high fatty acid starch esters.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aX-ray diffraction 3aadditives 3acrystal structure 3aengineering 3aesterification 3aesters 3afatty acids 3amixing 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asolvents 3astarch 3asustainable technology 3aviscosity 3awater uptake1 aGan, Tao1 aHu, Huayu1 aHuang, Zuqiang1 aHuang, Aimin1 aZhu, Yuanqin1 aFeng, Zhenfei1 aYang, Mei0 tIndustrial & Engineering Chemistry Research.g2014 Feb. 12, v. 53, no. 6 p.2114-2120dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-50457nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fie403186h3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03698naa a2200673 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002600151245016100177300001800338520172900356592002802085650003302113650004102146650001502187650001502202650001102217650001402228650002702242650001002269650004302279650001802322650000902340650002002349650001002369650001202379650001002391650002402401650001602425650001302441650001902454650001102473650001202484653002702496653000802523653000902531653001202540653000902552653000902561653000802570653005802578653000902636653001202645653001502657700001402672700001902686700001702705700001902722700002602741700002702767700002402794773009902818856008602917852000903003655001203012IND60653724420221120131227.0200824e20190823xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065372442DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vaccine.2019.07.0512doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSpitteler, Marcelo A.10aValidation of a high performance liquid chromatography method for quantitation of foot-and-mouth disease virus antigen in vaccines and vaccine manufacturing  ap. 5288-5296.  aFoot-and-mouth disease (FMD) is an infectious viral disease that affects the main meat and dairy production animals, including cattle, sheep, goats and swine. It is readily transmissible and countries where the disease is present suffer harsh international trade restrictions on livestock products and serious economic losses. Vaccines are important tools to contain outbreaks and maintain the status of free with or without vaccination, as defined by the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE). The efficacy of vaccines is reliant on the content and integrity of inactivated virus particles. The long-established method to quantify the viral content of vaccines along the manufacturing process and in the final product is the 140S sucrose density gradient analysis. This method has been a valuable tool for many decades. However, it requires gradient preparation for each sample, a lengthy ultracentrifugation and a manual UV reading of the gradient, rendering it highly operator dependent and almost impossible to automate. We present a method to quantify FMDV particles in vaccines and intermediate process samples that is based on separation of components by size exclusion high performance liquid chromatography (SE-HPLC) and measurement of virus by absorption at 254 nm. The method has been extensively validated; it is accurate, precise and linear. It is applicable to all FMDV strains and sample materials and has a good concordance with the 140S test. The proposed method uses off the shelf HPLC equipment and columns. It is easily automated for high throughput operation, affording a useful process analytical technology and a novel tool for control of final product by manufacturers and regulatory agencies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFoot-and-mouth disease virus 3aWorld Organization for Animal Health 3aabsorption 3aautomation 3acattle 3aequipment 3afoot-and-mouth disease 3agoats 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3amanufacturing 3ameat 3amilk production 3asheep 3asucrose 3aswine 3aultracentrifugation 3avaccination 3avaccines 3aviral antigens 3avirion 3aviruses 0aFoot-and-mouth-disease 0aFMD 0aFMDV 0aVaccine 0a140S 0a146S 0aGPC 0aSize exclusion high performance liquid chromatography 0aHPLC 0aSE-HPLC 0aValidation1 aRomo, Ana1 aMagi, Nicolás1 aSeo, Min-Goo1 aYun, Seon-Jong1 aBarroumeres, Fernando1 aRégulier, Emmanuel G.1 aBellinzoni, Rodolfo0 tVaccine.g2019 Aug. 23, v. 37, no. 36 p.5288-5296dElsevier LtdwJournal:6210x0264-410X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2019.07.0513Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02507naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245009000127300001800217500002800235520139200263650001601655650003201671650001801703650001001721650003701731650002101768650001101789650001301800650001201813650001401825650001301839650002101852650001001873700001701883700001201900700001901912700002301931700002701954773008401981852000902065946001102074655001202085IND4412543220221117205315.0081114s2008    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441254322DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKim, Sanghee10aTwo Cap-Binding Proteins CBP20 and CBP80 are Involved in Processing Primary MicroRNAs  ap. 1634-1644.  aPublisher supplied data  aMicroRNAs (miRNAs) are 21 nt RNAs that regulate many biological processes in plants by mediating translational inhibition or cleavage of target transcripts. Arabidopsis mutants defective in miRNA biogenesis have overlapping and highly pleiotropic phenotypes including serrated leaves and ABA hypersensitivity. Recent evidence indicates that miRNA genes are transcribed by RNA polymerase II (Pol II). Since Pol II transcripts are capped, we hypothesized that CBP (cap-binding protein) 20 and 80 may bind to capped primary miRNA (pri-miRNA) transcripts and play a role in their processing. Here, we show that cbp20 and cbp80 mutants have reduced miRNA levels and increased pri-miRNA levels. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments revealed that pri-miRNAs 159, 166, 168 and 172 could be associated with CBP20 and CBP80. We found that CBP20 and CBP80 are stabilized by ABA by a post-translational mechanism, and these proteins are needed for ABA induction of miR159 during seed germination. The lack of miR159 accumulation in ABA-treated seeds of cbp20/80 mutants leads to increased MYB33 and MYB101 transcript levels, and presumably higher levels of these positive regulators result in ABA hypersensitivity. Genetic and molecular analyses show that CBP20 and 80 have overlapping function in the same developmental pathway as SE and HYL1. Our results identify new components in miRNA biogenesis. 3aArabidopsis 3aDNA-directed RNA polymerase 3aabscisic acid 3agenes 3agenetic techniques and protocols 3ahypersensitivity 3aleaves 3amicroRNA 3amutants 3aphenotype 3aproteins 3aseed germination 3aseeds1 aYang, Jun-Yi1 aXu, Jun1 aJang, In-Cheol1 aPrigge, Michael J.1 aChua, N.-H.q(Nam-Hai)0 tPlant & cell physiology.g2008 Nov., v. 49, no. 11 p.1634-1644x0032-07817nnas  aDNAL  aNon-US 7aarticle01535naa a2200301 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002100110245005300131300001600184520072800200650002000928650002000948650002400968650002300992651001301015653001201028653001101040653002201051700001801073773007501091852000901166939003301175946001301208655001201221IND8903561720221117204834.0890705e198812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND890356172DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCoughenour, C.M.10aRewards, values, and satisfaction with farm work  ap. 442-459.  aAlthough the quality of farm work has been an issue for more than a century, quantitative measurement and analysis have been rare. Our review of job-satisfaction studies leads to the hypothesis that satisfaction with farming is the product of farming rewards and values. We develop both additive and multiplicative forms of fulfillment model for relationships with farm-work satisfaction. Items that measure farm rewards, values, and satisfaction were adapted from previous survey research, and data were obtained in a 1982 state survey of Kentucky farmers. Our findings indicate that satisfaction with farming is high and that farmers with nonfarm jobs usually are more satisfied with farming than with their nonfarm jobs. 3aquality of life 3afarming systems 3aoff-farm employment 3afarmers' attitudes 3aKentucky 0arewards 0avalues 0awork satisfaction1 aSwanson, L.E.0 tRural sociology.g1988 Winter, v. 53, no. 4 p.442-459x0036-01127nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle01372naa a2200313 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100001400115245011200129520040100241650001200642650001300654650001500667651000900682653002100691655002700712700001700739700001400756700001400770700001700784773018200801852000900983939003300992945000801025946001301033655001201046991619781070742620221117204705.0840718s1982    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aPAR840044762DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKanda, T.10aSystematics and cytogenetics of the hyrcanus group, leucosphyrus group and Pyrethophorus group in east Asia  aAnopheles mosquitoes of hyrcanus group, leucosphyrus group, and Pyrethophorus group (malaria and filariasis vectors and related species), phylogenetic investigations using hybridization, cytogenetic observations, morphological observations, and separation of protein components by 2-dimensional electrophoretic techniques on populations from different parts of their geographical range: east Asia 3amalaria 3aNematoda 3afilariasis 3aAsia 0aVectors, Insecta 7aconference publication1 aCheong, W.H.1 aOguma, Y.1 aTakai, K.1 aChiang, G.L.0 tRecent developments in the genetics of insect disease vectors : a symposium proceedings / edited by W.W.M.

The patterns of insect abundance on trees have never been satisfactorily described by a numerical model despite considerable knowledge of endogenous and exogenous factors in the population dynamics of the species. Long-term field population estimates of the aphid on foliage provided the opportunity to evaluate such a model. Unlike comparable models for tree-dwelling aphids, this was also applicable to almost completely independent aphid field data derived from the Rothamsted Insect Survey's nationwide network of suction traps. Although based on relatively few parameters, the model was robust in its predictions of alate aphids geographically remote from the forest in which the original population was estimated. The population maximum, which causes the greatest forest damage, is reached in early summer and can be predicted from knowledge of winter temperature (chill bouts), spring temperature (thermal sum), and interannual negative feedback (density dependence). The model provides confirmation that alate populations of spruce aphids, upon which a number of other extensive studies have been based, are ultimately influenced by similar endogenous and climatic factors and that they are a reasonable proxy for aphids on trees. 3aElatobium abietinum 3aPicea 3aclimatic factors 3adefoliation 3aforest damage 3aforests 3ainsects 3aleaves 3amathematical models 3apopulation dynamics 3aspring 3asuction traps 3asummer 3asurveys 3atemperature 3atrees1 aAyres, Matthew P.1 aHarrington, Richard1 aKidd, Neil A.

However, neither the identities of early colonizers nor the temporal changes in surface assemblages are well understood. To determine the identities of the most common bacterial primary colonizers and to assess the succession process, if any, of the bacterial assemblages during early stages of surface colonization in coastal water of the West Pacific Ocean, nonnutritive inert materials (glass, Plexiglas, and polyvinyl chloride) were employed as test surfaces and incubated in seawater off the Qingdao coast in the spring of 2005 for 24 and 72 h. Phylogenetic analysis of the 16S rRNA gene sequences amplified from the recovered surface-colonizing microbiota indicated that diverse bacteria colonized the submerged surfaces. Multivariate statistical cluster analyses indicated that the succession of early surface-colonizing bacterial assemblages followed sequential steps on all types of test surfaces. The Rhodobacterales, especially the marine Roseobacter clade members, formed the most common and dominant primary surface-colonizing bacterial group. Our current data, along with previous studies of the Atlantic coast, indicate that the Rhodobacterales bacteria are the dominant and ubiquitous primary surface colonizers in temperate coastal waters of the world and that microbial surface colonization follows a succession sequence. A conceptual model is proposed based on these findings, which may have important implications for understanding the structure, dynamics, and function of marine biofilms and for developing strategies to harness or control surface-associated microbial communities.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3atemporal variation 3abacterial colonization 3aribosomal RNA 3abiofilm 3amicrobial communities 3apoly(vinyl chloride) 3aRoseobacter 3aglass 3aaquatic environment 3aphylogeny 3aspring 3aseawater 3anucleotide sequences 3acoasts 3astatistical analysis 3acoastal water 3abacteria 3aPacific Ocean 0aadaptation1 aLi, Tiegang1 aChen, Mingna1 aHuang, Guiqiao0 tApplied and environmental microbiology.g2008 Jan. 1, v. 74, no. 1 p.52-60dAmerican Society for Microbiologyx0099-22407nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1128/AEM.01400-073Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://aem.asm.org/contents-by-date.0.shtml 7aarticle03165naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111072000900129100001600138245011900154300001800273500002400291520112900315650002301444650001101467650001801478650002101496650001401517650002501531650001301556650001601569650001501585650002701600650005101627650005101678650005201729650001201781650002901793650005401822650002501876650008001901650002801981650006702009650005102076650005402127650003402181700001602215700001502231700001802246700001502264773012302279852000902402856009302411930003302504945002502537946001302562655001202575IND4379016520221117204452.0060323e200510  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437901652DNAL7 a161958462pmid  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF6001 aGuhling, O.10aSurface composition of myrmecophilic plants: cuticular wax and glandular trichomes on leaves of Macaranga tanarius  ap. 2323-2341.  aIncludes references  aPrimary plant surfaces, covered with cuticles consisting of cutin and waxes, are important substrates for interaction with insects. The composition of leaf surfaces of the myrmecophilic plant Macaranga tanarius was studied. The prenylated flavanone nymphaeol-C was identified in surface extracts and was localized exclusively in glandular trichomes on the abaxial leaf side. The epidermal pavement cells surrounding these trichomes were covered with a smooth film of epicuticular wax from which few small wax crystals protruded. The epicuticular wax amounted to approximately 8 microgram cm(-2), corresponding to 85% of the wax load on the adaxial as well as the abaxial leaf sides. The epicuticular wax mixtures from both leaf surfaces contained more than 70% primary alcohols, 14% fatty acids, 2% aldehydes, and traces of alkyl acetates, with chain lengths ranging from C20 to C38. In contrast, the intracuticular wax layer was largely dominated by triterpenoid alcohols a-amyrin, beta-amyrin, and lupeol. Consequently, these characteristic compounds are not available for direct contact with insects on the plant surface. 3aMacaranga tanarius 3aleaves 3aplant cuticle 3aepicuticular wax 3atrichomes 3achemical composition 3aalcohols 3aisoprenoids 3aflavonoids 3aplant-insect relations 2aAcetatesxchemistryxisolation & purification. 2aAlcoholsxchemistryxisolation & purification. 2aAldehydesxchemistryxisolation & purification. 2aAnimals 2aEuphorbiaceaexchemistry 2aFatty Acidsxchemistryxisolation & purification. 2aInsectaxphysiology. 2aOleanolic Acidxanalogs & derivativesxchemistryxisolation & purification. 2aPentacyclic Triterpenes 2aPlant Leavesxchemistryxgrowth & developmentxultrastructure. 2aTerpenesxchemistryxisolation & purification. 2aTriterpenesxchemistryxisolation & purification. 2aWaxesxchemistryxmetabolism.1 aKinzler, C.1 aDreyer, M.1 aBringmann, G.1 aJetter, R.0 tJournal of chemical ecology.g2005 Oct., v. 31, no. 10 p.2323-2341dKluwer Academic/Plenum Publishersx0098-03317nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.kluweronline.com/issn/0098-0331/contents3Available from publisher's Web site  a20080205b20080301c00000000  aINDdLDPe2006/07/13  aOther US 7aarticle03351naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146072000900164072000900173072000900182100002100191245010400212300001600316500002400332520179000356650001602146650001102162650002202173650001602195650001502211650002102226650001502247650002502262650001202287650001202299650001402311650002602325650003302351650002302384650002302407650002402430650001902454651002102473651002102494700001602515700001702531773008602548852000902634856008502643930003302728945002502761946001102786655001202797IND4379022020221117204718.0060323e200509  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437902202DNAL7 a160012232pmid7 a10.1007/s00442-005-0144-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aM310 0aF820 0aM0011 aCeccarelli, D.M.10aForagers versus farmers: contrasting effects of two behavioural groups of herbivores on coral reefs  ap. 445-453.  aIncludes references  aHerbivorous fishes have been attributed a central role in structuring benthic communities on coral reefs. However, the relative importance of different behavioural groups of herbivores may differ and their interactions may be complex. This study focuses on an experiment that discriminates between two groups of herbivorous fish: (1) “Foragers” (relatively mobile, schooling grazers, including parrotfishes and surgeonfishes) and (2) “Farmers” (highly site-attached, territorial species, primarily damselfishes). Preliminary observations at Kimbe Bay (Papua New Guinea) showed that both groups were common, and that farmers defended areas from foragers and maintained algal communities that were distinct from the surrounding undefended substratum. An orthogonal combination of a farmer removal treatment and a forager exclusion treatment was applied to isolate their separate effects on algae and corals, and to determine whether farmer territory composition results from forager exclusion or algal cultivation. The experiment showed that foragers had quantitatively greater and qualitatively different effects on sessile benthic community structure than farmers. Where foragers were excluded, there were substantial increases in the cover and biomass of macro-algae and a decline in some corals, regardless of the presence of farmers. Where farmers were removed there was a moderate decline in the cover of some food algal species, regardless of whether foragers had access. No effect of the exclusion of foragers by farmers could be detected. Our results support prevailing views that foragers have a major impact on coral reefs and farmers cultivate selected algae, but challenge the hypothesis that damselfish influence habitat structure by moderating forager disturbance. 3acoral reefs 3acorals 3abenthic organisms 3amarine fish 3aherbivores 3afeeding behavior 3amacroalgae 2aAnalysis of Variance 2aAnimals 2aBiomass 2aEcosystem 2aEukaryotaxphysiology 2aFeeding Behaviorxphysiology 2aFishesxphysiology 2aPopulation Density 2aSpecies Specificity 2aTerritoriality 3aPapua New Guinea 0aPapua New Guinea1 aJones, G.P.1 aMcCook, L.J.0 tOecologia.g2005 Sept., v. 145, no. 3 p.445-453dSpringer-Verlagx0029-85497nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00442-005-0144-y3Available from publisher's Web site  a20120525b20120604c00000000  aINDdGAYe2006/04/03  aNon-US 7aarticle03244naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146072000900164072000900173072000900182072000900191100002100200245010700221300001600328500002400344520156000368650001901928650001301947650001601960650002201976650002301998650001402021650002402035650002202059650002602081650001202107650001402119650001602133650001602149650002802165650002302193650002402216650002902240650001602269651002202285651001202307653002102319700001602340700002002356700001702376773008602393852000902479856008502488930003302573945002502606946001102631655001202642IND4379021320221117204702.0060323e200509  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437902132DNAL7 a160416152pmid7 a10.1007/s00442-005-0150-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aM310 0aL600 0aM001 0aL2101 aRuttenberg, B.I.10aPatterns, causes and consequences of regional variation in the ecology and life history of a reef fish  ap. 394-403.  aIncludes references  aMany species vary in their ecology across their geographic ranges in response to gradients in environmental conditions. Such variation, which can influence life history traits and subsequent demography of populations, usually occurs over large spatial scales. However, describing and understanding the causes of such variation is difficult precisely because it occurs over such large spatial scales. In this study, we document spatial variation in the ecology of a common reef fish, Stegastes beebei, in the Galápagos Islands and test a number of potential causal mechanisms. The pattern resembles that seen in latitudinal variation: individuals are larger, occur in higher densities, and live longer in the coldest region of the islands than those in the warmest region. However, in this system, demography varies among regional populations separated by <150 km. Preferred nutritious algae are more available in the cold region and comprise a greater proportion of the diet of fish in this region. Per gram reproductive effort appears to be strongly related to temperature, despite differences in the gross magnitude and timing of reproduction in different regions. A model of reproductive output suggests that fish in the warmest region are allocating a greater proportion of available energy to reproduction, resulting in apparent regional life history tradeoffs. Our data suggest that regional demographic differences in S. beebei may be driven by a combination of variation in food availability and an environmentally mediated life history tradeoff. 3aanimal ecology 3alatitude 3amarine fish 3aspatial variation 3apopulation density 3alongevity 3aanimal reproduction 3awater temperature 3anutrient availability 2aAnimals 2aBody Size 2aEnvironment 2aObservation 2aPerciformesxphysiology 2aPopulation Density 2aRegression Analysis 2aReproductionxphysiology 2aTemperature 3aGalapagos Islands 0aEcuador 0aStegastes beebei1 aHaupt, A.J.1 aChiriboga, A.I.1 aWarner, R.R.0 tOecologia.g2005 Sept., v. 145, no. 3 p.394-403dSpringer-Verlagx0029-85497nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00442-005-0150-03Available from publisher's Web site  a20120525b20120604c00000000  aINDdGAYe2006/04/03  aNon-US 7aarticle02239naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002900152245015600181300001800337500002400355520094800379650002601327650001401353650001801367650002301385650002001408650001401428650001001442650001401452650002001466650001301486650001301499650001701512700002601529700002701555700003001582700001901612700002101631773010101652852000901753856005501762655001201817IND4444951320221117204635.0101105s2010    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444495132DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-2109.2010.02530.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAbdel Rahman, Soliman H.10aPartial substitution of dietary fish meal with soybean meal for speckled shrimp, Metapenaeus monoceros (Fabricius, 1798) (Decapoda: Penaeidae) juvenile  ap. e299-e306.  aIncludes references  aA 63‐day feeding study was conducted to evaluate the effect of partial substitution (0%, 20%, 40% and 60%) of dietary fish meal (FM) with soybean meal (SBM) on the growth performance and feed utilization of speckled shrimp, Metapenaeus monoceros juveniles. A total of 180 M. monoceros juveniles with an average weight of 0.67 ± 0.18 g were equally distributed over 12 glass aquaria (30 L each, triplicate per treatment). All aquaria were filled with filtered sea water (30-35 ‰, salinity). Four isonitrogenous (400 g kg⁻¹ crude protein) and isocaloric (20.5 MJ GE kg⁻¹) test diets were formulated. The control diet contained FM (D₁) as the main protein source. In the other diets, FM was partially replaced with 20 (D₂), 40% (D₃) or 60% (D₄) SBM. The results indicate that the diet in which 40% of the FM is replaced by SBM yields similar growth and production, and is as cost effective, as the control diet. 3aMetapenaeus monoceros 3aaquariums 3acrude protein 3aexperimental diets 3afeed conversion 3afish meal 3aglass 3ajuveniles 3aprotein sources 3asalinity 3aseawater 3asoybean meal1 aAbdel Razek, Fatma A.1 aGoda, Ashraf M.A. ‐S1 aGhobashy, Abdel Fattah A.1 aTaha, Somia M.1 aKhafagy, Amal R.0 tAquaculture research.g2010, v. 41, no. 9 p.e299-e306dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx1355-557X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2109.2010.02530.x 7aarticle02865naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100002000184245004900204300002000253506007600273520108900349506003701438650001501475650001001490650001301500650002001513650002001533650002401553650002401577650000901601650001201610650001301622650001401635650001901649650003201668650001301700650001301713700001901726700001901745700001601764700001901780700001601799700002101815700002201836700001701858700001701875700004701892700002201939773017601961852000902137856008302146930003302229946001302262655001202275IND4409083920221207120207.0080815e20080812xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440908392DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.08041571052doi7 aPMC25162242pmcid7 a186850872pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGrünewald, Jan10aImmunochemical termination of self-tolerance  ap. 11276-11280.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe ability to selectively induce a strong immune response against self-proteins, or increase the immunogenicity of specific epitopes in foreign antigens, would have a significant impact on the production of vaccines for cancer, protein-misfolding diseases, and infectious diseases. Here, we show that site-specific incorporation of an immunogenic unnatural amino acid into a protein of interest produces high-titer antibodies that cross-react with WT protein. Specifically, mutation of a single tyrosine residue (Tyr⁸⁶) of murine tumor necrosis factor-α (mTNF-α) to p-nitrophenylalanine (pNO₂Phe) induced a high-titer antibody response in mice, whereas no significant antibody response was observed for a Tyr⁸⁶ [rightward arrow] Phe mutant. The antibodies generated against the pNO₂Phe are highly cross-reactive with native mTNF-α and protect mice against lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced death. This approach may provide a general method for inducing an antibody response to specific epitopes of self- and foreign antigens that lead to a neutralizing immune response.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aantibodies 3adeath 3aepitopes 3aimmune response 3aimmunochemistry 3ainfectious diseases 3alipopolysaccharides 3amice 3amutants 3amutation 3aneoplasms 3aneutralization 3atumor necrosis factor-alpha 3atyrosine 3avaccines1 aTsao, Meng-Lin1 aPerera, Roshan1 aDong, Liqun1 aNiessen, Frank1 aWen, Ben G.1 aKubitz, Diane M.1 aSmider, Vaughn V.1 aRuf, Wolfram1 aNasoff, Marc1 aLerner, Richard A.q(Richard Alan),d1938-1 aSchultz, Peter G.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2008 Aug. 12, v. 105, no. 32 p.11276-11280dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.08041571053Available from publisher's Web site  a20080815b20080905c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02563naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002500092040001800117100002000135245010600155300001600261500002400277520138700301650002001688650001201708650002301720650001301743650002601756650002601782650001701808650002201825650001301847650002501860650002101885650001101906650000901917650002501926651001301951700001901964700001801983773009302001852000902094856003802103655001202141IND4460465320221117205205.0110729s2011    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446046532DNAL7 a10.1071/CP110942doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPembleton, K.G.10aYield and water-use efficiency of contrasting lucerne genotypes grown in a cool temperate environment  ap. 610-623.  aIncludes references  aIn Tasmania, Australia, forage production is maximised by the use of irrigation. However, availability of water for irrigation is often limited, making the water-use efficiency (WUE) of a species/genotype an important consideration when designing forage systems. Field experimentation and an associated modelling study was undertaken to determine the WUE and environmental factors influencing WUE for contrasting lucerne (Medicago sativa) genotypes across six dairying regions within Tasmania. In the field experiment a significant genotype influence on WUE was identified under irrigated conditions and modelling identified a genotype influence on WUE in three out of six regions. WUE was related to the amount of water received (irrigation plus rainfall). The marginal response to the application of irrigation water (MWUE) was greatest for the highly winter-active genotype in the field experiment; however, modelling did not identify a consistent genotype influence on MWUE across regions. MWUE was negatively associated with the amount of deep drainage. The present study identified that lucerne has the potential to improve the WUE of forage systems across six different Tasmanian regions. The linkage of MWUE and deep drainage highlights that deficit irrigation practices could further improve the WUE of this forage crop, particularly in environments prone to deep drainage. 3aMedicago sativa 3aalfalfa 3adeficit irrigation 3adrainage 3aenvironmental factors 3afield experimentation 3aforage crops 3aforage production 3agenotype 3airrigated conditions 3airrigation water 3amodels 3arain 3awater use efficiency 3aTasmania1 aRawnsley, R.P.1 aDonaghy, D.J.0 tCrop & pasture science.g2011, v. 62, no. 7 p.610-623dCSIRO Publishingx1836-09477nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1071/CP11094 7aarticle02380naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100003200145245011100177300001400288500002400302520117000326650001601496650002101512650002801533650002001561650002001581650001201601650001201613650002101625650001701646650001601663650001301679650001601692700002801708700001901736700002701755700002801782773010301810852000901913856004801922655001201970IND4398954820221117204602.0071216e200802  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439895482DNAL7 a10.1007/s10482-007-9179-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMora-Montes, Hector Manuel.10aConversion of α1,2-mannosidase E-I from Candida albicans to α1,2-mannosidase E-II by limited proteolysis  ap. 61-69.  aIncludes references  aPrevious studies demonstrated the presence in Candida albicans ATCC 26555 of two soluble α1,2-mannosidases: E-I and E-II. In contrast, in the C. albicans CAI-4 mutant only E-I was detected and it could be processed by a membrane-bound proteolytic activity from the ATCC 26555 strain, generating an active 43 kDa polypeptide. Here, α1,2-mannosidase E-I from strain ATCC 26555 was purified by conventional methods of protein isolation and affinity chromatography in Concanavalin A-Sepharose 4B. Analytical electrophoresis of the purified enzyme revealed two polypeptides of 52 and 23 kDa, the former being responsible for enzyme activity as revealed by zymogram analysis. Time course proteolysis with an aspartyl protease from Aspergillus saitoi, converted α1,2-mannosidase E-I into an active polypeptide of 43 kDa which trimmed Man₉GlcNAc₂, generating Man₈GlcNAc₂ isomer B and mannose. Trimming was inhibited preferentially by 1-deoxymannojirimycin. Both, the molecular mass and the enzyme properties of the proteolytic product were identical to those described for α1,2-mannosidase E-II therefore supporting the notion that E-I is the precursor of E-II. 3aAspergillus 3aCandida albicans 3aaffinity chromatography 3aelectrophoresis 3aenzyme activity 3aisomers 3amannose 3amolecular weight 3apolypeptides 3aproteinases 3aproteins 3aproteolysis1 aLópez-Romero, Everardo1 aZinker, Samuel1 aPonce-Noyola, Patricia1 aFlores-Carreón, Arturo0 tAntonie van Leeuwenhoek.g2008 Feb., v. 93, no. 1-2 p.61-69dSpringer Netherlandsx0003-60727nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10482-007-9179-x 7aarticle02721naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002100110245005500131300001400186520159500200650001901795650001501814650002401829650001801853650000701871650002301878650001901901650001701920653002901937653001601966653001501982653003001997653002502027653003602052653003202088653002802120700001702148773009102165852000902256939003302265946001302298655001202311IND8903764320221117204601.0890714e198801  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND890376432DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchulthess, C.P.12aA critical assessment of surface adsorption models  ap. 92-97.  aThe theory on variable ionization energy of surface sites is criticized based on inconsistencies of traditional potentiometric titration data (singluar reference curve methods) with electrophoretic mobility (EM) data, and on the nature of dissolution of the solid phase. The mathematical consequences of including the Boltzmann distribution term in models using intrinsic equilibrium constants are most probably merely to track the solubility behavior of the solid phase. The EM of an Al oxide was studied with respect to pH. The isotherm showed clear maximum mobility at low and high pH values with the zero point of charge (ZPC) ranging from pH 9.5 to 9.8. The ZPC lowers with increasing electrolyte concentration due to the increased competitive behavior of the cations in solution for the surface sites. Assuming a constant ionization energy of the surface sites, a mass balanced model that predicted both anion-cation adsorption data and potentiometric titration data (backtitration technique) also correlated well with the EM data. The EM behavior was modeled based on the varying mobility of each type of surface species present on the oxide at various pH values. Whereas traditional models treat the oxide as being capable of forming a surface charge that induces ion adsorption, this model treats the oxide as being capable of undergoing ion exchange or substitution reactions resulting in surfaces that exhibit mobility in an applied electric field. The proposed model assumes that anion adsorption results in positive mobility, and cation adsorption results in negative mobility. 3asoil chemistry 3aadsorption 3amathematical models 3adata analysis 3apH 3asorption isotherms 3aaluminum oxide 3aion exchange 0aelectrokinetic potential 0aequilibrium 0aassessment 0apoint of zero salt effect 0azero point of charge 0aintrinsic equilibrium constants 0aboltzmann distribution term 0asolid phase dissolution1 aSparks, D.L.0 tSoil Science Society of America journal.g1988 , v. 52, no. 1 p.92-97x0361-59957nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02887naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024004200133040001800175100002500193245006700218300001800285500002400303500001500327506007600342520117000418506003701588650001601625650001401641650001401655650001401669650001901683650001701702650001201719650001101731650001401742650001301756650001001769650001201779650002301791650001701814650002501831650001201856650001801868650002001886650002301906650002701929650001401956650004901970650002302019651001402042653001002056700002302066700001902089773011302108852000902221856005502230655001202285IND4408684820221207103916.0080808e200809  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440868482DNAL7 a184794402pmid7 aPMC27025032pmcid7 a10.1111/j.1462-2920.2008.01652.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMarhaver, Kristen L.10aViral communities associated with healthy and bleaching corals  ap. 2277-2286.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe coral holobiont is the integrated assemblage of the coral animal, its symbiotic algae, protists, fungi and a diverse consortium of Bacteria and Archaea. Corals are a model system for the study of symbiosis, the breakdown of which can result in disease and mortality. Little is known, however, about viruses that infect corals and their symbionts. Here we present metagenomic analyses of the viral communities associated with healthy and partially bleached specimens of the Caribbean reef-building coral Diploria strigosa. Surprisingly, herpes-like sequences accounted for 4-8% of the total sequences in each metagenome; this abundance of herpes-like sequences is unprecedented in other marine viral metagenomes. Viruses similar to those that infect algae and plants were also present in the coral viral assemblage. Among the phage identified, cyanophages were abundant in both healthy and bleaching corals and vibriophages were also present. Therefore, coral-associated viruses could potentially infect all components of the holobiont - coral, algal and microbial. Thus, we expect viruses to figure prominently in the preservation and breakdown of coral health.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3acoral reefs 3asymbiosis 3ableaching 3asymbionts 3abacteriophages 3ametagenomics 3aArchaea 3acorals 3amortality 3abacteria 3afungi 2aAnimals 2aAnthozoaxvirology 2aBiodiversity 2aDNA, Viralxgenetics 2aEcology 2aGenome, Viral 2aGenomic Library 2aSequence Alignment 2aSequence Analysis, DNA 2aSymbiosis 2aVirusesxgeneticsxisolation & purification. 2aWater Microbiology 3aCaribbean 0aAlgae1 aEdwards, Robert A.1 aRohwer, Forest0 tEnvironmental microbiology.g2008 Sept., v. 10, no. 9 p.2277-2286dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx1462-29127nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1462-2920.2008.01652.x 7aarticle02886naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100001900171245006800190300001400258500002400272520129800296650001201594650002001606650002001626650001001646650001001656650002201666650002301688650001801711650002101729650002401750650001201774650001301786650001101799650002001810650003001830650001001860650003101870650000901901650003101910650004201941700001701983700002002000700001802020700002202038700001802060700001702078700001602095700002302111773012202134852000902256856005502265655001202320IND4447941720221117205036.0110125e201102  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444794172DNAL7 a212146412pmid7 a10.1111/j.1439-0388.2010.00887.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSerão, N.V.L.10aCandidate gene expression and intramuscular fat content in pigs  ap. 28-34.  aIncludes references  aSeventy-two pigs of three genetic groups (Brazilian indigenous breed Piau, Commercial line and Crossbred) of both sexes were slaughtered at four live weights (30, 60, 90 and 120 kg). Intramuscular fat (IMF) content in Longissimus dorsi muscle of each animal was extracted and correlated with candidate gene mRNA expression (ATN1, EEF1A2, FABP3, LDLR, MGP, OBSCN, PDHB, TRDN and RYR1). Within slaughter weight of 120 kg, Piau and Crossbred pigs showed higher IMF content (p < 0.05) than commercial animals, with 2.48, 2.08 and 1.00% respectively.

Gene expression of EEF1A2, FABP3, LDLR, OBSCN, PDHB, TRDN and RYR1 were correlated with IMF (p < 0.05) using the whole dataset. For Piau data only, expression of FABP3, LDLR, MGP, OBSCN, PDHB, TRDN and RYR1 showed correlation with IMF (p < 0.05). Genes that have important roles in lipid transportation inside the cell (FABP3) and tissues (LDLR) showed correlation with IMF of, respectively, 0.68 and 0.63 using the whole data set, and 0.90 and 0.91 using data from Piau animals. The highly positive correlation of the LDLR and FAPB3 expression with IMF content may confirm that these genes are important for fat deposition in the porcine L. dorsi muscle. 3abarrows 3adata collection 3agene expression 3agenes 3agilts 3aintramuscular fat 3alongissimus muscle 3amessenger RNA 3aslaughter weight 2aAdiposityxgenetics 2aAnimals 2aBreeding 2aFemale 2aGene Expression 2aGene Expression Profiling 2aGenes 2aLipid Metabolismxgenetics 2aMale 2aRNA, Messengerxmetabolism 2aSwinexanatomy & histologyxgenetics.1 aVeroneze, R.1 aRibeiro, A.M.F.1 aVerardo, L.L.1 aBraccini Neto, J.1 aGasparino, E.1 aCampos, C.F.1 aLopes, P.S.1 aGuimarães, S.E.F.0 tJournal of animal breeding and genetics.g2011 Feb., v. 128, no. 1 p.28-34dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0931-26687nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1439-0388.2010.00887.x 7aarticle02459naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002200145245007600167300001800243500002400261520147200285650001701757650001601774650001001790650001201800650001701812650001001829650001501839651001401854700001601868700001701884700002201901700001801923773009901941852000902040856004802049655001202097IND4414630820221117205059.0090105e200811  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441463082DNAL7 a10.1007/s10980-008-9265-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLaCroix, Jacob J.10aEdge effects on fire spread in a disturbed Northern Wisconsin landscape  ap. 1081-1092.  aIncludes references  aThe effect of area-of-edge influence (AEI) on fire size and movement was simulated by considering the distribution of single and multiple edges in the Chequamegon-Nicolet National Forest in Northern Wisconsin, USA. Six hypothetical landscapes with different delineations of AEIs were created for simulating fire spread using FARSITE to evaluate the influence of edges on the rate and direction of fire spread. The burned area differed significantly among the six landscapes. In the three scenarios with buffered edges, the burned area increased by 35% with high loading fuel in AEIs, while it decreased by 21 and 46% with medium and low fuel loading in the AEIs, respectively, as compared to the no edge scenario. In two scenarios we delineated the area-of-multiple-edge influence (AMEI) and placed more than one high loading fuel within it. This increased the burned area by 5% from the high buffered edge scenario and by 40% from the control. When the depth-of-edge influence (DEI) was doubled to 60 m using AMEI with high fuels, the burned area increased by 20% from the high buffered edge scenario and by 60% from the control. We found that low and medium fuel loading slowed the fire spread and over time, caused the fire front to change direction. In high fuel loading scenarios, AEIs acted as corridors facilitating the fire spread by providing a contiguous patch of fuel which allowed fires to increase in size and pulled the fire front in the same direction. 3aedge effects 3afire spread 3afires 3aforests 3afuel loading 3afuels 3alandscapes 3aWisconsin1 aLi, Qinglin1 aChen, Jiquan1 aHenderson, Rachel1 aJohn, Ranjeet0 tLandscape ecology.g2008 Nov., v. 23, no. 9 p.1081-1092dSpringer Netherlandsx0921-29737nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10980-008-9265-0 7aarticle02910naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100002600184245004100210300002000251506007600271520143200347506003701779650001701816650001601833650001801849650002401867650001101891650002601902650001301928650001901941650001401960650001101974650002301985650002602008700002102034700002302055700002402078700002402102773017602126852000902302856008302311930003302394946001302427655001202440IND4409616020221207120125.0080829e20080826xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440961602DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.08019881052doi7 aPMC25278842pmcid7 a187191202pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPhillips, Jennifer E.10aEngineering graded tissue interfaces  ap. 12170-12175.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aInterfacial zones between tissues provide specialized, transitional junctions central to normal tissue function. Regenerative medicine strategies focused on multiple cell types and/or bi/tri-layered scaffolds do not provide continuously graded interfaces, severely limiting the integration and biological performance of engineered tissue substitutes. Inspired by the bone-soft tissue interface, we describe a biomaterial-mediated gene transfer strategy for spatially regulated genetic modification and differentiation of primary dermal fibroblasts within tissue-engineered constructs. We demonstrate that zonal organization of osteoblastic and fibroblastic cellular phenotypes can be engineered by a simple, one-step seeding of fibroblasts onto scaffolds containing a spatial distribution of retrovirus encoding the osteogenic transcription factor Runx2/Cbfa1. Gradients of immobilized retrovirus, achieved via deposition of controlled poly(L-lysine) densities, resulted in spatial patterns of transcription factor expression, osteoblastic differentiation, and mineralized matrix deposition. Notably, this graded distribution of mineral deposition and mechanical properties was maintained when implanted in vivo in an ectopic site. Development of this facile and robust strategy is significant toward the regeneration of continuous interfacial zones that mimic the cellular and microstructural characteristics of native tissue.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aRetroviridae 3afibroblasts 3agene transfer 3agenetic engineering 3alysine 3amechanical properties 3amedicine 3amineralization 3aphenotype 3asowing 3atissue engineering 3atranscription factors1 aBurns, Kellie L.1 aLe Doux, Joseph M.1 aGuldberg, Robert E.1 aGarcía, Andrés J.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2008 Aug. 26, v. 105, no. 34 p.12170-12175dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.08019881053Available from publisher's Web site  a20080830b20080905c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle03152naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100002700184245012900211300002000340506007600360520156500436506003702001650001802038650001902056650001702075650001702092650001002109650001102119650002902130650002202159650001502181650001302196650001402209650002602223650001702249700002102266700002202287700002702309700002002336773017602356852000902532856008302541930003302624946001302657655001202670IND4409615220221207115135.0080829e20080826xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440961522DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.08053741052doi7 aPMC25278772pmcid7 a187138662pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDubikovskaya, Elena A.10aOvercoming multidrug resistance of small-molecule therapeutics through conjugation with releasable octaarginine transporters  ap. 12128-12133.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aMany cancer therapeutic agents elicit resistance that renders them ineffective and often produces cross-resistance to other drugs. One of the most common mechanisms of resistance involves P-glycoprotein (Pgp)-mediated drug efflux. To address this problem, new agents have been sought that are less prone to inducing resistance and less likely to serve as substrates for Pgp efflux. An alternative to this approach is to deliver established agents as molecular transporter conjugates into cells through a mechanism that circumvents Pgp-mediated efflux and allows for release of free drug only after cell entry. Here we report that the widely used chemotherapeutic agent Taxol, ineffective against Taxol-resistant human ovarian cancer cell lines, can be incorporated into a releasable octaarginine conjugate that is effective against the same Taxol-resistant cell lines. It is significant that the ability of the Taxol conjugates to overcome Taxol resistance is observed both in cell culture and in animal models of ovarian cancer. The generality and mechanistic basis for this effect were also explored with coelenterazine, a Pgp substrate. Although coelenterazine itself does not enter cells because of Pgp efflux, its octaarginine conjugate does so readily. This approach shows generality for overcoming the multidrug resistance elicited by small-molecule cancer chemotherapeutics and could improve the prognosis for many patients with cancer and fundamentally alter search strategies for novel therapeutic agents that are effective against resistant disease.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aanimal models 3aanimal ovaries 3acell culture 3adrug therapy 3adrugs 3ahumans 3amultiple drug resistance 3aovarian neoplasms 3apaclitaxel 3apatients 3aprognosis 3aresistance mechanisms 3atransporters1 aThorne, Steve H.1 aPillow, Thomas H.1 aContag, Christopher H.1 aWender, Paul A.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2008 Aug. 26, v. 105, no. 34 p.12128-12133dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.08053741053Available from publisher's Web site  a20080830b20080905c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02590naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100002800184245007100212300002000283506007600303520113800379506003701517650001301554650001601567650001801583650001801601650001801619650002801637650003701665700002201702700002501724700002501749700002401774700002001798700002401818773017601842852000902018856008302027930003302110946001302143655001202156IND4409340620221207102716.0080822e20080819xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440934062DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.08017631052doi7 aPMC25753242pmcid7 a186979442pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGratton, Stephanie E.A.14aThe effect of particle design on cellular internalization pathways  ap. 11613-11618.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe interaction of particles with cells is known to be strongly influenced by particle size, but little is known about the interdependent role that size, shape, and surface chemistry have on cellular internalization and intracellular trafficking. We report on the internalization of specially designed, monodisperse hydrogel particles into HeLa cells as a function of size, shape, and surface charge. We employ a top-down particle fabrication technique called PRINT that is able to generate uniform populations of organic micro- and nanoparticles with complete control of size, shape, and surface chemistry. Evidence of particle internalization was obtained by using conventional biological techniques and transmission electron microscopy. These findings suggest that HeLa cells readily internalize nonspherical particles with dimensions as large as 3 μm by using several different mechanisms of endocytosis. Moreover, it was found that rod-like particles enjoy an appreciable advantage when it comes to internalization rates, reminiscent of the advantage that many rod-like bacteria have for internalization in nonphagocytic cells.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abacteria 3aendocytosis 3ahydrocolloids 3ananoparticles 3aparticle size 3aphysiological transport 3atransmission electron microscopy1 aRopp, Patricia A.1 aPohlhaus, Patrick D.1 aLuft, J.

(2007) Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 104: 16016-16021]. This impact is claimed to have triggered the Younger Dryas major cooling event and resulted in the extinction of the North American megafauna. The impact is also claimed to have caused major cultural changes and population decline among the Paleoindians. Here, we report a study in which [almost equal to]1,500 radiocarbon dates from archaeological sites in Canada and the United States were used to test the hypothesis that the ET resulted in population decline among the Paleoindians. Following recent studies [e.g., Gamble C, Davies W, Pettitt P, Hazelwood L, Richards M (2005) Camb Archaeol J 15:193-223), the summed probability distribution of the calibrated dates was used to identify probable changes in human population size between 15,000 and 9,000 calBP. Subsequently, potential biases were evaluated by modeling and spatial analysis of the dated occupations. The results of the analyses were not consistent with the predictions of extraterrestrial impact hypothesis. No evidence of a population decline among the Paleoindians at 12,900 ± 100 calBP was found. Thus, minimally, the study suggests the extraterrestrial impact hypothesis should be amended.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3acooling 3ademography 3aextinction 3afauna 3ahuman population 3amodels 3aoccupations 3apopulation dynamics 3apopulation size 3aprediction 3aprobability distribution 3aCanada 3aUnited States1 aCollard, Mark1 aEdinborough, Kevan0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2008 Aug. 19, v. 105, no. 33 p.11651-11654dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.08037621053Available from publisher's Web site  a20080822b20080905c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02512naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100002200184245012100206300002000327506007600347520106500423506003701488650001001525650002401535650001101559650001901570650001701589650001601606650003701622700001401659700001701673700002101690700001601711700001701727700002001744773017601764852000901940856008301949930003302032946001302065655001202078IND4409340720221207102725.0080822e20080819xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440934072DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.08015201052doi7 aPMC25753092pmcid7 a186979372pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDubrovinskaia, N.13aAn insight into what superconducts in polycrystalline boron-doped diamonds based on investigations of microstructure  ap. 11619-11622.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe discovery of superconductivity in polycrystalline boron-doped diamond (BDD) synthesized under high pressure and high temperatures [Ekimov, et al. (2004) Nature 428:542-545] has raised a number of questions on the origin of the superconducting state. It was suggested that the heavy boron doping of diamond eventually leads to superconductivity. To justify such statements more detailed information on the microstructure of the composite materials and on the exact boron content in the diamond grains is needed. For that we used high-resolution transmission electron microscopy and electron energy loss spectroscopy. For the studied superconducting BDD samples synthesized at high pressures and high temperatures the diamond grain sizes are [almost equal to]1-2 μm with a boron content between 0.2 (2) and 0.5 (1) at %. The grains are separated by 10- to 20-nm-thick layers and triangular-shaped pockets of predominantly (at least 95 at %) amorphous boron. These results render superconductivity caused by the heavy boron doping in diamond highly unlikely.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aboron 3acomposite materials 3aenergy 3amicrostructure 3aspectroscopy 3atemperature 3atransmission electron microscopy1 aWirth, R.1 aWosnitza, J.1 aPapageorgiou, T.1 aBraun, H.F.1 aMiyajima, N.1 aDubrovinsky, L.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2008 Aug. 19, v. 105, no. 33 p.11619-11622dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.08015201053Available from publisher's Web site  a20080822b20080905c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02006naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100001900184245008400203300002000287506007600307520076100383506003701144650002101181650001801202650001401220650001601234650001301250650001401263700002001277700002101297773017601318852000901494856008301503930003301586946001301619655001201632IND4409341920221207102627.0080822e20080819xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440934192DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.08056331052doi7 aPMC25752582pmcid7 a186952462pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMoore, Sean D.10aForced extraction of targeted components from complex macromolecular assemblies  ap. 11685-11690.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aWhen individual protein components of supramolecular complexes are required for assembly, determining whether they play additional structural or functional roles can be difficult. Removing a protein from the complex after assembly can circumvent this problem. Here, we show that an AAA+ unfoldase/protease can extract an essential assembly protein from the ribosome. Specifically, Mg²⁺ depletion allowed ClpXP to remove an ssrA-tagged variant of ribosomal protein L22 from the 50S subunit of E. coli ribosomes without disrupting either the structural integrity or hydrodynamic properties of the modified particle. Forced extraction using AAA+ enzymes and targeted component proteins should be broadly applicable to the study of macromolecular complexes.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aEscherichia coli 3ahydrodynamics 3amagnesium 3aproteinases 3aproteins 3aribosomes1 aBaker, Tania A.1 aSauer, Robert T.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2008 Aug. 19, v. 105, no. 33 p.11685-11690dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.08056331053Available from publisher's Web site  a20080822b20080905c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle03244naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100001700184245011300201300002000314506007600334520171400410506003702124650001302161650001802174650001702192650001802209650002602227650004102253650004402294650002002338650002402358700001502382700002202397700002102419700002302440700002102463773017602484852000902660856008302669930003302752946001302785655001202798IND4409343220221207102645.0080822e20080819xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440934322DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.07085831052doi7 aPMC25752812pmcid7 a186896842pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Yajie10aTyr130 phosphorylation triggers Syk release from antigen receptor by long-distance conformational uncoupling  ap. 11760-11765.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe Syk protein-tyrosine kinase plays a major role in signaling through the B cell receptor for antigen (BCR). Syk binds the receptor via its tandem pair of SH2 domains interacting with a doubly phosphorylated immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (dp-ITAM) of the BCR complex. Upon phosphorylation of Tyr-130, which lies between the two SH2 domains distant to the phosphotyrosine binding sites, Syk dissociates from the receptor. To understand the structural basis for this dissociation, we investigated the structural and dynamic characteristics of the wild type tandem SH2 region (tSH2) and a variant tandem SH2 region (tSH2pm) with Tyr-130 substituted by Glu to permanently introduce a negative charge at this position. NMR heteronuclear relaxation experiments, residual dipolar coupling measurements and analytical ultracentrifugation revealed substantial differences in the hydrodynamic behavior of tSH2 and tSH2pm. Although the two SH2 domains in tSH2 are tightly associated, the two domains in tSH2pm are partly uncoupled and tumble in solution with a faster correlation time. In addition, the equilibrium dissociation constant for the binding of tSH2pm to dp-ITAM (1.8 μM) is significantly higher than that for the interaction between dp-ITAM and tSH2 but is close to that for a singly tyrosine-phosphorylated peptide binding to a single SH2 domain. Experimental data and hydrodynamic calculations both suggest a loss of domain-domain contacts and change in relative orientation upon the introduction of a negative charge on residue 130. A long-distance structural mechanism by which the phosphorylation of Y130 negatively regulates the interaction of Syk with immune receptors is proposed.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aantigens 3abinding sites 3adissociation 3ahydrodynamics 3aimmunologic receptors 3anon-specific protein-tyrosine kinase 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aphosphorylation 3aultracentrifugation1 aOh, Hyunju1 aBurton, Robert A.1 aBurgner, John W.1 aGeahlen, Robert L.1 aPost, Carol Beth0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2008 Aug. 19, v. 105, no. 33 p.11760-11765dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.07085831053Available from publisher's Web site  a20080822b20080905c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02304naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100001700184245007800201300002000279506007600299520081100375506003701186650002001223650001701243650002701260650002801287650001201315650001101327700001301338700001701351700001901368700002001387700001801407700002101425700001301446700002101459700002101480700001901501773017601520852000901696856008301705930003301788946001301821655001201834IND4409342720221207102711.0080822e20080819xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440934272DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.08051821052doi7 aPMC25752752pmcid7 a186896812pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBeck, Rainer10aMembrane curvature induced by Arf1-GTP is essential for vesicle formation  ap. 11731-11736.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe GTPase Arf1 is considered as a molecular switch that regulates binding and release of coat proteins that polymerize on membranes to form transport vesicles. Here, we show that Arf1-GTP induces positive membrane curvature and find that the small GTPase can dimerize dependent on GTP. Investigating a possible link between Arf dimerization and curvature formation, we isolated an Arf1 mutant that cannot dimerize. Although it was capable of exerting the classical role of Arf1 as a coat receptor, it could not mediate the formation of COPI vesicles from Golgi-membranes and was lethal when expressed in yeast.

The results show that macromolecular crowding affects protein-folding dynamics as well as overall protein shape. In crowded milieus, distinct conformational changes in VlsE are accompanied by secondary structure alterations that lead to exposure of a hidden antigenic region. Our work demonstrates the malleability of "native" proteins and implies that crowding-induced shape changes may be important for protein function and malfunction in vivo.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aBorrelia burgdorferi 3aprotein folding 3aproteins1 aPerham, Michael1 aSamiotakis, Antonios1 aCheung, Margaret S.1 aWittung-Stafshede, Pernilla0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2008 Aug. 19, v. 105, no. 33 p.11754-11759dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.08036721053Available from publisher's Web site  a20080822b20080905c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02578naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100003200184245013300216300002000349506007600369520107700445506003701522650001601559650002201575650002501597650001701622650002001639650002401659650002401683700002501707700002001732700002101752700002101773700001901794700001701813773017601830852000902006856008302015930003302098946001302131655001202144IND4409342920221207102723.0080822e20080819xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440934292DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.08048281052doi7 aPMC25753352pmcid7 a187017202pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aColletier, Jacques-Philippe10aShoot-and-Trap: Use of specific x-ray damage to study structural protein dynamics by temperature-controlled cryo-crystallography  ap. 11742-11747.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aAlthough x-ray crystallography is the most widely used method for macromolecular structure determination, it does not provide dynamical information, and either experimental tricks or complementary experiments must be used to overcome the inherently static nature of crystallographic structures. Here we used specific x-ray damage during temperature-controlled crystallographic experiments at a third-generation synchrotron source to trigger and monitor (Shoot-and-Trap) structural changes putatively involved in an enzymatic reaction. In particular, a nonhydrolyzable substrate analogue of acetylcholinesterase, the "off-switch" at cholinergic synapses, was radiocleaved within the buried enzymatic active site. Subsequent product clearance, observed at 150 K but not at 100 K, indicated exit from the active site possibly via a "backdoor." The simple strategy described here is, in principle, applicable to any enzyme whose structure in complex with a substrate analogue is available and, therefore, could serve as a standard procedure in kinetic crystallography studies.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aX-radiation 3aX-ray diffraction 3aacetylcholinesterase 3aactive sites 3acrystallography 3aenzymatic reactions 3astructural proteins1 aBourgeois, Dominique1 aSanson, Benoît1 aFournier, Didier1 aSussman, Joel L.1 aSilman, Israel1 aWeik, Martin0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2008 Aug. 19, v. 105, no. 33 p.11742-11747dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.08048281053Available from publisher's Web site  a20080822b20080905c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02938naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100001800184245006700202300002000269500001500289506007600304520138300380506003701763650003601800650002401836650003201860650002001892650001401912650002601926653001301952700001701965700001901982700001902001700001502020700001502035700001402050700001402064700001802078700001502096700001902111773017602130852000902306856008302315930003302398946001302431655001202444IND4409343520221207103436.0080822e20080819xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440934352DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.07111221052doi7 aPMC25753302pmcid7 a186979352pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMahoney, D.J.10aBoth cIAP1 and cIAP2 regulate TNFα-mediated NF-κB activation  ap. 11778-11783.  a2019-12-04  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe cellular inhibitor of apoptosis 1 and 2 (cIAP1 and cIAP2) proteins have been implicated in the activation of NF-κB by TNFα; however, genetic deletion of either cIAP1 or 2 did not support a physiologically relevant role, perhaps because of functional redundancy. To address this, we used combined genetic and siRNA knockdown approaches and report that cIAP1 and 2 are indeed critical, yet redundant, regulators of NF-κB activation upon TNFα treatment. Whereas NF-κB was properly activated by TNFα in cultured and primary cells deficient in either cIAP1 or 2, removal of both cIAPs severely blunted its activation. After treatment with TNFα, cIAP1 and 2 were rapidly recruited to the TNF receptor 1, along with the adapter protein TNF receptor associated factor 2. Importantly, either cIAP1 or 2 was required for proper TNF receptor 1 signalosome function. In their combined absence, polyubiquitination of receptor interacting protein 1, an upstream event necessary for NF-κB signaling, was attenuated. As a result, phosphorylation of the inhibitor of κB kinase β was diminished, and signal transduction was severely blunted. Consequently, cells missing both cIAP1 and 2 were sensitized to TNFα-mediated apoptosis. Collectively, these data demonstrate that either cIAP1 or 2 is required for proper Rip1 polyubiquitination and NF-κB activation upon TNFα treatment.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3atranscription factor NF-kappa B 3asignal transduction 3atumor necrosis factor-alpha 3aphosphorylation 3aapoptosis 3asmall interfering RNA 0aproteins1 aCheung, H.H.1 aMrad, R.

Similar constraints may apply to social groups as they grow in size. The communal three-dimensional webs that social spiders build function ecologically as single units that intercept prey through their surface and should thus be subject to this constraint. Accordingly, we show that web prey capture area per spider, and thus number of insects captured per capita, decreases with colony size in a neotropical social spider. Prey biomass intake per capita, however, peaks at intermediate colony sizes because the spiders forage cooperatively and larger colonies capture increasingly large insects. A peaked prey biomass intake function would explain not only why these spiders live in groups and cooperate but also why they disperse only at large colony sizes, thus addressing both sociality and colony size range in this social spider. These findings may also explain the conspicuous absence of social spiders from higher latitudes and higher elevations, areas that we have previously shown to harbor considerably fewer insects of the largest size classes than the lowland tropical rainforests where social spiders thrive. Our findings thus illustrate the relevance of scaling laws to the size and functioning of levels of organization above the individual.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aTheridiidae 3asocial behavior 3apredation 3aforaging 3apredator-prey relationships 3aEcuador 0aanimal behavior 0aAnelosimus eximius 0acolony size 0afeeding behavior1 aPowers, Kimberly S.1 aAvilés, Leticia0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2008 Aug. 19, v. 105, no. 33 p.11818-11822dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.07106031053Available from publisher's Web site  a20080911b20081011c00000000  aINDdRHFe2008/09/11  aOther US 7aarticle03319naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100002200184245014500206300002000351506007600371520157100447506003702018650002202055650000802077650001502085650000902100650001402109650001402123650000902137650001302146650001402159650002302173650003502196651001102231700002302242700003002265700002402295700001702319700001802336700001702354700002402371700002302395700002402418700002102442773017602463852000902639856008302648930003302731946001302764655001202777IND4409345120221207103347.0080822e20080819xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440934512DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.08047991052doi7 aPMC24914852pmcid7 a186676982pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLettre, Guillaume10aDNA polymorphisms at the BCL11A, HBS1L-MYB, and β-globin loci associate with fetal hemoglobin levels and pain crises in sickle cell disease  ap. 11869-11874.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aSickle cell disease (SCD) is a debilitating monogenic blood disorder with a highly variable phenotype characterized by severe pain crises, acute clinical events, and early mortality. Interindividual variation in fetal hemoglobin (HbF) expression is a known and potentially heritable modifier of SCD severity. High HbF levels are correlated with reduced morbidity and mortality. Common single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) at the BCL11A and HBS1L-MYB loci have been implicated previously in HbF level variation in nonanemic European populations. We recently demonstrated an association between a BCL11A SNP and HbF levels in one SCD cohort [Uda M, et al. (2008) Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 105:1620-1625]. Here, we genotyped additional BCL11A SNPs, HBS1L-MYB SNPs, and an SNP upstream of Gγ-globin (HBG2; the XmnI polymorphism), in two independent SCD cohorts: the African American Cooperative Study of Sickle Cell Disease (CSSCD) and an SCD cohort from Brazil. We studied the effect of these SNPs on HbF levels and on a measure of SCD-related morbidity (pain crisis rate). We strongly replicated the association between these SNPs and HbF level variation (in the CSSCD, P values range from 0.04 to 2 x 10⁻⁴²). Together, common SNPs at the BCL11A, HBS1L-MYB, and β-globin (HBB) loci account for >20% of the variation in HbF levels in SCD patients. We also have shown that HbF-associated SNPs associate with pain crisis rate in SCD patients. These results provide a clear example of inherited common sequence variants modifying the severity of a monogenic disease.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aAfrican Americans 3aDNA 3ahemoglobin 3aloci 3amorbidity 3amortality 3apain 3apatients 3aphenotype 3asickle cell anemia 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism 3aBrazil1 aSankaran, Vijay G.1 aBezerra, Marcos André C.1 aAraújo, Aderson S.1 aUda, Manuela1 aSanna, Serena1 aCao, Antonio1 aSchlessinger, David1 aCosta, Fernando F.1 aHirschhorn, Joel N.1 aOrkin, Stuart H.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2008 Aug. 19, v. 105, no. 33 p.11869-11874dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.08047991053Available from publisher's Web site  a20080822b20080905c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02710naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100002400184245007900208300002000287506007600307520122100383506003701604650000801641650001501649650002701664650001301691650001101704650002901715650002301744650002101767650002201788650001101810700002401821700002601845700002201871700002101893700002401914773017601938852000902114856008302123930003302206946001302239655001202252IND4409344720221207103402.0080822e20080819xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440934472DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.08045291052doi7 aPMC25156202pmcid7 a187017152pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aArgueso, Juan Lucas10aDouble-strand breaks associated with repetitive DNA can reshape the genome  ap. 11845-11850.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aIonizing radiation is an established source of chromosome aberrations (CAs). Although double-strand breaks (DSBs) are implicated in radiation-induced and other CAs, the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. Here, we show that, although the vast majority of randomly induced DSBs in G₂ diploid yeast cells are repaired efficiently through homologous recombination (HR) between sister chromatids or homologous chromosomes, [almost equal to]2% of all DSBs give rise to CAs. Complete molecular analysis of the genome revealed that nearly all of the CAs resulted from HR between nonallelic repetitive elements, primarily Ty retrotransposons. Nonhomologous end-joining (NHEJ) accounted for few, if any, of the CAs. We conclude that only those DSBs that fall at the 3-5% of the genome composed of repetitive DNA elements are efficient at generating rearrangements with dispersed small repeats across the genome, whereas DSBs in unique sequences are confined to recombinational repair between the large regions of homology contained in sister chromatids or homologous chromosomes. Because repeat-associated DSBs can efficiently lead to CAs and reshape the genome, they could be a rich source of evolutionary change.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDNA 3achromatids 3achromosome aberrations 3adiploidy 3agenome 3ahomologous recombination 3aionizing radiation 3aretrotransposons 3asequence analysis 3ayeasts1 aWestmoreland, James1 aMieczkowski, Piotr A.1 aGawel, Malgorzata1 aPetes, Thomas D.1 aResnick, Michael A.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2008 Aug. 19, v. 105, no. 33 p.11845-11850dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.08045291053Available from publisher's Web site  a20080822b20080905c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02473naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100002200184245011000206300002000316506007600336520107700412506003701489650001301526650001901539650002201558650001301580650002001593650001101613650001501624650001301639650003201652700001501684700002001699700001801719773017601737852000901913856008301922930003302005946001302038655001202051IND4409346220221207120252.0080822e20080819xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440934622DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.08046211052doi7 aPMC25752902pmcid7 a186952472pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDutton, Rachel J.10aBacterial species exhibit diversity in their mechanisms and capacity for protein disulfide bond formation  ap. 11933-11938.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aProtein disulfide bond formation contributes to the folding and activity of many exported proteins in bacteria. However, information about disulfide bond formation is limited to only a few bacterial species. We used a multifaceted bioinformatic approach to assess the capacity for disulfide bond formation across this biologically diverse group of organisms. We combined data from a cysteine counting method, in which a significant bias for even numbers of cysteine in proteins is taken as an indicator of disulfide bond formation, with data on the presence of homologs of known disulfide bond formation enzymes. These combined data enabled us to make predictions about disulfide bond formation in the cell envelope across bacterial species. Our bioinformatic and experimental results suggest that many bacteria may not generally oxidatively fold proteins, and implicate the bacterial homolog of the enzyme vitamin K epoxide reductase, a protein required for blood clotting in humans, as part of a disulfide bond formation pathway present in several major bacterial phyla.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abacteria 3abioinformatics 3ablood coagulation 3acysteine 3adisulfide bonds 3ahumans 3aprediction 3aproteins 3avitamin K epoxide reductase1 aBoyd, Dana1 aBerkmen, Mehmet1 aBeckwith, Jon0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2008 Aug. 19, v. 105, no. 33 p.11933-11938dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.08046211053Available from publisher's Web site  a20080822b20080905c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle03174naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100001900184245007200203300002000275506007600295520173500371506003702106650001802143650001102161650002302172650002002195650002102215650003102236650001502267700002502282700002002307700002202327700002602349700002402375700002702399773017602426852000902602856008302611930003302694946001302727655001202740IND4409345720221207120301.0080822e20080819xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440934572DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.08015061052doi7 aPMC25752732pmcid7 a186952192pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aListon, Adrian10aDifferentiation of regulatory Foxp3⁺ T cells in the thymic cortex  ap. 11903-11908.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aRegulatory Foxp3⁺ T cells (TR) are indispensable for preventing autoimmune pathology in multiple organs and tissues. During thymic differentiation T cell receptor (TCR)-ligand interactions within a certain increased affinity range, in conjunction with γc-containing cytokine receptor signals, induce Foxp3 expression and thereby commit developing thymocytes to the TR lineage. The contribution of distinct MHC class II-expressing accessory cell types to the differentiation process of Foxp3⁺ thymocytes remains controversial, because a unique role in this process has been ascribed to either thymic dendritic cells (tDC) or to medullary thymic epithelial cells (mTEC). Furthermore, it was suggested that the thymic medulla, where the bulk of the negative selection of self-reactive thymocytes takes place, provides a specialized microenvironment supporting TR differentiation. Here, we report that the cortex, as defined by cortical thymic epithelial cells (cTEC), is sufficient for supporting TR differentiation. MHC class II expression restricted to both cTEC and mTEC or to cTEC alone did not significantly affect the numbers of Foxp3⁺ thymocytes. Furthermore, genetic or pharmacologic blockade of thymocyte migration resulted in a prominent accumulation of Foxp3⁺ thymocytes in the cortex, demonstrating that secondary signals required for Foxp3 up-regulation exist in the cortex. Our results suggest that mTEC or tDC do not serve as a cell type singularly responsible for TR differentiation and that neither the cortex nor the medulla exclusively provides an environment suitable for Foxp3 induction. Instead, multiple accessory cell types probably contribute to the thymic generation of regulatory Foxp3⁺ T cells.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aT-lymphocytes 3acortex 3acytokine receptors 3adendritic cells 3aepithelial cells 3agene expression regulation 3athymocytes1 aNutsch, Katherine M.1 aFarr, Andrew G.1 aLund, Jennifer M.1 aRasmussen, Jeffery P.1 aKoni, Pandelakis A.1 aRudensky, Alexander Y.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2008 Aug. 19, v. 105, no. 33 p.11903-11908dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.08015061053Available from publisher's Web site  a20080822b20080905c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle03943naa a2200757 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002300164245005400187300001400241500024300255500001500498520155600513592002802069650001702097650001602114650001602130650001502146650001802161650001802179650001502197650002002212650002002232650001802252650001402270650001702284650001102301650002502312650001302337650001402350650001402364650001802378650002602396650001402422650001602436650001502452650003802467650001702505650002802522650000902550650003702559650002902596650001102625650002602636650001502662650002902677650004402706653002302750653001302773653001902786653001102805700003102816700001902847773013302866852000902999856008503008930003303093945001303126946001103139990002303150655001203173IND2328331620221117200600.0020801e20020101sz |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232833162DNAL7 a118877542pmid7 a10.1024/0300-9831.72.1.532doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 avan den Berg, Henk10aInfluence of Lifestyle on Vitamin Bioavailability  ap. 53-59.  aIn the special issue: Bioavailability 2001: Bioavailability of micronutrients in relation to human health / edited by R.

Alcohol effects are clearly dose-dependent. Excessive chronic alcohol intake is generally associated with vitamin deficiency (especially folate, thiamine, and vitamin B6) due to malnutrition, malabsorption, and ethanol toxicity. Effects of moderate alcohol use are mainly explained by a lower vitamin intake. In the case of vitamin A and beta-carotene, effects on post-absorptive (lipoprotein) metabolism have been demonstrated. In one diet-controlled crossover study, alcohol consumption resulted in an increase in the plasma vitamin B6 (PLP) content, especially after beer consumption (containing vitamin B6), but also after wine and spirit consumption (not containing vitamin B6). Smoking is also associated with a lower dietary vitamin intake. In the case of vitamin C, B12, folate, and beta-carotene, evidence has been presented for effects on postabsorptive metabolism, due to smoke-induced oxidative stress and/or vitamin inactivation. For vitamin E a direct effect of smoking on absorption has been demonstrated. There is no convincing evidence that low-fat diets negatively affect fat-soluble vitamin absorption, but cholesterol-lowering compounds (diets), or unabsorbable fat substitutes, may do so. Vitamin bioavailability may be compromised from certain vegetables (particularly raw), and/or from high-fiber foods, because of limited digestion and inefficient release of vitamins from the food matrix.  aPublisher supplied data 3amalnutrition 3avitamin B12 3adietary fat 3afolic acid 3adose response 3afat replacers 3apyridoxine 3anutrient uptake 3asmoking (habit) 3abeta-carotene 3aoxidation 3ablood lipids 3ahumans 3avitamin deficiencies 3atoxicity 3alifestyle 3avitamin A 3aascorbic acid 3anutrient availability 3avitamin E 3acholesterol 3avegetables 2aAlcohol Drinkingxadverse effects 2aAvitaminosis 2aBiological Availability 2aDiet 2aDose-Response Relationship, Drug 2aEthanolxadverse effects 2aHumans 2aIntestinal Absorption 2aLife Style 2aSmokingxadverse effects 2aVitaminsxmetabolismxpharmacokinetics. 0aliterature reviews 0avitamins 0aalcohol intake 0astress1 avan der Gaag ( ), Martijn1 aHendriks, Henk0 tInternational journal for vitamin and nutrition research.g2002 Jan. 1, v. 72, no. 1 p.53-59dVerlag Hans Huberx0300-98317nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1024/0300-9831.72.1.533Available from publisher's Web site  a20021002b20021010c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US  mNon-PubAg articles 7aarticle04121naa a2200685 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100003100164245005500195300001400250500024300264500001500507520183800522592002802360650002002388650001502408650000902423650001002432650001402442650001102456650001502467650001202482650002602494650002002520650002402540650001702564650001602581650002002597650001802617650001402635650001502649650002802664650001602692650001702708650002102725650003102746650003902777650004302816650006502859650003702924650001102961650002602972650005002998653001503048653002303063653001003086700002003096773013303116852000903249856008503258930003303343945001303376946001103389990002303400655001203423IND2328330720221117200556.0020801e20020101sz |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232833072DNAL7 a118877472pmid7 a10.1024/0300-9831.72.1.132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFairweather-Tait, Susan J.10aCalcium Bioavailability in Relation to Bone Health  ap. 13-18.  aIn the special issue: Bioavailability 2001: Bioavailability of micronutrients in relation to human health / edited by R.

Paper presented at a symposium held May 30-June 1, 2001, Interlaken, Switzerland.  a2019-12-04  aA well established stable isotope technique exists for measuring calcium absorption from single foods and meals, but the long term effects of calcium on bone health cannot be assessed from acute bioavailability studies. Bone health depends primarily on the degree of mineralization, measured as bone mineral density (BMD), and phenotypic variations depend on genetic and environmental factors including calcium supply. Since almost all retained calcium is used for bone mineralization and remodeling, BMD can be used as a long-term (> six months) marker of dietary calcium bioavailability. However, BMD is a very insensitive marker of calcium bioavailability, so its use in dietary intervention studies is restricted to periods of significant bone growth or loss. Biochemical markers of bone metabolism may be used to predict the overall bioavailability of dietary calcium over a shorter time period (> four weeks), but they have a high coefficient of variation, so may not be appropriate for some dietary intervention studies. A group of European laboratories is currently developing an alternative approach using a long-lived radioisotope (<sup>41</sup>Ca) to label bone calcium and to directly measure the rate of calcium loss from urinary excretion data. The efficiency of calcium absorption is inversely related to intake; whole body balance of the mineral is dependent on rates of absorption and excretion and limited by calcium-binding substances in the gut. Dietary data and indirect measures of bone health indicate that bioavailability is important when habitual intakes are low, especially during periods of bone growth or loss. Further research is required to quantify the effects of major dietary modulators of calcium balance on bone health and to understand their relationship with genetic and physiological variables.  aPublisher supplied data 3anutrient intake 3ametabolism 3adiet 3aurine 3aphenotype 3ahumans 3abiomarkers 3acalcium 3anutrient availability 3anutrient uptake 3abone mineralization 3abone density 3ameasurement 3astable isotopes 3abone strength 3aexcretion 3aprediction 2aBiological Availability 2aBiomarkers. 2aBone Density 2aBone Development 2aCalcification, Physiologic 2aCalciumxbloodxmetabolismxurine. 2aCalcium Radioisotopesxdiagnostic use. 2aCalcium, Dietaryxadministration & dosagexpharmacokinetics. 2aDose-Response Relationship, Drug 2aHumans 2aIntestinal Absorption 2aOsteoporosisxetiologyxprevention & control. 0aefficiency 0aliterature reviews 0abones1 aTeucher, Birgit0 tInternational journal for vitamin and nutrition research.g2002 Jan. 1, v. 72, no. 1 p.13-18dVerlag Hans Huberx0300-98317nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1024/0300-9831.72.1.133Available from publisher's Web site  a20021002b20021010c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US  mNon-PubAg articles 7aarticle03669naa a2200745 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003600111040001800147100002300165245006600188300001600254500001500270520157500285592002801860650001201888650001701900650000801917650001001925650001701935650002101952650002101973650001601994650001802010650001402028650001002042650000902052650002202061650002202083650001702105650003102122650002302153650002302176650001102199650001102210650002202221650000902243650001602252650003302268650002102301650002302322650002502345650002102370653002002391653001802411653001502429653001002444653001602454653002002470700002202490700001802512700002902530700002102559700002102580773013502601852000902736856008602745930003302831945001302864946001102877990002302888655001202911IND2328135020221117200644.0020720e20011101sz |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232813502DNAL7 a118408362pmid7 a10.1024/0300-9831.71.6.3322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGaribaldi, Silvano10aPlasma Protein Oxidation and Antioxidant Defense During Aging  ap. 332-338.  a2019-12-04  aBackground: Oxidative stress is an important process that occurs in vivo during aging and is considered one of the main causes of molecular damage to cellular and tissue structures. These changes can accumulate in biological structures during aging. Objective: The aim of this work is to evaluate plasma protein oxidative damage, measured as carbonyl groups content, and the concentration of some antioxidant molecules (vitamins and carotenoids) in 122 healthy volunteers (50 males and 72 females), 25 to 89 years old. Results: Total plasma proteins slightly decreased with age, but the level of carbonyl groups was similar in the adult (< 65 years) and in the old, and was similar in both sexes. Plasma concentration of antioxidant molecules such as a-tocopherol, b-carotene and other carotenoids, increased with age and correlated with the level of lipoproteins; plasma total cholesterol and triglycerides were significantly correlated with age as well. Conclusions: The surprisingly normal level of plasma protein carbonyl groups in our older subjects suggests two possibilities: a) the older people in our study are healthy and free from pathologies because of better protection against oxidative injury during their lifetimes, i.e., they maintained low-level oxidative damage on plasma proteins; or b) the level of carbonyl groups is normal because of the high turnover in plasma: the oxidized circulating proteins are preferentially and quickly removed; in this case oxidative damage is not discernible in plasma proteins but may proceed silently in other tissues.  aPublisher supplied data 3aelderly 3ablood lipids 3amen 3awomen 3alipoproteins 3atriacylglycerols 3aalpha-tocopherol 3acholesterol 3abeta-carotene 3aoxidation 2aAdult 2aAged 2aAged, 80 and over 2aAgingxphysiology 2aAntioxidants 2aBlood Proteinsxmetabolism 2aCarotenoidsxblood 2aCholesterolxblood 2aFemale 2aHumans 2aHydrazonesxblood 2aMale 2aMiddle Aged 2aOxidative Stressxphysiology 2aReference Values 2aTocopherolsxblood 2aTriglyceridesxblood 2aVitamin Axblood 0ablood chemistry 0ablood protein 0ainhibitors 0aaging 0acarotenoids 0aage differences1 aValentini, Sabina1 aAragno, Irene1 aPronzato, Maria Adelaide1 aTraverso, Nicola1 aOdetti, Patrizio0 tInternational journal for vitamin and nutrition research.g2001 Nov. 1, v. 71, no. 6 p.332-338dVerlag Hans Huberx0300-98317nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1024/0300-9831.71.6.3323Available from publisher's Web site  a20020903b20020909c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US  mNon-PubAg articles 7aarticle03048naa a2200601 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003600111040001800147100002200165245013000187300001600317500001500333520105300348592002801401650002101429650001401450650001701464650002901481650001601510650001601526650001801542650002101560650001601581650001701597650007301614650006901687650001201756650001301768650002901781650002401810650003201834650002101866650002201887650000901909650005901918650005401977653001502031653003102046653002302077653001102100773013502111852000902246856008602255930003302341945001302374946001102387961001302398990002302411655001202434IND2328135520221117200555.0020720e20011101sz |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232813552DNAL7 a118408392pmid7 a10.1024/0300-9831.71.6.3522doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRosebrough, R.

Data from this experiment suggest that beta-adrenergic agonists have slight effects on feed intake, growth and more pronounced effects on metabolism in the broiler chicken. In vitro lipogenesis (IVL) was determined by incubating liver explants for 2 h at 37°C in the presence of cAMP or isoproterenol (ISO) and [2-<sup>14</sup>C]acetate and by measuring acetate incorporation into total hepatic lipid. Metaproterenol and yohimbine (100 mg/kg) depressed growth from 7 to 28 days. Both metaproterenol and yohimbine (100 mg/kg) decreased (P < 0.05) IVL compared to controls. These dietary additions also decreased (P < 0.05) hepatic malic enzyme activity without affecting the activities of either isocitrate dehydrogenase or aspartate aminotransferase.  aPublisher supplied data 3abroiler chickens 3aadenosine 3amalic enzyme 3abeta-adrenergic agonists 3aantagonists 3alipogenesis 3aanimal models 3afeeding behavior 3afeed intake 3aisoprenaline 2aAdrenergic alpha-Antagonistsxadministration & dosagexpharmacology. 2aAdrenergic beta-Agonistsxadministration & dosagexpharmacology. 2aAnimals 2aChickens 2aCyclic AMPxpharmacology 2aIn Vitro Techniques 2aIsoproterenolxpharmacology 2aLipid Metabolism 2aLiverxmetabolism 2aMale 2aMetaproterenolxadministration & dosagexpharmacology. 2aYohimbinexadministration & dosagexpharmacology. 0ametabolism 0aalpha-adrenergic receptors 0acyclic amino acids 0agrowth0 tInternational journal for vitamin and nutrition research.g2001 Nov. 1, v. 71, no. 6 p.352-355dVerlag Hans Huberx0300-98317nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1024/0300-9831.71.6.3523Available from publisher's Web site  a20020903b20020909c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US  aUSDA/ARS  mNon-PubAg articles 7aarticle03217naa a2200601 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003600111040001800147100002400165245013100189300001600320500018100336520120300517592002801720650001301748650000901761650001901770650001401789650002101803650002301824650001501847650001601862650001201878650001401890650001201904650001401916650001901930650001201949650006001961650002902021650001702050650002202067650001102089650001502100650002602115651002902141651002502170651002602195651004002221653002302261653001002284773013402294852000902428856008602437930003302523945001302556946001102569990002302580655001202603IND2325582320221117200612.0020224e20010501sz |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232558232DNAL7 a115828342pmid7 a10.1024/0300-9831.71.3.1412doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRumm-Kreuter, Doris10aComparison of the Eating and Cooking Habits of Northern Europe and the Mediterranean Countries in the Past, Present and Future  ap. 141-148.  aIn the special issue: Mediterranean diet: Its importance for today and tomorrow / edited by P. Walter. Paper presented at a symposium held September 23-25, 1999, Torino, Italy.  aIt was already possible to demonstrate in the 50s that the Mediterranean countries have significantly less coronary heart disease than northern Europe and the USA and that this correlated closely with the diets of people in the Mediterranean region. Consequently, the traditional Mediterranean corresponds to the ideas of dietetics about a preventive diet with its high percentage of fruit, vegetables, cereal products legumes, olive oil and its slight share of animal products. However, an increase of the share of animal products can be detected in the diet of the Mediterranean populations with increasing wealth to the detriment of basic foodstuffs on a vegetable basis and their positive effects. This is reducing the preventive effect of the diet. The dietary situation is also becoming worse in northern Europe, which was already found to be unfavorable in the 60s. The reasons for this development can be found in the substantial socioeconomic changes throughout all of Europe over the past 40 years. A return or reversal to the Mediterranean way of eating would be desirable due to its positive effects. But the strong trend to convenience products and eating out is in opposition to this.  aPublisher supplied data 3afoodways 3adiet 3aheart diseases 3aincidence 3ahealth promotion 3adisease prevention 3avegetables 3agrain crops 3alegumes 3aolive oil 3ahistory 3alifestyle 3asocioeconomics 2aCooking 2aCoronary Diseasexdiet therapyxepidemiologyxetiology. 2aCultural Characteristics 2aDietxtrends 2aFeeding Behavior. 2aHumans 2aLife Style 2aSocioeconomic Factors 3aNorthern European region 3aMediterranean region 0aEuropexepidemiology. 0aMediterranean Regionxepidemiology. 0aliterature reviews 0afruit0 tInternational journal for vitamin and nutrition research.g2001 May 1, v. 71, no. 3 p.141-148dVerlag Hans Huberx0300-98317nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1024/0300-9831.71.3.1413Available from publisher's Web site  a20020401b20020405c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US  mNon-PubAg articles 7aarticle03803naa a2200805 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003600111040001800147100001200165245010500177300001600282500001500298520141600313592002801729650001901757650001601776650001801792650001201810650002001822650001201842650001001854650002501864650001901889650002101908650001701929650001401946650001701960650002201977650002601999650002002025650001302045650001802058650001002076650002902086650002502115650002502140650003602165650001102201650001102212650003202223650002702255650004002282650003202322650003702354650002502391650001402416650002602430650002502456651001602481651002202497653002502519653003202544700002102576700002002597700001502617700001202632700001502644700001502659773013602674852000902810856008602819930003302905945001302938946001102951990002302962655001202985IND2327799420221117200556.0020630e20010901sz |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232779942DNAL7 a117256932pmid7 a10.1024/0300-9831.71.5.2862doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMin, Y.10aMaternal-Fetal N-6 and N-3 Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids Gradient in Plasma and Red Cell Phospholipids  ap. 286-292.  a2019-12-04  aFatty acid distribution was investigated in ethnically and economically homogenous Korean mothers (n = 40) and neonates. Venous blood, maternal before delivery and cord, was obtained. Choline (CPG) and ethanolamine (EPG) phosphoglycerides and sphingomyelin (SM) were assayed. Mean arachidonic acid (AA) level was higher in plasma CPG and SM (p < 0.0001), and red cell CPG (p < 0.0001), EPG (p < 0.0001) and SM (p = 0.005) of the neonates. Similarly, the neonates had higher proportions of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) in plasma CPG (p < 0.0001) and red cell CPG (p = 0.001) and EPG (p = 0.036). In contrast, linoleic and alpha-linolenic acids were significantly higher in maternal blood. Mead acid was elevated in plasma CPG (p < 0.0001) and red cell CPG and EPG (p < 0.0001) of the neonates. Consistent with data from high-fat-intake populations, our subjects, whose traditional diet is low in fat, exhibited maternal-fetal gradient in AA and DHA in plasma and red cell phospholipids. This may be due to an imbalance between supply and maternal and fetal requirements, and/or a physiological response to pregnancy. Prenatal nutritional constraint is associated with impaired development and a risk of chronic diseases in adults. AA and DHA are vital nutrients. Hence, there is a need to investigate whether the discrepancy between maternal and neonatal AA and DHA is a manifestation of nutritional insufficiency.  aPublisher supplied data 3asphingomyelins 3afood intake 3alinoleic acid 3acholine 3ablood chemistry 3amothers 3awomen 3adocosahexaenoic acid 3alinolenic acid 3aarachidonic acid 3aerythrocytes 3apregnancy 3aethanolamine 3afetal development 3anutrient requirements 3arisk assessment 3aneonates 3aphospholipids 2aAdult 2aErythrocytesxphysiology 2aFatty Acids, Omega-3 2aFatty Acids, Omega-6 2aFatty Acids, Unsaturatedxblood 2aFemale 2aHumans 2aHypolipidemic Agentsxblood 2aInfant, Newbornxblood 2aMaternal-Fetal Exchangexphysiology 2aPhosphatidylcholinesxblood 2aPhosphatidylethanolaminesxblood 2aPhospholipidsxblood 2aPregnancy 2aSphingomyelinsxblood 2aTriglyceridesxblood 3aSouth Korea 0aKoreaxethnology. 0aglycerophospholipids 0apolyunsaturated fatty acids1 aGhebremeskel, K.1 aCrawford, M.

Epidemiological Findings in the Unique Disease-free Urban Area of Cuba  ap. 274-285.  a2019-12-04  aA survey was conducted through the SECUBA (SEguridad alimentaria en CUba y Buena Alimentación) research program in Cuban healthy smokers living in Guantánamo and in Havana. The aim of the survey was to investigate biological and nutritional factors connected with the occurrence of zero epidemic neuropathy (EN) observed in Guantánamo urban area since the disease emerged in Cuba. Blood riboflavin status and carotenoid and selenium concentrations were higher in Guantánamo than in Havana smokers. Food dietary quantities of plantain banana, pepper (Capsicum spp.), bovine meat and milk products were higher in Guantánamo. Inversely, foods rich in cholesterol, especially eggs, were more consumed in Havana. Through riboflavin, carotenoid and selenium contents and specific antioxidants substances (indoleamines, capsaicin), the foods more consumed in Guantánamo could be considered as EN protective factors. Disease protective effects could be exerted via enhancement of defence mechanisms against free radical damage and related mechanisms focused on redox recycling of glutathione and local protection from carotenoids. Finally, the results of the present study should help Cuba, through a better EN control, to improve long-term food safety and define healthier dietary habits.  aPublisher supplied data 3afoods 3anutritional status 3ablood chemistry 3aepidemiology 3ahumans 3afree radicals 3ariboflavin 3ageographical variation 3ahealth promotion 3adisease prevention 3aurban areas 3aselenium 3asmoking (habit) 3acarotenoids 3aoxidation 3anervous system diseases 2aAdult 2aDisease Outbreaksxprevention & control 2aFeeding Behaviorxphysiology. 2aHumans 2aMale 2aMiddle Aged 2aNutritional Statusxphysiology 2aOptic Nerve Diseasesxepidemiologyxprevention & control. 2aPeripheral Nervous System Diseasesxepidemiologyxprevention & control. 2aProspective Studies 2aReference Values 2aSmokingxadverse effects 2aUrban Health 3aCuba 0aCubaxepidemiology. 0aoutbreaks 0ainhibitors1 aBarrios, Tomás Verdura1 aChassagne, Michelle1 aCristiá, Rafael Pérez1 aArnaud, Josiane1 aMestre, Pedro Fleites1 aMontoya, María Esther1 aFavier, Alain0 tInternational journal for vitamin and nutrition research.g2001 Sept. 1, v. 71, no. 5 p.274-285dVerlag Hans Huberx0300-98317nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1024/0300-9831.71.5.2743Available from publisher's Web site  a20020903b20020909c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US  mNon-PubAg articles 7aarticle03013naa a2200757 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003600111040001800147100002200165245009400187300001600281500001500297520071200312592002801024650002601052650001601078650001201094650001001106650002601116650001401142650001301156650002201169650001501191650001801206650001101224650002801235650000901263650002001272650001401292650002501306650003701331650001201368650005201380650006101432650003201493650003301525650003801558650002201596650000901618650001301627650002901640650000901669650002501678650001701703650001201720650004201732653001201774653002101786653003301807653002001840653001201860700001901872700002001891700002201911773013501933852000902068856008602077930003302163945001302196946001102209990002302220655001202243IND2321638020221117200348.0010619e20010301sz |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232163802DNAL7 a113391102pmid7 a10.1024/0300-9831.71.2.1282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGonzález, Marta,10aDietary Effects of Marine Food Intake on Intestinal and Hepatic Enzyme Activities in Rats  ap. 128-132.  a2019-12-04  aDietary effects of two diets high in protein from two marine species (Haliotis tuberculata and Anemonia viridis) as compared to a high-quality patron protein such as casein (or casein supplemented with olive oil) on intestinal and hepatic enzymes were studied.

The authors report that the depiction of female gamblers is very different from that of male gamblers in the movies made in the same period. Whereas the male gamblers are pitching a lonely and desperate battle against an evil opponent, the female gamblers portrayed in the movies are housewives or small-time players who gamble only for their personal gain. A generally negative overtone in portrayals of female gamblers was interpreted as a reflection of the traditional view that discourages women from gambling. The shift of gambling themes in the Hong Kong movies has been identified to reflect the most salient concerns among Hong Kong residents. Such changes are attributed to particular social and cultural changes in the community. 0aCultural influence on gambling 0aFemale gamblers portrayed in Hong Kong movies 0aSex differences in gambling behaviour 0aMedia and gambling1 aChan, Chi Chuen 0 tInternational journal of mental health and addiction.g2009 Jan., v. 7, no. 1 p.229-238dNew York : Springer-Verlagx1557-18747nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11469-008-9180-23Available from publisher's Web site  a20090220b20090301c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle01996naa a2200313 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002100145245007800166300001600244500002800260520101100288650002601299650001101325650001101336650001501347650001001362653002201372700002101394700002101415773012901436852000901565856008501574946001101659655001201670IND4414397020221117200145.0090102s2009    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441439702DNAL7 a10.1007/s11250-008-9175-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCeylan, Ebubekir14aThe occurrence and antibiotic resistance of motile Aeromonas in livestock  ap. 199-204.  aPublisher supplied data  aThe present study was carried out to assess the prevalence of motile Aeromonas spp. in the faeces of clinically healthy sheep, cattle and horses and evaluate their susceptibility to some anti-microbial agents.

Identification and antibiotic resistance of motile Aeromonas strains was performed using Gram Negative Enteric ID panel. Motile aeromonads were isolated from 12 (10%) sheep, 7 (8.2%) cattle and 1 (5%) horse. Of these 20 aeromonad isolates, 13 were A. caviae, 6 were A.sobria and 1 was A. hydrophila. Aeromonas species in the faeces of livestock might pose a public health problem for humans who are in direct contact with contaminated animals.

The study is to investigate the prevention efficacy of KH902 on experimental choroidal neovascularization (CNV) in a monkey model. Materials and Methods Binding assay and endothelial cell proliferation assay were used to evaluate activity and bioactivity of KH902 in vitro while an initial comparison of bioactivity was made between KH902 and Ranizumab (Lucentis). Ocular and systemic levels of KH902 were analyzed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) method after single intravitreal administration to evaluate its availability to ocular fundus. In vivo pharmacological study, CNV was induced by laser in monkeys and KH902 prevention efficacy on CNV was evaluated by incidence of CNV and several ophthalmic examinations. Results KH902 is a unique fusion protein with high affinity to VEGF and good availability to target tissue, beneficial to good bioactivity in vivo. In vivo pharmacological study, the incidence of CNV formation was largely reduced in KH902 treatment groups. Furthermore, the leakage of CNV in control group which crossed over to KH902 treatment 40 days after laser was much less than that before KH902 treatment. Conclusion KH902 was effective to prevent the formation of experimental CNV and also to treat pre-existed CNV without evidence of toxicity. This study suggests that KH902 has promise as a local anti-angiogenic treatment of CNV-related diseases. 0aage-related macular degeneration 0aantiangiogenesis 0achoroidal neovascularization 0aintravitreal injection 0avascular endothelial growth factor receptor1 aYu, Dechao 1 aYang, Chun 1 aXia, Qingjie 1 aLi, Wang 1 aLiu, Bin 1 aLi, Hong 0 tPharmaceutical research.g2009 Jan., v. 26, no. 1 p.204-210dBoston : Springer USx0724-87417nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11095-008-9718-93Available from publisher's Web site  a20081219b20090206c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle03034naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002000152245012300172300001600295520157800311650001701889650001401906650002201920650001101942650003701953650002301990650001102013650001902024650001702043650002402060650001202084650001202096651001402108653002202122653002602144653001602170653001502186700002102201700002202222700002102244700002002265773012202285852000902407856009202416930003302508946001102541655001202552IND4419226420221117200301.0090417e200905  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441922642DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1442-9993.2009.01932.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKROSCH, MATT N.10aDeeply divergent mitochondrial lineages reveal patterns of local endemism in chironomids of the Australian Wet Tropics  ap. 317-328.  aThe Wet Tropics bioregion of north-eastern Australia has been subject to extensive fluctuations in climate throughout the late Pliocene and Pleistocene. Cycles of rainforest contraction and expansion of dry sclerophyll forest associated with such climatic fluctuations are postulated to have played a major role in driving geographical endemism in terrestrial rainforest taxa. Consequences for the distributions of aquatic organisms, however, are poorly understood. The Australian non-biting midge species Echinocladius martini Cranston (Diptera: Chironomidae), although restricted to cool, well-forested freshwater streams, has been considered to be able to disperse among populations located in isolated rainforest pockets during periods of sclerophyllous forest expansion, potentially limiting the effect of climatic fluctuations on patterns of endemism. In this study, mitochondrial COI and 16S data were analysed for E. martini collected from eight sites spanning the Wet Tropics bioregion to assess the scale and extent of phylogeographic structure. Analyses of genetic structure showed several highly divergent cryptic lineages with restricted geographical distributions. Within one of the identified lineages, strong genetic structure implied that dispersal among proximate (<1 km apart) streams was extremely restricted. The results suggest that vicariant processes, most likely due to the systemic drying of the Australian continent during the Plio-Pleistocene, might have fragmented historical E. martini populations and, hence, promoted divergence in allopatry. 3aChironomidae 3aallopatry 3aaquatic organisms 3adrying 3agenetic techniques and protocols 3aindigenous species 3amidges 3aphylogeography 3arain forests 3asclerophyll forests 3astreams 3atropics 3aAustralia 0acryptic diversity 0aEchinocladius martini 0apleistocene 0avicariance1 aBAKER, ANDREW M.1 aMCKIE, BRENDAN G.1 aMATHER, PETER B.1 aCranston, P.

To isolate and identify the induced bacteria and to localize the strains in tissues of in vitro-grown potato plantlets. The inoculation of in vitro-grown potato plants with Pseudomonas fluorescens IMBG163 led to induction of another bacterium, a pink-pigmented facultative methylotroph that was identified as Methylobacterium sp. using phylogenetic 16S rDNA approach. Two molecular methods were used for localizing methylobacteria in potato plantlets: PCR and in situ hybridization (ISH/FISH). A PCR product specific for the Methylobacterium genus was found in DNA isolated from the surface-sterilized plantlet leaves. Presence of Methylobacterium rRNA was detected by ISH/FISH in leaves and stems of inoculated as well as axenic potato plantlets although the bacterium cannot be isolated from the axenic plants. Methylobacterium sp. resides in unculturable state within tissues of in vitro-grown potato plants and becomes culturable after inoculation with P. fluorescens IMBG163. In order to develop endophytic biofertilizers and biocontrol agents, a detailed knowledge of the life-style of endophytes is essential. To our knowledge, this is the first report on increase of the culturability of endophytes in response to inoculation by nonpathogenic bacteria. 3aMethylobacterium 0aendophytic bacteria 0apotato plantlets 0aunculturable1 aLaschevskyy, V.1 aOvcharenko, L.1 aKozyrovska, N.1 aPirttilä, A.M.0 tJournal of applied microbiology.g2009 Mar., v. 106, no. 3 p.728-737dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx1364-50727nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2672.2008.03951.x3Available from publisher's Web site  aNon-US 7aarticle02383naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001400145245004600159300001600205520142800221650001601649650001501665653002001680653001901700653001501719700001701734700001801751700001801769700001601787773010401803852000901907856008501916930003302001946001102034655001202045IND4413192320221117200712.0081128e200811  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441319232DNAL7 a10.1007/s00292-008-1023-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGroh, A. 10aMathematical modelling in systems biology  ap. 135-140.  aA mathematical model of collagen fiber mesh formation was created to evaluate the possible role of chemotaxis and haptotaxis in the histomorphology of a desmoplastic stromal reaction (DSR). Fibroblasts were mathematicaly interpreted as mobile discrete objects, characterized by their velocity and position, both dependent on time. This resulted in cell migration paths, commonly termed “trajectories” which are modulated as stochastic process. The implementation of chemotactic effects requires knowledge of the concentration and distribution of the appropriate chemical substance in the scenario. A simplistic model assumption allows the calculation of a numerical solution of the resulting diffusion equation. Adding haptotaxis necessitates the simulation of the extracellular matrix (ECM). The fiber distribution is modeled as a vector field which contains information on both, fiber density and direction. The production of new fibers is based on ordinary differential equations coupled with the migratory behavior of the cells. Filters help smooth the trajectories. Appropriate visualization allows a direct comparison of the simulation results with histomorphology. Matches between computed data and their real counterparts indicate that the development of mathematical models is appropriate to describe and forecast the course of DSR. This makes systems biology a stepping stone to improving biomedical research. 3afibroblasts 3achemotaxis 0aSystems biology 0aCell migration 0aHaptotaxis1 aLouis, A.K. 1 aWeichert, F. 1 aRichards, T. 1 aWagner, M. 0 tPathologe.g2008 Nov., v. 29, no. 2 p.135-140dBerlin/Heidelberg : Springer-Verlagx0172-81137nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00292-008-1023-13Available from publisher's Web site  a20081128b20081206c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02281naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092024002200134024001900156040001800175100001800193245013000211300001800341520100400359653001601363653001401379653000801393653001301401653001501414700001901429700002001448700001901468700001701487700002601504700001901530700002301549700001901572700001701591773010601608852000901714856009201723930003301815946001101848655001201859IND4411157020221117200730.0081010e200811  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441115702DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1600-0854.2008.00805.x2doi7 aPMC28202802pmcid7 a187648192pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMaday, Sandra12aA PDZ-Binding Motif Controls Basolateral Targeting of Syndecan-1 Along the Biosynthetic Pathway in Polarized Epithelial Cells  ap. 1915-1924.  aThe cell surface proteoglycan, syndecan-1, is essential for normal epithelial morphology and function. Syndecan-1 is selectively localized to the basolateral domain of polarized epithelial cells and interacts with cytosolic PDZ (PSD-95, discs large, ZO-1) domain-containing proteins. Here, we show that the polarity of syndecan-1 is determined by its type II PDZ-binding motif. Mutations within the PDZ-binding motif lead to the mislocalization of syndecan-1 to the apical surface. In contrast to previous examples, however, PDZ-binding motif-dependent polarity is not determined by retention at the basolateral surface but rather by polarized sorting prior to syndecan-1's arrival at the plasma membrane. Although none of the four known PDZ-binding partners of syndecan-1 appears to control basolateral localization, our results show that the PDZ-binding motif of syndecan-1 is decoded along the biosynthetic pathway establishing a potential role for PDZ-mediated interactions in polarized sorting. 0abasolateral 0aepithelia 0aPDZ 0apolarity 0asyndecan-11 aAnderson, Eric1 aChang, Henry C.1 aShorter, James1 aSatoh, Ayano1 aSfakianos, Jeffrey N.1 aFölsch, Heike1 aAnderson, James M.1 aWalther, Zenta1 aMellman, Ira0 tTraffic.g2008 Nov., v. 9, no. 11 p.1915-1924dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx1398-92197nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1600-0854.2008.00805.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20081010b20081101c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02455naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002400152245014700176300001800323520114700341650002401488650001401512650001201526650001501538650001101553650001401564651000901578651001701587651001301604653001701617653002501634653001401659653002201673700002301695700001801718700002501736773012701761852000901888856009201897930003301989946001102022655001202033IND4411133520221117200755.0081010e200810  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441113352DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1444-2906.2008.01621.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMITAMURA, Hiromichi10aMovements of immature hatchery-reared Mekong giant catfish Pangasianodon gigas released in the Mekong River, measured using acoustic telemetry  ap. 1034-1039.  aTwenty-eight immature hatchery-reared Mekong giant catfish Pangasianodon gigas tagged with acoustic transmitters were released in the Mekong River, Thailand from 2002 to 2004. Twenty-four and four fish were tagged with normal transmitters and pressure-sensitive transmitters, respectively. Five to seven automated monitoring receivers were used for monitoring the post-release movements. The tagged catfish could be detected for up to 97 days, the first detection taking place at the release point, where the fish remained for several days. Sixteen tagged fish (57%) were not detected at any later point. These fish may have passed along the opposite (Laos) side of the river without notice because the width of the river was larger than the detection range of the transmitter. The remaining 12 tagged fish (43%) could be detected by the receivers installed, excluding the release point receiver. Of these 12 tagged fish, six showed long-distance (30-80 km) upstream movements and one long-distance (50 km) downstream movement. These seven fish (25%) were detected only during the daytime, suggesting that the Mekong giant catfish is diurnal. 3aPangasianodon gigas 3aacoustics 3acatfish 3amonitoring 3arivers 3atelemetry 3aLaos 3aMekong River 3aThailand 0aconservation 0ahatchery-reared fish 0amigration 0avertical movement1 aMITSUNAGA, Yasushi1 aARAI, Nobuaki1 aVIPUTHANUMAS, Thavee0 tFisheries science.g2008 Oct., v. 74, no. 5 p.1034-1039dMelbourne, Australia : Blackwell Publishing Asiax0919-92687nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1444-2906.2008.01621.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20081010b20081101c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02854naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002000145245010700165300001600272500001500288520125500303650001501558650001701573650002201590650001001612650002201622650002001644650004301664650003101707650001501738650002901753650001201782650001301794650003901807650001101846653002401857653002701881653002701908653001801935653002101953653001401974700002301988700002302011700002402034700001902058773010902077852000902186856008502195930003302280946001102313655001202324IND4418675720221117200723.0090404e200904  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441867572DNAL7 a10.1007/s11104-008-9799-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNogales, Amaia 10aResponse of mycorrhizal grapevine to Armillaria mellea inoculation: disease development and polyamines  ap. 177-187.  a2019-12-04  aA study was conducted with the vine rootstock Richter 110 (Vitis berlandieri Planch. x Vitis rupestris L.) in order to assess whether the colonisation by the arbuscular mycorrhizal fungus (AMF) Glomus intraradices (BEG 72) can delay the disease development in plants inoculated with the root-rot fungus Armillaria mellea (Vahl:Fr) Kummer, and to elucidate if the levels of polyamines (PAs) are modified in response to G. intraradices, A. mellea or by the dual infection. Four treatments were considered: control and G. intraradices-inoculated plants infected or not with A. mellea. Plant growth, mycorrhizal colonisation and disease development were monitored throughout the experiment. High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) in combination with fluorescence spectrophotometry was used to separate and quantify free root and leaf polyamines. The slower development of pathogenic symptoms and the higher plant biomass of mycorrhizal plants inoculated with A. mellea indicate an increase of tolerance due to the AMF inoculation. The variations in free PA levels detected at the beginning of the pathogenic infection suggest that PAs may have a potential role in the signalling mechanisms of the tolerance of mycorrhizal plants against A. mellea. 3apolyamines 3aplant growth 3aArmillaria mellea 3avines 3amycorrhizal fungi 3aVitis rupestris 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3aVitis cinerea var. helleri 3arootstocks 3aRhizophagus intraradices 3abiomass 3aroot rot 3afluorescence emission spectroscopy 3aleaves 0aGlomus intraradices 0aArbuscular mycorrhizae 0aWhite root rot disease 0aBioprotection 0aStress-tolerance 0aGrapevine1 aAguirreolea, Jone 1 aSanta María, Eva 1 aCamprubí, Amèlia 1 aCalvet, Cinta 0 tPlant and soil.g2009 Apr., v. 317, no. 1-2 p.177-187dDordrecht : Springer Netherlandsx0032-079X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11104-008-9799-63Available from publisher's Web site  a20090404b20090508c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03476naa a2200625 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146072001700164100001600181245006700197300001400264520149600278592002801774650001001802650001501812650002101827650002001848650002801868650002301896650002001919650002301939650003301962650001101995650002402006650002002030650001702050650003102067650002402098650001102122650006202133650002402195650001102219650003702230650004102267650004202308650002402350650003602374653003102410700001702441700001802458700002202476700002102498773013302519852000902652856008502661930003302746945002502779946001102804990002302815655001202838IND4394960120221117200143.0070912e20070101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439496012DNAL7 a176850972pmid7 a10.1024/0300-9831.77.1.662doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aMcEneny,  J10aFolate: In Vitro and in Vivo Effects on VLDL and LDL Oxidation  ap. 66-72.  aRaised total homocysteine (tHcy) levels may be involved in the etiology of cardiovascular disease and can lead to damage of vascular endothelial cells and arterial wall matrix. Folic acid supplementation can help negate these detrimental effects by reducing tHcy. Recent evidence has suggested an additional anti-atherogenic property of folate in protecting lipoproteins against oxidation. This study utilized both an in vitro and in vivo approach. In vitro: Very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) and low density lipoprotein (LDL) were isolated by rapid ultracentrifugation and then oxidized in the presence of increasing concentrations (0→ μmol/L) of either folic acid or 5-methyltetrahydrofolate (5-MTHF). In vivo: Twelve female subjects were supplemented with folic acid (1 mg/day), and the pre- and post-VLDL and LDL isolates subjected to oxidation. In vitro: 5-MTHF, but not folic acid, significantly increased the resistance of VLDL and LDL to oxidation. In vivo: Following folic acid supplementation, tHcy decreased, serum folate increased, and both VLDL and LDL displayed a significant increase in their resistance to oxidation. These results indicated that in vitro, only the active form of folate, 5-MTHF, had antioxidant properties. In vivo results demonstrated that folic acid supplementation reduced tHcy and protected both VLDL and LDL against oxidation. These findings provide further support for the use of folic acid supplements to aid in the prevention of atherosclerosis.  aPublisher supplied data 3awomen 3afolic acid 3ain vitro studies 3ain vivo studies 3alow density lipoprotein 3alipid peroxidation 3aatherosclerosis 3adisease prevention 3avery low density lipoprotein 3adosage 3adietary supplements 3ablood chemistry 3ahomocysteine 2aAntioxidantsxpharmacology 2aDietary Supplements 2aFemale 2aFolic Acidxadministration & dosagexbloodxpharmacology. 2aHomocysteinexblood 2aHumans 2aLipid Peroxidationxdrug effects 2aLipoproteins, LDLxbloodxchemistry. 2aLipoproteins, VLDLxbloodxchemistry. 2aOxidation-Reduction 2aTetrahydrofolatesxpharmacology 0aantiatherogenic properties1 aCouston,  C.1 aMcKibben,  B.1 aYoung, Isador S.,1 aWoodside,  J.

  1 aChaturvedi,  P.10aProtective Role of Raphanus Sativus Root Extract on Paracetamol-Induced Hepatotoxicity in Albino Rats  ap. 41-45.  aThe methanol extract of Raphanus sativus root extract showed a protective effect on paracetamol-induced hepatotoxicity in a dose-dependent manner. Degree of lipid peroxidation caused by paracetamol was measured in terms of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) and protection was measured in reference to serum glutamate oxaloacetate transaminase (SGOT), serum glutamate aspartate transaminase (SGPT), and blood and hepatic levels of antioxidants like glutathione and catalase. Administration of extract along with paracetamol showed significant protection. Levels of TBARS were found to be low, activities of SGOT and SGPT were low, while hepatic glutathione levels were significantly higher in experimental rats that received the mixture of paracetamol and the extract as compared to rats that received paracetamol only. Activities of catalase were also high in all experimental groups.

  1 aHuang, Zhaoxiong,10aEffects of Lycopene Supplementation on Plasma and Tissue Lycopene Levels in Various Rodent Strains  ap. 377-384.  a2019-12-04  aLycopene has been shown to have various biologic effects, and rats and mice are often used for elucidating its in vivo effects and mechanisms. Here, we compared plasma and tissue lycopene levels in F344 rats, BALB/c mice, nude mice, and gerbils by oral supplementation with lycopene (20 mg/kg BW · 2d) every other morning for 10 days. We found that livers accumulated substantially more lycopene than kidneys and that the hepatic lycopene contents varied greatly in these animals, with gerbils being most efficient (1432 ± 235 nmol/g), followed by nude mice (524 ± 133 nmol/g), F344 rats (28 ± 11 nmol/g), and BALB/c mice (5 ± 2 nmol/g). Plasma lycopene concentrations also varied greatly, of which the highest was found in gerbils (667 ± 160 nmol/L), followed by nude mice (224 ± 51 nmol/L), then by BALB/c mice and F344 rats (198 ± 52 and 139 ± 41 nmol/L, respectively). Interestingly, plasma and tissue β-carotene concentrations in these animals were markedly decreased by lycopene supplementation. To determine the steady-state levels of plasma lycopene, we fed 10 gerbils with lycopene (20 mg/kg BW · 2d) for 20 days, and we found a steady-state level of plasma lycopene between 597 to 722 nmol/L. Our results demonstrate that gerbils and nude mice are better accumulators than F344 rats and BALB/c mice, and that the former species may be more useful for studying the in vivo effects of lycopene.  aPublisher supplied data 3aliver 3ablood chemistry 3adose response 3abioaccumulation 3astrain differences 3ablood plasma 3alycopene 3aMeriones unguiculatus 3amice 3abeta-carotene 3adosage 3aanimal models 3ahuman nutrition 3akidneys 3arats 3aoral administration 3adietary supplements 2aAnalysis of Variance 2aAnimals 2aBody Weightxdrug effects 2aCarotenoidsxbloodxmetabolismxpharmacology. 2aDietary Supplements 2aGerbillinae 2aKidneyxmetabolism 2aLiverxmetabolism 2aMale 2aMice 2aMice, Inbred BALB C 2aMice, Nude 2aModels, Animal 2aRats 2aRats, Inbred F344 2aSpecies Specificity 2aTime Factors 2abeta Carotenexbloodxmetabolism. 0astrains1 aChuang,  C.

  1 aEsmaillzadeh, Ahmad10aCholesterol-Lowering Effect of Concentrated Pomegranate Juice Consumption in Type II Diabetic Patients with Hyperlipidemia  ap. 147-151.  a2019-12-04  aThis study was undertaken to assess the effect of concentrated pomegranate juice consumption on lipid profiles of type II diabetic patients with hyperlipidemia (total cholesterol or triglycerides ≥ 200 mg/dL). In this pilot study 22 diabetic patients were recruited from the Iranian Diabetes Society. They were free of any other chronic diseases. The patients were followed for eight weeks to obtain more detailed data about their diet before concentrated pomegranate juice (CPJ) consumption period began. In this pre-study period a 24-hour food recall and a food record (containing flavonoid-rich foodstuffs) were completed every ten days. At the end of the eighth week, anthropometric and biochemical assessments were done. Thereafter the patients consumed 40 g CPJ for eight weeks. During this period, dietary assessment was continued. After completion of the study anthropometric and blood indices were evaluated again. The Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used for statistical analysis. P-value was considered significant at p < 0.05. There were 14 women (63.6%) and 8 men (36.4%) in this survey. Mean (± SD) of age, weight, and duration of diabetes were 52.5 (± 5.2) years, 71.5 (± 10.3) kg, and 7.9 (± 6.6) years, respectively. After consumption of concentrated pomegranate juice significant reductions were seen in total cholesterol (p < 0.006), low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-c) (p < 0.006), LDL-c/high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-c) (p < 0.001), and total cholesterol/HDL-c (p < 0.001). However there were no significant changes in serum triacylglycerol and HDL-c concentrations. Anthropometric indices, physical activity level, types and doses of oral hypoglycemic agents, and the intake of nutrients and flavonoid-rich foodstuffs did not change during the CPJ consumption period. It is concluded that CPJ consumption could modify heart disease risk factors in these hyperlipidemic patients. Therefore, its inclusion in their diets may be beneficial.  aPublisher supplied data 3ahyperlipidemia 3aage 3anoninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus 3adietary supplements 3adiet recall 3aadults 3ajuice concentrates 3anutrient intake 3awomen 3apatients 3ablood lipids 3amen 3aanthropometric measurements 3abody weight 3aphysical activity 3atriacylglycerols 3ahigh density lipoprotein 3afood intake 3apomegranates 3adosage 3acholesterol 3alow density lipoprotein 3afruit juices 2aAnticholesteremic Agentsxtherapeutic use 2aBeverages 2aBiomarkersxblood. 2aCholesterol, HDLxbloodxdrug effects. 2aCholesterol, LDLxbloodxdrug effects. 2aDiabetes Mellitus, Type 2xcomplicationsxdrug therapyxepidemiology. 2aDiet Records 2aFemale 2aFlavonoidsxadministration & dosage 2aHumans 2aHyperlipidemiasxbloodxcomplicationsxdrug therapyxepidemiology. 2aHypoglycemic Agentsxtherapeutic use 2aMale 2aMiddle Aged 2aNutrition Assessment 2aPhytotherapy 2aPilot Projects 2aPlant Preparations 2aLythraceae. 2aRegression Analysis 2aStatistics, Nonparametric 2aTreatment Outcome 2aTriglyceridesxblood 3aIran 0aIranxepidemiology. 0adiet 0apomegranate juice1 aTahbaz, Farideh1 aGaieni, Iraj1 aAlavi-Majd, Hamid1 aAzadbakht, Leila0 tInternational journal for vitamin and nutrition research.g2006 May 1, v. 76, no. 3 p.147-151dVerlag Hans Huberx0300-98317nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1024/0300-9831.76.3.1473Available from publisher's Web site  a20070611b20070702c00000000  aINDd2CTe2007/05/17  aNon-US  mNon-PubAg articles 7aarticle05571naa a2200889 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003600111040001800147072001700165072001700182072001700199100002100216245013900237300001600376500001500392520297500407592002803382650002003410650001603430650002303446650000803469650001803477650001303495650002603508650000903534650001503543650001403558650001503572650000803587650001703595650002703612650002003639650001003659650002003669650001003689650002503699650003503724650001703759650002203776650002003798650002503818650002803843650001103871650001803882650002403900650002103924650001503945650002803960650001103988650002603999650000904025650001604034650002504050650003204075650004404107650002804151651000904179651002404188653001904212653002604231653000904257653001704266700002504283700001804308700002204326773013404348852000904482856008604491930003304577945002504610946001104635990002304646655001204669IND4389151820221117200139.0070319e20060501xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438915182DNAL7 a170481922pmid7 a10.1024/0300-9831.76.3.1322doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aDjalali, Mahmoud14aThe Effect of Repeated Blood Donations on the Iron Status of Iranian Blood Donors Attending the Iranian Blood Transfusion Organization  ap. 132-137.  a2019-12-04  aObjective: Blood donation leads to substantial iron loss, as about 0.5 mg iron is lost per each milliliter of blood donated. If not compensated for efficiently, the iron loss may eventually lead to anemia, though non-anemic iron deficiency per se may be problematic. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of blood donation, and its frequency over a year’s time, on iron status of Iranian male blood donors attended blood transfusion stations of the Iranian Blood Transfusion Organization (IBTO). Design and setting: A cross-sectional, descriptive, and analytic study was conducted. 91 male volunteer blood donors aged from 20 to 50 years attending three IBTO stations located in central areas of Tehran, and 63 apparently healthy controls that were matched for age, gender, monthly income, height, and weight, were included in the study. Blood donors were divided into 4 groups according to the frequency of blood donation per year; i.e. 1, 2, 3, and 4 with 20, 30, 26, and 15 persons in each group, respectively. Just before blood donation, 10 mL venous blood sample was taken and divided into heparinized and non-heparinized tubes for determination of hemoglobin (Hb), hematocrit (Hct), serum iron (SI), total iron binding capacity (TIBC), ferritin, transferrin saturation (TS), and mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC). Dietary assessment was also done using 3 different questionnaires; i.e. general health, food frequency, and 24hr recall. Results: The levels of Hb, Hct, and iron status indices were all significantly lower in the subjects than in controls and a gradual but significant decrease in iron status indices in each time of blood donation was found. Serum ferritin showed significant correlations with age (r = 0.33, p < 0.001) and body-mass index (BMI) (r = 0.26, p = 0.03) only in the control group. Frequency of blood donation per year was also inversely correlated with Hb (r = -0.67, p < 0.001), Hct (r = -0.65, p < 0.001), MCHC (r = -0.56, p < 0.001), serum ferritin (r = -0.38, p < 0.001), SI (r = -0.62, p < 0.001), and TS (r = -0.61, p < 0.001), but was directly correlated with TIBC (r = 0.56, p < 0.001). Interestingly in blood donors, but not in healthy controls, serum ferritin levels showed weak but statistically significant correlations with daily intake of iron (r = 0.17, p < 0.05) and energy (r = 0.20, p = 0.03). Conclusion: Though repeated blood donations might diminish iron status, it could be safe to donate 2–3 U/year without an appreciable incidence of iron deficiency, provided that the pre-donation Hb and ferritin values are ≥ 14.7 g/dL and 58.9 μg/L, respectively. The male volunteers with Hb ≥ 14.2 g/dL and serum ferritin ≥ 57.2 μg/L could donate 1–2 U/year and those with Hb ≥ 13.1 g/dL and serum ferritin ≥ 35.3 μg/L could donate just once a year. Volunteers who undergo (repeated) blood donation should receive special nutritional care, especially in terms of iron and energy.  aPublisher supplied data 3anutrient intake 3atransferrin 3anutritional status 3amen 3aenergy intake 3aferritin 3anutrient deficiencies 3airon 3ahemoglobin 3afrequency 3ahematocrit 3aage 3ablood volume 3airon deficiency anemia 3abody mass index 3ablood 3adietary surveys 2aAdult 2aAnalysis of Variance 2aAnemia, Iron-Deficiencyxblood 2aBlood Donors 2aBlood Transfusion 2aBody Mass Index 2aCase-Control Studies 2aCross-Sectional Studies 2aEating 2aEnergy Intake 2aErythrocyte Indices 2aFerritinsxblood 2aHematocrit 2aHemoglobinsxmetabolism 2aHumans 2aIron Compoundsxblood 2aMale 2aMiddle Aged 2aNutrition Assessment 2aSurveys and Questionnaires. 2aTrace Elementsxadministration & dosage 2aTransferrinxmetabolism 3aIran 0aIranxepidemiology. 0ablood donation 0airon-binding capacity 0adiet 0ablood donors1 aNeyestani, Tirang R.1 aBateni, Jamil1 aSiassi, Fereydoun0 tInternational journal for vitamin and nutrition research.g2006 May 1, v. 76, no. 3 p.132-137dVerlag Hans Huberx0300-98317nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1024/0300-9831.76.3.1323Available from publisher's Web site  a20070611b20070702c00000000  aINDd2CTe2007/05/17  aNon-US  mNon-PubAg articles 7aarticle03731naa a2200781 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003600111040001800147072001700165072001700182100003100199245008700230300001600317520142100333592002801754650001201782650002201794650002001816650001701836650001301853650000801866650001001874650001301884650002301897650001801920650001101938650001501949650002201964650001101986650001801997650002002015650001302035650000902048650002202057650001002079650004202089650004302131650002702174650003802201650001702239650001102256650003402267650001102301650003602312650000902348650001502357650002102372650003002393650004202423650001602465651002502481700001902506700002702525700001802552700002002570700002502590773013502615852000902750856008602759930003302845945002502878946001102903990002302914655001202937IND4390717320221117200149.0070430e20061101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439071732DNAL7 a176079552pmid7 a10.1024/0300-9831.76.6.3592doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aRodríguez-Rodríguez,  E.14aThe Relationship Between Antioxidant Nutrient Intake and Cataracts in Older People  ap. 359-366.  aThis study investigated the relationship between the intake of antioxidant nutrients and the suffering of cataracts in 177 institutionalized elderly people (61 men and 116 women) aged ≥ 65 years. Dietary intake was monitored for 7 consecutive days using a "precise individual weighing" method. Subjects, who during their earlier years were exposed by their work to sunlight, had a greater risk of suffering cataracts (OR = 3.2; Cl: 1.1–9.3, P < 0.05) than those who worked indoors. A relationship was found between increased vitamin C intake and a reduced prevalence of cataracts (i.e., when comparing those above P<sub>95</sub> for vitamin C intake with those below P<sub>5</sub>; (OR = 0.08; Cl: 0.01–0.75, P 0.05). Among subjects with cataracts, 12.1% had vitamin C intakes of < 61 mg/day (P<sub>10</sub>) and only 2.2% had intakes of > 183 mg/day (P<sub>95</sub>) (p < 0.01). Subjects who consumed > 3290 μg/day (P<sub>95</sub>) of lutein were less likely to have cataracts (OR = 0.086; Cl: 0.007–1.084; p < 0.05) than those whose consumption was < 256 μg/day (P<sub>5</sub>). In men, high intakes of zeaxanthin seemed to provide a protective effect against the problem (OR = 0.96; Cl: 0.91–0.99; p < 0.05). The results suggest an association exists between exposure to sunlight and the development of cataracts, and that vitamin C, lutein, and zeaxanthin offer some protection against this disorder.  aPublisher supplied data 3aelderly 3aelderly nutrition 3anutrient intake 3aantioxidants 3acataract 3amen 3awomen 3apatients 3adisease prevalence 3aascorbic acid 3alutein 3azeaxanthin 3aprotective effect 3adosage 3adose response 3asolar radiation 3aetiology 2aAged 2aAged, 80 and over 2aAging 2aAntioxidantsxadministration & dosage 2aAscorbic Acidxadministration & dosage 2aCataractxepidemiology 2aDietxstatistics & numerical data 2aDiet Surveys 2aFemale 2aGeriatric Assessmentxmethods 2aHumans 2aLuteinxadministration & dosage 2aMale 2aOdds Ratio 2aSex Distribution 2aSunlightxadverse effects 2aXanthophyllsxadministration & dosage 2aZeaxanthins 0aSpainxepidemiology.1 aOrtega,  R.

Male Wistar rats were randomized by weight into three groups, and fed a control diet (control group), a Mg-deficient diet (Mg<sup>-</sup> group) or a Mg-deficient diet having twice the control Ca concentrations (Mg<sup>-</sup>2Ca group) for 14 days. Trabecular bone volume was significantly lower in the Mg <sup>-</sup> and Mg<sup>-</sup>2Ca groups than in the control group. Trabecular number was also significantly lower in the Mg <sup>-</sup> and Mg<sup>-</sup>2Ca groups than in the control group. Mineralizing bone surface, mineral apposition rate (MAR), and surface referent bone formation rate (BFR/BS) were significantly lower in the Mg <sup>-</sup> and Mg<sup>-</sup>2Ca groups than in the control group. Furthermore, MAR and BFR/BS were significantly lower in the Mg<sup>-</sup>2Ca group than in the Mg <sup>-</sup> group. These results suggest that dietary Ca supplementation suppresses bone formation in Mg-deficient rats.  aPublisher supplied data 3anutrient-nutrient interactions 3acalcium 3anutrient deficiencies 3abone mineralization 3amagnesium 3arats 3adietary minerals 3adietary mineral supplements 2aAnalysis of Variance 2aAnimals 2aBody Weightxdrug effects 2aBone Densityxdrug effects 2aBone Density Conservation Agentsxadministration & dosage 2aBone Developmentxdrug effects 2aBone Remodelingxdrug effects 2aCalcium, Dietaryxadministration & dosagexmetabolism. 2aDietary Supplements 2aDisease Models, Animal 2aEating 2aFemurxdrug effectsxmetabolismxpathology. 2aMagnesiumxadministration & dosagexmetabolism. 2aMagnesium Deficiencyxphysiopathology 2aMale 2aOsteoclastsxdrug effects 2aOsteogenesisxdrug effects 2aPhosphorus, Dietaryxadministration & dosagexmetabolism. 2aRats 2aRats, Wistar 0abone formation1 aMiwa, Misao0 tInternational journal for vitamin and nutrition research.g2006 May 1, v. 76, no. 3 p.111-116dVerlag Hans Huberx0300-98317nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1024/0300-9831.76.3.1113Available from publisher's Web site  a20070611b20070702c00000000  aINDd2CTe2007/05/17  aNon-US  mNon-PubAg articles 7aarticle02846naa a2200661 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003600111040001800147072001700165072001700182100001700199245009100216300001600307520091900323592002801242650001201270650001901282650002001301650001701321650001401338650002201352650001901374650001901393650002001412650001601432650000801448650001601456650002501472650002301497650001901520650001901539650002101558650002801579650001101607650001101618650001101629650002001640650000901660650002901669650002901698651002101727651002601748700002301774700001701797700001901814700001801833773013401851852000901985856008601994930003302080945002502113946001102138990002302149655001202172IND4389152120221117200210.0070319e20060501xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438915212DNAL7 a170481902pmid7 a10.1024/0300-9831.76.3.1172doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Blood samples were taken on Guthrie cards and plasma free carnitine levels were analyzed by tandem mass spectrometry. The mean free carnitine level was 25.12 ± 10.1 μmol/L (10.1–49.5 μmol/L). To assess the plasma free carnitine levels according to feeding style, babies were grouped as exclusively breastfed (n = 67, 49.3%), artificially fed (n = 24, 17.7%), and mixed fed (n = 45, 33%). The exclusively breastfed infants displayed the lowest free carnitine levels (p < 0.05). However, when this was analyzed in accordance with age, no significant change was observed in plasma free carnitine levels according to feeding style. Results of this study are important as they reveal an indication about the normal values of plasma free carnitine in Turkish infants and their relationship to feeding styles.  aPublisher supplied data 3ainfants 3ainfant feeding 3ablood chemistry 3ablood plasma 3acarnitine 3amass spectrometry 3abreast feeding 3abottle feeding 3ainfant formulas 3abreast milk 3aage 2aAge Factors 2aAnalysis of Variance 2aBiomarkersxblood. 2aBottle Feeding 2aBreast Feeding 2aCarnitinexblood 2aCross-Sectional Studies 2aFemale 2aHumans 2aInfant 2aInfant, Newborn 2aMale 2aTandem Mass Spectrometry 2aVitamin B Complexxblood 3aTurkey (country) 0aTurkeyxepidemiology.1 aKiliç, Fatma Kaya1 aSanli, Cihat1 aCoskun, Turgay1 aÖnal, Saniye0 tInternational journal for vitamin and nutrition research.g2006 May 1, v. 76, no. 3 p.117-123dVerlag Hans Huberx0300-98317nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1024/0300-9831.76.3.1173Available from publisher's Web site  a20070611b20070702c00000000  aINDd2CTe2007/05/17  aNon-US  mNon-PubAg articles 7aarticle03886naa a2200901 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003600111040001800147072001700165072001700182100002300199245009500222300001600317500001500333520125200348592002801600650001701628650000801645650001001653650001801663650001301681650002401694650004301718650002301761650001201784650001201796650001601808650002301824650002001847650001101867650001001878650000901888650002301897650003001920650002001950650002801970650002801998650003702026650003802063650001902101650001102120650001602131650001102147650001902158650002302177650000902200650001602209650001902225650001502244650002102259650002002280650002302300650002502323650002002348651001302368651002802381653002002409653002102429700002902450700002802479700002302507700002602530700002202556700002202578700002402600700002702624773013402651852000902785856008602794930003302880945002502913946001102938990002302949655001202972IND4389152020221117200454.0070319e20060501xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438915202DNAL7 a170481912pmid7 a10.1024/0300-9831.76.3.1252doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Two groups had type II diabetes mellitus (DM): one group had been overnourished (DM/OB) (body mass index: BMI equal or above 25) and the other had not (DM/nOB). Two additional groups not suffering from diabetes were either overnourished (nDM/OB) or of normal nutritional status (nDM/nOB). Only the DM/OB group had insulin levels elevated above the other three groups. Resistin levels had been lowest in the nDM/nOB group. When participants of the two nOB groups were pooled into one group and the subjects of the two OB groups were combined into another group, the median plasma resistin levels of the OB groups were significantly higher compared with the nOB groups. Likewise the DM groups had higher resistin levels than the nDM groups. A significant correlation of plasma resistin with BMI, waist circumference, waist-to-hip ratio, FBS, and HOMA score had been observed. The result suggests that plasma resistin has a role in linking central obesity and obesity-related insulin resistance to type II diabetes mellitus.  aPublisher supplied data 3ablood lipids 3amen 3awomen 3ablood glucose 3aresistin 3awaist circumference 3anoninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus 3ainsulin resistance 3aobesity 3ainsulin 3ahomeostasis 3awaist-to-hip ratio 3abody mass index 3aadults 2aAdult 2aAged 2aBiomarkersxblood. 2aBlood Glucosexmetabolism 2aBody Mass Index 2aCholesterol, HDLxblood 2aCholesterol, LDLxblood 2aDiabetes Mellitus, Type 2xblood 2aEnzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay 2aFastingxblood 2aFemale 2aHomeostasis 2aHumans 2aInsulinxblood 2aInsulin Resistance 2aMale 2aMiddle Aged 2aObesityxblood 2aOverweight 2aRadioimmunoassay 2aResistinxblood 2aSkinfold Thickness 2aTriglyceridesxblood 2aWaist-Hip Ratio 3aThailand 0aThailandxepidemiology. 0ablood chemistry 0apeptide hormones1 aTungtrongchitr, Rungsunn1 aHarnroongroj, Talabporn1 aPhonrat, Benjaluck1 aRungseesakorn, Orapin1 aPaksanont, Suporn1 aPooudong, Somchai1 aSaowakontha, Sastri1 aVarongchayakul, Chusak0 tInternational journal for vitamin and nutrition research.g2006 May 1, v. 76, no. 3 p.125-131dVerlag Hans Huberx0300-98317nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1024/0300-9831.76.3.1253Available from publisher's Web site  a20070611b20070702c00000000  aINDd2CTe2007/05/17  aNon-US  mNon-PubAg articles 7aarticle03331naa a2200625 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003600111040001800147072001700165072001700182100001500199245005500214300001600269500012900285520138600414592002801800650001101828650001201839650002201851650001301873650003501886650002001921650002501941650001601966650001401982650001901996650001602015650003702031650002202068650000902090650001702099650001402116650001002130650001702140650001802157650000902175650003002184650004802214650003202262650001102294650002202305653002302327700002102350773013502371852000902506856008602515930003302601945002502634946001102659990002302670655001202693IND4389145420221117200345.0070319e20060701xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438914542DNAL7 a172430812pmid7 a10.1024/0300-9831.76.4.1842doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

However, the rising prevalence of obesity in developed and developing societies must reflect lifestyle changes. Despite that the genetic background remains stable over many generations, obesity may be derived from a failure on the homeostasis systems, as a consequence of a dysfunction at the genetic level, which may be affected by changing environmental exposure (dietary habits, sedentarism, etc). In practice, obesity risk at least depends on two important factors, which mutually interact: 1) genetic variants and gene expression changes in candidate genes and 2) exposure to environmental risk factors. Disagreements among studies involving gene-nutrient interactions may reflect the difficulty of accurate measurement of specific types of dietary macro and micronutrients intake as well of phenotype assessment rather than a discrepancy in biological relevance. Identification of individuals who are genetically more likely to respond to particular dietary changes may be important for successful intervention in obesity treatment, since gene screening will allow health professionals to tailor-design weight management and dietary guidance in individuals with a genetic predisposition to become obese.  aPublisher supplied data 3ahumans 3aobesity 3agenetic variation 3agenotype 3anutrition-genotype interaction 3agene expression 3agenetic polymorphism 3aweight gain 3alifestyle 3aenergy balance 3ahomeostasis 3agenotype-environment interaction 3aphysical activity 3adiet 3afood choices 3aphenotype 3agenes 3arisk factors 2aDietxmethods 2aFood 2aGene Expressionxgenetics 2aGenetic Predisposition to Diseasexgenetics 2aGenetic Variationxgenetics 2aHumans 2aObesityxgenetics 0aliterature reviews1 aMartinez, J.

Its antioxidant mechanism is not known. We investigated the ability of PPG to scavenge exogenously generated hydroxyl radicals (.OH) using a sensitive high pressure liquid chromatographic (HPLC) method. .OH was generated by photolysis of H2O2 (1.25-10 micromoles) with UV light and was trapped with salicylic acid (500 nmoles). Salicylic acid is hydroxylated to produce OH adduct products 2.3- and 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid (DHBA). H2O2 produced concentration-dependent .OH as estimated by generation of 2,3- and 2,5-DHBA. PPG (100, 200, 300, 400, 500 and 600 nmoles) produced concentration-dependent decreases in .OH adduct products (approximately 70% inhibition with 600 nmoles of PPG). It did not affect the peak of standard 2.3- and 2.5-DHBA indicating that the decrease in the adduct product generated by H2O2 is due to scavenging of .OH. These results indicate that photolysis of H2O2 by UV light produces .OH and that PPG scavenges .OH. 3ahydroxyl radicals 3afree radicals 3aphotolysis 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3alipids 3aoils 3afood additives 3aphenolic compounds 2aAntioxidantsxpharmacology 2aBenzocycloheptenesxpharmacology 2aChromatography, High Pressure Liquid 2aDose-Response Relationship, Drug 2aFood Preservativesxpharmacology 2aFree Radical Scavengers 2aGentisates 2aHydrogen Peroxidexradiation effects 2aHydroxybenzoatesxanalysisxmetabolism. 2aHydroxyl Radicalxmetabolism 2aHydroxylation 2aPhotolysis 2aSalicylatesxmetabolism 2aSalicylic Acid 2aUltraviolet Rays 0aantioxidants1 aLaxdal, V.A.0 tMolecular and cellular biochemistry.g1994 June 29, v. 135, no. 2 p.153-158x0300-81777nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF009265183Available from publisher's Web site  a19950110b19950113c00000000  aINDdLDP  aNon-US  mNon-PubAg articles 7aarticle03472naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002800110040001800138100001400156245007200170300001600242520198900258650001402247650001402261650002702275650001602302650002502318650001802343650001702361650002202378650001502400650000902415650001202424650004102436650001402477650002902491650003002520650000902550650003102559650002302590653001602613653001702629653001602646700001602662773009702678852000902775856007802784930003302862945001302895946001102908990002302919655001202942IND2042701620221117200401.0941019e19940330ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204270162DNAL7 a79690982pmid7 a10.1007/BF009269242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDas, K.C.10aImpairment of raw 264.7 macrophage function by antiarrhythmic drugs  ap. 151-162.  aThe effect of the antiarrhythmic drugs lidocaine, quinidine and procainamide on macrophage function was investigated in RAW 264.7 mouse monocytic macrophage cell. Cells stimulated by either zymosan or phorbol ester were found to generate both superoxide (O2(-)) and H2O2. The production of O2 was detected as superoxide dismutase inhibitable ferricytochrome c reduction. H2O2 production was monitored in both chemical and flow cytometric fluorescent assays. Although all three drugs inhibited both O2 and H2O2 release in a dose dependent manner, only quinidine was found to have significant inhibitory effects. The amounts of quinidine required to cause a 50% inhibition in O2 production in zymosan and phorbol ester stimulated cells were found to be 250 micromolar and 300 micromolar, respectively and the amounts required to cause one-half optimum levels of H2O2 production in these cells were found to be 50 micromolar and 100 micromolar, respectively. The effect of these drugs on O2 producing NADPH oxidase was investigated and only procainamide was found to have a significant effect (p < 0.001) in inhibiting the oxidase activity. Lidocaine and quinidine had no significant effect on the activation of the respiratory burst oxidase. A sensitive and convenient 'differential phagocytosis' assay was devised on the basis of number of particles engulfed by individual phagocytes using flow cytometric techniques. It appears to be remarkably free of interference and was applied to investigate the role of antiarrhythmic drugs on the phagocytosis of fluorescent latex beads. All three antiarrhythmic drugs inhibited phagocytosis of latex beads in a dose dependent manner irrespective of the number of particles phagocitized by the cells. The results of these studies do not conclusively establish a mechanism of action of these drugs on the generation of O2 and H2O2 by stimulated macrophages; nevertheless, it is interesting that all three drugs inhibited the phagocytic activity. 3alidocaine 3aquinidine 3amyocardial depressants 3amacrophages 3asuperoxide dismutase 3afree radicals 3aphagocytosis 3ahydrogen peroxide 3acell lines 3amice 2aAnimals 2aAnti-Arrhythmia Agentsxpharmacology 2aCell Line 2aHydrogen Peroxidexblood 2aMacrophagesxdrug effects 2aMice 2aPhagocytosisxdrug effects 2aSuperoxidesxblood 0arespiration 0aprocainamide 0aoxyradicals1 aMisra, H.P.0 tMolecular and cellular biochemistry.g1994 Mar. 30, v. 132, no. 2 p.151-162x0300-81777nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF009269243Available from publisher's Web site  a19941102b19941107c00000000  aINDdLDP  aNon-US  mNon-PubAg articles 7aarticle03892naa a2200625 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002800110040001800138100001500156245009200171300001600263520204900279650001402328650001702342650002302359650001302382650001702395650001602412650001302428650001002441650002002451650001002471650003002481650002602511650001102537650001102548650002902559650002302588650003202611650004402643650002502687650001402712650005602726650002902782653001602811653004002827700001902867700001702886700001902903700001802922700001602940700001702956700001702973773009702990852000903087856007803096930003303174945001303207946001103220990002303231655001203254IND2042044220221117200134.0940916e19940223ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204204422DNAL7 a80357802pmid7 a10.1007/BF009259512doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCester, N.10aPregnancy induced hypertension: a role for peroxidation in microvillus plasma membranes  ap. 151-155.  aIt has been recently hypothesized that in PIH a placental oxidant-antioxidant imbalance might cause the release of lipoperoxidation products into the circulation, with subsequent damage of endothelial cell membranes. In this hypothesis the endothelial cell and further increase in circulating lipoperoxide levels, which are by themselves able to induce smooth muscle constriction and increased pressor responsiveness to angiotensin II. In order to investigate this issue, we studied the basal content of lipid peroxides in terms of malondialdehyde (MDA) in the syncytiotrophoblast plasma membranes (SPM) from PIH women. Moreover, we investigated the susceptibility to peroxidation of SPM using an in vitro oxidative stress as a tool to verify the predisposition to the in vivo development of peroxidation products. The fatty acid composition of the membranes was also analyzed. Microvillus membrane lipoperoxide concentrations were significantly increased in PIH women (62.8 +/- 7.6 ng MDA/mg prot) compared with healthy pregnant subjects (37.6 +/- 4.8 ng MDA/mg prot; p < 0.01). The formation of TBARS under the action of phenylhydrazine was significantly greater in PIH women (90.3 +/- 7.4 mmol MDA/mol cholesterol) than in normal pregnant subjects (68.6 +/- 6.4 mmol MDA/mol cholesterol; p < 0.01). In PIH microvillus membrane we also observed a significant increase of the content of polyunsaturated arachidonic acid. The increased susceptibility to oxidative stress of SPMs from PIH women might be due either to reduced antioxidant systems or to an abnormality of the lipid composition of the membrane. The present work also demonstrated in PIH a reduction in the SPM content of saturated fatty acids with an increase in polyunsaturated fatty acids, which are the major substrate for peroxidation. On the other hand, the higher lipoperoxidation may be due to the observed increased susceptibility to peroxidative stress, to a primary reduction in placental perfusion with tissue hypoxia or to both factors, which can potentiate each other. 3apregnancy 3ahypertension 3alipid peroxidation 3aoxidants 3aantioxidants 3afatty acids 3aplacenta 3awomen 3aplasma membrane 2aAdult 2aCell Membranexmetabolism 2aEndotheliumxcytology 2aFemale 2aHumans 2aHypertensionxmetabolism 2aLipid Peroxidation 2aMalondialdehydexmetabolism 2aMicrovillixmetabolismxultrastructure. 2aPlacentaxmetabolism 2aPregnancy 2aPregnancy Complications, Cardiovascularxmetabolism 2aTrophoblastsxmetabolism 0acomposition 0asyncytiotrophoblast plasma membrane1 aStaffolani, R.1 aRabini, R.A.1 aMagnanelli, R.1 aSalvolini, E.1 aGalassi, R.1 aMazzanti, L.1 aRomanini, C.0 tMolecular and cellular biochemistry.g1994 Feb. 23, v. 131, no. 2 p.151-155x0300-81777nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF009259513Available from publisher's Web site  a19941004b19941021c00000000  aINDdLDP  aNon-US  mNon-PubAg articles 7aarticle02034naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002800110040001800138100001400156245009300170300001600263520056000279650001500839650001700854650003800871650002000909650001300929650001000942650000900952650001200961650002500973650003700998650003101035650001301066650000901079650004701088650001501135650002901150650000901179650001701188650001601205653001501221700001601236773009701252852000901349856007801358930003301436945001301469946001101482990002301493655001201516IND2037664020221117200129.0940304e19930721ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND203766402DNAL7 a82322822pmid7 a10.1007/BF009292022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRao, G.V.10aInhibition of monoamine oxidase-A of rat brain by pyrethroids--an in vitro kinetic study  ap. 107-114.  aAn in vitro kinetic study on inhibition of the monoamine oxidase-A (MAO-A) of the rat brain by two pyrethroids, namely permethrin (PM) and cypermethrin (CPM), has shown that PM and CPM competitively inhibit MAO-A by altering both the Michaelis-menten constant (Km) and the maximum velocity (Vmax).

These enzymes varied in their ability to solubilise xylan from pulp, and the selective removal of pulp xylan did not reduce intrinsic fibre strength. At low levels of xylan solubilisation, there were increases in sheet densification after PFI refining without change in tensile and tear strength at a given sheet density, indicating lower pulp refining requirements. At high levels of xylan solubilisation, the level of sheet densification was greater but there was a small decrease in tensile strength at a given sheet density and an increase in tear strength. One of the xylanases yielded a selective increase in tear strength at a given tensile strength. 3axylan 3asulfates 3awood pulp 3asoftwood 3axylan endo-1,3-beta-xylosidase 3aenzymatic treatment 3akraft pulping 3atensile strength 0aO-glycoside hydrolases 0aglycosidases 0atreatment1 aKibblewhite, R.P.1 aSignal, F.A.0 tJournal of wood chemistry and technology.g1999, v. 19, no. 3 p.203-212x0277-38137nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/027738199093496083Available from publisher's Web site  a20001102b20001113c00000000  aINDdLDP  aOther US 7aarticle02637naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001600145245017600161300001600337500001500353520149900368650003201867650001101899650001901910650002201929650001801951650002901969653002501998653001802023773009302041852000902134856008502143930003302228945001302261946001302274655001202287IND2199325220221117200042.0990616s1998    nyu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND219932522DNAL7 a10.1080/027738198093495792doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDavis, M.W.12aA rapid modified method for compositional carbohydrate analysis of lignocellulosics by high pH anion-exchange chromatography with pulsed amperometric detection (HPAEC/PAD)  ap. 235-252.  a2019-12-04  aDuring the last decade, high pH anion exchange chromatography with pulsed amperometric detection (HPAEC/PAC) has gained increasing acceptance as the method of choice for analysis of neutral sugars commonly occurring in woods, pulps, and other lignocellulosics. This paper describes modified chromatographic conditions and discusses other critical factors that improve the precision and efficiency of this application. The method involves a controlled loading of acetate onto the column prior to equilibration with water and injection of sample. In-line solid-phase extraction is used to remove hydrophobic substances that have the potential to foul the analytical column. Critical operational parameters for the successful application of the method include a metal-free flowpath and a consistent application of anions with sample. Resolution of rhamnose is achieved while maintaining the resolution of xylose and mannose. Simplified sample pretreatment allows a ca. five-fold increase in sample through-put compared with gas chromatography of derivatized sugars or to partition chromatography. Run times are less than half those of the widely used hydroxide reverse gradient method for HPAEC/PAD analysis of wood sugars. Long-term system performance data indicate that the method is highly precise and robust. The acetate loading method affords better precision than those of other HPAEC/PAD methods and of gas chromatographic analysis of alditol acetate derivatives by Tappi Method T249 cm-85. 3aion exchange chromatography 3asugars 3alignocellulose 3achemical analysis 3arapid methods 3acarbohydrate composition 0achemical composition 0acarbohydrates0 tJournal of wood chemistry and technology.g1998, v. 18, no. 2 p.235-252x0277-38137nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/027738198093495793Available from publisher's Web site  a19990802b19990812c00000000  aINDdLDP  aOther US 7aarticle02549naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001300145245010900158300001600267520131500283650001401598650001901612650001901631650001401650650002301664650001001687650001901697650001101716650001301727650001901740653001601759653002001775653001701795700002001812700001101832700002601843773009301869852000901962856008501971930003302056945001302089946001302102655001202115IND2202327220221117200045.0000131s1998    nyu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220232722DNAL7 a10.1080/027738198093495812doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYuan, Z.14aThe formation of gaseous products and its relation to pulp bleaching during the peracetic acid treatment  ap. 267-288.  aWhen used in pulp bleaching, peracetic acid is consumed by two competitive pathways: oxidation of pulp and wasteful reactions such as decomposition. In this paper, the peracetic acid consumed in wasteful reactions is quantified by determining the gaseous products evolved. It is found that although carbon dioxide is formed under certain conditions, oxygen is the dominant product of the wasteful reactions. The oxygen formation is directly proportional to the consumption of oxidants (as peracetic acid and hydrogen peroxide) in the wasteful reactions with 2 moles of oxidant consumed per mole of oxygen formed. Therefore, the brightening efficiency during peracetic acid treatment can be characterized by correcting the measured peracetic acid consumption for decomposition. The peracetic acid brightening results for an oxygen delignified softwood kraft pulp are reported. It is found that a significant amount of peracetic acid is consumed by the wasteful reactions during the brightening. The effect of process parameters on the peracetic acid brightening efficiency is determined. It is shown for an oxygen delignified softwood kraft pulp that there is a unique relationship between pulp brightness gain and peracetic acid consumption due to the pulp oxidation irrespective of the brightening conditions. 3awood pulp 3aperacetic acid 3aacid treatment 3aviscosity 3achemical reactions 3agases 3acarbon dioxide 3aoxygen 3asoftwood 3aoxygen pulping 0abrightening 0apulp brightness 0akappa number1 aD'Entremont, M.1 aNi, Y.1 aVan Heiningen, A.R.P.0 tJournal of wood chemistry and technology.g1998, v. 18, no. 3 p.267-288x0277-38137nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/027738198093495813Available from publisher's Web site  a20000404b20000411c00000000  aINDdLDP  aOther US 7aarticle02215naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001200145245013300157300001400290520112500304650001501429650000901444650001901453650001101472650002501483650001801508700001501526700001201541700001601553700001301569700001501582773009101597852000901688856008501697930003301782945001301815946001301828655001201841IND2197742120221117200718.0990324s1998    nyu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND219774212DNAL7 a10.1080/027738198093501232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOna, T.10aNon-destructive determination of hemicellulosic neutral sugar composition in native wood by Fourier transform Raman spectroscopy  ap. 27-41.  aThe feasibility of using FT-Raman spectroscopy for rapid non-destructive determination of hemicellulosic neutral sugar composition, important factors for pulp properties, in native wood was examined using two Eucalyptus species, including samples of various ages and colors, which are important sources of plantation pulpwood. The sugars, glucose, xylose, galactose, rhamnose, arabinose and mannose were utilized. The application of 2nd derivatives transformation of Raman spectroscopic data revealed highly significant correlations between wet chemical and Raman predicted values in the calibration (known samples) with correlation coefficients > 0.99, and in the prediction (unknown samples) with correlation coefficients > 0.80 with the exception of rhamnose and mannose. Consequently, this non-destructive method will be valid for analyzing Eucalyptus native wood meal samples, regardless of their age and color to determine hemicellulosic neutral sugar composition except rhamnose and mannose. Elite tree selection based on quality aspects for pulp and paper production can be performed using FT-Raman spectroscopy. 3aEucalyptus 3awood 3awood chemistry 3asugars 3achemical composition 3ahemicellulose1 aSonoda, T.1 aIto, K.1 aShibata, M.1 aKato, T.1 aOotake, Y.0 tJournal of wood chemistry and technology.g1998, v. 18, no. 1 p.27-41x0277-38137nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/027738198093501233Available from publisher's Web site  a19990503b19990512c00000000  aINDdLDP  aOther US 7aarticle03365naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024004200133040001800175100002200193245005600215300001600271520166700287650000901954650001401963650001201977650004101989650002602030650003202056650001102088650002002099650005102119650003302170650002202203650003902225650003102264650002802295650003202323650000902355650002302364650001402387650003402401650002302435650002302458653001902481653001902500653001402519700002502533773010802558852000902666856009202675930003302767946001102800655001202811IND4417227920221117200756.0090306e200904  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441722792DNAL7 a187782882pmid7 aPMC26733682pmcid7 a10.1111/j.1365-2567.2008.02918.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBizargity, Peyman10aDendritic cells: a family portrait at mid-gestation  ap. 565-578.  aRecent advances in our understanding of dendritic cells (DCs) and their role in tolerance and immunity has fuelled study of their normal development and function within the reproductive tract. The common hypothesis that pregnancy is a state of immune suppression or deviation now includes the idea that alterations in DC phenotype and function are critical for maternal tolerance. We chose to study DCs in the uterus and lymphoid tissue in non-pregnant and pregnant mice at mid-gestation to understand what DC-related factors may be involved in premature birth. We used a mouse model where the mother's immune system has been shown to respond to the male antigen H-Y. Observed differences among DCs in the uterus, uterine draining nodes and spleen, even in non-pregnant mice, suggest the existence of a specialized uterus-specific subset of DCs. We further found that, amongst CD45⁺ CD11c⁺ cells in the uterus and peripheral lymphoid tissue of pregnant mice, expression of major histocompatibility complex class II (MHC II) and costimulatory molecules (i.e. CD80) was similar to that in the non-pregnant state. Moreover, there was no pregnancy-related decrease in the proportion of CD11c⁺ cells in the uterus or in the uterine node that were CD11b⁻ CD8⁺. Pregnancy increased the CD11b⁺ subsets and the expression of chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 6 (CCL6) in DCs of the uterine draining nodes. Finally, DC subsets showed variable expression, with respect to tissue and pregnancy, of the cytokine interleukin-15, which is important in lymphoid cell homeostasis. For DCs, pregnancy is not a state of immune paralysis, but of dynamic developmental change. 3amice 3apregnancy 2aAnimals 2aLeukocyte Common Antigensxanalysis. 2aCytokinesxmetabolism 2aDendritic Cellsximmunology 2aFemale 2aGestational Age 2aHistocompatibility Antigens Class IIxanalysis 2aImmune Toleranceximmunology 2aImmunophenotyping 2aInflammation Mediatorsxmetabolism 2aInterleukin-15xmetabolism 2aLymph Nodesximmunology 2aLymphoid Tissueximmunology 2aMice 2aMice, Inbred C57BL 2aPregnancy 2aPregnancy, Animalximmunology 2aSpleenximmunology 2aUterusximmunology 0adendritic cell 0ainterleukin-15 0atolerance1 aBonney, Elizabeth A.0 tImmunology.g2009 Apr., v. 126, no. 4 p.565-578dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0019-28057nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2567.2008.02918.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20090306b00000000c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02660naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002100145245016300166300001600329500002800345520146400373650003801837650002601875653005001901653001701951653003201968700001802000700001902018700002402037700002202061773013402083852000902217856008502226946001102311655001202322IND4414014220221117200748.0081219s2009    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441401422DNAL7 a10.1007/s00216-008-2341-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKakuda, Hiroyuki10aMultivariate analysis of DSC-XRD simultaneous measurement data: a study of multistage crystalline structure changes in a linear poly(ethylene imine) thin film  ap. 367-376.  aPublisher supplied data  aA multivariate analytical technique has been applied to the analysis of simultaneous measurement data from differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) in order to study thermal changes in crystalline structure of a linear poly(ethylene imine) (LPEI) film. A large number of XRD patterns generated from the simultaneous measurements were subjected to an augmented alternative least-squares (ALS) regression analysis, and the XRD patterns were readily decomposed into chemically independent XRD patterns and their thermal profiles were also obtained at the same time. The decomposed XRD patterns and the profiles were useful in discussing the minute peaks in the DSC. The analytical results revealed the following changes of polymorphisms in detail: An LPEI film prepared by casting an aqueous solution was composed of sesquihydrate and hemihydrate crystals. The sesquihydrate one was lost at an early stage of heating, and the film changed into an amorphous state. Once the sesquihydrate was lost by heating, it was not recovered even when it was cooled back to room temperature. When the sample was heated again, structural changes were found between the hemihydrate and the amorphous components. In this manner, the simultaneous DSC-XRD measurements combined with ALS analysis proved to be powerful for obtaining a better understanding of the thermally induced changes of the crystalline structure in a polymer film.

The transcriptional network that governs hyphal morphogenesis is complex, depends on several regulators and is not completely understood. Recently, CaUME6, a homolog of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae UME6 gene, has been shown to be required for hyphal elongation. In the present study, the C. albicans ume6Δ strain showed a complete defect in hyphae formation under all the growth conditions tested. UME6 was repressed by the Nrg1-Tup1 repressor in yeast-form cells but NRG1 was not repressed by Ume6p under hyphal growth conditions. Wild-type UME6 expression depended on each hyphal regulator tested, and ectopic UME6 expression in efg1Δ, cph1Δ and ras1Δ cells rescued the hyphal defects of these mutants under some hyphal growth conditions. Thus, UME6 is a common downstream target of regulators promoting hyphal development. Ectopic UME6 expression promoted both germ tube formation and hyphal elongation. The expression of all hyphae-specific genes investigated depended on UME6 expression. A model for transcriptional regulation of hyphal development and the role of Ume6p is proposed. 3aCandida albicans 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3aenvironmental factors 3agenes 3agerm tube 3amodels 3amorphogenesis 3amutants 3atranscription (genetics) 3atranscription factors 3avirulence 3ayeasts 2aCandida albicansxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aFungal Proteinsxbiosynthesisxgenetics. 2aGene Deletion 2aGene Expression Profiling 2aGene Expression Regulation, Fungal 2aHyphaexgeneticsxgrowth & development. 2aModels, Biological 2aRepressor Proteinsxbiosynthesisxgenetics. 0aUME6 0ahyphal development 0agerm tube 0aNRG11 aLettner, Thomas1 aLassnig, Caroline1 aMuller, Mathias.1 aLajko, Robert1 aHintner, H.q(Helmut)1 aBreitenbach, Michael1 aBito, Arnold0 tFEMS yeast research.g2009 Feb., v. 9, no. 1 p.126-142dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx1567-13567nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1567-1364.2008.00459.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20090109b20090206c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03367naa a2200601 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100001600171245016800187300001600355520130500371650002401676650001801700650002901718650001701747650001201764650001101776650001701787650001601804650000901820650002001829650001201849650005801861650004901919650001101968650006001979650006902039650006102108650001102169650004602180650004802226650000902274650002202283653002002305653003402325653002502359653000802384700002102392700001902413700001502432700001702447700001702464773012702481852000902608856009202617930003302709946001102742655001202753IND4418921420221117200744.0090410e200905  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441892142DNAL7 a191874882pmid7 a10.1111/j.1472-765X.2009.02557.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuynh, H.Q.10aLactoferrin and desferrioxamine are ineffective in the treatment of Helicobacter pylori infection and may enhance H. pylori growth and gastric inflammation in mice  ap. 517-522.  aTo evaluate the efficacy of bovine lactoferrin (BLf), recombinant human lactoferrin (rHLf) and desferrioxamine against Helicobacter pylori in vitro and in mice and also to determine whether BLf or rHLf alter gastric inflammation. In vitro: Broth dilution susceptibility tests were performed using different concentrations of desferrioxamine, BLf and rHLf. Murine trials: In the prevention trial, C57BL/6 female mice were treated with BLf or rHLF, and then infected with the SS1 strain of H. pylori. In the treatment trial, mice were gavaged with either BLf, rHLf or desferrioxamine. In addition, gastric myeloperoxidase activity (MPO) was measured to assess gastric inflammation. Desferoxamine was found to have a direct bactericidal effect, while BLf and rHLf only partially suppressed H. pylori growth in vitro. However, in both prevention and treatment trials all three forms of treatment failed to reduce H. pylori load in mice. Gastric MPO activity and H. pylori load were noted to be higher with lactoferrin treatments. Our study does not support the use of BLf or rHLF in the treatment of human H. pylori infection. Interestingly, H. pylori growth and gastric inflammation appear to be enhanced by lactoferrin treatment. The mouse model is ideal for testing novel H. pylori eradicating agents. 3aHelicobacter pylori 3aanimal models 3aantibacterial properties 3adeferoxamine 3afemales 3ahumans 3ainflammation 3alactoferrin 3amice 3amyeloperoxidase 2aAnimals 2aAnti-Bacterial Agentsxadverse effectsxpharmacology. 2aDeferoxaminexadverse effectsxpharmacology. 2aFemale 2aGastric Mucosaxdrug effectsximmunologyxmicrobiology. 2aHelicobacter Infectionsxdrug therapyximmunologyxmicrobiology. 2aHelicobacter pylorixdrug effectsxgrowth & development. 2aHumans 2aInflammationxdrug therapyxmicrobiology. 2aLactoferrinxadverse effectsxpharmacology. 2aMice 2aTreatment Outcome 0adesferrioxamine 0aHelicobacter pylori infection 0airon chelating agent 0aMPO1 aCampbell, M.A.F.1 aCouper, R.T.L.1 aTran, C.D.1 aLawrence, A.1 aButler, R.N.0 tLetters in applied microbiology.g2009 May, v. 48, no. 5 p.517-522dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0266-82547nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1472-765X.2009.02557.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20090410b20090508c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02640naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002300152245010900175300001600284520116700300650002601467650002101493650000901514650002501523650002001548650000901568650002701577650001801604650001801622650002501640650003001665650001001695650001401705651002301719651001901742653001901761653002101780700002501801700002301826700002301849700002401872773011701896852000902013856009202022930003302114946001102147655001202158IND4418543920221117200814.0090403e200904  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441854392DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-2109.2008.02141.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSeaborn, Gloria T.10aComparative fatty acid composition of eggs from wild and captive black sea bass, Centropristis striata L  ap. 656-668.  aLipid content, lipid class and fatty acid compositions were determined in eggs from wild and captive black sea bass, Centropristis striata L., from northern (New England) and southern (South Carolina) regions to determine the effects of diet on egg composition and fertilization success. The formulated diets fed to the northern captive (NC) fish were higher in total lipids (22%) compared with the cut fish and squid diet fed to the southern fish (SC; 3.3% lipid) and had a higher relative amount of linoleic acid (LA) and lower relative amounts of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and arachidonic acid (AA). These dietary differences were broadly reflected in the egg lipid composition. The LA levels were higher in all lipid classes in eggs of NC fish while AA levels were lower. The DHA was higher in the major polar lipids (PL) (phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine) of SC eggs compared with NC. Compared with wild fish, both captive groups produced eggs with PLs richer in LA and lower in DHA and AA. Over all fish groups, fertilization success was directly correlated with levels of DHA and AA in the PLs and was inversely correlated with LA levels. 3aCentropristis striata 3aarachidonic acid 3adiet 3adocosahexaenoic acid 3aegg composition 3aeggs 3afatty acid composition 3alinoleic acid 3alipid content 3aphosphatidylcholines 3aphosphatidylethanolamines 3asquid 3awild fish 3aNew England region 3aSouth Carolina 0ablack sea bass 0abroodstock diets1 aSmith, Theodore I.J.1 aDenson, Michael R.1 aWalker, Abigail B.1 aBerlinsky, David L.0 tAquaculture research.g2009 Apr., v. 40, no. 6 p.656-668dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx1355-557X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2109.2008.02141.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20090404b20090508c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02842naa a2200289 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001700152245010800169300001400277520188600291653001402177653001802191653002502209653002602234653001402260700001802274773010302292852000902395856009202404930003302496946001102529655001202540IND4416549520221117200734.0090220e200902  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441654952DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1468-8123.2009.00239.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCHENG, J.-T.10aFinite element modeling of slug tests in an aquifer with stratigraphical and structural heterogeneities  ap. 49-62.  aSlug interference tests using an array of multilevel active and monitoring wells permit enhanced aquifer characterization. Analyses of these field test data rely on numerical inverse models. In order to provide synthetic data sets and to have a better understanding of the flow mechanisms, we used a three-dimensional finite element analysis (FEHM) to explore the effects of idealized, stratigraphical (strata) and structural (faults) heterogeneities with low permeability values on the transient head field that is associated with slug tests in an aquifer. Firstly, we tested our model on homogeneous aquifers and the effectiveness of our modeling strategies have been validated via the excellent agreement of our modeling results with those of the semi-analytical model of Liu & Butler (1995) . In our heterogeneity investigations, we embedded vertical and horizontal zones of lower permeability into a homogenous, isotropic, and confined aquifer to represent low-permeability faults and strata respectively. A slugged interval is located at the center of the aquifer. Effects of strata thickness and permeability contrast as well as other effects associated with the offset of low-permeability strata were explored. In particular, modeling results are represented by contour maps of peak travel time and maximum head perturbation of generated hydraulic pulses. Furthermore, various phenomena, such as real-time matrix diffusion, intermittent matrix-fracture interactions, and faster pulse arrival through a longer flow trajectory, are concretely presented in the snapshots of head perturbations in the aquifer. Our finite element modeling provides useful information for understanding the behaviors of diffusive pressure propagation in an aquifer with stratigraphical and/or structural heterogeneities, and for designing hydraulic tomography to enhance aquifer characterization. 0aflow path 0aheterogeneity 0ahydraulic tomography 0ahydraulic travel time 0aslug test1 aEVERETT, M.E.0 tGeofluids.g2009 Feb., v. 9, no. 1 p.49-62dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx1468-81157nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1468-8123.2009.00239.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20090220b20090301c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03767naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002500152245005300177300001600230520247400246650001702720650001102737650001102748650001402759650002602773650001002799650002202809650001302831650001302844650001802857650001502875650001502890651001102905651002302916653001602939653002402955653002202979653002203001653002103023773012003044852000903164856009203173930003303265946001103298655001203309IND4416231420221117201106.0090213e200903  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441623142DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-2699.2007.01855.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLindstrom, Sandra C.14aThe biogeography of seaweeds in Southeast Alaska  ap. 401-409.  aThis article reviews the history of seaweed collections in Southeast Alaska from the early Russian explorers to contemporary efforts. It summarizes other studies of Southeast Alaskan seaweeds from a biogeographical perspective, and compares the known seaweed flora near three population centres (Ketchikan, Sitka and Juneau) with those of other regions within Alaska, and with nearby regions. For this article, Southeast Alaska includes all inside and outside waters of the Alexander Archipelago from Dixon Entrance (54°40' N, 133°00' W) to Icy Point (58°23'10" N, 137°04'20" W). The literature on seaweeds occurring in Southeast Alaska is reviewed from a biogeographical perspective, and herbarium records for Southeast Alaska from the Alaska Seaweed Database project are used to provide an overview of the biogeography of the area. Records for the population centres of Ketchikan, Sitka and Juneau are compared with records from other areas within Alaska and with nearby regions to determine floristic similarities. Southeast Alaska has the most diverse seaweed flora of any region of Alaska. A list of species known to occur in Southeast Alaska is appended (in Supplementary Material) and includes their reported occurrences in three population centres (Juneau, Ketchikan and Sitka). Recognition of at least three distinct biogeographical areas associated with these three centres is supported by a comparison of their floras with those of other regions in the North Pacific. A close relationship of some species with conspecifics in the north-west Atlantic is also noted. In contrast, ecological, physiological and genetic differentiation of Southeast Alaskan seaweeds from conspecifics in Washington State or even from different areas of Southeast Alaska are documented. A ShoreZone coastal habitat system, which is being implemented to inventory and map the entire shoreline of Southeast Alaska, is defining new biogeographical units called 'bioareas' on the basis of the distribution of canopy kelps and lower intertidal algal assemblages. Southeast Alaska has the most diverse seaweed flora of any region of Alaska. This is a reflection of its extensive coastline, with varied past and present environmental conditions. Different parts of Southeast Alaska show similarities to different areas outside Southeast Alaska. Despite this, much remains to be learned about the biogeography of seaweeds in Southeast Alaska, and many questions remain to be answered. 3abiogeography 3acanopy 3acoasts 3adatabases 3aenvironmental factors 3aflora 3agenetic variation 3ahabitats 3aherbaria 3alittoral zone 3amacroalgae 3ashorelines 3aAlaska 3aWashington (state) 0acollections 0adistribution limits 0anortheast Pacific 0aShoreZone mapping 0aSoutheast Alaska0 tJournal of biogeography.g2009 Mar., v. 36, no. 3 p.401-409dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0305-02707nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2699.2007.01855.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20090213b20090301c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02836naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001700152245008500169300001600254520169400270650002201964650002201986650001102008650002502019650001102044650001002055650002702065650002002092650002002112650001302132651001902145700002202164773013102186852000902317856009202326930003302418946001102451655001202462IND4411162820221117201157.0081010e200811  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441116282DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1461-9563.2008.00397.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHicks, Helen10aDifferential responses of three Agriotes click beetle species to pheromone traps  ap. 443-448.  a1 Previous work had suggested that adult male click beetles (Agriotes spp.) show differential responses to species specific pheromone traps. This hypothesis was tested using mark-release-recapture methods to estimate the maximum sampling range and the effective sampling area of traps for three species. 2 Captured beetles of the species Agriotes lineatus, Agriotes obscurus and Agriotes sputator were marked to show the direction of release, the distance of the release point from the trap and the replicate. Analysis of variance showed that there were significant differences in recapture rates between species and release distances. There were no significant differences between release direction and replicates. 3 Calculated linear speeds suggested differences in movement rates in the order: A. lineatus > A. obscurus > A. sputator. There were also substantial differences between the species in the maximum sampling ranges and effective sampling areas of the traps. These placed the species in the same order. 4 The results are used to estimate the minimum cost of mass trapping programmes to prevent males from mating, giving values of [Euro Sign]165/ha/year (A. lineatus), [Euro Sign]247.5/ha/year (A. obscurus) and [Euro Sign]2343/ha/year (A. sputator). 5 Implications for the use of pheromone traps in wireworm pest management are discussed. It is concluded that current U.K. recommendations based on the cumulative total catch of the three species over a sampling season can be improved by considering the spatial relationships between the adult trapping system and larval distribution. The current constraint to this is the general inability to separate wireworms into species. 3aAgriotes lineatus 3aAgriotes obscurus 3aadults 3aanalysis of variance 3alarvae 3amales 3amark-recapture studies 3apest management 3apheromone traps 3atrapping 3aUnited Kingdom1 aBlackshaw, Rod P.0 tAgricultural and forest entomology.g2008 Nov., v. 10, no. 4 p.443-448dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx1461-95557nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1461-9563.2008.00397.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20081010b20081101c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02967naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001500164245011800179300001400297520134300311650002501654650002101679650001501700650001301715650001501728650001501743650003301758650002101791650001501812650003601827650002001863650003001883650001801913653005901931653004001990653002602030653001802056653001102074700002002085700001702105700001902122700001902141700002002160773013102180852000902311856008502320930003302405946001102438655001202449IND4419091020221117201117.0090410e200905  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441909102DNAL7 a192744562pmid7 a10.1007/s00216-009-2703-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Wei 10aMonitoring of vesicular exocytosis from single cells using micrometer and nanometer-sized electrochemical sensors  ap. 17-32.  aCommunication between cells by release of specific chemical messengers via exocytosis plays crucial roles in biological process. Electrochemical detection based on ultramicroelectrodes (UMEs) has become one of the most powerful techniques in real-time monitoring of an extremely small number of released molecules during very short time scales, owing to its intrinsic advantages such as fast response, excellent sensitivity, and high spatiotemporal resolution. Great successes have been achieved in the use of UME methods to obtain quantitative and kinetic information about released chemical messengers and to reveal the molecular mechanism in vesicular exocytosis. In this paper, we review recent developments in monitoring exocytosis by use of UMEs-electrochemical-based techniques including electrochemical detection using micrometer and nanometer-sized sensors, scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM), and UMEs implemented in lab-on-a-chip (LOC) microsystems. These advances are of great significance in obtaining a better understanding of vesicular exocytosis and chemical communications between cells, and will facilitate developments in many fields, including analytical chemistry, biological science, and medicine. Furthermore, future developments in electrochemical probing of exocytosis are also proposed.

This soilborne pathogen produces many resting spores which can remain dormant for long periods, are highly resistant to environmental stresses and can spread the disease on seed potatoes and in contaminated soil. The enigmatic nature of this organism exacerbates the development of effective powdery scab control methods. Substantial knowledge has been gained in the last decade on the biology of the pathogen and the epidemiology of the disease, but no single effective control measure is, or is likely to be, available. An integrated approach to powdery scab management is the aim, with host resistance as a substantial and sustainable component. Further research on the epidemiology of powdery scab and population genetics of the pathogen is urgently required. All stakeholders involved in the potato industry must become aware that solution of the powdery scab problem is likely to be a long-term goal. When resistant cultivars with all the other characteristics demanded for marketing high-quality potatoes are available, and when disease risk from the pathogen on seed and/or in soil can be accurately determined, then the mission to develop effective powdery scab control will become achievable. 3aSpongospora subterranea 3acontrol methods 3acultivars 3adisease control 3aepidemiology 3aindustry 3amarketing 3apathogens 3apolluted soils 3apopulation genetics 3apotatoes 3arisk 3aseed tubers 3aspores 3astakeholders 0aIntegrated disease management 0aResistance 0aSpongospora subterranea f. sp. subterranea1 aFalloon, R.

A comparative study of cranial morphology of four mammalian clades  ap. 1024-1035.  aUnderstanding why rates of morphological evolution vary is a major goal in evolutionary biology. Classical work suggests that body size, interspecific competition, geographic range size and specialization may all be important, and each may increase or decrease rates of evolution. Here, we investigate correlates of proportional evolutionary rates in phalangeriform possums, phyllostomid bats, platyrrhine monkeys and marmotine squirrels, using phylogenetic comparative methods. We find that the most important correlate is body size. Large species evolve the fastest in all four clades, and there is a nonlinear relationship in platyrrhines and phalangeriformes, with the slowest evolution in species of intermediate size. We also find significant increases in rate with high environmental temperature in phyllostomids, and low mass-specific metabolic rate in marmotine squirrels. The mechanisms underlying these correlations are uncertain and appear to be size specific. We conclude that there is significant variation in rates of evolution, but that its meaning is not yet clear. 3aChiroptera 3aambient temperature 3abody size 3ainterspecific competition 3ametabolism 3amonkeys 3aphylogeny 3apossums 3asquirrels 2aAnimals 2aBiological Evolution 2aBody Sizexphysiology 2aBody Weights and Measures 2aMammalsxanatomy & histology 2aModels, Biological 2aPhenotype 2aPhylogeny 2aSkullxanatomy & histology 2aSpecies Specificity 2aTemperature 0abody mass 0aMarmotini 0anode density effect 0aphylogenetic generalized linear model 0aPhalangeriformes 0aPlatyrrhini1 aPURVIS, A.0 tJournal of evolutionary biology.g2009 May, v. 22, no. 5 p.1024-1035dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx1010-061X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1420-9101.2009.01714.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20090417b20090508c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02963naa a2200661 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003600111040001800147072001700165072001700182100001900199245006500218300001600283500011300299500001500412520076400427592002801191650002001219650002801239650001801267650002001285650002001305650002301325650002001348650002101368650002601389650001301415650001501428650001901443650001601462650002001478650004101498650003701539650001101576650005201587650003001639650004001669650002001709650002001729650005701749650006501806650003001871651001201901653002301913653001601936700001601952773013401968852000902102856008602111930003302197945002502230946001102255990002302266655001202289IND4364017420221117200628.0040819e20040501xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436401742DNAL7 a152960822pmid7 a10.1024/0300-9831.74.3.2232doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aBertsias,  G.10aFruit and Vegetables Consumption in Relation to Health and Diet of Medical Students in Crete, Greece  ap. 107-117.  a2019-12-04  aIn Greece, prevalence of cardiovascular disease has been increasing during the last few decades. From a public health point of view, it is important to identify lifestyle practices associated with cardiovascular disease risk factors. As part of the Clinical Nutrition course at the University of Crete School of Medicine, 507 medical students (292 men, 215 women) were examined during the period 1995–2001. Individual 24-hour dietary recalls were taken, lifestyle questionnaires were completed, and anthropometric and serum lipid measurements were performed. Fruits and vegetables were consumed by 90% of men (370 ± 275 g/day) and 94% of women (354 ± 283 g/day). Among non/ex-smokers who ate fruit and vegetables, 41% consumed _400 g/day, compared to 31% of current smokers (p = 0.05). The risk for high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) < 35 mg/dL, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) _ 130 mg/dL, and total cholesterol/HDL-C ratio (TC:HDL-C) _ 5 decreased with increasing quartile of fruit and vegetables consumption (trend p < 0.01). Fruit and vegetable intake was favorably related to intake of dietary fiber, calcium, magnesium, potassium, folate, and vitamins C, E, A, B1 and B6, and inversely related to saturated and trans fatty acids and cholesterol. Prospective studies should be performed within the general young adult population to assess the long-term effects of fruit and vegetable consumption on chronic disease risk development.  aPublisher supplied data 3adiet-related diseases 3adiet history 3avitamins 3awomen 3ayoung adults 3asmoking (habit) 3arisk assessment 3acollege students 3adietary fiber 3ablood lipids 3amen 3aanthropometric measurements 3arisk factors 3alifestyle 3ahigh density lipoprotein 3acardiovascular diseases 3acholesterol 3alow density lipoprotein 3afood choices 3avegetables 3adietary minerals 2aAdult 2aAnthropometry 2aCardiovascular Diseasesxepidemiology 2aCholesterolxblood 2aCholesterol, HDLxblood 2aCholesterol, LDLxblood 2aDiet 2aDietary Fiberxadministration & dosage 2aFemale 2aFruit 2aHealth Status 2aHumans 2aLife Style 2aLipidsxblood 2aMale 2aMineralsxadministration & dosage 2aSurveys and Questionnaires. 2aRisk Factors 2aStudents, Medical 2aVegetables 2aVitaminsxadministration & dosage 3aGreece 0aGreece 0aeating habits 0afruits (food) 0adiet1 aLinardakis,  M.1 aMammas,  I.1 aKafatos,  A.0 tInternational journal for vitamin and nutrition research.g2005 Mar. 1, v. 75, no. 2 p.107-117dVerlag Hans Huberx0300-98317nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1024/0300-9831.75.2.1073Available from publisher's Web site  a20080731b20080801c00000000  aINDd4CTe2005/11/01  aNon-US  mNon-PubAg articles 7aarticle03699naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001900129245016600148300001800314500001500332520212200347650001302469650001402482650001902496650001202515650002002527650002002547650001502567650000902582650002002591650001802611650001902629650001202648650002702660650003002687650006602717650002002783650003602803650006002839650001102899650000902910650001402919650006102933653002002994700001303014773007403027852000903101930003303110945001303143946001303156655001203169IND2198613520221117200104.0990509e199811  nyu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND219861352DNAL7 a107344192pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNowshari, M.A.10aEffect of cryoprotectants and their concentration on post-thaw survival and development of expanded mouse blastocysts frozen by a simple rapid-freezing procedure  ap. 1001-1013.  a2019-12-05  aExperiments were conducted to develop a simple rapid-freezing protocol for expanded mouse blastocyst-stage embryos. The effect of type of cryoprotectant (ethylene glycol and propylene glycol) and its concentrations (4.5, 6.0 and 7.0 mol/L each with 0.5 mol/L sucrose) on morphological survival and development in vitro were studied. The survival and development of embryos frozen with best concentration of each cryoprotectant pre-exposed to either a low concentration (1.5 mol/L with 0.25 mol/L sucrose) of the respective cryoprotectant or ascending concentrations of sucrose were also compared. The in vivo development of embryos frozen with best protocol (pre-exposure to 1.5 mol followed by 7.0 mol ethylene glycol) was compared with nonfrozen embryos. The rate of re-expansion and hatching was influenced by the type and concentration of the cryoprotectant. A significantly higher re-expansion and hatching rate was achieved at 7.0 mol of both cryoprotectants compared with 4.5 and 6.0 mol of the respective cryoprotectants. When comparing 2 cryoprotectants, a higher (P < 0.05) rate of hatching was obtained with ethylene glycol at 7.0 mol compared with a similar concentration of propylene glycol. The highest re-expansion (91%) and hatching (86%) of expanded blastocysts was achieved with pre-exposure of embryos to a low concentration of ethylene glycol followed by freezing in the same cryoprotectant at 7.0 mol. The transfer of embryos frozen using this protocol resulted in the development of live fetuses. The proportion of live fetuses in the pregnant recipients with frozen-thawed embryos were not different from those transferred nonfrozen embryos (49 vs 57%). It may be concluded that simple rapid-freezing with dehydration in ascending sucrose concentrations or pre-equilibration in a low concentration of ethylene glycol or propylene glycol followed by exposure to the respective cryoprotectant at 7.0 mol resulted in high survival and development of expanded blastocysts. Ethylene glycol at 7.0 mol with preequilibration is, however, most effective for cryopreservation of this stage in the mouse. 3afreezing 3aviability 3apregnancy rate 3asucrose 3acryoprotectants 3aethylene glycol 3ablastocyst 3amice 3aembryo transfer 3aembryogenesis 3aembryo culture 2aAnimals 2aBlastocystxphysiology 2aCryopreservationxmethods 2aCryoprotective Agentsxadministration & dosagexpharmacology. 2aEmbryo Transfer 2aEmbryonic and Fetal Development 2aEthylene Glycolxadministration & dosagexpharmacology. 2aFemale 2aMice 2aPregnancy 2aPropylene Glycolxadministration & dosagexpharmacology. 0aembryo (animal)1 aBrem, G.0 tTheriogenology.g1998 Nov., v. 50, no. 7 p.1001-1013x0093-691X7nnas  aDNAL  a19990531b19990608c00000000  aINDdJIT  aOther US 7aarticle02777naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001400145245016200159300001600321520140700337650001101744650004401755650001501799650001201814650001501826650001401841650002201855650001201877650001801889650001101907650001901918650000901937700001201946700001701958700001501975700001501990700001202005700001402017700002002031700001902051700001302070773012402083856004602207856004502253852000902298655001202307IND60772653720221117200940.0220406s2021    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077265372DNAL7 a10.13073/FPJ-D-21-000152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Yan10aFourier-Transform Infrared Spectroscopy Analysis of the Changes in Chemical Composition of Wooden Components: Part II—The Ancient Building of Danxia Temple  ap. 283-289.  aTo investigate the decay extent of wooden components in the ancient buildings of Danxia Temple, the absorption peak intensities, changes in chemical components, and cellulose crystallinity of red oak (Quercus sp.), birch (Betula sp.), and maple (Pterocarya sp.) wooden components were determined and analyzed using Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy. The results are as follows: (1) The absorption peak intensities representing cellulose and hemicellulose decreased or disappeared obviously in the decayed red oak wood (DROW); on the contrary, those representing lignin increased. The indexes of the content of cellulose, hemicellulose, and cellulose crystallinity also decreased; on the contrary, those of the content of lignin increased. Those results indicated that cellulose and hemicellulose in DROW were largely degraded by brown-rot fungi. (2) The absorption peak intensities representing cellulose and hemicellulose decreased both in the decayed birch wood (DBW) and the decayed maple wood (DMW), whereas those representing lignin increased. The indexes of the content of cellulose, hemicellulose, and cellulose crystallinity also decreased, whereas those of lignin increased. Those results showed that cellulose and hemicellulose in DBW and DMW were seriously harmed not only by insects but also by brown-rot fungi. By comparison, the extent of fungal damage was lower in DMW than in DBW. 3aBetula 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aPterocarya 3aQuercus 3aabsorption 3acellulose 3acrystal structure 3aforests 3ahemicellulose 3alignin 3alignin content 3awood1 aSun, He1 aYang, Shuang1 aSun, Wenye1 aZhao, Ying1 aLi, Bin1 aWang, Wei1 aZhang, Xiaoqian1 aJiang, Shilong1 aXu, Qian0 tForest products journal.g2021, v. 71, no. 3 p.283-289d[Forest Products Society, etc.]wJournal:12175x0015-74737nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.13073/FPJ-D-21-0001540uhttp://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/7726537  aDNAL 7aarticle02690naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001900145245010800164300001600272520145800288650001001746650002501756650001601781650001201797650002501809650002301834650002001857650002501877650001701902700002001919700001701939700002401956700001901980700001601999700002302015700001802038773012402056856004602180856004502226852000902271655001202280IND60772653620221117195407.0220406s2021    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077265362DNAL7 a10.13073/FPJ-D-21-000302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKojima, Yoichi10aEvaluation of the Mechanical and Physical Properties of Insulation Fiberboard with Cellulose Nanofibers  ap. 275-282.  aThe objective of this study was to investigate the lab-scale manufacturing process of insulation fiberboard (IFB) with cellulose nanofibers (CNFs) and evaluate the effects of CNFs on the mechanical and physical properties of the IFB. Because the fabricated IFBs with CNFs had a homogeneous appearance, it was assumed that CNFs can be easily dispersed within IFB by adding them during the mixing stage of the wet process of wood-based board production. The results for the IFBs with CNFs revealed that the density and bending properties increased, while the thickness decreased with an increase in the CNF addition ratio. Furthermore, after the water absorption test, the weight change rates of the IFBs decreased, and the thickness swelling rates increased. Although the size of the specimens was different from the size in JIS A 5905 (Japan Standards Association 2014), the modulus of rupture (MOR) values of IFBs with a target density more than or equal to 0.20 g/cm3 were higher than the value of A-class IFB in the standard for all CNF addition ratios. In addition, lower thermal conductivity may be realized under similar MOR values by adding CNFs to IFB. On the other hand, to produce CNF-reinforced IFBs with target density/thickness, it is necessary to develop a method for decreasing the cohesive force derived from CNF aggregation and the compressive force originating from the water surface tension caused by the high water retention of CNFs. 3aJapan 3acellulose nanofibers 3afiberboards 3aforests 3ainsulating materials 3amodulus of rupture 3asurface tension 3athermal conductivity 3awater uptake1 aMakino, Tetsuya1 aOta, Kazuaki1 aMurayama, Kazushige1 aKobori, Hikaru1 aAoki, Kenji1 aSuzuki, Shigenhiko1 aIto, Hirokazu0 tForest products journal.g2021, v. 71, no. 3 p.275-282d[Forest Products Society, etc.]wJournal:12175x0015-74737nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.13073/FPJ-D-21-0003040uhttp://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/7726536  aDNAL 7aarticle02688naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001800145245012500163300001600288520163200304650002801936650001201964650001401976650001401990650001502004650001202019650001602031700001602047700001902063700001502082700001702097773012402114856004602238856004502284852000902329655001202338IND60772653920221117195335.0220406s2021    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077265392DNAL7 a10.13073/FPJ-D-21-000342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKang, Huiling10aHeartwood and Sapwood Variation and Development in Chenshan Red-Heart Chinese Fir (Cunninghamia lanceolata (Lamb.) Hook)  ap. 299-308.  aChenshan red-heart Chinese fir is a provenance of Cunninghamia lanceolata, with high-value red heartwood, which is widely used in high-quality furniture and construction. Yet, there is still little information on heartwood development of this tree for high-value decorative timber, which is essential to improve one's plantation management strategy. Here, we investigated the horizontal and vertical variation of heartwood and sapwood and simulated heartwood formation process using stem analysis method. We selected 15 sample trees from five plots of 20 m × 30 m in Chenshan red-heart Chinese fir plantations (9, 15, 26, 29, and 34 years old, respectively). The results showed that Chenshan red-heart Chinese fir stems began to form heartwood when the xylem diameter reached 4 to 8 cm. The heartwood diameter and area, as well as the sapwood area, all increased in the different-aged Chenshan red-heart Chinese firs with increasing xylem diameter and decreased with increasing tree height. As tree height increased, the red heartwood formation rate declined at all ages. Relationship analysis showed that xylem diameter was the most important factor influencing heartwood formation. Red heartwood rate at breast height could be modeled by logistic models. We concluded that heartwood formation began at about 7 years old, and the formation rate increased until peaking at 60 percent at 40 years old. In conclusion, it will be imperative to prolong the Chenshan red-heart Chinese fir rotation period from the currently common 25 years to about 40 years to achieve the maximum sustainable yield of high-value decorative timber. 3aCunninghamia lanceolata 3aforests 3afurniture 3aheartwood 3aprovenance 3asapwood 3atree height1 aWen, Xuding1 aDeng, Xiangwen1 aMa, Yukun,1 aXiao, Fuming0 tForest products journal.g2021, v. 71, no. 4 p.299-308d[Forest Products Society, etc.]wJournal:12175x0015-74737nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.13073/FPJ-D-21-0003440uhttp://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/7726539  aDNAL 7aarticle01933naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001800110245014200128300001600270520095200286650002401238650001701262650001901279650001201298650002201310650002001332650001101352653002801363653001101391653001201402700001701414773008601431852000901517930003301526945001301559946001101572655001201583IND2036069120221117200616.0931202e199307  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND203606912DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKobayashi, M.10aBreakdown of indirect flight muscles of alate aphids (Acyrthosiphon pisum) in relation to their flight, feeding and reproductive behavior  ap. 549-554.  aAlatae of the pea aphid, in contrast to apterae, decreased their body weight for the first 2 days after the final ecdysis. The protein content of their indirect flight muscle increased in inverse proportion to the body weight. When the protein content of the flight muscles attained the maximum on day 2, alatae took off for the flight. Immediately after this, the protein content of the flight muscles and the body weight tended to decrease and increase, respectively, followed by the onset of larviposition. Histological studies indicated that the decline of the protein content of the indirect flight muscles is paralleled with its breakdown. When alatae were kept off the host plant after the final ecdysis, the breakdown of their flight muscles was prevented even after the flight, and few larvipositions followed. Feeding them induced both the breakdown of the muscles and the increase in body weight, followed by the onset of larviposition. 3aAcyrthosiphon pisum 3abody protein 3aflight muscles 3ahistory 3amuscle physiology 3aprotein content 3amorphs 0areproductive physiology 0aalatae 0aapterae1 aIshikawa, H.0 tJournal of insect physiology.g1993 July, v. 39, no. 7 p.549-554x0022-19107nnas  aDNAL  a19940105b19940110c00000000  aINDdADS  aNon-US 7aarticle01917naa a2200313 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001300110245013200123300001600255520101000271650003001281650001801311650001901329650001901348650001101367650001001378650002201388653001201410653001701422773008601439852000901525930003301534945001301567946001101580655001201591IND2036069220221117200154.0931202e199307  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND203606922DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLin, JT.10aIdentification of photoreceptor locations in the compound eye of Coccinella septempunctata Linnaeus (Coleoptera, Coccinellidae)  ap. 555-562.  aThree spectral types of photoreceptor with sensitivity maxima in the 360 nm (u.v. light), 420 nm (blue light) and 520 nm (green light) were characterized in the compound eye of Coccinella septempunctata Linnaeus by intracellular electro-physiological recording.

Referring the longitudinal direction (Y-axis) of the compound eye as 0 degree, the e-vector of polarized fight giving maximal sensitivity were 45 degrees for the u.v. receptor, 75 degrees for the blue receptor, 45 and 1350 for the green receptor. These values were compared to the angles between the Y-axis of the compound eye and the microvillar directions in the rhabdomeres of eight retinula cells.

However, the system is not universally applicable and requires a higher standard of overall management than ploughing, the conventional form of tillage, particularly with respect to maintenance of yield and soil structure, straw and stubble treatment, grass weed and slug control. As such reduced tillage systems are non-prescriptive and require new ways of learning compared to more simple conventional techniques. This article examines the technical and social dimensions of such learning through a study of farmers practicing reduced tillage in England. Semi-structured face-to-face interviews were carried out with 12 farmers implementing reduced tillage and four promoters associated with an initiative supporting them. The results show that a community of reduced tillage farmers, motivated by different interests, has been emerging in England. Individual farmers are learning at the farm level through experimentation and adaptation, and have used a variety of networking devices to take this learning and validate and reflect on it by interacting with others with the same experiences. The networks were also found to extend to researchers and some agronomists. Thus the individual activity of on-farm learning, the technical dimension, is accompanied and enhanced by a process of social learning, the social dimension. However, there are barriers to this social learning, which themselves are intimately connected with the technical complexities of the system. The results show that not all farmers are willing to share their experiences. The difficult nature of reduced tillage, and the high management standards needed to implement it well, has made some farmers reluctant to engage in networks due to fear of criticism from other farmers, desire to protect their new found knowledge from competitors, or poor regard for the standards of farmers new to the system. 3afarmers 3ainnovation adoption 3areduced tillage 3afarm management 3aplowing 3acrop yield 3asoil structure 3acrop residue management 3aweed control 3aagricultural education 3asocial networks 3afarmers' attitudes 3avalidity 3aagronomists 3aon-farm research 3asocial environment 3asocial behavior 3asocial barriers 3aEngland0 tJournal of sustainable agriculture.g2010 , v. 34, no. 1-2 p.183-201x1044-00467nnas  aDNAL  a20100513b20100605c00000000  aINDd2CTe2010/04/23  aOther US 7aarticle03104naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092040001800119100002400137245012500161300001800286500002400304500001500328520163100343650001501974650001101989650001102000650001602011650002802027650002602055650002502081650002002106650001502126650001102141650002402152650001502176650001302191650001402204650001502218650001502233650002402248650001702272653001802289700001202307700001802319700002102337700002102358773013302379852000902512856007702521655001202598IND4422202120221117200555.0090619s2009    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442220212DNAL7 a10.1002/jctb.21372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDanquah, Michael K.10aDewatering of microalgal culture for biodiesel production: exploring polymer flocculation and tangential flow filtration  ap. 1078-1083.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-05  aBACKGROUND: Conventional biodiesel production relies on trans-esterification of lipids extracted from vegetable crops. However, the use of valuable vegetable food stocks as raw material for biodiesel production makes it an unfeasibly expensive process. Used cooking oil is a finite resource and requires extra downstream processing, which affects the amount of biodiesel that can be produced and the economics of the process. Lipids extracted from microalgae are considered an alternative raw material for biodiesel production. This is primarily due to the fast growth rate of these species in a simple aquaculture environment. However, the dilute nature of microalgae culture puts a huge economic burden on the dewatering process especially on an industrial scale. This current study explores the performance and economic viability of chemical flocculation and tangential flow filtration (TFF) for the dewatering of Tetraselmis suecica microalgae culture.RESULT: Results show that TFF concentrates the microalgae feedstock up to 148 times by consuming 2.06 kWh m⁻³ of energy while flocculation consumes 14.81 kWh m⁻³ to concentrate the microalgae up to 357 times. Economic evaluation demonstrates that even though TFF has higher initial capital investment than polymer flocculation, the payback period for TFF at the upper extreme of microalgae revenue is ~1.5 years while that of flocculation is ~3 years.CONCLUSION: These results illustrate that improved dewatering levels can be achieved more economically by employing TFF. The performances of these two techniques are also compared with other dewatering techniques. 3avegetables 3aincome 3aenergy 3aaquaculture 3aeconomic sustainability 3acooking fats and oils 3aeconomic performance 3avegetable crops 3adewatering 3alipids 3aeconomic investment 3afiltration 3apolymers 3abiodiesel 3afeedstocks 3amicroalgae 3aTetraselmis suecica 3aflocculation 0araw materials1 aAng, Li1 aUduman, Nyomi1 aMoheimani, Navid1 aForde, Gareth M.0 tJournal of chemical technology and biotechnology.g2009 July, v. 84, no. 7 p.1078-1083dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.x0268-25757nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jctb.21373Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02149naa a2200289 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002000110245012000130300001800250520129000268650002601558650001401584650001701598653002901615700001601644700001801660700001401678773008901692852000901781930003301790945001301823946001101836655001201847IND2038180520221117200528.0940323e199312  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND203818052DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStankiewicz, M.10aTransient K+ current and periaxonal potassium accumulation in the giant axon of the cockroach Periplaneta americana  ap. 1075-1082.  aPotassium currents were studied under voltage-clamp conditions in the cockroach isolated giant axon in the presence of 10(-7) M tetrodotoxin. At room temperature, a transient K+ current (inactivation time constant approximately 5 ms at +30 mV), having characteristics similar to the I(A) current, could be activated if the holding potential (HP) was maintained at values negative to -70 mV. This current was not present at HP -50 mV or if the test pulse applied from a negative HP was preceded by an approximate 15-20 ms conditioning predepolarization to -40 mV. Although this transient current could be attributed to the existence of inactivating K+ channels, the current decrease during a voltage pulse could be likely explained by the external K+ accumulation in the periaxonal space, revealed by the instantaneous K+ tail current analysis. Even though the K+ accumulation in the isolated cockroach axon is less than in many similar preparations, it can increase the external K+ concentration by a factor of 10 under the experimental conditions and shift the equilibrium potential for K+ ions by 30-50 mV towards positive values at the end of a 35 ms voltage pulse to +30 mV. Thus, the accumulation phenomena should always be taken into account in the studies of ionic conductances. 3aPeriplaneta americana 3apotassium 3anerve tissue 0aaxonal potassium current1 aPelhate, M.1 aMalecot, C.O.1 aDuval, A.0 tJournal of insect physiology.g1993 Dec., v. 39, no. 12 p.1075-1082x0022-19107nnas  aDNAL  a19940415b19940418c00000000  aINDdTLX  aNon-US 7aarticle01653naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002900110245012500139300001600264520070900280650001200989650002001001650002301021650001701044650001601061650001601077650001801093650002001111653001201131700001901143773008701162852000901249930003301258945001301291946001101304655001201315IND2037599420221117200522.0940301e199310  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND203759942DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFernandes-da-Silva, P.G.14aThe influence of host nutritive value on the performance and food selection in Ceratitis capitata (Diptera, Tephritidae)  ap. 883-887.  aOne of the purposes of this study was to verify the nutritive value of different parts of the same fruit for larvae of Ceratitis capitata; another was to ascertain if the larvae select the part of the fruit with better nutritive value, and also if the females prefer to oviposit in it.

The cellular reactions of the haemocytes--investigated by light and scanning electron microscopy-comprised degranulation of granular cells and phagocytosis by plasmatocytes. The humoral responses measured in cell free haemolymph as the increase of antibacterial activity against Echerichia coli K12 D31 and of lysozyme activity against Micrococcus luteas cell walls-were significantly enhanced in comparison to controls. Only hydrophylic but not hydrophobic silica beads provoked strong reactions. Plasmatocytes (PLs), the main phagocytic haemocytes of G. mellonella, were isolated by using a newly adapted nylon wool column technique. PL monolayers, prepared from isolated cells, exhibited a high purity by consisting of at least 90% PL. Scanning electron microscopy studies revealed that 64% of the isolated PLs showed phagocytic activity against the sterile silica beads in vitro. Intrahaemocoelic injection of supernatants from monolayers with phagocytosing plasmatocytes into naive larvae led to a clearly higher antibacterial activity against E. coli in haemolymph of recipients than the injection of supernatants from monolayers with non-phagocytosing cells. The earlier supposition that haemocyte-released factors induce the humoral immune response is further supported by these results. 3aGalleria mellonella 3alarvae 3aphagocytosis 3ahemocytes 3ahumoral immunity 3aEscherichia coli 3aforeign bodies 3aMicrococcus luteus 3asilica1 aGotz, P.0 tJournal of insect physiology.g1993 Oct., v. 39, no. 10 p.865-876x0022-19107nnas  aDNAL  a19940415b19940418c00000000  aINDdADS  aNon-US 7aarticle01471naa a2200253 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003200092040001800124100001800142245008000160300001600240500002400256520066500280650001800945650001300963650001500976700001800991773010501009852000901114856008201123655001201205IND4422199120221117201035.0090619s2009    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442219912DNAL7 a10.1002/jobm.2008002222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRaj, S.

We observed that the bottleneck associated with the use of different peptones for bR production was linked to the presence of tryptophan (Trp). Trp at 0.36 mM in the culture medium inhibits bR formation. The results obtained in this study demonstrate that bR content (mg l⁻¹) of Halorubrum sodomense A01 decreased to 2.9 mg l⁻¹ in 0.36 mM Trp compared to control (0.11 mM Trp) where 12.3 mg l⁻¹ of bR was obtained. Our results provide useful information for the design of production conditions for bR to be used in applied settings. (© 2009 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

In the present study, we have focused on the environmental regulation of futC transcription in the model organism Synechocystis sp. strain PCC 6803 and, moreover, studied the transcriptional regulation of the other transporter subunits, futA1, futA2 and futB. The steady-state amounts of the futA1, futA2, futB and futC transcripts were regulated under several conditions studied including darkness, temperature, alternative nitrogen source, salt and osmotic stresses and iron deficiency. Transcription of all subunits of the FutABC-iron transporter seems to be under similar regulation, which, according to our results, may also apply to genes encoding subunits of other transporters in Synechocystis. The sequence alignment, including sequences from six different organisms, revealed the conserved nature of FutC. Based on the sequence alignment and the structural model of FutC, the monomer consists of a nucleotide-binding domain (NBD) and a regulatory domain. The NBD is well conserved indicating completely functional ATP binding. 3aSynechocystis 3aadenosine triphosphate 3agenes 3airon 3amodels 3anitrogen 3anutrient deficiencies 3aorganisms 3aosmotic stress 3asequence alignment 3atemperature 3atranscription (genetics) 3atransporters1 aRaksajit, Wuttinun1 aMulo, Paula1 aIncharoensakdi, Aran1 aSalminen, Tiina A.1 aMäenpää, Pirkko0 tArchives of microbiology.g2009 July, v. 191, no. 7 p.561-570dSpringer-Verlagx0302-89337nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00203-009-0482-y3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02510naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001400164245006700178300001600245500002400261520110300285650001501388650002701403650002001430650002201450650001201472650001101484650000901495650001001504650001701514650002001531650000701551650001001558650001501568650001201583650005201595650003501647650001101682650002101693650002101714650002201735700001601757700001301773700001401786773011001800852000901910856008501919655001202004IND4422139520221117200353.0090619s2009    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442213952DNAL7 a191946692pmid7 a10.1007/s12011-009-8327-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYu, D.

The results showed that the adsorbability of Cu-MMT onto Cd is stronger than the MMT. The amount of Cu-MMT necessary to remove Cd from solution was about 0.5 g for 100-200 mg/L Cd solution at a pH of 4.0. The maximum adsorption (94%) was 20 min of shaking time using Cu-MMT as adsorbent. The maximum adsorption of Cd = 95% at a pH of 4.0. By increasing the initial concentration, the adsorption amount of Cd onto Cu-MMT increased. Animal experiment of this study indicated that the addition of Cu-MMT to the Cd-contaminated diet of pigs reduced significantly the Cd levels in tissues (p < 0.05) and increased contents in feces (p < 0.01), improving the safety of animal products.

In this study, the full-length BlDnaK and its T86W and three C-terminally truncated mutants were constructed to evaluate the role of up to C-terminal 255 amino acids of the protein. The steady-state ATPase activity for BlDnaK, T86W, T86W/ΔC120, T86W/ΔC249, and T86W/ΔC255 was 65.68, 53.21, 116.04, 321.38, and 90.59 nmol Pi/min per mg, respectively. In vivo, BldnaK, T86W and T86W/ΔC120 genes allowed an E. coli dnaK756-ts mutant to grow at 44°C. Except for T86W/ΔC255, simultaneous addition of B. licheniformis DnaJ and GrpE, and NR-peptide synergistically stimulated the ATPase activity of BlDnaK, T86W, T86W/ΔC120, and T86W/ΔC249 by 16.9-, 13.9-, 33.9-, 9.9-fold, respectively. Measurement of intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence revealed significant alterations of microenvironment of aromatic amino acids in the C-terminally truncated mutants. The temperature-dependent signal in the far-UV region for T86W was consistent with that of BlDnaK, but the C-terminally truncated mutant proteins showed a higher sensitivity toward temperature-induced denaturation. These results suggest that C-terminal truncations alter the ATPase activity and thermal stability of BlDnaK and induce the conformation change of the ATPase domain. 3aBacillus licheniformis 3aEscherichia coli 3aadenosinetriphosphatase 3adenaturation 3afluorescence 3agenes 3amolecular chaperones 3amutants 3athermal stability 3atryptophan1 aLin, Min-Guan1 aChi, Meng-Chun1 aHu, Hui-Yu1 aLo, Huei-Fen1 aChang, Hui-Ping1 aLin, Long-Liu0 tArchives of microbiology.g2009 July, v. 191, no. 7 p.583-593dSpringer-Verlagx0302-89337nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00203-009-0485-83Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle01768naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002100145245010500166300001400271500002400285520063200309650001800941650002000959650001200979650003000991650001301021650000901034650000901043650001701052700001901069700002201088700002301110700002201133700002101155773012401176852000901300856008501309655001201394IND4422132620221117200346.0090619s2009    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442213262DNAL7 a10.3103/S00963925090200352doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBelyaeva, Yu.

Inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy was used to estimate the contents of Al, Ca, Cd, Cr, Cu, Fe, K, Mg, Mn, Na, P, Pb, and Zn in healthy kidney and renal cell carcinoma (RCC), and significant differences were found for all elements. Along with the progression of the malignant disease, a progressive decrease of Cd and K was observed. In fact, for Cd, the concentration in stage T4 was 263.9 times lower than in stage T1, and for K, the concentration in stage T4 was 1.73 times lower than in stage T1. Progressive accumulation was detected for P, Pb, and Zn in stage T4. For P, the concentration in stage T4 was 11.1 times higher than in stage T1; for Pb, the concentration in stage T4 was 232.7 times higher than in T1; and for Zn, the concentration in T4 was 8.452 times higher than in T1. This study highlights the marked differences in the concentrations of selected trace metals in different malignant tumor stages. These findings indicate that some trace metals may play important roles in the pathogenesis of RCC. 3aaluminum 3acadmium 3acalcium 3acarcinoma 3achromium 3acopper 3airon 3akidneys 3alead 3amagnesium 3amanganese 3apathogenesis 3asodium 3aspectroscopy 3azinc 2aAged 2aAged, 80 and over 2aCarcinoma, Renal Cellxmetabolism 2aFemale 2aHumans 2aKidneyxmetabolism 2aKidney Neoplasmsxmetabolism 2aMale 2aMiddle Aged 2aTrace Elementsxanalysisxmetabolism.1 aSantos Junior, Dário1 aRodrigues, Consuelo Junqueira1 aKrug, Francisco José.1 aMarumo, Júlio Takehiro1 aSchor, Nestor1 aBellini, Maria Helena0 tBiological trace element research.g2009 Aug., v. 130, no. 2 p.107-113dHumana Press Incx0163-49847nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12011-009-8325-x3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle01730naa a2200289 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001500110245010700125300001500232520088000247650002301127650002701150650002701177650001201204650001101216653003501227700001501262773008501277852000901362930003301371945001301404946001101417655001201428IND2039936820221117200058.0940601e199402  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND203993682DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKutsch, W.10aOntogenetic studies of flight initiation in Locusta: wind response of an identified interneurone (TCG)  ap. 97-106.  aThe tritocerebral commissure giant (TCG) wind-sensitive interneurone is involved in initiation and maintenance of flight in adult locusts. in this paper we study this interneurone in the imago and non-flying larval instars. Cobalt fills show that the TCG establishes its adult morphology by the first larval instar. An accompanying axon, apparently representing the peculiar tritocerebral commissure "dwarf" (TCD) is present, too, at least for the last preimaginal instars. Physiological tests show similar responses of the TCG to wind stimuli in the 4th, 5th instar and adult stages. Spike activity, however, is usually higher in adult compared to larval instars. It is possible that afl interneurones, involved in adult-specific motor patterns (such as flight), are present in preimaginal stages and can be activated independently of the function of the final motor system. 3aLocusta migratoria 3acentral nervous system 3abiological development 3aneurons 3aflight 0atritocerebral commissure giant1 aHemmer, W.0 tJournal of insect physiology.g1994 Feb., v. 40, no. 2 p.97-106x0022-19107nnas  aDNAL  a19940720b19940722c00000000  aINDdTLX  aNon-US 7aarticle03111naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245014200127300001400269520215300283650001802436650001102454650001102465650001402476650001202490650001102502650001302513653001102526653001402537700001602551700001502567700001702582773008402599852000902683930003302692945001302725946001102738655001202749IND2039841620221117200114.0940526e199401  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND203984162DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSacchi, V.F.10aInteraction between Na+ and the K+-dependent amino acid transport in midgut brush-border membrane vesicles from Philosamia cynthia larvae  ap. 69-74.  aBoth sodium and potassium can drive leucine uptake into brush-border membrane vesicles from Philosamia cynthia midgut, but the effects of these cations are not additive. 2 mM sodium reduces leucine uptake at saturating potassium concentrations, which indicates that these cations interact with the same transporter. The mixed type inhibition of sodium as explained in terms of different kinetic parameters of the co-transporter when this cation binds to the transport protein instead of potassium. At 0.2 mM leucine, the affinity of sodium for the transporter was about 18 times that of potassium, whereas leucine Vmax was 2.5 times higher with potassium. Kinetic experiments performed to characterize Na(+)-dependent leucine uptake showed that the leucine kinetics at different sodium concentrations did not follow Michaelis-Menten kinetics and that the effect of sodium was mainly to increase the affinity of the amino acid for the co-transporter. Na(+)-activation curves, at fixed leucine concentrations, showed that the Vmax increased with leucine concentration. Since both cations are present in the midgut lumen of P. cynthia larva (200 mM potassium and 1 mM sodium), the interaction between sodium and the K(+)-dependent co-transporter was observed by measuring leucine uptake as a function of potassium concentration at different fixed sodium concentrations. In accordance with the kinetic parameters that characterize the co-transport in the presence of either Na+ or K+, sodium reduces leucine uptake at high potassium concentrations and increases leucine uptake at low potassium concentrations. Assuming that the translocation is the rate limiting step of the process, we present a model for two alternative drivers (Na+ and K+) and for leucine translocation in the absence of any cation. The derived velocity equation adequately describes the experiments reported here and previously. The physiological meaning of this transport mechanism, probably evolved from a more primitive Na(+)-dependent co-transport, is discussed and its role in ensuring sodium intake, in an epithelium which contains no conventional sodium pump, is suggested. 3aSamia cynthia 3amidgut 3asodium 3apotassium 3aleucine 3alarvae 3akinetics 0auptake 0amembranes1 aParenti, P.1 aPerego, C.1 aGiordana, B.0 tJournal of insect physiology.g1994 Jan., v. 40, no. 1 p.69-74x0022-19107nnas  aDNAL  a19940720b19940722c00000000  aINDdTLX  aNon-US 7aarticle03147naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001600145245010300161300001400264500001500278520163500293592002801928650003901956650001401995650001802009650003002027650001602057650002802073650001902101650001002120650002402130650000802154650002202162650002002184653003302204653002602237653001002263653003102273653003102304653003602335700001402371700001702385700001202402700001602414700001402430773010702444856008102551852000902632655001202641IND60479880620221119204527.0160123e20090301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6047988062DNAL7 a10.1556/CRC.37.2009.1.22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, C.

Wheat expressed sequence tag (EST) sequences are valuable for developing molecular markers since ESTs are derived from gene transcripts and more likely to be conserved between wheat and its relative species. In the present study, 35 sequence-tagged site (STS) primers were designed based on EST sequences distributed on homology group 1 chromosomes of <i>Triticum aestivum</i> and used to screen specific markers for chromosome 1RS of <i>Secale cereale</i> . Two primer pairs different from the early studies, STS <sub>WE3</sub> , which amplified a 1680-bp and a 1750-bp fragment, and STS <sub>WE126</sub> , which produced a 850-bp fragment from rye genome, were proved to be specific to chromosome 1RS since the corresponding fragments were only amplified from 1R chromosome addition line and wheat-rye lines with chromosome 1RS, but not from wheat-rye 2R-7R chromosome addition lines and the other lines lacking chromosome 1RS. Eleven wheat-rye lines derived from ‘Xiaoyan 6’ and ‘German White’ were used to test the presence of specific markers for 1RS. The specific fragments of 1RS were amplified in 4 wheat-rye lines, but not in the other lines. The testing results using EST-STS markers of 1RS were consistent with those obtained from fluorescence <i>in situ</i> hybridization (FISH), suggesting that these markers specific to 1RS could be used in marker-assisted selection (MAS) for incorporating 1RS into wheat cultivars in breeding.  aPublisher supplied data 3afluorescence in situ hybridization 3acultivars 3amessenger RNA 3amarker-assisted selection 3achromosomes 3aexpressed sequence tags 3aSecale cereale 3awheat 3achromosome addition 3arye 3aTriticum aestivum 3agenetic markers 0aexpressed sequence tag (EST) 0a<i>Secale cereale</i> 0agenes 0achromosome specific marker 0asequence-tagged site (STS) 0amarker-assisted selection (MAS)1 aLi, L.

However, in the past two decades, BAGs have been explored immensely by several researchers worldwide as a multifunctional delivery system for a multitude of therapeutics ranging from metal ions to small molecules (e.g., drugs) and macromolecules (e.g., DNA). The impetus for devising a BAG-based delivery system in the 21st century is based upon the facilitative properties it offers for entrapment of a wide range of therapeutic molecules and the tailorable controlled release kinetics to the target tissue site along with the biological activity of the ionic dissolution products in several pathological conditions such as osteoporosis, cancer, infection, and inflammation. This review comprises two parts: the first part discusses the need for a new delivery system and how the journey from melt quench progressed towards template-based sol-gel mesoporous. In the second part, we have comprehended the scientific advancements made so far, emphasizing BAGs as a delivery system ranging from therapeutic ions to phytopharmaceuticals. We have also highlighted a few loopholes that have prevented bench-to-bedside clinical translation of a plethora of elucidative researches done so far.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3abioactive properties 3aglass 3ainflammation 3aorthopedics 3aosteoporosis 3aphytopharmaceuticals 3aporous media 3atherapeutics 0aBioactive glass 0aDrug-delivery systems 0aDopant ions 0aOsteogenesis 0aPhytopharmaceuticals 0aGene delivery vector1 aMajumdar, Shreyasi1 aKrishnamurthy, Sairam0 tJournal of controlled release.g2021 July 10, v. 335 p.481-497dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12462x0168-36597nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jconrel.2021.05.0433Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03329naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245018100163300001800344500001900362520178800381592002802169650002602197650001602223650001202239650002202251650001502273650002502288650001402313650000902327650001202336650001302348650001502361650002302376650001202399650002202411650001002433650002102443653002002464653001702484700001802501700002602519700001302545700001802558700001802576773013902594856008102733852000902814655001202823IND60717190920221118222101.0201109e20201214xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071719092DNAL7 a10.1017/S00071145200022142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Songlin10aStarch in aquafeeds: the benefits of a high amylose to amylopectin ratio and resistant starch content in diets for the carnivorous fish, largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides)  ap. 1145-1155.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aAquafeeds for carnivorous species face a nutritional–technological conundrum: containing sufficient starch to meet specific manufacturing requirements for binding, extrusion and expansion, but ideally containing as little starch as possible owing to their limited ability to utilise carbohydrates. The present study evaluated the effects of dietary starch with different amylose to amylopectin ratios and resistant starch contents on growth performance, hepatic glycogen accumulation and glucose metabolism of an important cultured carnivorous finfish, largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides). A common starch source (α-cassava starch (CS)) was tested as is or after being enzymatically de-branched at three different inclusion levels in diets for largemouth bass. Results showed that the increased dietary starch levels compromised performance and high dietary α-CS content led to obvious liver damage. However, the growth performances of fish fed the diets with de-branched starch (DS) were improved, and no manifest liver damages were observed even at the higher inclusion level. The increasing dietary starch contents significantly increased hepatic glycogen accumulation, but not when DS was used. High dietary starch content, without regard to starch sources, had no effect on the expression of glucose metabolism-related genes, except for down-regulation of insulin receptor expression. However, the use of dietary DS promoted the expression of genes involved in the insulin pathway and glycolysis. In conclusion, this study showed that the use of starch sources with a high amylose to amylopectin ratio and resistant starch in the feed for cultured carnivorous finfish could alleviate the hepatic glycogen deposition through regulating the insulin pathway and glycolysis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMicropterus salmoides 3aamylopectin 3aamylose 3aaquaculture feeds 3acarnivores 3adietary carbohydrate 3aextrusion 3afish 3aglucose 3aglycogen 3aglycolysis 3agrowth performance 3ainsulin 3ainsulin receptors 3aliver 3aresistant starch 0aLargemouth bass 0aCarbohydrate1 aSang, Chunyan1 aTurchini, Giovanni M.1 aWang, An1 aZhang, Jiacan1 aChen, Naisong0 tBritish journal of nutrition.g2020 Dec. 14, v. 124, no. 11 p.1145-1155dCambridge University PresswJournal:jnl45200x1475-26627nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S00071145200022143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02588naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245008700167300001800254520147800272592002801750650001501778650001701793650002001810650001901830650001701849650001701866650001501883650002401898700002401922700001601946700001301962700001401975773014701989856008102136852000902217655001202226IND60479880720221119204338.0160123e201602  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6047988072DNAL7 a10.1007/s00216-015-8845-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNilghaz, Azadeh10aRed blood cell transport mechanisms in polyester thread-based blood typing devices  ap. 1365-1371.  aA recently developed blood typing diagnostic based on a polyester thread substrate has shown great promise for use in medical emergencies and in impoverished regions. The device is easy to use and transport, while also being inexpensive, accurate, and rapid. This study used a fluorescent confocal microscope to delve deeper into how red blood cells were behaving within the polyester thread-based diagnostic at the cellular level, and how plasma separation could be made to visibly occur on the thread, making it possible to identify blood type in a single step. Red blood cells were stained and the plasma phase dyed with fluorescent compounds to enable them to be visualised under the confocal microscope at high magnification. The mechanisms uncovered were in surprising contrast with those found for a similar, paper-based method. Red blood cell aggregates did not flow over each other within the thread substrate as expected, but suffered from a restriction to their flow which resulted in the chromatographic separation of the RBCs from the liquid phase of the blood. It is hoped that these results will lead to the optimisation of the method to enable more accurate and sensitive detection, increasing the range of blood systems that can be detected. Graphical Abstract Agglutinated FITC stained A+ blood on anti-A antibody treated thread. Sheet like structures composed of agglutinated RBCs can be seen, wrapped around fibres and occupying the spaces between them.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantibodies 3ablood groups 3acell aggregates 3achromatography 3aerythrocytes 3afluorescence 3apolyesters 3asystem optimization1 aBallerini, David R.1 aGuan, Liyun1 aLi, Lizi1 aShen, Wei0 tAnalytical and bioanalytical chemistry.g2016 Feb., v. 408, no. 5 p.1365-1371dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl3870029x1618-26427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00216-015-8845-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02992naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100002400137245012600161300001600287520175100303592002802054650001402082650003002096650001102126650001102137650001302148650001202161650001402173650001402187650001002201650001002211650000902221650002602230650001402256650001102270650002002281650001602301650001502317650001102332651001302343773011002356856007102466852000902537655001202546IND60518259920221122060053.0160411e196902  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051825992DNAL7 a10.2307/19423562doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHurlbert, Stuart H.14aThe Breeding Migrations and Interhabitat Wandering of the Vermilion‐Spotted Newt Notophthalmus viridescens (Rafinesque)  ap. 465-488.  aThe breeding migrations and wandering movements of Notophthalmus viridescens were monitored at several ponds in Dryden, Tompkins County, New York. Breeding migrations occurred in both the spring (April—May) and fall (August—October, November, or December) to all permanent ponds. The spring migrations involved both eft migrants and adult migrants, their relative numbers varying considerably from pond to pond. The fall migrations involved eft migrants almost exclusively. Eft migrants were maturing juveniles returning to the water for the first time; adult migrants were individuals which had bred before and subsequently spent some time, often an entire winter, on land. The sex ratio of eft migrants was 42 to 47% males, that of aquatic adults at least 55% males; male eft migrants had a greater future life expectancy than do female eft migrants. Male migrants arrived earlier in the spring, female migrants arrived earlier in the fall. Breeding migrants tended to use linear depressions (e.g. streambeds, slope junctions) as migration routes; their routes were conspicuously altered by seasonal changed in vegetation. About 57% of N. viridescens migrants, but only 3% of Ambystoma maculatum migrants, reached the ponds during the day; the remainder entered at night. Breeding migrations were more strongly correlated with rainfall and temperature in early spring than in late spring and in late fall than in early fall. For a brief period following their arrival at a pond migrants wandered back and forth between water and land, especially during rainy weather. Fully aquatic adults abandoned temporary ponds as or after these dried up. In July, August, and September some adults left permanent ponds, especially during rainy weather.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAmbystoma 3aNotophthalmus viridescens 3aadults 3aautumn 3abreeding 3afemales 3ajuveniles 3alongevity 3amales 3aponds 3arain 3asalamanders and newts 3asex ratio 3aspring 3astream channels 3atemperature 3avegetation 3awinter 3aNew York0 tEcological monographs.g1969 Feb., v. 39, no. 4 p.465-488dEcological Society of Americax0012-96157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2307/19423563Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04110naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002400143245010200167300001600269520263000285592002802915650001802943650001902961650001902980650002002999650002103019650001403040650001803054650002703072650001503099650000903114650001303123650001203136650002203148650001603170650001003186651001203196653002803208653002703236653002803263653002703291653002103318653002503339700001803364700002403382773011103406856007803517852000903595655001203604IND60794540720221120104805.0220925e20220922xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079454072DNAL7 a10.2478/ffp-2022-00162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMeshkova, Valentyna10aColeopterous predators of pine bark beetles in the last years of the outbreak recorded in Ukraine  ap. 161-172.  aThe purpose of this study was to identify the species composition of coleopterous predators and their occurrence in different parts of the stem depending on the health condition of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) in the collapsing foci of bark beetles (Coleoptera: Curculionidae: Scolytinae). The research was carried out in 2019–2021 at 38 sample plots located in five State Forestry Enterprises of Sumy region (Ukraine). All sample plots are located in pure Scots pine stands in relatively poor forest site conditions. The relative density of stocking is 0.6–0.7, and the age of stands is between 60 and 110 years. The health condition for each tree was evaluated on visual characteristics by the classes: first – healthy; second – weakened; third – severely weakened; fourth – drying up; fifth – recently died and sixth – died over a year ago. Bark beetles’ nuptial chambers and predators were counted on 25 × 25 cm pallets, which were located at the lower, middle and upper parts of the stem with thin, thick and transitional bark, respectively. The significance of differences in the performance of predator species depending on the tree part, health condition and year was analysed using the nonparametric Kruskal–Wallis (K–W) test. The species composition of predators in different years, stem parts and tree health condition was compared using the Sorensen–Chekanovsky index. In the collapsing foci of bark beetles, the health condition of Scots pine in 2019–2021 tended to worsen. The infestation density of Ips acuminatus (Gyllenhal, 1827) and Ips sexdentatus (Boerner, 1767) was 0.62 ± 0.032 and 0.64 ± 0.017 nuptial chambers per 1 dm², respectively, and also decreased in 2019–2021. In the galleries of bark beetles, seven species of coleopterous predators were collected: Aulonium ruficorne (Olivier, 1790) (Zopheridae), Platysoma elongatum (Leach, 1817) (Histeridae), Rhizophagus depressus (Fabricius, 1792) (Monotomidae), Corticeus pini (Panzer, 1799) (Tenebrionidae), Thanasimus formicarius (Linnaeus, 1758), Thanasimus femoralis (Zetterstedt, 1828) (Cleridae) and Salpingus ruficollis (Linnaeus, 1761) (Salpingidae). Two more species – Glischrochilus quadripunctatus (Linnaeus, 1758) (Nitidulidae) and Pytho depressus (Linnaeus, 1767) (Pythidae) – were singly collected in the foci. T. formicarius and P. elongatum were the most abundant. The ratio of predator–prey significantly increased from the upper to the lower part of the stem with thick bark. It, however, decreased in this stem part from the fourth to the sixth class of the health condition of the host tree.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCurculionidae 3aGlischrochilus 3aIps acuminatus 3aIps sexdentatus 3aPinus sylvestris 3aPlatysoma 3aTenebrionidae 3aThanasimus formicarius 3aZopheridae 3abark 3aforestry 3aforests 3aspecies diversity 3atree health 3atrees 3aUkraine 0aPinus sylvestris forest 0aSumy region of Ukraine 0afrequency of occurrence 0ahealth condition class 0anuptial chambers 0apredator/prey ratios1 aVorobei, Alla1 aOmelich, Anastasiya0 tFolia forestalia Polonica.g2022 Sept. 22, v. 64, no. 3 p.161-172dSciendowJournal:14917x2199-59077nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2478/ffp-2022-00163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03050naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002400140245013500164300002000299520151200319592002801831650001301859650001201872650001601884650002201900650001401922650002201936650002501958650002501983650001402008650001502022650001702037650001802054650002002072650001902092650002302111650001802134650003102152650002702183650001902210700002502229700002202254700002402276700001902300700001802319773012402337856007402461852000902535655001202544IND60666771320221121153032.0190919e20141002xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066677132DNAL7 a10.1039/c4ra07568d2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBarakat, Abdellatif10aMechanical pretreatments of lignocellulosic biomass: towards facile and environmentally sound technologies for biofuels production  ap. 48109-48127.  aThe transformation of lignocellulosic biomass into biofuels represents an interesting and sustainable alternative to fossil fuel for the near future. However, one still faces some major challenges for the technology to be fully realized including feedstock costs, novel pretreatment processes, production, transportation, and environmental impact of the full chain. The development of new technologies focused to increase the efficiency of cellulose conversion to biofuels determines successful implementation. Mechanical fractionation is an essential step in order to increase final carbohydrate output, appropriate particle sizes and densification, enzymatic accessibility, and bioconversion affectivity without the production of toxic side streams. In this review article, we surveyed a substantial amount of previous work in mechanical fractionation or pretreatments of a variety of lignocellulosic biomasses; these include numerous milling schemes and extrusions, and their impacts on the physical and physicochemical properties of the lignocellulosic matrix (crystallinity, surface area, particle size, etc). We have also compared results with other pure chemical and physicochemical pretreatments in order to show the new aspects and advantages/disadvantages of such an approach. Last, but not least, the effect of mechanical treatment and physical properties on enzymatic hydrolysis and bioconversion has been discussed, with potentially interesting dry lignocellulosic biorefinery schemes proposed.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiofuels 3abiomass 3abiorefining 3abiotransformation 3acellulose 3acrystal structure 3aenvironmental impact 3aenzymatic hydrolysis 3aextrusion 3afeedstocks 3afossil fuels 3afractionation 3afuel production 3alignocellulose 3amechanical methods 3aparticle size 3aphysicochemical properties 3asustainable technology 3atransportation1 aMayer-Laigle, Claire1 aSolhy, Abderrahim1 aArancon, Rick A.

Here, we employed various tertiary amino groups, including different linear, cyclic, and bimolecular drug structures, to modify 3-n-butylphthalide (NBP), a natural product used for ischemic stroke treatment, which has poor bioavailability, to generate a series of six prodrugs. These prodrugs showed significantly improved solubility and cellular uptake, which were primarily driven by putative pyrilamine cationic transporters. They also displayed more efficient brain delivery in vivo, reaching as high as 21.5-fold brain accumulation increase compared with NBP, leading to much higher bioavailability and stronger therapeutic effects. The toxicity of these molecules is also lower or similar to that of unmodified NBP. We showed that the tertiary amino group-modified NBP prodrugs are effective and safe for treating ischemic stroke with significantly enhanced druggability; hence, they have potential for further clinical development.  aPublisher supplied data 3abioavailability 3ablood-brain barrier 3abrain 3adeath 3adrugs 3asolubility 3astroke 3atherapeutics 3atoxicity 0a3-n-butylphthalide 0aIschemic stroke 0aProdrugs 0aBrain-targeting 0aTertiary amino group1 aZhang, Qiang1 aHan, Yikun1 aYang, Lan1 aZhang, Yan1 aLiu, Qiang1 aZhang, Zhirong1 aZhang, Ling0 tJournal of controlled release.g2021 July 10, v. 335 p.498-514dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12462x0168-36597nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jconrel.2021.05.0453Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04392naa a2200985 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003600113040001800149100001700167245019400184300001600378500001500394520163600409592002802045650001202073650002902085650003802114650001802152650001402170650001702184650002602201650001702227650002802244650003002272650001002302650001302312650001302325650001102338650001302349650001102362650002002373650002402393650001702417650000902434650002802443650004102471650001602512650003102528650001102559650001102570650001202581650000902593650002702602650001602629650002602645650004502671653000702716653003702723653000802760653000902768653000902777653000702786653001802793653000902811653004702820653002002867653000702887653003802894653000702932653000702939653000702946700001602953700001802969700001702987700001803004700001603022700001803038700001603056700001303072700001603085700002103101700001903122700001603141700002403157700001503181700001403196700001903210773007403229856008203303852000903385655001203394IND60099040520221116202637.0161021e20130401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009904052DNAL7 a231472642pmid7 a10.1016/j.gene.2012.10.0872doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTong, Yeqing12aA tailed primers protocol to identify the association of eNOS gene variable number of tandem repeats polymorphism with ischemic stroke in Chinese Han population by capillary electrophoresis  ap. 218-223.  a2019-12-06  aEndothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) plays an important role in mediating endothelium-dependent vasodilatation and antithrombotic action and is thus involved in the development of ischemic stroke (IS). Controversial results regarding the association of eNOS gene variable number of tandem repeats (VNTR) polymorphism with IS have been reported by conventional PCR-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis methods. We aimed to identify any common association of eNOS gene VNTR polymorphism with IS in Chinese Han population by capillary electrophoresis (CE). The VNTR polymorphism of 27bp within the eNOS intron-4 was determined by CE with specially designed tailed primers in Chinese Han patients with IS (n=457) and matched elderly controls without IS (n=457). Significant differences in BMI, WHR, hypertension, diabetes, smoking, TG, HDL, LDL, LDL, and FBG were observed between cases and controls. The distributions of eNOS VNTR polymorphism were not significantly associated with IS after adjustment for cardiovascular risk factors (OR=1.18, 95% CI: 0.82–1.69). This finding was consistent with the further meta-analysis in Asians. The meta-analysis in Americans demonstrated that 4a/4b+4a/4a genotype was significantly associated with IS risk with an OR of 1.54 (95% CI, 1.09–2.17) compared with the 4b/4b genotype. Our data suggests that BMI, WHR, hypertension, diabetes, smoking, TG, LDL, and FBG may increase the risk of IS. However, eNOS VNTR polymorphism may be not an independent major contributor for IS in Chinese Han population. The VNTR polymorphism might be associated with IS in Americans based on meta-analysis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aelderly 3ahigh density lipoprotein 3aendothelial nitric oxide synthase 3ameta-analysis 3aAmericans 3ahypertension 3aminisatellite repeats 3arisk factors 3alow density lipoprotein 3acapillary electrophoresis 3agenes 3agenotype 3apatients 3aAsians 3adiabetes 3astroke 3abody mass index 3agel electrophoresis 3avasodilation 2aAged 2aAsian Peoplexgenetics. 2aBrain Ischemiaxethnologyxgenetics. 2aDNA Primers 2aElectrophoresis, Capillary 2aFemale 2aHumans 2aIntrons 2aMale 2aMeta-Analysis as Topic 2aMiddle Aged 2aMinisatellite Repeats 2aNitric Oxide Synthase Type IIIxgenetics 0aCI 0aVariable number of tandem repeat 0aFBG 0aeNOS 0arisk 0aOR 0aMeta-analysis 0aVNTR 0aHigh performance capillary electrophoresis 0aIschemic stroke 0aCE 0aEndothelial nitric oxide synthase 0aTC 0aTG 0aIS1 aYin, Xiaoxu1 aWang, Zhihong1 aZhan, Faxian1 aZhang, Yanwei1 aYe, Jianjun1 aHou, Shuangyi1 aGeng, Yijie1 aLi, Yang1 aGuan, Xuhua1 aJiang, Yongzhong1 aZhang, Lingyao1 aDai, Jifang1 aMason, Katherine A.1 aLiu, Jiafa1 aLu, Zuxun1 aCheng, Jinquan0 tGene.g2013 Apr. 01, v. 517 p.218-223dElsevier B.V.x0378-11197nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gene.2012.10.0873Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02412naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002300149245014700172506002800319520131600347592002801663506003701691650001401728650001101742650000801753650001701761650000901778650001101787650002001798650001701818650001601835700002301851773009601874856008301970852000902053655001202062IND60739928920221207054240.0201009s2020    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073992892DNAL7 a10.1051/bioconf/202024000072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKonstantin, Baikov10aTowards on the conservation of rare species Iris glaucescens (Iridaceae) in Novosibirsk oblast: ecoinformative multimodal analysis of the area  aResource is Open Access  aMultimodal ecoinformation analysis as an modern computative approach to geospatial investigation of biodiversity structure is performed on maximum entropy method for local populations of Iris glaucescens -rare species of vascular plants that is included in Red Book of Novosibirsk Oblast.

According to obtained results, trio of the most important variables in the scale of 1/12 arc-degree (5.0 arc-minutes) global model, includes: 1) maximum average diurnal tempreature of surface air in the warmest period of an year (bio5) – 32.7%, annual mean temperature of surface air (bio1) – 11.2%, and maximum average diurnal tempreature of surface air in July (tmax7) – 9.0%. Three of the most important variables in the scale of 1/60 arc-degree (1.0 arc-minutes) regional model (Zone_18) are: maximum average diurnal tempreature of surface air in the warmest period of a year (bio5) -35.7%, maximum average diurnal tempreature of surface air in Juny (tmax6) – 23.1%, minimum average diurnal tempreature of surface air in October (tmin10) – 7,7%. Therefore, climatic variables that influense on the amount of heat in the warmest period of a year, may be taken into account as factors, limiting population size of I. glaucescens.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aIridaceae 3aRussia 3aair 3abiodiversity 3aheat 3amodels 3apopulation size 3arare species 3atemperature1 aVladimir, Doronkin0 tBIO web of conferences.g2020, v. 24 p.00007-dEDP ScienceswJournal:27810x2117-44587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1051/bioconf/202024000073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01715naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002300150245012500173520065900298592002800957650001600985650002101001650001501022650002501037650001501062700002301077700001801100700002101118700002401139700002401163773010801187856008501295852000901380655001201389IND60674086520221120041516.0191231e20191201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067408652DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carres.2019.1078402doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCheng, Janice M.H.13aAn efficient synthesis of a 6″-BODIPY-α-Galactosylceramide probe for monitoring α-Galactosylceramide uptake by cells  aHerein, an efficient synthesis of BODIPY-α-Galactosylceramide 3, which can be used to study the cellular uptake of the potent immunostimulatory parent compound α-Galactosylceramide, is reported.

By comparing it with the pure compounds an anti-inflammatory effect (with mouse ears) is assumed.The topical anti-inflammatory effect of the chloroform extract from Achillea ageratum (Asteraceae)and of stigmasterol and β-sitosterol, isolated of this extract has been evaluated, against to 12-0-tetradecanoylphorbol acetate (TPA)-induced mouse ear edema, using simple (acute model) and multiple applications (chronic model) of the phlogistic agent. Myeloperoxydase activity also was studied in the inflamed ears.In the acute model the extract exerted a dose-dependent effect. All the doses assayed (1, 3 and 5 mg/ear) significantly reduced the edema (50% , 66% and 82 % , respectively). The isolated sterols stigmasterol and β-sitosterol (with doses of 0.5 mg/ear) had similar effect as the extract with doses of 1 and 3 mg (59% and 65% respectively).In the chronic model the anti-inflammatory effect generally was a more moderate one. The highest dose of the extract decreased the edema reduction to 26% with the highest dose of the extract applied. With the compounds the effect decreased to 36% with stigmasterol, and 40.6% with β-sitosterol.Myeloperoxydase activity (MPO) was reduced by the extract and the compounds in the acute model, however, in the chronic edema, the enzyme inhibition was very weak with all treatments even with the standard substance.These results indicate that the chloroform extract of Achillea ageratum and some of the its components stigmasterol and β-sitosterol are more effective as topical anti-inflammatory agents in acute than in the chronic process and their action is markedly influenced by the inhibition of neutrophil migration into inflamed tissue.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAchillea ageratum 3aacetates 3aanti-inflammatory activity 3aanti-inflammatory agents 3abeta-sitosterol 3achloroform 3adose response 3aears 3aedema 3aenzyme inhibition 3ainflammation 3amice 3amodels 3aneutrophils 3astigmasterol 0aAchillea ageratum 0aSterols 0aTopical Anti-Inflammatory 0aChronic Inflammation and Acute Inflammation1 aSáenz, M.

Commercial column separation methods for HbA1c measurement were lacking throughput and sometimes interfered with hemoglobin variants. In this work, we developed a high-throughput and specific method for HbA1c by quantitative measurement of N-terminal peptides (NT method). Two thousand specimens could be measured in 8 h. The high-throughput was achieved by using a fast analysis of matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) and an efficient proteolysis accelerated by laser irradiation. An intensity ratio of glycosylated to non-glycosylated hemoglobin N-terminal peptides was used to calculate the HbA1c level in blood. Interference from Hb variants of N-terminal peptides could be excluded by a highly accurate mass selection. The coefficient of variation (CV) of intra-assay precision was 9.8 and 9.9 %, respectively. The CVs of inter-assay precision over 20 days were 9.1 and 8.4 %, respectively. Measurement results were well correlated with the commercially available column method (r = 0.995). The NT method is promising for large-scale screening for diabetes mellitus among people.  aPublisher supplied data 3ablood 3adesorption 3adiabetes mellitus 3aglycohemoglobin 3aglycosylation 3ahemoglobin 3aionization 3airradiation 3amatrix-assisted laser desorption-ionization mass spectrometry 3apeople 3apeptides 3aproteolysis 3aquantitative analysis 3ascreening1 aZang, Wenjuan1 aZhang, Xiangmin0 tAnalytical and bioanalytical chemistry.g2016 Feb., v. 408, no. 5 p.1507-1513dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx1618-26427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00216-015-9258-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02731naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100001900137245006800156300001600224520149600240592002801736650002101764650001201785650001201797650001701809650002801826650001401854650001901868650001101887650002001898650001701918650001201935650002101947650002501968650001701993650001002010650001502020650002402035650002302059651001302082773011002095856007102205852000902276655001202285IND60518260020221122151159.0160411e196902  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051826002DNAL7 a10.2307/19423532doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOld, Sylvia M.10aMicroclimate, Fire, and Plant Production in an Illinois Prairie  ap. 355-384.  aDecomposition and effects of fire on microclimate and plant production of a Tall Grass Prairie were studied in east—central Illinois. After two years simulated litter samples in contact with soil lost 64% of their initial weight. Burning caused a 2—3 fold increase in production and a ten fold increase in flowering. Application of mulch, lowered flowering rate; response was proportional to thickness of mulch and length of time it was in place, Artificial shading of burned areas under green—house frames lowered flowering rate. Burning or clear cutting vegetation increased percent N and P in May foliage. A May application of N fertilizer increased flowering and dry matter production. Nutrient release from ash had no effect on flowering or production. Root production was similar on burned and Burn 3 areas; a turnover rate of 0.45 was calculated. Calcium content of roots in May increased after fire and N content decreased. Temperature from —5 to +50 cm and light intensity from 0 to +50 cm were higher on burned than Burn 3 areas. Maximum soil surface temperatures occurred three months earlier on Burn 0 than Burn 3 areas. Soil moisture was never severely limiting to plant growth. Growing season microclimate measurements at 50 and 200 cm were combined into a microclimatic index, which allowed comparison of the microenvironment of three burning regimes. Total flowering was proportional to duration and degree of favourable microclimatic conditions from May to mid July.  aPublisher supplied data 3aartificial shade 3aburning 3acalcium 3aclearcutting 3adry matter accumulation 3aflowering 3agrowing season 3aleaves 3alight intensity 3amicroclimate 3amulches 3anitrogen content 3anitrogen fertilizers 3aplant growth 3aroots 3asoil water 3asurface temperature 3atallgrass prairies 3aIllinois0 tEcological monographs.g1969 Feb., v. 39, no. 4 p.355-384dEcological Society of Americax0012-96157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2307/19423533Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02008naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100001600112245012100128300001600249506002800265520108200293592002801375506003701403650001001440650002101450650001101471653001401482653000901496653001601505653002001521700001501541773012901556852000901685655001201694IND60739929120221207054246.0210420e201811  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073992912DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMasjedi, A.13aAn Iinvestigation into the Effect of Slot in Spur Dike on the Development of Scouring Around it in a 180-Degree Bend  ap. 357-371.  aResource is Open Access  aIn this study, the performance of slot in the spur dike was evaluated as a way to reduce the scouring around the installed flat spur dike in a 180 degree bend and the development of scouring in the slotted spur dike was compared with that of the spur dike with no slot. To evaluate the effect of the slot on the development of scouring around it, a flat spur dike made of Plax Glass was installed in a position of 70 degrees from a bend (180 degrees) in the flume bed. After determining the maximum of scouring depth at the tip, to reduce the scouring around the spur dike, two slots with the determined height were placed in 4 different positions in the spur dike. Experiments with 4 different discharges and constant flow depth in clear water conditions were conducted. The results of the experiments showed that the created the slot reduced the scouring depth toward the spur dike. In both slots, the minimum of scouring depth was seen in a model with the closest position of the slot toward tip, and its maximum was seen in a model with the farthest position from the slot.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aglass 3ahydraulic flumes 3amodels 0aspur dike 0aslot 0ascour depth 0a180 degree bend1 aJafari, B.0 t̒Ulūm-i āb va khāk.g2018 Nov., v. 22, no. 3 p.357-371dIsfahan University of TechnologywJournal:27871x2476-55547nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle03323naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100006100147245011600208300001800324520181600342536012002158592002802278650001902306650001402325650000902339650002702348650001502375650001302390650001302403650001502416650001202431650002002443653001302463653002202476653001202498653002002510700002202530700001702552700002202569700005902591773013602650856008202786852000902868655001202877IND60794541020221122035012.0220925e202210  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079454102DNAL7 a10.1177/1098612X2110468472doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTanaka, Toshiyuki1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7911-913X10aPreliminary study of CT features of intermediate- and high-grade alimentary lymphoma and adenocarcinoma in cats  ap. 1065-1071.  aThe ultrasonographic findings of many feline intestinal tumours are similar. This study evaluated the CT features of intermediate- and high-grade alimentary lymphoma and adenocarcinoma in cats. CT was performed on six cats with adenocarcinoma and 14 cats with lymphoma. Comparisons between tumour types were conducted, focusing on CT features, including obstruction (present or absent), growth patterns of lesions (symmetry or asymmetry), layering enhancement (present or absent), location of the lesion, number of lesions (solitary or multiple), lymphadenopathy (present or absent), location of lymphadenopathy, pulmonary metastasis (present or absent) and maximum thickness (mm) of the lesion. The cats with adenocarcinoma (n = 5/6 [83%]) experienced intestinal obstruction significantly more often than cats with lymphoma (n = 0/14 [0%]; P = 0.0004). Layering enhancement was observed significantly more often in cats with adenocarcinoma (n = 6/6 [100%]) than in cats with lymphoma (n = 1/14 [7%]; P = 0.0002). Lymphadenopathy was detected significantly more often in cats with lymphoma (n = 14/14 [100%]) than in cats with adenocarcinoma (n = 2/6 [33%]) (P = 0.003). In cats with lymphoma, the intestine (12.1 ± 3.9 mm) was significantly thicker than that in cats with adenocarcinoma (6.4 ± 2.3 mm; P = 0.005). To the best of our knowledge, no reports have described the characteristics of feline intestinal tumours using CT. Layering enhancement was observed in cats with intestinal adenocarcinomas. No layering enhancement was observed in alimentary lymphoma in cats, but enlarged regional nodes were noted. Lesions with lymphoma were thicker than those with adenocarcinoma. These findings may help differentiate between adenocarcinomas and lymphomas.  aFunding The authors received no financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadenocarcinoma 3aasymmetry 3acats 3aintestinal obstruction 3aintestines 3alymphoma 3amedicine 3ametastasis 3asurgery 3aultrasonography 0aDuodenum 0aintestinal tumour 0ajejunum 0alymphadenopathy1 aNoguchi, Shunsuke1 aWada, Yusuke1 aNishida, Hidetaka1 aAkiyoshi, Hideo1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5945-03000 tJournal of feline medicine and surgery.g2022 Oct., v. 24, no. 10 p.1065-1071dSAGE PublicationswJournal:jnl58542x1532-27507nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1098612X2110468473Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02680naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100002400137245010600161300001600267520176200283592002802045650001502073650000902088650001102097650001402108650001202122650001402134650001702148650001102165773011002176856007102286852000902357655001202366IND60518260120221122151249.0160411e196902  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051826012DNAL7 a10.2307/19423522doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMurdoch, William W.10aSwitching in General Predators: Experiments on Predator Specificity and Stability of Prey Populations  ap. 335-354.  a"Switching" in predators which attack several prey species potentially can stabilize the numbers in prey populations. In switching, the number of attacks upon a species is disproportionately large when the species is abundant relative to other prey, and disproportionately small when the species is relatively rare. The null case for two prey species can be written: P₁/P₂ = cN₁/N₂, where P₁/P₂ is the ratio of the two prey expected in the diet, N₁/N₂ is the ratio given and c is a proportionality constant. Predators were sea—shore snails and prey were mussels and barnacles. Experiments in the laboratory modelled aspects of various natural situations. When the predator had a strong preference (c) between prey the data and the "null case" model were in good agreement. Preference could not altered by subjecting predators to training regimens. When preference was weak the data did not fit the model replicates were variable. Predators could be trained easily to one or other prey species. From a number of experiments it was concluded that in the weak—preference case no switch would occur in nature except where there is an opportunity for predators to become trained to the abundant species. A patchy distribution of the abundant prey could provide this opportunity. Given one prey species, snails caused a decreasing percentage mortality as prey numbers increased. This occurred also with 2 prey species present when preference was strong. When preference was weak the form of the response was unclear. When switching occurred the percentage prey mortality increased with prey density, giving potentially stabilizing mortality. The consequences of these conclusions for prey population regulation and for diversity are discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCirripedia 3adiet 3amodels 3amortality 3amussels 3apredators 3aprey species 3asnails0 tEcological monographs.g1969 Feb., v. 39, no. 4 p.335-354dEcological Society of Americax0012-96157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2307/19423523Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03214naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004600094040001800140100002000158245010800178300001600286506002800302520188900330592002802219506003702247650003302284650001202317650000902329650001502338650000902353650002102362650001202383650001702395653003802412653001602450653002202466653002402488653001702512773018502529856009302714852000902807655001202816IND60739929220221207054229.0201214e202010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073992922DNAL7 a10.30766/2072-9081.2020.21.5.503-5112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKuryleva, A.

The soil of the state variety testing sites: soddy-telopodzol sandy loamy - Uvinsky state varietal test site; light-gray forest heavy loamy - Sarapulsky state varietal test site; sod-mid-podzolic medium loamy - Mozhginsky state varietal test site. The agrometeorological conditions of the growing seasons differed in terms of heat and moisture supply: 2016 - hot and dry (hydrothermic coefficient – 0.70), 2017 - excessively humid (hydrothermic coefficient – 2.14), 2018 - wet (hydrothermic coefficient – 1.21). A high yield of winter wheat varieties was revealed in the southern zone of the Udmurt Republic (Sarapulskiy GSU - 3.32 t/ha and Mozhginskiy GSU - 2.95 t/ha). Weather conditions of the year mostly influenced the formation of winter wheat yield - 64.8-98.5 %. The share of participation of the variety is 0.8-31.7 %. A relatively high (3.40-3.47 t/ha) "genetic flexibility" of varieties Darina, Mera and Kazanskaya 285 was revealed, 7-9 % higher than the Volzhskaya K standard. The highest level of environmental sustainability was established in the varieties Volzhskaya K and Mera ‒ d = 67.36-67.44 %. According to the indicators of plasticity, a strong response to changes in environmental conditions was revealed in Darina, Mera, Universiada varieties (bi = 1.05-1.09); weak reaction – in Biryuza and Ilot varieties (bi = 0.91-0.92); plastic varieties - Volzhskaya K, Bashkirskaya 10, Italmas, Kazanskaya 285 and Moskovskaya 39 (bi = 0.96-1.01). The smallest gap between the maximum and the minimum yield (stress resistance) was noted for the Ilot variety ‒ 2.91 t/ha.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aenvironmental sustainability 3aforests 3aheat 3aplasticity 3asoil 3astress tolerance 3aweather 3awinter wheat 0aindex of environmental conditions 0ayield range 0astress resistance 0agenetic flexibility 0afactor share0 tAgrarnaâ nauka Evro-Severo-Vostoka.g2020 Oct., v. 21, no. 5 p.503-511dFederal Agricultural Research Center of the North-East named N.V.

However, the current low-efficiency manipulation of Gr has hindered the arraying and practical use of such detectors. We invented a multistep method of accurately tailoring graphene into interdigital electrodes for fabricating a sensitive, stable deep-ultraviolet photodetector based on Zn-doped Ga₂O₃ films. The fabricated photodetector exhibits a series of excellent performance, including extremely low dark current (∼10–¹¹ A), an ultrahigh photo-to-dark ratio (>10⁵), satisfactory responsivity (1.05 A/W), and excellent selectivity for the deep-ultraviolet band, compared to those with ordinary metal electrodes. The raise of photocurrent and responsivity is attributed to the increase of incident photons through Gr and separated carriers caused by the built-in electric field formed at the interface of Gr and Ga₂O₃:Zn films. The proposed ideas and methods of tailoring Gr can not only improve the performance of devices but more importantly contribute to the practical development of graphene.  aPublisher supplied data 3adetectors 3aelectric current 3aelectric field 3aelectrodes 3agraphene 3amaterials science 3aphotons 3atransmittance 3azinc 0agraphene interdigital electrodes 0aphotodetector 0adeep-ultraviolet 0agallium oxide 0aultralow dark current1 aZhang, Dan1 aLin, Richeng1 aZhang, Zhaojun1 aZheng, Wei1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4329-04691 aHuang, Feng1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4623-22160 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2018 Dec. 06, v. 11, no. 1 p.1013-1020dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.8b143803Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02477naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001700152245010200169300001600271520154100287592002801828650001401856650002201870650001301892653002601905653001901931653001901950700001301969773009701982856008702079852000902166655001202175IND60630972520221119024003.0190328e20190501xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063097252DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apenergy.2019.01.2572doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCallanan, J.10aOptimal thermoacoustic energy extraction via temporal phase control and traveling wave generation  ap. 599-612.  aThis work presents a novel class of thermoacoustic devices that comprises a simple resonator geometry and a control transducer to excite hybrid standing-traveling waves, thereby increasing the amount of extractable acoustic power in thermoacoustic energy converters. The onset gas oscillations in compact thermoacoustic resonators are predominantly standing waves, which exhibit a pressure-velocity time-phasing that is detrimental to the acoustic power output of conventional thermoacoustic systems. By employing open and closed-loop feedback control in a thermoacoustic energy converter with dual sensing and actuating piezoelectric transducers located at both ends of the resonator cavity, it is shown that the traveling wave portion of the resultant wave dynamics can be significantly increased at a relatively small cost of power pumped into the system. As a result, the controlled thermoacoustic system outperforms a conventional one of the same size and configuration by virtue of the increased acoustic power output. The new design also drastically improves the power density due to the lack of additional structural components typically needed to sustain traveling waves. Stability criteria are investigated, along with a standing wave ratio ellipsoidal fit analysis that gives both qualitative and quantitative measures of the energy converter’s behavior. The proposed thermoacoustic energy conversion mechanism presents a new methodology for increasing the energy generation capabilities of this class of energy harvesters.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacoustics 3aenergy conversion 3ageometry 0aThermoacoustic energy 0aStanding waves 0aActive control1 aNouh, M.0 tApplied energy.g2019 May 01, v. 241 p.599-612dElsevier LtdwJournal:11876x0306-26197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2019.01.2573Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02599naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001700153245007900170520112700249592002801376650002101404650002901425650001701454650001401471650001501485650002301500650001301523650002301536650001801559650001501577650001101592650001201603650002301615650001601638650002501654651002901679653001801708653001101726653002301737653002101760653001101781653003101792700001801823700001801841700001801859773011901877856008801996852000902084655001202093IND60662846820221123033506.0211114e20191220xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066284682DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.1341922doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBerglund, E.10aMicroplastics in a freshwater mussel (Anodonta anatina) in Northern Europe  aAlarming amounts of microplastics have recently been shown to accumulate in the environment. Recent focus has been on synthetic material contaminating the marine environment, while effects on freshwater habitats and organisms have received less attention. We here confirm and analyse occurrence of microplastics in the duck mussel, Anodonta anatina, in a Swedish river. All analysed mussels contained microplastics, and the number of microplastic debris found in the mussels increased with mussel size. In addition, we demonstrate higher concentrations of microplastics downstream urban areas with wastewater treatment plants compared to a rural upstream location. Both fibres and particles were found in the mussels, indicating that the emissions of these pollutants may have varying origin. Our study indicates that microplastics can be suspended in the water column in streams and that concentrations are higher downstream anthropogenic activity. We discuss our results in light of potential pathways in rural versus surrounding arable land, and highlight a number of required research directions in the aquatic system.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAnodonta anatina 3aanthropogenic activities 3aarable soils 3aemissions 3afreshwater 3afreshwater mussels 3ahabitats 3amarine environment 3amicroplastics 3apollutants 3arivers 3astreams 3asynthetic products 3aurban areas 3awastewater treatment 3aNorthern European region 0aMicroplastics 0aMussel 0aFreshwater systems 0aAnodonta anatina 0aRivers 0aWastewater treatment plant1 aFogelberg, V.1 aNilsson, P.A.1 aHollander, J.0 tScience of the total environment.g2019 Dec. 20, v. 697 p.134192-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.1341923Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02301naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001500153245008800168300001400256506002800270520073600298592002801034506003701062650001101099650001101110650001501121650001101136650001401147650001001161653001701171653002301188653001901211653001901230653002101249653005201270653001101322653002001333653002501353653001501378653001401393700002001407700001901427700002001446700002801466700002001494773018401514856008801698852000901786655001201795IND60739929620221215142835.0200116e201806  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073992962DNAL7 a10.30901/2227-8834-2016-4-18-272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aF.Yndgaard12aA low-cost method for the detection of duplicate holdings among genebank accessions  ap. 18-27.  aResource is Open Access  aA set of 185 pairs of accessions with the same name from the Russian and Nordic collections of barley were grown in the field in Pushkin and were scored by the same person using a set of morphological descriptors.

Flexibility from hydro and storage complements the high temporal variability of wind and solar, and transmission infrastructure helps the power balancing by moving electricity in the spatial dimension. We study cost-optimal highly-renewable Chinese power systems under ambitious CO2 emission reduction targets, by deploying a 31-node hourly-resolved techno-economic optimization model supported by a validated weather-converted 38-year-long renewable power generation and electricity demand dataset. With a new realistic reservoir hydro model, we find that if CO2 emission reduction goes beyond 70%, storage facilities such as hydro, battery and hydrogen become necessary for a moderate system cost. Numerical results show that these flexibility components can lower renewable curtailment by two thirds, allow higher solar PV share by a factor of two and contribute to covering summer cooling demand. We show that expanding unidirectional high-voltage DC lines on top of the regional inter-connections is technically sufficient and more economical than ultra-high-voltage-AC-connected “One-Net” grid. Finally, constraining transmission volume from the optimum by up to 25% does not push total costs much higher, while the significant need for battery storage remains even with abundant interconnectivity.  aPublisher supplied data 3abatteries 3acarbon dioxide 3adata collection 3aelectricity 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3ahydrogen 3ainfrastructure 3amodels 3apower generation 3asolar energy 3asummer 3atemporal variation 3awater power 3awind 3awind power 0aChina 0aDecarbonization 0aLarge-scale integration of renewables 0aHydro power 0aWind power 0aStorage1 aBrown, Tom1 aAndresen, Gorm Bruun1 aSchlachtberger, David P.1 aGreiner, Martin0 tApplied energy.g2019 Apr. 01, v. 239 p.1308-1321dElsevier LtdwJournal:11876x0306-26197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2019.02.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02263naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002200143245013900165300001600304520076400320592002801084650001901112650001201131650002201143650001401165650001001179650001801189650001301207650000901220650001201229650002401241650001301265650002001278650002001298650001401318650002201332653002601354653001301380653003701393700001701430700002101447700002101468700002301489700002001512773015101532856007701683852000901760655001201769IND60522963220221118013355.0160605e20140602xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052296322DNAL7 a10.1515/znc-1999-11182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSalgueiro, Sancha12aA Protein from the Salivary Glands of the Giant Amazon Leech with High Sequence Homology to a Nicotinic Acetylcholine Receptor Subunit  ap. 963-971.  aA gene coding for a soluble protein with homology to the β subunit of the nicotinic acetyl­choline receptor from goldfish was isolated from a cDNA library of Haementeria ghilianii salivary glands.

Five genotypes of PCV2 were recently identified: PCV2a, PCV2b, PCV2c, PCV2d and PCV2e. In addition, a novel porcine circovirus from a case of a sow with dermatitis, nephropathy syndrome and reproductive failure has been identified based on metagenomic analysis and classified as porcine circovirus type 3 (PCV3). Therefore, the current study was conducted to determine the prevalence and genetic characteristics of PCV2 and PCV3 in clinical samples. RESULTS: A total of 471 samples (161 tissue samples of lungs and lymph nodes from 34 farms and 310 serum samples from 47 farms) were tested for PCV2. Among them, 171 samples from 59 farms that had been positive for PCV2 were genotyped. Another 690 samples (296 tissue samples of lungs and lymph nodes from 91 farms, 108 samples of aborted foetuses from 26 farms, and 286 serum samples from 47 farms) were tested for PCV3. Based on PCV2 genotyping results, PCV2d was the most prevalent genotype (107 of 171 samples), and co-infections with combinations of PCV2a, 2b and 2d were identified in 48 samples from 17 farms. A total of 14 samples from 11 farms were also positive for both PCV2 and PCV3. For PCV3, 57 samples (9.8%) from 32 farms (23.2%) were positive. Among the 108 aborted foetuses from 26 farms, only 2 samples were positive for PCV3. Based on sequence comparisons, PCV2d shares 89.6–91.0% and 93.2–94.3% homology with PCV2a and PCV2b, respectively; 98.6–100% homology is shared among PCV2d strains. The PCV3 strains identified in this study share 98.0–99.5% homology. CONCLUSIONS: Our study concludes that PCV2d has become the most predominant genotype in Korea. PCV3 was also identified in clinical samples, though no significant association with clinical symptoms was observed in PCV3-positive cases.  aPublisher supplied data  a315029-3cTechnology Development Program for Bio-industry  aPJ012612cCooperative Research Program for Agriculture Science & Technology Development0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aPorcine circovirus 3aPorcine circovirus-2 3aPorcine circovirus-3 3ablood serum 3adermatitis 3afarms 3afetus 3agenotype 3agenotyping 3akidney diseases 3alungs 3alymph nodes 3ametagenomics 3amixed infection 3asequence analysis 3asigns and symptoms (animals and humans) 3asows 3aveterinary medicine 3aKorean Peninsula1 aNazki, Salik1 aKwon, Sam1 aJuhng, Jhung-Hyun1 aMun, Kyeong-Hwan1 aJeon, Do-Young1 aJeong, Chang-Gi1 aKhatun, Amina1 aKang, Seog-Jin1 aKim, Wŏn-il,1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0465-07940 tBMC veterinary research.g2018 Dec., v. 14, no. 1 p.294-294dBioMed CentralwJournal:jnl4152735x1746-61487nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12917-018-1614-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03072naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003600113040001800149100001300167245011800180300001600298520149500314592002801809650001501837650001301852650000901865650001001874650001401884650001301898650001201911650005401923650002301977650002602000650001402026651001002040651001002050653000802060653000702068653000702075653001102082653001502093653002002108653002902128653002502157700001602182700002402198700001402222700001402236700001902250700002102269700002302290700001602313773007402329856008202403852000902485655001202494IND60099041120221116202643.0161021e20130401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009904112DNAL7 a233286452pmid7 a10.1016/j.gene.2012.12.0962doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Yali10aHigh altitude adaptation of the schizothoracine fishes (Cyprinidae) revealed by the mitochondrial genome analyses  ap. 169-178.  aThe schizothoracine fishes, also known as “mountain carps” are widely distributed in the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau and its peripheral regions. Although they provide a prime example of high altitude adaptation, the phylogenetic relationships and the divergence times among these carp lineages are still controversial. Moreover, the genetic basis for high altitude adaptation is also poorly understood. In this study, we determined the mitochondrial genomes from two species of the schizothoracine fishes, representing a “morphologically primitive” clade and “morphologically specialized” clade, respectively. The phylogenetic tree and the divergence times were estimated within the evolutionary framework of the entire order Cypriniformes. Our results indicate a polyphylyetic relationship of the schizothoracine fishes and suggest two independent migration events into the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau: one by the “morphologically primitive” clade in the Late Miocene and another by the “morphologically specialized” clade in the Eocene. Rapid speciation events of each clade from the Late Miocene to the Pliocene correspond to the timing of the geologic acceleration of the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau. Interestingly, we found evidence for positive selection acting on the protein coding genes in the mitochondrial genomes of the “morphologically specialized” clade, implying a possible genetic basis for high altitude adaptation in this derived lineage of cypriniform fishes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCyprinidae 3aaltitude 3acarp 3agenes 3aphylogeny 2aAltitude 2aAnimals 2aCyprinidaexclassificationxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aGenetic Speciation 2aGenome, Mitochondrial 2aPhylogeny 3aChina 0aChina 0aGTR 0aML 0amt 0aOXPHOS 0aω (dN/dS) 0aschizothoracine 0aHigh altitude adaptation 0amitochondrial genome1 aRen, Zhumei1 aShedlock, Andrew M.1 aWu, Jiaqi1 aSang, Luo1 aTersing, Tashi1 aHasegawa, Masami1 aYonezawa, Takahiro1 aZhong, Yang0 tGene.g2013 Apr. 01, v. 517 p.169-178dElsevier B.V.x0378-11197nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gene.2012.12.0963Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03632naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100002400137245007800161300001600239520261100255592002802866650001202894650001202906650002202918650001202940650001802952650001402970650001502984650001602999650001703015650002303032650001003055651001503065773011003080856007103190852000903261655001203270IND60518260620221122151231.0160411e197002  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051826062DNAL7 a10.2307/19422942doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSutherland, John P.10aDynamics of High and Low Populations of the Limpet, Acmaea scabra (Gould)  ap. 169-188.  aThe dynamics of naturally occurring high (zone 1) and low (zone 2) populations of the limpet, Acmaea scabra, were investigated on Bodega Head in Sonoma County, California. Populations at different intertidal heights can be considered separate because migration between levels is precluded by the homing behavior of A. scabra. Each population was investigated by means of 400—cm² quadrats containing marked individuals; the quadrats were censused approximately every 2 months and yielded information on density, size distribution, dispersion, recruitment, growth, and mortality. Samples were collected from each population approximately every 2 weeks to determine the seasonal pattern of reproduction and changes in size—specific weights. In zone 1 the probable pattern of food availability was distinctly seasonal because of the interaction of tides and climate. Growth and reproduction in this zone were also seasonal, probably increasing and decreasing with the food supply. Seasonal changes in size—specific weights were correlated with the reproductive cycle. Dispersion in zone 1 was always contagious. Recruitment was lower in zone 1, resulting in lower densities and a lower rate of mortality. Annual growth was greater in zone 1 because of the lower densities; consequently limpets in zone 1 were larger and biomass was greater than in zone 2. The population in zone 1 was susceptible to density—independent (catastrophic) mortality and corresponds to a population on the "edge" of the species' range. In zone 2 food was probably more constantly available because this zone was submerged more regularly and to a greater extent than zone 1. As a result there were more constant rates of growth and reproduction, and since reproduction was less variable, there were no seasonal changes in size—specific weights. Dispersion in zone 2 was random or, occasionally, uniform. Recruitment was higher in zone 2 resulting in higher densities and a higher mortality rate. Annual growth was lower because of the higher densities; consequently limpets in zone 2 were smaller and biomass was lower than in zone 1. The population in zone 2 was less susceptible to density—independent (catastrophic) mortality and corresponds to a population in the "center" of the species' range. Zone 2 is the "center" of the species' range, yet individual performance was poor because of the high densities; the probability of dying was high, growth rates were low, and the animals remained small. In both zones competition for food limited biomass, but lack of food did not cause mortality, i.e., regulate density.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiomass 3aclimate 3afood availability 3alimpets 3alittoral zone 3amortality 3aphilopatry 3aprobability 3areproduction 3aseasonal variation 3atides 3aCalifornia0 tEcological monographs.g1970 Feb., v. 40, no. 2 p.169-188dEcological Society of Americax0012-96157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2307/19422943Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01564naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002000149245012500169300001600294520058200310592002800892650001400920650002300934650001200957650001300969650001200982700001400994700002301008700002201031773010301053856008501156852000901241655001201250IND60579236120221118043434.0170816e20160219xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057923612DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.orglett.6b000072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMizukami, Akiho10aRhodium-Catalyzed Cyclization of 2-Ethynylanilines in the Presence of Isocyanates: Approach toward Indole-3-carboxamides  ap. 748-751.  aCatalytic synthesis of indole-3-carboxamides from 2-ethynylanilines and isocyanates was achieved in the presence of a rhodium catalyst through a tandem-type, cyclization–addition sequence. This tandem-type process can be performed under mild reaction conditions, affording 2,3-disubstituted indoles in a one-pot manner generally in good to excellent yields.

Structured surveys were administered to 1,331 homeless women in Los Angeles who were either daily drug and alcohol users for the past 6 months or nondaily substance users. Physical abuse and parental drug abuse predicted daily drug use in the whole sample and selected subgroups, whereas parental alcohol abuse predicted daily alcohol use in the whole sample. Teen self-esteem was also found to have a protective effect on daily alcohol use for the sample and for African American women. Negative peer influence in adolescence predicted daily drug use among high-acculturated Latinas. In summary, childhood abuse, parental substance use, and negative peer influence affect important roles in homeless women's daily substance use.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAfrican Americans 3aacculturation 3aadolescence 3aadults 3aalcohol abuse 3achildhood 3adrug abuse 3adrugs 3aprotective effect 3aself-esteem 3asurveys 3awomen1 aLongshore, Douglas,1 aKEENAN, COLLEEN1 aLESSER, JANNA1 aLEAKE, BARBARA D.0 tAmerican behavioral scientist.g2001 Sept., v. 45, no. 1 p.35-50dSAGE PublicationswJournal:2328x0002-76427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/000276401219570063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02396naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001300144245013400157300002000291520095400311592002801265650001301293650001701306650001601323650001701339650001301356650001101369650002601380650001501406650001901421650002201440650001501462650002301477653002001500653003301520653001001553653002501563653002301588700001501611700002401626700001401650700001701664700001901681773012501700856008001825852000901905655001201914IND60569471820221121234915.0170531e20170531xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056947182DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.7b021262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJin, Lin10aFabrication and Characterization of Three-Dimensional (3D) Core–Shell Structure Nanofibers Designed for 3D Dynamic Cell Culture  ap. 17718-17726.  aThree-dimensional elastic nanofibers (3D eNFs) can offer a suitable 3D dynamic microenvironment and sufficient flexibility to regulate cellular behavior and functional protein expression. In this study, we report a novel approach to prepare 3D nanofibers with excellent mechanical properties by solution-assisted electrospinning technology and in situ polymerization. The obtained 3D eNFs demonstrated excellent biocompatible properties to meet cell culture requirements under a dynamic environment in vitro. Moreover, these 3D eNFs also promoted human bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) adhesion and collagen expression under biomechanical stimulation. The results demonstrated that this dynamic cell culture system could positively impact cellular collagen but has no significant effect on the proliferation of hMSCs grown in the 3D eNFs. This work may give rise to a new approach for constructing a 3D cell culture for tissue engineering.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadhesion 3abiomechanics 3abone marrow 3acell culture 3acollagen 3ahumans 3amechanical properties 3ananofibers 3apolymerization 3aprotein synthesis 3astem cells 3atissue engineering 0aelectrospinning 0athree-dimensional nanofibers 0ahMSCs 0adynamic cell culture 0atissue engineering1 aXu, Qinwei1 aKuddannaya, Shreyas1 aLi, Cheng1 aZhang, Yilei1 aWang, Zhenling0 tACS Applied Materials & Interfaces.g2017 May 31, v. 9, no. 21 p.17718-17726dAmerican Chemical Societyx1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facsami.7b021263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02012naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245009500170300001600265520106100281592002801342650001101370650001601381650001201397700001801409700002301427700001801450700006101468773008701529856008501616852000901701655001201710IND60674087520221120034413.0191231e202002  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067408752DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbon.2019.10.0362doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHays, Samuel S.10aEnvisioned role of slit bypass pores in physical aging of carbon molecular sieve membranes  ap. 385-394.  aCarbon molecular sieve (CMS) hollow fibers are a special class of rigid, molecular sieving membranes with unique scalability and excellent separation properties for challenging gas-pairs. These high-performing membranes are subject to moderate productivity losses and selectivity gains over time via a phenomenon typically referred to as physical aging. This article considers the role of slit bypass pores in physical aging as sensed by membrane property changes of CMS derived from aromatic polyimide precursors. Such pores are believed to be edge imperfections between adjacent ultramicroporous plates that may tighten over time, causing a reduction in penetrant diffusion coefficients. The envisioned mechanism leading to such slit bypass pores and their effects on penetrant transport are considered here from a fundamental perspective. Importantly, these slit bypass pores can be manipulated to suppress physical aging in CMS hollow fiber membranes, therefore enabling attractive long-term separation properties for multiple challenging applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon 3adiffusivity 3asieving1 aSanyal, Oishi1 aLeón, Nicholas E.1 aArab, Pezhman1 aKoros, William J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5873-08990 tCarbon.g2020 Feb., v. 157 p.385-394dElsevier LtdwJournal:11670x0008-62237nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbon.2019.10.0363Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01566naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002500143245011500168300001600283520043700299592002800736650002800764650002000792650002000812650001400832653002000846653003100866653002200897653002100919700002700940700002400967773015100991856007701142852000901219655001201228IND60522963620221118013225.0160605e20140602xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052296362DNAL7 a10.1515/znc-1999-11222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBabincová, Melánia10aNotes: Activation of Hematoporphyrin in Alternating Magnetic Field: Possible Implications for Cancer Treatment  ap. 993-995.  aA new mechanism of cell damage by alternating mag­netic field with hematoporphyrin is described.

Cervico-vaginal mucus (CVM) is an easy to collect potentially informative source of biomarkers for the diagnosis and prognosis of uterine disease in cows. Here, we report an improved method for processing CVM from postpartum dairy cows for the measurement of immune biomarkers. CVM samples were collected from the vagina using gloved hand during the first two weeks postpartum and processed with buffer alone or buffer containing different concentrations of the reducing agents recommended in standard protocols: Dithiothriotol (DTT) or N-Acetyl-L-Cysteine (NAC). Total protein was measured using the bicinchoninic acid (BCA) assay; interleukin 6 (IL-6), IL-8 and α1-acid glycoprotein (AGP) were measured by ELISA. RESULTS: We found that use of reducing agents to liquefy CVM affects protein yield and the accuracy of biomarker detection. Our improved protocol results in lower protein yields but improved detection of cytokines and chemokines. Using our modified method to measure AGP in CVM we found raised levels of AGP at seven days postpartum in CVM from cows that went on to develop endometritis. CONCLUSION: We conclude that processing CVM without reducing agents improves detection of biomarkers that reflect uterine health in cattle. We propose that measurement of AGP in CVM during the first week postpartum may identify cows at risk of developing clinical endometritis.  aPublisher supplied data  a13/S/472cDepartment of Agriculture, Food and the Marine  aPOR/2012/37cHealth Research Board0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aacetylcysteine 3abiomarkers 3adairy cows 3adiagnostic techniques 3aearly diagnosis 3aendometritis 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3aglycoproteins 3ainterleukin-6 3ainterleukin-8 3amucus 3aprognosis 3aprotein content 3aprotocols 3areducing agents 3arisk 3avagina 3aveterinary medicine1 aKelly, Paul1 aChapwanya, Aspinas1 aMeade, Kieran G.1 aO’Farrelly, Cliona0 tBMC veterinary research.g2018 Dec., v. 14, no. 1 p.297-297dBioMed CentralwJournal:jnl4152735x1746-61487nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12917-018-1619-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03321naa a2200697 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003600113040001800149100001700167245008900184300001600273520145100289592002801740650001501768650001201783650001901795650001501814650002101829650001901850650002201869650001301891650002201904650000901926650001001935650000901945650004301954650001101997650001102008650001602019650003602035650003602071650003402107651001802141653001002159653001002169653001602179653001002195653000702205653000702212653000902219653000802228653001802236653001002254653001802264653001802282700001602300700001502316700001902331700002002350700001702370700001802387700002102405700002002426773007402446856008202520852000902602655001202611IND60099041320221116202623.0161021e20130401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009904132DNAL7 a232960582pmid7 a10.1016/j.gene.2012.12.0882doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJo, Yong Hwa10aMCPH1 protein expression and polymorphisms are associated with risk of breast cancer  ap. 184-190.  aMicrocephalin 1 (MCPH1) has a crucial role in the DNA damage response by promoting the expression of checkpoint kinase 1 (CHK1) and breast cancer susceptibility gene 1 (BRCA1). MCPH1 containing BRCT domain has been suggested as a tumor suppressor in breast and ovarian cancers. We analyzed the effect of both protein expression and MCPH1 polymorphisms in breast cancer patients. Low nuclear expression of microcephalin was present in 52.4% of breast cancers and was associated with allele T in rs2912010 (p=0.046). However, cytoplasmic microcephalin expression increased with increasing grade (p=0.010). An association between low nucleus microcephalin expression and allele T was identified in rs2912010 (p=0.046). After data analysis, allele distribution of the MCPH1 polymorphisms was not different between breast cancer patients and healthy controls. But the polymorphism was associated with negative status for ER (rs2912010/C2302T; p=0.032, rs1057090/C2358T; p=0.027, rs2912016/C2494A; p=0.024), and allele T in both rs2912010 and rs1057090 was associated with increasing tumor grade (rs2912010; p=0.040, rs1057090; p=0.043) in breast cancer. We are first to report that association of MCPH1 protein expression and its polymorphisms in breast cancer. The MCPH1 polymorphisms and protein expression were associated with tumorigenesis in breast cancer and may be a useful biomarker for identification of the aggressive types of breast cancer.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA damage 3aalleles 3aanimal ovaries 3abiomarkers 3abreast neoplasms 3acarcinogenesis 3aovarian neoplasms 3apatients 3aprotein synthesis 3arisk 2aAdult 2aAged 2aBreast Neoplasmsxgeneticsxpathology. 2aFemale 2aHumans 2aMiddle Aged 2aNerve Tissue Proteinsxgenetics 2aPolymorphism, Single Nucleotide 2aReceptors, Estrogenxgenetics 0aKorea (South) 0aMCPH1 0aBRCA1 0aBRCT domain 0aBRIT1 0aER 0aPR 0aHER2 0aTMA 0aMicrocephalin 0aMCPH1 0aBreast cancer 0aPolymorphisms1 aKim, Hye Ok1 aLee, Juhie1 aLee, Sang Sook1 aCho, Chang Hoon1 aKang, In Sug1 aChoe, Won Jae1 aBaik, Hyung Hwan1 aYoon, Kyung-Sik0 tGene.g2013 Apr. 01, v. 517 p.184-190dElsevier B.V.x0378-11197nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gene.2012.12.0883Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02608naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002000144245012900164300002000293520101600313592002801329650004401357650002201401650001501423650002301438650001301461650004401474650001901518650001901537650003101556650001401587650001101601650001301612650001301625653001901638653001201657653002401669653001301693653001901706700002101725700002001746700002101766700002001787700002101807700002501828700002301853773012501876856008002001852000902081655001202090IND60569471920170710000000.0170531e20170531xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056947192DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.7b021612doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEl-Roz, Mohamad10aHigh-Visible-Light Photoactivity of Plasma-Promoted Vanadium Clusters on Nanozeolites for Partial Photooxidation of Methanol  ap. 17846-17855.  aCold VCl₃–plasma is employed for the preparation of highly dispersed vanadium oxide clusters on nanosized zeolite. Different types of zeolites, such as EMT, FAU (z.X), and Beta, are used. The activity of the prepared catalysts is studied in the selective photooxidation of methanol under polychromatic visible and UV irradiations. The physicochemical properties and catalytic performance of plasma-treated zeolite Beta (P-V₂O₅@Beta) catalyst is compared with zeolite Beta (V₂O₅@Beta) and amorphous silica (V₂O₅@SiO₂) impregnated vanadium oxide catalysts. Pure V₂O₅ is used as a reference material. The set of catalytic data shows that plasma-prepared zeolite Beta based catalyst displays the highest activity. Complementary characterization techniques including XRD, N₂-sorption, FTIR, ionic exchange, pyridine adsorption, Raman, NMR, TPR, and EDX-TEM are used to study the impact of the preparation approach on the physicochemical properties and catalytic performance of photocatalysts.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aX-ray diffraction 3aadsorption 3acatalytic activity 3amethanol 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aphotocatalysts 3aphotooxidation 3aphysicochemical properties 3apyridines 3asilica 3avanadium 3azeolites 0aphotocatalysis 0azeolite 0aselective oxidation 0amethanol 0avanadium oxide1 aLakiss, Louwanda1 aTelegeiev, Igor1 aLebedev, Oleg I.1 aBazin, Philippe1 aVicente, Aurelie1 aFernandez, Christian1 aValtchev, Valentin0 tACS Applied Materials & Interfaces.g2017 May 31, v. 9, no. 21 p.17846-17855dAmerican Chemical Societyx1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facsami.7b021613Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01500naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001700143245007400160300001700234520036500251592002800616650002300644650001900667650001200686650001900698650002600717650001300743653001100756653001400767653001300781653002600794653001200820653001200832653001200844700002000856773015200876856007701028852000901105655001201114IND60522963720221118013222.0160605e20140602xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052296372DNAL7 a10.1515/znc-1999-12012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBecker, Hans10aTerpenoids from the in vitro Cultured Liverwort Riella helicophylla§  ap. 997-1004.  aThe liverwort Riella helicophylla was cultivated in vitro under aseptic conditions.

To this goal, we systematically investigate the affect of layer thickness, electrical field and strain on the electronic properties of the C2N nanosheet. By increasing the thickness of C2N, we observed that the band gap decreases. Moreover, by applying an electrical field to bilayer C2N, the band gap decreases and a semiconductor-to-metal transition can occur. Our results also confirm that uniaxial and biaxial strain can effectively alter the band gap of C2N monolayer. Furthermore, we show that the electronic and magnetic properties of C2N can be modified by the adsorption and substitution of various atoms. Depending on the species of embedded atoms, they may induce semiconductor (O, C, Si and Be), metal (S, N, P, Na, K, Mg and Ca), dilute-magnetic semiconductor (H, F, B), or ferro-magnetic-metal (Cl, Li) character in C2N monolayer. It was also found that the inclusion of hydrogen or oxygen impurities and nitrogen vacancies, can induce magnetism in the C2N monolayer. These extensive calculations can be useful to guide future studies to modify the electronic/optical properties of two-dimensional materials.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3aberyllium 3aboron 3acalcium 3acarbon 3achlorine 3aelectric field 3afluorine 3ahydrogen 3alithium 3amagnesium 3amagnetic properties 3amagnetism 3ananosheets 3anitrogen 3aoptical properties 3aoxygen 3aphosphorus 3apotassium 3asemiconductors 3asilicon 3asodium 3asulfur 0aC2N nanosheet 0aDefect and strain engineering 0aElectronic structure 0aImpurity of atom1 aStampfl, Catherine1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9297-73821 aGhergherehchi, Mitra1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5652-49601 aFarjami Shayesteh, Saber1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3073-44060 tCarbon.g2020 Feb., v. 157 p.371-384dElsevier LtdwJournal:11670x0008-62237nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbon.2019.10.0383Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01601naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001900143245008100162300001800243520046200261592002800723650001300751650001000764650001800774653002200792653001900814653001600833653002600849653001600875653001200891700002700903700001900930700002200949700001700971773015300988856007701141852000901218655001201227IND60522963820221118013246.0160605e20140602xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052296382DNAL7 a10.1515/znc-1999-12022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTofern, Britta10aArcapitins A - C, First Dammarane-Type Triterpenes from the Convolvulaceae§  ap. 1005-1010.  aThree new dammarane-type triterpenes, named arcapitin A, B and C, were isolated from the roots of Argyreia capitata (Convolvulaceae).

Quantifying lake evaporation in hyper-arid regions by measurement and estimation can both provide reliable potential evaporation (ET<inf>0</inf>) reference and promote a deeper understanding of the regional hydrological process and its response towards changing climate. We placed a floating E601 evaporation pan on East Juyan Lake, which is representative of arid regions’ terminal lakes, to measure daily evaporation and conducted simultaneous bankside synoptic observation during the growing season of 2013–2015. A semi-empirical evaporation model derived from Dalton model was parameterized and validated with measured data. The model was then used to estimate lake evaporation during 2002–2015. According to in situ measurements, maximum, minimum and mean lake evaporation were 8.1, 3.7 and 6.5 mm/day, and growing season evaporation was 1183.3 mm (~80% of the annual amount). Adding up non-growing season evaporation that we converted from φ20 pan evaporation at Ejina weather station, the annual mean lake evaporation, 1471.3 mm, was representative of lower Heihe River’s ET<inf>0</inf>. Model inter-comparison implied our model performed well both in simplicity and accuracy and has potential utilization in a data-sparse area. In 2002–2015, estimated mean daily evaporation was 6.5 mm/day and growing season evaporation was 1233.7 mm. Trend analysis of estimated evaporation proved the evaporation paradox’s existence in this hyper-arid region and validated complementary relationship theory’s adaptability.  aPublisher supplied data 3aarid zones 3aclimate change 3aevaporation 3agrowing season 3ahydrologic cycle 3alakes 3arivers 3aweather1 aYu, Jingjie1 aWang, Ping1 aZhang, Yichi1 aDu, Chaoyang0 tWater.g2016 Nov. 12, v. 8, no. 11dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21688x2073-44417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w81105273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01273naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001600146245013200162300001400294520024200308592002800550650001600578650001900594651001000613653001600623653001800639653001300657653001500670653001300685653001000698700001600708700001500724773009400739856008100833852000900914655001200923IND60699271420221122000455.0210117e20140123xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069927142DNAL7 a10.3897/zookeys.373.65562doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWei, Na-sen10aContributions to the knowledge of the Chinese Primeuchroeus Linsenmaier, 1968 (Hymenoptera, Chrysididae), with a key to species  ap. 43-56.  aThe genus Primeuchroeus Linsenmaier, 1968 from China is revised and an illustrated identification key is produced for the first time.

The formation of an intermolecular dimer based on the glucose molecule through Schiff base cyclization can lead to a competitive reaction with 1,2-enolization to reduce 5-hydroxymethyl-2-furaldehyde formation, which might be another factor in reducing the formation of high-molecular weight polymers.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMaillard reaction 3aglucose 3aheat treatment 3ahydroxymethylfurfural 3amolecular weight 3apolymerization 3apolymers 3aschiff bases 2aAnimals 2aFood Technologyxmethods 2aFuraldehydexanalogs & derivativesxmetabolism. 2aHot Temperature 2aMagnetic Resonance Spectroscopy 2aMaillard Reaction 2aMilkxmetabolism 2aMolecular Weight 2aPolymersxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aSchiff Basesxmetabolism 2aSpectrometry, Mass, Electrospray Ionization 2aSulfitesxmetabolism 0a5-hydroxymethyl-2-furaldehyde 0apolymer 0asulfite group1 aZhu, Si-Ming1 aYu, Shu-Juan1 aXu, Xian-Bing1 aZhu, Li-Cai0 tJournal of dairy science.g2013 May, v. 96, no. 5 p.2826-2831dElsevier Inc.aAmerican Dairy Science AssociationwJournal:jnl45500x0022-03027nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3168/jds.2012-60563Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02416naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094024002200128024001900150040001800169100002100187245005900208300001400267506007600281520090100357592002801258596011601286506003701402650001601439650001201455650002301467650000901490650001601499653002701515653004101542653001501583653001401598653000901612653001801621700002401639700001701663700001801680700006001698773011101758856008001869852000901949655001201958IND60645925720221207133317.0190604e201902  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064592572DNAL7 a10.1177/00236772187650322doi7 aPMC62036552pmcid7 a296499322pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNosaka, Nobuyuki10aOptimal tube length of orotracheal intubation for mice  ap. 79-83.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aEndotracheal tube (ETT) management is an essential technique in handling mice with mechanical ventilators. Malposition into bronchi causes not only lethal complications for them but also less efficient mechanical ventilation. However, in general, it is difficult to know whether the ETT is placed with appropriate depth into the trachea of mice. We measured the distance from incisors to the bifurcation of trachea of multiple mice, and created a new estimation formula to obtain the suitable ETT length for mice with a body weight range from 17 g to 25 g: length (mm) = 0.5 × bodyweight (g) + 7. However, millimeter step adjustments are impracticable. Thus, slightly shorter than 2 cm (18–20 mm) may be the universal ETT length for mice with bodyweight > 17 g. Furthermore, their foot size may be a good alternative to predict the individual optimal ETT length for mice.  aPublisher supplied data  a1R01-HL130353-01cNational Heart, Lung, and Blood Institutedhttps://doi.org/https://doi.org/10.13039/1000000500 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abody weight 3abronchi 3alaboratory animals 3amice 3aventilators 0amechanical ventilation 0anon-invasive endotracheal intubation 0aestimation 0afoot size 0amice 0atube position1 aCrother, Timothy R.1 aChen, Shuang1 aArditi, Moshe1 aShimada, Kenichi1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8213-56860 tLaboratory animals.g2019 Feb., v. 53, no. 1 p.79-83dSAGE PublicationswJournal:jnl45492x1758-11177nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/00236772187650323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02598naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001500143245021800158300001800376520108300394592002801477650001701505650001301522650001901535650001701554650000901571650001501580650001301595650002701608650002901635650004401664650001601708653000901724653001801733653001601751653004401767700001701811700001901828700001901847700001801866700001701884773015201901856007802053852000902131655001202140IND60083469420221120084433.0190215e201305  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008346942DNAL7 a10.3168/jds.2012-64512doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZironi, E.10aTechnical note: Development and validation of a method using ultra performance liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry for determination of vitamin B12 concentrations in milk and dairy products  ap. 2832-2836.  aA method using ultra performance liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry was developed to measure cobalamins in naturally enriched raw milk and to evaluate their fate during thermal treatments and along the process of cheese making. After addition of methotrexate as internal standard, samples were submitted to heat treatment in the presence of cyanide, which converts all the less-stable cobalamins into cyanocobalamin; then, purification was performed by a solid-phase extraction step. Reverse-phase ultra performance liquid chromatography separation coupled with tandem mass spectrometry provided a fast and reliable determination. Mass spectrometric analysis was carried out in multiple reaction monitoring mode. The monitored transitions were m/z 678.36 → 147.10 and 678.36 → 359.30 for vitamin B12 and m/z 455.22 → 175.13 and 455.22 → 308.22 for methotrexate (internal standard). The limit of quantification was 2ng/g.

MBDPP was subsequently applied for the fabrication of intrinsically anti-flammable bismaleimide (BMI) thermosets. The effect of MBDPP on the curing kinetics of BMI systems was investigated by the non-isothermal DSC technology, showing that the addition of MBDPP increased the reaction activation energy of the BMI system owing to the steric hindrance of MBDPP. With only 2 wt% of MBDPP, the BMI thermoset achieved an LOI of 35.0% and UL-94 V-0 grade. Besides, the PHRR, MARHE, THE, TSP and mean SEA of the BMI thermoset with 2 wt% of MBDPP were declined by 26%, 33%, 27%, 34% and 50%, respectively, compared to those of the unmodified BMI. The enhanced anti-flammability and smoke suppression performances of the BMI thermosets were attributed to the formation of an intact, expansive and thermally resistant char layer by the presence of MBDPP. Such a char layer effectively blocked the transportation of combustible degradation products to the flame and the thermal radiation of heat to the polymer matrix, so as to slow down the heat release rate and smoke emission.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactivation energy 3abiphenyl 3adegradation 3aheat 3amagnolol 3apolymers 3asmoke 3athermal radiation 3atransportation 0aMagnolol 0aBismaleimide 0aIntrinsic anti-flammability 0aSmoke suppression1 aLiang, Fuwei1 aChen, Shun1 aZhang, Diantang1 aFeixing,1 aQian, Kun1 aXu, Yang1 aFei, Bin0 tPolymer degradation and stability.g2022 Aug., v. 202 p.110002-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12486x0141-39107nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.polymdegradstab.2022.1100023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03065naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245006900167300001800236520197200254592002802226650003402254650001402288650001802302650001902320650001802339650001102357650002402368650001702392650001502409650001502424650001302439700002002452700002002472773010602492856008402598852000902682655001202691IND60112871620221119064703.0141111e20110909xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011287162DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chroma.2011.01.0632doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAdelmann, S.10aMultiphase flow modeling in centrifugal partition chromatography  ap. 6092-6101.  aThe separation efficiency in Centrifugal Partition Chromatography (CPC) depends on selection of a suitable biphasic solvent system (distribution ratio, selectivity factor, sample solubility) and is influenced by hydrodynamics in the chambers. Especially the stationary phase retention, the interfacial area for mass transfer and the flow pattern (backmixing) are important parameters. Their relationship with physical properties, operating parameters and chamber geometry is not completely understood and predictions are hardly possible. Experimental flow visualization is expensive and two-dimensional only. Therefore we simulated the flow pattern using a volume-of-fluid (VOF) method, which was implemented in OpenFOAM®. For the three-dimensional simulation of a rotating FCPC®-chamber, gravitational centrifugal and Coriolis forces were added to the conservation equation. For experimental validation the flow pattern of different solvent systems was visualized with an optical measurement system. The amount of mobile phase in a chamber was calculated from gray scale values of videos recorded by an image processing routine in ImageJ®. To visualize the flow of the stationary phase polyethylene particles were used to perform a qualitative particle image velocimetry (PIV) analysis. We found a good agreement between flow patterns and velocity profiles of experiments and simulations. By using the model we found that increasing the chamber depth leads to higher specific interfacial area. Additionally a circular flow in the stationary phase was identified that lowers the interfacial area because it pushes the jet of mobile phase to the chamber wall. The Coriolis force alone gives the impulse for this behavior. As a result the model is easier to handle than experiments and allows 3D prediction of hydrodynamics in the chamber. Additionally it can be used for optimizing geometry and operating parameters for given physical properties of solvent systems.  aPublisher supplied data 3acountercurrent chromatography 3aequations 3ahydrodynamics 3aimage analysis 3amass transfer 3amodels 3aphysical properties 3apolyethylene 3aprediction 3asolubility 3asolvents1 aSchwienheer, C.1 aSchembecker, G.0 tJournal of chromatography.g2011 Sept. 9, v. 1218, no. 36 p.6092-6101dElsevier B.V.x0021-96737nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chroma.2011.01.0633Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02083naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002300148245012400171300001600295520090200311592002801213650001501241650001001256650001501266650002501281650001301306650001401319650001101333653003401344653001601378653002701394653001201421700001901433700002001452700002201472773011101494856008301605852000901688655001201697IND60553582620221123004101.0180831e20161115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055358262DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bios.2016.05.0812doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAbdel-Haleem, F.M.10aMolecularly imprinted polymer-based bulk optode for the determination of itopride hydrochloride in physiological fluids  ap. 740-742.  aWe report here for the first time on the use of Molecularly Imprinted Polymers as modifiers in bulk optodes, Miptode, for the determination of a pharmaceutical compound, itopride hydrochloride as an example in a concentration range of 1×10⁻¹–1×10⁻⁴molL⁻¹.

In the current study, we have examined the role of QY on the aggregation propensity of hen egg-white lysozyme (HEWL) under physiological conditions. The dye induced conformational changes in HEWL leading to aggregate formation were identified by circular dichroism (CD), turbidity analysis, fluorescence measurement and microscopic (TEM) imaging. Molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulation studies were also employed to strengthen binding and aggregation results. Our results indicate that 25–100 µM of QY induces aggregation in HEWL, while lower QY concentrations (5 and 10 µM) does not have any effect on the aggregation propensity of HEWL. The kinetics of HEWL aggregation demonstrate nucleation independent aggregation of HEWL without lag phase. On the other hand, far UV-CD analysis illustrated the loss of α-helical structure with the increasing concentration of QY. TEM results also support the formation of aggregate structures in HEWL when exposed to QY. Molecular docking and simulation studies revealed that the HEWL-QY complex is stable as compared to individual entities. In silico analysis also illustrated that QY-induced aggregation of HEWL proceeds through the formation of hydrogen bonds, electrostatic (Pi-Anion) and Pi-Sulfur interactions. The above-mentioned results highlight the possible detrimental effect by food additive dyes, particularly in protein misfolding.  aThe authors extend their appreciation to the Deanship of Scientific Research at King Saud University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia for funding this research through Protein Research Chair.  aPublisher supplied data  cDeanship of Scientific Research at King Saud University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia 3abiotechnology 3acircular dichroism spectroscopy 3acomputer simulation 3adyes 3aegg albumen 3afluorescence 3afood additives 3ahens 3ahydrogen 3alysozyme 3amolecular dynamics 3aprotein folding 3aquinoline 3aturbidity 0aCircular dichroism 0aprotein aggregation 0aquinoline yellow1 aBhatt, Sheraz1 aTabrez, Shams1 aRehman, Md Tabish1 aAlokail, Majed Saleh1 aAlAjmi, Mohamed F.0 tPreparative biochemistry & biotechnology.g2020 Aug. 3, v. 50, no. 7 p.673-681dTaylor & FranciswJournal:12249x1532-22977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10826068.2020.17257743Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02620naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002900151245008300180300001600263500001900279520135900298592002801657650001801685650002501703650001501728650001101743650002801754650001501782650001701797650002501814650001101839653001501850653002301865653001501888653002701903700002801930700002501958773013301983856008502116852000902201655001202210IND60705420120221122025402.0200804e20200803xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070542012DNAL7 a10.1080/10826068.2020.17286962doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGomes, Tatiane Aparecida13aAn overview of cell disruption methods for intracellular biomolecules recovery  ap. 635-654.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aBacteria, yeast, and microalgae are sources of biomolecules such as enzymes, lipids, pigments, organic acids and, proteins for industrial application. These high-added-value biomolecules are often intracellularly bioaccumulated, and their recovery involves several downstream processes, in which the most crucial stage is the disruption of the cell wall. The choice of the method influences the further downstream steps and, consequently, its complexity and cost. In this review, severe and gentle methods currently used for disruption or permeabilization of bacteria, yeast, and microalgae were discussed based on their principle, application, and feasibility. Also, recent studies regarding the microbial cell disruption were presented in order to facilitate the choice of the more effective method. Some factors such as cell wall composition, nature of biomolecule, purity degree, scalability, and energy input are necessary to be considered on selecting the most appropriate disruption method. The severe methods, such as high pressure-homogenization, and ultrasonication present higher yield, lower cost, and feasibility to scale-up when compared to the gentle methods. However, in order to achieve a higher recovery yield, further studies must focus on the optimization of operational parameters and on the combination of severe and gentle methods.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiotechnology 3acell wall components 3acell walls 3aenergy 3aindustrial applications 3amicroalgae 3apermeability 3aultrasonic treatment 3ayeasts 0aCell lysis 0adisruption methods 0adownstream 0aintracellular products1 aZanette, Cristina Maria1 aSpier, Michele Rigon0 tPreparative biochemistry & biotechnology.g2020 Aug. 3, v. 50, no. 7 p.635-654dTaylor & FranciswJournal:12249x1532-22977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10826068.2020.17286963Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01597naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100003200146245016600178300001400344500001400358520035800372592002800730650001600758650001500774650001500789650001100804650001200815650001000827650001900837650001900856651001100875653001500886653001300901653003000914653001800944653001600962700002500978773009401003856008101097852000901178655001201187IND60699271920221122000834.0210117e20140128xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069927192DNAL7 a10.3897/zookeys.374.61882doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 ade Sousa, Viviane Rodrigues10aRedescription of Japanagromyza inferna Spencer, first recorded from Brazil, and a key to the Neotropical species of Japanagromyza Sasakawa (Diptera, Agromyzidae)  ap. 45-55.  aNAL-light  aJapanagromyza inferna Spencer is recorded for the first time from Brazil, in the North coast of the State of Rio de Janeiro, inducing galls in Centrosema virginianum L.

ELP-OPH was simply purified from genetically engineered Escherichia coli based on the unique phase transition of ELP and thus served as biocatalyst for OPs, while BSA was used to stabilize OPH activity in the nanocomposite. TiO2NFs was employed to enrich organophosphates in the nanocomposite due to its strong affinity with phosphoric group in OPs, while c-MWCNTs was used to enhance the electron transfer in the amperometric detection as well as for covalent immobilization of ELP-OPH. ELP-OPH/BSA/TiO2NFs/c-MWCNTs nanocomposite were systematically characterized using field emission scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Raman spectra, Fourier Transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and X-ray Diffraction (XRD). Under the optimized operating conditions, the ELP-OPH/BSA/TiO2NFs/c-MWCNTs based biosensor for OPs shows a wide linear range, a fast response (less than 5s) and limits of detection (S/N=3) as low as 12nM and 10nM for methyl parathion and parathion, respectively. Such excellent sensing performance can be attributed to the synergistic effects of the individual components in the nanocomposite. Its further application for selectively monitoring OPs compounds spiked in lake water samples was also demonstrated with good accuracy. These features indicate that the developed nanocomposite offers an excellent biosensing platform for rapid, sensitive and selective detection of organophosphates compounds.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aRaman spectroscopy 3aX-ray diffraction 3abiocatalysts 3abiosensors 3abovine serum albumin 3acarbon nanotubes 3adetection limit 3aelectron transfer 3agenetic engineering 3alakes 3amonitoring 3ananocomposites 3ananofibers 3aparathion 3aparathion-methyl 3aphase transition 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asynergism 3atitanium dioxide 0aELP-OPH 0aTitanium dioxide nanofibers 0aMulti-walled carbon nanotubes 0aMethyl parathion 0aParathion1 aHou, Changjun1 aDong, Qiuchen1 aMa, Xiaoyu1 aChen, Jun1 aHuo, Danqun1 aYang, Mei1 aGalil, Khaled Hussein Abd El1 aChen, Wilfred1 aLei, Yu0 tBiosensors & bioelectronics.g2016 Nov. 15, v. 85 p.935-942dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11631x0956-56637nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bios.2016.05.0943Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02078naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001300149245009700162500001900259520110700278592002801385650001601413650002001429650001501449650001101464650001001475700002101485700001501506700001801521773013301539856008301672852000901755655001201764IND60735019720221117160949.0210423e20210416xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073501972DNAL7 a10.3390/agriculture110403592doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYe, Kai 12aA Heterogeneous Graph Enhanced LSTM Network for Hog Price Prediction Using Online Discussion  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aForecasting the prices of hogs has always been a popular field of research. Such information has played an essential role in decision-making for farmers, consumers, corporations, and governments. It is hard to predict hog prices because too many factors can influence them. Some of the factors are easy to quantify, but some are not. Capturing the characteristics behind the price data is also tricky considering their non-linear and non-stationary nature. To address these difficulties, we propose Heterogeneous Graph-enhanced LSTM (HGLTSM), which is a method that predicts weekly hog price. In this paper, we first extract the historical prices of necessary agricultural products in recent years. Then, we utilize discussions from the online professional community to build heterogeneous graphs. These graphs have rich information of both discussions and the engaged users. Finally, we construct HGLSTM to make the prediction. The experimental results demonstrate that forum discussions are beneficial to hog price prediction. Moreover, our method exhibits a better performance than existing methods.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagriculture 3adecision making 3aprediction 3aprices 3aswine1 aPiao, Yangheran 1 aZhao, Kun 1 aCui, Xiaohui 0 tAgriculture (Basel).g2021 Apr. 16, v. 11, no. 4dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:12387x2077-04727nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agriculture110403593Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01765naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002100146245016300167300001400330500001400344520059900358592002800957650001800985650000801003650001801011650002401029650001601053651001301069651001401082653002801096653001301124653002601137653002701163700001701190773009401207856008101301852000901382655001201391IND60699272020221121224154.0210117e20140129xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069927202DNAL7 a10.3897/zookeys.374.58742doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHosoishi, Shingo10aDescription and DNA barcoding of Crematogaster fraxatrix Forel, 1911 and two new closely related species from Cambodia and Indonesia (Hymenoptera, Formicidae)  ap. 57-68.  aNAL-light  aCrematogaster fraxatrix Forel, 1911 and two new species, C. chhangisp. n. and C. simbolonisp. n., are described from Cambodia and Indonesia, respectively.

Increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases have caused changes in extreme climate events. We have studied index rainfall extream trend at two meteorological stations of Sultan Iskandar Muda in Banda Aceh and Cut Nyak Dien in Meulaboh from 1982-2013. Daily rainfall data were processed using software of RClimDex to obtain the extreme rainfall index. Such indexes are extreme climate index set by the expert team for Climate Change Detection Monitoring and Indices (ETCCDMI) including of maximum 1-day and 5-days precipitation amount (RX1day and RX5day), total annual precipitation (PRCPTOT), consecutive dry days (CDD), consecutive wet days (CWD), very wet days (R95p), extremely wet days (R99p) and heavy precipitation days (R20mm). Based on our study, we found that the PRCPTOT tend to decrease, whereas occurances of RX1day and RX5day increase. The Banda Aceh station which has a monsoonal pattern is charaterized by increasing in R95p and R99p as well as but decreasing in R20mm. The CWD and CDD tend to accumulate at once. The Meulaboh station that has the type of equatorial rain show decreasing trend in R95p and R99p, but increasing trend in R20mm. The CWD and CDD occur within some days. The projection Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP) 4.5 and 8.5 from 2014-2050 showed an increasing pattern frequency of rain in Banda Aceh and a decreasing pattern in Meulaboh.

No differences were observed for all the samples in FTIR spectra results. Acorn starches showed a C-type pattern, with a relative crystallinity between 43.1 and 46.6%. The ¹³C CP/MAS NMR spectra are different for the used isolation methods but are similar for both acorn species. However, acorn-isolated starches presented a predominant A-type allomorph packing type, and the A3S starches showed a higher degree of crystalline material. Those differences in the structure of acorn starches would be helpful to better understand the relationships among structure and functional properties for a possible potential industrial application of chestnut starches.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aCastanea 3aQuercus ilex subsp. rotundifolia 3aQuercus suber 3aacorns 3aagriculture 3acrystal structure 3aindustrial applications 3astarch 0aacorn starch 0amorphology 0aX-ray diffraction 0aFTIR 0aNMR1 aCruz-Lopes, Luísa1 aBeirão-da-Costa, Luísa0 tOpen Agriculture.g2021 Feb. 04, v. 6, no. 1 p.37-46dDe GruyterwJournal:23162x2391-95317nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1515/opag-2021-02143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04934naa a2200757 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003100113040001800144100003400162245010700196300001800303520251700321592002802838650002702866650002002893650001402913650003702927650003702964650000903001650001603010650001703026650001003043650002203053650001003075650001703085650001403102650001903116650001703135650000903152650001203161650001503173650001603188650003003204650002503234650001703259650002003276650001603296650001203312650001103324650002703335650001103362650003103373650003503404650002303439650004203462650005703504650002903561650004103590650003603631653003703667653002003704653003003724653002103754700002603775700003903801700002603840700004003866700001903906773015203925856007804077852000904155655001204164IND60083469820221120084352.0190215e201305  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008346982DNAL7 a234778222pmid7 a10.3168/jds.2012-58642doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 ade Freitas Guimarães, Felipe10aEnterotoxin genes in coagulase-negative and coagulase-positive staphylococci isolated from bovine milk  ap. 2866-2872.  aThe objective of this study was to isolate and identify the main staphylococcal species causing bovine mastitis in 10 Brazilian dairy herds and study their capability to produce enterotoxins. Herds were selected based on size and use of milking technology, and farms were visited once during the study. All mammary glands of all lactating cows were screened using the California Mastitis Test (CMT) and a strip cup. A single aseptic milk sample (20mL) was collected from all CMT-positive quarters. Identification of Staphylococcus spp. was performed using conventional microbiology, and PCR was used to determine the presence of enterotoxin-encoding genes (sea, seb, sec, and sed). Of the 1,318 CMT-positive milk samples, Staphylococcus spp. were isolated from 263 (19.9%). Of these isolates, 135 (51%) were coagulase-positive staphylococci (CPS) and 128 (49%) were coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS). Eighteen different species of CNS were isolated, among which S. warneri, S. epidermidis and S. hyicus were the most frequent. The distribution of Staphylococcus species was different among herds: S. epidermidis was found in 8 herds, S. warneri was found in 7 herds, and S. hyicus in 6 herds. Some of the CNS species (S. saprophyticus ssp. saprophyticus, S. auricularis, S. capitis, and S. chromogenes) were isolated in only one of the farms. Genes related to production of enterotoxins were found in 66% (n=85) of all CNS and in 35% of the CPS isolates. For both CNS and CPS isolates, the most frequently identified enterotoxin genes were sea, seb, and sec; the prevalence of sea differed between CPS (9.5%) and CNS (35.1%) isolates. Staphylococcus warneri isolates showed a greater percentage of sea than seb, sec, or sed, whereas S. hyicus isolates showed a greater percentage of sea than sec. Over 60% of CNS belonged to 3 major species, which carried 62.2 to 81.3% of the enterotoxin genes. The high prevalence highlights the potential for food poisoning caused by these species. For possible high-risk situations for food poisoning, such as milk produced with total bacterial counts greater than regulatory levels and stored under inappropriate temperatures, monitoring contamination with CNS could be important to protect human health. Because the prevalence of CNS intramammary infections in dairy herds is usually high, and these species can be found in great numbers in bulk milk, identification of risk factors for production of staphylococcal enterotoxins should be considered in future studies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aStaphylococcus warneri 3abovine mastitis 3abulk milk 3acoagulase negative staphylococci 3acoagulase positive staphylococci 3acows 3adairy herds 3aenterotoxins 3afarms 3afoodborne illness 3agenes 3ahuman health 3alactation 3amammary glands 3amicrobiology 3amilk 3amilking 3amonitoring 3aplate count 3apolymerase chain reaction 3aproduction economics 3arisk factors 3asterilized milk 3atemperature 2aAnimals 2aCattle 2aEnterotoxinsxgenetics 2aFemale 2aGenes, Bacterialxgenetics 2aMastitis, Bovinexmicrobiology 2aMilkxmicrobiology 2aPolymerase Chain Reactionxveterinary 2aStaphylococcal Infectionsxmicrobiologyxveterinary. 2aStaphylococcusxgenetics 2aStaphylococcus epidermidisxgenetics 2aStaphylococcus hyicusxgenetics 0acoagulase-negative staphylococci 0abovine mastitis 0apolymerase chain reaction 0aenterotoxin gene1 aNóbrega, Diego Borin1 aRichini-Pereira, Virginia Bodelão1 aMarson, Pâmela Merlo1 ade Figueiredo Pantoja, José Carlos1 aLangoni, Helio0 tJournal of dairy science.g2013 May, v. 96, no. 5 p.2866-2872dElsevier Inc.aAmerican Dairy Science AssociationwJournal:jnl45500x0022-03027nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3168/jds.2012-58643Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04106naa a2200661 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024003800135040001800173100001800191245004400209300001600253506007600269520209800345592002802443506003702471650001902508650002402527650002302551650002602574650002102600650002202621650001502643650001402658650002402672650002502696650002502721650001202746650001102758650003302769650003302802650001902835650001302854650001502867650001502882650002002897650002802917651001802945653001502963653002602978653002203004653000903026653001503035700001303050700005903063700001703122700001503139700002503154700002203179700003203201773010503233856008503338852000903423655001203432IND60612982120221207104538.0201118e201811  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061298212DNAL7 a301031242pmid7 aPMC61928282pmcid7 a10.1016/j.envint.2018.07.0472doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhou, Xiaoqin10aReview of global sanitation development  ap. 246-261.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe implementation of the United Nations (UN) Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) has resulted in an increased focus on developing innovative, sustainable sanitation techniques to address the demand for adequate and equitable sanitation in low-income areas. We examined the background, current situation, challenges, and perspectives of global sanitation. We used bibliometric analysis and word cluster analysis to evaluate sanitation research from 1992 to 2016 based on the Science Citation Index EXPANDED (SCI-EXPANDED) and Social Sciences Citation Index (SSCI) databases. Our results show that sanitation is a comprehensive field connected with multiple categories, and the increasing number of publications reflects a strong interest in this research area. Most of the research took place in developed countries, especially the USA, although sanitation problems are more serious in developing countries. Innovations in sanitation techniques may keep susceptible populations from contracting diseases caused by various kinds of contaminants and microorganisms. Hence, the hygienization of human excreta, resource recovery, and removal of micro-pollutants from excreta can serve as effective sustainable solutions. Commercialized technologies, like composting, anaerobic digestion, and storage, are reliable but still face challenges in addressing the links between the political, social, institutional, cultural, and educational aspects of sanitation. Innovative technologies, such as Microbial Fuel Cells (MFCs), Microbial Electrolysis Cells (MECs), and struvite precipitation, are at the TRL (Technology readiness levels) 8 level, meaning that they qualify as “actual systems completed and qualified through test and demonstration.” Solutions that take into consideration economic feasibility and all the different aspects of sanitation are required. There is an urgent demand for holistic solutions considering government support, social acceptability, as well as technological reliability that can be effectively adapted to local conditions.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aUnited Nations 3aanaerobic digestion 3aat-risk population 3abibliometric analysis 3acluster analysis 3acommercialization 3acomposting 3adatabases 3adeveloped countries 3adeveloping countries 3aeconomic feasibility 3aexcreta 3ahumans 3amagnesium ammonium phosphate 3amicrobial electrolysis cells 3amicroorganisms 3apolitics 3apollutants 3asanitation 3asocial sciences 3asustainable development 3aUnited States 0aSanitation 0aBibliometric analysis 0aResearch hotspots 0aGaps 0aChallenges1 aLi, Zifu1 aZheng, Tianlong1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3479-76041 aYan, Yichang1 aLi, Pengyu1 aOdey, Emmanuel Alepu1 aMang, Heinz Peter1 aUddin, Sayed Mohammad Nazim0 tEnvironment international.g2018 Nov., v. 120 p.246-261dElsevier LtdwJournal:6374x0160-41207nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envint.2018.07.0473Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02047naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245007200170520083900242592002801081650001601109650003601125650001601161650001701177650002001194650001201214650001601226653002501242653002001267653003801287700002101325700006201346700002001408700002901428773012201457856008501579852000901664655001201673IND60732964720221122194618.0211213e202106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073296472DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jasrep.2021.1029402doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChiti, Maurizio10aMicro X-ray fluorescence analysis of Roman Imperial coins from Nero  aA group of 364 Roman Imperial coins, issued by Nero (37–68 A.D.) and exhibited at the National Archaeological Museum of Florence, was non-invasively investigated by micro X-ray fluorescence analysis. The research aimed at correlating the events of Nero’s monetary policy, mainly the reform of 64 A.D., with possible variations in the weight and composition of coinage. We observed that the reform produced: a) weight reduction and/or debasement for both precious metal and orichalcum coinage and b) higher disorder in the coinage production of 64 A.D. and the immediately subsequent years. Thanks to the capability of performing measurements on the small patina-free areas already present on the coin, with no need for abrasion, micro X-ray fluorescence proves an effective option for the non-invasive analysis of ancient coinage.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-radiation 3aX-ray fluorescence spectroscopy 3aarchaeology 3afluorescence 3amonetary policy 3amuseums 3aweight loss 0aRoman Imperial coins 0aNero’s reform 0aMicro X-ray fluorescence analysis1 aEsposito, Adolfo1 aGorghinian, Astrik1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8802-33271 aFerretti, Marco1 aCatalli, F.q(Fiorenzo),0 tJournal of archaeological science: Reports.g2021 June, v. 37 p.102940-dElsevier LtdwJournal:26843x2352-409X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jasrep.2021.1029403Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03481naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100005700152245012700209520167300336592002802009650001902037650002002056650000802076650003202084650001602116650001102132650001802143650002502161650001102186650004202197650001902239650001602258650002402274650001002298650001402308650001702322650001202339653000802351653001102359653000902370653000802379653000802387653001102395653000802406653001902414653001802433653001502451653001702466653001302483700006202496700002002558700001402578700001402592700002802606700002702634773009802661856008702759852000902846655001202855IND60706776320221119054319.0201025e20201015xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070677632DNAL7 a10.1016/j.virusres.2020.1981122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHedil, Marcio1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8018-685010aNew features on the genomic organization of a novel dicistrovirus identified from the sweet potato whitefly Bemisia tabaci  aThe whitefly Bemisia tabaci is an agricultural pest causing large economic losses worldwide. We analysed the genomic sequence of a new viral member of the family Dicistroviridae identified by high-throughput sequencing of total RNA extracted from whiteflies. The virus, tentatively named Bemisia-associated dicistrovirus 2 (BaDV-2), has a genome of 8012 nucleotides with a polyadenylated 3′ end. In contrast to typical dicistroviruses, BaDV-2 has a genome containing three open reading frames (ORFs) encoding predicted proteins of 1078 (ORF1a), 481 (ORF1b) and 834 (ORF2) amino acids, which correspond to replicase A (containing helicase and cysteine protease domains), replicase B (a domain of an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase - RdRP) and capsid proteins, respectively. The 3′ end of ORF1a contains a potential frameshift signal, suggesting that ORF1a and ORF1b may be expressed as a single polyprotein (replicaseFS), corresponding to other dicistroviruses. The BaDV-2 genomic sequence shares the highest nucleotide identity (61.1 %) with Bemisia-associated dicistrovirus 1 (BaDV-1), another dicistrovirus identified from whiteflies. The full BaDV-2 replicaseFS polyprotein clustered with aparaviruses, whereas the capsid polyprotein clustered with cripaviruses in phylogenetic analyses, as with BaDV-1. The intergenic region (IGR) between ORF1b and ORF2 is predicted to adopt a secondary structure with atypical features that resembles the dicistrovirus IGR IRES structure. Our analyses indicate that BaDV-2 is a novel dicistrovirus and that BaDV-2 together with BaDV-1 may not be appropriately grouped in any of the three currently accepted dicistrovirus genera.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBemisia tabaci 3aDicistroviridae 3aRNA 3aRNA-directed RNA polymerase 3aamino acids 3acapsid 3acoat proteins 3acysteine proteinases 3agenome 3ahigh-throughput nucleotide sequencing 3aintergenic DNA 3anucleotides 3aopen reading frames 3apests 3aphylogeny 3apolyproteins 3aviruses 0aHTS 0aRT-PCR 0aIRES 0aIGR 0aORF 0aBaDV-2 0aUTR 0aPicornavirales 0aDicistrovirus 0aFrameshift 0aInsect virus 0aWhitefly1 aNakasu, Erich Y.T.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6275-83491 aNagata, Tatsuya1 aWen, Jing1 aJan, Eric1 aMichereff-Filho, Miguel1 aInoue-Nagata, Alice K.0 tVirus research.g2020 Oct. 15, v. 288 p.198112-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6283x0168-17027nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.virusres.2020.1981123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle05400naa a2200889 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003100113040001800144100001500162245012800177300001800305520270300323592002803026650002603054650001303080650002703093650002803120650001003148650002403158650001503182650001203197650002403209650001603233650001603249650001503265650002003280650001903300650003803319650001603357650002103373650002303394650001203417650001203429650004303441650001103484650001703495650001703512650001103529650002203540650001503562650001303577650001203590650001603602650000903618650002503627650003303652650004503685650001203730650002803742650002403770650001103794650002303805650001303828650003803841650001103879650004103890650002003931650004003951650007503991650004204066653002404108653001404132653001204146653001504158700001804173700002004191700001704211700001704228700001404245773015204259856007804411852000904489655001204498IND60083470020221120103205.0190215e201305  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008347002DNAL7 a234980042pmid7 a10.3168/jds.2012-59092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLaeger, T.10aConcentrations of hormones and metabolites in cerebrospinal fluid and plasma of dairy cows during the periparturient period  ap. 2883-2893.  aDuring early lactation, high-yielding dairy cows often show insufficient feed intake (FI) and, as a consequence, they enter into a negative energy balance associated with an altered pattern of plasma metabolites and hormones. These act as short- and long-term hunger or satiety signals in the brain and play an important role in the control of FI. Metabolites and hormones also occur in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), which surrounds the hypothalamus and brainstem, 2 major centers of FI regulation. The CSF hormone and metabolite concentrations are mainly under control of the blood-brain barrier. Consequently, CSF hormone and metabolite concentrations differ from those in blood. However, the contribution of putative orexigenic and anorexigenic CSF signals possibly leading to insufficient FI of high-yielding dairy cows during early lactation has not been studied so far. Therefore, the aim of this study was to elucidate associations existing between both plasma and CSF hormones and metabolites during the periparturient period. Ten multiparous German Holstein dairy cows were fed ad libitum and samples of CSF from the spinal cord and blood from the jugular vein were withdrawn before morning feeding on d −20, −10, +1, +10, +20, and +40 relative to calving. Feed intake started to decrease from d 5 before calving and increased thereafter. Glucose, β-hydroxybutyrate (BHBA), cholesterol, nonesterified fatty acids, urea (all enzymatic), lactate (colorimetric), amino acids (HPLC), osmolality (osmometer), ghrelin (RIA), leptin (ELISA), and resistin (Western immunoblot) were measured in both CSF and plasma, whereas free fatty acids (gas chromatography-mass spectrometry) and volatile fatty acids (gas chromatography-flame-ionization detector) were determined in plasma only. Whereas leptin concentrations decreased after calving in both plasma and CSF, ghrelin concentrations were not altered, and abundances of total resistin and its hexamers decreased only in plasma. Although plasma concentrations of cholesterol and nonesterified fatty acids changed during the periparturient period, their concentrations were not affected in CSF. In contrast, CSF Gln concentration tended to increase until calving, whereas CSF concentrations of BHBA, α-aminobutyric acid, Cit, Gly, Ile, Val, and Leu were increased in early lactation compared with the preparturient period. Because Gln is known to serve as neuronal substrate generating ATP, Gln is suggested to act as a central anorexigenic signal shortly before parturition. Moreover, due to their known anorexic effect, BHBA and Leu may potentially act as central signals and thereby suppress a sufficient increase in FI during early lactation.  aPublisher supplied data 3a3-hydroxybutyric acid 3aHolstein 3aadenosine triphosphate 3aalpha-aminobutyric acid 3ablood 3ablood-brain barrier 3abrain stem 3acalving 3acerebrospinal fluid 3acholesterol 3acolorimetry 3adairy cows 3aearly lactation 3aenergy balance 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3afeed intake 3afree fatty acids 3agas chromatography 3aghrelin 3aglucose 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3ahunger 3ahypothalamus 3ajugular vein 3aleptin 3amass spectrometry 3aosmolality 3aresistin 3asatiety 3aspinal cord 3aurea 3avolatile fatty acids 2a3-Hydroxybutyric Acidxblood 2aAmino Acidsxbloodxcerebrospinal fluid. 2aAnimals 2aBlood Glucosexanalysis 2aBlood Urea Nitrogen 2aCattle 2aCholesterolxblood 2aDairying 2aFatty Acids, Nonesterifiedxblood 2aFemale 2aGhrelinxbloodxcerebrospinal fluid. 2aLactatesxblood 2aLeptinxbloodxcerebrospinal fluid. 2aPeripartum Periodxbloodxcerebrospinal fluidxmetabolismxphysiology. 2aResistinxbloodxcerebrospinal fluid. 0acerebrospinal fluid 0adairy cow 0ahormone 0ametabolite1 aSauerwein, H.1 aTuchscherer, A.1 aBellmann, O.1 aMetges, C.C.1 aKuhla, B.0 tJournal of dairy science.g2013 May, v. 96, no. 5 p.2883-2893dElsevier Inc.aAmerican Dairy Science AssociationwJournal:jnl45500x0022-03027nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3168/jds.2012-59093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02354naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001400149245014600163500001900309520110200328592002801430650001601458650001201474650001701486650001401503650001401517650001201531650002501543650001701568650001801585700001301603700001601616700001301632700002001645700002101665700001601686700001701702773013301719856008301852852000901935655001201944IND60735020120221119031413.0210423e20210416xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073502012DNAL7 a10.3390/agriculture110403622doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGuo, Jie 10aResearch on the Physical Characteristic Parameters of Banana Bunches for the Design and Development of Postharvesting Machinery and Equipment  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aIn the operations of the banana postharvesting process, the design and development related to the dehanding machine, the cutting and crushing machine of bunch stalks, and the fiber extraction machine of bunch stalks are in the initial stages. In addition, with the development of society and urbanization, the aging populations in hilly and mountainous areas, where bananas are planted, are becoming a more and more serious problem. The basic physical characteristic parameters of banana bunches, banana hands, and bunch stalks are the basis for studying their biomechanical properties and designing and developing the corresponding mechanical equipment. We measured the diameter, thickness of rind, curvature, density, moisture content, diameter of vascular bundle, weight of bunch stalk, and axial distance and circumferential angle of Brazilian and plantain banana hands using experiments and statistical analysis. Through the combination of physical experiments and numerical statistics, we obtained the value range and changing law of the physical characteristic parameters of banana bunches.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagriculture 3abananas 3abiomechanics 3aequipment 3amountains 3asociety 3astatistical analysis 3aurbanization 3awater content1 aFu, Han 1 aYang, Zhou 1 aLi, Jun 1 aJiang, Yinlong 1 aJiang, Tingting 1 aLiu, Enxiu 1 aDuan, Jieli 0 tAgriculture (Basel).g2021 Apr. 16, v. 11, no. 4dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:12387x2077-04727nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agriculture110403623Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03087naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100005400150245010900204300001600313520162400329592002801953650001501981650002001996650002402016650002602040650001902066650001402085650002102099650001802120650000902138650002402147650002202171650001802193650001802211650002502229651001002254653001502264653001602279653001302295653001302308653001202321653001602333700002402349700002102373773010502394856008502499852000902584655001202593IND60612982520221119165345.0201118e201811  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061298252DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envint.2018.08.0142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Bin,1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8031-849410aAssociations of Salmonella hospitalizations with ambient temperature, humidity and rainfall in Hong Kong  ap. 223-230.  aLittle is known about the relationship between Salmonella infection and meteorological parameters other than air temperature. This study aimed to explore associations of Salmonella hospitalizations with temperature, relative humidity (RH) and rainfall.With negative binomial distribution assumed, time-series regression model adjusting for season and time trend were constructed employing distributed lag non-linear models and generalized additive models. Meteorological variables including mean temperature, RH, and daily total rainfall as well as indicator variables including day of the week and public holiday were incorporated in the models.Higher temperature was strongly associated with more hospitalizations over the entire range of temperatures observed. There was a net 6.13 (95%Confidence Interval (CI) 3.52–10.67) relative risk of hospitalization at a temperature of 30.5 °C, relative to 13 °C, lag 0–16 days. Positive associations were found for RH above 60% and rainfall between 0 and 0.14 mm. Extreme high humidity (96%) and trace rainfall (0.02 mm) were associated with 2.06 (95%CI 1.35–3.14), lag 0–17 day, and 1.30 (95%CI 1.01–1.67), lag 0–26 days, relative risks of hospitalizations, relative to 60% and no rain, respectively.High temperatures, high RH and light rainfall are positively associated with Salmonella hospitalizations. The very strong association with temperatures implies that hotter days will lead to increases in Salmonella morbidity in the absence of other changes, and the public health implications of this could be exacerbated by global climate change.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSalmonella 3aair temperature 3aambient temperature 3abinomial distribution 3aclimate change 3amorbidity 3anonlinear models 3apublic health 3arain 3aregression analysis 3arelative humidity 3arelative risk 3asalmonellosis 3atime series analysis 3aChina 0aSalmonella 0aTemperature 0aHumidity 0aRainfall 0aWeather 0aMeteorology1 aGoggins, William B.1 aChan, Emily Y.Y.0 tEnvironment international.g2018 Nov., v. 120 p.223-230dElsevier LtdwJournal:6374x0160-41207nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envint.2018.08.0143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01747naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001500145245008700160300001800247520056100265592002800826650001600854650001100870650002200881650001700903700005600920700002100976700002100997700001701018700002401035700006401059700005301123773013301176856007901309852000901388655001201397IND60726486920220413000000.0210205e20210107xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072648692DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.joc.0c020522doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCao, Yirui10aElectron-Deficient Polycyclic π-System Fused with Multiple B←N Coordinate Bonds  ap. 2100-2106.  aAn extensive polycyclic π-system with 23 fused rings is synthesized via a highly efficient borylation reaction, in which four B–N covalent bonds and four B←N coordinate bonds are formed in one pot.

The technique requires adequate training before it can be used safely and routinely. A novel anaesthesia induction chamber has been developed to simplify the treatment and to facilitate IV injection in mice, particularly for untrained personnel. We have assessed the benefits of the chamber in refining IV injection in isoflurane-anaesthetized mice in direct comparison with the common restrainer method on conscious animals. The body weight, nesting behaviour and concentrations of faecal corticosterone metabolites were taken as indicative of distress induced by the various procedures. The results suggest that both methods of tail-vein injection induce similar levels of momentary stress in the animals, revealed by a short-term increase in the levels of stress hormone metabolites in faeces. A temporary reduction of body weight was observed after IV injection under isoflurane anaesthesia but not for conscious mice injected in the common restrainer. We conclude that the severity of tail-vein injection in mice is ‘mild’ for both methods. There was no evidence that refining the procedure by using isoflurane anaesthesia in the induction chamber was associated with any benefit.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanesthesia 3abody weight 3acaudal vein 3acorticosterone 3adistress 3afeces 3aintravenous injection 3aisoflurane 3alaboratory animals 3ametabolites 3amice 3anesting 3arefining 0aintravenous injection 0amice 0aisoflurane anaesthesia 0ainduction chamber 0arestrainer1 aNeels, Tania1 aTichy, Alexander1 aPalme, Rupert1 aRülicke, Thomas,1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2121-94960 tLaboratory animals.g2019 Apr., v. 53, no. 2 p.190-201dSAGE PublicationswJournal:jnl45492x1758-11177nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/00236772187869823Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02930naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001700140245007600157300001400233500002900247520188200276592002802158650001402186650002002200650002202220650001002242650001302252650002202265650001802287650001602305650001302321700001702334700001502351773011902366856007402485852000902559655001202568IND60722537920221116145115.0210105e199703  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072253792DNAL7 a10.1186/BF035485062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKoskinen, E.10aEffect of 19-Norandrostenololylaurate on Semen Characteristics of Colts  ap. 41-50.  aNALT-AP-4-rerunAP2-fuzzy  aThe long-term effects of the anabolic steroid 19-norandrostenololylaurate on semen characteristics of Finnhorse colts were studied in 3 experiments. Semen was collected initially at 24 months of age and then twice a year. In experiment I, 500 mg or 100 mg of steroid per animal was given every 3rd week from 12 or 16 months to 24 months of age. In colts treated with 500 mg of anabolic steroid every 3rd week, azoospermia was observed in 3 out of 5 colts in the first semen collections, immediately after the end of treatment. The other 2 colts had low sperm numbers and a high percentage of proximal droplets in relation to control animals. The 100 mg group was less affected by steroid treatment than the 500 mg group. The seminal changes were observed to be reversible. All of the colts had spermatozoa in their ejaculates 4 months after the end of treatment. Two years after cessation of treatment, sperm numbers in treated animals exceeded those in the control group.In experiment II, colts were treated from 7 months to 12 months of age with a dose of 1 mg/kg every 3rd week or 0.3 mg/kg every week. The first semen collections took place 12 months after the last treatment. The animals treated with 0.3 mg/kg every week were less affected than those treated with 1 mg/kg every 3rd week.In experiment III, animals were treated from 3 months to 8 months of age, and the interval from the last treatment to the first semen collection was 16 months. There were no significant differences between the groups in any of the semen parameters examined. In the last semen collection, the control animals had numerically higher spermatozoal concentration and progressive motility and less dead sperm than the treated animals. It was concluded that the adverse effects of steroid treatment on semen characteristics were reversible, at least in the groups treated at age 7-25 months.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFinnhorse 3aadverse effects 3aanabolic steroids 3acolts 3adroplets 3along term effects 3asemen quality 3aspermatozoa 3asteroids1 aMarttila, P.1 aKatila, T.0 tActa veterinaria scandinavica.g1997 Mar., v. 38, no. 1 p.41-50dBioMed CentralwJournal:jnl16962x1751-01477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1186/BF035485063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02139naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002200149245010500171500001900276520104200295592002801337650001601365650002501381650000901406650000801415650001401423650001601437650002301453650001001476700003101486700002001517700002701537773013301564856008301697852000901780655001201789IND60735020420221119031243.0210423e20210416xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073502042DNAL7 a10.3390/agriculture110403652doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCzyż, Katarzyna 13aAn Attempt to Enrich Pig Meat with Omega-3 Fatty Acids Using Linseed Oil Ethyl Ester Diet Supplement  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThis study aims to evaluate an effect of pig diet supplementation with ethyl esters derived from linseed oil with a high content of alpha-linolenic acid (ALA) on the fatty acids profile of meat. The study was conducted on Polish Landrace fatteners supplemented for a period of 7 weeks (control and experimental groups of 8 animals each, 16 in total). After this period, loin (Longissimus dorsi) and ham (Biceps femoris) samples were collected for laboratory analysis, including basic composition (fat, protein, ash, dry matter) and fatty acids (FAs) profile. The supplementation caused a significant increase in the level of ALA acid, decrease in the content of saturated fatty acids (SFAs), increase in unsaturated FAs level, and resulting decrease in the ratio of n-6/n-3. The indices of atherogenicity and thrombogenicity were beneficially altered in the experimental groups. It can thus be supposed that meat enriched this way may be considered as an interesting choice for consumers who are aware of the importance of diet consumed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagriculture 3aalpha-linolenic acid 3adiet 3aham 3alandraces 3alinseed oil 3alongissimus muscle 3aswine1 aSokoła-Wysoczańska, Ewa 1 aWyrostek, Anna 1 aCholewińska, Paulina 0 tAgriculture (Basel).g2021 Apr. 16, v. 11, no. 4dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:12387x2077-04727nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agriculture110403653Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04407naa a2200649 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003100113040001800144100001800162245010400180300001800284520261200302592002802914650001302942650001802955650001202973650002402985650001703009650001403026650001203040650001003052650001203062650001003074650001403084650001503098650001203113650000903125650001103134650001103145650001603156650001203172650003303184650002303217650004203240650001103282650000903293650001403302650002403316651001103340651001103351653002503362653002703387653000803414653001003422700001403432700001603446700001503462700001303477700001603490773015203506856007803658852000903736655001203745IND60083470420221120113344.0190215e201305  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008347042DNAL7 a234778192pmid7 a10.3168/jds.2012-60102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRaboisson, D.10aPerinatal, neonatal, and rearing period mortality of dairy calves and replacement heifers in France  ap. 2913-2924.  aDairy calf and replacement heifer mortality in France was assessed by calculating mortality rates at 0 to 2d (calves), 3d to 1mo (calves and heifers), 1 to 6mo of age, and 6mo of age to first calving (heifers) using the national identification database. Between birth and 2-d-old, 261,000 and 251,000 of the 3.56 and 3.43 million calves born in 2005 and 2006, respectively, died. The overall 0- to 2-d-old calf mortality rate was around 6.7%, which is similar to the low range of values reported in the literature. Among the 2.38 and 2.39 million calf-month, 139,000 and 133,000 died between 3d and 1mo of age in 2005 and 2006, respectively. Among the 3d to 1 m of age group, dairy calf mortality rate was around 5.7%. Such a rate has not been reported previously because of the great differences in age classes between studies. For the 0- to 2-d-old and 3-d- to 1-mo-old calves, annual mortality was zero on 26 and 44% of the farms, respectively. Calf mortality during the first month of life increased in winter (to 12–17%) and decreased in summer (to 8–12%), with a small peak in June or July. Mortality during the first month of life is higher in males than in females, with a mortality odds ratio of 1.20 (and 95% confidence interval of 1.19–1.21). Such a difference is also found within the noncrossed or beef-crossed calf subpopulations. Disregarding the sex, the mortality of beef-crossed calves is slightly less than that of noncrossed dairy calves, with a mortality odds ratio of 0.98 (and 95% confidence interval of 0.98–0.99) before 1mo of age. In heifers, around 51,000, 35,000, and 40,900 out of the 1.2 million 3-d- to 1-mo-old, 1.1 million 1- to 6-mo-old, and 950,000 6-mo-old to first calving heifers died, respectively. The respective mortality rates were 4.5, 3.1, and 4.1%; these rates are similar to the low range of values previously published. The proportions of farms with no heifer mortality during a year were higher than for calves, between 60 and 70%. The mortality probability for heifers was very high for the first day of life (95% survival between 2–30d of age), then decreased during the first year of life and became constant up to around 3 yr of age (88% survival at 36mo of age). The risk of mortality is higher in Montbéliarde and Normande heifers compared with Holstein. In conclusion, and beyond the average mortality rates, farmers and farm advisors should keep in mind the broad range of mortality values, which shows that very low mortality (1–2%) can be achieved, even in animals with a known high risk of mortality, such as beef-crossed dairy calves.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHolstein 3aage structure 3acalving 3aconfidence interval 3adairy calves 3adatabases 3afarmers 3afarms 3aheifers 3amales 3amortality 3aodds ratio 3arearing 3arisk 3asummer 3awinter 2aAge Factors 2aAnimals 2aAnimals, Newbornxphysiology 2aCattlexphysiology 2aDairyingxstatistics & numerical data 2aFemale 2aMale 2aMortality 2aPerinatal Mortality 3aFrance 0aFrance 0adairy calf mortality 0adairy heifer mortality 0asex 0abreed1 aDelor, F.1 aCahuzac, E.1 aGendre, C.1 aSans, P.1 aAllaire, G.0 tJournal of dairy science.g2013 May, v. 96, no. 5 p.2913-2924dElsevier Inc.aAmerican Dairy Science AssociationwJournal:jnl45500x0022-03027nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3168/jds.2012-60103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01181naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001500140245005900155300001600214500001400230520025600244592002800500650002500528650002100553650001300574650002800587650001400615700001800629700001600647773012100663856007400784852000900858655001200867IND60722538020221116145157.0210105e199706  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072253802DNAL7 a10.1186/BF035485012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSukura, A.10aOccurrence of Pneumocystis carinii in Canine Distemper  ap. 201-205.  aNAL-light  aPneumocystis carinii is a eukaryotic opportunistic pathogen causing pneumonia (PCP) in immunosuppressed patients.

The ongoing naturalization of select Magnolia taxa has been associated with climate change and variously characterized as assisted-migration, range shift/expansion, or biological invasion. This study documented recruitment patterns in space and time for two species of introduced ‘umbrella’ magnolias, which have become increasingly prolific in New England. A census was conducted that identified a total of 388 Magnolia macrophylla (SE US.) and M. obovata (Japan) individuals that escaped from cultivation and colonized an adjacent oak forest. Seedling recruitment occurred rapidly in response to forest disturbance, and mean tree age was significantly different as a function of three discrete disturbance events. M. obovata was a more successful colonizer overall, yielding more individuals (326 vs. 62), and recruiting further (90% quantile = 388 ± 91 vs. 228 ± 44 m) than M. macrophylla, given founding populations that were of identical size (n = 3) and similar age. This study represents the first documented escape of M. obovata in North America, while M. macrophylla has been documented elsewhere in New England and linked to increased temperature and precipitation patterns.  aPublisher supplied data 3aJapan 3aMagnolia macrophylla 3aclimate change 3aecological invasion 3aforest damage 3aforests 3aspace and time 3aspecies recruitment 3atemperature 3atree age 3aNew England region 0adispersal location kernel 0aforest disturbance 0ahorticulture 0amagnolia 0arange shift0 tÉcoscience.g2020 July 02, v. 27, no. 3 p.165-176dTaylor & FranciswJournal:19715x2376-76267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/11956860.2020.17533113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02612naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001900145245006000164300001800224520132700242592002801569650001501597650001101612650002001623650001801643650002101661650001201682650002201694650001401716650002801730650001501758650002001773700002601793700002301819700002201842700005501864700006201919773013301981856007902114852000902193655001202202IND60726487320221118035034.0210205e20210115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072648732DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.joc.0c023332doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWilliams, Dean10ad-Glycero-β-d-mannoheptose Phosphate 7-O-Modifications  ap. 2184-2199.  aPathogen-associated molecular patterns activate the immune system via pattern recognition receptors. Recently, newly discovered pathogen-associated molecular patterns, d-glycero-β-d-mannoheptose phosphate and d-glycero-β-d-mannoheptose 1,7-biphosphate, were shown to induce a TRAF-interacting protein with a forkhead-associated domain-dependent immune response in human embryonic kidney cells and colonic epithelial cells. Concurrently, ADP-heptose was shown to bind α-kinase 1 and activate TIFA via phosphorylation leading to an immune cascade to ultimately activate NF-κB. These pathogen-associated molecular patterns have raised interest in the pharmaceutical industry for their potential use as immunomodulators. However, little is understood about the host cell uptake of d-glycero-β-d-mannoheptose phosphate, d-glycero-β-d-mannoheptose 1,7-biphosphate, and ADP-heptose in vivo and derivatives of these molecules are needed to interrogate this. In this regard, herein we describe 7-O-modifications of d-glycero-β-d-mannoheptose phosphate to produce molecular probes toward the development of a useful toolbox for biologists. A convergent strategy that involves introduction of a substituent at O-7 before alkene oxidation was investigated and proved successful in the generation of a range of molecular probes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aepithelium 3ahumans 3aimmune response 3aimmune system 3aimmunomodulators 3akidneys 3aorganic chemistry 3aoxidation 3apharmaceutical industry 3aphosphates 3aphosphorylation1 aJamshidi, Mohammad P.1 aSt. Michael, Frank1 aChisholm, Kenneth1 aCox, Andrew1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8397-92711 aSauvageau, Janelle1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7476-84240 tJournal of organic chemistry.g2021 Jan. 15, v. 86, no. 3 p.2184-2199dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19181x1520-69047nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.joc.0c023333Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04557naa a2200769 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003100113040001800144100001700162245010400179300001800283520234300301592002802644650002602672650001002698650002402708650001502732650001802747650001602765650002302781650001702804650001002821650001402831650001202845650001402857650001302871650001302884650000902897650002402906650003302930650001202963650001102975650003402986650001603020650004403036650001103080650003903091650003503130650003503165650003403200650001503234650001703249651001203266651001203278651001203290651001003302651001103312651001303323651001103336651001303347651001003360651002603370653001503396653002403411653002303435653002303458700002303481700001403504700001803518773015203536856007803688852000903766655001203775IND60083470520221120113238.0190215e201305  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008347052DNAL7 a234979972pmid7 a10.3168/jds.2012-60352doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSuthar, V.S.10aPrevalence of subclinical ketosis and relationships with postpartum diseases in European dairy cows  ap. 2925-2938.  aSubclinical ketosis (SCK) is defined as concentrations of β-hydroxybutyrate (BHBA) ≥1.2 to 1.4mmol/L and it is considered a gateway condition for other metabolic and infectious disorders such as metritis, mastitis, clinical ketosis, and displaced abomasum. Reported prevalence rates range from 6.9 to 43% in the first 2mo of lactation. However, there is a dearth of information on prevalence rates considering the diversity of European dairy farms. The objectives of this study were to (1) determine prevalence of SCK, (2) identify thresholds of BHBA, and (3) study their relationships with postpartum metritis, clinical ketosis, displaced abomasum, lameness, and mastitis in European dairy farms. From May to October 2011, a convenience sample of 528 dairy herds from Croatia, Germany, Hungary, Italy, Poland, Portugal, Serbia, Slovenia, Spain, and Turkey was studied. β-Hydroxybutyrate levels were measured in 5,884 cows with a handheld meter within 2 to 15 d in milk (DIM). On average, 11 cows were enrolled per farm and relevant information (e.g., DIM, postpartum diseases, herd size) was recorded. Using receiver operator characteristic curve analyses, blood BHBA thresholds were determined for the occurrence of metritis, mastitis, clinical ketosis, displaced abomasum, and lameness. Multivariate binary logistic regression models were built for each disease, considering cow as the experimental unit and herd as a random effect. Overall prevalence of SCK (i.e., blood BHBA ≥1.2mmol/L) within 10 countries was 21.8%, ranging from 11.2 to 36.6%. Cows with SCK had 1.5, 9.5, and 5.0 times greater odds of developing metritis, clinical ketosis, and displaced abomasum, respectively. Multivariate binary logistic regression models demonstrated that cows with blood BHBA levels of ≥1.4, ≥1.1 and ≥1.7mmol/L during 2 to 15 DIM had 1.7, 10.5, and 6.9 times greater odds of developing metritis, clinical ketosis, and displaced abomasum, respectively, compared with cows with lower BHBA blood levels. Interestingly, a postpartum blood BHBA threshold ≥1.1mmol/L increased the odds for lameness in dairy cows 1.8 (95% confidence interval: 1.3 to 2.5) times. Overall, prevalence of SCK was high between 2 to 15 DIM and SCK increased the odds of metritis, clinical ketosis, lameness, and displaced abomasum in European dairy herds.  aPublisher supplied data 3a3-hydroxybutyric acid 3ablood 3aconfidence interval 3adairy cows 3adairy farming 3adairy herds 3adisplaced abomasum 3aendometritis 3afarms 3aherd size 3aketosis 3alactation 3alameness 3amastitis 3amilk 3aregression analysis 2a3-Hydroxybutyric Acidxblood 2aAnimals 2aCattle 2aCattle Diseasesxepidemiology 2aComorbidity 2aEndometritisxepidemiologyxveterinary. 2aFemale 2aKetosisxepidemiologyxveterinary. 2aLameness, Animalxepidemiology 2aMastitis, Bovinexepidemiology 2aPostpartum Periodxphysiology 2aPrevalence 2aRisk Factors 3aCroatia 3aGermany 3aHungary 3aItaly 3aPoland 3aPortugal 3aSerbia 3aSlovenia 3aSpain 0aEuropexepidemiology. 0aprevalence 0asubclinical ketosis 0aβ-hydroxybutyrate 0apostpartum disease1 aCanelas-Raposo, J.1 aDeniz, A.1 aHeuwieser, W.0 tJournal of dairy science.g2013 May, v. 96, no. 5 p.2925-2938dElsevier Inc.aAmerican Dairy Science AssociationwJournal:jnl45500x0022-03027nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3168/jds.2012-60353Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03061naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245012200164300001800286520170700304592002802011650001902039650001802058650002202076650001002098650001702108650001202125650001102137650001402148651001002162653002802172653003002200653001802230653001002248653001902258653002702277700001802304700001302322700005202335700001702387773012002404856008202524852000902606655001202615IND60732965420221120102240.0220914e202107  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073296542DNAL7 a10.1016/j.spc.2021.03.0202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHan, Jingwei10aCan market-oriented reform inhibit carbon dioxide emissions in China?

The high wages caused by the insufficient supply of labor and the low marginal output of labor due to the shortage of human capital stock are the main reason for the positive labor market distortion. The capital market distortion can be put down to the excessive interventions of the government on the allocation of capital. (2) The labor market distortion can enhance CO₂ emissions, that is, promoting market-oriented reform in the labor market can curb CO₂ emissions. (3) The connection between capital market distortion and CO₂ emissions can be described as a U-shaped curve. The complete marketization of the capital market and excessive government intervention in the allocation of capital can both cause an increase in CO₂ emissions. (4) Improving the marketization of the labor market is effective for reducing CO₂ emissions in almost all provinces. In the central region, the capital market distortion can exacerbate CO₂ emissions. However, in the western region, the governmental intervention on the allocation of capital can enable limited funds to more effectively move to environmentally friendly enterprises, and avoid these provinces becoming a pollution refuge. Based on these findings, this article goes into more detail on the policy implications.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon dioxide 3ahuman capital 3aissues and policy 3alabor 3alabor market 3amarkets 3amodels 3apollution 3aChina 0alabor market distortion 0acapital market distortion 0aCO2 emissions 0aChina 0aU-shaped curve 0amarket-oriented reform1 aMiao, Jianjun1 aDu, Gang1 aYan, Dan1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1219-96461 aMiao, Zhuang0 tSustainable Production and Consumption.g2021 July, v. 27 p.1498-1513dElsevier LtdwJournal:23261x2352-55097nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.spc.2021.03.0203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03311naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001600153245013400169300001600303520157200319592002801891650002101919650001101940650001401951650001301965650002301978650001502001650002102016650002202037650001902059650001102078650001302089650002502102650001402127650001102141650002002152650001702172653004002189653003702229653002402266653002002290653003002310653002402340700001802364700001602382700001402398700001702412700001702429700006602446700001802512773011802530856008802648852000902736655001202745IND60634791020221119112625.0190404e20190520xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063479102DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.02.3002doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYe, Wenyuan10aHierarchically structured carbon materials derived from lotus leaves as efficient electrocatalyst for microbial energy harvesting  ap. 865-874.  aDeveloping a highly efficient, cost-effective, easily scalable and sustainable cathode for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is a crucial challenge in terms of future “green” energy conversion technologies, e.g., microbial fuel cells (MFCs). In this study, a natural and widely available lotus leaf with intrinsically hierarchical structure was employed to serve as the single precursor to prepare the catalyst applied as the MFC cathode. The hierarchically particle-coated bio‑carbon was self-constructed from the lotus leaf, which yielded a large specific surface area, highly porous structure and superhydrophobicity via facile pyrolysis coupling hydrothermal activation by ZnCl2/(NH4)2SO4. Electrochemical evaluation demonstrated that these natural leaf-derived carbons have an efficient ORR activity. Specifically, the HC-900 catalyst with hydrothermal activation achieved an onset potential of −0.015 V vs. Ag/AgCl, which was comparable to the commercial Pt/C catalyst (−0.010 V vs. Ag/AgCl) and was more efficient than the DC-900 catalyst through direct pyrolysis. Furthermore, the HC-900 catalyst achieved an outstanding ORR activity via a one-step and four-electron pathway, exhibiting a potential alternative to Pt/C as electrocatalyst in ORR, due to its better long-term durability and methanol resistance. Additionally, the HC-900 catalyst was applied as an effective electrocatalytic cathode in an MFC system with a maximum power density of 511.5 ± 25.6 mW⋅m−2, exhibiting a superior energy harvesting capacity to the Pt/C cathode.  aPublisher supplied data 3aammonium sulfate 3acarbon 3acatalysts 3acathodes 3acost effectiveness 3adurability 3aelectrochemistry 3aenergy conversion 3ahydrophobicity 3aleaves 3amethanol 3amicrobial fuel cells 3apyrolysis 3asilver 3asilver chloride 3asurface area 0aLotus leaf-derived carbon materials 0aHierarchical micro/nanostructure 0aSuperhydrophobicity 0aElectrocatalyst 0aOxygen reduction reaction 0aMicrobial fuel cell1 aTang, Jiahuan1 aWang, Yajun1 aCai, Xixi1 aLiu, Hongwei1 aLin, Jiuyang1 aBruggen, Bart van der,1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3921-74721 aZhou, Shungui0 tScience of the total environment.g2019 May 20, v. 666 p.865-874dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.02.3003Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02431naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003600113040001800149100002200167245014400189300001200333520107400345592002801419650002201447650001501469650001201484650001301496650001201509650002501521650003601546650004101582650005101623650001101674650002301685650003001708650006101738650003601799700001901835773007601854856008201930852000902012655001202021IND60098955520221120052015.0141105e20120510xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009895552DNAL7 a223872052pmid7 a10.1016/j.gene.2012.02.0152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKurimchak, Alison10aPP2A holoenzymes negatively and positively regulate cell cycle progression by dephosphorylating pocket proteins and multiple CDK substrates  ap. 1-7.  aCell cycle progression is negatively regulated by the retinoblastoma family of pocket proteins and CDK inhibitors (CKIs). In contrast, CDKs promote progression through multiple phases of the cell cycle. One prominent way by which CDKs promote cell cycle progression is by inactivation of pocket proteins via hyperphosphorylation. Reactivation of pocket proteins to halt cell cycle progression requires dephosphorylation of multiple CDK-phosphorylated sites and is accomplished by PP2A and PP1 serine/threonine protein phosphatases. The same phosphatases are also implicated in dephosphorylation of multiple CDK substrates as cells exit mitosis and reenter the G1 phase of the cell cycle. This review is primarily focused on the role of PP2A and PP1 in the activation of pocket proteins during the cell cycle and in response to signaling cues that trigger cell cycle exit. Other functions of PP2A during the cell cycle will be discussed in brief, as comprehensive reviews on this topic have been published recently (De Wulf et al., 2009; Wurzenberger and Gerlich, 2011).  aPublisher supplied data 3adephosphorylation 3ainterphase 3amitosis 3aproteins 2aAnimals 2aCell Cyclexgenetics 2aCell Cycle Proteinsxmetabolism 2aCyclin-Dependent Kinasesxmetabolism 2aHoloenzymesxgeneticsxmetabolismxphysiology. 2aHumans 2aModels, Biological 2aPhosphorylationxgenetics 2aProtein Phosphatase 2xgeneticsxmetabolismxphysiology. 2aSubstrate Specificityxgenetics1 aGraña, Xavier0 tGene.g2012 May 10, v. 499, no. 1 p.1-7dElsevier B.V.x0378-11197nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gene.2012.02.0153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01633naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002400149245013300173300001600306520049800322592002800820650001900848650001600867650001600883650001300899650001400912650002300926650002300949650001300972700001900985700003101004700002201035700001701057773010301074856008501177852000901262655001201271IND60579233520180316000000.0170816e20160219xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057923352DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.orglett.5b034992doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBernárdez, Rodrigo10aTandem Long Distance Chain-Walking/Cyclization via RuH2(CO)(PPh3)3/Brønsted Acid Catalysis: Entry to Aromatic Oxazaheterocycles  ap. 642-645.  aA novel route to 1,3-oxazaheterocycles based on cooperative Ru–H/Brønsted acid catalysis is reported.

Polyethyleneimine-coated magnetite (PEIMnF) and nickel ferrite (PEINF) nanoparticles were succesfully synthesized and their surface groups, morphology and chemical structures were characterized using ATR-FTIR (Attenuated Total Reflectance Fourrier Transformed Infra-Red) and SEM (Scanning Electron Microscopy). TGA (Thermogravimetric analysis) was used to analyse the thermal behaviour and stability of synthesized nanomaterials. The minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) values of the polyethylene imine coated magnetite and nickel ferrite nanomaterials against Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli and Candida albicans was found to be 10 mg/mL. Both nanomaterials (PEIMnF and PEINF) showed very excellent and concentration-dependent biofilm inhibition especially at the highest test concentration of 10 mg/mL at which PEIMnF inhibited biofilm formation on E. coli (89.04 ± 0.50%), S. aureus (82.85 ± 2.42%) and C. albicans (91.37 ± 0.66%). At this concentration, PEINF equally inhibited biofilm formations of E. coli (90.48 ± 2.05%), S. aureus (87.04 ± 1.59%) and C. albicans (90.94 ± 1.03%). Only PEINF showed a concentration-dependent violacein inhibition with highest inhibition of 51.2 ± 3.5% at MIC and quorum sensing with inhibition zones of 16.3 ± 1.0 mm at MIC and 11.5 ± 0.5 mm at MIC/2 which could be attributed to the presence of nickel. The nanomaterials inhibited swimming and swarming motilities in Pseudomonas aeruginosa PA01 and it was found that at the same concentration, swimming inhibition was greater than swarming inhibitions and PEINF showed better inhibition than PEIMnF in both models. Polyethyleneimine-coated magnetite and nickel ferrite nanomaterials could be used in overcoming health problems associated with microbial infections and resistance.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCandida albicans 3aEscherichia coli 3aPseudomonas aeruginosa 3aStaphylococcus aureus 3abiofilm 3aferrimagnetic materials 3aimines 3amagnetism 3amagnetite 3aminimum inhibitory concentration 3anickel 3apolyethylene 3areflectance 3athermal properties 3athermogravimetry 3aviolacein1 aTamfu, Alfred Ngenge1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6683-33371 aDoğaç, Yasemin İspirli1 aTeke, Mustafa0 t3 Biotech.g2020 Dec., v. 10, no. 12 p.513-513dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:22884x2190-572X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13205-020-02509-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03031naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100002000154245011500174300001400289520187900303592002802182650002502210650002202235650000902257650000902266650001402275650001602289653001402305653002002319653002602339653002802365653002002393653001802413700002402431773010302455856009002558852000902648655001202657IND60569467720221122224821.0170530e201703  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056946772DNAL7 a10.1655/HERPETOLOGICA-D-15-000382doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWise, Taylor B.10aSide-necked Versus Hidden-necked: A Comparison of Shell Morphology Between Pleurodiran and Cryptodiran Turtles  ap. 18-29.  aThis study explores the potential morphological differences between pleurodiran and cryptodiran turtle shells. Pleurodires (Suborder Pleurodira), as suggested by their name, retract their heads into the shell by bending the neck to the side; this is different from cryptodires (Suborder Cryptodira), which withdraw their necks along a sagittal plane. Pleurodires also have evolved a unique pelvic morphology typified by two columnar pelvic elements sutured to both the carapace and plastron; in contrast, the pelvic girdle in cryptodires is loosely connected to the shell. These differences might put very different selective pressures on shell shape in these animals: The different head retraction strategies in the two groups could lead pleurodires to evolve wider and flatter anterior apertures while the differences in pelvic structure might permit the evolution of flatter carapaces (particularly in the posterior carapace) and narrower bridges as compared to cryptodires. We used 3D landmark data to characterize shell shape and used phylomorphospace plots to examine patterns of diversification within pleurodires. We also used analyses of variance to examine morphological differences between the shell shapes of cryptodire and pleurodire turtles. We found significant phylogenetic signal in pleurodire shell shape. Clustering of pleurodires in shape space primarily followed phylogeny, with all major clades occupying distinct regions of shell shape space. Pleurodires overlapped most strongly in shell shape with aquatic cryptodires, both swimmers (including sea turtles) and bottom-walkers (such as chelydrids). Future studies could seek additional support for the hypotheses, through mechanical tests of shell performance, that the mechanism of neck retraction or the presence of columnar pelvic girdles can influence the functional performance of turtle shells.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanalysis of variance 3aanimal morphology 3ahead 3aneck 3aphylogeny 3asea turtles 0aAllometry 0aDiversification 0aFunctional morphology 0aGeometric morphometrics 0aHead retraction 0aPelvic girdle1 aStayton, C.

Typical microbatteries commonly use thin-film inorganic electrodes based on Li-ion insertion reaction. However, they rely on the complicated thin-film synthesis method of inorganics containing many elements. Graphene, one atomic layer thick carbon sheet, has diverse physical and chemical properties and is compatible with conventional micron-scale device fabrication. Here, we study the use of chemical vapor deposition (CVD) grown monolayer graphene in a two-dimensional configuration, as a future Li–oxygen microbattery cathode. By maximizing the dissolution of discharge intermediates, we obtain 2610 Ah/ggᵣₐₚₕₑₙₑ of capacity corresponding to 20% higher areal cathode energy density and 2.7 times higher cathode specific energy than that can be derived from the same volume or mass of conventional Li-ion battery cathode material. Furthermore, a clear observation on the discharge reaction on composite electrodes and their role in the charging reaction was made, thanks to the two-dimensional monolayer graphene Li–oxygen battery cathode. We demonstrate an easy integration of two-dimensional CVD graphene cathode into microscale devices by simply transferring or coating the target device substrate with flexible graphene layers. The ability to integrate and use monolayer graphene on arbitrary device substrates as well as precise control over a chemical derivation of the carbon interface can have a radical impact on future energy-storage devices.  aPublisher supplied data 3acathodes 3achemical reactions 3acoatings 3aelectronics 3aenergy 3agraphene 3alithium batteries 3aspecific energy 3avapors 0amicrobatteries 0aLi−oxygen batteries 0agraphene 0amicrofabrication 0athin-film batteries1 aLara, Erik1 aArellano, Noel1 aShin, Yong Cheol1 aMedina, Phillip1 aKim, Jangwoo1 aTa, Toan1 aAkca, Esin1 aOzgit-Akgun, Cagla1 aDemirci, Gökhan1 aKim, Ho-cheol1 aHan, Shu-jen1 aMaune, Hareem1 aSamant, Mahesh G.0 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2018 Dec. 07, v. 11, no. 1 p.489-498dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.8b127183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01691naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002000149245009600169300001600265520065000281592002800931650001400959650002300973650002300996650002501019650001101044650001701055700002401072700002001096700002001116700002001136773010301156856008501259852000901344655001201353IND60579233720221118043417.0170816e20160219xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057923372DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.orglett.5b035392doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSekikawa, Tohru10aAnti-Selective Asymmetric Nitro-Michael Reaction of Furanones: Diastereocontrol by Catalyst  ap. 646-649.  aCatalyst-controlled switching of diastereoselectivity from high syn-selectivity (>98/2 dr, syn) to anti-selectivity (up to 96/4 dr, anti) of the asymmetric nitro-Michael reaction of furanones is described. Anti-diastereoselectivity of the nitro-Michael reaction is very rare. With 0.1–5 mol % loadings of an epi-quinine catalyst, the reaction of 5-substituted 2(3H)-furanones with nitroalkenes smoothly proceeded to give the anti-Michael adducts in good yields (up to 95%) with excellent diastereo- and enantioselectivities (up to 96/4 dr, anti; up to 99% ee).

However, the synthesized perovskite lasers are usually randomly distributed on the substrate, making their laser emissions hard to be collected and utilized. Here we demonstrate a simple way to efficiently couple perovskite microlasers into conventional single mode fibers. By attaching a perovskite microwire onto a tapered fiber via micromanipulation, we found that the emissions along the single mode fiber are more than an order of magnitude larger than the collected emission with a 40× objective lens (NA = 0.6). The detailed estimation shows that the experimentally measured collection efficiency at one end of the tapered fiber can be around 13–20%, which is good enough for practical applications. Our numerical calculations show that the collection is mainly induced by the diffraction at the end of the microwire instead of the evanescent coupling and the total coefficient at the two ends can be further improved by optimizing the tapered fiber and microwire. As the tapered fiber is drawn from a commercial single-mode fiber, this research clearly shows the potential of perovskite devices to be integrated with conventional fiber systems.  aPublisher supplied data 3aemissions 3alasers 3asemiconductors 3awavelengths1 aSun, Wenzhao1 aWang, Kaiyang1 aZhang, Nan1 aZhang, Chen1 aLyu, Quan1 aLi, Jiankai1 aXiao, Shumin1 aSong, Qinghai0 tJournal of materials chemistry A.g2016 May 24, v. 4, no. 21 p.8015-8019dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26903x2050-74967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c6ta01620k3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03026naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100002000154245012500174300001200299520137400311592002801685650001801713650002201731650001601753650002101769650001501790650001201805650001401817650001301831650001501844650001501859650000901874650002601883650001201909650002301921653001601944653001401960653002901974653001502003653001502018653002402033700002302057700002002080700002002100700003002120700001902150700002602169700002202195700001902217700002402236773010102260856009002361852000902451655001202460IND60569467920221122224958.0170530e201703  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056946792DNAL7 a10.1655/Herpetologica-D-15-000722doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTrochet, Audrey10aPostbreeding Movements in Marbled Newts (Caudata, Salamandridae): A Comparative Radiotracking Study in Two Habitat Types  ap. 1-9.  aThe maintenance of gene flow and colonization of new areas are influenced by an organism's movements in the landscape. Movement favors genetic mixing and limits inbreeding risk, hence decreasing the risk of extinction. Movement is a multifactorial process, however, and might be influenced by both individual traits and environmental factors. Studying the influence of individual characteristics and landscape features on movement is becoming an important challenge in evolutionary ecology and conservation biology, especially among threatened species such as amphibians. In a low-disperser species (Triturus marmoratus), we expected differences in movement ability to vary with individual traits, such as body length, as well as features of the landscape. On the basis of radiotracking surveys in both forests and agricultural lands, we revealed that landscape features and climatic conditions influenced the distances traveled by newts. Moreover, the individual traits, and particularly the body length and the hind-limb length, were also important factors explaining movement patterns in Marbled Newts. Highlighting such movement-related traits in a salamander species could improve estimates of movement potential based on morphological traits. Our results can assist in recommendations for conservation plans of the Marbled Newts, and more generally of amphibians.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSalamandridae 3aagricultural land 3abody length 3aclimatic factors 3aextinction 3aforests 3agene flow 3ahabitats 3ainbreeding 3alandscapes 3arisk 3asalamanders and newts 3asurveys 3athreatened species 0aBody length 0aDispersal 0aHeterogeneous landscapes 0aLeg length 0aMorphology 0aTriturus marmoratus1 aLe Chevalier, Hugo1 aCalvez, Olivier1 aBarthe, Laurent1 aIsselin-Nondedeu, Francis1 aPicard, Damien1 aDebelgarric, Mélanie1 aPégourié, Ninon1 aRocher, Rozenn1 aRibéron, Alexandre0 tHerpetologica.g2017 Mar., v. 73, no. 1 p.1-9dThe Herpetologists' League, Inc.x1938-50997nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1655%2FHerpetologica-D-15-000723Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04390naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006000148245015600208300001200364500001900376520285100395592002803246650002803274650001603302650002003318650002003338650002503358650001703383650001903400650003103419650001803450650000903468650001103477650001903488650002003507650002603527650001703553650002003570700002203590700001803612700002003630700002203650700002603672773011803698856008303816852000903899655001203908IND60717189220221120212554.0201204e202012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071718922DNAL7 a10.1007/s13205-020-02511-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPatel, Ankita A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5084-249010aTranscriptome analysis for molecular landscaping of genes controlling diterpene andrographolide biosynthesis in Andrographis paniculata (Burm. f.) Nees  ap. 512.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aKalmegh [Andrographis paniculata (Burm. f.) Nees.] is one of the essential medicinal plants due to an important terpenoid, i.e. andrographolide possesses immense therapeutic and pharmacological uses. The experiment was performed to elucidate the expression of candidate genes associated with andrographolide biosynthesis. Based on results obtained in chromatography for andrographolide content analysis of six genotypes, two contrast genotypes, i.e. IC-520361 (maximum andrographolide content—2.33%) and Anand Local (lowest andrographolide content—1.01%) were selected for the transcriptome analysis. A total of 1.04 Gb of raw data were produced using MiSeq Illumina platform, in which IC 520361 generated 645 million base pairs sequence along with 4,524,251 raw reads and Anand Local produced 419 million base pairs sequence along with 3,021,316 raw reads. The combined assembly of high quality reads generated for both the samples had 33,247,454 bp of total assembled bases and 38,292 of transcripts. The GC percent of assembled transcripts was 44.79%, an average read length was 800 bp and N₅₀ value was 1186 bp. Species-specific distribution using BLAST X (Nr), showed the highest Blast hits with Sesamum indicum. Out of 23,346 transcripts, 87% of transcripts annotated in UniProt KB (Universal Protein Resource KnowledgeBase) database and only 0.21% of transcripts were annotated in TAIR (The Arabidopsis Information Resources). Biological processes gene ontology classified based on Blast2GO showed, out of 6853 transcripts, 1370 of transcripts were represented by terpenoid biosynthetic pathway, which involved in secondary metabolite andrographolide biosynthesis. The heat map showed 1016 transcripts were differentially expressed between two kalmegh genotypes, in which nine important differentially expressed transcripts related to MEP (2C methyl-D-erythritol 4-phosphate) and MVA (Mevalonic acid) andrographolide biosynthesis pathways such as, geranyl diphosphate synthase small subunit, Isopentenyl-diphosphate delta-isomerase i-like, 4, 13-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme a reductase etc. were upregulated in IC 520361 as compared to Anand Local, which were validated through RT-qPCR. The highest expression of gene 13-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme a reductase (HMGR) was reported, which is responsible for accumulation of andrographolide in leaf. This comparative transcriptome analysis confirmed the expression level of genes were higher in accession IC 520361 as compare to Anand Local related to andrographolide biosynthesis pathways i.e. MEP and MVA. These up-regulated genes could be over-expressed to enhance the andrographolide content using genetic engineering of these metabolic pathways. It will also give an idea to the breeder for development of molecular markers for direct screening of the genotypes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAndrographis paniculata 3aArabidopsis 3aSesamum indicum 3aandrographolide 3abiochemical pathways 3abiosynthesis 3achromatography 3agene expression regulation 3agene ontology 3aheat 3aleaves 3amevalonic acid 3aoxidoreductases 3asecondary metabolites 3atherapeutics 3atranscriptomics1 aShukla, Yogesh M.1 aKumar, Sushil1 aSakure, Amar A.1 aParekh, Mithil J.1 aZala, Harshvardhan N.0 t3 Biotech.g2020 Dec., v. 10, no. 12 p.512-512dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:22884x2190-572X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13205-020-02511-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02603naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001400146245006400160300001600224520123500240592002801475650001301503650001601516650001001532650000901542650001801551650000901569650001901578650001001597650001501607650001101622650002601633650001701659650001001676650000901686650001901695651001101714653001901725653001501744653001301759700001601772700001901788700002101807700001701828700001801845700002201863773010901885856008201994852000902076655001202085IND60479878920221119204404.0160123e20090301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6047987892DNAL7 a10.1556/CRC.37.2009.1.142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPurar, B.10aCorn reddening: Occurrence, symptoms and field observations  ap. 121-129.  aCorn reddening (CR) was observed for the first time in Serbia in 1957. After that, it occurred periodically, mainly in the region of Banat. In 2002 and 2003, a severe outbreak happened in late July / early August. Initial symptoms were the occurrence of a red-violet color on the leaves, leaf sheaths, husks and the bare portion of internodes. The symptoms typically appeared at the milk maturity stage and the discoloration was the most intensive at top leaves, around the main vein and along the edges, from leaf base to tip. Soon after the occurrence of the symptoms, the affected plants wilted, the foliage dried rapidly, the red pigmentation disappeared for a greater part and finally plant died off. The ears were underdeveloped and gummous and kernels were shriveled and unfilled.Several experiments were conducted to determine a possible connection between CR occurrence and the studied factors. Corn stunt spiroplasma was not identified in the CR-affected plants, and there was no apparent relationship between CR and soil fertility or nematode species identified in soil and plant samples. Insecticide-treated plots had lower CR incidence than untreated (control) plots, indicating that biotic factors could be involved.  aPublisher supplied data 3aNematoda 3aSpiroplasma 3acolor 3acorn 3adiscoloration 3aears 3afilling period 3ahulls 3ainternodes 3aleaves 3apesticide application 3apigmentation 3aseeds 3asoil 3asoil fertility 3aSerbia 0acorn reddening 0aoccurrence 0asymptoms1 aBekavac, G.1 aJocković, Đ.1 aToldi Tóth, É.1 aKálmán, L.1 aRaspudić, E.1 aDimitrijević, M.0 tCereal research communications.g2009 Mar. 1, v. 37, no. 1 p.121-129dAkadémiai Kiadóx0133-37207nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1556%2FCRC.37.2009.1.143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03018naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002100148245007100169300001600240500001900256500001100275520152500286592002801811650001901839650002401858650002001882650002201902650002101924650001801945650001301963650001401976650001401990650001402004650002002018650002302038650003102061650001302092650001802105650002702123650001602150650001002166650002002176650002102196651001502217700006102232773012802293856008202421852000902503655001202512IND60717189520221120212506.0201109e202012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071718952DNAL7 a10.1007/s13659-020-00269-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aUddin, Md.

The SOD2 gene presents the 47C>T single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP; ID: rs4880) which produces MnSOD with different activities. The −9Val MnSOD (47T allele) is less efficient than the −9Ala version (47C allele). During sepsis there are abundance of ROS, high SOD2 expression and excess of H2O2 synthesis. High concentrations of H2O2 could affect the sepsis scenario and/or the sepsis outcome.We determined the 47C>T single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) frequencies in 529 critically ill patients with or without sepsis, facing outcome. To collect information on population frequencies, we obtained a pilot 47C>T genotypic and allelic frequencies in a random group of 139 healthy subjects.We compared the 47C allele carriers (47CC+47CT genotypes) with 47TT homozygotes and noticed a significant association between 47C allele carriers and septic shock in septic patients (P=0.025). With an adjusted binary multivariate logistic regression, incorporating 47C>T SNP and the main clinical predictors, we showed high SOFA scores [P<0.001, OR=9.107 (95% CI=5.319–15.592)] and 47C allele [P=0.011, OR=2.125 (95% CI=1.190–3.794)] were significantly associated with septic shock outcome. With this information we presented a hypothesis suggesting that this negative outcome from sepsis is possibly explained by effects on cellular stress caused by 47C allele.In our population there was a significant higher frequency of septic shock in septic patients with the 47C allele of the SOD2 gene. This higher 47C allele frequency in septic patients with negative outcome could be explained by effects of higher activity MnSOD on cellular stress during the sepsis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalleles 3agene frequency 3ahomozygosity 3ahydrogen peroxide 3apatients 3aregression analysis 3aseptic shock 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism 3asuperoxide dismutase 2aCase-Control Studies 2aCritical Illness 2aFemale 2aFollow-Up Studies 2aGene Frequency 2aGenotype 2aHumans 2aMale 2aMiddle Aged 2aOxidative Stressxgenetics 2aPolymorphism, Single Nucleotidexgenetics 2aPrognosis 2aRetrospective Studies 2aShock, Septicxgenetics 2aSuperoxide Dismutasexgenetics 0a47C 0a47C>T 0a47T 0a47TT 0a47CC 0aAla 0aAla-9Val 0aAPACHE-II 0aCAT 0aeNOS 0aGPx 0aH2O2 0aHSL 0aICU 0aIL 0aLOS 0aLPS 0aMnSOD 0amtDNA 0aMW 0an 0aO2 0aO2− 0aPCR 0aROS 0aSD 0aSIRS 0aSNP 0aSOD 0aSOFA 0aSPSS 0aST 0aTNF-α 0aVal 0aX2 0aCritical illness 0aSepsis 0aSeptic shock 0a47C>T SOD2 SNP 0aSOD2 Ala-9Val polymorphism1 aPicanço, Juliane Bentes,1 aFallavena, Paulo Roberto Vargas1 aFraga, Lucas da Rosa1 aGraebin, Pietra1 aNóbrega, Otávio de Toledo1 aDias, Fernando Suparregui1 aAlho, Clarice Sampaio0 tGene.g2013 Mar. 15, v. 517 p.106-111dElsevier B.V.x0378-11197nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gene.2012.10.0783Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03252naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004400094040001800138100002700156245014500183300001400328520159200342592002801934650001101962650001701973650001901990650002402009650001502033650001502048650001202063650001302075650002302088650002202111650001402133650001202147650001002159650002702169650001102196650001502207650002402222650002002246650002502266650000902291650000902300650001402309651001102323653002002334653000902354653003302363653001702396653001302413700002302426700002102449773010302470856009202573852000902665655001202674IND60569468320221123001827.0170530e201703  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056946832DNAL7 a10.1655/Herpetologica-D-16-00046.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMartins, Lídia Farias10aPopulation Estimates for the Sand Lizard, Liolaemus arambarensis: Contributions to the Conservation of an Endemic Species of Southern Brazil  ap. 55-62.  aThere have been relatively few studies on the population structure of species from countries having high levels of biodiversity, such as Brazil, even though most species are at some risk of extinction. Precise estimates of population parameters, such as abundance and survival probability, are necessary for evaluating the status of populations and developing management policies for species and their associated habitats. Here, we used mark–recapture methods to model the demography of the sand lizard, Liolaemus arambarensis, an endemic species of southern Brazil. Specifically, we estimated population size, survival probability, and sex ratio of three populations, while accounting for imperfect individual detectability. Our goal was to evaluate how the population structure of this species reflects its conservation status according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List. The estimated population size of mature individuals was higher than 250 individuals but lower than 2500 individuals; therefore, the species should be categorized as Endangered by IUCN population criteria. Monthly survival probability of adult females, adult males, and juveniles was relatively high (ranging from 0.74 to 0.85), whereas capture and recapture probabilities were low (ranging from 0.01 to 0.22). The accelerated degradation and alteration of sand lizard habitat, restinga areas of the Southern Coastal Plain, highlight the importance of long-term monitoring to detect future patterns of fluctuation and possible population declines of its few known populations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadults 3abiodiversity 3acoastal plains 3aconservation status 3ademography 3aextinction 3afemales 3ahabitats 3aindigenous species 3aissues and policy 3ajuveniles 3alizards 3amales 3amark-recapture studies 3amodels 3amonitoring 3apopulation dynamics 3apopulation size 3apopulation structure 3arisk 3asand 3asex ratio 3aBrazil 0aExtinction risk 0aIUCN 0aLiolaemidae, Population size 0aRobust model 0aSurvival1 aGuimarães, Murilo1 aVerrastro, Laura0 tHerpetologica.g2017 Mar., v. 73, no. 1 p.55-62dThe Herpetologists' League, Inc.x1938-50997nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1655%2FHerpetologica-D-16-00046.13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03090naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024003500135040001800170100002100188245008100209300001100290506007600301520148200377592002801859596004501887506003701932650001601969650001001985650001201995650001902007650001302026650001302039650001902052650001602071650001702087650001602104650001102120650001202131650002102143650002502164650001702189650001802206650002002224650001102244650001202255650001102267700001902278700005702297773010302354856008202457852000902539655001202548IND60614265320221207061900.0220518e201812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061426532DNAL7 a302618692pmid7 aPMC61613492pmcid7 a10.1186/s12898-018-0192-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAllman, Brian P.10aLeaf herbivory by insects during summer reduces overwinter browsing by moose  ap. 38.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: Damage to plants by herbivores potentially affects the quality and quantity of the plant tissue available to other herbivore taxa that utilize the same host plants at a later time. This study addresses the indirect effects of insect herbivores on mammalian browsers, a particularly poorly-understood class of interactions. Working in the Alaskan boreal forest, we investigated the indirect effects of insect damage to Salix interior leaves during the growing season on the consumption of browse by moose during winter, and on quantity and quality of browse production. RESULTS: Treatment with insecticide reduced leaf mining damage by the willow leaf blotch miner, Micrurapteryx salicifoliella, and increased both the biomass and proportion of the total production of woody tissue browsed by moose. Salix interior plants with experimentally-reduced insect damage produced significantly more stem biomass than controls, but did not differ in stem quality as indicated by nitrogen concentration or protein precipitation capacity, an assay of the protein-binding activity of tannins. CONCLUSIONS: Insect herbivory on Salix, including the outbreak herbivore M. salicifoliella, affected the feeding behavior of moose. The results demonstrate that even moderate levels of leaf damage by insects can have surprisingly strong impacts on stem production and influence the foraging behavior of distantly related taxa browsing on woody tissue months after leaves have dropped.  aPublisher supplied data  aDEB 1026415cNational Science Foundation0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aAlces alces 3aSalix 3abiomass 3aboreal forests 3abrowsing 3aforaging 3agrowing season 3ahost plants 3ainsecticides 3aleaf blotch 3aleaves 3amammals 3anitrogen content 3aphytophagous insects 3aplant damage 3aplant tissues 3aprotein binding 3asummer 3atannins 3awinter1 aKielland, Knut1 aWagner, Diane1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0504-49290 tBMC ecology.g2018 Dec., v. 18, no. 1 p.38-38dBioMed CentralwJournal:jnl4138408x1472-67857nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12898-018-0192-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03967naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100006100152245015300213500001900366520216100385592002802546650002302574650005202597650001802649650001502667650001902682650002102701650003102722650001002753650001102763650002002774650001402794650001402808650001302822650001302835650001302848650001702861650003602878650001302914650001202927653004102939653004802980653001503028653002503043653003403068653001103102653002903113700001903142700001903161700003003180773009503210856008703305852000903392655001203401IND60740453320221119205407.0210619e202108  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074045332DNAL7 a10.1016/j.virusres.2021.1984642doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPolicard, Martine1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9800-584310aImmune characterization and profiles of SARS-CoV-2 infected patients reveals potential host therapeutic targets and SARS-CoV-2 oncogenesis mechanism  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe spread of SARS-CoV-2 and the increasing mortality rates of COVID-19 create an urgent need for treatments, which are currently lacking. Although vaccines have been approved by the FDA for emergency use in the U.S., patients will continue to require pharmacologic intervention to reduce morbidity and mortality as vaccine availability remains limited. The rise of new variants makes the development of therapeutic strategies even more crucial to combat the current pandemic and future outbreaks. Evidence from several studies suggests the host immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infection plays a critical role in disease pathogenesis. Consequently, host immune factors are becoming more recognized as potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets for COVID-19. To develop therapeutic strategies to combat current and future coronavirus outbreaks, understanding how the coronavirus hijacks the host immune system during and after the infection is crucial. In this study, we investigated immunological patterns or characteristics of the host immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infection that may contribute to the disease severity of COVID-19 patients. We analyzed large bulk RNASeq and single cell RNAseq data from COVID-19 patient samples to immunoprofile differentially expressed gene sets and analyzed pathways to identify human host protein targets. We observed an immunological profile of severe COVID-19 patients characterized by upregulated cytokines, interferon-induced proteins, and pronounced T cell lymphopenia, supporting findings by previous studies. We identified a number of host immune targets including PERK, PKR, TNF, NF-kB, and other key genes that modulate the significant pathways and genes identified in COVID-19 patients. Finally, we identified genes modulated by COVID-19 infection that are implicated in oncogenesis, including E2F transcription factors and RB1, suggesting a mechanism by which SARS-CoV-2 infection may contribute to oncogenesis. Further clinical investigation of these targets may lead to bonafide therapeutic strategies to treat the current COVID-19 pandemic and protect against future outbreaks and viral escape variants.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCOVID-19 infection 3aSevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 3aT-lymphocytes 3abiomarkers 3acarcinogenesis 3adisease severity 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3ahumans 3aimmune response 3amorbidity 3amortality 3apandemic 3apatients 3aresearch 3atherapeutics 3atranscription factor NF-kappa B 3avaccines 3aviruses 0aImmune profiling of COVID19 patients 0aImmune characterization of COVID19 patients 0aSARS-COV-2 0aBulk RNASeq analysis 0aSingle cell scRNAseq analysis 0aCancer 0aGene expression analysis1 aJain, Sidharth1 aRego, Samantha1 aDakshanamurthy, Sivanesan0 tVirus research.g2021 Aug., v. 301 p.198464-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6283x0168-17027nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.virusres.2021.1984643Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02952naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001400151245015500165300001600320520133800336592002801674650002101702650001801723650001701741650002001758650003101778650001001809650001801819650002101837650001301858650001901871650001701890650002001907650002601927650002001953653001101973653000901984653000701993653000802000653001802008653001702026700001402043700001402057700001702071700001702088700001602105700001702121700001702138700001202155700001602167773010802183856008602291852000902377655001202386IND60630970620221119024512.0190326e20190510xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063097062DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scienta.2019.02.0242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Wei10aMethyl jasmonate, salicylic acid and abscisic acid enhance the accumulation of glucosinolates and sulforaphane in radish (Raphanus sativus L.) taproot  ap. 159-167.  aRadish is an important root vegetable crop. The effects of environmental stresses on glucosinolate (GLS) contents were extensively investigated in Brassicaceae species. However, little is known about the accumulation of GLS and sulforaphane (SF) in hormone-treated radish taproot. In this study, the effects of methyl jasmonate (MeJA), salicylic acid (SA) and abscisic acid (ABA) on the accumulation of GLS and SF in radish taproot were investigated. The GLS content increased considerably in response to MeJA treatment. Moreover, MeJA also up-regulated the expression level of several transcription factors and GLS biosynthesis related genes. The effects of SA on GLS content were less obvious, while ABA suppressed GLS biosynthesis. Additionally, the SF content increased under treatments with MeJA, SA and ABA. Furthermore, changes in myrosinase activity and glucoraphanin (GRA) content after the application of MeJA, SA and ABA were consistent with the changes in SF contents. The results indicated that the MeJA represents one of the most effective plant growth regulators (PGRs) for increasing the GLS content in radish taproot by up-regulating the expression levels of a few GLS biosynthetic related genes. These findings also implied that SF formation is correlated with myrosinase activity and GRA content in radish taproot.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRaphanus sativus 3aabscisic acid 3abiosynthesis 3aenzyme activity 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3aglucoraphanin 3amethyl jasmonate 3aradishes 3asalicylic acid 3asulforaphane 3athioglucosidase 3atranscription factors 3avegetable crops 0aRadish 0aMeJA 0aSA 0aABA 0aGlucosinolate 0aSulforaphane1 aWang, Yan1 aXu, Liang1 aDong, Junhui1 aZhu, Xianwen1 aYing, Jiali1 aWang, Qijiao1 aFan, Lianxue1 aLi, Cui1 aLiu, Liwang0 tScientia horticulturae.g2019 May 10, v. 250 p.159-167dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4108x0304-42387nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scienta.2019.02.0243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02827naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100005900144245008100203300001600284520138400300592002801684650001501712650001401727650001401741650002301755650001301778650001701791650002101808650001101829650001301840650001301853650002201866650001101888650002201899653000801921653002101929653001901950653001401969653000801983653001801991700006102009700006302070773013702133856007802270852000902348655001202357IND60627029420221117223632.0190128e20181206xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062702942DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.8b135052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKavalsky, Lance1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7875-565210aPhosphorene as a Catalyst for Highly Efficient Nonaqueous Li–Air Batteries  ap. 499-510.  aLi–air batteries can yield exceptionally high predicted energy densities. However, for this technology to become realizable, round-trip efficiency issues and slow kinetics at the cathode require implementation of a catalyst. With design parameters not well understood and limitations on material selection, choosing an ideal catalyst is complex. In Li–air batteries, energy storage is achieved by reactions between Li and O (oxygen reduction reaction for discharge and oxygen evolution reaction for charge). Here, phosphorene is proposed as a solution through simulations of its catalytic behavior toward discharge initiated via either O₂ dissociation or Li adsorption. After obtaining intermediate geometries for both nucleation paths leading to either Li₂O₂ or 2(Li₂O), free-energy diagrams are generated to predict the promoted discharge product of Li₂O₂. Furthermore, considering a final product of Li₂O₂, the overpotentials are predicted to be 1.44 V for discharge and 2.63 V for charge. Activation barriers for the catalytic decomposition of Li₂O₂ (during charge) are found to be 1.01 eV for phosphorene versus 2.06 eV for graphene. This leads to a major difference in reaction rate up to 10¹⁷ times in favor of phosphorene. These results, complemented by electronic analysis, establish phosphorene as a promising catalyst for Li–air batteries.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3abatteries 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3acathodes 3adissociation 3aelectrochemistry 3aenergy 3ageometry 3agraphene 3amaterials science 3aoxygen 3aoxygen production 0aDFT 0aLi−air battery 0a2D phosphorene 0acatalysis 0aNEB 0aoverpotential1 aMukherjee, Sankha1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9094-05381 aSingh, Chandra Veer1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6644-01780 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2018 Dec. 06, v. 11, no. 1 p.499-510dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.8b135053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02944naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001500140245014000155300001800295520147500313592002801788650001701816650002101833650001401854650002301868650001501891650002101906650002201927650001801949650001101967650001301978650000901991650001702000650001802017650001502035650001402050650001102064650002002075700001802095700001902113700001602132700001702148700001602165700001602181700001702197773014102214856007402355852000902429655001202438IND60641772720221122153747.0190506e20160517xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064177272DNAL7 a10.1039/c6ta01655c2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Yun10aSodium chloride-assisted green synthesis of a 3D Fe–N–C hybrid as a highly active electrocatalyst for the oxygen reduction reaction  ap. 7781-7787.  aTo promote the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) on a non-precious-metal catalyst, integrating two-dimensional (2D) nanosheets and one-dimensional (1D) nanotubes in one catalyst is considered as one of the desirable approaches since this hybrid architecture can host more useful active sites and enhance mass/electron transfer. Herein, we demonstrated a sodium chloride-assisted strategy for the in situ synthesis of a three-dimensional (3D) hybrid of carbon nanosheets and nanotubes. The micrometer-scale sodium chloride (NaCl) crystal acted as a recyclable skeleton to adsorb the precursors on its surfaces, which assisted the formation of micrometer-sized graphitic carbon nanosheets with nanometer thickness by the template effect during the pyrolysis, and iron-based nanocrystals with a size of tens of nanometers by helping the distribution of iron sources and preventing their aggregation. The small iron-based nanocrystals favored the growth of long CNTs connected to carbon nanosheets and the outmigration of carbon atoms during the cooling process, which led to the formation of carbon-layer encapsulated metallic iron nanoparticles between the carbon nanosheets or inside the carbon nanotubes. Benefiting from these features, the developed hybrid exhibited a significantly enhanced electrocatalytic activity and durability for the ORR. The results may open up opportunities for exploring cost-effective high-performance electrocatalysts for energy applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactive sites 3acarbon nanotubes 3acatalysts 3acost effectiveness 3adurability 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectron transfer 3aencapsulation 3aenergy 3agraphene 3airon 3ananocrystals 3ananoparticles 3ananosheets 3apyrolysis 3asodium 3asodium chloride1 aHuang, Lin-Bo1 aJiang, Wen-Jie1 aZhang, Xing1 aChen, Yu-Yun1 aWei, Zidong1 aWan, Li-Jun1 aHu, Jin-Song0 tJournal of materials chemistry A.g2016 May 17, v. 4, no. 20 p.7781-7787dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26903x2050-74967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c6ta01655c3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03203naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100002400138245011600162520193300278592002802211650002702239650001402266650002102280650001502301650001102316650001102327650002502338650001602363650002302379650001802402650002702420651001202447700002402459700003402483700002602517700003002543700002002573773011902593856007202712852000902784655001202793IND60653169220221117225306.0190714e20161104xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065316922DNAL7 a10.3390/w81105072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVizcaíno, Iván P.10aSpatio-Temporal Analysis of Water Quality Parameters in Machángara River with Nonuniform Interpolation Methods  aWater quality measurements in rivers are usually performed at intervals of days or months in monitoring campaigns, but little attention has been paid to the spatial and temporal dynamics of those measurements. In this work, we propose scrutinizing the scope and limitations of state-of-the-art interpolation methods aiming to estimate the spatio-temporal dynamics (in terms of trends and structures) of relevant variables for water quality analysis usually taken in rivers. We used a database with several water quality measurements from the Machángara River between 2002 and 2007 provided by the Metropolitan Water Company of Quito, Ecuador. This database included flow rate, temperature, dissolved oxygen, and chemical oxygen demand, among other variables. For visualization purposes, the absence of measurements at intermediate points in an irregular spatio-temporal sampling grid was fixed by using deterministic and stochastic interpolation methods, namely, Delaunay and k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN). For data-driven model diagnosis, a study on model residuals was performed comparing the quality of both kinds of approaches. For most variables, a value of k = 15 yielded a reasonable fitting when Mahalanobis distance was used, and water quality variables were better estimated when using the kNN method. The use of kNN provided the best estimation capabilities in the presence of atypical samples in the spatio-temporal dynamics in terms of leave-one-out absolute error, and it was better for variables with slow-changing dynamics, though its performance degraded for variables with fast-changing dynamics. The proposed spatio-temporal analysis of water quality measurements provides relevant and useful information, hence complementing and extending the classical statistical analysis in this field, and our results encourage the search for new methods overcoming the limitations of the analyzed traditional interpolators.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemical oxygen demand 3adatabases 3adissolved oxygen 3amonitoring 3aoxygen 3arivers 3astatistical analysis 3atemperature 3atemporal variation 3awater quality 3awater quality analysis 3aEcuador1 aCarrera, Enrique V.1 aSanromán-Junquera, Margarita1 aMuñoz-Romero, Sergio1 aLuis Rojo-Álvarez, José1 aCumbal, Luis H.0 tWater.g2016 Nov. 04, v. 8, no. 11dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21688x2073-44417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w81105073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02008naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002100145245009900166300001400265520089300279592002801172650002201200650001201222650001801234650002201252650002701274650001001301653002901311653001801340653002201358653001401380653002201394653003301416773010701449856008101556852000901637655001201646IND60479879420221119204127.0160123e20090301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6047987942DNAL7 a10.1556/CRC.37.2009.1.42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDudnikov, A.

The currently administered vaccines depend on adenovirus DNA vectors or on SARS-CoV-2 mRNA that might become reverse transcribed into DNA, however infrequently. In some societies, people have become sensitized against the potential short- or long-term side effects of foreign DNA being injected into humans. In my laboratory, the fate of foreign DNA in mammalian (human) cells and organisms has been investigated for many years. In this review, a summary of the results obtained will be presented. This synopsis has been put in the evolutionary context of retrotransposon insertions into pre-human genomes millions of years ago. In addition, studies on adenovirus vector-based DNA, on the fate of food-ingested DNA as well as the long-term persistence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA/DNA will be described. Actual integration of viral DNA molecules and of adenovirus vector DNA will likely be chance events whose frequency and epigenetic consequences cannot with certainty be assessed. The review also addresses problems of remaining adenoviral gene expression in adenoviral-based vectors and their role in side effects of vaccines. Eventually, it will come down to weighing the possible risks of genomic insertions of vaccine-associated foreign DNA and unknown levels of vector-carried adenoviral gene expression versus protection against the dangers of Covid-19. A decision in favor of vaccination against life-threatening disease appears prudent. Informing the public about the complexities of biology will be a reliable guide when having to reach personal decisions about vaccinations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAdenoviridae 3aCOVID-19 infection 3aDNA 3aSevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 3aepigenetics 3agene expression 3agenomics 3ahumans 3apandemic 3apeople 3aresearch 3aretrotransposons 3avaccination 3aviruses 0aAdenovirus DNA integration into mammalian genomes 0aadenovirus vector DNA integration into human genome 0aexpression of adenoviral genes in vector DNA 0aadenovirus vector DNA & RNA-based SARS-CoV-2 vaccines 0aepigenetic consequences of foreign DNA integration 0aretrotranscription of SARS-CoV-2 RNA into DNA0 tVirus research.g2021 Sept., v. 302 p.198466-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6283x0168-17027nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.virusres.2021.1984663Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02308naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245009100158300001800249520115200267592002801419650001901447650001401466650002801480650002101508650002201529650001301551650002401564650001801588650001101606650001701617700001801634700001601652700001401668700001601682773014101698856007401839852000901913655001201922IND60641772820221122084250.0190506e20160531xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064177282DNAL7 a10.1039/c6ta01657j2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Jintao10aRational design of graphitic carbon based nanostructures for advanced electrocatalysis  ap. 8497-8511.  aThe development of electrocatalysts plays a pivotal role in electrocatalytic reactions because the catalyst determines not only the overall reaction efficiency but also the cost. Carbon materials with good electrical conductivity and large surface area have been used as efficient electrocatalyst supports for a wide range of electrocatalyses. Recently, it has been realized that carbons themselves are also promising nonmetal electrocatalysts. In this regard, the electrocatalytic activities of carbons can be tailored by surface modification or building in particular dopants/defects. In the accumulation of the profound knowledge of the electrocatalytic nature and the technological advances, there is increasing interest in developing carbon-based catalysts for various applications. In this review, we summarize the recent progress in the rational design and preparation of graphitic carbon-based materials for advanced electrocatalysis including oxygen reduction and evolution reactions, hydrogen evolution reaction, and carbon dioxide reduction, to provide deep insights into the electrocatalysis for advanced energy conversion and storage.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon dioxide 3acatalysts 3aelectrical conductivity 3aelectrochemistry 3aenergy conversion 3agraphene 3ahydrogen production 3ananomaterials 3aoxygen 3asurface area1 aLi, Hongliang1 aGuo, Peizhi1 aMa, Houyi1 aZhao, X.

Glutathione is involved in antioxidant defence and drug detoxification. Intracellular reduced glutathione (GSH) concentration can be used as an indicator of the health of cells. This work describes a simple and fast fluorescent cell-based assay for the evaluation of intracellular GSH in the alga P. subcapitata, using monochlorobimane (mBCl). Metabolically active algal cells incubated with 50 μmol L−1 mBCl form fluorescent bimane–glutathione (B-SG) adducts that can be measured fluorometrically. The distribution of GSH (B-SG adducts) in whole cells can be observed by epifluorescence microscopy, in the form of blue fluorescent spots. Depletion of cellular GSH with iodoacetamide, inhibition of glutathione S-transferase with ethacrynic acid or heat-induced death of the cells inhibited the formation of fluorescent adducts in the presence of mBCl. The fluorometric assay, using the 96-well microplate format, was able to detect GSH depletion in algal cells. This cell-based assay can be used to evaluate decreases in GSH content due to exposure to toxicants. This assay is amenable to automation and may be useful in high-throughput toxicity screening using the alga P. subcapitata.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSelenastrum capricornutum 3aautomation 3adeath 3adrugs 3aethacrynic acid 3afluorometry 3aglutathione 3aglutathione transferase 3amicroscopy 3apollutants 3ascreening 3atoxic substances 3atoxicity1 aSoares, Eduardo V.0 tJournal of applied phycology.g2012 Dec., v. 24, no. 6 p.1509-1516dSpringer-Verlagx0921-89717nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10811-012-9811-7  aDNAL 7aarticle03163naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100001600138245010300154520217100257592002802428650002202456650001102478650002102489650001102510650002102521650003002542650001802572651001002590700001902600700001802619773011902637856007202756852000902828655001202837IND60653169420221117225358.0190714e20161104xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065316942DNAL7 a10.3390/w81105092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZuo, Qiting10aHarmonious Development between Socio-Economy and River-Lake Water Systems in Xiangyang City, China  aRiver-lake water systems (RLS) are important carriers for matter transformation and energy transmission. Influenced by accelerated social and economic development, the structural, functional, and environmental states of RLS have been seriously damaged. It is an important problem for human beings to coordinate the contradiction between socio-economic development and the protection of RLS. In order to quantitatively study the harmonious relationship between socio-economic development and the state of RLS, the harmony theory method was used to analyze the degree of harmonious development between socio-economy and RLS in this study taking Xiangyang City as an example, and formulating corresponding harmonious optimization schemes. The results indicate that: (1) the state of RLS had a relatively small change during 2009–2014, and its spatial distribution shows a decreasing trend with the Han River as the central axis decreases on both of its sides; (2) before 2011, the driving force of socio-economic development in Xiang yang City mainly originated in the peripheral regions such as Laohekou City, Zaoyang City, and Gucheng County, but after 2011, it migrated rapidly towards Downtown, and reached the maximum in 2014; (3) when the influence of regional socio-economic development on RLS is small, socio-economic development is the main factor driving the change of the overall harmonious development degree of socio-economy and RLS. However when the influence is big, it is combined, driven by socio-economic development and the state of RLS; (4) the main factors affecting the overall harmonious degree of socio-economy and RLS in Xiangyang City include: river length, standard ratio of water quality, water consumption per capita, reservoir regulation capability, farmland irrigation water consumption per Mu (Mu is an area unit in China, 1 Mu approximately equals to 666.67 m2), and sewage treatment rate. This study can provide a reference for the future analysis of the harmonious development between socio-economy and RLS, as well as in formulating corresponding harmonious optimization schemes in China and other countries in a similar situation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural land 3aenergy 3airrigation water 3arivers 3asewage treatment 3asocioeconomic development 3awater quality 3aChina1 aLuo, Zengliang1 aDing, Xiangyi0 tWater.g2016 Nov. 04, v. 8, no. 11dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21688x2073-44417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w81105093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03523naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002200150245010700172520176200279592002802041650001402069650001002083650001902093650002002112650001502132650001002147650000902157650001002166650002402176650002302200650002302223650001802246650001202264650003502276650001402311650001302325650001102338650002302349650001202372650002002384651001402404653001702418653001702435653001702452653002102469653001202490653002602502700001602528700001902544700001502563700001802578700001802596700001602614700001902630700001802649700001702667773010702684856008502791852000902876655001202885IND60674085620221121071826.0220830e201911  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067408562DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biocon.2019.1082612doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWoinarski, J.C.Z.10aReading the black book: The number, timing, distribution and causes of listed extinctions in Australia  aThrough collation of global, national and state/territory threatened species lists, we conclude that 100 Australian endemic species (one protist, 38 vascular plants, ten invertebrates, one fish, four frogs, three reptiles, nine birds and 34 mammals) are validly listed as extinct (or extinct in the wild) since the nation’s colonisation by Europeans in 1788. This tally represents about 6–10% of the world’s post-1500 recognised extinctions. The actual number of extinctions is likely to be far more than those recognised in formal lists. Mammals have suffered the highest proportional rate of extinction (ca. 10% of the endemic mammal fauna). There are four main distributional features of these extinctions: (i) consistent with global patterns, island endemic species are disproportionately represented; (ii) many non-island extinct species had highly restricted mainland ranges; but conversely (iii) many extinct mammals had extensive ranges; and (iv) there have been no recognised extinctions of species confined to Australia’s mainland monsoonal tropics. Extinctions have occurred largely continuously since Australia’s European settlement, with at least three extinctions in the last decade. Mammal extinctions were caused mainly by introduced predators; plant extinctions by habitat loss; frog extinctions by disease; reptile extinctions by an introduced snake; and invertebrate extinctions by a range of anthropogenic processes. Causality has changed over time, with recent extinctions more likely to be associated with disease, introduced reptiles and introduced fish and less likely to be associated with hunting and introduced mammalian predators. The most recent extinction is the sole case for which climate change was a major factor.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEuropeans 3abirds 3aclimate change 3aextinct species 3aextinction 3afauna 3afish 3afrogs 3ahabitat destruction 3aindigenous species 3aintroduced species 3ainvertebrates 3amammals 3anatural resources conservation 3apredators 3aprotists 3asnakes 3athreatened species 3atropics 3avascular plants 3aAustralia 0aBiodiversity 0aConservation 0aHabitat loss 0aInvasive species 0aIslands 0aThreatening processes1 aBraby, M.F.1 aBurbidge, A.A.1 aCoates, D.1 aGarnett, S.T.1 aFensham, R.J.1 aLegge, S.M.1 aMcKenzie, N.L.1 aSilcock, J.L.1 aMurphy, B.P.0 tBiological conservation.g2019 Nov., v. 239 p.108261-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl44607x0006-32077nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biocon.2019.1082613Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02618naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001900144245012300163300001800286520114000304592002801444650001001472650000901482650002601491650001701517650001301534650001301547650001401560650000901574650001501583653002601598653002001624653001301644653001701657653001401674700001801688700001801706700001701724700001901741700001801760700005601778700001901834700005701853773013901910856007802049852000902127655001202136IND60627029720221117223752.0190128e20181204xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062702972DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.8b137672doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKwon, Oh Hyeon10aPlasmonic-Enhanced Luminescence Characteristics of Microscale Phosphor Layers on a ZnO Nanorod-Arrayed Glass Substrate  ap. 1004-1012.  aWe present a planar luminescent layer for glare-free, long-lifespan white light-emitting diodes (LEDs), with attractive light outputs. The novel and facile remote phosphor approach proposed in this work enhances luminescence properties by combining a waveguiding ZnO-based nanostructure with plasmonic Au nanoparticles. The system comprised a microscale yellow phosphor layer that is applied by simple printing onto an Au nanoparticle-dispersed ZnO nanorod array. This architecture resulted in a considerable enhancement in luminous efficacy of approximately 18% because of the combination of waveguide effects from the nanorod structure and plasmonic effects from the Au nanoparticles. Performance was optimized according to the length of the Zn nanorods and the concentration of Au. An optimal efficiency of ∼84.26 lm/W for a silicate phosphor-converted LED was achieved using long ZnO nanorods and an Au concentration of 12.5 ppm. The finite-difference time-domain method was successfully used to verify the luminous efficacy improvements in the Au nanoparticle-intervened nanostructures via the waveguiding and plasmonic effects.  aPublisher supplied data 3aglass 3agold 3alight emitting diodes 3aluminescence 3ananogold 3ananorods 3asilicates 3azinc 3azinc oxide 0alight-emitting diodes 0aremote phosphor 0aprinting 0aZnO nanorods 0aplasmonic1 aJang, Jin Woo1 aPark, Sun-Joo1 aKim, Jun Sik1 aHong, Sung Jun1 aJung, Ye Seul1 aYang, Heesun1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2827-20701 aKim, Youngjoo,1 aCho, Yong Soo1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1601-63950 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2018 Dec. 04, v. 11, no. 1 p.1004-1012dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.8b137673Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03959naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002300148245010700171300001100278500001900289520268200308592002802990650002003018650001503038650001803053650001303071650002803084650001103112650001703123650001703140650002003157651001003177700001703187700002003204700002303224700002003247700001703267700006203284773009903346856008303445852000903528655001203537IND60717190220221118222152.0210209e202012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071719022DNAL7 a10.1186/s40795-020-00382-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKyei-Arthur, Frank10aLessons learned from implementing the pilot Micronutrient Powder Initiative in four districts in Ghana  ap. 50.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aBACKGROUND: Micronutrient deficiencies affect many children in low-income settings due primarily to over-reliance on complementary foods low in nutrients. Home-fortification (HF) could improve children’s diet quality in these settings. The Ghana Health Service, supported by UNICEF, integrated the pilot Micronutrient Powder Initiative (MPI) into Child Welfare Clinic (CWC) services in four districts (Tain, Tolon, Talensi, and Ho West), whereby micronutrient powder (MNP) is supplied for HF for children aged 6–23 months attending CWCs. This study’s main aim was to identify the facilitators, barriers and “lessons learned” after 2 years of program implementation. METHODS: This was a qualitative cross-sectional study. MNP distributed and children enrolled were obtained from program records. Primary data were collected from November to December 2019 and included, by district: interviews with senior program staff; key informant interviews and focus group discussion with caregivers in each of 6 sub-districts; and discussions workshop with frontline staff from at least 10 health facilities. Besides field notes, all interactions were audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim. Qualitative data were analyzed using NVivo10. RESULTS: The MPI remains on-going, with about 2.5 million MNP sachets distributed to nearly 30,000 children within 90 district-months. Caregivers generally accept the MNP; reported positive responses in children include: “increased appetite”, “less frequent illnesses, “increased energy/strength”, “increased weight”, and “walking independently relatively early”. Main facilitators are: generally regular MNP availability; increased patronage of CWC services; various contact points for supplying MNPs; fairly strong social mobilization strategy; good integration of MPI with CWC services; “one-on-one” counselling for caregivers reporting side effects; and tracing caregivers to address concerns and monitor adherence. Main barriers are: lack of counselling materials; caregivers’ suspicions towards the program; absence of refresher training for frontline workers; and perceived MNP side-effects. Key lessons learned are: incorporating MNPs into CWC services is feasible, acceptable, and could reduce child micronutrient deficiencies in program districts; and MPI’s success requires stronger community sensitization, equipping frontline workers to advise caregivers and manage side-effects, and consciously identifying and managing logistical challenges. CONCLUSION: Further research is needed to evaluate the effectiveness of the MPI in reducing micronutrient deficiencies among 6–23-months-olds in Ghana.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadverse effects 3acaregivers 3achild welfare 3achildren 3across-sectional studies 3aenergy 3afocus groups 3afood quality 3ahealth services 3aGhana1 aSituma, Ruth1 aAballo, Jevaise1 aMahama, Abraham B.1 aSelenje, Lilian1 aAmoaful, Esi1 aAdu-Afarwuah, Seth1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2720-54740 tBMC nutrition.g2020 Dec., v. 6, no. 1 p.50-50dBioMed CentralwJournal:27315x2055-09287nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s40795-020-00382-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02819naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002000149245015100169520141200320592002801732650001601760650001501776650001801791650001301809650001601822650001201838650001801850650001401868650001301882650001401895650001601909651001001925651001301935700002401948700002101972700001901993700002702012700002002039700002402059700002302083700002902106773013402135856008302269852000902352655001202361IND60751398720221120131849.0210925e20210912xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075139872DNAL7 a10.3390/agriculture110908732doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBregant, Carlo 10aPhylogeny and Pathogenicity of Phytophthora Species Associated with Artichoke Crown and Root Rot and Description of Phytophthora marrasii sp. nov.  aField surveys conducted on nine farms over a 2-year period showed the widespread presence of Phytophthora-related diseases on globe artichoke plants in the main growing area in Sardinia (Italy). Characteristic symptoms included wilting and necrosis of the outermost leaves and dark brown discoloration of stem tissues, as well as root rot. A total of 18 Phytophthora colonies belonging to three species were isolated and characterized. Based on morphological features and ITS sequence data, Phytophthora isolates were identified as P. crassamura (eight isolates) and P. cactorum (four isolates). Six isolates could not be assigned to any formally described species of Phytophthora and are therefore described here as Phytophthora marrasii sp. nov. The ITS phylogeny places P. marrasii in a terminal clade basal to the sister taxa (P. foliorum, P. hibernalis, P. lateralis, and P. ramorum) of the clade 8c. In particular, P. marrasii is phylogenetically related to P. foliorum, a species from which it differs in 62 nucleotides in the ITS region. At the same time, it can easily be distinguished morphologically from P. foliorum mainly because of the low minimum temperature for growth, the bigger and persistent non-papillate sporangia, and smaller oogonia. Pathogenicity tests confirmed that all three Phytophthora species are pathogenic on globe artichokes, which represent a new host for these pathogens.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagriculture 3aartichokes 3adiscoloration 3anecrosis 3anucleotides 3aoogonia 3apathogenicity 3aphylogeny 3aroot rot 3asporangia 3atemperature 3aItaly 3aSardinia1 aRossetto, Giovanni 1 aDeidda, Antonio 1 aMaddau, Lucia 1 aFranceschini, Antonio 1 aIonta, Giorgio 1 aRaiola, Alessandro 1 aMontecchio, Lucio 1 aLinaldeddu, Benedetto T.0 tAgriculture (Basel).g2021 Sept. 12, v. 11, no. 9dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:12387x2077-04727nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agriculture110908733Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03474naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245008400169300001800253520246700271592002802738650001202766650003102778650001202809650001202821650001502833650002502848650000902873700001702882700001802899700002102917773010802938856008103046852000903127655001203136IND60586084920221118030213.0171116e201712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058608492DNAL7 a10.1007/s00382-017-3575-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDiNezio, Pedro N.10aPredictability of 2-year La Niña events in a coupled general circulation model  ap. 4237-4261.  aThe predictability of the duration of La Niña is assessed using the Community Earth System Model Version 1 (CESM1), a coupled climate model capable of simulating key features of the El Niño/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) phenomenon, including the multi-year duration of La Niña. Statistical analysis of a 1800 year long control simulation indicates that a strong thermocline discharge or a strong El Niño can lead to La Niña conditions that last 2 years (henceforth termed 2-year LN). This relationship suggest that 2-year LN maybe predictable 18 to 24 months in advance. Perfect model forecasts performed with CESM1 are used to further explore the link between 2-year LN and the “Discharge” and “Peak El Niño” predictors. Ensemble forecasts are initialized on January and July coinciding with ocean states characterized by peak El Niño amplitudes and peak thermocline discharge respectively. Three cases with different magnitudes of these predictors are considered resulting in a total of six ensembles. Each “Peak El Niño” and “Discharge” ensemble forecast consists of 30 or 20 members respectively, generated by adding a infinitesimally small perturbation to the atmospheric initial conditions unique to each member. The forecasts show that the predictability of 2-year LN, measured by the potential prediction utility (PPU) of the [Formula: see text]-3.4 SST index during the second year, is related to the magnitude of the initial conditions. Forecasts initialized with strong thermocline discharge or strong peak El Niño amplitude show higher PPU than those with initial conditions of weaker magnitude. Forecasts initialized from states characterized by weaker predictors are less predictable, mainly because the ensemble-mean signal is smaller, and therefore PPU is reduced due to the influence of forecast spread. The error growth of the forecasts, measured by the spread of the [Formula: see text]-3.4 SST index, is independent of the initial conditions and appears to be driven by wind variability over the southeastern tropical Pacific and the western equatorial Pacific. Analysis of observational data supports the modeling results, suggesting that the “thermocline discharge” and “Peak El Niño” predictors could also be used to diagnose the likelihood of multi-year La Niña events in nature. These results suggest that CESM1 could provide skillful long-range operational forecasts under specific initial conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEl Nino 3aGeneral Circulation Models 3aLa Nina 3aclimate 3aprediction 3astatistical analysis 3awind1 aDeser, Clara1 aOkumura, Yuko1 aKarspeck, Alicia0 tClimate dynamics.g2017 Dec., v. 49, no. 11-12 p.4237-4261dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx0930-75757nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00382-017-3575-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04095naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245013300169520250100302592002802803650001302831650001702844650001502861650001802876650001902894650001502913650002902928650002002957650002602977650001903003650002003022650000903042650002003051650001703071650001803088650001303106653001403119653001903133653002103152653001703173653001903190653002403209700002003233700002503253700002203278700002003300700002203320700002103342773009903363856008203462852000903544655001203553IND60697982220221122052411.0200621e202006  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069798222DNAL7 a10.1016/j.hal.2020.1018282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMishra, Deepak R.10aCyanoTRACKER: A cloud-based integrated multi-platform architecture for global observation of cyanobacterial harmful algal blooms  aOver the past decade, the global proliferation of cyanobacterial harmful algal blooms (CyanoHABs) have presented a major risk to the public and wildlife, and ecosystem and economic services provided by inland water resources. As a consequence, water resources, environmental, and healthcare agencies are in need of early information about the development of these blooms to mitigate or minimize their impact. Results from various components of a novel multi-cloud cyber-infrastructure referred to as “CyanoTRACKER” for initial detection and continuous monitoring of spatio-temporal growth of CyanoHABs is highlighted in this study. The novelty of the CyanoTRACKER framework is the collection and integration of combined community reports (social cloud), remote sensing data (sensor cloud) and digital image analytics (computation cloud) to detect and differentiate between regular algal blooms and CyanoHABs. Individual components of CyanoTRACKER include a reporting website, mobile application (App), remotely deployable solar powered automated hyperspectral sensor (CyanoSense), and a cloud-based satellite data processing and integration tool. All components of CyanoTRACKER provided important data related to CyanoHABs assessments for regional and global water bodies. Reports and data received via social cloud including the mobile App, Twitter, Facebook, and CyanoTRACKER website, helped in identifying the geographic locations of CyanoHABs affected water bodies. A significant increase (124.92%) in tweet numbers related to CyanoHABs was observed between 2011 (total relevant tweets = 2925) and 2015 (total relevant tweets = 6579) that reflected an increasing trend of the harmful phenomena across the globe as well as an increased awareness about CyanoHABs among Twitter users. The CyanoHABs affected water bodies extracted via the social cloud were categorized, and smaller water bodies were selected for the deployment of CyanoSense, and satellite data analysis was performed for larger water bodies. CyanoSense was able to differentiate between ordinary algae and CyanoHABs through the use of their characteristic absorption feature at 620 nm. The results and products from this infrastructure can be rapidly disseminated via the CyanoTRACKER website, social media, and direct communication with appropriate management agencies for issuing warnings and alerting lake managers, stakeholders and ordinary citizens to the dangers posed by these environmentally harmful phenomena.  aPublisher supplied data 3aInternet 3aalgal blooms 3aautomation 3adata analysis 3adigital images 3aecosystems 3aenvironmental monitoring 3ahealth services 3ahyperspectral imagery 3ainfrastructure 3apoisonous algae 3arisk 3asocial networks 3aspatial data 3asurface water 3awildlife 0aCyanoHABs 0aRemote sensing 0aWireless sensors 0aSocial media 0aSatellite data 0aCyberinfrastructure1 aKumar, Abhishek1 aRamaswamy, Lakshmish1 aBoddula, Vinay K.1 aDas, Moumita C.1 aPage, Benjamin P.1 aWeber, Samuel J.0 tHarmful algae.g2020 June, v. 96 p.101828-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl3946763x1568-98837nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.hal.2020.1018283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02449naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245008500168300001600253520137000269592002801639650001301667650001001680650002401690650001201714650001201726653001601738653001701754653001701771653001701788653001801805653002901823700001601852700001401868773009901882856008501981852000902066655001202075IND60601106920221118034900.0181127e201402  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060110692DNAL7 a10.1016/j.powtec.2013.10.0442doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYin, Hongchao10aNumerical simulation of three-dimensional unsteady granular flows in rotary kiln  ap. 138-145.  aThe granular particle motion with rolling mode in rotary kiln is investigated using a three-dimensional mathematical model based on the Euler–Euler two-phase flow and the kinetic theory of granular flow. The mathematical model verified by comparing with the published experimental data is used to simulate performance of an inclined rotary kiln. The angle of inclination and the residence time of particles in rotary kiln are taken into account. The active layer thickness can be calculated by observing the particle velocity change from positive to negative values. The stagnation point at the bottom of the free flowing zone is the interface between the active layer and the passive layer. Simulations show that the active layer of the charge end of the rotary kiln is thin and particle velocity is low. With the increase of axial distance, the active layer thickness and velocities of granular particles increase respectively, the thickness of the active layer and velocities of particles close to the discharge end of the rotary kiln decrease. A fourth-order polynomial velocity profile can be obtained from the numerical simulation results. Apart from providing a computationally efficient tool to simulate kiln performance, the results discussed here will provide a useful basis for the development of comprehensive three-dimensional models of rotary kilns.  aPublisher supplied data 3agranules 3akilns 3amathematical models 3apowders 3arolling 0aRotary kiln 0aRolling mode 0aSolid mixing 0aActive layer 0aPassive layer 0aSurface particle motions1 aZhang, Ming1 aLiu, Hong0 tPowder technology.g2014 Feb., v. 253 p.138-145dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11732x0032-59107nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.powtec.2013.10.0443Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02257naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100006100147245010400208300001600312520118400328592002801512650001501540650002001555650001301575650001501588650001501603650004301618650001901661650001601680700002001696700002001716773009201736856008201828852000901910655001201919IND60567177220221116231648.0220523e201702  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056717722DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jag.2016.09.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWatmough, Gary R.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0657-220813aAn operational framework for object-based land use classification of heterogeneous rural landscapes  ap. 134-144.  aThe characteristics of very high resolution (VHR) satellite data are encouraging development agencies to investigate its use in monitoring and evaluation programmes. VHR data pose challenges for land use classification of heterogeneous rural landscapes as it is not possible to develop generalised and transferable land use classification definitions and algorithms. We present an operational framework for classifying VHR satellite data in heterogeneous rural landscapes using an object-based and random forest classifier. The framework overcomes the challenges of classifying VHR data in anthropogenic landscapes. It does this by using an image stack of RGB-NIR, Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and textural bands in a two-phase object-based classification. The framework can be applied to data acquired by different sensors, with different view and illumination geometries, at different times of the year. Even with these complex input data the framework can produce classification results that are comparable across time. Here we describe the framework and present an example of its application using data from QuickBird (2 images) and GeoEye (1 image) sensors.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3adata collection 3aland use 3alandscapes 3amonitoring 3anormalized difference vegetation index 3aremote sensing 3arural areas1 aPalm, Cheryl A.1 aSullivan, Clare0 tITC journal.g2017 Feb., v. 54 p.134-144dElsevier B.V.wJournal:22337x1569-84327nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jag.2016.09.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03079naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002000148245010300168300001600271520143400287592002801721650004401749650002201793650003701815650001501852650002101867650002401888650002401912650001901936650001901955650001501974650002001989650001502009650003402024650003302058650002202091650003802113650001902151653001902170653002902189653000802218653000902226700001702235700001602252700001802268700005802286773012502344856008302469852000902552655001202561IND60650910820221119121621.0190913e20191015xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065091082DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcis.2019.06.1072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Xingchao10aConstruction of core-shell structured WO3@SnS2 hetero-junction as a direct Z-scheme photo-catalyst  ap. 229-238.  aAn ideal photocatalyst not only offers high photo-generated electron-hole pairs separation ability, but also has suitable redox potential. Here, a direct Z-scheme core-shell structured WO3@SnS2 hetero-junction photo-catalyst was prepared via two-step hydrothermal method, in which the core-shell structure, rod morphology and micro-composition of hetero-junction were confirmed through X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns, Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra, field emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM), transmission electron microscope (FEI-TEM) and X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS). Their enhanced photo-catalytic abilities were evaluated by photo-degradation of Rhodamine (RhB), photo-reduction of dichromate (Cr6+) solution and photo-catalytic H2 production through comparing with pure WO3, SnS2 or the mixture of WO3 and SnS2 (WO3/SnS2). The absorption spectra and electrochemical properties were used to estimate the band gap of samples, the expanded spectral absorption capacity and improved electron-hole separation ability, which are important factors for enhanced photocatalytic performance. Furthermore, the direct Z-scheme charge transfer mechanism of WO3@SnS2 hetero-junction was determined through the combination of theoretical calculation and experimental characterizations, which played a decisive role for retaining excellent redox potential and increasing photo-catalytic ability of WO3 and SnS2.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aX-ray diffraction 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3aabsorption 3aelectrochemistry 3ahot water treatment 3ahydrogen production 3aphotocatalysis 3aphotocatalysts 3aphotolysis 3aredox potential 3arhodamines 3ascanning electron microscopes 3ascanning electron microscopy 3aspectral analysis 3atransmission electron microscopes 3atungsten oxide 0aPhoto-catalyst 0aZ-scheme hetero-junction 0aWO3 0aSnS21 aZhang, Ruoyu1 aNiu, Siying1 aZheng, Jiming1 aGuo, Chongfeng1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0177-43690 tJournal of colloid and interface science.g2019 Oct. 15, v. 554 p.229-238dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12461x0021-97977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcis.2019.06.1073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02955naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002300150245008100173300001600254520152000270592002801790650001701818650002601835650002601861650001301887650001701900650001101917650001401928650001401942650000901956653005501965653002302020653003402043653003602077653003702113653001602150700002402166700002602190700002602216700001902242700002302261773011902284856008502403852000902488655001202497IND60525850320221117204008.0180829e201604  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052585032DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbagen.2016.01.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLinkuvienė, Vaida10aIntrinsic thermodynamics of inhibitor binding to human carbonic anhydrase IX  ap. 708-718.  aHuman carbonic anhydrase 9th isoform (CA IX) is an important marker of numerous cancers and is increasingly interesting as a potential anticancer drug target. Various synthetic aromatic sulfonamide-bearing compounds are being designed as potent inhibitors of CA IX. However, sulfonamide compound binding to CA IX is linked to several reactions, the deprotonation of the sulfonamide amino group and the protonation of the CA active site Zn(II)-bound hydroxide. These linked reactions significantly affect the affinities and other thermodynamic parameters such as enthalpies and entropies of binding.The observed and intrinsic affinities of compound binding to CA IX were determined by the fluorescent thermal shift assay. The enthalpies and entropies of binding were determined by the isothermal titration calorimetry.The pKa of CA IX was determined to be 6.8 and the enthalpy of CA IX-Zn(II)-bound hydroxide protonation was −24kJ/mol. These values enabled the analysis of intrinsic thermodynamics of a library of compounds binding to CA IX. The most strongly binding compounds exhibited the intrinsic affinity of 0.01nM and the observed affinity of 2nM.The intrinsic thermodynamic parameters of compound binding to CA IX helped to draw the compound structure to thermodynamics relationship.It is important to distinguish the intrinsic from observed parameters of any disease target protein interaction with its inhibitors as drug candidates when drawing detailed compound structure to thermodynamics correlations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactive sites 3aantineoplastic agents 3acarbonate dehydratase 3aenthalpy 3afluorescence 3ahumans 3aneoplasms 3atitration 3azinc 0aIntrinsic thermodynamics of protein-ligand binding 0aCarbonic anhydrase 0aBenzenesulfonamide inhibitors 0aFluorescent thermal shift assay 0aIsothermal titration calorimetry 0aDrug design1 aMatulienė, Jurgita1 aJuozapaitienė, Vaida1 aMichailovienė, Vilma1 aJachno, Jelena1 aMatulis, Daumantas0 tBiochimica et biophysica acta.g2016 Apr., v. 1860, no. 4 p.708-718dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11872x0304-41657nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbagen.2016.01.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02617naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003600111040001800147100001500165245007000180300001600250520097100266592002801237650001401265650001301279650001401292650000901306650001601315650001101331650002501342650001301367650001401380650001401394650001401408650001201422650005601434650003701490650004101527650000901568650001801577650001101595650005301606650003701659650003501696650002501731700001501756700002001771700001501791700001801806700001501824700001701839773010401856856008201960852000902042655001202051IND4471765120221121031651.0141111e201105  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447176512DNAL7 a211461792pmid7 a10.1016/j.jcpa.2010.10.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGiri, D.K.10aGiant Cell Glioblastoma in the Cerebrum of a Pembroke Welsh Corgi  ap. 324-327.  aA 6-year-old, neutered female Pembroke Welsh corgi was presented with a 1-month history of ataxia and panting. The clinical signs progressed until the dog became anorexic, obtunded and exhibited circling to the left. At necropsy examination, a mass was detected in the left forebrain, impinging on the cribriform plate. Microscopically, the mass was composed of sheets of round to pleomorphic neoplastic cells with vacuolated cytoplasm. Nuclear atypia, anisocytosis and anisokaryosis were common. Numerous bizarre, multinucleated giant cells containing 60 or more nuclei and giant mononuclear cells were present. The matrix contained abundant reticulin. Immunohistochemistry revealed the neoplastic cells uniformly to express vimentin, and a small number of neoplastic cells expressed glial fibrillary acid protein. A diagnosis of giant cell glioblastoma was made. Although well recognized in man, this tumour has been documented rarely in the veterinary literature.  aPublisher supplied data 3abreathing 3acerebrum 3acytoplasm 3adogs 3agiant cells 3ahumans 3aimmunohistochemistry 3anecropsy 3aneoplasms 3aneuroglia 3areticulin 2aAnimals 2aBrain Neoplasmsxmetabolismxpathologyxveterinary. 2aCerebrumxmetabolismxpathology. 2aDog Diseasesxmetabolismxpathology. 2aDogs 2aFatal Outcome 2aFemale 2aGlioblastomaxmetabolismxpathologyxveterinary. 2aImmunohistochemistryxveterinary 2aBiomarkers, Tumorxmetabolism. 2aVimentinxmetabolism1 aAlosio, F.1 aAjithdoss, D.K.1 aAmbrus, A.1 aLidbury, J.A.1 aHein, H.E.1 aPorter, B.F.0 tJournal of comparative pathology.g2011 May, v. 144, no. 4 p.324-327dElsevier Ltdx0021-99757nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcpa.2010.10.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02831naa a2200685 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003800113040001800151100001900169245009400188300001800282500001500300520071000315592002801025650001701053650001601070650001701086650001701103650001001120650001201130650001401142650002301156650002501179650001501204650001501219650002401234650008401258650002701342650002301369650002201392650002701414650004801441650001301489650003301502650002401535650005601559650002401615650002301639650002001662650007301682651001101755653000901766653002901775653001001804653002501814653001501839700001201854700001701866700002101883700001701904700001701921700001901938773011601957856005102073852000902124655001202133IND50087229720221123023524.0140412e20121101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5008722972DNAL7 a229168622pmid7 a10.1080/19440049.2012.7120612doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWaskiewicz, A.10aKinetics of fumonisin B1 formation in maize ears inoculated with Fusarium verticillioides  ap. 1752-1761.  a2019-12-05  aThe kinetics of fumonisin B₁ (FB₁) biosynthesis have been examined in ears of four botanical varieties Zea mays var. indentata, Zea mays var. indurata, Zea mays var. saccharata and Zea mays var. everta inoculated with F. verticillioides isolates at silking stage. The level of mycotoxin accumulated in kernels was correlated with sample harvest time (r = 0.73) and ergosterol content (r = 0.70). FB₁ biosynthesis was influenced by amylose, starch and moisture contents, which undergo dynamic changes during grain formation. A comparative analysis of ear infection rates and efficiency of FB₁ biosynthesis showed that these are separate characters and their expression could be independent.  aPublisher supplied data 3aharvest date 3acorrelation 3afumonisin B1 3abiosynthesis 3aseeds 3aamylose 3acorn ears 3aFusarium fujikuroi 3aZea mays subsp. mays 3aergosterol 2aAlgorithms 2aAmylosexmetabolism 2aCrops, Agriculturalxchemistryxgrowth & developmentxmetabolismxmicrobiology. 2aErgosterolxmetabolism 2aFood Contamination 2aFood Microbiology 2aFumonisinsxmetabolism 2aFusariumxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aKinetics 2aPlant Diseasesxmicrobiology 2aRegression Analysis 2aSeedsxchemistryxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aSpecies Specificity 2aStarchxmetabolism 2aWaterxanalysis 2aZea maysxchemistryxgrowth & developmentxmetabolismxmicrobiology. 0aPoland 0aHPLC 0aFusarium verticillioides 0amaize 0aGibberella fujikuroi 0afumonisins1 aWit, M.1 aGolinski, P.1 aChełkowski, J.,1 aWarzecha, R.1 aOchodzki, P.1 aWakulinski, W.0 tFood additives & contaminants.g2012 Nov. 1, v. 29, no. 11 p.1752-1761dTaylor & Francis Groupx1944-00577nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/19440049.2012.712061  aDNAL 7aarticle02566naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002300148245005200171300001400223520115200237592002801389650001301417650001301430650001501443650001201458650001901470650001501489650001101504650000701515650001701522650001601539650001801555653001801573653001201591653001501603653001601618653001801634653001401652653001201666653001801678653001301696653001801709700002401727700002401751700002001775700001501795700002501810773010901835856008301944852000902027655001202036IND60091628720221116144525.0210715e20130315xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009162872DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bios.2012.09.0292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDargaville, Tim R.10aSensors and imaging for wound healing: A review  ap. 30-42.  aWound healing involves a complex series of biochemical events and has traditionally been managed with ‘low tech’ dressings and bandages. The concept that diagnostic and theranostic sensors can complement wound management is rapidly growing in popularity as there is tremendous potential to apply this technology to both acute and chronic wounds. Benefits in sensing the wound environment include reduction of hospitalization time, prevention of amputations and better understanding of the processes which impair healing. This review discusses the state-of-the-art in detection of markers associated with wound healing and infection, utilizing devices imbedded within dressings or as point-of-care techniques to allow for continual or rapid wound assessment and monitoring. Approaches include using biological or chemical sensors of wound exudates and volatiles to directly or indirectly detect bacteria, monitor pH, temperature, oxygen and enzymes. Spectroscopic and imaging techniques are also reviewed as advanced wound monitoring techniques. The review concludes with a discussion of the limitations of and future directions for this field.  aPublisher supplied data 3abacteria 3abandages 3abiosensors 3aenzymes 3aimage analysis 3amonitoring 3aoxygen 3apH 3aspectroscopy 3atemperature 3atissue repair 0aWound healing 0aSensors 0aDiagnostic 0aTheranostic 0aChronic wound 0aInfection 0aImaging 0aPoint-of-care 0aDressing 0aSmart bandage1 aFarrugia, Brooke L.1 aBroadbent, James A.1 aPace, Stephanie1 aUpton, Zee1 aVoelcker, Nicolas H.0 tBiosensors & bioelectronics.g2013 Mar. 15, v. 41 p.30-42dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11631x0956-56637nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bios.2012.09.0293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02517naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001800149245009800167520131100265592002801576650002201604650001601626650002001642650001101662650001601673650001501689650002001704650002501724650001101749650000901760650001301769651001001782700001801792700001701810700002101827700002001848700001301868773013401881856008302015852000902098655001202107IND60751399220221120142457.0210925e20210914xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075139922DNAL7 a10.3390/agriculture110908782doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Xiuxue 10aIncreasing Snow–Soil Interface Temperature in Farmland of Northeast China from 1979 to 2018  aThe presence of seasonal snow cover in the cold season can significantly affect the thermal conditions of the ground. Understanding the change of the snow–soil interface temperature (TSS) and its environmental impact factors is essential for predicting subnivean species changes and carbon balance in future climatic conditions. An improved Snow Thermal Model (SNTHERM) is employed to quantify TSS in farmland of Northeast China (NEC) in a 39-year period (1979–2018) firstly. This study also explored the variation tendency of TSS and its main influencing factors on grid scale. The result shows that annual average TSS and the difference between TSS and air temperature (TDSSA) increased rapidly between 1979 and 2018 in the farmland of NEC, and we used the Mann–Kendall test to further verify the increasing trends of TSS and TDSSA on aggregated farmland of NEC. The correlation analysis showed that mean snow depth (MSD) is the most pivotal control factor in 95% of pixels and TDSSA increases as MSD increases. Snow depth can better predict the change of TSS in deep–snow regions than average winter temperature (TSA). The results of this study are of great significance for understanding the impact of snow cover on the energy exchange between the ground and the atmosphere in the cold climate.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural land 3aagriculture 3aair temperature 3acarbon 3acold season 3acold zones 3aenergy transfer 3aenvironmental impact 3amodels 3asnow 3asnowpack 3aChina1 aLi, Xiaofeng 1 aGu, Lingjia 1 aZheng, Xingming 1 aWang, Guangrui 1 aLi, Lei 0 tAgriculture (Basel).g2021 Sept. 14, v. 11, no. 9dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:12387x2077-04727nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agriculture110908783Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03059naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002100150245011800171300001600289520161100305592002801916650001201944650001601956650002301972650001901995650001302014650001702027650001702044650001602061650001202077650001602089653001602105653001902121653001102140653002002151653001702171700002002188700002002208700001902228700001902247700002202266700002002288700002302308700002102331773011902352856008502471852000902556655001202565IND60525850620221117203406.0180829e201604  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052585062DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbagen.2016.01.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRusciano, Giulia10aInsights into the interaction of the N-terminal amyloidogenic polypeptide of ApoA-I with model cellular membranes  ap. 795-801.  aAbout twenty variants of apolipoprotein A-I (ApoA-I) are associated to hereditary systemic amyloidoses. Although the molecular bases of this disease are still largely unknown, it has been hypothesized that ApoA-I proteolysis is a key event in pathogenesis, since it triggers the release of an N-terminal fragment (80–100 residue long) that misfolds to form amyloid deposits in peripheral organs and tissues. It is also known that cell membrane lipids play a key role in the fibrillogenic pathway. In the case of ApoA-I related amyloidosis caused by L174S mutation, the 93-residue N-terminal fragment of ApoA-I ([1-93]ApoA-I) was found to be the major constituent of ex vivo fibrils.With the main goal to investigate the interaction of either [1-93]ApoA-I and ApoA-I with biomimetic membranes, we set-up an experimental system based on the Raman Tweezers methodology. We tested GUVs composed by two types of zwitterionic lipids with a different fluidity degree, i.e. dioleoylphosphatidylcholine (DOPC) and dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC).We found that [1-93]ApoA-I induces conformational disorder in an ordered lipid bilayer. When interacting with fluid phases, instead, the fragment was found to be able to penetrate the membrane bilayer inducing an alignment of lipid chains.The interaction features of [1-93]ApoA-I with biomimetic membranes strongly depend on the lipid phase. Full-length ApoA-I was found to have similar effects, even if significantly less pronounced.Our observations shed light on still largely unknown molecular bases of ApoA-I fibrillogenic domain interaction with membranes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aamyloid 3aamyloidosis 3aapolipoprotein A-I 3alipid bilayers 3amutation 3apathogenesis 3apolypeptides 3aproteolysis 3atissues 3azwitterions 0aAmyloidosis 0aRaman tweezers 0aApoA-I 0aModel membranes 0aLipid phases1 aPesce, Giuseppe1 aZito, Gianluigi1 aSasso, Antonio1 aGaglione, Rosa1 aDel Giudice, Rita1 aPiccoli, Renata1 aMonti, Daria Maria1 aArciello, Angela0 tBiochimica et biophysica acta.g2016 Apr., v. 1860, no. 4 p.795-801dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11872x0304-41657nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbagen.2016.01.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02552naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001500150245015100165500001900316520108700335592002801422650002701450650001601477650001501493650001101508650001601519650001201535650002101547650001701568650001401585650001301599650001601612650001101628650001401639653000901653653002201662653002501684700005401709700001501763700001401778700001201792700002001804700001801824700001601842773010601858856008501964852000902049655001202058IND60700362820221119192805.0200824e202010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070036282DNAL7 a10.1016/j.micres.2020.1265282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYin, Kaiyu10aMviN mediates the regulation of environmental osmotic pressure on esrB to control the virulence in the marine fish pathogen Edwardsiella piscicida  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aEdwardsiella piscicida is a notorious pathogen infecting diverse kinds of fish and causes substantial economic losses in the global aquaculture industries. The EsrA-EsrB two-component system plays a critical role in the regulation of virulence genes expression, including type III and type VI secretion systems (T3/T6SSs). In this study, the putative regulators of esrB were screened by the transposon insertion sequencing (TIS) technology. As a result, MviN, a lipid II flippase, was identified as a modulator to upregulate esrB and downstream T3/T6SS gene expression in the earlier growth phases while downregulate esrB at the later stages. Complement or overexpression of the mviN restored the esrB as well as T3/T6SS expression in the ΔmviN mutant strain. Moreover, MviN also mediated the regulation of environmental osmotic pressure on the expression of esrB. MviN was also found to significantly influence the in vivo colonization of E. piscicida in turbot. Collectively, this study enhanced our understanding of pathogenesis and virulence regulatory network of E. piscicida.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEdwardsiella piscicida 3aaquaculture 3acomplement 3alipids 3amarine fish 3amutants 3aosmotic pressure 3apathogenesis 3apathogens 3aresearch 3atransposons 3aturbot 3avirulence 0aEsrB 0aLipid II flippase 0aIn vivo colonization1 aZhang, Jin1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1851-13031 aMa, Jiabao1 aJin, Peng1 aMa, Yue1 aZhang, Yuanxing1 aLiu, Xiaohong1 aWang, Qiyao0 tMicrobiological research.g2020 Oct., v. 239 p.126528-dElsevier GmbHwJournal:11955x0944-50137nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.micres.2020.1265283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01971naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245014600170300001600316520068900332592002801021650001201049650001301061650001201074650003301086650001801119650001301137650000901150650001901159650000901178650001201187650001201199651001001211653001201221653001601233653004401249653001301293700001901306700001701325773010201342856008401444852000901528655001201537IND60411438920221121200954.0150925e20151021xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6041143892DNAL7 a10.1080/01490451.2014.9816462doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGhatak, Saswati10aFirst-Order Assessment of the Influence of Three EPS and Calcite-Producing Microbes Isolated from a Cemented Sand Site on Soil Shear Strength  ap. 761-770.  aSubsurface geotechnical data from a cemented tailings sand site in eastern India indicated that the cementation was at least partially biogenic. Three strains of aerobic soil-residing bacteria from this site exhibited capabilities of producing extracellular polymeric substance, calcite and struvite when grown in minimal mineral salt media. These strains grew easily under a variety of physical, chemical and nutritional conditions. Drained triaxial testing of loose sand samples indicated that they became stronger upon hosting these strains. No details on EPS and calcite production of these isolates and the effects of these products on soil behavior were found in the literature.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaerobes 3abacteria 3acalcite 3amagnesium ammonium phosphate 3amine tailings 3asampling 3asand 3ashear strength 3asoil 3astrains 3atesting 3aIndia 0acalcite 0acementation 0aextracellular polymeric substance (EPS) 0astruvite1 aManna, Suvendu1 aRoy, Debasis0 tGeomicrobiology journal.g2015 Oct. 21, v. 32, no. 9 p.761-770dTaylor & Francisx1521-05297nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01490451.2014.9816463Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02003naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245010300167300001600270520093500286592002801221650002001249650002401269650001501293650001401308650001001322650002601332650001901358650001601377650001301393650001601406700002201422700002001444773008701464856008101551852000901632655001201641IND60573938420221123044445.0170725e201701  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057393842DNAL7 a10.1007/s00709-016-0974-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKinoshita, Nana10aChemotactic movement in sperm of the oogamous brown algae, Saccharina japonica and Fucus distichus  ap. 547-555.  aIn oogamous species of brown algae such as Saccharina japonica and Fucus distichus, the sperm possess an unusual long posterior flagellum, which oscillates actively and produces a propulsive force during swimming. In this study, we quantitatively analyzed the effect of chemotactic responses on sperm swimming and flagellar waveforms by high-speed video recordings. We found that the thigmotactic response to the chemo-attractant was not enhanced during chemotactic swimming and that the swimming velocity of sperm did not decrease. As concentration of the chemo-attractant decreased, the sperm performed drastic U-turn movements, which was caused by a rapid and large bend of the posterior flagellum. Unilateral bending of the posterior flagellum when sensing a decrease in the concentration of the chemo-attractant may be a common response in male gametes during fertilization of brown algae both oogamous and isogamous species.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFucus distichus 3aSaccharina japonica 3achemotaxis 3aflagellum 3amales 3aquantitative analysis 3asperm motility 3aspermatozoa 3aswimming 3athigmotaxis1 aNagasato, Chikako1 aMotomura, Taizo0 tProtoplasma.g2017 Jan., v. 254, no. 1 p.547-555dSpringer Viennax0033-183X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00709-016-0974-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01814naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100001800112245008400130300001800214520079100232592002801023650000901051650001001060650002201070650001501092650001401107650002301121650001801144650001901162650002801181651001001209653001701219653001201236653002001248700002301268773015201291852000901443655001201452IND60705776520221120182506.0200807e201503  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070577652DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aManish Kumar,10aOrganic Soil and Sustainable Agriculture: Needs and Prospects in India-A Review  ap. 1143-1147.  aThis review paper attempts to bring together different issues in the light of recent developments in organic farming. Adequate levels of soil fertility and plant nutrients are important to farming, whether the practices are considered “conventional” or “sustainable.” India has traditionally been a country of organic agriculture, but the growth of modern scientific, input intensive agriculture has pushed it to wall. But with the increasing awareness about the safety and quality of foods, long term sustainability of the system and accumulating evidences of being equally productive, the organic farming has emerged as an alternative system of farming which not only address the quality and sustainability concerns, but also ensures a debt free, profitable livelihood option.  aPublisher supplied data 3adebt 3afoods 3aintensive farming 3alivelihood 3anutrients 3aorganic production 3aorganic soils 3asoil fertility 3asustainable agriculture 3aIndia 0aconventional 0aquality 0aorganic farming1 aṬān̲yā, Kō.,0 tTrends in Biosciences.g2015 Mar., v. 8, no. 5 p.1143-1147dSociety for Advancement of Science and Rural DevelopmentwJournal:2106x0976-24857nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle02647naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100001500142245010300157300001800260520112600278592002801404650002601432650001201458650002201470650001501492650004401507650000901551700001501560700001301575700001501588700005201603700002301655700002401678700001601702700001801718700005901736700001701795700005401812700001801866700001701884700005601901773014701957856007602104852000902180655001202189IND60603086120221121211601.0180712e20170621xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060308612DNAL7 a10.1021/jacs.7b013262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Zhe10aSupersnowflakes: Stepwise Self-Assembly and Dynamic Exchange of Rhombus Star-Shaped Supramolecules  ap. 8174-8185.  aWith the goal of increasing the complexity of metallo-supramolecules, two rhombus star-shaped supramolecular architectures, namely, supersnowflakes, were designed and assembled using multiple 2,2′:6′,2″-terpyridine (tpy) ligands in a stepwise manner. In the design of multicomponent self-assembly, ditopic and tritopic ligands were bridged through Ru(II) with strong coordination to form metal–organic ligands for the subsequent self-assembly with a hexatopic ligand and Zn(II). The combination of Ru(II)–organic ligands with high stability and Zn(II) ions with weak coordination played a key role in the self-assembly of giant heteroleptic supersnowflakes, which encompassed three types of tpy-based organic ligands and two metal ions. With such a stepwise strategy, the self-sorting of individual building blocks was prevented from forming the undesired assemblies, e.g., small macrocycles and coordination polymers. Furthermore, the intra- and intermolecular dynamic exchange study of two supersnowflakes by NMR and mass spectrometry revealed the remarkable stability of these giant supramolecular complexes.  aPublisher supplied data 3acoordination polymers 3aligands 3amass spectrometry 3ametal ions 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3azinc1 aWang, Heng1 aWang, Xu1 aLi, Yiming1 aSong, Bo1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4337-848X1 aBolarinwa, Olapeju1 aReese, R.

Fire can be a significant driver of forest composition and structure change, but identifying and quantifying fire regimes has been elusive. Using high-resolution charcoal analysis and pollen analysis we reconstructed a 13,200-year-old fire and vegetation history from Breitenbush Lake, Oregon, located in the central Cascade Range, USA. Our objective was to examine if fire occurrence and severity may have been a driver of Holocene forest-composition change. The data from this study suggests that while fire can create opportunities for successional process to occur, fire events were not significant catalysts for forest change. Instead, most major transitions at Breitenbush Lake occurred during prolonged fire-free intervals. Our results reinforce the view that climate is the major control of vegetation composition change in the Cascade Range.  aPublisher supplied data 3abotanical composition 3acatalysts 3acharcoal 3aclimate 3afire regime 3aforests 3alakes 3apaleoecology 3apollen 3aCascade Mountain region 3aOregon 0aCascade Range 0aEnvironmental change 0aPacific Northwest 0aVegetation history 0aFire history 0aFire severity 0aSubalpine Forest1 aLong, Colin J.0 tQuaternary Research.g2016 Mar., v. 85 p.211-217dElsevier Inc.aUniversity of Washingtonx0033-58947nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.yqres.2015.12.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03273naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001500147245012200162300001600284520198600300592002802286650002702314650001402341650002302355650001302378650001902391650001302410650002102423650001802444650000902462650002102471651001002492700001802502700001502520700001802535700001402553700001602567700001402583773009602597852000902693856008102702930003302783946001102816655001202827IND60439934520221121223936.0151024e200805  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6043993452DNAL7 a10.1007/s11104-008-9575-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Wei10aEmissions of nitrous oxide from three tropical forests in Southern China in response to simulated nitrogen deposition  ap. 221-236.  aEmissions of nitrous oxide (N₂O) from the soil following simulated nitrogen (N) deposition in a disturbed (pine), a rehabilitated (pine and broadleaf mixed) and a mature (monsoon evergreen broadleaf) tropical forest in southern China were studied. The following hypotheses were tested: (1) addition of N will increase soil N₂O emission in tropical forests; and (2) any observed increase will be more pronounced in the mature forest than in the disturbed or rehabilitated forest due to the relatively high initial soil N concentration in the mature forest. The experiment was designed with four N treatment levels (three replicates; 0, 50, 100, 150 kg N ha⁻¹ year⁻¹ for C (Control), LN (Low-N), MN (Medium-N), and HN (High-N) treatment, respectively) in the mature forest, but only three levels in the disturbed and rehabilitated forests (C, LN and MN). Between October 2005 to September 2006, soil N₂O flux was measured using static chamber and gas chromatography methodology. Nitrogen had been applied previously to the plots since July 2003 and continued during soil N₂O flux measurement period. The annual mean rates of soil N₂O emission in the C plots were 24.1 ± 1.5, 26.2 ± 1.4, and 29.3 ± 1.6 μg N₂O-N m⁻² h⁻¹ in the disturbed, rehabilitated and mature forest, respectively. There was a significant increase in soil N₂O emission following N additions in the mature forest (38%, 41%, and 58% when compared to the C plots for the LN, MN, and HN plots, respectively). In the disturbed forest a significant increase (35%) was observed in the MN plots, but not in the LN plots. The rehabilitated forest showed no significant response to N additions. Increases in soil N₂O emission occurred primarily in the cool-dry season (November, December and January). Our results suggest that the response of soil N₂O emission to N deposition in tropical forests in southern China may vary depending on the soil N status and land-use history of the forest.  aPublisher supplied data 3abroadleaved evergreens 3aemissions 3agas chromatography 3aland use 3amonsoon season 3anitrogen 3anitrogen content 3anitrous oxide 3asoil 3atropical forests 3aChina1 aMo, Jiangming1 aYu, Guirui1 aFang, Yunting1 aLi, Dejun1 aLu, Xiankai1 aWang, Hui0 tPlant and soil.g2008 May, v. 306, no. 1-2 p.221-236dSpringer Netherlandsx0032-079X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11104-008-9575-73Available from publisher's site  a20080421b20080502c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02933naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245014200165520136800307592002801675650003801703650001801741650001001759650002901769650001201798650001201810650001301822650002101835650001601856650001801872650001601890650001601906650001101922650004301933650001301976650001501989650001802004650001102022650002302033650001302056650001602069650001002085650001402095700001902109700001702128700002702145700001702172773012302189856008202312852000902394655001202403IND60771398020221119193000.0220325e20220312xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077139802DNAL7 a10.3390/pathogens110303472doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAin, Qurat Ul10aAntimicrobial Activity of Pinus wallachiana Leaf Extracts against Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. cubense and Analysis of Its Fractions by HPLC  aFusarium wilt has ruined banana production and poses a major threat to its industry because of highly virulent Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. cubense (Foc) race 4. The present study focused on the efficacy of Pinus wallachiana leaf extracts and its organic fractions against Foc in in vitro and greenhouse experiments. The presence of polyphenols in the fractions was also investigated using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The in vitro tests carried out for the leaf extract of P. wallachiana showed its inhibitory effect on the mycelial growth and, based on this evidence, further characterization of fractions were done. Complete mycelial inhibition and the highest zone of inhibition against Foc was observed for the n-butanol fraction in vitro, while the n-hexane and dichloromethane fractions showed lower disease severity index (DSI) in greenhouse experiments. The fractions were further analysed by HPLC using nine polyphenolic standards, namely quercitin, myrecitin, kaempferol, rutin, gallic acid, trans-ferulic acid, coumeric acid, epicatechin and catechin. The highest content of polyphenols, based on standards used, was quantified in the n-butanol fraction followed by the ethyl acetate fraction of the leaf extract. This is the first report of antimicrobial activity of Pinus wallachiana extracts against Foc to the best of our knowledge.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFusarium oxysporum f. sp. cubense 3aFusarium wilt 3aPinus 3aantimicrobial properties 3abananas 3abutanol 3acatechin 3adisease severity 3aepicatechin 3aethyl acetate 3agallic acid 3agreenhouses 3ahexane 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3aindustry 3akaempferol 3aleaf extracts 3aleaves 3amethylene chloride 3amycelium 3apolyphenols 3arutin 3avirulence1 aAsad, Shahzad 1 aAhad, Karam 1 aSafdar, Muhammad Naeem1 aJamal, Atif 0 tPathogens.g2022 Mar. 12, v. 11, no. 3dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27146x2076-08177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/pathogens110303473Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02642naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245012100168300001800289500001900307520137900326592002801705650001501733650001101748650002401759650001601783650001701799650002201816650001601838650001201854650001901866650002101885650004301906650000901949700002501958700001801983773015302001856008102154852000902235655001202244IND60725642420221118020731.0210128e202012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072564242DNAL7 a10.1134/S10623590201100232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAbdullaev, S.

The structural and functional disturbances induced by radiation in these organelles influence post-radiation development in a whole complex of effects at the cellular and whole organism level in animals and humans. This study is aimed at determining changes in the number of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) copies relative to nuclear DNA (nDNA) and identifying mutant copies of mtDNA in three brain regions (in the hippocampus, cortex, and cerebellum) of rats, at different times after cranial proton impact. Real-time PCR and a method of cleavage of mtDNA PCR amplicon heteroduplexes with Surveyor nuclease were used in this study. We revealed that after the proton exposure, the level of the mtDNA copy content in three brain regions of rats drastically increased with a simultaneous increase in the percentage of mutant mtDNA copies. The results obtained indicate that mtDNA synthesis and the level of its mutant copies differ in the hippocampus, cortex, and cerebellum of rats after cranial exposure to protons.

Based on the X-ray absorption coefficients and gray levels of the XM images, the OC content of EPS-covered cells of Synechococcus sp. (0.39–0.47 pg/cell) was found to be 2.0–2.4 times larger than that of EPS-removed cells (0.20 pg/cell).

Endophytes, fungi and bacteria that live within plant hosts without impacting the host negatively, have exhibited antagonism to V. dahliae. The objectives of this study were to survey potential V. dahliae-antagonistic endophytes from roots of ‘Cinnamon Girl’ pumpkin (Cucurbita pepo) grown under either polyethylene (PE), an experimental polylactic acid/ poly(hydroxalkanoate) (PLA/PHA) mulch, Weed Guard Plus, or no mulch, as well as from ‘Sugar Baby’ watermelon (Citrullus lanatus), and ‘Tetsukabuto’ squash (C. maxima x C. moschata). Four selected endophytes were screened for antagonism against V. dahliae in the laboratory, greenhouse, and field.A total of 777 isolates of potential fungal endophytes were recovered from pumpkin, watermelon, and squash roots between 2015 and 2016 of which 198 isolates were identified down to the genus level. Of those isolates, frequency of isolation was greatest for Dichotomopilus/Chaetomium spp. (5%), Cladosporium spp. (15.2 %), Clonostachys spp. (5.6 %), Epicoccum spp. (22.2 %), and Fusarium spp. (24.7 %). All five genera only weakly associated with roots grown under a particular mulch treatment (Cramer's V = 0.22) or cucurbit host (Cramer’s V = 0.1925). In a laboratory culture plate assay, V. dahliae isolate JAW-113 was plated against one of four prospective endophytes (Dichotomopilus sp., Epicoccum sp., Microdochium sp., or Schizothecium sp.). The area under the Verticillium culture growth curve (AUVGC) was significantly highest (P < 0.0001) when V. dahliae was by Schizothecium sp. or Dichotomopilus sp. In a greenhouse study using a Mason jar assay with V. dahliae amended potting mix, pumpkin plant vigor, plant fresh weight, root fresh weight, and root dry weight were significantly higher (P < 0.05) for plants inoculated with Dichotomopilus sp., Epicoccum sp., Microdochium sp., and Schizothecium sp. compared to plants without endophyte inoculation. Subsequent field trials in 2017 and 2018 showed no significant differences in foliar disease severity or fruit yield, regardless of whether plants were inoculated with an endophyte or not. However, recovery of V. dahliae colony forming units from pumpkin stem sap was significantly lower (P < 0.0001) for plants inoculated with either Dichotomopilus sp. or Schizothecium sp. in 2017 or Dichotomopilus sp. in 2018.  aPublisher supplied data  cNational Institute of Food and Agriculturedhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100005825  cUSDAdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/1000001990 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aChaetomium 3aCitrullus lanatus 3aCladosporium 3aClonostachys 3aCucurbita pepo 3aEpicoccum 3aFusarium 3aMicrodochium 3aVerticillium dahliae 3aantagonism 3adisease severity 3aendophytes 3afoliar diseases 3afruit yield 3afungi 3agreenhouse experimentation 3agreenhouses 3agrowth curves 3amulches 3amulching 3apathogens 3apolyethylene 3apumpkins 3aresearch 3asap 3asoil fumigation 3asquashes 3avigor 3awatermelons 3aweeds 0aEndophyte 0aBiodegradable mulch 0aBiological control1 aMorgan, Paul1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6319-88921 aGundersen, Babette1 aInglis, Debra Ann0 tMicrobiological research.g2020 Nov., v. 240 p.126535-dElsevier GmbHwJournal:11955x0944-50137nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.micres.2020.1265353Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02968naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002700148245007200175300001600247520150700263592002801770650002301798650002001821650001401841650001101855650001401866650002301880650001401903650002501917650001301942653002401955653002101979653002002000653004102020653001302061653002102074700006302095700002202158700001702180700002302197700002302220700001902243700002102262773011102283856008302394852000902477655001202486IND60751907420221122072953.0211227e202112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075190742DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jglr.2021.08.0242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMateus, Catarina Sofia10aPopulation structure in anadromous lampreys: Patterns and processes  ap. S38-S58.  aPopulation structure can reveal the diversity, gene flow, and dispersal of a species. This information can be used to make management decisions and reveal fundamental aspects of an organism’s biology. Distinct intrinsic (e.g., biological characteristics) and extrinsic (e.g., geographical and historical events, environment, human pressures) factors can influence population structure, with significant differences among species. However, detection of population structure in migratory lamprey species can be difficult to detect due to their lack of natal homing; this is particularly the case for anadromous lampreys, with their potential for wide dispersal at sea during their parasitic feeding stage. We review phenotypic and genetic markers, as well as the methods that have been used to assess population structure in lampreys, and discuss the relative strengths and limitations of each. Structure has been detected in several anadromous species using some of these methods, even without homing in these species, but we briefly contrast the weak population structure observed in anadromous species with the stronger structure observed in freshwater-resident lamprey species (particularly non-migratory brook lampreys). We relate lamprey population structure to species-specific ecological traits, such as juvenile dispersal tendencies, and provide case studies of six species. Delineation of appropriate management units in migratory lamprey species is important for conservation and management.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPetromyzontiformes 3aanadromous fish 3agene flow 3ahumans 3ajuveniles 3amigratory behavior 3aphenotype 3apopulation structure 3aresearch 0aAnadromous lampreys 0aDispersal at sea 0aLife strategies 0aBiological and environmental factors 0aPanmixia 0aLocal adaptation1 aDocker, Margaret F.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7878-73471 aEvanno, Guillaume1 aHess, Jon E.1 aHume, John Breslin1 aOliveira, Inês C.1 aSouissi, Ahmed1 aSutton, Trent M.0 tJournal of Great Lakes research.g2021 Dec., v. 47 p.S38-S58dElsevier B.V.wJournal:2035x0380-13307nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jglr.2021.08.0243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02263naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002300147245009800170520108700268592002801355650001301383650001601396650002101412650001601433650001101449650002001460650001401480650001501494650001101509650001401520650001801534650001301552650001301565700002101578700002701599700002501626773012301651856008201774852000901856655001201865IND60771398120221119193128.0220325e20220223xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077139812DNAL7 a10.3390/pathogens110302852doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCavallero, Serena 10aWhat Do In Vitro and In Vivo Models Tell Us about Anisakiasis? New Tools Still to Be Explored  aAnisakiasis is a zoonosis caused by the ingestion of raw or undercooked seafood infected with third-stage larvae (L3) of the marine nematode Anisakis. Based on L3 localization in human accidental hosts, gastric, intestinal or ectopic (extra-gastrointestinal) anisakiasis can occur, in association with mild to severe symptoms of an allergic nature. Given the increasing consumption of fish worldwide, the European Food Safety Authority declared Anisakis as an emerging pathogen. Despite its importance for public health and economy, the scientific literature is largely characterized by taxonomic, systematic and ecological studies, while investigations on clinical aspects, such as the inflammatory and immune response during anisakiasis, using a proper model that simulates the niche of infection are still very scarce. The aims of this review are to describe the clinical features of anisakiasis, to report the main evidence from the in vivo and in vitro studies carried out to date, highlighting limitations, and to propose future perspectives in the study field of anisakiasis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAnisakis 3aanisakiasis 3afish consumption 3afood safety 3ahumans 3aimmune response 3aingestion 3aintestines 3amodels 3apathogens 3apublic health 3aseafoods 3azoonoses1 aBellini, Ilaria 1 aPizzarelli, Antonella 1 aD’Amelio, Stefano 0 tPathogens.g2022 Feb. 23, v. 11, no. 3dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27146x2076-08177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/pathogens110302853Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02418naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245012300167300001800290500001900308520126100327592002801588650001801616650001601634650001601650650001001666650000901676650001701685650001801702650001201720650001101732700002001743700001901763700001901782773015301801856008101954852000902035655001202044IND60725642520221118020553.0210128e202012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072564252DNAL7 a10.1134/S10623590201101512doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTolstykh, E.

Accidental contamination of the Techa River (Chelyabinsk Oblast) in 1950s with bone-seeking long-lived strontium-90 gave an opportunity to evaluate the effect of local red bone marrow (RBM) exposure on translocation formation in the peripheral T-lymphocytes of local inhabitants. The studies of the inhabitants using fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) showed that RBM doses calculated based on FISH results were lower than those estimated based on ⁹⁰Sr body burden measurements. The current study presents analytical review of the published data dealing with the most important processes of the T-lymphocyte development and formation of chromosome aberrations: characteristics of the main compartments where the exposure of T-cell occurs; assessment of the time spent by T-lymphocytes and their progenitors in these compartments; analysis of the dynamics of T-cell populations (proliferation and death); age-related aspects. The paper presents a concept of T-cell Genus (TG) united all the progeny of T progenitor with inheritable specific aberrations that could have developed in bone marrow.  aPublisher supplied data 3aT-lymphocytes 3abone marrow 3achromosomes 3adeath 3afish 3afluorescence 3ahybridization 3aprogeny 3arivers1 aVozilova, A.

It prefers the shady valleys and northward facing slopes of limestone ridges in mountain zones with high average humidity. Nevertheless, it can be found rarely on rocks directly exposed to the sunlight, without the coverage of the canopy. In the present study, we follow the alterations in the subcellular organization of mesophyll cells and sugar metabolism upon desiccation of shade and sun H. rhodopensis plants. Composition and content of soluble carbohydrates during desiccation and rehydration were different in plants grown below the trees or on the sunny rocks. Sucrose, however, was dominating in both ecotypes. The amount of starch grains in chloroplasts was inversely related to that of sugars. Concomitantly with these changes, the number of vacuoles was multiplied in the cells. This can be explained by the development of small (secondary) vacuoles peripherally in the cytoplasm, rather than by the fragmentation of the single vacuole, proposed earlier in the literature. Accordingly, the centripetal movement of chloroplasts and other organelles may be a result of the dynamic changes in the vacuolar system. Upon rehydration, the inner vacuoles enlarged and the organelles returned to their normal position.  aPublisher supplied data 3acanopy 3achlorophyll 3achloroplasts 3adrought tolerance 3aecotypes 3ahumidity 3alimestone 3amesophyll 3ametabolism 3arehydration 3asolar radiation 3astarch granules 3asucrose 3atrees 3avacuoles 3avalleys1 aRapparini, F.1 aBertazza, G.1 aMihailova, G.1 aSárvári, É.1 aSolti, Á.1 aKeresztes, Á.0 tProtoplasma.g2017 Jan., v. 254, no. 1 p.193-201dSpringer Viennax0033-183X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00709-015-0932-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03366naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002100151245015200172300001600324520162000340592002801960650002501988650001302013650001302026650001902039650001802058650001202076650001102088650001802099650001702117650002202134650000902156650002002165650001802185650001502203650001402218650001802232650003402250650001102284650000802295650001302303650001502316651001702331653001302348653002502361653002702386653003302413653002502446653001102471653003702482700003602519700002502555773010202580856008502682852000902767655001202776IND60411439320221117181744.0150925e20151021xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6041143932DNAL7 a10.1080/01490451.2015.10107542doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAbo-Amer, Aly E.10aIsolation and Molecular Characterization of Heavy Metal-Resistant Alcaligenes faecalis from Sewage Wastewater and Synthesis of Silver Nanoparticles  ap. 836-845.  aEnvironmental pollution with toxic heavy metals is increasing throughout the world alongside industrial development. Microorganisms and microbial products can be highly efficient bioaccumulators of soluble and particulate forms of metals, especially dilute external solutions. Microbe related technologies (Biotechnology) may provide an alternative or additive conventional method for metal removal or metal recovery. This study dealt with isolation, identification and characterization of heavy metal-resistant (Pb ²⁺, Cd ²⁺, Al ³⁺, Cu ²⁺, Ag ²⁺ and Sn ²⁺) bacteria from sewage wastewater at Taif Province, Saudi Arabia. Nine bacterial isolates were selected by using an enrichment isolation procedure based on high level of heavy metal resistance. All the isolates showed high resistance to heavy metals with Minimum Inhibitor Concentration (MIC) ranging from 800 μg/ml to 1400 μg/ml. All nine resistant isolates showed multiple tolerances to heavy metals. On the basis of morphological, biochemical and 16S rRNA characterization, the most potent isolates (Cd1-1, Ag1-1, Ag1-3 and Sn1-1) were identified as Alcaligenes faecalis . Scanning electron microscope analysis showed that the morphology of Alcaligenes faecalis Ag1-1 was unchanged after growth in medium without and with addition of Ag ²⁺ indicative Ag ²⁺ is not toxic to the isolate under the conditions tested. The ability of Alcaligenes faecalis Ag1-1 to synthesize sliver nanoparticles was examined. The heavy metal-resistant bacteria obtained could be useful for the bioremediation of heavy metal-contaminated environment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAlcaligenes faecalis 3aaluminum 3abacteria 3abioremediation 3abiotechnology 3acadmium 3acopper 3aculture media 3aheavy metals 3aindustrialization 3alead 3ametal tolerance 3ananoparticles 3ananosilver 3apollution 3aribosomal RNA 3ascanning electron microscopes 3asewage 3atin 3atoxicity 3awastewater 3aSaudi Arabia 0a16S rRNA 0aAlcaligenes faecalis 0aheavy metal resistance 0ascanning electron microscope 0asilver nanoparticles 0asewage 0atransmission electron microscope1 aEl-Shanshoury, Abd El-Raheem R.1 aAlzahrani, Othman M.0 tGeomicrobiology journal.g2015 Oct. 21, v. 32, no. 9 p.836-845dTaylor & Francisx1521-05297nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01490451.2015.10107543Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02690naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100001800112245014300130300001800273520127900291592002801570650002701598650002301625650001001648650001401658650002401672650002201696650001301718650001701731650001201748650001501760650001801775650001401793650001601807650001801823650002301841650002201864650002101886653002201907653001601929653003401945700001701979700001701996700001702013700001702030773015202047852000902199655001202208IND60705777020221121055716.0200807e201503  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070577702DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aParmar, M.

The experimental material comprised of 60 Bt cotton hybrids of various seed companies, and experiment was laid out in randomized complete block design with three replications at the Regional Research Station, Anand Agricultural University, Anand during Kharif-2012. The genotypes showed a wide range of variability for all the characters. The characters lint yield, days to 50% flowering, number of bolls per plant, number of monopodia per plant, number of sympodia per plant and boll weight showed positive and significant correlation with seed cotton yield at genotypic and phenotypic level. The path analysis revealed that lint yield, number of bolls per plant, number of monopodia per plant, boll weight and days to 50% flowering excreted high and positive direct effect on seed cotton yield at both genotypic and phenotypic levels. Seed cotton yield, lint yield, days to 50% flowering and ginning per cent had moderate to high heritability estimates coupled with high genetic advance. It is suggested that these characters could be considered as selection criteria in improvement of seed cotton yield of G. hirsutum.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacillus thuringiensis 3aGossypium hirsutum 3abolls 3aflowering 3agenetic improvement 3agenetic variation 3agenotype 3aheritability 3ahybrids 3alint yield 3apath analysis 3aphenotype 3aseed cotton 3aseed industry 3aselection criteria 3atransgenic plants 3ayield components 0aBt Cotton hybrids 0aCorrelation 0aPath analysis and Variability1 aPatel, S.

Imaging has a pivotal role in monitoring disease activity, with 18-fluoro-deoxyglucose positron emission and computed tomography (18F-FDG-PET/CT) in particular having proven beneficial for assessing disease activity. Repetitive regular examinations to monitor therapy response, however, can lead to substantial radiation burden. Therefore, by combining metabolic information and excellent tissue contrast in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), PET/MR appears ideally suited for this task. Here, we retrospectively analyzed 51 AE patients that underwent 18F-FDG-PET/MR. Patients had a ‘confirmed/probable’ diagnosis in 22/29 cases according to the WHO classification. FDG uptake, diffusion restriction, and MRI morphology were evaluated. We found significant differences in FDG uptake between responders to benzimidazole therapy and progressive manifestations (SUVavg 2.7 ± 1.3 vs. 5.4 ± 2.2, p < 0.001) as well as between Kodama Types 1 and 3 (F = 9.9, p < 0.003). No significant differences were detected for ADC values or MRI morphology concerning response and no correlations were present between FDG uptake and ADC values. The mean radiation dose was 5.9–6.5 mSv. We conclude that the combination of metabolic information and MRI morphology at a low radiation dose proposes PET/MR as a suitable imaging modality for AE assessment. Longitudinal studies are needed to define the role of this imaging modality.  aPublisher supplied data 3abenzimidazole 3acomputed tomography 3adisease control 3aechinococcosis 3aelectrons 3amagnetism 3atherapeutics1 aPeters, Lynn 1 aKapp-Schwoerer, Silke 1 aBeer, Meinrad 1 aBeer, Ambros J.1 aGrüner, Beate 1 aThaiss, Wolfgang M.0 tPathogens.g2022 Mar. 12, v. 11, no. 3dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27146x2076-08177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/pathogens110303483Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03283naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002700143245011200170300001600282506002800298520179200326592002802118506003702146650001202183650001702195650001702212650001802229650001402247650002302261650001102284650002602295650002102321650002502342650001302367650002002380650002302400650000702423650001602430650001302446700002702459700003202486700001502518700001702533700001702550773013502567856007802702852000902780655001202789IND60785358020221207050128.0161219e201612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078535802DNAL7 a10.15835/nbha442103322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTUDOR-RADU, Mădălina10aAssessment of Ascorbic Acid, Polyphenols, Flavonoids, Anthocyanins and Carotenoids Content in Tomato Fruits  ap. 477-483.  aResource is Open Access  aThe increased interest in organic tomatoes production demands breeders to develop new cultivars, which besides suitability in low-input production system and marketable quality, have to exhibit high nutritional value, including health-promoting compounds. In this respect, this paper aimed to assess and compare the nutritional value of four Romanian tomato cultivars, two with determinate growth (‘Argeș 11’ and ‘Argeș 123’) and two with indeterminate growth (‘Costate 21’ and ‘Ștefănești 22’), created and recommended for organic production in open field and protected cultivation. The tomato cultivars were laid out in a high plastic tunnel crop and the tomato fruits were evaluated as chemical composition, being determined the following parameters: moisture, ash, soluble solids, pH, acidity and content in some antioxidant compounds, such as vitamin C, polyphenols, flavonoids, anthocyanins, lycopene and β-carotene. Considering some chemical parameters important in revealing tomato flavor, such as soluble solids, pH and acidity, ‘Ștefănești 22’ cultivar showed the best ratio among them. The differences in antioxidant composition among cultivars were not statistically significant (P>0.05) for most of the analyzed parameters, with the exception of lycopene content which showed significant variation. Thus, ‘Costate 21’ showed the highest amount of lycopene within indeterminate cultivars (17.49 mg 100 g-1 FW), while ‘Argeș 11’ showed the highest amount of lycopene within determinate cultivars (13.92 mg 100 g-1 FW). According to the nutritional value of cultivars assessed in this study, ‘Costate 21’ is the best recommendation for greenhouse cultivation while ‘Argeș 11’ is the best recommendation for open field cultivation.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aacidity 3aanthocyanins 3aantioxidants 3aascorbic acid 3acultivars 3adeterminate growth 3aflavor 3agreenhouse production 3ahealth promotion 3aindeterminate growth 3alycopene 3anutritive value 3aorganic production 3apH 3apolyphenols 3atomatoes1 aVÎJAN, Loredana Elena1 aTUDOR-RADU, Cristinel Mihai1 aTIŢA, Ion1 aSIMA, Rodica1 aMITREA, Rodi0 tNotulae botanicae Horti Agrobotanici Cluj-Napoca.g2016 Dec., v. 44, no. 2 p.477-483dAcademicPreswJournal:21431x1842-43097nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.15835/nbha442103323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02240naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100002100142245009800163300001800261520102200279592002801301650001201329650002101341650002101362650001901383650003101402650001301433650001901446650001201465700002601477700001801503700006401521700006101585773014701646856007601793852000901869655001201878IND60603086520180905000000.0180712e20170628xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060308652DNAL7 a10.1021/jacs.7b015872doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMartinić, Ivana10aNear-Infrared Optical Imaging of Necrotic Cells by Photostable Lanthanide-Based Metallacrowns  ap. 8388-8391.  aSensitive detection of cell necrosis is crucial for the determination of cell viability. Because of its high resolution at the cellular level and sensitivity, optical imaging is highly attractive for identifying cell necrosis. However, challenges associated with this technique remain present such as the rapid photobleaching of several types of organic fluorophores and/or the interference generated by biological autofluorescence. Herein, we synthesized novel biologically compatible Zn²⁺/Ln³⁺ metallacrowns (MCs) that possess attractive near-infrared (NIR) emission and are highly photostable. In addition, these MCs have the ability to label differentially necrotic HeLa cells from living cells. This work is also the first demonstration of (i) the use of the NIR emission arising from a single lanthanide(III) cation for optical biological imaging of cells under single photon excitation, (ii) the first example of a lanthanide(III)-based NIR-emitting probe that can be targeted to a specific type of cell.  aPublisher supplied data 3acations 3afluorescent dyes 3ahuman cell lines 3aimage analysis 3anear-infrared spectroscopy 3anecrosis 3aphotobleaching 3aphotons1 aEliseeva, Svetlana V.1 aNguyen, Tu N.1 aPecoraro, Vincent L.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1540-57351 aPetoud, Stéphane1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4659-45050 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2017 June 28, v. 139, no. 25 p.8388-8391dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19166x1520-51267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jacs.7b015873Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01976naa a2200253 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001900145245003600164300001300200520119300213592002801406650001601434650001301450650001501463651001801478773012601496856007901622852000901701655001201710IND60300881620221122221528.0150703e20130301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6030088162DNAL7 a10.1126/science.12368312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlberts, Bruce10aWhy National Science Academies?  ap. 1011.  aNext Week Marks the 150th Anniversary of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States. In the midst of the Civil War, a bill introduced by Congressman Henry Wilson of Massachusetts was passed on 3 March 1863 and signed into law by President Abraham Lincoln the same day. The Academy's charter thus created stipulated that a new Academy, formed by a group of not more than 50 of the nation's best scientists, "… shall, whenever called upon by any department of the Government, investigate, examine, experiment, and report upon any subject of science or art … but the Academy shall receive no compensation whatever for any services to the Government of the United States." Lacking funds, the new Academy got off to a very shaky start. But today it thrives as part of the influential National Academies, the name given to the expanded institution that now includes the National Research Council, the National Academy of Engineering, and the Institute of Medicine. Why has this organization prospered and grown over the course of the past 150 years? Critical to success is its unique mission to provide independent, evidence-based scientific advice to the nation's policy-makers.  aPublisher supplied data 3aengineering 3amedicine 3ascientists 3aMassachusetts0 tScience.g2013 Mar. 1, v. 339, no. 6123 p.1011-1011dAmerican Association for the Advancement of Sciencex0036-80757nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.12368313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02797naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002300149245015900172300001600331520139000347592002801737650002201765650001701787650001901804650001401823650001501837650001001852650001001862650001001872650001301882650001101895650002001906650002301926650001101949650001101960651001301971653000801984653002501992653002102017653002502038653001102063653001302074700002502087773011102112856008302223852000902306655001202315IND60562360120221122233830.0170719e201603  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056236012DNAL7 a10.1016/j.yqres.2016.01.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFeranec, Robert S.10aImplications of a Bayesian radiocarbon calibration of colonization ages for mammalian megafauna in glaciated New York State after the Last Glacial Maximum  ap. 262-270.  aTo understand what factors control species colonization and extirpation within specific paleoecosystems, we analyzed radiocarbon dates of megafaunal mammal species from New York State after the Last Glacial Maximum. We hypothesized that the timing of colonization and extirpation were both driven by access to preferred habitat types. Bayesian calibration of a database of 39 radiocarbon dates shows that caribou (Rangifer tarandus) were the first colonizers, then mammoth (Mammuthus sp.), and finally American mastodon (Mammut americanum). The timing of colonization cannot reject the hypothesis that colonizing megafauna tracked preferred habitats, as caribou and mammoth arrived when tundra was present, while mastodon arrived after boreal forest was prominent in the state. The timing of caribou colonization implies that ecosystems were developed in the state prior to 16,000calyr BP. The contemporaneous arrival of American mastodon with Sporormiella spore decline suggests the dung fungus spore is not an adequate indicator of American mastodon population size. The pattern in the timing of extirpation is opposite to that of colonization. The lack of environmental changes suspected to be ecologically detrimental to American mastodon and mammoth coupled with the arrival of humans shortly before extirpation suggests an anthropogenic cause in the loss of the analyzed species.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRangifer tarandus 3aSporormiella 3aboreal forests 3adatabases 3aecosystems 3afauna 3afeces 3afungi 3ahabitats 3ahumans 3apopulation size 3aradiocarbon dating 3aspores 3atundra 3aNew York 0a14C 0aBayesian calibration 0aHabitat tracking 0aLast Glacial Maximum 0aMammal 0aNew York1 aKozlowski, Andrew L.0 tQuaternary Research.g2016 Mar., v. 85 p.262-270dElsevier Inc.aUniversity of Washingtonx0033-58947nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.yqres.2016.01.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03005naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245009100166300001800257500001900275520175500294592002802049650001302077650002002090650001002110650001402120650001302134650001402147650001502161650001102176650001502187650001702202650001502219650001402234650001002248650001802258650001102276700002202287700001902309773015302328856008102481852000902562655001202571IND60725642720221118020655.0210128e202012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072564272DNAL7 a10.1134/S10623590201101022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMoseeva, M.

Information about the work histories and estimates of the liver absorbed doses from external and internal radiations were obtained from the “Mayak Worker Dosimetry System—2013” database; medical data and lifestyle factors were obtained from the “Clinic” medical and dosimetry database. Over the entire follow-up period, 221 cases of intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), 1463 cases of brain cerebral infarction (BI), and 342 cases of nonspecified stroke (NS) were registered in the study cohort. It was shown that the ICH, BI, and NS incidence risks in the study cohort were significantly associated with nonradiation factors such as gender, age, calendar period, duration of employment at the main plants, smoking, alcohol assumption, body mass index, and comorbidities (arterial hypertension and diabetes), which agreed with the literature data. Analyses did not reveal an effect of external γ-ray exposure on the ICH and BI incidence. However, NS relative risk (RR) was statistically significantly below the one in the groups of workers exposed to external γ-rays at the total absorbed liver doses above 0.20 Gy as compared with workers exposed at doses below 0.10 Gy. BI incidence RR was statistically significantly above the one in the groups of workers exposed to internal α-radiation at the total absorbed liver dose above 0.10 Gy as compared with workers exposed at lower doses. There was no effect of internal exposure on the ICH and NS incidence. These findings agreed with the results obtained earlier for the Mayak worker cohort.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalcohols 3abody mass index 3abrain 3adatabases 3adiabetes 3adosimetry 3aemployment 3agender 3ahemorrhage 3ahypertension 3ainfarction 3alifestyle 3aliver 3arelative risk 3astroke1 aGrigoryeva, E.

Seasonal precipitation is a key limiting factor regulating primary productivity, soil microbial activity, and ecosystem dynamics in arid and semiarid regions. As decomposers, soil microbial communities mediate critical ecosystem processes that ultimately affect the success of all trophic levels, and the activity of these microbial communities is primarily regulated by moisture availability. This research is focused on elucidating soil microbial responses to seasonal and yearly changes in soil moisture, temperature, and selected soil nutrient and edaphic properties in a Sotol Grassland in the Chihuahuan Desert at Big Bend National Park. Soil samples were collected over a 3-year period in March and September (2004–2006) at 0–15 cm soil depth from 12 3 × 3 m community plots. Bacterial and fungal carbon usage (quantified using Biolog 96-well micro-plates) was related to soil moisture patterns (ranging between 3.0 and 14%). In addition to soil moisture, the seasonal and yearly variability of soil bacterial activity was most closely associated with levels of soil organic matter, extractable NH₄–N, and soil pH. Variability in fungal activity was related to soil temperatures ranging between 13 and 26 °C. These findings indicate that changes in soil moisture, coupled with soil temperatures and resource availability, drive the functioning of soil-microbial dynamics in these desert grasslands. Temporal patterns in microbial activity may reflect the differences in the ability of bacteria and fungi to respond to seasonal patterns of moisture and temperature. Bacteria were more able to respond to moisture pulses regardless of temperature, while fungi only responded to moisture pulses during cooler seasons with the exception of substantial increased magnitudes in precipitation occurring during warmer months. Changes in the timing and magnitude of precipitation will alter the proportional contribution of bacteria and fungi to decomposition and nitrogen mineralization in this desert grassland.  aPublisher supplied data 3aarid zones 3aclimate change 3aclimate models 3afungi 3agrasslands 3amicrobial activity 3amicrobial communities 3anational parks 3aprimary productivity 3aseasonal variation 3asoil bacteria 3asoil depth 3asoil heterogeneity 3asoil nutrients 3asoil organic matter 3asoil pH 3asoil resources 3asoil sampling 3asoil temperature 3asoil water 3atrophic relationships 2aBacteriaxclassificationxgrowth & developmentxisolation & purification. 2aCarbonxmetabolism 2aDesert Climate 2aEcosystem 2aFungixclassificationxgrowth & developmentxisolation & purification. 2aHydrogen-Ion Concentration 2aNitrogenxmetabolism 2aPoaceaexgrowth & development 2aRain 2aSeasons 2aSoilxanalysis. 2aSoil Microbiology 2aTemperature 2aWaterxanalysis 3aChihuahuan Desert 3aNorth America 0aTexas1 aMcIntyre, Nancy1 aCox, Stephen1 aTissue, David1 aZak, John0 tMicrobial ecology.g2008 July, v. 56, no. 1 p.153-167dSpringer-Verlagx0095-36287nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00248-007-9333-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02529naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002400147245014700171520136600318592002801684650001301712650001401725650001701739650002601756700002301782700002001805700002401825700002501849700002101874700002101895700002101916700002801937773012301965856008202088852000902170655001202179IND60771398420221119193016.0220325e20220314xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077139842DNAL7 a10.3390/pathogens110303502doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aArnason, Niels Arni10aProtein Concentrations in Stored Pooled Platelet Concentrates Treated with Pathogen Inactivation by Amotosalen Plus Ultraviolet a Illumination  aPlatelet granules contain a diverse group of proteins. Upon activation and during storage, platelets release a number of proteins into the circulation or supernatant of stored platelet concentrate (PC). The aim of this work was to investigate the effect of pathogen inactivation (PI) on a selection of proteins released in stored platelets. Materials and Methods: PCs in platelet additive solution (PAS) were produced from whole blood donations using the buffy coat (BC) method. PCs in the treatment arm were pathogen inactivated with amotosalen and UVA, while PCs in the second arm were used as an untreated platelet control. Concentrations of 36 proteins were monitored in the PCs during storage. Results: The majority of proteins increased in concentration over the storage period. In addition, 10 of the 29 proteins that showed change had significantly different concentrations between the PI treatment and the control at one or more timepoints. A subset of six proteins displayed a PI-related drop in concentration. Conclusions: PI has limited effect on protein concentration stored PC supernatant. The protein’s changes related to PI treatment with elevated concentration implicate accelerated Platelet storage lesion (PSL); in contrast, there are potential novel benefits to PI related decrease in protein concentration that need further investigation.  aPublisher supplied data 3alighting 3apathogens 3astorage time 3aultraviolet radiation1 aJohannsson, Freyr 1 aLandrö, Ragna 1 aHardarsson, Björn 1 aGudmundsson, Sveinn 1 aLian, Aina-Mari 1 aReseland, Janne 1 aRolfsson, Ottar 1 aSigurjonsson, Olafur E.0 tPathogens.g2022 Mar. 14, v. 11, no. 3dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27146x2076-08177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/pathogens110303503Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03168naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002500150245012700175500001900302520175300321592002802074650005002102650001902152650000802171650002002179650001402199650002002213650001402233650002302247650001002270650001402280650002402294650001302318650001702331650001602348653003002364653001602394653001502410653001302425653001802438700002102456700002302477773010402500856008502604852000902689655001202698IND60692497820221117050029.0200804e202007  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069249782DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envres.2020.1096032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFuller, Christina H.10aEvaluating changes in ambient ozone and respiratory-related healthcare utilization in the Washington, DC metropolitan area  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aOzone pollution is a known respiratory irritant, yet we do not fully understand the magnitude or timing of respiratory effects based on short-term exposure. We investigated the associations between ambient ozone concentrations and respiratory symptoms as measured by healthcare utilization events. We used comprehensive electronic health records to identify respiratory responses to changes in ambient ozone levels. We constructed a dataset from Kaiser Permanente Mid-Atlantic States (KPMAS) that included information on 2013 and 2014 daily utilization rates for a broad range of healthcare utilization – nurse calls/emails, provider visits, emergency department and urgent care visits (ED/UC) and hospital admissions – by census block. We used 8-h average ozone concentrations collected from 48 air monitoring stations in the region via the Air Data database of the USEPA. We estimated the association between changes in ambient ozone (exposure windows of current day, 1-day lag and 3-day moving average) and changes in healthcare utilization using linear regression controlling for census tract-level socioeconomic indicators and temperature. Increases in ozone were associated with increases in three of the four utilization event types. A 10 ppb increase in 1-day ozone was associated with a 2.95% (95% CI: 1.93%, 3.96%) increase in calls/emails, a 1.56% (95% CI: 0.38%, 2.74%) increase in ED/UC visits and a 1.10% (95% CI: 0.48%, 1.73%) increase in provider visits. We did not find associations between ozone and hospital admissions. Proportionally, highest effects were found for nurse calls/emails possibly indicating a high number of mild effects that may be underreported in studies that examine only ED visits or hospital admissions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aUnited States Environmental Protection Agency 3aacute exposure 3aair 3adata collection 3adatabases 3ahealth services 3ahospitals 3ametropolitan areas 3aozone 3apollution 3aregression analysis 3aresearch 3atelemedicine 3atemperature 0aElectronic health records 0aRespiratory 0aHealthcare 0aHospital 0aAir pollution1 aJones, Jordan W.1 aRoblin, Douglas W.0 tEnvironmental research.g2020 July, v. 186 p.109603-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12442x0013-93517nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2020.1096033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02510naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001800139245013000157300001600287520112100303592002801424650001301452650004801465650002501513650002001538650002001558650000901578650001401587650002401601650001001625650001501635650003201650650002001682650003001702650003501732700002401767700002001791700001201811700002101823700001601844700001801860773009201878856007301970852000902043655001202052IND60411439620221121164748.0150925e201510  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6041143962DNAL7 a10.1111/age.123332doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSharma, B.

Given that susceptibility to MAP infection is determined in part by genetics, marker‐assisted selection may help in the breeding of animals that are more resistant to MAP infection. The toll‐like receptor 4 gene (TLR4) was selected as a potential candidate gene because of its role in innate immunity and its involvement in MAP recognition and infection. The objective of this study, therefore, was to identify associations between TLR4 polymorphisms and susceptibility to MAP infection in Canadian Holstein cows. Two biologically relevant SNPs, including c.‐226G>C in the 5′‐untranslated region and the non‐synonymous SNP c.2021C>T in the potential TIR domain, were selected for an association analysis with MAP infection status in 409 Canadian Holsteins. The haplotype C‐T from these combined SNPs yielded significant association with susceptibility to MAP infection, supporting the involvement of TLR4 in susceptibility to MAP infection.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHolstein 3aMycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis 3aToll-like receptor 4 3aanimal breeding 3acattle industry 3acows 3aenteritis 3afinancial economics 3agenes 3ahaplotypes 3ahost-pathogen relationships 3ainnate immunity 3amarker-assisted selection 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism1 aAbo‐Ismail, M.

To investigate AMY2B expansion in ancient breeds, which are highly divergent from modern breeds of presumed European origins, we analysed copy numbers in native Japanese dog breeds. Copy numbers in the Akita and Shiba, two ancient breeds in Japan, were higher than those in wolves. However, compared to a group of various modern breeds, Akitas had fewer copy numbers, whereas Shibas exhibited the same level of expansion as modern breeds. Interestingly, average AMY2B copy numbers in the Jomon‐Shiba, a unique line of the Shiba that has been bred to maintain their appearance resembling ancestors of native Japanese dogs and that originated in the same region as the Akita, were lower than those in the Shiba. These differences may have arisen from the earlier introduction of rice farming to the region in which the Shiba originated compared to the region in which the Akita and the Jomon‐Shiba originated. Thus, our data provide insights into the relationship between the introduction of agriculture and AMY2B expansion in dogs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aancestry 3adog breeds 3adogs 3adomestication 3afarming systems 3agenes 3arice 3awolves 3aJapan1 aHori, Y.1 aInoue‐Murayama, M.1 aKonno, A.1 aFujita, K.1 aMiyado, M.1 aFukami, M.1 aNagasawa, M.1 aMogi, K.1 aKikusui, T.0 tAnimal genetics.g2015 Oct., v. 46, no. 5 p.580-583dBlackwell Sciencex0268-91467nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/age.123443Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03101naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100006100150245014500211300001600356500001900372520175100391592002802142650002402170650002102194650001502215650001702230650001102247650002202258650002602280650001602306653003702322653002202359653002102381700002302402700002602425700005902451773009902510856008502609852000902694655001202703IND60700364020221119192824.0200824e20200715xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070036402DNAL7 a10.1016/j.wasman.2020.06.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSlorach, Peter C.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8420-969010aEnvironmental sustainability in the food-energy-water-health nexus: A new methodology and an application to food waste in a circular economy  ap. 359-368.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aCurrent studies on the food-energy-water nexus do not capture effects on human health. This study presents a new methodology for assessing the environmental sustainability in the food-energy-water-health nexus on a life cycle basis. The environmental impacts, estimated through life cycle assessment, are used to determine a total impact on the nexus by assigning each life cycle impact to one of the four nexus aspects. These are then normalised, weighted and aggregated to rank the options for each aspect and determine an overall nexus impact. The outputs of the assessment are visualised in a “nexus quadrilateral” to enable structured and transparent interpretation of results. The methodology is illustrated by considering resource recovery from household food waste within the context of a circular economy. The impact on the nexus of four treatment options is quantified: anaerobic digestion, in-vessel composting, incineration and landfilling. Anaerobic digestion is environmentally the most sustainable option with the lowest overall impact on the nexus. Incineration is the second best option but has a greater impact on the health aspect than landfilling. Landfilling has the greatest influence on the water aspect and the second highest overall impact on the nexus. In-vessel composting is the worst option overall, despite being favoured over incineration and landfilling in circular-economy waste hierarchies. This demonstrates that “circular” does not necessarily mean “environmentally sustainable.” The proposed methodology can be used to guide businesses and policy makers in interpreting a wide range of environmental impacts of products, technologies and human activities within the food-energy-water-health nexus.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanaerobic digestion 3acircular economy 3afood waste 3ahuman health 3ahumans 3aissues and policy 3alife cycle assessment 3amethodology 0aMulti-criteria decision analysis 0aResource recovery 0aWaste management1 aJeswani, Harish K.1 aCuéllar-Franca, Rosa1 aAzapagic, Adisa1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2380-918X0 tWaste management.g2020 July 15, v. 113 p.359-368dElsevier LtdwJournal:6325x0956-053X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2020.06.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02867naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100001900188245012100207300001800328506007600346520111000422592002801532506003701560650002501597650001601622650001301638650001101651650001901662650002701681650001601708650001901724650002301743650002401766650002101790650001401811650000901825650002801834650001601862650002101878700002001899700002001919700001801939700001801957700002101975700002001996700001702016700001902033700001802052773014102070856008102211852000902292655001202301IND60573939220221207051430.0170725e201612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057393922DNAL7 a10.1007/s10068-016-0268-32doi7 aPMC60492452pmcid7 a302634722pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYoo, Dae Young10aEffects of Dendropanax morbifera Léveille extract on hypothyroidism-induced oxidative stress in the rat hippocampus  ap. 1761-1766.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aIn this experiment, we verified the effects of Dendropanax morbifera Léveille stem extract (DMS) on hypothyroidism-induced oxidative stress in the hippocampus of rats. Hypothyroidism was induced in rats by treating them with 0.03% 2-mercapto-1-methyl-imidazole dissolved in drinking water for 5 weeks. DMS (100 mg/kg) was also orally administered to the rats during the same period and the animals were sacrificed at 12 weeks of age. DMS administration tended to ameliorate these hypothyroidism-induced changes in serum triiodothyronine (T₃), thyroxine (T₄), and thyroid-stimulating hormone levels. DMS administration significantly reduced the hypothyroidism-induced increases in reactive oxygen species production as well as in lipid peroxidation in the hippocampus. In addition, DMS administration increased hippocampal Cu, Zn-superoxide dismutase (SOD1), catalase (CAT), and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) levels. These results suggest that DMS potentially ameliorates hypothyroidism-induced neuroendocrine phenotypes and oxidative stress in the hippocampus via the induction of antioxidant enzymes.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDendropanax morbifer 3ablood serum 3acatalase 3acopper 3adrinking water 3aglutathione peroxidase 3ahippocampus 3ahypothyroidism 3alipid peroxidation 3aoral administration 3aoxidative stress 3aphenotype 3arats 3areactive oxygen species 3athyrotropin 3atriiodothyronine1 aJung, Hyo Young1 aKwon, Hyun Jung1 aKim, Jong Whi1 aNam, Sung Min1 aChung, Jin Young1 aChoi, Jung Hoon1 aKim, Dae Won1 aYoon, Yeo Sung1 aHwang, In Koo0 tFood science and biotechnology.g2016 Dec., v. 25, no. 6 p.1761-1766dThe Korean Society of Food Science and Technologyx1226-77087nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10068-016-0268-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02375naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005600148245006800204300001400272520117400286592002801460650001701488650001801505650002801523650000901551650002001560650002501580650001301605650001501618650002401633650002801657650002201685653000801707653002501715653001501740653001301755773011701768856008301885852000901968655001201977IND60569229020221121051340.0190219e201707  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056922902DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcpa.2017.05.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAbou Asa, S.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1964-689410aImmunohistochemical Expression of MCAM/CD146 in Canine Melanoma  ap. 27-33.  aMCAM/CD146 (melanoma cell adhesion molecule/CD146) is a transmembrane immunoglobulin superfamily cell adhesion molecule involved in transendothelial migration and signal transduction. It is expressed in melanoma, squamous cell carcinoma, prostatic, ovarian, cervical and endometrial cancers and promotes tumour growth, angiogenesis and metastasis. Melanoma is the most common malignant oral tumour of dogs and also arises in the skin, nail bed and footpad. The aim of this study was to investigate the immunohistochemical expression of MCAM/CD146 in 51 canine melanomas, including oral, cutaneous and ocular tumours. Seventeen of the 51 (33.3%) cases were negative, eight (15.7%) were weakly positive, seven (13.7%) were moderately positive and 19 (37.3%) were strongly positive. MCAM/CD146 was expressed by both oral and cutaneous melanomas; however, the intensity and the extent of the immunoreactivity was higher in oral (P = 0.009) than in cutaneous tumours (P = 0.058). Most ocular melanomas did not express MCAM/CD146 (P = 0.256). Expression of MCAM/CD146 by canine melanomas may suggest the molecule as a target for treatment, especially in oral melanomas.  aPublisher supplied data 3aangiogenesis 3acell adhesion 3acell adhesion molecules 3adogs 3aimmunoglobulins 3aimmunohistochemistry 3amelanoma 3ametastasis 3asignal transduction 3asquamous cell carcinoma 3auterine neoplasms 0adog 0aimmunohistochemistry 0aMCAM/CD146 0amelanoma0 tJournal of comparative pathology.g2017 July, v. 157, no. 1 p.27-33dElsevier LtdwJournal:1946x0021-99757nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcpa.2017.05.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03209naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245007900166300001800245500001900263520203000282592002802312650001902340650002402359650001502383650001602398650001302414650001102427650001302438650001402451650001502465650001402480650001602494650001702510700002102527700002002548773015302568856008102721852000902802655001202811IND60725643120221118020659.0210128e202012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072564312DNAL7 a10.1134/S10623590201200312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKoterov, A. N.10aHill’s Temporality Criterion: Reverse Causation and Its Radiation Aspect  ap. 1577-1609.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThis review considers various aspects of the temporality causation criterion and the corresponding confounders within the framework of temporal bias, including facts for radiation epidemiology. It is noted that this guideline is the only criterion in all sets of rules for assessing causation for nonexperimental (observational) disciplines, since falsification of it immediately eliminates the likelihood of causation. The exact terminology of the criterion, its philosophical essence, going back to the works of D. Hume and J. Mill (the cause must be before the effect), the epidemiological meaning (the need to observe a plausible latency period for the pathology under study), and the difficulties of establishing the temporal relationship in retrospective studies and its nonabsoluteness for individual disciplines and situations in the biomedical field are analyzed. The definitions of the concept “reverse causation” (protopathic bias) from fundamental sources, as well as confounders close to it within the framework of temporal biases (indications, contraindications, and severity of pathology/prognosis) are presented. Approaches to eliminate these temporal biases are listed. There are numerous examples of reverse causation from both everyday life (sociology, political science, and psychology) and the field of epidemiology and medicine. The facts of reverse causation for carcinogenesis in radiation epidemiology are considered in detail, all of which are within the framework of diagnostic or therapeutic irradiation, often prescribed to patients with pre-existing conditions for malignant neoplasms. The most important example is irradiation of children and young people during computed tomography; this paper briefly reviews all large-scale epidemiological studies on this theme (2012–2019) in relation to the problem of reverse causation. It is concluded that a review can serve for better orientation in the facts of reverse causation not only in epidemiology and medicine, but also in everyday life.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarcinogenesis 3acomputed tomography 3aguidelines 3airradiation 3amedicine 3apeople 3apolitics 3aprognosis 3apsychology 3asociology 3aterminology 3atherapeutics1 aUshenkova, L.

The remote bystander effect, related to nontargeted effects, is one of the least studied phenomena in terms of manifestations and mechanisms. The international laboratory practice with respect to this phenomenon commenced with demonstration of the bystander effect in fish and other aquacultures. Our studies have revealed changes similar to radiation-induced pathologies in nonirradiated mice kept for three months in contact with the irradiated species (exposed to a 3 Gy γ-ray dose). Changes in behavioral responses, a statistically significant trend for decreasing spleen weight (r = –0.416; p = 0.048), an expanding area of alopecia (r = –0.631; p = 0.001), and other anomalies are noted. Discussions on possible mechanisms of the phenomena refer to both A.M. Kuzin’s theory of radiotoxins (1966) and the interpretation of the hypotheses investigated by C. Mothersill (2010–2019). An assumption is made on the important role of derivatives of lipid peroxides in the formation of this effect. The results of these studies indicate the need for further investigation of the radiation-induced bystander effect by using the molecular and cellular methodological approaches.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalopecia 3afish 3airradiation 3aspleen1 aPelevina, I.

Sixteen pigs on day 58 of age were divided into two groups and fed either a diet free of additional inorganic phosphorus (P) and supplemented with phytase (Diet LP, 4.23 g total P/kg diet) or a diet with a mineral source of P and not supplemented with phytase (Diet SP, 5.38 g total P/kg diet). Performance data and the apparent total tract digestibility of nutrients were estimated between days 58 and 114, and 72 and 86 of age, respectively. On day 114 of age, the pigs were slaughtered, the femur was dissected and the mineral content and mineral density, maximum strength and maximum elastic strength, cortical wall thickness, cross-sectional area and cortical index were analysed. The growth performance and digestibility of nutrient fractions (with exception of P) did not differ between treatment groups. The P-digestibility was significantly higher in Group LP. The femur of pigs in Group LP had significantly greater cortical wall thickness, cortical index, bone mineral content, bone mineral density, maximum strength and maximum elastic strength than Group SP. Femur maximum strength and maximum elastic strength were correlated with cortical wall thickness and cortical index. Resulting from the different supply of digestible P, the femur geometrical, densitometric and mechanical properties of Group LP were better than those of Group SP. The mechanical properties of the femur of pigs depended more on its geometrical characteristics than on the degree of its mineralisation.  aPublisher supplied data 3apiglets 3amineralization 3adiet 3ainorganic phosphorus 3amorphometry 3adensitometry 3aphytases 3aswine feeding 3amineral content 3amechanical properties 3abone density 3agrowth performance 3adigestibility 3anutrients 3ageometry 3afemur 0aperformance 0aBone mineralisation 0amorphometrics 0aphosphorus1 aSobol, Monika1 aRaj, Stanisława0 tArchives of animal nutrition.g2017 Jan. 2, v. 71, no. 1 p.81-92dTaylor & Francisx1477-28177nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/1745039X.2016.12505423Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01651naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094024002200121024001900143040001800162100001100180245013400191300001200325506007600337520048500413592002800898506003700926650001900963650002300982650002501005650002201030650002301052700002401075700001901099773009901118856007501217852000901292655001201301IND60578862520221207052228.0170814e20150102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057886252DNAL7 a10.1021/ol503116q2doi7 aPMC42957962pmcid7 a254899782pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Bo12aA Mild, Diastereoselective Construction of Cyclic and Spirocyclic Ketals Employing a Tandem Photoisomerization/Cyclization Tactic  ap. 3-5.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe cyclization of trans-δ-hydroxy enones to cyclic mixed ketals routinely requires superstoichiometric strong acid.

However, there is little information regarding the composition of various commercially available soy-based beverages and uncertainty among patients regarding the utility of fermented soy products. Current study evaluates the health benefits of QCAN® Plus—an easily available fermented soy drink. This study was performed in lean (n = 10) and obese (n = 10) subjects. The subjects were observed during pre-soy (weeks −2, −1, and 0), on-soy (weeks 1, 2, 3, and 4), and post-soy (weeks 6, 8, 10, and 12) periods. The serum samples during these visits were subjected to lipid profile analysis and multiplex assay for cytokines. The results revealed that total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels were significantly reduced in both lean and obese individuals during on-soy (P ≤ .05). Furthermore, cytokines such as platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) AA and AB/BB were significantly lowered on-soy compared with pre-soy (P ≤ .05) in lean subjects and PDGF AA, IL-1RA, and GMCSF were significantly reduced on-soy (P ≤ .05) in obese subjects. In addition, a qualitative and quantitative analysis of the Q-CAN Plus by a third-party laboratory confirmed its chemical and microbial safety. Our preliminary study on Q-CAN Plus ensures its safety for consumption and highlights its hypolipidemic and suppressive effect on certain cytokines. These observations and relevant studies in future might guide clinicians in future to consider Q-CAN Plus as a therapeutic nutritional supplement.  aPublisher supplied data 3abeverages 3ablood serum 3acytokines 3alipid composition 3alow density lipoprotein cholesterol 3apatients 3aplatelet-derived growth factor 3aquantitative analysis 3asoybean products 3atherapeutics 3auncertainty 0acholesterol 0afermented soy drink 0ahyperlipidemia 0aisoflavones 0aobesity1 aDioletis, Evangelos1 aPaiva, Ricardo1 aFields, Maxine R.1 aWeiss, Theresa R.1 aSecor, Eric R.1 aAli, Ather0 tJournal of medicinal food.g2020 May 01, v. 23, no. 5 p.560-563dMary Ann Liebert, Inc.wJournal:jnl57082x1557-76007nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1089/jmf.2019.01163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03341naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002300153245008200176520191100258592002802169650001502197650001202212650002602224650001602250650001402266650001902280650001002299650003102309650001502340650001502355650001302370650001902383650001102402650001502413650001802428650001402446650001802460651001202478653001402490653001202504653001202516700002302528700002002551700002102571700002702592773011902619856008802738852000902826655001202835IND60750843720221118140908.0211123e20220120xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075084372DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.1502612doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStaehr, Peter A.U.10aContribution of boulder reef habitats to oxygen dynamics of a shallow estuary  aWe assessed the importance of boulder reefs to the oxygen dynamics of a shallow estuary during two growing seasons in 2017 and 2018. Using open-system diel oxygen measurements and benthic and pelagic incubations, we evaluated the relative contribution of pelagic and benthic habitats to the ecosystem metabolism along a depth gradient in two areas, with (Reef) and without (Bare) boulder reefs in the Limfjorden, Denmark. System integrated areal rates of gross primary production (GPP) and ecosystem respiration (ER) both increased with depth in both areas. Benthic contribution to system GPP and ER was highest at shallow depth where it represented 47 and 53% respectively. However, with increasing depth pelagic processes dominated GPP and ER (98 and 94%) even in the Reef area. Although the Reef area had higher biomass of auto- and heterotrophic organisms (macroalgae and macrofauna), benthic GPP was at similar level in both areas, due to a significant contribution from micro-phytobenthic organisms. The Reef area had lower sediment pools of organic matter, nitrogen and phosphorous and was slightly more oxygenated compared to the nearby Bare area. Extreme temperatures and higher levels of nutrients in 2018 caused a marked increase in benthic ER rates resulting in net heterotrophy (NEM = GPP − ER < 0) in 2018 compared to net autotrophy (NEM > 0) in 2017. Under current eutrophic conditions, boulder reefs do not contribute positively to the oxygen dynamics in the estuary. Reoccurring blooms of phytoplankton with high organic matter decomposition combined with high temperatures and dominance of fauna stimulate depletion of oxygen around the reefs. Significant improvements in water clarity are needed to regrow perennial macroalgae and induce net autotrophy. Under current turbid conditions, it is only recommended to establish boulder reefs in shallow (<3 m) parts of the estuary.  aPublisher supplied data 3aautotrophs 3abiomass 3aecosystem respiration 3aenvironment 3aestuaries 3aeutrophication 3afauna 3agross primary productivity 3amacroalgae 3ametabolism 3anitrogen 3aorganic matter 3aoxygen 3aphosphorus 3aphytoplankton 3asediments 3awater quality 3aDenmark 0aEcosystem 0aBenthic 0aPelagic1 aStaehr, Sanjina U.1 aTonetta, Denise1 aHøgslund, Signe1 aNielsen, Mette Møller0 tScience of the total environment.g2022 Jan. 20, v. 805 p.150261-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.1502613Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02196naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001600148245006800164300001600232520100900248592002801257650001501285650001601300650001501316650002801331650002501359650002301384650002101407650001501428650001701443653002401460653001701484653002301501700001401524700001701538700001401555700001401569773011101583856008301694852000901777655001201786IND60091625720221116144451.0210715e20130315xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009162572DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bios.2012.09.0512doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJia, Boyang10aIncreased power density from a spiral wound microbial fuel cell  ap. 894-897.  aUsing Microbial fuel cell (MFC) to convert organic and inorganic matter into electricity is of great interest for powering portable devices, which is now still limited by the output of MFC. In this study, a spiral wound MFC (SWMFC) with relatively large volume normalized surface area of separator (4.2cm²/ml) was fabricated to enhance power generation. Compared with double-membrane MFC (DMMFC) and conventional double chamber MFC (DCMFC), the power density of SWMFC increased by 42% and 99% resulted from its lower internal resistance. Besides larger separator area, the better performance of SWMFC benefited from its structure sandwiching the cathodes between two separators. This point was proved again by a comparison of another DCMFC and a triple chamber MFC (TCMFC) as well as a simulation using finite element method. Moreover, the feature of SWMFC was more convenient and compact to scale up. Therefore, SWMFC provides a promising configuration for high power output as a portable power source.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiosensors 3aelectricity 3aelectrodes 3afinite element analysis 3amicrobial fuel cells 3aportable equipment 3apower generation 3aseparators 3asurface area 0aMicrobial fuel cell 0aSpiral wound 0aMathematical model1 aHu, Dawei1 aXie, Beizhen1 aDong, Kun1 aLiu, Hong0 tBiosensors & bioelectronics.g2013 Mar. 15, v. 41 p.894-897dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11631x0956-56637nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bios.2012.09.0513Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03505naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100005600151245012900207520213200336592002802468650001702496650001702513650002102530650002402551650001702575650001502592651002002607653002402627653002102651653002002672653002402692653001702716653002502733700001502758700001602773700001702789700005202806700001702858773011302875856008602988852000903074655001203083IND60755883820221122050223.0211213e20211215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075588382DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2021.1295782doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYuan, Yilong1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1372-301910aMultiphase flow and mechanical behaviors induced by gas production from clayey-silt hydrate reservoirs using horizontal well  aNatural gas hydrates are one of very important future clean energy resources with extensive distribution in the world. The field production tests are very difficult with high investment, while numerical simulation is an effective and economical method for the early evaluation. HydrateBiot, a novel thermo-hydro-mechanical (THM) coupled simulator, has been developed to investigate the mechanical behaviors during gas production from hydrate reservoirs. For the clayey-silt hydrate reservoirs in the Shenhu area of South China Sea, the horizontal well was proposed for improving gas production through depressurization. The controllable parameters, including well placement and well perforation length, were optimized firstly. HydrateBiot was used to predict the mechanical responses induced by gas production from hydrate reservoirs. The results indicated that the horizontal well placement significantly affected hydrate production efficiency. Thus, the advanced technology, such as hydrate reservoir precise exploration and offshore directional drilling, should be developed in the future. When the horizontal well length exceeded 400 m, the increase in well length led to a slight decrease in hydrate production efficiency. The mechanical responses suggested that depressurization led to stress concentration and increased in shear stress around the horizontal well. The subsidence mainly derived from compression of pore volume in sediments during depressurization. The maximum seafloor subsidence reached approximately 0.5 m after 1-year depressurization using horizontal well. The potential shear failure in the hydrate reservoir was mainly due to significant increase in shear stress and hydrate dissociation for weakening sediments. Thus, a balance between mechanical stability and gas productivity must be considered during depressurization by using horizontal well. The developed methods and obtained results presented here could help engineers to design safe hydrate production schemes under similar reservoir conditions and to conclude the complex mechanical behaviors during depressurization hydrate production.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclean energy 3adissociation 3ahorizontal wells 3amathematical models 3ashear stress 3asubsidence 3aSouth China Sea 0aNatural gas hydrate 0aDepressurization 0aHorizontal well 0aMechanical response 0aOptimization 0aNumerical simulation1 aXu, Tianfu1 aJin, Chunhe1 aZhu, Huixing1 aGong, Ye1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5408-79281 aWang, Fugang0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2021 Dec. 15, v. 328 p.129578-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2021.1295783Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03622naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100006600139245006700205300001800272500001900290500002000309520170400329592002802033596010202061596004802163596005702211596007702268596007402345596005902419650002002478650002002498650001502518650002702533650001102560650002002571650002002591650002102611650002602632650001902658650000702677650001902684650001602703650001702719650000902736650002302745700005802768700005802826773012602884856007303010852000903083655001203092IND60707023620221116221329.0200812e202008  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070702362DNAL7 a10.1111/rec.129972doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBlankenship, W.

S127-S138.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aTackifiers are long‐chain carbon compounds used for soil stabilization and hydroseeding and could provide a vehicle for biological soil crust restoration. We examined the sensitivity of two dryland mosses, Bryum argenteum and Syntrichia ruralis, to three common tackifiers—guar, psyllium, and polyacrylamide (PAM)—at 0.5×, 1.0×, and 2.0× of recommended (×) concentrations for erosion control and revegetation. We measured moss shoot, gemma, and protonema production as well as moss organic matter and bound sand masses as indicators of growth and soil holding ability. We tested sand and tackifier chemistry to investigate potential nutrient and toxicant potential on moss growth. Groups of 10 fragments from field‐collected mosses were grown on sand in open petri dishes arranged in a growth chamber in replicated blocks containing each tackifier and concentration combination plus a distilled water control. Bryum (n = 10) and Syntrichia (n = 9) growth were measured at the end of 6 and 5 weeks, respectively. Overall model tests yielded statistically significant results (p < 0.001) for every variable in each species. When compared to water, guar tended to decrease growth, psyllium tended to increase growth, and PAM's effects were generally neutral to positive. Within tackifier types, increasing concentrations of guar tended to decrease growth, while increasing concentrations of psyllium tended to increase growth. Changes in PAM concentrations had little effect on growth. Increases in guar and psyllium lowered pH and increased P and K. Psyllium and PAM yielded promising results as potential agents of dispersal and adherence of dryland mosses in field restoration.  aPublisher supplied data  aGraduate Teaching AssistantshipcOregon State University, Deptartment of Botany & Plant Pathology  aNative Plant ResearchcPortland Garden Club  aSagebrush EcosystemscU.S. Bureau of Land Management  aNevada State Office ‐ Nevada BiocrustscU.S. Fish and Wildlife Service  aCoordinated Intermountain Restoration ProjectcU.S. Geological Survey  aNational Invasive Species ProgramcU.S. Forest Service 3aBryum argenteum 3aTortula ruralis 3aarid lands 3abiological soil crusts 3acarbon 3aerosion control 3agrowth chambers 3aland restoration 3amosses and liverworts 3aorganic matter 3apH 3apolyacrylamide 3aprotonemata 3apsyllium gum 3asand 3asoil stabilization1 aCondon, Lea A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9357-38811 aPyke, David A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4578-83350 tRestoration ecology.g2020 Aug., v. 28 Suppl S2 p.S127-S138dWiley Periodicals, Inc.wJournal:jnl3867104x1061-29717nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/rec.129973Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01322naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001900139245008800158300001400246520042600260592002800686650001500714650001400729650002300743650002300766650001200789650001200801700002200813773010100835856007500936852000901011655001201020IND60578862620221120195532.0170814e20150102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057886262DNAL7 a10.1021/ol503119z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLee, Pin-Sheng10aCobalt-Catalyzed Enantioselective Directed C–H Alkylation of Indole with Styrenes  ap. 22-25.  aA cobalt–chiral phosphoramidite catalyst promotes enantioselective imine-directed C2-alkylation of Boc-protected indoles with styrenes.

We hypothesized that a food optimized to delay gastric emptying, a reduced alcohol bioavailability bar (RABB), would decrease postprandial BAC and alcohol bioavailability with greater caloric-efficiency than control foods. Therefore, we evaluated the RABB in a randomized, crossover trial in 21 overnight fasted healthy adults (10 male, 11 female). Just before consuming a moderate dose of alcohol (0.3–0.35 g/kg body weight), participants ate either (1) no food (NF, 0 kcal), (2) the RABB (210 kcal), (3) a savory snack mix (SSM, 210 kcal), or (4) a multicomponent meal (MCM, 635 kcal) and their BAC was measured over 90 minutes using a breathalyzer, the primary endpoint being peak BAC (pBAC). pBACs were analyzed by repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) (F = 107.5, P < .0001) with the differences between means assessed using Tukey's honestly significant difference test. The pBAC of each group was different (P < .001) from all other groups (NF = 0.064 ± 0.003, SSM = 0.047 ± 0.002, RABB = 0.031 ± 0.002, MCM = 0.020 ± 0.002%; mean ± standard error of the mean). Furthermore, the bioavailability of alcohol over 90 minutes (BA90) was reduced compared to the NF group by similar margins (SSM = 22.0 ± 2.2, RABB = 45.0 ± 3.8, MCM = 67.9 ± 3.1%) with the mean BA90 of each group different from all other groups (P < .001). Compared to the NF condition, the average reduction of pBAC per 100 calories of food consumed was higher for the RABB (24.0%) than either the SSM (11.8%) or the MCM (10.7%). This study demonstrates that the RABB can reduce both pBAC and alcohol bioavailability with high caloric-efficiency.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aaccidents 3aadults 3aalcohols 3aanalysis of variance 3abioavailability 3ablood 3abody weight 3aclinical trials 3across-over studies 3afemales 3afoods 3agastric emptying 3amales 3apoisoning 3asnacks 0aBAC 0abinge drinking 0afirst pass metabolism 0afood 0aintoxication 0aprotein1 aWolever, Thomas M.S.1 aCampbell, Janice E.1 aEzatagha, Adish1 aNoronha, Jarvis C.1 aJenkins, Alexandra L.0 tJournal of medicinal food.g2020 Apr. 01, v. 23, no. 4 p.432-439dMary Ann Liebert, Inc.wJournal:jnl57082x1557-76007nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1089/jmf.2019.02283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03252naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245008200168300001500250520176400265592002802029650002002057650001902077650002002096650001602116650002302132650001102155650004302166650001402209650001502223650002402238650001902262650001502281650002502296650002402321651001702345653001402362653002502376653002502401653001302426653001402439653001702453700001902470700001902489700002002508700002402528773009102552856008202643852000902725655001202734IND60567174920221116232023.0220523e201612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056717492DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jag.2016.08.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aParplies, André10aPhenomapping of rangelands in South Africa using time series of RapidEye data  ap. 90-102.  aPhenomapping is an approach which allows the derivation of spatial patterns of vegetation phenology and rangeland productivity based on time series of vegetation indices. In our study, we propose a new spatial mapping approach which combines phenometrics derived from high resolution (HR) satellite time series with spatial logistic regression modeling to discriminate land management systems in rangelands. From the RapidEye time series for selected rangelands in South Africa, we calculated bi-weekly noise reduced Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) images. For the growing season of 2011⿿2012, we further derived principal phenology metrics such as start, end and length of growing season and related phenological variables such as amplitude, left derivative and small integral of the NDVI curve. We then mapped these phenometrics across two different tenure systems, communal and commercial, at the very detailed spatial resolution of 5m. The result of a binary logistic regression (BLR) has shown that the amplitude and the left derivative of the NDVI curve were statistically significant. These indicators are useful to discriminate commercial from communal rangeland systems. We conclude that phenomapping combined with spatial modeling is a powerful tool that allows efficient aggregation of phenology and productivity metrics for spatially explicit analysis of the relationships of crop phenology with site conditions and management. This approach has particular potential for disaggregated and patchy environments such as in farming systems in semi-arid South Africa, where phenology varies considerably among and within years. Further, we see a strong perspective for phenomapping to support spatially explicit modelling of vegetation.  aPublisher supplied data 3afarming systems 3agrowing season 3aland management 3aland tenure 3amanagement systems 3amodels 3anormalized difference vegetation index 3aphenology 3arangelands 3aregression analysis 3aremote sensing 3asatellites 3atime series analysis 3avegetation gradient 3aSouth Africa 0aPhenology 0aVegetation amplitude 0aTime series analysis 0aRapidEye 0aRangeland 0aSouth Africa1 aDubovyk, Olena1 aTewes, Andreas1 aMund, Jan-Peter1 aSchellberg, Jürgen0 tITC journal.g2016 Dec., v. 53 p.90-102dElsevier B.V.wJournal:22337x1569-84327nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jag.2016.08.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01472naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002100139245010800160300001600268520047800284592002800762650002100790650001400811650001900825650001300844650002900857650001200886650001800898700002200916700002100938773010300959856007501062852000901137655001201146IND60578862720221120205129.0170814e20150102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057886272DNAL7 a10.1021/ol50314692doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNishiyama, Junya14aThe Cyclopentyl Group, As a Small but Bulky Terminal Group, Allows Rapid and Efficient Active Transport  ap. 138-141.  aSecondary ammonium salts bearing a cyclopentyl terminal group rapidly formed pseudorotaxane with 1.5 equiv of DB24C8.

The aim of this study was to select climate change projection data for selected crop phenology and mycotoxin impact models. Using the ENSEMBLES database of climate model output, this study illustrates how the projected climate change signal of important variables as temperature, precipitation and relative humidity depends on the choice of the climate model. Using climate change projections from at least two different climate models is recommended to account for model uncertainty. To make the climate projections suitable for impact analysis at the local scale a weather generator approach was adopted. As the weather generator did not treat all the necessary variables, an ad-hoc statistical method was developed to synthesise realistic values of missing variables.

The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of lameness in fresh dairy cows on attributes of feeding (registered with the RumiWatch noseband sensor): rumination time (RT), drinking time (DT), eating time (ET), rumination chews (RC), eating chews (EC), chews per minute (CM), drinking gulps (DG), bolus count (B), and chews per bolus (CB). The measurement registration was started at the first day after calving and continued until 30 days after calving. There were 20 Lithuanian black and white breed cows selected. Lameness diagnosis was performed by trained staff based on a locomotion score system and it was diagnosed on average on the 15th day after calving. The causes of lameness were categorized as sole ulcer, abscess and foot rot. Special attention was paid to attributes of feeding registered 14 days before and 13 days after diagnosis. The 10 lame cows (LG) used in this experiment had a lameness score of 3–4 presented with severe lameness: they were reluctant to move and unwilling to complete weight transfer off the affected limb. The 10 healthy cows (HG) were given a lameness score of 1. We found that lameness of fresh dairy cows has an impact on inline registered ingestive behaviors biomarkers—the mean RT of HG cows was as much as 2.19 times higher than that of LG cows on the day of diagnosis of lameness, later this difference between the groups decreased to the sixth day of treatment, then increased again and decreased at the end of the experiment. The lowest eating time was found on diagnosis day and the highest on the ninth day before determination of lameness. Drinking time was higher in the HG group, with the exception of 10 and 9 days prior to clinical signs of disease in LG cows. A downward trend in rumination chews was observed in LG cows from day 7 until the onset of clinical symptoms. The bolus count decreased from day 3 before diagnosis to day 1 after diagnosis in LG cows. The largest difference in this indicator between groups was found on day of diagnosis. Analysing the pattern of CM values in the LG group, we found a decrease from 10 days before to 2 days after diagnosis. The CB value was almost the same in both groups of cows at the end of the experiment, but largest difference between the groups was found on day 7 after clinical sings of lameness.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabscess 3aagriculture 3alameness 3alocomotion 3arumination1 aJuozaitienė, Vida 1 aUrbonavičius, Gediminas 1 aMalašauskienė, Dovilė 1 aTelevičius, Mindaugas 1 aUrbutis, Mingaudas 1 aBaumgartner, Walter 0 tAgriculture (Basel).g2021 Sept. 06, v. 11, no. 9dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:12387x2077-04727nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agriculture110908513Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03763naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100007300151245008700224500001900311520218800330592002802518650001302546650001702559650001802576650002302594650001002617650001402627650002202641650001302663650002302676650000902699650002002708650002102728651001302749651001302762651000902775653002302784653002402807653001502831653002702846700002002873700003002893700002502923700001902948700002202967700006002989773010103049856008603150852000903236655001203245IND60697979220221121202250.0201111e202010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069797922DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecolind.2020.1065502doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDuran-Bautista, Ervin Humprey1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4155-635010aTermites as indicators of soil ecosystem services in transformed amazon landscapes  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aTermite communities reflect soil conditions and the condition of the ecosystem services that they provide. The present study first evaluated the relationship between termite communities and soil conditions in a wide range of land use systems in deforested areas in the Colombian and Peruvian Amazon. Then, we identified termite indicator species for the ecosystem service levels provided by them. Termites were collected on 38 farms in both countries (12 in Colombia and 26 in Peru) at 190 sampling points (five per farm). Eight types of plant cover were identified: natural forests, secondary vegetation, agroforestry systems, sylvopastoral systems, perennial and annual crops, degraded and wooded pastures. Variables representing chemical fertility, hydrological functions of the soil, soil macro-aggregation and macroinvertebrate communities respectively, were measured at each point. Then, four synthetic indicators of ecosystem services were designed, respectively, based on this information. Termite indicator species for soil ecosystem services were searched for using the index value indicator method (IndVal). Among the 48 species collected (12 in Colombia, 45 in Peru and nine in common), 11 were identified as indicator species. Two indicator species were found in Colombia: one for chemical fertility and one for state of soil macro-aggregation. No indicator species were registered for hydrological soil functions and macroinvertebrate community biodiversity. In Peru, nine species were statistically significant indicators: four for chemical fertility, one for soil macro-aggregation, six for macroinvertebrate community biodiversity, two for hydrological soil functions, and four species were indicators for more than one service. This study presents significant evidence of the negative effects of degrading changes in land use on the abundance and richness of termite communities. The indicator ability demonstrated by termite species makes them a valuable monitoring tool. Their absence or presence can opportunely indicate the negative effects of certain management practices on soil ecosystem services. It can also indicate progress in soil restoration processes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aIsoptera 3abiodiversity 3adeforestation 3aecosystem services 3afarms 3ahydrology 3aindicator species 3aland use 3amacroinvertebrates 3asoil 3asoil ecosystems 3asoil restoration 3aAmazonia 3aColombia 3aPeru 0aChemical fertility 0aDeforested Amazonia 0aSoil fauna 0aSoil macro-aggregation1 aArmbrecht, Inge1 aSerrão Acioli, Agno Nato1 aSuárez, Juan Carlos1 aRomero, Miguel1 aQuintero, Marcela1 aLavelle, Patrick1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2127-10670 tEcological indicators.g2020 Oct., v. 117 p.106550-dElsevier LtdwJournal:6196x1470-160X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2020.1065503Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03364naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002300150245011700173300001600290520187100306592002802177650002202205650002902227650001802256650002502274650001602299650001302315650003202328650001102360650001702371650001202388650001202400650001402412653002502426653003702451653000802488653001402496653002602510653001702536700001902553700001902572700002202591700002202613700002302635773011802658856008502776852000902861655001202870IND60525847220221119084323.0180829e201605  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052584722DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbagen.2015.11.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDraczkowski, Piotr10aDetermination of affinity and efficacy of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors using isothermal titration calorimetry  ap. 967-974.  aAcetylcholinesterase (AChE), an enzyme rapidly terminating nerve signals at synapses of cholinergic neurons is an important drug target in treatment of Alzheimer's disease and related memory loss conditions. Here we present comprehensive use of isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) for investigation of AChE kinetics and AChE-inhibitor interactions.Acetylcholinesterase (AChE, EC 3.1.1.7) from Electrophorus electricus was assayed for interactions with five well known AChE inhibitors, galanthamine, tacrine, donepezil, edrophonium and ambenonium. In ITC experiments the inhibitors were injected to the enzyme solution solely (for thermodynamic characterization of binding) or in presence of the substrate, acetylcholine (for determination of inhibitors potency).Detailed description of various experimental protocols is presented, allowing evaluation of inhibitors potency (in terms of IC50 and Ki) and thermodynamic parameters of the binding. The potency of tested inhibitors was in nano to micromolar range which corresponded to activities determined in conventional method. Binding of all inhibitors showed to be enthalpy driven and obtained Ka values demonstrated good correlation with the data from standard Ellman's assay.Obtained results confirmed the usability of the ITC technique for comprehensive characterization of AChE-inhibitor interactions and AChE kinetics. The method reduced the complexity of reaction mixture and interference problems with the advantage of using natural substrates.The work reports complete thermodynamic characteristics of the AChE — inhibitor complexes. Due to the universal character of ITC measurements, described protocols can be easily adapted to other enzymatic systems.

As an important water source of the middle route of the South-to-North Water Diversion Project in China, the water security of Han River and its related water quality have become a national concern. Here, we conducted spatiotemporal analysis and prediction of the water quality in the middle-lower reaches of the Han River by utilizing an integrated nonparametric diagnosis approach. System models including a Seasonal and Trend decomposition using Loess (STL), Mann–Kendall (MK), Redundancy Analysis (RDA), Coefficient of Divergence (CDiv) and a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model. Results from February to April of 2004–2018 indicated that, the average concentration of total phosphorus (TP) at the Zongguan Station was 0.107 ± 0.012 mg/L, while the total nitrogen (TN) was 1.945 ± 0.116 mg/L. The STL and MK analysis showed no significant trend for TP but an upward tendency for TN at the Zongguan station. The variation of TP and TN concentration in 2008 was mainly related to the most serious algal bloom event, while the tipping points in 2014 and 2016 were attributed to the abundant precipitation. Significant spatial distribution were obtained based on the CDiv and RDA methods; four categories were clustered and water quality was deteriorated gradually from upstream to downstream. The future prediction of monthly averaged TN concentrations during the period of 2019–2025 exceeded the limit of the environmental water quality standard (GB 3838–2002) (Class III, TN = 1.0 mg/L), leading to potential water quality risk in the Han River during 2019–2025 under strong effect of human activity. Under the worsening trends for the concentrations of TN and TP, the local departments should strictly control the amount of sewage and wastewater discharged from various industries, especially for phosphate fertilizer and rock enterprises, agriculture and aquaculture. This study expected to provide technical means for the follow-up pollution control and is useful for the sustainable improvement of river ecological environment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgal blooms 3aaquaculture 3ahumans 3aloess 3aneural networks 3aphosphorus fertilizers 3apollution control 3aprediction 3arisk 3arivers 3asewage 3atotal nitrogen 3atotal phosphorus 3awastewater 3awater quality 3awater quality standards 3awater security 3aChina 0aHan river 0aSpatiotemporal variation 0aIntegrated nonparametric diagnosis approach 0aWater quality analysis 0aWater diversion project1 aZhang, Yuan1 aXia, Rui1 aWang, Lu1 aZhang, Nan1 aZhang, Xinfei0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2021 Dec. 15, v. 328 p.129583-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2021.1295833Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02967naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002000148245008400168520171200252592002801964650001901992650001802011650001102029650001902040650002102059650000902080650002002089650002402109653001002133653001102143653001202154653000802166653000902174700002502183700002002208700002302228700002402251700002502275700002002300773012102320856008302441852000902524655001202533IND60751279820221119082040.0220228e202203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075127982DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jevs.2021.1037712doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHerbst, Alisa C10aDevelopment and Evaluation of a Muscle Atrophy Scoring System (MASS) for Horses  aLoss of skeletal muscle mass likely compromises performance and welfare in horses and thus routine monitoring would be valuable. Currently available methods to assess muscle mass require expert knowledge and are often expensive. To provide a simple method, a muscle atrophy scoring system (MASS) was created and tested by three evaluators (raters) in 38 horses of varying age, breed, and health status. Inter-rater agreement on atrophy scores was in the good-to-excellent range for ratings of the neck (ICC = 0.62), back (ICC = 0.62) and hind (ICC = 0.76) regions but was poor for the abdominal region (ICC = 0.29). Due to this low agreement, the abdominal region was excluded from further analysis. Associations between muscle atrophy scores and age, pituitary pars intermedia dysfunction (PPID) status, and body composition indicators, including weight and estimated fat-free mass (FFM), were examined. Weight was inversely associated with neck, back and hind muscle atrophy scores (β = -0.008, β = -0.008, β = -0.009, respectively; all P <0.001), but estimated FFM was not associated with muscle atrophy scores at any region (P >0.05). Age was positively related to neck (β = 0.030, P <0.01), back (β = 0.037, P <0.001) and hind (β = 0.040, P <0.001) muscle atrophy scores. PPID-positive horses (n = 4) had higher muscle atrophy scores than PPID-negative horses (n = 23), even after adjusting for age (P <0.05). This data suggests that neck, back and hind region evaluations by individual raters likely have acceptable reliability. In addition, these findings support further evaluation of the potential benefits of the MASS to identify and monitor muscle atrophy in horses.  aPublisher supplied data 3aexpert opinion 3ahealth status 3ahorses 3alean body mass 3amuscular atrophy 3aneck 3askeletal muscle 3aveterinary medicine 0aHorse 0aMuscle 0aAtrophy 0aAge 0aPPID1 aJohnson, Mackenzie G1 aGammons, Hayley1 aReedy, Stephanie E1 aUrschel, Kristine L1 aHarris, Patricia A.,1 aAdams, Amanda A0 tJournal of equine veterinary science.g2022 Mar., v. 110 p.103771-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl33309x0737-08067nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jevs.2021.1037713Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02736naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100006100147245009200208300001400300520153500314592002801849650002001877650001301897650002201910650001001932650001501942650001501957653001001972653001001982653001801992653001402010653000802024700002202032700006102054700005402115773009002169856008202259852000902341655001202350IND60567175120221116231624.0220523e201612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056717512DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jag.2016.08.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRoelens, Jennifer1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4885-005810aExtracting cross sections and water levels of vegetated ditches from LiDAR point clouds  ap. 64-75.  aThe hydrologic response of a catchment is sensitive to the morphology of the drainage network. Dimensions of bigger channels are usually well known, however, geometrical data for man-made ditches is often missing as there are many and small. Aerial LiDAR data offers the possibility to extract these small geometrical features. Analysing the three-dimensional point clouds directly will maintain the highest degree of information. A longitudinal and cross-sectional buffer were used to extract the cross-sectional profile points from the LiDAR point cloud. The profile was represented by spline functions fitted through the minimum envelop of the extracted points. The cross-sectional ditch profiles were classified for the presence of water and vegetation based on the normalized difference water index and the spatial characteristics of the points along the profile. The normalized difference water index was created using the RGB and intensity data coupled to the LiDAR points. The mean vertical deviation of 0.14m found between the extracted and reference cross sections could mainly be attributed to the occurrence of water and partly to vegetation on the banks. In contrast to the cross-sectional area, the extracted width was not influenced by the environment (coefficient of determination R²=0.87). Water and vegetation influenced the extracted ditch characteristics, but the proposed method is still robust and therefore facilitates input data acquisition and improves accuracy of spatially explicit hydrological models.  aPublisher supplied data 3adata collection 3adrainage 3ahydrologic models 3alidar 3avegetation 3awatersheds 0aLiDAR 0aDitch 0aCross section 0aIntensity 0aRGB1 aDondeyne, Stefaan1 aVan Orshoven, Jos1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5756-71881 aDiels, Jan1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0317-82800 tITC journal.g2016 Dec., v. 53 p.64-75dElsevier B.V.wJournal:22337x1569-84327nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jag.2016.08.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03384naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100006600138245012400204300001600328500002000344520195200364592002802316650002002344650002202364650002302386650001602409650001902425650001502444650002002459650002602479650001502505650001602520650001102536650003702547700002202584700006802606700002702674700005702701773012202758856007302880852000902953655001202962IND60769067020221117173721.0220303e202203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076906702DNAL7 a10.1002/pca.30892doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRoshan, Abdulrahman A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8965-362710aBreaking the challenge of polyherbal quality control using UV and HPLC fingerprints combined with multivariate analysis  ap. 320-330.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aINTRODUCTION: Traditional herbal medicines are mostly composed of more than one herb which act synergistically; hence, there is high demand for proper quality control methods to ensure the consistent quality of polyherbal formulations. AIMS: Proposing a simple, reliable, and efficient method for the qualitative and quantitative analysis of a polyherbal product using multivariate analysis of ultraviolet–visible (UV‐Vis) spectroscopy or HPLC‐PDA data. METHODOLOGY: An antiobesity formula consisting of equal proportions of Trachyspermum ammi, Cuminum cyminum, and Origanum majorana was prepared as well as spiked with one of each herb simultaneously, representing accepted and unaccepted samples. Full factorial design (2ᵏ) was applied to study the effect of temperature, sonication, and stirring time for extraction optimisation. The HPLC and UV spectral fingerprints were separately subjected to multivariate analysis. The soft independent modelling of class analogy (SIMCA) and partial least squares (PLS) models were developed to segregate the accepted from the unaccepted samples and to predict the herbal composition in addition to the thymol content in each sample. RESULTS: The SIMCAᵘᵛ and SIMCAʰᵖˡᶜ models showed correct discrimination between the accepted and unaccepted samples with excellent selectivity and sensitivity. The PLSᵘᵛ, PLSʰᵖˡᶜ, and PLSᵗʰʸᵐ models showed excellent linearity and accuracy with R² > 0.98, slope close to 1, intercept close to 0, low root mean square error of calibration (RMSEC), and root mean square error of prediction (RMSEP) (close to 0). On validation, the PLS models correctly predicted the quantity of the three herbs and thymol content with ±5% accuracy. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates the reliability and efficiency of HPLC and UV spectroscopy coupled with multivariate statistical analysis (MVA) for ensuring the consistency of polyherbal preparations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCuminum cyminum 3aOriganum majorana 3aTrachyspermum ammi 3acalibration 3aphytochemicals 3aprediction 3aquality control 3aquantitative analysis 3asonication 3atemperature 3athymol 3aultraviolet-visible spectroscopy1 aHathout, Rania M.1 aEl‐Ahmady, Sherweit H.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5350-92391 aSingab, Abdelnasser B.1 aGad, Haidy A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2951-983X0 tPhytochemical analysis.g2022 Mar., v. 33, no. 2 p.320-330dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl58272x0958-03447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/pca.30893Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03435naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100005700147245009600204300001400300520185500314592002802169650002202197650001202219650001702231650001902248650001102267650001902278650001702297650001302314650001602327650001902343650001802362650002502380650001102405650001602416650001702432650001802449650001702467650002002484653003502504653002402539653001702563653001902580653002902599653002502628700001702653700002002670700002202690773009002712856008202802852000902884655001202893IND60567175220221116231933.0220523e201612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056717522DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jag.2016.08.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGerhards, Max1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2510-435410aWater stress detection in potato plants using leaf temperature, emissivity, and reflectance  ap. 27-39.  aWater stress is one of the most critical abiotic stressors limiting crop development. The main imaging and non-imaging remote sensing based techniques for the detection of plant stress (water stress and other types of stress) are thermography, visible (VIS), near- and shortwave infrared (NIR/SWIR) reflectance, and fluorescence. Just very recently, in addition to broadband thermography, narrowband (hyperspectral) thermal imaging has become available, which even facilitates the retrieval of spectral emissivity as an additional measure of plant stress. It is, however, still unclear at what stage plant stress is detectable with the various techniques. During summer 2014 a water treatment experiment was run on 60 potato plants (Solanum tuberosum L. Cilena) with one half of the plants watered and the other half stressed. Crop response was measured using broadband and hyperspectral thermal cameras and a VNIR/SWIR spectrometer. Stomatal conductance was measured using a leaf porometer. Various measures and indices were computed and analysed for their sensitivity towards water stress (Crop Water Stress Index (CWSI), Moisture Stress Index (MSI), Photochemical Reflectance Index (PRI), and spectral emissivity, amongst others). The results show that water stress as measured through stomatal conductance started on day 2 after watering was stopped. The fastest reacting, i.e., starting on day 7, indices were temperature based measures (e.g., CWSI) and NIR/SWIR reflectance based indices related to plant water content (e.g., MSI). Spectral emissivity reacted equally fast. Contrarily, visual indices (e.g., PRI) either did not respond at all or responded in an inconsistent manner. This experiment shows that pre-visual water stress detection is feasible using indices depicting leaf temperature, leaf water content and spectral emissivity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSolanum tuberosum 3acameras 3afluorescence 3aimage analysis 3aleaves 3aphotochemistry 3aplant stress 3apotatoes 3areflectance 3aremote sensing 3aspectrometers 3astomatal conductance 3asummer 3atemperature 3athermography 3awater content 3awater stress 3awater treatment 0aHyperspectral thermal infrared 0aSpectral emissivity 0aThermography 0aDrought stress 0aCrop water stress (CWSI) 0aSolanum tuberosum L.1 aRock, Gilles1 aSchlerf, Martin1 aUdelhoven, Thomas0 tITC journal.g2016 Dec., v. 53 p.27-39dElsevier B.V.wJournal:22337x1569-84327nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jag.2016.08.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02497naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245009200168300001400260520082500274592002801099650002201127650003701149650003701186650002201223650001101245650001301256650001501269650001101284650001901295650001501314650001501329650001201344650003401356650003301390650001101423650002101434650003801455650003701493650001301530653001901543653001901562653002001581653001601601700001601617700001201633700001501645700001901660700001801679700001601697700001601713773009701729856008401826852000901910655001201919IND60601104520221118034850.0180706e201401  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060110452DNAL7 a10.1016/j.powtec.2013.10.0182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJiang, Guohua10aPreparation of Ag-modified Zn2GeO4 nanorods for photo-degradation of organic pollutants  ap. 37-40.  aThe Zn2GeO4 nanorod photocatalysts with Ag doping and Ag decorating (Ag-modified Zn2GeO4) were synthesized by a mild solvothermal method.

The two loops of this molecular beacon are designed in such a manner that they consist of thrombin (Tmb) aptamer sequence and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) aptamer sequence, respectively, which are utilized to sense thrombin and ATP. The oligonucleotide forms double stem–loops in the absence of targets, yielding no fluorescence emission because of the FRET from the excited fluorophore to the proximal quencher. Upon addition of the target, the ATP or Tmb, its specific interaction with loop sequence of the hairpin structure induce the separation of reporter fluorophore and the fluorescence quencher of the molecular beacon, resulting in an increase of fluorescence response. Hence, the separate analysis of ATP and Tmb could be realized through only one designed molecular beacon. The detection limits were estimated to be 25nM for ATP and 12nM for Tmb, respectively. The results of this study should substantially broaden the perspective for future development of oligonucleotide probe for analysis of other analytes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadenosine triphosphate 3abiosensors 3adetection limit 3afluorescence 3aoligonucleotides 3athrombin 0aMolecular beacon 0aThrombin 0aAdenosine triphosphate 0aAptamer1 aDu, Zongfeng1 aYang, Limin1 aTang, Bo0 tBiosensors & bioelectronics.g2013 Mar. 15, v. 41 p.907-910dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11631x0956-56637nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bios.2012.10.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02216naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245007600171300001800247520104300265592002801308650001901336650001901355650002201374650001301396650002201409650002201431650000901453650001201462651001501474653002701489653002201516653002401538653002101562653001501583773013801598856008501736852000901821655001201830IND60674663920221118045014.0191028e20191110xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067466392DNAL7 a10.1080/09640568.2018.15407722doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aReis, Kimberley10aFive things government can do to encourage local food contingency plans  ap. 2295-2312.  aSevere weather events pose significant risks to food supply chains that are reliant upon critical infrastructures such as road and rail. Can local food procurement arrangements, and contingency plans based on those arrangements, help to ameliorate food shortage in times of crisis? This article explores how governments can empower communities to this end. A broader research project provides the basis of insights and recommendations to aid policy practitioners who seek to develop food-related disaster resilience at the community level. The findings call for the following: the adoption of policies that facilitate the procurement of local food; informing council planning; facilitating shared control with those who want these changes to occur; removing the barriers to change; and utilising a suite of consultation and engagement policies to these ends. It is argued that the Australian regional context of South-East Queensland, with its inherent issues of rapid population growth, has immediate relevance to international contexts.  aPublisher supplied data 3afood shortages 3ainfrastructure 3aissues and policy 3aplanning 3apopulation growth 3aresearch projects 3arisk 3aweather 3aQueensland 0alocal food procurement 0acontingency plans 0adisaster resilience 0arisk perceptions 0agovernance0 tJournal of environmental planning and management.g2019 Nov. 10, v. 62, no. 13 p.2295-2312dRoutledgewJournal:12206x1360-05597nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09640568.2018.15407723Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04465naa a2200649 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100005900138245020100197300001600398500002000414520192700434592002802361596006902389650002002458650002302478650001602501650005202517650002502569650001602594650001502610650001902625650002402644650001802668650002102686650004602707650002002753650002002773650001702793650002202810650002402832650002602856650001502882650003502897650001902932650001602951650002902967650001602996650001203012700005403024700006103078700006103139700005403200700005703254700005603311700005803367700005703425700005903482700005803541773012203599856007303721852000903794655001203803IND60769067220221117173723.0220303e202203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076906722DNAL7 a10.1002/pca.30882doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDoğan, Kübra,1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6816-814710aInstant determination of the artemisinin from various Artemisia annua L. extracts by LC‐ESI‐MS/MS and their in‐silico modelling and in vitro antiviral activity studies against SARS‐CoV‐2  ap. 303-319.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aINTRODUCTION: Numerous efforts in natural product drug development are reported for the treatment of Coronavirus. Based on the literature, among these natural plants Artemisia annua L. shows some promise for the treatment of SARS‐CoV‐2. OBJECTIVE: The main objective of our study was to determine artemisinin content by liquid chromatography electrospray ionisation tandem mass spectrometry (LC‐ESI‐MS/MS), to investigate the in vitro biological activity of artemisinin from the A. annua plants grown in Turkey with various extracted methods, to elaborate in silico activity against SARS‐CoV‐2 using molecular modelling. METHODOLOGY: Twenty‐one different extractions were applied. Direct and sequential extractions studies were compared with ultrasonic assisted maceration, Soxhlet, and ultra‐rapid determined artemisinin active molecules by LC‐ESI‐MS/MS methods. The inhibition of spike protein and main protease (3CL) enzyme activity of SARS‐CoV‐2 virus was assessed by time resolved fluorescence energy transfer (TR‐FRET) assay. RESULTS: Artemisinin content in the range 0.062–0.066%. Artemisinin showed significant inhibition of 3CL protease activity but not Spike/ACE‐2 binding. The 50% effective concentration (EC₅₀) of artemisinin against SARS‐CoV‐2 Spike pseudovirus was found greater than 50 μM (EC₄₅) in HEK293T cell line whereas the cell viability was 94% of the control (P < 0.01). The immunosuppressive effects of artemisinin on TNF‐α production on both pseudovirus and lipopolysaccharide (LPS)‐induced THP‐1 cells were found significant in a dose dependent manner. CONCLUSION: Further studies of these extracts for COVID‐19 treatment will shed light to seek alternative treatment options. Moreover, these natural extracts can be used as an additional treatment option with medicines, as well as prophylactic use can be very beneficial for patients.  aPublisher supplied data  a18AG003cScientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey 3aArtemisia annua 3aCOVID-19 infection 3aPseudovirus 3aSevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 3aantiviral properties 3aartemisinin 3acell lines 3acell viability 3acomputer simulation 3adose response 3adrug development 3aelectrospray ionization mass spectrometry 3aenergy transfer 3aenzyme activity 3afluorescence 3aimmunosuppression 3alipopolysaccharides 3aliquid chromatography 3amaceration 3amedian effective concentration 3aphytochemicals 3aproteinases 3atandem mass spectrometry 3aultrasonics 3aviruses1 aErol, Ebru1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6342-42981 aDidem Orhan, Muge1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9014-38381 aDegirmenci, Zehra1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0285-13621 aKan, Tugce1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8116-12221 aGungor, Aysen1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4955-80591 aYasa, Belkis1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7962-61691 aAvsar, Timucin1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8841-48111 aCetin, Yuksel1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5101-38701 aDurdagi, Serdar1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0426-09051 aGuzel, Mustafa1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1423-04350 tPhytochemical analysis.g2022 Mar., v. 33, no. 2 p.303-319dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl58272x0958-03447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/pca.30883Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02259naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100003200146245008000178300001600258500001400274520085800288592002801146650002201174650001001196650001501206650002201221650001701243650001401260650001001274650001501284650001701299650001901316650001401335650002401349650001201373653001901385653001101404653002201415653001701437653001601454700002101470700001801491700002001509700002401529773012201553856008101675852000901756655001201765IND60697979820221121202220.0200712e202008  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069797982DNAL7 a10.1016/j.pt.2020.05.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDos Santos Pacheco, Nicolas10aEvolution, Composition, Assembly, and Function of the Conoid in Apicomplexa  ap. 688-704.  aNAL-light  aThe phylum Apicomplexa has been defined by the presence of the apical complex, a structure composed of secretory organelles and specific cytoskeletal elements. A conspicuous feature of the apical complex in many apicomplexans is the conoid, a hollow tapered barrel structure composed of tubulin fibers. In Toxoplasma gondii, the apical complex is a central site of convergence for calcium-related and lipid-mediated signaling pathways that coordinate conoid protrusion, microneme secretion, and actin polymerization, to initiate gliding motility. Through cutting-edge technologies, great progress has recently been made in discovering the structural subcomponents and proteins implicated in the biogenesis and stability of the apical complex and, in turn, these discoveries have shed new light on the function and evolution of this definitive structure.  aPublisher supplied data 3aToxoplasma gondii 3aactin 3abiogenesis 3achemical elements 3acytoskeleton 3aevolution 3alight 3aorganelles 3aparasitology 3apolymerization 3asecretion 3asignal transduction 3atubulin 0aapical complex 0aconoid 0aapical polar ring 0amicrotubules 0aApicomplexa1 aTosetti, Nicolò1 aKoreny, Ludek1 aWaller, Ross F.1 aSoldati, Dominique,0 tTrends in parasitology.g2020 Aug., v. 36, no. 8 p.688-704dElsevier LtdaElsevier LtdwJournal:6336x1471-49227nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.pt.2020.05.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04007naa a2200937 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001600150245014100166300001600307520163800323592002801961650001801989650001302007650001802020650001602038650000902054650003002063650001202093650001302105650001302118650002102131650001102152650001102163650001602174650000902190650001802199650002302217650001502240650001602255650001202271650001702283650001402300650001502314650002902329650002602358653000902384653001002393653000802403653000902411653000902420653001002429653001002439653001102449653001102460653000902471653000802480653001002488653001002498653000902508653000902517653001102526653000702537653000702544653000902551653001102560653000902571653001202580653000902592653000902601653000802610653000802618653000902626653000802635653001602643653001502659653001502674653002302689653001102712653002502723700006002748700001602808700002002824773011902844856008502963852000903048655001203057IND60525847820221119084252.0180829e201603  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052584782DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbagen.2015.12.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXia, Mengna10aMapping the response of human fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) promoter to serum availability and lipoic acid in HepG2 hepatoma cells  ap. 498-507.  aThe hormone-like polypeptide, fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21), is a major modulator of lipid and glucose metabolism and an exploratory treatment strategy for obesity related metabolic disorders. The costs of recombinant FGF21 and mode of delivery by injection are important constraints to its wide therapeutic use. The stimulation of endogenous FGF21 production through diet is being explored as an alternative approach. To that end, we examined the mechanism(s) by which serum manipulation and lipoic acid (a dietary activator of FGF21) induce FGF21 in human hepatocellular carcinoma HepG2 cells. Serum withdrawal markedly induced FGF21 mRNA levels (88 fold) and FGF21 secreted in the media (19 fold). Lipoic acid induced FGF21 mRNA 7 fold above DMSO-treated control cells and FGF21 secretion 3 fold. These effects were several-fold greater than those of PPARα agonist, Wy14643, which failed to induce FGF21 above and beyond the induction seen with serum withdrawal. The use of transcription inhibitor, actinomycin D, revealed that de novo mRNA synthesis drives FGF21 secretion in response to serum starvation. Four previously unrecognized loci in FGF21 promoter were nucleosome depleted and enriched in acetylated histone H3 revealing their role as transcriptional enhancers and putative transcription factor binding sites. FGF21 did not accumulate to a significant degree in induced HepG2 cells, which secreted FGF21 time dependently in media. We conclude that lipoic acid cell signaling connects with the transcriptional upregulation of FGF21 and it may prove to be a safe and affordable means to stimulate FGF21 production.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactinomycin D 3aagonists 3abinding sites 3ablood serum 3adiet 3afibroblast growth factors 3aglucose 3ahepatoma 3ahistones 3ahuman cell lines 3ahumans 3alipids 3alipoic acid 3aloci 3amessenger RNA 3ametabolic diseases 3ametabolism 3anucleosomes 3aobesity 3apolypeptides 3asecretion 3astarvation 3atranscription (genetics) 3atranscription factors 0aACTB 0aCPT1A 0aCBP 0aCREB 0aDHLA 0aElk-1 0aElk-4 0aENCODE 0aERK1/2 0aERK5 0aETS 0aFAIRE 0aFGF21 0aFGFR 0aFUT1 0aHMOX 1 0aIR 0aLA 0aMAPK 0aPPARα 0aPPIA 0ap38MAPK 0aPPRE 0aSPZ1 0aSRF 0aTCF 0aTRED 0aTSS 0aFAIRE assay 0aNucleosome 0aHistone H3 0aDihydrolipoic acid 0aPPARα 0aFucosyltransferase 11 aErickson, Anjeza1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9303-07591 aYi, Xiaohua1 aMoreau, Régis,0 tBiochimica et biophysica acta.g2016 Mar., v. 1860, no. 3 p.498-507dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11872x0304-41657nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbagen.2015.12.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04225naa a2200733 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003800113040001800151100002100169245014900190300001800339520195300357592002802310650002502338650002102363650001102384650003502395650001502430650001502445650001202460650001602472650001802488650000902506650001402515650001102529650001602540650001302556650001202569650001902581650008002600650001402680650002902694650002302723650002002746650002402766650001102790650004302801650005302844650007902897650003102976650001203007650001303019650002403032650004603056650002403102651001103126651001403137651001103151653001503162653002503177653002103202653002503223653001503248653001203263700001503275700001303290773011603303856005103419852000903470655001203479IND50087228120221119111959.0140412e20121001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5008722812DNAL7 a228919792pmid7 a10.1080/19440049.2012.7149082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNaustvoll, L.-J.10aMonitoring of Dinophysis species and diarrhetic shellfish toxins in Flødevigen Bay, Norway: inter-annual variability over a 25-year time-series  ap. 1605-1615.  aThe accumulation of phycotoxins in bivalve mussels associated with mussels feeding on toxic phytoplankton is a well-known phenomenon in Norway. Regular monitoring for 25 years has revealed that accumulation of Diarrhetic Shellfish poisoning (DSP) toxins in mussels is the main phycotoxin problem along the Norwegian coast. The aim of this study was to evaluate possible trends over time of Dinophysis spp. and DSP as well as possible correlation between abundance of Dinophysis spp. and toxin accumulation in mussels, as based on intensive and regular monitoring at the southern coast of Norway at Flødevigen Bay. The main source organism causing a risk of DSP in Norway is Dinophysis acuta. However, it cannot be excluded that other Dinophysis spp., e.g. D. acuminata and D. norvegica, may contribute to the total accumulation of toxins. The variability in the occurrence of these species is high at both short- and long-term; between days and between years. There are, however, some important overall patterns in the occurrence of the species during the last decades. Dinophysis acuminata and D. norvegica have mainly been abundant from March to December, whereas D. acuta has typically occurred in late summer and autumn (August–December). For all three species we have observed a narrowing of the peak season since 2002 at the same time as they have become less abundant. Coincident with these changes, the problem of the accumulation of DSP toxins in mussels along the southern coast of Norway has declined significantly, but it is still mainly restricted to the autumn. Why the cell concentration of Dinophysis spp. has declined after 2002 is not obvious, but this has occurred in a period with relatively high summer temperatures. The relatively simultaneous changes in physical, chemical and biological factors of the pelagic ecosystem along the southern coast of Norway indicate that complicated ecological interactions may be involved.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDinophysis acuminata 3aDinophysis acuta 3aautumn 3adiarrhetic shellfish poisoning 3aecosystems 3amonitoring 3amussels 3aphycotoxins 3aphytoplankton 3arisk 3ashellfish 3asummer 3atemperature 3atoxicity 2aAnimals 2aClimate Change 2aDinoflagellidaxgrowth & developmentxisolation & purificationxmetabolism. 2aEcosystem 2aEnvironmental Monitoring 2aFood Contamination 2aFood Inspection 2aHarmful Algal Bloom 2aHumans 2aMarine Toxinsxanalysisxbiosynthesis. 2aMytilus edulisxchemistryxgrowth & development. 2aPhytoplanktonxgrowth & developmentxisolation & purificationxmetabolism. 2aReproducibility of Results 2aSeasons 2aSeawater 2aShellfishxanalysis 2aShellfish Poisoningxprevention & control 2aSpecies Specificity 3aNorway 0aNorth Sea 0aNorway 0amonitoring 0aDinophysis acuminate 0aDinophysis acuta 0aDinophysis norvegica 0aDSP toxins 0amussels1 aGustad, E.1 aDahl, E.0 tFood additives & contaminants.g2012 Oct. 1, v. 29, no. 10 p.1605-1615dTaylor & Francis Groupx1944-00577nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/19440049.2012.714908  aDNAL 7aarticle02630naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094024002800125024002200153024001900175040001800194100002100212245009800233300001800331506007600349506003100425520106600456592002801522596005101550596000901601506003701610650001601647650001901663650002001682650003801702650001101740650002601751650002201777650001501799650002201814650001801836650002001854700002001874700002201894700001901916773012901935856007502064852000902139655001202148IND60676970520221215142827.0191122e20191121xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067697052DNAL7 a10.1039/c9ay01757g2chorus7 a10.1039/c9ay01757g2doi7 aPMC70596362pmcid7 a321485622pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRister, Alana L.10aMicroscale serum extraction method for the simultaneous analysis of corticosterone and lipids  ap. 5746-5749.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aCHORUS License Information  aCorticosterone is an important steroid for the regulation of metabolism and stress response. Existing methods for the measurement of corticosterone include radioimmunoassay (RIA), enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS). While each of these approaches have their advantages, RIAs use radioactive isotopes that necessitate specially regulated usage and disposal. Furthermore, both ELISAs and RIAs require expensive kits and can only measure a single analyte. In this study, we establish a new sample preparation technique based on a modified Folch extraction that allows for the simultaneous isolation of corticosterone and lipids from serum. The extract is then analyzed by LC-MS. Using only 5 μL of serum, quantification of corticosterone was achieved with coefficients of variation at 3% or less and a detection limit of 0.12 μM. Overall, the results of this study should be beneficial to the measurement of circulating corticosterone and lipids for a variety of studies using small volumes of samples.  aPublisher supplied data  cNational Institute of General Medical Sciences  cUSDA0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3ablood serum 3acorticosterone 3adetection limit 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3alipids 3aliquid chromatography 3amass spectrometry 3ametabolism 3aradioimmunoassays 3aradionuclides 3astress response1 aBidne, Katie L.1 aWood, Jennifer R.1 aDodds, Eric D.0 tAnalytical methods.g2019 Nov. 21, v. 11, no. 45 p.5746-5749dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26912x1759-96797nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c9ay01757g3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03194naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001100147245009300158300001600251520183800267592002802105650001202133650001902145650001902164650002102183650001802204650001302222650001302235650002102248650001502269650001602284650001902300650002202319650001002341650002102351653001702372653001202389653001502401653001102416653001102427700002002438700001602458700002102474700002202495773009202517856008202609852000902691655001202700IND60567175720221116232137.0220523e201612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056717572DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jag.2016.08.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHadi, 14aThe accuracy of large-area forest canopy cover estimation using Landsat in boreal region  ap. 118-127.  aLarge area prediction of continuous field of tree cover i.e., canopy cover (CC) using Earth observation data is of high interest in practical forestry, ecology, and climate change mitigation activities. We report the accuracy of using Landsat images for CC prediction in boreal forests validated with field reference plots (N=250) covering large variation in latitude, forest structure, species composition, and site type. We tested two statistical models suitable for estimating CC: the beta regression (BetaReg) and random forest (RanFor). Landsat-based predictors utilized include individual bands, spectral vegetation indices (SVI), and Tasseled cap (Tass) features. Additionally, we tested an alternative model based on spectral mixture analysis (SMA). Finally, we carried out a first validation in boreal forests of the recently published Landsat Tree Cover Continuous (TCC) global product. Results showed simple BetaReg with red band reflectance provided the highest prediction accuracy (leave-site-out RMSECV 13.7%; R²CV 0.59; biasCV 0.5%). Spectral transformations into SVI and Tass did not improve accuracy. Including additional predictors did not significantly improve accuracy either. Nonlinear model RanFor did not outperform BetaReg. The alternative SMA model did not outperform the empirical models. However, empirical models cannot resolve the underestimation of high cover and overestimation of low cover. SMA prediction errors appeared less dependent on forest structure, while there seemed to be a potential for improvement by accounting for endmember variability of different tree species. Finally, using temporally concurrent observations, we showed the reasonably good accuracy of Landsat TCC product in boreal forests (RMSE 13.0%; R² 0.53; bias −2.1%), however with a tendency to underestimate high cover.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLandsat 3aboreal forests 3aclimate change 3aempirical models 3aforest canopy 3aforestry 3alatitude 3anonlinear models 3aprediction 3areflectance 3aremote sensing 3aspecies diversity 3atrees 3avegetation index 0aCanopy cover 0aLandsat 0aTree cover 0aBoreal 0aForest1 aKorhonen, Lauri1 aHovi, Aarne1 aRönnholm, Petri1 aRautiainen, Miina0 tITC journal.g2016 Dec., v. 53 p.118-127dElsevier B.V.wJournal:22337x1569-84327nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jag.2016.08.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01598naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002300139245015100162300001400313520045700327592002800784650002300812650002300835650002900858650001600887650002900903650001400932700002500946700001700971700002400988700003101012700002001043773010101063856007501164852000901239655001201248IND60578863720180316000000.0170814e20150102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057886372DNAL7 a10.1021/ol50324092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCastelló, Luis M.10aPd-Catalyzed Cross-Coupling of Aryllithium Reagents with 2-Alkoxy-Substituted Aryl Chlorides: Mild and Efficient Synthesis of 3,3′-Diaryl BINOLs  ap. 62-65.  aPalladium-catalyzed cross-coupling of aryllithium reagents with 2-alkoxy-substituted aryl chlorides is described.

This study used the chemical properties of stormwater along with δ¹⁵N-NO₃⁻ and δ¹⁸O-NO₃⁻ isotopes to identify the transport and sources of nitrate within an urban catchment. The results showed that the NO₃-N concentration and total dissolved nitrogen (TDN) composition differed among roof runoff, road runoff, and drainage runoff. The highest NO₃⁻N concentration was found in roof runoff and NH₃-N dominated the TDN composition. However, the erosion of pervious surfaces and litter may have led to higher DON/TDN values in road runoff. The TDN composition of drainage runoff was consistent with that of roof runoff. Furthermore, among the various rainfall characteristics, the depth and intensity of rainfall were significantly correlated with the NO₃-N concentrations in roof runoff and road runoff, while antecedent dry days had little effect. According to a Bayesian mixing model, the average contributions of the nitrate load in drainage runoff were ranked as road runoff (51.6%) > rainwater (29.2%) > and roof runoff (15%), which is consistent with the results of previous studies. Rainwater nitrate may have ranked second due to the confluence time, pollution level, and other factors that made rainwater reduce the pollution characteristics of roof runoff. The dominant contribution of road runoff to the NO₃⁻N concentration of drainage runoff could be attributed to the large runoff volume. Hence, effective measures should be taken to minimize the NO₃-N concentration in roof runoff, while runoff volume reduction should be the primary concern for controlling road runoff pollution. This work is helpful for obtaining a better understanding of the transport and sources of nitrate that vary dynamically within different hydrological flow pathways, and the outcomes are expected to enhance targeted measures to mitigate nitrate pollution in urban water systems.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBayesian theory 3adrainage 3aenvironment 3anitrates 3arain 3astormwater 3awatersheds 0aNitrate 0aStormwater pollution 0aTransport process 0aSource quantification 0aStormwater management1 aMa, Yukun1 aZhang, Xiaoyue1 aShen, Zhenyao0 tScience of the total environment.g2022 Feb. 01, v. 806 p.150281-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.1502813Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04275naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100002000138245011500158500002000273520239300293592002802686596007402714596004802788596007902836596004902915596007102964596007703035650001703112650001703129650001803146650001903164650002403183650002203207650001303229650002203242650001103264650002103275650001003296650001703306650001603323651001203339700001803351700001803369700001903387700002203406700001903428700001803447700006303465773012303528856007303651852000903724655001203733IND60769067920221117173714.0220303e202203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076906792DNAL7 a10.1002/eap.25052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVirkkala, Raimo10aDeveloping fine‐grained nationwide predictions of valuable forests using biodiversity indicator bird species  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe use of indicator species in forest conservation and management planning can facilitate enhanced preservation of biodiversity from the negative effects of forestry and other uses of land. However, this requires detailed and spatially comprehensive knowledge of the habitat preferences and distributions of selected focal indicator species. Unfortunately, due to limited resources for field surveys, only a small proportion of the occurrences of focal species is usually known. This shortcoming can be circumvented by using modeling techniques to predict the spatial distribution of suitable sites for the target species. Airborne laser scanning (ALS) and other remote sensing (RS) techniques have the potential to provide useful environmental data covering systematically large areas for these purposes. Here, we focused on six bird of prey and woodpecker species known to be good indicators of boreal forest biodiversity values. We used known nest sites of the six indicator species based on nestling ringing records. Thus, the most suitable nesting sites of these species provide important information for biodiversity‐friendly forest management and conservation planning. We developed fine‐grained, that is, 96 × 96 m grid cell resolution, predictive maps across the whole of Finland of the suitable nesting habitats based on ALS and other RS data and spatial information on the distribution of important forest stands for the six studied biodiversity indicator bird species based on nesting‐habitat suitability modeling, that is, the MaxEnt model. Habitat preferences of the study species, as determined by MaxEnt, were in line with the previous knowledge of species‐habitat relations. The proportion of suitable habitats of these species in protected areas (PAs) was considerable, but our analysis also revealed many potentially high‐quality forest stands outside PAs. However, many of these sites are increasingly threatened by logging because of increased pressures for using forests for bioeconomy and forest industry based on National Forest Strategy. Predicting habitat suitability based on information on the nest sites of indicator species provides a new tool for systematic conservation planning over large areas in boreal forests in Europe, and a corresponding approach would also be feasible and recommendable elsewhere where similar data are available.  aPublisher supplied data  aFinnish ecosystem observatorycMinistry of the Environment in Finland  aFEOcMinistry of the Environment in Finland  aPA network in the changing climatecMinistry of the Environment in Finland  aSUMIcMinistry of the Environment in Finland  a312559cStrategic Research Council (SRC) at the Academy of Finland  aIBC‐CarboncStrategic Research Council (SRC) at the Academy of Finland 3abiodiversity 3abioeconomics 3abirds of prey 3aboreal forests 3aforest conservation 3aforest industries 3ahabitats 3aindicator species 3amodels 3anational forests 3anests 3aspatial data 3awoodpeckers 3aFinland1 aLeikola, Niko1 aKujala, Heini1 aKivinen, Sonja1 aHurskainen, Pekka1 aKuusela, Saija1 aValkama, Jari1 aHeikkinen, Risto K.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4190-51080 tEcological applications.g2022 Mar., v. 32, no. 2 p.e2505-dJohn Wiley & Sons, Inc.wJournal:jnl47193x1051-07617nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/eap.25053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03517naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002100149245008100170520252900251592002802780650001602808650001402824650001402838650000902852650001302861650001502874650002202889651001102911700002502922700001902947773013302966856008303099852000903182655001203191IND60751397520221121083542.0210925e20210826xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075139752DNAL7 a10.3390/agriculture110908092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPerros, Nikolas 10aSpatial Analysis of Agronomic Data and UAV Imagery for Rice Yield Estimation  aIn this study, a spatial analysis of agronomic and remote sensing data is carried out to derive accurate rice crop yield estimation. The variability of a series of vegetation indices (VIs) was calculated from remote sensing data obtained via a commercial UAS platform (e-Bee) at four dates (per stage of development), and the development of estimation models was conducted. The study area is located in the region of Chalastra (municipality of Thessaloniki, North Greece) and the primary data were obtained during the 2016 growing season. These data include ultra-high resolution remote sensing multispectral images of 18 plots totaling 58 hectares of Ronaldo and Gladio rice crop varieties, 97 sample point data related to yield, and many other pieces of information recorded in the producer’s field log. Ten simple and compound VIs were calculated, and the evolution of their values during the growing season as well as their comparative correlation were studied. A study of the usability of each VI was conducted for the different phenological stages of the cultivation and the variance of VIs and yield; the more correlated VIs were identified. Furthermore, three types of multitemporal VI were calculated from combinations of VIs from different dates, and their contribution to improving yield prediction was studied. As Ronaldo is a Japonica type of rice variety and Gladio is Indica type, they behave differently in terms of maturation time (Gladio is approximately 20 days earlier) and the value of every VI is affected by changes in plant physiology and phenology. These differences between the two varieties are reflected in the multitemporal study of the single-date VIs but also in the study of the values of the multitemporal VIs. In conclusion, Ronaldo’s yield is strongly dependent on multitemporal NDVI (VI₆ₜₕ Jᵤₗy + VI₃₀ Aᵤg, R² = 0.76), while Gladio’s yield is strongly dependent on single-date NDVI (6 July, R² = 0.88). The compound VIs RERDVI and MCARI1 have the highest yield prediction (R² = 0.77) for Ronaldo (VI₆ₜₕ Jᵤₗy + VI₃₀ Aᵤg) and Gladio (R² = 0.95) when calculated in the booting stage, respectively. For the Ronaldo variety, the examination of the multitemporal VIs increases yield prediction accuracy, while in the case of the Gladio variety the opposite is observed. The capabilities of multitemporal VIs in yield estimation by combining UAVs with more flights during the different growth stages can improve management and the cultivation practices.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagriculture 3aevolution 3aphenology 3arice 3avariance 3avegetation 3ayield forecasting 3aGreece1 aKalivas, Dionissios 1 aGiovos, Rigas 0 tAgriculture (Basel).g2021 Aug. 26, v. 11, no. 9dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:12387x2077-04727nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agriculture110908093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04343naa a2200757 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100002700166245010500193300001600298520202000314592002802334650001302362650001202375650003102387650001202418650001802430650001702448650001802465650001202483650001102495650001702506650001802523650001102541650001102552650001302563650001402576650001702590650000902607650001502616650001602631650001702647650001202664650003202676650001202708650006102720650001602781650001402797650003702811650003202848650002602880650002302906650001702929650001802946650000902964650000902973650002902982650007303011650008003084650001703164650005103181650001703232650002403249700002703273700002503300700001903325700002803344773011103372856008103483852000903564655001203573IND50060651920221120143519.0141111e20130307xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006065192DNAL7 a233139512pmid7 a10.1016/j.jep.2012.12.0532doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPinheiro, Mariana M.G.10aAnti-inflammatory activity of ethanol extract and fractions from Couroupita guianensis Aublet leaves  ap. 324-330.  aETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Couroupita guianensis Aublet, ‘macacarecuia’, ‘abricó-de-macaco’, ‘castanha-de-macaco’ and ‘amêndoa-dos-andes’, is found in tropical regions and is widely used in the treatment of tumors, pain, and inflammatory processes. AIM OF THE STUDY: Ethanol extract and hexane and ethyl acetate fractions were evaluated in models of inflammatory pain (formalin-induced licking) and acute inflammation (carrageenan-induced peritonitis). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Ethanol extract, hexane and ethyl acetate fractions (10, 30 or 100mg/kg, p.o.) and the reference drugs dexamethasone (5mg/kg), morphine (5mg/kg, s.c.), and acetylsalicylic acid (100mg/kg, p.o.) were tested in formalin-induced licking response and carrageenan-induced peritonitis. RESULTS: All three doses from Couroupita guianensis fractions significantly reduced the time that the animal spent licking the formalin-injected paw in first and second phases. However, only higher doses (30 and 100mg/kg) were able to inhibit the leukocyte migration into the peritoneal cavity after carrageenan injection. In this model, the 100mg/kg dose almost abolished the cell migration. It was also observed that protein concentration resulted from extravasation to the peritoneum and nitric oxide (NO) productions were significantly reduced. Cytokines production was differently affected by the treatment. TNF-α production was reduced after ethanol extract and ethyl acetate fraction pre-treatment whereas hexane fraction had effect only with 100mg/kg dose. IL-1β production was inhibited only after hexane fraction pre-treatment. The inhibitory effect observed was not due to a direct cytotoxic effect on cells nor to a NO-scavenger activity. The effect was due to a direct inhibition on NO production by the cells. CONCLUSIONS: The results show that Couroupita guianensis fractions have anti-inflammatory effect, partly due to a reduction on cell migration and a inhibition on cytokines and inflammatory mediators production.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetates 3aanimals 3aanti-inflammatory activity 3aaspirin 3acell movement 3acytotoxicity 3adexamethasone 3aethanol 3ahexane 3ainflammation 3ainterleukin-1 3aleaves 3amodels 3amorphine 3aneoplasms 3anitric oxide 3apain 3aperitoneum 3aperitonitis 3apretreatment 3atropics 3atumor necrosis factor-alpha 2aAnimals 2aAnti-Inflammatory Agentsxpharmacologyxtherapeutic use. 2aCarrageenan 2aCell Line 2aCell Migration Assays, Leukocyte 2aCell Survivalxdrug effects 2aCytokinesximmunology 2aEthanolxchemistry 2aFormaldehyde 2aLecythidaceae 2aMale 2aMice 2aNitric Oxidexmetabolism 2aPainxchemically inducedxdrug therapyximmunologyxphysiopathology. 2aPeritonitisxchemically inducedxdrug therapyximmunologyxphysiopathology. 2aPhytotherapy 2aPlant Extractsxpharmacologyxtherapeutic use. 2aPlant Leaves 2aSolventsxchemistry1 aFernandes, Sidnei B.O.1 aFingolo, Catarina E.1 aBoylan, Fábio1 aFernandes, Patrícia D.0 tJournal of ethnopharmacology.g2013 Mar. 7, v. 146, no. 1 p.324-330dElsevier Ireland Ltdx0378-87417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jep.2012.12.0533Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02789naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002800150245008600178300001600264520144400280592002801724650001401752650001401766650002301780650001401803650001601817650001801833650002401851650002101875653000801896653001901904653001301923700002501936700002401961700003001985700002602015700003002041700006802071700002502139773009702164856008502261852000902346655001202355IND60755885420221122040735.0220103e202201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075588542DNAL7 a10.1016/j.renene.2021.10.0712doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMiladinović, Marija R.10aTransesterification of used cooking sunflower oil catalyzed by hazelnut shell ash  ap. 103-113.  aHazelnut shell ash was investigated as a new base catalyst for the transesterification of used cooking sunflower oil to biodiesel. To understand its catalytic properties, the prepared ash was characterized by EDX, XRD, TGA/DTA, Hg porosimetry, N₂ physisorption, FE-SEM, and basic strength measurements. The effects of the catalyst loading in the range of 1–5% of the oil weight and the methanol-to-oil molar ratio of 6:1–18:1 on the kinetics of the fatty acid methyl esters synthesis were established. Moreover, the leaching and reusability of the catalyst were assessed. The obtained results revealed that hazelnut shell ash was mostly composed of K, Ca, and Mg. The highest ester content (98%) was achieved at the catalyst loading of 5%, the methanol-to-oil molar ratio of 12:1, and the reaction time of 10 min. The contribution of homogeneous catalysis because of the catalyst leaching was confirmed but did not determine the overall reaction rate. The catalyst can be reused after the recalcination at 800 °C for 2 h achieving the high methyl esters content (>96%) in 30 min after three subsequent runs. The overall reaction followed the pseudo-first-order kinetics with respect to triacylglycerols. A linear relationship between the apparent reaction rate constant and the catalyst loading and the methanol-to-oil molar ratio was determined. The determined value of the reaction rate constant was 0.0576 dm⁶/(min·mol²).  aPublisher supplied data 3abiodiesel 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3ahazelnuts 3aporosimetry 3asunflower oil 3atransesterification 3atriacylglycerols 0aAsh 0aHazelnut shell 0aKinetics1 aKrstić, Jugoslav B.1 aZdujić, Miodrag V.1 aVeselinović, Ljiljana M.1 aVeljović, Djordje N.1 aBanković-Ilić, Ivana B.1 aStamenković, Olivera S.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9981-58451 aVeljković, Vlada B.0 tRenewable energy.g2022 Jan., v. 183 p.103-113dElsevier LtdwJournal:11970x0960-14817nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.renene.2021.10.0713Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01428naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002200149245010000171300001800271520046600289592002800755650001400783650002300797650002300820650001100843650001600854700002600870700002900896773010700925856008501032852000901117655001201126IND60579169720221119103717.0170816e20160916xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057916972DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.orglett.6b020312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShmatova, Olga I.10aFrom Cyclic CF3-ketimines to a Family of Trifluoromethylated Nazlinine and Trypargine Analogues  ap. 4494-4497.  aAn efficient (one- and two-step) synthesis of trifluoromethylated derivatives of the natural alkaloids nazlinine, trypargine, and homotrypargine was elaborated.

Alginate, a polysaccharide from brown algae, is commonly studied as a wound dressing owing to its biocompatibility and biodegradability. To improve its therapeutic features and thereby increase wound healing, papain (a proteolytic enzyme from Carica papaya latex) was proposed to be incorporated. Papain is capable of promoting the debridement of devitalized or necrotic tissues. The development of dressing based on alginate and papain aggregates the healing properties of both materials. In addition, the adsorption on a support can stabilize the enzyme structure and permits its release in a controlled manner. The optimal conditions for immobilization were evaluated (initial concentration, temperature, and pH), and the amount immobilized was measured by Bradford assay. The enzyme activity stability over 28 days was measured. The release profile was determined using Franz cell. In vitro cytotoxicity assays were performed using fibroblasts and keratinocytes. Optimal immobilization conditions were identified in a neutral medium at a papain concentration of 20 mg/mL and temperature of 25 °C. The enzyme remained active after immobilization (80 % of its initial activity), and the matrix protected the enzyme from deactivation (70 % reduction on the matrix compared to 94 % in a buffer solution). Franz cell displayed a release profile of 64.1 % of the enzyme after 24 h. The biological assays indicated a bioactive material with proteolytic properties.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCarica papaya 3aadsorption 3aalginates 3abiocompatibility 3abiodegradability 3acytotoxicity 3adebridement 3aenzyme activity 3afibroblasts 3ahumans 3akeratinocytes 3alatex 3apH 3apapain 3apharmaceutical industry 3aproteolysis 3atemperature 0aWound dressing 0aAlginate 0aImmobilization 0aBiomaterial1 aVasconcelos, Niédja Fittipaldi1 aAndrade, Fabia Karine1 aRosa, Morsyleide de Freitas1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5224-97781 aVieira, Rodrigo Silveira1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4569-96550 tColloids and surfaces.g2020 Oct., v. 194 p.111222-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11946x0927-77657nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfb.2020.1112223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04464naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245017300164300001600337520303200353592002803385650001503413650001403428650002103442650001803463650001703481650001103498650002603509650002303535650001503558650001703573650001303590650001303603650002103616650001503637650001603652650001203668650001803680650001803698650001203716650001603728651001103744700002103755773011503776852000903891856008203900655001203982IND60439932720221121071622.0180619e200804  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6043993272DNAL7 a10.1007/s11104-008-9538-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSmal, Halina14aThe effect of afforestation with Scots pine (Pinus silvestris L.) of sandy post-arable soils on their selected properties. II. Reaction, carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus  ap. 171-187.  aDespite the extensive literature on the effect on soil properties of afforestation of former arable land, we still lack full understanding of whether the changes proceed in the same direction and at the same rate, and of how long is required to achieve a state of soil equilibrium typical of a natural forest ecosystem. Therefore, as part of a study comparing post-arable sandy soils (Dystric Arenosols) afforested with Scots pine (Pinus silvestris L.) with arable soils and soils of continuous coniferous forests, the range and direction of changes in pH, organic carbon (Cₒᵣg), total nitrogen (Nₜₒₜ), ammonium (N-NH₄) and nitrates (N-NO₃) in soil solution, total (Pₜₒₜ) and available (Pₐᵥ) phosphorus were determined. The studies were carried out in south-east Poland (51°30′-51°37′N, 22°20′-22°35′E). Ten paired sites of afforested soils (five with 14- to 17-year-old stands and five with 32- to 36-year-old stands) with adjacent cultivated fields, and five sites of continuous forest with present stands of ca. 130–150 years old were selected. Soil samples were taken from the whole thickness of master horizons and, in the case of the A horizon of the afforested soils, from three layers: 0–5 (A₀–₅), 5–10 (A₅–₁₀) and 10–20 cm (A₁₀–₂₀). The cultivated soils in the Ap horizon showed higher pH (by ca. 1.0 unit), lower Cₒᵣg and C:N, similar Nₜₒₜ, lower N-NH₄, higher N-NO₃, higher Pₜₒₜ and Pₐᵥ contents compared with the Ah horizon of continuous forest soils. The results indicated decreased soil pH in the former plough layer of the afforested soils, with the greatest decrease observed in the 0–5 cm layer. In these soils, the Cₒᵣg content was considerably higher in the A₀–₅ layer, but lower in the two deeper layers and in the whole A horizon (0–20 cm) compared with the Ap horizon of the arable soils. The results indicate that the Cₒᵣg content, after an initial phase of decline, again achieved a level characteristic of arable soils. The Nₜₒₜ content in all layers of the A horizon of the afforested soils was lower than in the Ap horizon of the arable soils, and showed a reduction with stand age, especially in deeper layers. The C:N ratios in the mineral topsoil increased with stand age. N-NH₄ content increased and N-NO₃ decreased after afforestation. The Pₜₒₜ and Pₐᵥ contents in all layers and in the whole A horizon of the afforested soils, on stands of both ages, was lower than in the Ap of the cultivated soils. From the results, it could be concluded that, after more than 30 years of tree growth, the soils of the A horizon were still more similar to arable than to continuous forest soils with respect to Cₒᵣg, Pₜₒₜ and Pₐᵥ. With respect to pH, N-NH₄ and N-NO₃, especially in the 0–5 cm layer, they were more similar to continuous forest soils than to cultivated soils, but with respect to Nₜₒₜ and C:N ratio they were somewhere in between.  aPublisher supplied data 3aA horizons 3aArenosols 3aPinus sylvestris 3aafforestation 3aarable soils 3acarbon 3acarbon nitrogen ratio 3aconiferous forests 3aecosystems 3aforest soils 3anitrates 3anitrogen 3anitrogen content 3aphosphorus 3asandy soils 3asoil pH 3asoil sampling 3asoil solution 3atopsoil 3atree growth 3aPoland1 aOlszewska, Marta0 tPlant and soil.g2008 Apr., v. 305, no. 1-2 p.171-187dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl49373x0032-079X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11104-008-9538-z3Available from publisher's site 7aarticle02303naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001600151245009400167300001600261520110800277592002801385650001501413650002001428650002601448650001601474650001901490653001901509653001701528653002201545653002601567653003201593700002501625700002001650700002401670700002501694773010401719856008501823852000901908655001201917IND60411437320221123034930.0150925e20151102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6041143732DNAL7 a10.1080/15481603.2015.10751802doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPaul, Arati10aBand selection in hyperspectral imagery using spatial cluster mean and genetic algorithms  ap. 643-659.  aDimensionality reduction of hyperspectral images is essential for reduction of computational complexity and faster analysis. A novel method for band reduction has been proposed here, which has been adapted from the genetic algorithm (GA) along with spatial clustering. Spatial clustering generates overall signature variation present in a particular scene and in turn removes huge redundancy present in the raster data set. GA is applied on the clustered signatures to extract the reduced set of bands that is computed to be the “fittest” i.e., those bands that provide the most discriminating information in a hyperspectral image. This has been computed by taking the sum of Kullback–Leibler divergences (KLD) between consecutive selected bands. A higher KLD value amongst adjacent selected band implies higher divergence in value. The selected band-set image has been classified and the accuracy indices are evaluated respectively. The proposed method shows high performance on the basis of classification accuracy and efficient execution while comparing with two other state-of-the-art methods.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3adata collection 3ahyperspectral imagery 3araster data 3aremote sensing 0aband reduction 0acluster mean 0agenetic algorithm 0ahyperspectral imagery 0aunsupervised band selection1 aBhattacharya, Susmit1 aDutta, Dibyendu1 aSharma, Jaswant Raj1 aDadhwal, Vinay Kumar0 tGIScience & Remote Sensing.g2015 Nov. 2, v. 52, no. 6 p.643-659dTaylor & Francisx1943-72267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15481603.2015.10751803Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03346naa a2200661 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003800113040001800151100002500169245018000194300001600374520105800390592002801448650002501476650001701501650001401518650002101532650002001553650001401573650001001587650001101597650001801608650001501626650001601641650002401657650001201681650007401693650002801767650005701795650002101852650001101873650004101884650002101925650005701946650001102003650000902014650004302023650004502066650003402111650006002145650004602205650002402251650005602275650004102331700002302372700002402395700002102419700002002440700002602460700002202486773010402508856005102612852000902663655001202672IND50076200820221122054150.0140410e20130201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007620082DNAL7 a234416152pmid7 a10.1080/01635581.2013.7492922doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLewandowska, Urszula10aFlavanols from Japanese Quince (Chaenomeles Japonica) Fruit Inhibit Human Prostate and Breast Cancer Cell Line Invasiveness and Cause Favorable Changes in Bax/Bcl-2 mRNA Ratio  ap. 273-285.  aPolyphenols are natural compounds of high structural diversity which translates into a very wide spectrum of biological activities, including chemoprevention. Here we report that a Japanese quince fruit flavanol preparation (JQFFP) caused favorable changes in Bax/Bcl-2 mRNA ratio, which rendered normal and cancer cells more resistant and more sensitive, respectively, to apoptosis. DU145 human prostate cancer cells were characterized by the most advantageous Bax/Bcl-2 ratio. The growth and invasiveness of MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer cells were strongly suppressed by JQFFP, which was accompanied with a decrease in MMP-9 activity and stimulation of TIMP-1 expression. Importantly, JQFFP did not decrease normal human prostate PNT1A cell number, whereas Bax/Bcl-2 ratio decreased which implies increased resistance to apoptosis. In conclusion, JQFFP exhibited a potent antiproliferative effect against cancer cells, inhibited their invasiveness, and decreased expression level of several genes involved in apoptosis, angiogenesis, and metastasis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChaenomeles japonica 3aangiogenesis 3aapoptosis 3abreast neoplasms 3achemoprevention 3aflavanols 3agenes 3ahumans 3amessenger RNA 3ametastasis 3apolyphenols 3aprostatic neoplasms 3aquinces 2aAntineoplastic Agents, Phytogenicxanalysisxchemistryxpharmacology. 2aApoptosisxdrug effects 2aBreast Neoplasmsxdrug therapyxgeneticsxpathology. 2aCell Line, Tumor 2aFemale 2aFlavonoidsxchemistryxpharmacology. 2aFruitxchemistry 2aGene Expression Regulation, Neoplasticxdrug effects 2aHumans 2aMale 2aMatrix Metalloproteinase 9xmetabolism 2aNeovascularization, Pathologicxgenetics 2aPhenolsxanalysisxchemistry. 2aProstatic Neoplasmsxdrug therapyxgeneticsxpathology. 2aProto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2xgenetics 2aRosaceaexchemistry 2aTissue Inhibitor of Metalloproteinase-1xmetabolism 2abcl-2-Associated X Proteinxgenetics1 aSzewczyk, Karolina1 aOwczarek, Katarzyna1 aHrabec, Zbigniew1 aPodsędek, Anna1 aKoziołkiewicz, Maria1 aHrabec, Elżbieta0 tNutrition and cancer.g2013 Feb. 1, v. 65, no. 2 p.273-285dTaylor & Francis Groupx1532-79147nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01635581.2013.749292  aDNAL 7aarticle03393naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245018400167500001900351520162300370592002801993650002402021650002602045650002502071650001502096650002202111650001502133650001102148650002902159650000902188650001602197650001002213650001202223650001702235650002402252650002102276650001402297650001502311650001302326650002402339650001302363650001502376650001202391651001302403653002002416653001802436700001302454700001702467700001802484700001402502700001302516700001502529700001902544700001802563773010402581856008502685852000902770655001202779IND60692495320221117050221.0200607e202006  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069249532DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envres.2020.1093932doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Zikang10aThermal effects on tissue distribution, liver biotransformation, metabolism and toxic responses in Mongolia racerunner (Eremias argus) after oral administration of beta-cyfluthrin  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aEffects of temperature on metabolism/biotransformation and toxicokinetics to lizards are significant, but frequently ignored in toxicology studies. Beta-cyfluthrin (BC) is a pyrethroid insecticide and has been widely used globally. The study aimed to understand the diverse adverse effects of BC to the lizard (Eremias argus) at different temperature regimes. We carried out a single oral BC treatment (20 mg/kg bw) for toxicokinetic study and a 7-day BC (10 mg/kg bw) gavage to look at toxicology by monitoring changes in the biomarkers HSP70, SOD, MDA, CarE, UDPGT, GST, cyp genes, and other metabolic responses. Results showed that BC was lethal to lizards, showing oxidative damages in the liver at ambient temperature (25 °C). Heat stress (35 °C) could exacerbate the oxidative damage (MDA increased) caused by BC, due to the disorder of the antioxidant defense system. The result of tissue distribution and toxicokinetic study also showed that temperature affected the BC biotransformation in lizards. The biotransformation of BC maybe relates to the activation of CarE and UDGPT by heat stress. However, the cyp system and GST didn't increase under BC or/and heat treatments. ¹H-NMR metabolomics analysis showed that BC or/and heat stress interfered with energy and amino acid metabolism of the liver. Unlike acute lethal toxicity, the occurrence of the BC and heat stresses has detrimental effects on lizard individuals and populations on sub-lethal levels. Our results indicate that pollution and global warming (or some other extremely weather) may generate significant and harmful effects on lizards.  aPublisher supplied data 3aambient temperature 3aamino acid metabolism 3aantioxidant activity 3abiomarkers 3abiotransformation 3acyfluthrin 3aenergy 3aglucuronosyltransferases 3aheat 3aheat stress 3aliver 3alizards 3ametabolomics 3aoral administration 3apharmacokinetics 3apollution 3apyrethrins 3aresearch 3atissue distribution 3atoxicity 3atoxicology 3aweather 3aMongolia 0aBeta-cyfluthrin 0aEremias argus1 aChen, Li1 aZhang, Luyao1 aZhang, Wenjun1 aDeng, Yue1 aLiu, Rui1 aQin, Yinan1 aZhou, Zhiqiang1 aDiao, Jinling0 tEnvironmental research.g2020 June, v. 185 p.109393-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12442x0013-93517nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2020.1093933Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02096naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005900148245009500207300001400302520105000316592002801366650001701394650002001411650001301431650003601444650001401480650001301494651001701507651001101524651001001535773013401545856008201679852000901761655001201770IND60725640420221118020612.0210128e202101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072564042DNAL7 a10.1007/s00438-020-01725-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMahal, David G.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8277-593110aY-DNA genetic evidence reveals several different ancient origins in the Brahmin population  ap. 67-78.  aThe ancient geographical origins of Brahmins—a prominent ethnic group in the Indian subcontinent—have remained controversial for a long time. This study employed the AMOVA (analysis of molecular variance) test to evaluate genetic affinities of this group with thirty populations of Central Asia and Europe. A domestic comparison was performed with fifty non-Brahmin groups in India. The results showed that Brahmins had genetic affinities with several foreign populations and also shared their genetic heritage with several domestic non-Brahmin groups. The study identified the deep ancient origins of Brahmins by tracing their Y-chromosome haplogroups and genetic markers on the Y-DNA phylogenetic tree. It was confirmed that the progenitors of this group emerged from at least 12 different geographic regions of the world. The study concluded that about 83% of the Brahmins in the dataset belonged to four major haplogroups, of which two emerged from Central Asia, one from the Fertile Crescent, and one was of an indigenous Indian origin.  aPublisher supplied data 3aY chromosome 3adata collection 3agenomics 3anationalities and ethnic groups 3aphylogeny 3avariance 3aCentral Asia 3aEurope 3aIndia0 tMolecular genetics and genomics.g2021 Jan., v. 296, no. 1 p.67-78dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl69781x1617-46157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00438-020-01725-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02769naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002500150245006000175500001900235520143800254592002801692650001901720650002801739650003101767650001601798650001701814650002201831650001501853650001901868650001301887650000901900650001201909650001601921650001601937650002101953650001701974651001301991653002202004653003402026653003002060700002302090773010402113856008502217852000902302655001202311IND60692495420221117050531.0200607e202006  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069249542DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envres.2020.1093982doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aArifwidodo, Sigit D.10aUrban heat stress and human health in Bangkok, Thailand  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aHeat stress has been recognized as one of the consequences of climate change in urban areas. Its adverse effects on the urban population range from economy, social, environment, and human health. With the increasing urbanization and economic development in cities, heat stress is expected to worsen. This particular study aims to achieve two objectives: (1) to understand the determinants of heat stress, especially the roles of the urban environment in exacerbating the heat stress, and (2) to explore the effects of heat stress to human health using self-reported health assessment. We employed a cross-sectional study using a survey questionnaire from 505 respondents living in the urban area of Bangkok, Thailand. We found that socioeconomic conditions of the individual and urban environment were significant determinants of urban heat stress. Low-income urban populations living in high-density areas with less green open space were more likely to experience heat stress. We also found that heat stress significantly affects human health. Those who reported a higher level of heat stress were more likely to have adverse health and well-being outcomes. The findings suggest that the increased risk of heat stress represents a major problem in the Bangkok, Thailand. It is necessary to address heat stress in adaptation policy and measures at the city levels amid the continued increase of global temperature and climate change.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclimate change 3across-sectional studies 3ahealth effects assessments 3aheat stress 3ahuman health 3aissues and policy 3aopen space 3aquestionnaires 3aresearch 3arisk 3asurveys 3atemperature 3aurban areas 3aurban population 3aurbanization 3aThailand 0aUrban environment 0aSelf-assessed health outcomes 0aClimate change adaptation1 aChandrasiri, Orana0 tEnvironmental research.g2020 June, v. 185 p.109398-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12442x0013-93517nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2020.1093983Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01961naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002400140245007900164520097200243592002801215650002901243650001701272650002301289650001501312650001101327650002801338700002301366700002601389700002301415773012601438856007401564852000901638655001201647IND60652262720221119222232.0190712e20180514xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065226272DNAL7 a10.3390/su100515672doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSaviano, Marialuisa14aThe Cultural Value of Protected Areas as Models of Sustainable Development  aIn recognition of the urgent need to drive the transition to truly sustainable development, it is our belief that the divisions still distinguishing economic, social and environmental dimensions of human activities can impede the creation of conditions for sustainable development.

At the onset of gametogenesis, nutritive phagocytes accumulate nutrients and greatly increase in their size. As gametogenesis progresses, the accumulated nutrients are transferred from nutritive phagocytes into developing gametes, and size of the nutritive phagocytes decreases. An electron microscopic study of nutritive phagocytes in sea urchins, Strongylocentrotus intermedius, at different stages of annual reproductive cycle showed for the first time that both macro- and microautophagy take place in nutritive phagocytes. Both processes occur simultaneously and regulate size and composition of nutritive phagocytes in male and female sea urchins. Nutritive phagocytes consume redundant cytoplasm via macroautophagy. Microautophagy is probably involved in consumption of redundant membranes that appear within nutritive phagocytes due to destruction of nutrient-storing globules, macroautophagy, and phagocytosis of germ cells or their remnants.  aPublisher supplied data 3aStrongylocentrotus 3acytoplasm 3aelectron microscopy 3aepithelium 3afemales 3agametogenesis 3agerm cells 3amales 3anutrients 3aphagocytes 3aphagocytosis1 aYurchenko, Olga V.0 tProtoplasma.g2017 Jan., v. 254, no. 1 p.609-614dSpringer Viennax0033-183X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00709-016-0963-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03060naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245013400165300001600299520157800315592002801893650001901921650001601940650000901956650001901965650000701984650001301991650001802004653000802022653000802030653000802038653000802046653001002054653000802064653000802072653000802080653000802088653003002096653002202126653001802148653001602166653002802182700001202210700001802222700001702240700001402257700001502271700001802286773012202304856008302426852000902509655001202518IND60757152520221119051025.0220314e202203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075715252DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcis.2021.11.0762doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSun, Shuqing10aReal-time monitoring the interfacial dynamic processes at model cell membranes: Taking cell penetrating peptide TAT as an example  ap. 707-717.  aA real-time and molecule-level monitoring of the interfacial dynamic interactions between molecules and a cell membrane is of vital importance. Herein, taking TAT, one of the most representative cell penetrating peptides, as an example, a photo-voltage transient technique and a dynamic giant bistratal vesicle (GBV) leakage method were combined with the traditional giant unilamellar vesicle (GUV) leakage assays, to provide a molecule-level understanding of the dynamic membrane interaction process performed in a low ionic strength and neutral pH condition. The photo-voltage test based on supported phospholipid bilayers showed a quick disturbance (<1 min) followed by a continuous reconstruction of the membrane by peptides, leading to a slight destruction (at TAT concentrations lower than 1 μg mL⁻¹, i.e., 0.64 μM) or strong damage (e.g. at 10 μg mL⁻¹, i.e., 6.4 μM) of the bilayer structure. The GUV/GBV leakage assays further demonstrated the TAT-induced membrane deformation and transmembrane diffusion of dyes, which occurred in an immediate, linear, and TAT-concentration dependent manner. Moreover, the flux of dye across the substrate-immobilized membranes was approximately three times of that across the substrate-free ones. This work gives information on time and molecular mechanism of the TAT-membrane interactions, demonstrates the different permeabilizing effects of TAT on immobilized and free membranes. Overall, it provides useful strategies to investigate the nano-bio interfacial interactions in a simple, global and real-time way.  aPublisher supplied data 3acell membranes 3adeformation 3adyes 3aionic strength 3apH 3apeptides 3aphospholipids 0aGBV 0aGUV 0aSPB 0aAFM 0aQCM-D 0aSHG 0aSFG 0aNMR 0aCPP 0aPeptide-lipid interaction 0aGUV leakage assay 0aPhoto-voltage 0aTAT peptide 0aGiant bistratal vesicle1 aXia, Yu1 aLiu, Jiaojiao1 aDou, Yujiang1 aYang, Kai1 aYuan, Bing1 aKang, Zhenhui0 tJournal of colloid and interface science.g2022 Mar., v. 609 p.707-717dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12461x0021-97977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcis.2021.11.0763Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01346naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001700144245009700161506002800258520033600286592002800622506003700650650001000687650001400697651001200711653001600723653001100739653001700750700002000767700001700787773012800804856007900932852000901011655001201020IND60785354820221207051908.0190501s2012    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078535482DNAL7 a10.5281/zenodo.25438562doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOpalko, O.A.10aPhylogenetic relationships in the representatives of genus Malus Mill. cultivated in Ukraine  aResource is Open Access  aResults of investigations curried out by the scientists of different countries, including molecular genetic studies, on the origin of genus Malus Mill. and their closest congeners, which may form the basis for a revised classification system for the genus and its taxonomic position within the Rosaceae Juss. family are considered.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aMalus 3aphylogeny 3aUkraine 0aMalus Mill. 0aorigin 0agenus system1 aChernenko, A.D.1 aOpalko, A.I.0 tÌntrodukcìâ roslin.g2012, v. 53dNAS of Ukraine, M.M.

This biofabrication of complex living products by using various bioengineering techniques is a potential solution to reduce the ill effects of current meat production systems and can dramatically transform traditional animal-based agriculture by inventing “animal-free” meat and meat products. Nutrition-related diseases, food-borne illnesses, resource use and pollution, and use of farm animals are some serious consequences associated with conventional meat production methods. This new way of animal-free meat production may offer health and environmental advantages by reducing environmental pollution and resource use associated with current meat production systems and will also ensure sustainable production of designer, chemically safe, and disease-free meat as the conditions in an in vitro meat production system are controllable and manipulatable. Theoretically, this system is believed to be efficient enough to supply the global demand for meat; however, establishment of a sustainable in vitro meat production would face considerably greater technical challenges and a great deal of research is still needed to establish this animal-free meat culturing system on an industrial scale.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiofabrication 3aenvironmental health 3afarmed animal species 3afoodborne illness 3ameat 3ameat production 3apollution 3aproduction technology 3atissue engineering 0aIn vitro meat 0ahistory 0atechniques 0abenefits 0aobjections1 aKumar, Sunil1 aBhat, Hina Fayaz0 tCritical reviews in food science and nutrition.g2017 Mar. 4, v. 57, no. 4 p.782-789dTaylor & Francisx1549-78527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10408398.2014.9248993Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02082naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002500151245011200176300001600288520101000304592002801314650001101342650001801353650001101371650001501382650001901397650001401416650001101430651001801441651001701459700001901476700001501495700001601510773010001526856008501626852000901711655001201720IND60411437920221123034904.0150925e20151102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6041143792DNAL7 a10.1080/2150704X.2015.10845492doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChakraborty, Abhisek10aOn the prediction of storm surges during super cyclone Phailin using a deterministic ensemble Kalman filter  ap. 814-823.  aDeterministic ensemble Kalman filter has been used to assimilate data from the tracks of three existing altimeters in a state-of-the-art hydrodynamic model configured for the north Indian Ocean. The assimilation period has been chosen to cover the entire time history of the super cyclone Phailin occurring in the Bay of Bengal basin of the north Indian Ocean in mid-October 2013. The filter was proposed in a previous study in which the authors showed its advantage over the existing ensemble-based filter techniques. Different combinations of localization radii and inflation factors have been tried to find the optimum combination. Assimilation with this combination has been found to exhibit significant positive impact on basin-scale simulations of sea level. This conclusion has been further corroborated by comparing the surges simulated by the model with tide-gauge data acquired during the occurrence of Phailin. Assimilation has been also found to enhance the predictive capability of the model.  aPublisher supplied data 3abasins 3ahydrodynamics 3amodels 3aprediction 3aremote sensing 3asea level 3astorms 3aBay of Bengal 3aIndian Ocean1 aSharma, Rashmi1 aKumar, Raj1 aBasu, Sujit0 tRemote sensing letters.g2015 Nov. 2, v. 6, no. 11 p.814-823dTaylor & Francisx2150-70587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/2150704X.2015.10845493Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02740naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245017000168500001900338520157300357592002801930650001701958650003001975650001302005650002202018653003002040653002502070653001402095653001302109700002402122700002702146700001902173773010402192856008502296852000902381655001202390IND60692495920221117050153.0200804e202007  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069249592DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envres.2020.1095612doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPeinado, F.M.10aInfluence of polychlorinated biphenyls and organochlorine pesticides on the inflammatory milieu. A systematic review of in vitro, in vivo and epidemiological studies  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aOrganochlorine pesticides (OCPs) and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are relevant families of persistent organic pollutants, which have been linked to several long-term adverse health effects. The mechanisms of action of these pollutants are still poorly understood. However, there are some evidences suggesting that inflammation might play a key role on their effects.To systematically synthesize the published in vitro, in vivo and epidemiological data assessing the potential influence of exposure to OCPs and PCBs on the development of an inflammatory milieu.A systematic review of peer-reviewed original research papers published until 1st May 2019 was conducted, by using Medline, Web of Science and Scopus databases. A total of 39 articles met the inclusion criteria and were evaluated in this review.The majority of the studies showed significant associations of PCB and OCP exposure with all inflammatory markers measured (n = 30). Some studies showed positive and negative associations (n = 7) and only two studies evidenced negative associations (n = 2). Most of the available evidences came from in vitro and in vivo studies (n = 31), with few epidemiological studies (n = 8).We found consistent positive associations between exposure to PCBs and OCPs and the development of a pro-inflammatory milieu, with only few discrepancies. However, given the limited epidemiological evidence found, our results warrant further research in order to elucidate the real contribution of these pollutants on the inflammatory processes and subsequent diseases.  aPublisher supplied data 3ainflammation 3apolychlorinated biphenyls 3aresearch 3asystematic review 0aOrganochlorine pesticides 0aInflammatory markers 0aCytokines 0aExposure1 aArtacho-Cordón, F.1 aBarrios-Rodríguez, R.1 aArrebola, J.P.0 tEnvironmental research.g2020 July, v. 186 p.109561-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12442x0013-93517nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2020.1095613Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03318naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002400147245009400171520184900265592002802114650001302142650002302155650001102178650001402189650002202203650002202225650002702247650002602274650001402300650002502314650001702339650001702356650001302373651001002386651001602396651000902412651001302421651001202434700001902446700001902465700002002484700002002504700002602524700002602550700002202576773012302598856008202721852000902803655001202812IND60771396620221119192948.0220325e20220310xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077139662DNAL7 a10.3390/pathogens110303342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAl-Hamidhi, Salama 10aDiversity and Genetic Structure of Theileria annulata in Pakistan and Other Endemic Sites  aBackground: Theileria annulata is a tick-borne protozoan parasite responsible for bovine theileriosis, a disease that impacts cattle population in many developing countries. Development and deployment of effective control strategies, based on vaccine or therapy, should consider the extent of diversity of the parasite and its population structure in different endemic areas. In this study, we examined T. annulata in Pakistan and carried out a comparative analysis with similar data garneted in other areas, to provide further information on the level of parasite diversity and parasite genetic structure in different endemic areas. Methods: The present study examined a set of 10 microsatellites/minisatellites and analyzed the genetic structure of T. annulata in cattle breeds from Pakistan (Indian sub-continent) and compared these with those in Oman (Middle East), Tunisia (Africa), and Turkey (Europe). Result: A high level of genetic diversity was observed among T. annulata detected in cattle from Pakistan, comparable to that in Oman, Tunisia, and Turkey. The genotypes of T. annulata in these four countries form genetically distinct groups that are geographically sub-structured. The T. annulata population in Oman overlapped with that in the Indian Subcontinent (Pakistan) and that in Africa (Tunisia). Conclusions: The T. annulata parasite in Pakistan is highly diverse, and genetically differentiated. This pattern accords well and complements that seen among T. annulata representing the global endemic site. The parasite population in the Arabian Peninsula overlapped with that in the Indian-Subcontinent (India) and that in Africa (Tunisia), which shared some genotypes with that in the Near East and Europe (Turkey). This suggests some level of parasite gene flow, indicative of limited movement between neighboring countries.  aPublisher supplied data 3aProtozoa 3aTheileria annulata 3acattle 3agene flow 3agenetic structure 3agenetic variation 3amicrosatellite repeats 3aminisatellite repeats 3aparasites 3apopulation structure 3atheileriosis 3atherapeutics 3avaccines 3aIndia 3aMiddle East 3aOman 3aPakistan 3aTunisia1 aParveen, Asia 1 aIqbal, Furhan 1 aAsif, Muhammad 1 aAkhtar, Naheed 1 aElshafie, Elshafie I.1 aBeja-Pereira, Albano 1 aBabiker, Hamza A.0 tPathogens.g2022 Mar. 10, v. 11, no. 3dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27146x2076-08177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/pathogens110303343Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02514naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245015600164300001800320500001500338520113400353592002801487650001501515650001801530650001101548650002301559650002201582650001301604650000701617650001901624650001101643650001601654650001801670650001101688651001401699653001601713700001801729700002001747700002901767700002101796700002101817700002401838773009201862856008101954852000902035655001202044IND50068402720221118033700.0140819e201308  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006840272DNAL7 a10.1007/s00227-012-2072-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aArnberg, Maj10aElevated temperature elicits greater effects than decreased pH on the development, feeding and metabolism of northern shrimp (Pandalus borealis) larvae  ap. 2037-2048.  a2019-12-06  aClimate models predict that the average temperature in the North Sea could increase 3-5 A degrees C and surface-waters pH could decrease 0.3-0.5 pH units by the end of this century. Consequently, we investigated the combined effect of decreased pH (control pH 8.1; decreased pH 7.6) and temperature (control 6.7 A degrees C; elevated 9.5 A degrees C) on the hatching timing and success, and the zoeal development, survival, feeding, respiration and growth (up to stage IV zoea) of the northern shrimp, Pandalus borealis. At elevated temperature, embryos hatched 3 days earlier, but experienced 2-4 % reduced survival. Larvae developed 9 days faster until stage IV zoea under elevated temperature and exhibited an increase in metabolic rates (ca 20 %) and an increase in feeding rates (ca 15-20 %). Decreased pH increased the development time, but only at the low temperature. We conclude that warming will likely exert a greater effect on shrimp larval development than ocean acidification manifesting itself as accelerated developmental rates with greater maintenance costs and decreased recruitment in terms of number and size.  aPublisher supplied data 3ametabolism 3aacidification 3aoceans 3alarval development 3aPandalus borealis 3ahatching 3apH 3aclimate models 3alarvae 3atemperature 3asurface water 3ashrimp 3aNorth Sea 0arecruitment1 aCalosi, Piero1 aSpicer, John I.1 aTandberg, Anne Helene S.1 aNilsen, Marianne1 aWesterlund, Stig1 aBechmann, Renée K.0 tMarine biology.g2013 Aug., v. 160, no. 8 p.2037-2048dSpringer-Verlagx0025-31627nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00227-012-2072-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03497naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002400150245016100174500001900335520190000354592002802254650001002282650001602292650001502308650002002323650002902343650000902372650002702381650002602408650001302434650000902447650001002456650001002466650002202476650001302498650001002511650003102521653001702552653001802569653001802587653001302605653001102618653003602629700002502665700002302690700001702713700002302730773012002753856008502873852000902958655001202967IND60692496020221117050618.0201209e202009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069249602DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envres.2020.1095622doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEngelsman, Michelle10aBiomonitoring in firefighters for volatile organic compounds, semivolatile organic compounds, persistent organic pollutants, and metals: A systematic review  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aFirefighters are exposed to a wide range of toxic chemicals due to combustion, with numerous biomonitoring studies completed that have assessed exposure. Many of these studies focus on individual classes of chemicals, with a few considering a broad range of systemic exposures. As yet, no review process has been undertaken to comprehensively examine these studies. The aims of this review are to: (1) ascertain whether biomonitoring studies pertaining to firefighters demonstrate occupational exposure to volatile organic compounds, semivolatile organic compounds, and metals; (2) determine and present results of biomonitoring studies; (3) provide any recommendations presented from the literature that may support exposure mitigation; and (4) suggest future study parameters that may assist in providing a greater understanding surrounding the occupational exposure of firefighters. A systematic review was undertaken with regards to firefighters and biomonitoring studies utilising the matrices of blood, urine, semen and breast milk. This yielded 5690 results. Following duplicate removal, inclusion and exclusion criteria screening and full text screening, 34 studies remained for review. Results of over 80% of studies analysed determined firefighters to experience occupational exposure. Results also show firefighters to be exposed to a wide range of toxic chemicals due to fire smoke; potentially exceeding the range of exposure of other occupations. As firefighters may face increased risk of health effects due to the additive, synergistic, and/or antagonistic effects of chemical exposure, all care must be taken to reduce exposure. This may be achieved by considering tactical decisions, increased personal hygiene, and thorough decontamination procedures. Future biomonitoring studies recognising and assessing the range of chemical exposure firefighters face would be beneficial.  aPublisher supplied data 3ablood 3abreast milk 3acombustion 3adecontamination 3aenvironmental monitoring 3aface 3agood hygiene practices 3aoccupational exposure 3aresearch 3arisk 3asemen 3asmoke 3asystematic review 3atoxicity 3aurine 3avolatile organic compounds 0aFirefighting 0aFire fighters 0aBiomonitoring 0aExposure 0aMetals 0aSemi-volatile organic compounds1 aToms, Leisa-Maree L.1 aBanks, Andrew P.W.1 aWang, Xianyu1 aMueller, Jochen F.0 tEnvironmental research.g2020 Sept., v. 188 p.109562-dElsevier Inc.aElsevier Inc.wJournal:12442x0013-93517nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2020.1095623Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle
